Over a career that spanned 55 years, he designed close to five hundred motion picture and television main and end title sequences for top directors such as Francis Ford Coppola, John Huston, Mike Nichols, Robert Redford, Roman Polanski, Arthur Penn, Michael Cimino, Warren Beatty, Herbert Ross, John Hughes, and Quentin Tarantino. Film title work A native of Los Angeles, Fitzgerald graduated from Art Center College of Design in 1951, and went to work at Pacific Title & Art Studio. His first major motion picture title design was for MGM's Raintree County (1957). He worked on a great many titles during his 17-year tenure at Pacific Title, becoming head of the art and design department. During that time, Pacific Title did all the motion picture title work for Warner Bros., MGM, and 20th Century Fox, as well as some for Paramount Pictures and Columbia Pictures, plus independents. Neither Pacific Title nor its employees received title design credit. As a result, Fitzgerald did not receive credit for many of his early designs, such as The Three Faces of Eve (1957), Imitation of Life (1959), Pillow Talk (also 1959), The Music Man (1962), My Fair Lady (1964); or for early television shows such as Maverick (1957), Mister Ed (1961), The Beverly Hillbillies (1962), and Alfred Hitchcock's Suspicion. In addition to providing an entertaining background for the credits, Fitzgerald's titles often set the mood. For The Music Man he directed a group of 35 technicians who built sets and painted and animated the musical instruments and marching band. He then shot and edited the sequence. In the film Max Dugan Returns (1983), the title character does not appear for half an hour. Fitzgerald's titles with Bob Kurtz animation provided a background for the character.Forget the film, watch the titles For Bonnie and Clyde (1967), Fitzgerald used old snapshots and a quick-cut style driven by sound that melded seamlessly with film editor Dede Allen's editorial style. The photos established the mood and look of the 1930s, and referenced the fact that Bonnie and Clyde were known for taking snapshots of themselves, which they sent to the press. Until the music starts to fade in, the only sound is the click of a Brownie camera.The importance of a singular, guiding vision: an interview with Arthur Penn. - Free Online Library While working together on Bonnie and Clyde, Warren Beatty convinced Fitzgerald to strike out on his own. He left his job as head of the art department at Pacific Title and formed Wayne Fitzgerald FilmDesign. Chinatown (1974), Nine to Five (1980), Footloose (1984), Total Recall (1990), to name a few, followed. In addition to opening titles, Fitzgerald shot second unit and edited montage sequences for Rocky III and Tootsie (both 1982). Fitzgerald also continued to design titles for prime time television shows Night Gallery (1971), McMillan & Wife (1971), Dallas (1978), Matlock (1986), and Columbo (1971‚Äì75). He won an Emmy Award in 1987 for The Bronx Zoo. He also designed for the daytime soap operas The Bold and the Beautiful (CBS) 1987 (EMMY 1987), One Life to Live (ABC) 1984, and The Guiding Light (CBS) 1991 (EMMY 1992), and again in 2002 with his son Eric Fitzgerald, also a title designer. In 1993 Fitzgerald briefly joined the digital graphic design firm, Pittard-Sullivan. It became Pittard-Sullivan- Fitzgerald. Fitzgerald's last work with the company was in 1995, after which he reformed his company, Wayne Fitzgerald FilmDesign, Inc.Whitney, Daisy A Legacy of Innovation: Pittard Sullivan Was Once Synonymous With Broadcast Design Television Week 20 June 2005 In 1995, Fitzgerald designed the logo for the Motion Picture Editors Guild. Personal life Fitzgerald was a member of the Directors Guild of America. He was a two-term governor in the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, representing title designers, and a member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. He lectured at UCLA and AFI, and participated in panel discussions in Los Angeles and New York. He also taught at Art Center College of Design. Fitzgerald died September 30, 2019.

Some of the verses of Mulaccara are almost same as those found in Svetambara's Dasavaikalika. This suggests the existence of an ancient shared textual tradition between Digambaras and Svetambaras, one that likely split and differentiated later.

Liberal legalism has also been called legal constitutionalism, such as is found in United States and Germany, with political constitutionalism, which is more typical of Britain, by British constitutional scholar Adam Tomkins. He argues in his book Our Republican Constitution that the British system of governance, in which Parliament controls government ministers, provides a better check on executive power than a system like that of the United States, where courts and laws are used to check executive power. Loughlin argues that the aim of legal-liberalism is to \\"confine politics to the straight-jacket of law.\\"In Defence of the Political Constitution, Tomkins, Oxford Journal of Legal Studies, Vol 22, No 1 (2002), p162 Tomkins argues that courts and constitutions are a poor check on executive or legislative authority since they must wait for court decisions to bubble up from lesser courts before they can act; since this process can take years, even decades, to happen, the court is usually slow to act. Tomkins prefers a parliamentary system like Britain's as being \\"more suitable and more effective\\" at restraining governments, and sees flaws in the American system of having courts check executive power.

Japanese-English Character Dictionary. pages 539, 960 was third and final vessel in the Nokaze sub-class, an improvement to the 1st class destroyers, built for the Imperial Japanese Navy immediately following World War I. Advanced for their time, these ships served as first-line destroyers through the 1930s, but were considered obsolescent by the start of the Pacific War. History Construction of the large-sized Minekaze-class destroyers was authorized as part of the Imperial Japanese Navy's 8-4 Fleet Program from fiscal 1917 with nine vessels, and fiscal 1918 with an additional six vessels. However, the final three vessels in the fiscal 1918 were built to a different design and have a different enough silhouette that many authors consider them to be a separate class. Numakaze, built at the Maizuru Naval Arsenal, was the third ship of this sub-class. The destroyer was laid down on 10 August 1921, launched on 25 February 1922 and commissioned on 27 July 1922. On completion, Numakaze was teamed with , and flagship to form Destroyer Division 1 (Á¨¨‰∏ÄÈßÜÈÄêËâ¶). In 1938-1939, the Division was assigned to patrols of the northern and central China coastlines in support of Japanese combat operations in the Second Sino- Japanese War =World War II history= At the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor, Numakaze was based at the ≈åminato Guard District in northern Japan, and was assigned to patrols of the Hokkaid≈ç and Chishima Islands coastlines. During the Battle of Midway in May 1942, Numakaze was assigned to the reserve force for the Aleutian Islands Operation, which did not leave Japanese waters. Afterwards, she returned to patrol and escort duties based out of ≈åminato through July 1943, when the ship was assigned temporarily to the IJN 5th Fleet for the mission to evacuate surviving Japanese forces from Kiska. On 6 June 1943, Numakaze suffered damage in a collision with the destroyer . Numakaze continued to be based at ≈åminato for patrol and escort in northern waters until December 1943. In December 1943, Numakaze was reassigned to the Combined Fleet, departing from Moji on 5 December as part of the 1st Surface Escort Division escorting a convoy to Taiwan. However, on 18 December 1943, Numakaze, while chasing the wake of the submarine , was hit by a torpedo, blew up and sank east-northeast of Naha, Okinawa at position . The destroyer was lost with all hands, including the commanding officer of DesDiv 1, Commander Watanabe Yasumasa. On 5 February 1944 Numakaze was removed from navy list.Brown.

With 80,000m¬≤ in palace area and over 950.000m¬≤ in premises, it is one the largest palaces in the world. It is one of the Residences of the Royal House of Savoy, included in the UNESCO Heritage List in 1997. The Palace was designed and built from 1675 by Amedeo di Castellamonte, commissioned by duke Charles Emmanuel II, who needed a base for his hunting expeditions in the heathy hill country north of Turin. The name itself derives from Latin, Venatio Regia meaning \\"Royal Hunt\\". It was enlarged to become a luxurious residence for the House of Savoy. The palace complex became a masterpiece of Baroque architecture, and was filled with decoration and artwork. It fell into disuse at the end of the 18th century. After the Napoleonic wars, it was used for military purposes until 1978, when its renovation begun, leading to the largest restoration project in European history. It opened to the public on October 13, 2007, and it has since become a major tourist attraction and exhibition space. It is noted for its monumental architecture and Baroque interiors by Filippo Juvarra, including the Galleria Grande and its marble decorations, the chapel of St. Uberto, and its extensive gardens. It received 1,048,857 visitors in 2017, making it the sixth most visited museum in Italy. History Charles Emmanuel was inspired by the example of the Castle of Mirafiori, built by Duke Charles Emmanuel I for his wife Catherine Michelle of Spain. Keen to leave a memorial of himself and his wife, Marie Jeanne of Savoy-Nemours, he bought the two small villages of Altessano Superiore and Altessano Inferiore from the Milanese-origin Birago family, who had created here a large complex of plants. The place was rechristened Venaria for his future function as hunting base (Venatio, in Latin). The construction of this residence fell in the larger plan of surrounding the city of Turin with a garland of delicacies (Corona di Delizie), which included the Palazzina di caccia of Stupinigi, Castle of Rivoli, Villa della Regina, and others. Main entrance and towers built by Garove The design was commissioned in 1658 to architects Amedeo di Castellamonte and . The project envisioned a grandiose ensemble of palace, gardens, hunting woods, and a new city, bearing a noteworthy scenographic impact. Tdjacent town's plan was circular to reflect the round shape of the collar of the Supreme Order of the Most Holy Annunciation, a dynastic order created by the House of Savoy. In 1675 the borough and the palace were nearly completed, including the so-called Reggia di Diana (Royal Residence of Diana, the heart of the complex. Works however continued until the next century, as in 1693 French invasion troops are known to have destroyed some buildings and Duke (future King) Victor Amadeus II had the residence modified according to French canons, with the intent of rivalling the Palace of Versailles. Starting in 1699, the new project director was Michelangelo Garove, who followed Victor Amadeus' intent of building an ever more grandiose palace. Further damage was inflicted during the Siege of Turin (1706), when the French troops under Louis d'Aubusson de La Feuillade were garrisoned there. After the Savoyard victory, Victor Amadeus placed Filippo Juvarra in charge of the project in 1716. Juvarra completed the chapel, the Great Gallery, the Citronerie, and the stable, elevating the palace to a Baroque masterpiece. During the reign of Charles Emmanuel III, under the direction of Benedetto Alfieri, the palace was enlarged with new stables, galleries, and supporting buildings. With the fall of the Ancien R√©gime, the palace fell in disuse. During the Napoleonic domination, the structures were turned into barracks and the gardens destroyed to create a training ground. The complex maintained this role also after the fall of Napoleon, and was used by the Italian Army until 1978, when it was sold to the Ministry of Culture. Restoration works were begun in 1999, and encapsulated the palace, gardens, and the historic center of the town. It was the largest restoration project in European history, with 100.000 m2 of buildings area, 1.000 frescoes, 9.5000 m2 stuccoes, 800.000 m2 garden area being renovated. The complex was open for tourism from 13 October 2007, and has since become a major turist destination and space for exhibitions and events. Architecture=The Palace= The Galleria Grande The entrance of the palace leads into the Cour d'honneur (\\"Honour Court\\"), which once housed a fountain with a deer. The main facade, covered in the 17th century section with plaster and featuring cornucopias, shells and fruits, is connected on the right by section with exposed brickwork added in the 18th century. The two towers date to the Michelangelo Garove period (1669‚Äì1713) and are covered with multicolor pentagonal tiles in ceramics, which are united by a large gallery, known as Galleria Grande. The interiors originally housed a large collection of stuccos, statues, paintings (according to Amedeo di Castellamonte, up to 8,000) from some of the court artists of the times, such as Vittorio Amedeo Cignaroli, and Bernardino Quadri. =Gardens= The original gardens of the residence are now totally disappeared, since French troops turned them into training grounds. Earlier drawings show an Italian garden with three terraces connected by elaborate stairways and architectural features such as a clock tower in the first court, the fountain of Hercules, a theater and parterres. Recent works have recreated a park in modern style, exhibiting modern works by Giuseppe Penone, including a fake 12 m-high cedar housing the thermic discharges of the palace. =Church of Sant'Uberto and other 18th century additions= Interior of the chapel of S. Uberto After the death of Garove (1713), Juvarra built the Grand Gallery and in parallel built a church dedicated to St. Hubertus, patron of the hunters (1716‚Äì1729). The church is strictly included within the palace's structure, so that it was impossible to build a dome: this was then frescoes trompe-l'oeil from inside. Other works of the Juvarra period included the stables, the citroneria (fruit grows, 1722‚Äì1728) and the renovation in French-style of the facades. The last buildings date from the mid-18th and early 19th centuries (stables, riding school, stair of the Reggia di Diana, gallery of Sant'Uberto); subsequently the Palace was abandoned in favour of the Palazzina di Caccia di Stupinigi (1729), which was by then more in tune with the tastes of the European courts.

By resembling various features of a genuine coin, including the weight, size, and shape, a slug is designed to trick the machine into accepting it as a real coin. Losses caused to vendors by slug usage may be the result of the loss of sales, the absence of revenue following the distribution of merchandise that was obtained at the vendor's expense, or the loss of cash that is distributed by the machine for overpayment with slugs. Honest customers may also suffer losses when change returned for overpayment is in the form of a slug rather than a genuine coin. Though slug usage is illegal in the United States and elsewhere, prosecution for slug usage is rare due to the low value of the theft and the difficulty in identifying the offender. Offenders in casinos are most likely to be prosecuted, as casinos have high levels of video surveillance and other security measures, and tend to be more proactive in enforcement. Use of other currencies The 1000 Indonesian Rupiah coin, minted between 1993 and 2000, is very similar to the 2 Euro coin, while having approximately 1/30th the value. In some cases, a slug can be a genuine coin used in another country, with or without knowledge of the user. One example was the interchangeable use of Australian and New Zealand 5c, 10c and 20c pieces in both countries, from 1967 until 2006 (when New Zealand coins were redesigned). These coins were of the same material and size with near identical obverses, so could circulate outside their home country for some time, although the New Zealand coins were worth about 20% less, potentially resulting in a small gain (to those passing them) in Australia and a similar loss in New Zealand. The Canadian quarter was also accepted by at least some US vending machines interchangeably with the US quarter until at least 2001. The usefulness of this to offenders varied greatly over time; during the 1970s and 1980s, the Canadian and US quarters were very similar in value. The 10 Syrian pound coin is often used as a slug in Norway, as the shape and weight of this coin strongly resembles the 20 Norwegian krone coin. While not easy to find in Norway, the Syrian coins are still used in automated machines there with such frequency that Posten Norge, the Norwegian postal service, decided to close many of their coins-to-cash machines on February 18, 2006, with plans to develop a system able to differentiate between the two coins. In the summer of 2005, a Norwegian man was sentenced to 30 days, suspended, for having used Syrian coins in arcade machines in the municipality of B√¶rum. In the UK, during the late 1990s some coin-operated slot machines would accept two 1-schilling coins glued together as if they were a ¬£1 coin. The two original coins had a net value of under 10p at the current exchange rate. Coin detectors were soon reprogrammed to detect and reject the Austrian Schilling. Not long after it was possible to buy on the Internet a bag of 100 washers for under ¬£20 that had been deliberately made to fool the machines into accepting them as ¬£1 coins. Coin detectors were again reprogrammed to reject those slugs as well. The Irish pound coin in use from 1990 to 2002 was the same size as the old pre-decimal penny, so vending machines had to be modified to differentiate them. Many machines simply had the pound slot disabled with a riveted plate. Many coin-operated machines in Germany would accept the 1992, 1993 and 1995 stampings of the cupronickel Estonian 1 kroon coin as a German 1 mark coin. This was profitable for users of the Estonian coins as the kroon was pegged to the mark at a fixed rate of 8:1. All cupronickel 1 kroon coins were demonetized in May 1998 and the replacement aluminium-bronze Estonian 1 kroon coin was not interchangeable with the German mark in coin-operated machines. The use of 100-won coins for the slug of 100-yen coins and cupronickel 20-sen (RM 0.20) pieces still commonly occurs, contributing to the conflict between Japanese and Korean citizens. Similarly, until 2000, the Korean 500-won coin could be modified to match the weight of the original 500-yen coin which was otherwise identical in diameter and composition, and thereby used to fool weight-sensitive vending machines.The Contemporary \\"Won\\" Coins of the Republic of Korea (1966 ‚Äì Present) Dokdo Research (dokdo-research.com). Retrieved on 2017-05-05.Metropolis [Tokyo] Money Talks: Short Changed From the fall of the Soviet Union to the monetary reform in 1998, the Russian Federation often issued a commemorative one-ruble coin that was identical in size and weight to a 5 Swiss franc coin. For this reason, there have been several instances of these (worthless) ruble coins being used on a large scale to defraud automated vending machines in Switzerland. In the US, Connecticut Turnpike tokens had a value of 17.5 cents in the early 1980s, but due to having a similar design as New York City subway tokens worth 75 cents it became common for commuters to use the Turnpike tokens on the subway. The matter went unresolved for three years; users were not prosecuted, but when Connecticut discontinued tolls on the Turnpike, they agreed to redeem the roughly two million tokens from the MTA at face value. In 1988, Thailand started minting a bimetallic ten baht coin that is quite similar to the 2 Euro coin (first issue in 2002) in weight, size and appearance. Because it is worth substantially less, it has been used to fool cashiers and automated vending machines since the very first days of the 2 Euro coin circulation. In the United Arab Emirates on August 2006, it became publicly known that the Philippines' ‚Ç±1 coin has the same size as the 1 United Arab Emirates dirham coin. With one dirham having a value nearly 14 times that of one Philippine peso, this has led to vending machine fraud in the United Arab Emirates. Similar frauds have also occurred in the US, as the 1-peso coin (worth about two U.S. cents) is roughly the same size as the quarter. Newer digital parking meters are not affected by the fraud, though most vending machines will accept them as quarters. Composition comparison Slugs are usually made from metals differing from those of real coins. While genuine US coinage is made from various alloys of copper, nickel, and zinc, Canadian coins are made mostly from steel with some copper and nickel, and euro coins are made from steel, nickel, and brass, slugs are frequently made from differing metals and alloys that are cheaper to obtain and mold, such as aluminum, tin, and lead. Slugs may or may not have the face details of real coins. Some slugs that are made to match the face details may not be immediately recognizable as such to handlers, and may enter circulation. Older, cheaper, and other low-tech machines that have fewer security measures are more likely to be defrauded by slug users. As an example, the full- mechanical mechanisms still used today in candy machines can be fooled by a cardboard coin. Many newer machines, especially those found in casinos, have additional detection that can identify more details of coins and detect those that do not resemble real coins.

He played a huge role in a Christian revival in southwestern Uganda, but had to flee in 1973 to neighboring Kenya in fear for his life after speaking out against Idi Amin's tyrannical behavior. Kivengere had been made bishop of Kigezi and was among several bishops summoned to Amin's quarters. Angry mobs called for their deaths. Eventually, all were permitted to leave but one, the archbishop, Janani Luwum. The others waited for Luwum to join them but he never came out. The next day the government announced that Luwum had died in an automobile accident. Four days later, despite government threats, 45,000 Ugandans gathered in the Anglican cathedral in Kampala for a memorial service honoring their fallen leader. Kivengere did not attend the service. Urged to flee by friends who said, \\"One dead bishop is enough,\\" he and his wife that night drove as far as their vehicle could take them and with the help of local church people in the hills they walked until the next morning brought them to safety across the border in Rwanda.Schmidt, Richard H. Glorious Companions: Five Centuries of Anglican Spirituality. Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 2002, p. 314. He later authored the book I Love Idi Amin to emphasize the qualities of forgiveness for those who wronged you and love of those who persecute you. Kivengere stated, \\"On the cross, Jesus said, 'Father, forgive them, because they know not what they do.' As evil as Idi Amin is, how can I do less toward him?\\"Quinn, Frederick. Dictionary of African Christian Biography http://www.dacb.org/stories/uganda/kivengere_festo.html. A second article about Kivengere is found in the same online dictionary. Bishop Festo was invited by Michael Cassidy to join African Enterprise in 1969 and to build up a team of AE evangelists in East Africa. In 1975, Kivengere shared the Bible Expositor post at Eurofest '75 with Luis Palau. Eurofest '75 was co-sponsored by the Billy Graham organisation and was held in Brussels, Belgium at the Palais du Centenaire and the Heysel Stadium from 24 July til 2 August. He returned to Uganda after Amin's downfall to continue an active ministry until his death by leukemia in 1988. Kivengere was known as a great storyteller and often thrilled his own and other's children with his storytelling skills. A favorite story of his: \\"One day a little girl sat watching her mother working in the kitchen. She asked her mummy, 'What does God do all day long?' For a while the mother was stumped, but then she said, 'Darling, I'll tell you what God does all day long. He spends his whole day mending broken things.'\\"Related in Schmidt, p. 320. Incidentally, Schmidt reports that Kivengere was at one time invited to join the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association as an associate evangelist.

History The Festival was founded by Carol Polcovar in 2002 as a merger of New Village Playwrights and New Village Productions reacted to a current reluctance on the part of major venues to present a truly representative array of LGBT arts. Originally sponsored by All Out Arts, Inc., a 501(c)(3) NY State non-profit since 1991, it shortly became a fully owned D.B.A. of All Out Arts. The Festival includes a wide range of plays, visual arts, dance, and film presentations. Along with the Hot! Festival, it is among the most prominent LGBT-themed festivals in the New York artistic community. Carol Polcovar served as Founding Artistic Director of the festival for its first decade, and upon retirement in 2013 accepted an \\"Outstanding Achievement\\" Award for the Fresh Fruit Festival's mission from the Manhattan Borough President's Office.\\"I honor your commitment to the arts as a profoundly effective weapon against all forms of prejudice.\\" -May 15, 2013- Gale A. Brewer, Borough President of Manhattan Ancillary programs The Festival presented the first of several \\"OUTmusic\\" programs in New York City, consisting entirely of vocalists, musicians, and composers who were Lesbian, Gay, Bi, or Transgendered. As Outmusic became an organization, All Out Arts served as their fiscal conduit and aided their becoming a unique organization. Outmusic is now a national foundation, sponsoring National Outmusic Awards since 2001. In 2006 the Festival presented the first event solely dedicated to and entirely by LGBT Native Americans. Native American elder Kent Lebsock presided over the opening convocation, and the event included members of the Cherokee, Mohawk, Chikasaw, Navajo, Creek, Lakota, Kumeyaay and Cree tribes. The Festival produces an annual winter OUT-wright Program, which facilitates developmental readings by LGBT authors, underwriting the expense of such events, as well as presenting lecture- demonstrations and public panels featuring published LGBT authors and poets.

The wharenui building burned down accidentally in 2014. The reconstructed wharenui was rededicated in 2016. The photographs of the House Leaders that had been on display in the original wharenui were saved from the fire, but the original tukutuku panels were tragically lost.

The equivalent of summer hit in France is the tube de l'√©t√© (summer tube), an expression that exists since 1960s which became more commercially used by the late 1990s. Songs that are marketed to be summer hits are very common, and often feature an upbeat tempo and descriptions of things such as relaxation outdoors and beach parties. These are songs considered ideal listening during summer activities. These intentional summer hits are most common in country (particularly country pop) and mainstream popular music but are much less common in rock.

The role was portrayed by Florencia Lozano from January 27, 1997, to March 2, 2000, and briefly in 2002.T√©a Delgado profile - SoapCentral.com Lozano returned to the role once again on December 5, 2008,One Life to Live recap (12/5/08) - Soaps.com Retrieved on January 9, 2009. and remained through the original television finale aired January 13, 2012. In April 2012, Lozano become the latest One Life to Live actress to join General Hospital with her alter ego. Scheduled to premiere in May, with Roger Howarth (Todd Manning) returning with her, she premiered on the series on May 9, 2012, last appearing December 3, 2012. Lozano reprised the role when daily episodes of One Life to Live debuted on Hulu, iTunes, and FX Canada via The Online Network April 29, 2013. T√©a was conceived as a character with a stern but passionate personality. She became one of the show's most popular characters and part of one of soap opera's most popular romances for her complex and volatile pairing with Todd Manning, a troubled and sometimes villainous character on the series. Soaps In Depth stated that T√©a \\"set the small screen ablaze\\" during her time on One Life to Live. Background=Character creation and portrayal= T√©a Delgado was designed as the \\"tough-talking, yet soft-hearted attorney\\" of the series. The writers gave her a fragile personality, layering her as someone capable of showing great love and who is also \\"dying to be loved herself\\". One moment, T√©a is seen as fiery and enraged; the next, she is witnessed as being soft-spoken and understanding. Having perfected these aspects of the character when paired with Roger Howarth's Todd Manning, actress Florencia Lozano acknowledged Howarth's help. \\"He's not an actor who's in his own world,\\" she said. Todd had been romantically involved with Blair Cramer for some time already, and his divorce from her and custody pursuit of his daughter, Starr, soon positioned Lozano's character as a new love interest for Todd. The pace of the soap opera was at times overwhelming for Lozano, and she looked for a way to manage this. \\"I try to keep feeding the fire, feeding some of the emotional stuff that T√©a had to go through,\\" she stated. \\"It's tiring because, on some level, I have to go there. I have to feel sad. I don't know any other way to do it.\\" Detailing what she thinks about in order to produce onscreen tears, a query she often received from fans, Lozano stated, \\"Well...things that would make me cry. It's hard sometimes, but also it feels good when I feel like I portrayed something honestly.\\" Having a good grasp on who T√©a is provided Lozano with enough room to \\"make things up\\" even while keeping her character true to form. In addition, she looked to make each scene unique. \\"That's the thing about acting,\\" she said. \\"When you're rehearsing over and over, how do you make it new every time? Well, it is new every time because it's the first time you've done it that time.\\" Lozano saw each take as an opportunity to improve, rather than as something to be annoyed by, commenting, \\"I love it when we screw up, because we get another chance to do it, and every time it's a different scene.\\" Lozano added, however, that she does enjoy perfecting her scenes. \\"It makes me really happy when I feel like I kicked ass in a scene,\\" she stated. Not every character action was originally in the script. \\"A lot of the times,\\" Lozano said, \\"someone [would] make me laugh, and then my next line [would] be about responding to that. Any number of things [could] happen, which are usually the best moments. I [wanted] to be open to that. But it's hard, too, because I [didn't] want to screw up my lines.\\" She further relayed, \\"There are many times when I think I didn't get a scene. When you don't feel anything, it's frustrating. I'm less hard on myself because I realize how difficult what we do is. But, as an actor, you hope that you go in there and get caught up in the moment. I think, self-indulgently, that's why we become actors in the first place -- to feel things.\\" =Todd and T√©a= Roger Howarth as Todd Manning and Florencia Lozano as T√©a Delgado. One Life to Live viewers originally resisted Todd being paired with anyone but Blair. Soap Opera Digest stated that T√©a not only did not have any history with Todd, \\"she was breaking up One Life to Live's most popular (if unorthodox) duo\\". The magazine added that it was Lozano's \\"consistently strong and convincing portrayal\\" of T√©a as the tough but soft attorney that won viewers over. Viewers saw immediate chemistry between Howarth and Lozano. Todd and T√©a's marriage is at first nothing more than a business deal; Todd offers T√©a to be his wife and lawyer for $5 million to ensure custody of his daughter (Starr). He is out for revenge against ex-wife Blair, feeling she ruined his chances at happiness when he returned to town after being presumed dead and discovered her having sex with Patrick Thornhart (Thorsten Kaye) on the floor of the penthouse he once shared with her. It is after this Todd shuts down emotionally, almost completely. He subsequently only shows kindness to his daughter and his sister (Victoria Lord), and occasionally to children. Soaps In Depth stated, \\"T√©a being Todd's wife often put her in conflict with wife No. 1 and No. 2 -- Blair.\\" During one heated confrontation, the women's argument becomes physical. Lozano said \\"I'll never forget the time I crashed out the window. Kassie DePaiva (Blair) had to push me, and she was so nervous about really hurting me that I actually had to calm her down.\\" With T√©a in his life, the writers had the emotional walls Todd had built around himself slowly collapse. As Soaps In Depth described it, T√©a is the one who made Todd's heart \\"grow at least two sizes bigger\\". While Todd's tough bravado and insensitivity are lessened in T√©a's presence, his reluctance to be sexually intimate becomes a prominent obstacle for the couple. After having felt betrayed by Blair with Patrick, Todd not only has trouble letting another woman into his psyche but also into his bed. This factor often causes T√©a to be sexually frustrated while near Todd. Although they have agreed to keep their relationship platonic, she finds him sexually attractive and starts to desire him romantically. The writers often emphasized this, at one point having T√©a strip down naked in front of Todd and plead for him to have sex with her, to which Todd painfully and angrily throws her out of their penthouse into the cold. He explains his reaction as being more about not being ready than actually rejecting T√©a. Todd and T√©a's romance was written as tempestuous, star- crossed, loving, and abusive. The pairing would go from almost having sex one minute, to verbally abusing each other the next. Physical abuse takes place in one instance when Todd is on the run from the police and proceeds to kidnap T√©a; he punches her out when she implies he will rape her as he had done to Marty Saybrooke (Susan Haskell) years earlier; T√©a later knocks Todd out with a shovel to escape. However, during these scenes, the characters' love for each other continues to show; Todd releases a mournful, monstrous scream after having knocked T√©a unconscious and relaxing her body on a chair in front of him, and T√©a is seen to seemingly sexually desire Todd even while having tied him up after her attack on him. A disappointed T√©a calls Todd a rapist after his kidnapping of her, which is a breaking point for Todd. She is one of the few people to believe that there is good in him. When she gives indication she now sees him as his enemies do, it is as much a slight to Todd's well-being as anything physical. \\"T√©a called Todd a rapist,\\" Lozano said. \\"By saying out loud that he's a rapist, it was the only way she could push him away. She needed those weapons, both verbal and emotional, to cut the tie because it had been so strong.\\" When working alongside Howarth, Lozano never felt as though she was simply reciting lines. She said, \\"I feel like we're just talking, listening and responding to each other. And that makes it relatively easy to concentrate. I feel like we're connecting.\\" She called on her imagination, adding, \\"I do a lot of substituting. I think, 'What if Todd were a real person in my life?' The situations are so dramatic that in some ways it's easy to feel worked up.\\" Further differentiating Todd and T√©a from other couples on the series was the application of theme music. Dark, sad but romantic theme music was applied to the pairing. Composer David Nichtern explained the emotion he wanted to convey. \\"This was kind of as close as we get to Todd 'romantic' music,\\" he said. \\"It's still dark and mysterious, but has the possibility of a little sensuality and romance. I worked on these cues with my pal Kevin Bents (who does a lot of the keyboard work on the show) but when it came time for the demented variations, I just had to be alone (just kidding).\\"In 1998, David Nichtern gave an exclusive interview via e-mail regarding his music compositions for One Life to Live. Although Todd never expects to fall in love with T√©a, he does. The marriage of convenience takes the characters on unexpected turns, both with intense feelings for each other. However, Todd struggles with his feelings for her based on his own troubled past and childhood. His obsession with destroying the Buchanan family (his sworn enemies, with the exception of a few) becomes too much for T√©a to take. With T√©a ready to divorce him, Todd soon \\"develops\\" split personalities in order to keep T√©a in his life and get out of going to prison for holding 14 people hostage (the day he also kidnapped her). T√©a begins to fall in love with Todd's perceived good alters. The writers had the couple divorce as part of Todd's defense strategy, but remarry after he was cleared of kidnapping charges. More heartbreak follows once T√©a discovers he is faking his split personality disorder. Though the couple again reunite in 2000 and in 2002, they never manage to stay together for long. T√©a returns to town in 2008, with the fact they share a daughter named Danielle. While characters on the series have struggled to understand T√©a's love for Todd, the writers made the pairing's love story detailed enough in its complexity for viewers to comprehend. Storylines=1997‚Äì99= When lawyer T√©a Delgado (Lozano) first sets foot in Llanview as one of its feistiest lawyers, it is because Carlotta Vega (Patricia Mauceri) has asked her to help defend Antonio Vega (Kamar de los Reyes). Antonio -- Carlotta's son -- has been charged with the murder of Carlo Hesser (Thom Christopher). Carlotta is naturally set on saving her son from prison. T√©a helps clear Antonio of charges, meanwhile engaging in an intimate relationship with Kevin Buchanan (then portrayed by Kevin Stapleton, later Timothy Gibbs). She soon sets out to gain a job alongside Nora Buchanan (Hillary B. Smith). Nora declines to hire T√©a. T√©a, however, is determined to show Nora her law skills, even going so far as to seek to have Antonio's previous murder conviction be overturned. T√©a succeeds in her goal of overturning Antonio's murder conviction. It is not long before Todd Manning (Howarth) notices her, seeing the asset in having her work for him. He hires T√©a to defend Alex Olanov (Tonja Walker), and T√©a is able to get Alex off without any prison time. Todd is further intrigued by T√©a, just as T√©a's romantic relationship with Kevin is about to end. Subsequently, she moves into an apartment with Rachel Gannon (then portrayed by Sandra P. Grant). Blair Cramer (DePaiva), Todd's ex-wife, is injured in a car accident. While in rehab, she finds out it was Todd who set the explosion that blew up the Armitage yacht, killing Guy Armitage. The news triggers a stroke. She eventually falls into a coma. After being told by Blair's doctors she will not awaken from the coma, Todd takes action. Anxious to make sure his ex-wife's aunt, Dorian Lord (Robin Strasser), will not win custody of his daughter Starr (Kristen Alderson), Todd offers T√©a five million dollars to marry him and to be his lawyer in the custody battle. T√©a is flabbergasted; she never had much money. She agrees to the deal. While Blair is comatose, T√©a gets full custody of Starr for Todd. Months of emotional closeness follow for Todd and T√©a, and T√©a realizes she has developed romantic feelings for Todd. Todd, however, keeps T√©a emotionally at a distance after realizing he, too, is harboring romantic feelings for her. T√©a turns to Andrew Carpenter (Wortham Krimmer) for comfort and for the type of intimacy Todd will not give her. She had tried to seduce Todd into having sex with her, but he violently threw her out. T√©a, though, quickly reasons she cannot have sex with Andrew because she is in love with Todd. Despite T√©a's feelings for Todd, she asks Todd for a divorce. Todd refuses the divorce and is able to get T√©a to agree to a four-week trial reconciliation. Todd finally proposes to T√©a. She happily accepts. Their happiness, however, is brief. Todd soon becomes a suspect in the murder of a woman named Georgie Phillips. He panics, and holds everyone suspected of killing Georgie (even ones not so suspected, such as his own sister, Viki) hostage at the Buchanan Lodge to get the murderer to confess. Rachel finally confesses to Georgie's murder. Todd runs off, trying to elude the police looking to arrest him. T√©a follows Todd. She hopes she can reason with him, but he grabs her and forces her to come with him against her will. He takes her to the garden shed at Llanfair. When T√©a verbally lashes out at Todd and mentions his rape of Marty Saybrooke (Haskell), Todd temporarily loses control of his temper and hits T√©a. He then ties her up. The two continue to banter when she awakens, even sharing a brief kiss. T√©a uses Todd's desire and love for her to trick him into untying her from the ropes binding her arms and legs. She knocks Todd out with a shovel, and later has him arrested. Todd escapes soon after being locked in a jail cell. He seeks out his daughter to say goodbye to her, and corners T√©a in a cabana. There, the two discuss Todd's inability to have sex with her. When Todd tries to initiate sex with her in response to this, T√©a rejects him, saying it is too late. He should have trusted her more with his heart and his body. Todd becomes loud. The cops overhear, immediately encircling the building. Sam Rappaport (Kale Browne), Todd's former mentor and longtime father-figure, goes in to talk to Todd. He learns Todd was raped at age 14 by adoptive father Peter Manning. When Sam tries to introduce that fact in court, Todd collapses and goes into a catatonic state. When he awakens, he appears to have dissociative identity disorder (split personalities), like his sister Viki Lord (Erika Slezak). The personality called Tom, a more childlike and gentle personality, is in control and is determined to have T√©a give him a second chance. She eventually admits she is still in love with Todd. More personalities show themselves later. A split personality named Pete is seen as being responsible for all of Todd's cruelest misdeeds. After an apparent \\"integration\\" of Todd's newfound \\"alters\\", Todd and T√©a soon marry again. At the reception, Starr unknowingly has a tape played over the country club's loud speakers where Todd is heard confessing he has been faking the DID to avoid criminal prosecution. This happens as Todd and T√©a are in the process of making love. T√©a is naturally furious with Todd and leaves him to face off with Sam and Viki. Todd soon after kidnaps T√©a and traps her in their cabana room. She says that he was supposed to truly love her. Todd says he does love her, but he cannot change. T√©a tells him to get out of her life. He leaves. The room is set on fire, however, when T√©a throws an object at one of the lit candles in the room. She tries to escape, but the door is jammed. T√©a almost dies; Todd, with Sam at his side, is able to save her. Todd prepares to leave town, but not before trying to convince T√©a to come with him by leaving a letter for her in which somewhat expresses his feelings. T√©a tears up the letter, refusing to return to Todd. Once back at Todd's empty penthouse on a mission to rid it of all of her belongings, her emotions get the best of her. She breaks down in memory of her past with Todd. Before Todd leaves, Sam asks Todd if he was truly raped as a young teenager. Todd's answer is ambiguous. The two share an emotional goodbye. Later in 1999, T√©a files for divorce. =2000, 2002= In February 2000, Todd reappears in Llanview intent on taking T√©a away with him. He visits with his daughter and gives her a note for T√©a. T√©a is reluctant to meet with Todd, but she does, at Viki's cabin. When he informs her he caused a gas leak, played mind games on the people of Llanview, and he was the one who had recently shot a gun at R.J. Gannon (Timothy D. Stickney), T√©a's new boyfriend, due to his jealousy, all while having secretly watched her for months, T√©a is beyond appalled. It is not until Todd tells her he had \\"been all over the world\\" trying to erase her from his mind and he could not, that she begins to understand his train of thought; it was his way of showing how deep his love runs for her. Having made his devotion known to her by telling her that he would make the world end for her, Todd brushes off the notion of typical love. He begs T√©a to leave town with him, and although frustrated that Todd refuses to take this time to make love to her, T√©a finally takes Todd's hand and leaves with him to start a new life. In June 2000, Todd returns to Llanview, stating T√©a left him. He soon seeks to once again start a romantic life with Blair. After much manipulation, he does. The two continue to have their ups and downs, though. T√©a returns to town in 2002 for a brief visit. When she visits Todd, it is evident he is still hurt by her having left him. However, Todd has bigger problems. Blair is furious with him for his latest misdeeds, and has hired bodyguards to keep him away from their children. She and Sam secretly take the family away to Hawaii to get away from Todd, but the bodyguards are working for Todd. He follows them to Hawaii and plans to kidnap the kids. He runs into T√©a there. T√©a warns Blair about Todd's plans. Blair is able to bring Starr and Jack safely back to Llanview. Todd and T√©a, meanwhile, are shipwrecked on a deserted island due to Todd's plan to kidnap his children having gone awry. They are not alone. Ross Rayburn, a man Todd had hired to help him with the kidnapping, is also stuck on the island with them, resulting in a love triangle as he and Todd vy for T√©a's affections. Todd spies T√©a kissing Ross and decides to leave the island alone. As he prepares for his voyage, T√©a shows up and tells Todd she is in love with him and \\"it\\" has always been him for her. A wave of emotions come over Todd, and he tells T√©a he wants to be with her, too. The two soon have sex for the first time, but a change in the weather threatens to ruin the couple's newfound happiness. During this time, T√©a painfully realizes Todd is still in love with Blair when she sees he has kept a picture of her, though having earlier sworn he was through with that part of his life. Though hurt by this realization, T√©a gives her blessing for Todd to romantically reunite with Blair. Desperate to get home to his family, Todd risks his life by getting on a makeshift raft and rowing out into the sea. He washes up on a beach in Guam, and from there makes his way back to Llanview. T√©a and Ross are later rescued. =2008‚Äì12= T√©a returns on December 5, 2008, to visit Todd (then portrayed by Trevor St. John), who is incarcerated due to imprisoning an amnesiac Marty for months. T√©a begs him to let her help him, but he refuses. Todd eventually changes his mind, but T√©a has an ulterior motive for returning to Llanview. She seeks to prove her other client, Ray Montez, had been framed for the murder of his first wife by the real killer, his second wife Vanessa (the real killer later turns out to be Ray's daughter, Lola). T√©a goes head-to-head with Nora in court, forcing Marty to admit on the stand she had not been literally held against her will. All the charges are dropped, but a furious Starr announces to the court her father had planned to steal her baby after birth before she could give it up for adoption. With Starr and corrupt nurse Lee Halpern as witnesses, the case seems solid. However, T√©a plays upon Starr's worsening guilt over sending her own father to prison, and she changes her testimony. T√©a finds Todd standing over a murdered Lee in his own house; T√©a tells the police she killed Lee in self-defense. The police do not believe T√©a to be guilty of the murder. With all evidence lost, Todd is cleared. With the threat of prosecution removed, Todd finally confesses to Marty and Starr his crimes against them. At Llanview's Go Red Ball, Todd and T√©a get into a six-way altercation with John McBain, Blair, Marty, and a mysterious man named Wes Granger, who Marty has been staying with for the past few days. During the brawl, Wes pulls a knife on Todd. Later that night, Wes is found dead beside Marty, and she is accused. Although Marty is charged, it is also thought Todd may be the true killer. When Blair is found stabbed in her shower, Todd is arrested, as he was the first to find her. When T√©a has become sick of Todd supposedly involved in every crime that comes up and of feeling she currently ranks third in comparison to Todd's former lovers (Blair and Marty), she quits as his lawyer. T√©a accepts Dorian's offer to represent Blair, who has just awoken from a coma, in a custody battle against Todd. She comes up with the \\"ultimate plan\\" -- to get John to marry Blair to keep the kids away from Todd; the plan is successful in court. To get his kids back in turn, Todd comes up with a plan to seduce T√©a. Although she turns him down, Todd is successful in getting her to have sex with him weeks later. Afterward, Todd thinks this signifies T√©a's willingness to help him in his custody battle against Blair. T√©a, however, reveals she has just \\"played\\" him. The next day, Todd learns John has been arrested, and heads to court to use this to win custody of his kids. T√©a stalls Todd with a kiss and tells him she is just trying to keep him from getting to the judge. They have sex in the empty courtroom. Marty walks in afterward. T√©a is upset when Todd runs after Marty, so she uses R.J. to make Todd jealous. It works. She and Todd end up sleeping together after T√©a's date with R.J., and again on the morning of Todd and Blair's custody trial. In May 2009, Powell Lord turns out to be the serial killer suspected of most of the recent town murders and Blair's stabbing. He and Rebecca Lewis, kidnap Todd, Blair and T√©a. In a boiler room of the chosen kidnapping site, Blair and T√©a believe they will die. Due to this, they reveal to each other Todd is the love of both their lives. T√©a has an even deeper secret to tell Blair, but is not able to when Blair passes out. They later survive the kidnapping. Todd and T√©a become especially close. In August, Blair suspects T√©a is hiding something and hires Rex Balsom to investigate the time T√©a was absent from Llanview. It is discovered she is married to Ross Rayburn. Ross seems to give T√©a a divorce. Todd proposes marriage to T√©a; T√©a accepts, and they wed in October. She tells Todd how much she loves him as well and she never wants to lose him. Todd and T√©a have a honeymoon night while Blair contemplates how to reveal to Todd his marriage to T√©a is invalid. Todd does not believe her at first, but does after making calls. When Todd confronts T√©a about it, he feels their relationship is over. As T√©a suggests Ross and Blair must have somehow schemed to keep the divorce papers from being signed and she can sign them now and for Todd to give her another chance, Todd tells her no and it no longer matters. He screams he fell in love with and became a better person for her but he now believes she is more \\"rot\\" than he is. T√©a leaves heartbroken and sets off to confront Blair. Blair and T√©a argue over the matter. Blair wonders what T√©a is truly hiding. T√©a admits she has been hiding the fact she has a child; guessing Todd is the father, Blair tries to force T√©a to tell him, but T√©a accidentally pushes Blair out of her bedroom window. T√©a reveals to Rachel she and Todd share a daughter named Daniella and she only found out recently with a DNA test. T√©a, aboard a plane to London to meet up with her daughter, tells Eli Clarke her daughter is Todd's and not Ross's. Eventually, Todd learns of Danielle's existence and desires to be a part of her life. However, after witnessing Todd shoot Ross, Danielle wants nothing to do with him. For the sake of her daughter, T√©a ends her romance with Todd, but tries to push her daughter and Todd to have some kind of relationship. T√©a is diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumor, after collapsing in court. She conceals her condition from Danielle. She goes to court to get Todd off, for the charge of pushing a pregnant Marty down a flight of stairs and causing her to miscarry, so Todd can care for Danielle after she dies. Blair learns of T√©a's condition and places their differences aside to be by T√©a's side. Subsequently, Blair convinces T√©a to seek medical treatment for her tumor, which T√©a initially protests, but eventually gives in. Shortly thereafter, Blair takes T√©a to her first radiation treatment. Blair promises to make sure Danielle is a part of her family, once T√©a dies, and she comforts T√©a. Weeks later, T√©a calls Blair over to ask Blair to be Danielle's legal guardian in case something happens to Todd; Blair promises to always be there for Danielle. Blair and T√©a share a goodbye with a montage of some of their history together. When Todd and Danielle learned of her condition, and upon learning it was fatal, they protested T√©a is not trying to save herself. With the limited time they believe they have left, T√©a and Todd remarry for a fourth time. The next day, T√©a tells Todd and Danielle she has checked herself into a hospice. She asks Blair to be a mom to Danielle. Days later, T√©a arrives at the hospice St. Kitts and is looked after by Dr. Greg Evans and Shaun Evans. T√©a supposedly dies on August 27, 2010. Todd and Dani fly over to St. Kitts to see T√©a once more, but, once they arrive, they are told by Greg that T√©a had died the night before. Todd and Dani return home to Llanview and go through her belongings. Dani's friends and Todd's family pay their respects to T√©a. Later, Todd receives a vase in the mail from St. Kitts with T√©a's ashes inside it. T√©a was later seen alive in a hospital room and Dr. Greg Evans attempts to tell T√©a she is okay, but is stopped by Eli Clarke. When T√©a wakes from her coma, Greg tells her she is not dying. T√©a escapes from the clinic only to be kidnapped by Eli. T√©a is shocked to learn Eli has also kidnapped Starr, Hope, and Dani. Starr and Hope escape. The police arrive to save T√©a and Dani, but Eli causes an explosion in the warehouse; T√©a and Dani survive and are reunited with Todd. In August 2011, it was revealed the man T√©a was married to was actually Todd's twin brother Victor Lord Jr. and the real Todd Manning had been imprisoned for the last eight years. When the truth is revealed, T√©a assures Victor he is the man she loves even though he is not really Todd Manning. The two have sex. Victor is shot by an unknown assailant and later dies in T√©a's arms. T√©a believes Todd when he said he did not kill Victor and defends him, Starr and her brother, Tom√°s. T√©a gets Todd and Starr off and they are only sentenced to community service. In October, T√©a thinks she might be pregnant with Victor's baby; a pregnancy test further confirms that T√©a is indeed pregnant. On January 13, 2012, it is revealed that T√©a's husband Victor Lord Jr. is alive and is secretly being held captive by Allison Perkins. In May 2012, a heavily pregnant T√©a arrives in Port Charles, the setting of General Hospital, to provide legal counsel to Starr, who had held mobster Sonny Corinthos at gun point. T√©a quickly discloses that she was hired by Blair. On June 1, she collapses in the parking garage and is found by Todd, and goes into labor. Todd crashes their car off the road during a rainstorm and delivers T√©a's baby, a boy, in the rain. When the baby is born, he is not crying and Todd takes the baby and goes for help. Todd runs into Heather Webber, who in turn says the baby is unable to be saved. As Todd goes to tell T√©a the unfortunate news, he discovers Sam Morgan lying unconscious with her own healthy newborn son nearby. As Todd attempts to return Sam's baby to her, T√©a arrives and falsely assumes the baby is hers. Heather leaves T√©a's stillborn son in place of Sam's. Todd later returns T√©a to Llanview with Sam's baby. Heather Webber arrives in Llanview in September 2012 at T√©a's house, introducing herself as \\"Susan Moore.\\" She offers to be a nanny for the baby. T√©a is thankful and hires her. John later arrives in Llanview, and secretly takes a DNA sample from the baby after Sam's husband, Jason, begins to suspect that Sam's baby was switched with T√©a's. The DNA results are a match, and John goes to Llanview to tell T√©a the truth. However, before he can tell her, T√©a realizes that the baby and her nanny are gone. When John tells her that \\"Susan\\" is really Heather, a mental patient who escaped from Ferncliff, T√©a is shocked. When T√©a finds out that Heather is in Port Charles, she heads to Todd's house. Todd pretends to get a phone call from his P.I. telling him where Heather is, and he and T√©a leave to go find her. When they get there, however, they find John there with Port Charles Commissioner Anna Devane. T√©a listens as John and Anna punch holes in Todd's story, but is too worried about \\"her baby\\". Anna gets a phone call that Heather is at General Hospital, holding the baby hostage on the roof. John, Anna, Todd, and T√©a all head to General Hospital. T√©a wants to go be with \\"her son\\", but John stops her. Todd stays with T√©a, while John and Anna confer about the situation. T√©a overhears them saying Sam and Jason are on the roof with Heather, and wonders why they are on the roof with Heather and \\"her son\\". T√©a tries to go to the roof, but Todd stops her. T√©a watches in horror as Heather jumps from the roof with the baby in her arms. However, Jason manages to save the baby. T√©a is relieved, and anxious to see her son, but is confused when Todd and Anna keep stopping her. Eventually, she runs inside, and Todd chases after her. She gets out of the elevator, and sees John with Jason, Sam, and the baby. When she goes to get him, John and Sam hold her back, and she becomes even more confused. When Sam and Jason walk away with the baby, T√©a is furious and demands an explanation. John and Todd explains to her that her baby died and the child with Sam and Jason is Sam's son. At first, T√©a is in disbelief, thinking they're lying to her, but when John shows the DNA test that was run and tells her that the baby who died had hemophilia, a condition that's in T√©a's family, T√©a finally realizes her baby is dead. She goes to baby \\"Victor's\\" room, and tells Jason and Sam she will not take the baby away ‚Äì she just wants to say goodbye. Sam agrees, and T√©a says a heartfelt goodbye to \\"Victor\\". Afterwards, she leaves the room, and the hospital, in tears. T√©a comes to the police station after Todd is arrested in connection to the baby switch. T√©a asks him flat out if he had anything to do with the switch. Todd denies it, but T√©a warns him that if he did do this, he has hurt her more than he could ever have. She goes back to Llanview, but not before telling Starr about the suspicion surrounding Todd. T√©a is shown in Llanview again with Blair, when Todd arrives with Carly Corinthos and Skye Quartermaine. Carly and Skye claim that Tom√°s is actually an international arms dealer named Lorenzo Alcazar. Blair calls Tom√°s to come home, but a CIA agent shows up, saying Tom√°s has left for another mission. T√©a leaves with Blair and Skye to find Tom√°s. =2013= T√©a is still mourning the loss of her son and finding it hard to focus on life. However, that evening, while attending the opening of Blair's new nightclub Shelter, Dani passes out and has to be taken to the hospital by Todd, Blair, and T√©a. There, T√©a finds out that Dani has been taking Oxycontin pills, which caused her to have an overdose at the club. T√©a finds out Matthew knew, and she yells at him for not telling her. However, Todd yells at her for not realizing Dani was using. As T√©a is arguing with him, Victor comes in and pushes Todd away from T√©a. T√©a reunites with Victor. When Dani comes home later, she makes it clear that she feels like T√©a has just been ignoring her. Victor finds the nursery, and T√©a tells him about their baby and the switch. When Dani comes home after partying late at Shelter, T√©a is furious, but Dani says she was not using. T√©a makes it clear to Dani that she is going to be paying more attention to her. Reception T√©a became one of One Life to Live's most popular characters. Her romantic pairing with Todd was described as \\"one of the hottest stories to hit daytime television\\". Fans enjoyed the union and dubbed them \\"TnT\\" (for Todd and T√©a). The pairing's popularity was seen as equal to rival couple Todd and Blair. This created an intense rivalry between the two fanbases, which became known as the \\"T&B; vs. TnT\\" wars, and were some of the genre's most notorious Internet battles. They left writers and producers with the task of deciding which couple would be the \\"true love\\" couple. In addition, viewers enjoyed the battles between Blair and T√©a, which became one of soap opera's most entertaining rivalries. Although Todd and T√©a were promoted as a dysfunctional pairing, they were prominently featured in commercials advertising their love story,\\"Todd Needs a Wife...\\", One Life to Live, Week of 07.07.97\\"She Knows What She Wants...\\", One Life to Live, Week of 12.15.97\\"Dial 'D' for Danger\\", One Life to Live, Week of 03.28.98Featured Couple of the Week: Todd and T√©a, One Life to Live, Week of 11.16.98 voted \\"Best Couple\\" and \\"Best Romance\\" in soap opera magazines, and cited as \\"television at its best\\". Howarth left the role of Todd in 1998. When he later returned as the character in 2000 for a one-week stint to persuade T√©a to leave with him, it was one of the show's most anticipated events. He returned again as Todd later that year without T√©a. When the return was first reported, fans queried whether T√©a would be returning with the character. An emphatic \\"No!\\" was issued by Lozano's agent in what was deemed \\"an angry statement\\" to magazine Soaps in Depth. The agent added, \\"Give it up, guys! Stop calling!\\" Viewers wondered how the show would explain T√©a no longer being with Todd, and heavily campaigned for the series to reunite the pairing. The writers had Todd explain that T√©a had left him in the middle of the night, with a letter saying that she could no longer be with him. Determined not to be alone, Todd is soon seen going after Blair, wanting the family he once had with her. This did not deter fans of the Todd and T√©a romance from campaigning for the couple. In 2002, their campaign was successful when Lozano agreed to return to the series for a brief stint. The opportunity to work with Howarth again was one of the reasons Lozano decided to return. \\"It's a lot of fun to work opposite Roger,\\" she said. \\"There is so much going on beneath the surface.\\" The writers scripted Todd and T√©a's reunion to take place following Blair, betrayed by Todd again, having left him; it was a live-week for the series, something that had not been done in almost twenty years in the history of soap opera. Soaps In Depth stated that with a shout-out to fans, T√©a made her return entrance by stating, \\"I'm baaack!\\" with \\"a gleam in her eye\\" while interrupting Antonio and Carlotta Vega's bilingual bickering before visiting Todd. Not long after visiting Todd, the two are shipwrecked with one of Todd's employees after coming face to face for the first time in two years on a boat Todd had planned to use in order to kidnap his children from Blair. Regarding Todd and T√©a being stranded together on a deserted island, former head writer Gary Tomlin, who was new to the series at the time, explained, \\"They both realize the mistakes they've made. T√©a starts to see why she fell in love with him. The same thing for him. He's thinking that if they ever get off this island, they can go back and he can share his life with her -- a life including his kids.\\" While Todd does not declare his love for T√©a, he \\"opens up\\" to T√©a in \\"his own special way\\". Tomlin elaborated, \\"He makes the decision not to run away and deal with what he needs to deal with. [Todd and T√©a were cast away in the first place because] we wanted to address Todd's relationship with the past.\\" Tomlin further relayed, \\"It was also a way to finally satisfy Todd and T√©a fans, who have been campaigning for a reunion since Florencia Lozano left the show in 2000. I don't know if Todd and Blair could have stayed together. Had he stayed in Llanview, it's possible that T√©a would have come back, and we would have dealt with the situation in Llanview, with Blair being part of the dynamic.\\" Though Tomlin reunited Todd and T√©a, seemingly having the pair on the path to their happy ending and scripting their first time having sex together (a long-awaited event by fans of the love story), he chose Todd and Blair as being the actual \\"true love\\" couple. This decision angered Todd and T√©a fans, who expressed their anger through e-mails to the ABC network over Tomlin describing Todd's love for Blair as \\"the most genuine thing he has ever felt\\". Tomlin said that he had his reasons for telling the summer story the way he did and that the Todd and T√©a fans have \\"convenient memories\\". He added, \\"When I went back to screen the Todd/T√©a relationship -- which everybody had said was so wonderful, that it was so this and so that, and they were so much in love -- the thing that stuck out for me was when Todd punched T√©a in the face and knocked her out. As a female viewer, I would have trouble getting past that. When you delve into physical abuse...it's a tough thing.\\" Todd being recast in 2003 with actor Trevor St. John after Howarth's departure from the series did not stop speculation that One Life to Live still planned to continue the Todd and T√©a romance. In 2005, TV Guide reported the rumor, stating, \\"We recently came across an OLTL audition script for a scene between Todd and 'Lucia,' a woman who sounds a lot like his long-lost Latina legal eagle. So is a recast in the works? A show rep assures TVGuide.com that 'there are no plans to bring the character of T√©a back to OLTL.'\\" It was surmised that if true, \\"Todd and Blair fans everywhere [could] breathe a major sigh of relief\\".

It was developed by the German firm of Ehrhardt & Sehmer. It was a rigid-recoil, muzzle-loading mortar on a fixed base that used compressed air to propel the mortar bomb to the target. Each cylinder of compressed air lasted for fifteen shots. A notable advantage was that the mortar had no firing signature, unlike conventional mortars with smoke and muzzle flash. A batch of 25 mortars, 250 cylinders of compressed air and 10,000 complete bombs (i.e. with fuses) was ordered on 31 July 1915 for combat evaluation, but the manufacturer was unable to deliver the mortar bombs. They had to be manufactured by the Army itself. A slightly improved model was offered by Ehrhardt & Sehmer at the end of March 1916, but it was rejected because of the poor range of the ammunition and the difficulty in procuring it. Ten trench mortar platoons, each with two weapons, were formed and deployed in February 1916, mainly to the Russian theater. References * Ortner, M. Christian.

His specialty is fingerstyle arrangements of sung or strongly melodic pieces, ranging from the Irish genre, to hymns, gospel tunes and pop music. He has also composed instrumentals for guitar, and has published a book of Irish and Scottish instrumental music that he arranged for classical string trio (violin, viola and cello). That book is called Celtic Treasures for String Trio (Piney Ridge, 2005). He plays and arranges guitar music almost exclusively in the CGDGAD tuning. (That tuning, developed by English guitarist Dave Evans in the 1960s, is similar to a Hawaiian slack-key tuning [CGCGAD] called \\"C Ni'ihau\\" tuning.) Acoustic Guitar magazine (Oct. 2001, No. 106) called McMeen \\"the king of CGDGAD tuning\\". McMeen has also arranged many pieces of music in Dropped D tuning (DADGBE), and has written The Art of Dropped D Guitar, published by Mel Bay Publications, Inc. He is profiled in Marquis‚Äô Who‚Äôs Who in the World. McMeen practiced law as his primary vocation in New York City for many years, and was a partner in the New York City law firm of LeBoeuf, Lamb, Greene & MacRae, LLP for 21 years, until his retirement in 2000. After retirement from law, he has pursued music and Christian ministry work. Biography El McMeen was born in Lewistown, Pennsylvania in 1947, and moved with his family to Huntingdon, PA in 1960. Through freshman year in college, he played clarinet as a solo instrument, as well as in band and orchestra settings. He studied piano, and sang in choral groups. He attended public schools in Lewistown and Huntingdon, PA, before attending Mt. Hermon School (now called Northfield Mt. Hermon School), graduating in 1965. He graduated from Harvard College in 1969, and the University of Pennsylvania Law School in 1972, in each case with Honors. He was an Editor of the University of Pennsylvania Law Review. He has been married to the former Sheila Taenzler since 1971, and has three sons‚ÄîJonathan, Daniel and James‚Äîand a daughter, Mary. McMeen started learning guitar as a senior at Mt. Hermon. At first, he did not approach the guitar primarily as a solo instrument, but used it as accompaniment for his singing. Upon reapplying himself in the early 1980s to the instrument, he encountered what he saw as an incredible breadth of music that one could try to render on guitar. He found himself attracted to Irish and Scottish music, alternative tunings, and different approaches to rendering and arranging music. McMeen‚Äôs playing is characterized by melodic emphasis, economy and great beauty of sound. His natural voice-like phrasing and skill at ornamentation and improvisation create a musical flow that gives the listener the impression he is hearing the piece for the first time, each time it is played. His improvisational approach to pieces creates an atmosphere of warm and personal immediacy. Guitar Player Magazine referred to his music as \\"drop-dead gorgeous\\".

Date in the early 1990s, and first published \\"A New Database Design Principle\\" in the July 1994 issue of Database Programming and Design and reprinted several times. It is the second of the two principles of database design, which seek to prevent databases from being too complicated or redundant, the first principle being the principle of full normalization (POFN). Simply put, it says that no two relations in a relational database should be defined in such a way that they can represent the same facts. As with database normalization, POOD serves to eliminate uncontrolled storage redundancy and expressive ambiguity, especially useful for applying updates to virtual relations (e.g., view (database)). Although simple in concept, POOD is frequently misunderstood and the formal expression of POOD continues to be refined. The principle is a restatement of the requirement that a database is a minimum cover set of the relational algebra. The relational algebra allows data duplication in the relations that are the elements of the algebra. One of the efficiency requirements of a database is that there be no data duplication. This requirement is met by the minimum cover set of the relational algebra.  Sources  * Database Debunkings: The Principle of Orthogonal Design, Part I, by D. McGoveran and C. J.

Diamond Craters, the Diamond post office, and other features in the vicinity took their name from the ranch, established in the area by the pioneer settler Mace McCoy. A post office was established at Diamond in 1887. Another early settler, Minerva J. (Dolly) Kiger, is credited with applying the name of the ranch to the community in 1874. She also named Kiger Creek, which originates on Steens Mountain and enters Swamp Creek near Diamond, and she named two other nearby steams, Cucamonga Creek and McCoy Creek.

The company began with the now-defunct Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus then expanded into additional live events, including Disney On Ice, Monster Jam, AMA Supercross Championship, and Sesame Street Live. The company is family owned. History In 1967, Irvin Feld and his brother Israel and Roy M. Hofheinz offered to purchase the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus. Broadway producers Cy Feuer and Ernest H. Martin sued in December 1967 to stop the sale. Instead the purchase of the combined circuses from the Ringling and North families to the Feld group took place for $8 million. The company was taken public in 1969. Kenneth Feld joined the business in 1970 after finishing college. Mattel purchased the company in 1971 for $50 million in Mattel stock, while Feld continued managing the circus. After Walt Disney World opened near Orlando, Florida, in 1971, the circus company attempted to cash in on the resulting tourism surge by opening Circus World in nearby Haines City. Irvin & Kenneth Feld Productions in 1979 purchased from Chicago-based Bill Wirtz the Holiday on Ice and Ice Follies for $12 million. The company soon approached Disney about doing a Disney show on ice. By 1980, the company produced 10 circus and ice show TV specials. An investment was also made in Barnum, the Broadway musical. In 1981, Ken Feld started the Beyond Belief show at the New Frontier Hotel and Casino. The Felds bought the company back in 1982 for $22.8 million. By then the business included Holiday on Ice, Ice Follies, Walt Disney's World on Ice, and Beyond Belief Las Vegas nightclub act. Circus World was sold to Arizona developer James Monaghan in 1984. Ringlings' third touring company, Gold Unit, premiered on July 1, 1988, in Japan. In late 1988, Beyond Belief Las Vegas act went on an international tour. =Feld Entertainment= In , Irvin & Kenneth Feld Productions, Inc. changed its name to Feld Entertainment, Inc. In 2001, Ken Feld began gifting shares of Feld Entertainment to his three daughters Nicole, Alana and Juliette Feld. Nicole was hired into the family business in 2001 and became the first female producer of the Ringling Bros. Circus in 2004. Alana also signed on in 2003. Due to an accident in October 2003, the Siegfried & Roy show was closed. FE started producing Disney Live! shows in June 2004 with Winnie the Pooh in the United Kingdom. Alana produced the first Doodlebops Live! in 2006. In 2006, Nicole was a vice president in charge of the circus. The company sold its Vienna, Virginia headquarters in May 2006 to America's Capital Partners then leased it back until 2018. In 2007, Nicole and Alana were elevated to executive vice president of the company. The company signed a 10-year agreement with Disney Live Family Entertainment for Disney on Ice, Disney Live and other Disney productions in August 2008. In September, Feld also acquired the motorsports division of Live Nation, including the properties of Monster Jam (and several associated monster trucks), Supercross, Arenacross, and the IHRA. The motor sport division was renamed Feld Entertainment Motor Sports. Feld Motor Sports launched its first new arena- based freestyle motocross touring production, Nuclear Cowboyz, in 2010. Feld Motor Sports sold the IHRA to IRG Sports + Entertainment in 2012. Feld Entertainment and Zignia Live, management company of Arena Cuidad de Mexico and Arena Monterrey, signed a promotion agreement in April 2011 bringing any of Feld shows to Zingia's managed arenas for a total of 18 weeks. This brings back the Ringling Bros circus in May 2012 that had been absent from Mexico since 2002. In January 2012, the company purchased Palmetto Corporate Center, a former Siemens Corp. complex in Ellenton, Florida, and plans to move most of its various operations and its world headquarters there over a five-year period starting with its worldwide production center. Feld agreed in October 2013 to occupy a to be built 241,457-square-foot warehouse in the Baltimore- Washington Industrial Park, Jessup, Maryland expected to be finished in November 2014 to consolidated two other warehouse elsewhere in the industrial park used for merchandise. In 2015, Feld Motor Sports HQ moved from Illinois to Ellenton. In March 2013, Feld agreed with Marvel Entertainment, which was acquired by The Walt Disney Company in 2009, to produce Marvel Universe Live!, a Marvel character-based live arena show. Marketing campaign company Cimarron Group was hired in 2013 by Feld Entertainment for all media campaign for Marvel Live and other Feld shows. The Cimarron Group however shut down August 2013. Juliette Feld was promoted to chief operating officer of the corporation in February 2016. In November 2016, Feld Entertainment and Sesame Workshop announced an agreement for a new Sesame Street Live show to debut in October 2017 to replace one by VStar Entertainment Group ending in July 2017. Citing low attendance rates, Feld Entertainment announced the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus would close after their final performance on May 21, 2017. The retirement of the elephants was a factor in the decreased attendance, but the company would continue operating its Center for Elephant Conservation. Feld Entertainment entered into the amusement and attractions industry again. Feld and Universal Brand Development has agreed to develop multiple properties into mobile pop-up attractions in April 2018. The first being DreamWorks Trolls: The Experience starting its tour in the third quarter 2018 in New York.

History The Oregon Lumber Company built a sawmill at Dee in 1906 and named it for Thomas Duncombe Dee, a stockholder and business associate of board member David Eccles. Dee was also a station on the Eccles- owned Mount Hood Railroad. In addition to the large sawmill, Dee had a privately owned water works and electric lighting system, as well as a general store, shops, and a hotel. Dee had a population of 250 in 1915; 200 in 1919, and by 1940 the population had declined to 100. Dee was sold to the Edward Hines Lumber Company in 1958 and they dismantled the town. Besides logging, Dee's economy is also tied to the fruit-growing industry of the Hood River Valley. The area was one of the primary communities in the Hood River Valley farmed by Nikkei‚ÄîJapanese migrants and their descendants. The first Japanese in the area were hired as laborers on the Mount Hood Railroad. They also worked at the mill and lived in the company housing on both sides of the East Fork Hood River, which passes through the town. About 35 Nikkei families lived in Dee in the 1920s and they founded the Dee Japanese Community Hall. Geography The area's fruit orchards lie between the east and west forks of the Hood River in an area known as Dee Flat.

Structurally, they can be divided into three different types of operations: the so-called 'people's war', 'partisan warfare', and 'raiding warfare'. Each had distinct characteristics that were common practice during the Civil War (1861‚Äì1865). Types The concept of a 'people's war,' first described by Clausewitz in his classic treatise On War, was the closest example of a mass guerrilla movement in the 19th century. In general during the American Civil War, this type of irregular warfare was conducted in the hinterland of the border states (Missouri, Arkansas, Tennessee, Kentucky, and northwestern Virginia / West Virginia). It was marked by a vicious quality of neighbors fighting each other as other grudges got settled. It was frequent for residents of one part of a single county to take up arms against their counterparts in the rest of the vicinity. Bushwhacking, murder, assault, and terrorism were characteristics of this kind of fighting. Few participants wore uniforms or were formally mustered into the actual armies. In many cases, civilian fought against civilians or civilians fought against opposing enemy troops. One such example was the opposing irregular forces operating in Missouri and northern Arkansas from 1862 to 1865, most of which were pro-Confederate or pro-Union in name only. They preyed on civilians and isolated military forces of both sides with little regard for politics. From the semiorganized guerrillas, several groups formed and were given some measure of legitimacy by their governments. Quantrill's Raiders, who terrorized pro-Union civilians and fought Federal troops in large areas of Missouri and Kansas, was one such unit. Another notorious unit, with debatable ties to the Confederate military, was led by Champ Ferguson along the Kentucky-Tennessee border, who became one of the few figures of the Confederate cause to be executed after the war. Dozens of other small, localized bands terrorized the countryside throughout the border region during the war, bringing total war to the area that lasted until the end of the Civil War and, in some areas, beyond. Partisan warfare, in contrast, more closely resembled commando operations of the 20th century. Partisans were small units of conventional forces, controlled and organized by a military force for operations behind enemy lines. The 1862 Partisan Ranger Act, passed by the Confederate Congress, authorized the formation of such units and gave them legitimacy, which placed them in a different category from the common 'bushwhacker' or 'guerrilla'. John Singleton Mosby formed a partisan unit that was very effective in tying down Union forces behind their lines in northern Virginia in the last two years of the war. Groups such as Blazer's Scouts, White's Comanches, the Loudoun Rangers, McNeill's Rangers, and other similar forces at times served in the formal armies, but they often were loosely organized and operated more as partisans than as cavalry, especially early in the war. Morgan's Raiders enter Washington, OhioLastly, deep raids by conventional cavalry forces were often considered 'irregular' in nature. The \\"Partisan Brigades\\" of Nathan Bedford Forrest and John Hunt Morgan operated as part of the cavalry forces of the Confederate Army of Tennessee in 1862 and 1863. They were given specific missions to destroy logistical hubs, railroad bridges, and other strategic targets to support the greater mission of the Army of Tennessee. Morgan led raids into Kentucky as well. In his last raid, he violated orders by going across the Ohio River and raiding in Ohio and Indiana as well since he wanted to bring the war to the North. The long raid diverted thousands of Union troops. Morgan captured and paroled nearly 6,000 troops, destroyed bridges and fortifications, and ran off livestock. By mid-1863, Morgan's Raiders had been mostly destroyed in the late days of the Great Raid of 1863. Some of his followers continued under their own direction, such as Marcellus Jerome Clarke, who kept on with raids in Kentucky. The Confederacy conducted few deep cavalry raids in the latter years of the war, mostly because of the losses in experienced horsemen and the offensive operations of the Union Army. Federal cavalry conducted several successful raids during the war but in general used their cavalry forces in a more conventional role. A good exception was the 1863 Grierson's Raid, which did much to set the stage for General Ulysses Grant's victory during the Vicksburg Campaign. Union countermeasures Federal counterguerrilla operations were successful in reducing the impact of Confederate guerrilla warfare. In Arkansas, Union forces used a wide variety of strategies to defeat irregulars. They included the use of Arkansas Unionist forces as anti-guerrilla troops, the use of riverine forces such as gunboats to control the waterways, and the provost marshal's military law enforcement system to spy on suspected guerrillas and to imprison those who were captured. Against Confederate raiders, the Union army developed an effective cavalry itself and reinforced that system by numerous blockhouses and fortification to defend strategic targets. However, Union attempts to defeat Mosby's Partisan Rangers fell short of success because of Mosby's use of very small units (10‚Äì15 men) that operated in areas that were considered to be friendly to the Confederates. Another regiment, known as the \\"Thomas Legion,\\" had white and anti-Union Cherokee Indians, morphed into a guerrilla force and continued fighting in the remote mountain back-country of western North Carolina for a month after Robert E. Lee's surrender at Appomattox Court House. That unit was never completely suppressed by Union forces, but it voluntarily ceased hostilities after capturing the town of Waynesville, North Carolina, on May 10, 1865. Postwar guerrilla action In the late 20th century, several historians focused on the Confederate government's decision to not use guerrilla warfare to prolong the war. Near the end of the war, some in the Confederate administration who advocated continuing the fight as a guerrilla conflict. Such efforts were opposed by Confederate generals such as Lee, who ultimately believed that surrender and reconciliation were the best options for the war- ravaged South.

It is about five miles south of the city of Hood River and has a Hood River ZIP code. History Pine Grove was a station on the Mount Hood Railroad and was named for a stand of timber that once existed at this locale. In 1886, German immigrant Peter Mohr planted 400 apple trees in the Pine Grove area, in what was probably the first commercial orchard in the Hood River Valley planted on dry land and relying solely on irrigation. Pine Grove was also one of the primary communities in the Hood River Valley farmed by Nikkei‚ÄîJapanese migrants and their descendants. Economy Like much of Hood River County, the economy of Pine Grove is based on agriculture, especially fruit orchards and the accompanying storage and packing facilities. Businesses in the Pine Grove area include The Fruit Company, which packs and ships fruit gift baskets and gourmet food products, and Mount Hood Winery. Mount Hood Winery's cooperative winemaking facility is located in a former fruit-packing warehouse. Also located in Pine Grove is Columbia Gorge Fruit Growers, a non- profit organization of 400 growers and 20 shippers of tree fruit in the Mid- Columbia area that works to encourage and promote the fruit industry. To preserve the history of the area's principal industry, in 2012 The Fruit Foundation Historical Society will be opening the Fruit Heritage Museum in Pine Grove in a historic cold storage and fruit packing facility built in the 1930s and now owned by the Fruit Company. Historic structures Pine Grove Grange celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2006. It is the oldest Grange in Hood River County. The current Grange hall originally served as a general store and the upstairs was a community dance hall. Today the Hood River Valley Playhouse uses the upstairs stage for its productions. Pine Grove Methodist Church was dedicated in 1907 and still serves the community today. The Martin and Carrie Hill House near Pine Grove is a 1910 Dutch Colonial Revival house on a working farm listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Education Pine Grove Elementary School is part of the Hood River County School District. The current school was built in 1927 and has the original cast iron school bell in the cupola. The first school on the current school grounds was built in 1887 in the pine grove for which the community is named. The pine grove was cut down in 1957, but a group of students and alumni replanted pine trees around the school during a reunion in 2008. Pine Grove Elementary was closed as a K-5 school in 2011.

This is false; however, some anti-caking agents are known to collect at the bottom of the jars or cause the brine to cloud, a minor aesthetic issue.DSalf FAQ Pickling salt is very fine-grained, to speed up dissolving in water to create a brine, so it is useful for solutions needing salt.  Other uses  Pickling salt has applications other than pickling. It can be used in place of table salt, although it can cake. A solution to this would be to add a few grains of rice to the salt, or to bake it (which draws the moisture out), and then break it apart. Pickling salt sticks well to food, so it can be used in place of popcorn salt, which also has fine grains.

Originally called House of Israel Congregation, it was founded in 1888 as an Orthodox congregation by Jews from Eastern Europe. The congregation constructed its first synagogue building in 1903, and expanded it in 1924. It hired its first full-time rabbi, Maurice Moskowitz, in 1929; he served until 1934. By the 1940s the congregation had moved to Conservative Judaism, and with the installation of M. Robert Syme (1945‚Äì1948) as rabbi, transitioned to Reform Judaism. It joined the Union for Reform Judaism in 1949, and completed its current building in 1950. Rabbis since Syme have included Meyer M. Abramowitz (1948‚Äì1956), Robert Bergman (1957‚Äì1961), Joseph Hewzog (1961‚Äì1974), Samuel Weingart (1974‚Äì1985), Stephen L. Sniderman (1985‚Äì1996), and Jacques Cukierkorn (1996‚Äì1998) , the congregation's last full-time rabbi. It merged with Congregation Rodef Sholom of Youngstown, Ohio in July, 2013. Early history Jews from Eastern Europe first settled in Sharon in the 1880s. In August, 1888 they founded the Orthodox Temple Beth Israel (originally called House of Israel Congregation) so that they would have place to worship for Rosh Hashanah the following month. J.M. Rabinowitz (or Rabinovitz) served as cantor, ritual circumciser, Hebrew teacher, and ritual slaughterer. Services were initially held on the second floor of 62 Shenango Street. The first permanent synagogue building was constructed in 1903. By 1907 the synagogue had 40 member families, and its annual revenues were $1,000 (today $). Services were held on Shabbat and the Jewish holidays. The congregational school had two teachers and 25 students. A dissenting group who wanted more traditional services formed the Shaarah Torah synagogue. A number of years later Shaarah Torah re-merged with Beth Israel. A new sanctuary was added to the building in 1924, in time for High Holy Days that year. Beth Israel's first full-time rabbi, Maurice Moskowitz, was hired in 1929. He served until 1934, and was succeeded that year by Aaron Shapiro, who served until 1936. Shapiro was succeeded by Meyer Finkelstein, who served until 1937, and then by Harry Seeve, who served from 1937 to 1941. Sidney Riback joined as rabbi in 1941; by this time the synagogue had moved to Conservative Judaism. By 1942 there were approximately 140 Jewish families in Sharon, and the women of House of Israel had formed a sisterhood. Move to Reform The members voted to reform services in 1945, and hired a new rabbi, M. Robert Syme. Born in 1920 in Winnipeg, Manitoba, he was a graduate of the Jewish Institute of Religion. When he arrived in Sharon, it had a Jewish population of approximately 150 families, and Beth Israel was its only synagogue. Syme changed synagogue ritual, adopted the Union Prayer Book, and added a choir and organ. These changes were resisted by some members. Syme also discovered that Sharon's Orthodox Jewish population was sharing space with Beth Israel's congregation, worshiping in the basement. He felt it important that the Orthodox Jews be able to pray in the sanctuary too; so, on Friday nights he followed the Reform service in the Union Prayer Book, using an organ, while on Saturday mornings he followed the services from an Orthodox siddur (prayer book), praying without an organ. (Orthodox services normally do not use musical instruments, since the playing of musical instruments on Shabbat and many holidays are forbidden by Jewish law.) While living in Sharon, Syme also walked to synagogue and kept a kosher home, in accordance with Jewish law, to show that he was the rabbi of all of Sharon's Jews. Looking for the greater challenge, opportunity, and money a larger congregation could provide, Syme eventually resigned in 1948, moving to Temple B'nai Abraham of Butler, Pennsylvania. Syme would become better known as rabbi of Detroit's Temple Israel, where he served for almost 47 years, starting in 1953. Events since 1948 Syme was succeeded in 1948 by Meyer M. Abramowitz. Born in Rochester, New York in 1918, Abramowitz had an unusual educational background; he was a graduate of the Orthodox Hebrew Theological College, Columbia University and the Conservative Jewish Theological Seminary of America (both in 1943), and the Reform Jewish Institute of Religion, where he was ordained in 1946. He had served from 1938 to 1944 as a cantor and director of Jewish education at the Forest Hills Jewish Center, from 1944 to 1946 as its student rabbi, and from 1946 to 1948 as its rabbi. Abramowitz served until 1956, moving the following year to Temple B'rith Sholom of Springfield Illinois, where served the rest of his rabbinical career. In 1949, the congregation started using the Union Prayer Book for High Holy Days, and Beth Israel joined the Union for Reform Judaism (then Union of American Hebrew Congregations). That same year, the members began construction of the current building at 840 Highland Road (at Euclid Avenue). The building was completed by September 1950, in time for Rosh Hashanah. Abramowitz was succeeded as rabbi by Robert Bergman (1957‚Äì1961) and Joseph Hewzog (1961‚Äì1974). Hewzog was succeeded by Samuel Weingart in 1974. Raised in Des Moines, Iowa, Weingart was a graduate of State University of Iowa, and had been ordained at Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion in 1962. He served until 1985, and later served as rabbi of Temple Israel of West Lafayette, Indiana. Weingart was succeeded as rabbi in 1985 by Stephen Sniderman. A native of Toronto, Canada, Sniderman was a graduate of York University and was ordained at Hebrew Union College in 1975. He served until 1996, and was succeeded that year by Jacques Cukierkorn. Cukierkorn. Due to falling membership, the synagogue closed its doors and merged with Congregation Rodef Sholom in nearby Youngstown in July 2013. The Highland Road building was sold to a local Apostolic Christian congregation for roughly $40K and renamed Greater New and Living Way Temple of the Apostolic Faith.http://www.sharonherald.com/news/local_news/worshippers- will-again-fill-former- synagogue/article_598cdd1e-e5e1-5813-b026-5ffa9cf7aa2b.html NotesReferences *American Jewish Committee. , American Jewish Year Book, Jewish Publication Society, Volume 9 (1907‚Äì1908). *American Jews: Their Lives and Achievements; a Contemporary Biographical Record, Volume 1, Golden Book Foundation of America, 1947. *Angel, Cecil. \\"M.

These traveling salesmen would come into Plattsburgh for High Holy Days and occasional Sabbath services. The congregation initially worshipped in temporary locations. They soon had a rabbi, and in 1862, they acquired a cemetery. In the ensuing decades, congregations in less well-established nearby Jewish communities, such as the one Burlington, Vermont, would send their dead to Beth Israel's cemetery to be buried. In 1866 the members acquired their first permanent location, the former First Universalist Church on Oak Street. Plattsburgh's Jewish community grew after 1880 as a result of Jewish immigration from Eastern Europe. By 1907, Plattsburgh's Jewish population was around 125. The congregation, then still located on Oak Street, had 25 member families, and an annual income of $900 (today $). Jacob Lubin served as both rabbi and cantor, and services were held on the Sabbath and the Jewish holidays. The congregational school met twice a week, and had twelve students and one teacher. The congregation adopted Reform services in 1910, and joined the Union of American Hebrew Congregations (now Union for Reform Judaism) in 1913. Move to Bowman Street The current building at One Bowman Street was completed in 1971, and includes a sanctuary, school, social hall, and library. It houses a number of notable works of art, including Marc Chagall's tapestry \\"King David\\", Ben Shahn's silk tapestry \\"The Menorah\\", and the bronze sculpture \\"Remembering the Six Million\\" by Frank Eliscu, who also designed the Heisman Trophy. The building also houses a cut and painted butcher paper decoration by Jacob Hochfelder, who was Beth Israel's cantor and spiritual leader in the late 1880s and early 1890s. Designed for the east wall of the synagogue sanctuary, it is inscribed with the biblical verse fragment \\"I am ever mindful of the Lord's presence\\" (), and was created in 1887‚Äì1889. Fred V. Davidow, a 1973 graduate of Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion, was Beth Israel's rabbi in the mid-1970s. Yossi Liebowitz was rabbi in the early 1980s. During his tenure, he appeared on a Plattsburgh public-broadcast program called \\"The Religion Factor\\" with a Presbyterian minister and Catholic priest. He left Beth Israel in 1984. Minneapolis-born Eric R. Slaton became rabbi in 1985. Ordained by Hebrew Union College that year, he had served as a student rabbi at Cincinnati's Congregation B'nai Tzedek before joining Temple Beth Israel upon ordination. While at Beth Israel, he was also chaplain of Clinton Correctional Facility and Plattsburgh Air Force Base. Slaton served as rabbi for three years, before becoming rabbi of Ohavay Zion Synagogue in Lexington, Kentucky. Carla Freedman became the congregation's rabbi in 1990. A native of Winnipeg with a master's degree in educational psychology from the University of Manitoba, she was ordained at Hebrew Union College that year, the first Canadian woman to become a rabbi. She was also the first woman ordained at Hebrew Union College to become a grandmother. She served until 1997, moving to the Jewish Family Congregation of South Salem, New York. Events since 1999 In 1999, David Steinberg became rabbi. A graduate of Harvard Law School, he had practised as a lawyer for four years before studying and being ordained as a rabbi at the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College. While at Beth Israel, he was active in interfaith activities, and served as the president of the Interfaith Council of Plattsburgh and Clinton County in 2004 and 2005. That year he left Beth Israel to marry Peter Blackmer of Vermont, and become the associate rabbi of the Ohavi Zedek Synagogue of Burlington, Vermont. Heidi Waldmann, also ordained at the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College, served as rabbi from 2005 to 2008. Andrew Goodman joined as rabbi that year, his first pulpit. He left in June 2010, to pursue studies at Virginia Commonwealth University. He was succeeded by Emma Gottlieb, a May 2010 graduate of Hebrew Union College in New York City. As with her predecessor, Beth Israel was Gottlieb's first pulpit, though she had previously done a two-year internship at a synagogue in Rye, New York. Her father, Daniel Gottlieb, was also a rabbi. Though the younger Rabbi Gottlieb was supposed to start at Beth Israel on July 1, she was delayed in taking up the role because she was a native of Toronto, Canada. Recent regulatory changes made the application process for foreign clergy to work in the United States lengthy, and she wasn't able to enter the country until mid-August. Gottlieb served as rabbi until 2012. In July 2012, Kari Tuling became Beth Israel's spiritual leader. Ordained at Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati in 2004, Ohio she previously served congregations in Indiana and Ohio taught at the University of Cincinnati for five years. Temple Beth Israel is the only synagogue in New York State north of Glens Falls that has a full-time rabbi. , Kominsky was the synagogue's rabbi.

He succeeded Illanguli√©n in 1564 following his death in the Battle of Angol. Paillataru was said to be the brother or cousin of Lautaro. During the first years of his command he led raids from time to time to ravage and plunder the possessions of the Spaniards, always avoiding a decisive conflict. In 1565, Paillataru with a body of troops harassed the neighborhood of the city of Ca√±ete... The Real Audiencia of Chile that had taken control of the government of Chile, attempted to make peace with Paillataru. He conducted negotiations but with the aim to delay the conflict not end it. During the negotiations Paillataru took the opportunity to build a pukara in a naturally strong position within two leagues of Ca√±ete. When it became known in Concepci√≥n of Paillataru's activity, the court lost their hopes for peace, and appointed captain Martin Ruiz de Gamboa to head an army of 100 Spaniards and 200 Indian auxiliaries with Lorenzo Bernal del Mercado as his Maestro de Campo. Gamboa's force stormed the fortress and after a long fight captured it after setting it afire, and dispersed Paillataru's army killing 200 of them and capturing some others. Following the battle Pedro Cortez with a party of cazadores harassed the country immediately around the city so well that for a long time the Mapuche could not gather to conduct operations of significance.Vicente Carvallo y Goyeneche, Descripcion Hist√≥rico Geograf√≠a del Reino de Chile, Tomo I, Cap√≠tulo LVI. Primera fundacion de la Real Audiencia de Chile - Entra el Gobierno en este Tribunal - Se refieren sus ocursos. In 1568 Paillataru had collected a new army and occupied the heights of Catirai. Immediately, the new governor Melchor Bravo de Saravia marched against the toqui with three hundred Spanish soldiers and a large number of Indian auxiliaries. There Paillataru gave the Spaniards a defeat and the governor escaped with the remnant of his troops to Angol, where he resigned the command of the army, appointing Gamboa as its general. Intimidated by his defeat, he ordered Gamboa to evacuate the fortress of Arauco, leaving large numbers of horses to be captured by the Mapuche. Paillataru, who had moved from Catirai to destroy the Spanish fort at Quiapo, marched afterward against Canete, which he attempted to besiege. However Gamboa advanced to meet him with all the troops he could raise and in a long bloody battle compelled Paillataru to retreat. Gamboa followed up by invading Araucanian territory, intending to ravage it as they had before but Paillataru with fresh levies returned and compelled Gamboa to retreat.

Merrie Melodies animated short directed by Friz Freleng. The short was released on April 18, 1959, and stars Bugs Bunny. This cartoon recycles the plot from the 1948 cartoon Gorilla My Dreams. The title is a parody of John Steinbeck's novel The Grapes of Wrath. Plot The cartoon opens with the drunk stork talking to himself in the woods, while the gorilla baby he is supposed to deliver walks out of his bag. The stork is shocked to find that he has no baby to deliver. He has to find that new baby or he will be kicked out of the Stork Club. Coincidentally, what scene should appear next... none other than Bugs Bunny, who is singing \\"I dream of Genie, she's a light brown hare...\\" while roasting a carrot not too far from him. The stork knocks him out with a stick and takes him to the gorilla house, as the new baby. The bag is closed and they are both excited, until they open the bag, which reveals Bugs. Elvis (the male gorilla) goes to get a club to hit Bugs with, but the mother (who is dubbed \\"Mama\\" throughout the episode) stops him. Mama explains \\"no matter what he looks like, he's still your son.\\" Bugs Bunny awakens, and is not about to assume position of a baby gorilla, so he tries to get away, to which his gorilla mother responds with a spanking for trying to run away. Elvis growls at Bugs when mother gorilla prompts him to \\"kiss your son.\\" So she hits him over the head with a rolling pin, to get him to stop scaring the \\"baby\\". When Bugs saw that, he said to himself \\"Hey! This promises to be fun! Eh, so I'll be a monkey.\\" From that point on Bugs decides to make Elvis's life miserable. As Elvis rocks Bugs' cradle rather unpleasantly, he tries to sneak away from Bugs who responds with a horrid tantrum \\"Waah, I wanna drinka water! Waah, I wanna drinka water!\\"; to which Elvis responds by dumping a bucket of water over him then the scene changes to Elvis still holding the bucket then fades out just before the mother gorilla hits him with her rolling pin in response. The scene changes and they're outdoors, where Mama tells Elvis to \\"play horsey with baby.\\" Elvis plays for a few seconds then sends Bugs flying up into the air, then lands on Elvis; to which he responds by chasing Bugs. To Bugs' best of luck, Mama is nearby who soon takes control of the situation by clobbering Elvis with the ever-present rolling pin, then Bugs does the same while saying \\"bad ol' daddy\\" (almost like Tweety's famous line, \\"Bad ol' putty tat\\"). Mama leaves Bugs in the care of Elvis once more, this time with Bugs hitting Elvis constantly over the head with a baseball bat. Mama walks away while saying, \\"That's nice, Elvis. Keep baby happy.\\" Elvis then takes the bat and breaks it in two, but Bugs yells \\"Mama!\\" and Elvis decides to replace the bat for Bugs; rather than letting Mama know what just happened. While this is happening, the stork is already talking to Mama about his mistake, then gives her their real baby, Elvis hears Mama yelling: \\"Elvis, look. The stork brought us our real baby\\". Bugs finally realizes the danger that he is in (while uttering the piteous line \\"Mother!\\"), and tries to escape. Hiding in a tree proves fruitless when Elvis rips the tree up by its roots. Then he crosses a rope bridge and tries to keep Elvis at bay threatening to cut it if he crosses it; Elvis instead pulls the entire opposing cliff-side to him in one effortless yank of the rope. He tries to hit Bugs, but he gets away to the bottom of the cliff, leaving Elvis to smash the cliff to rubble. When Elvis sees him, he throws a huge boulder toward Bugs. Bugs has no idea that there's a boulder coming towards him, but runs away when he sees Mama coming to ask, \\"Elvis, guess what the baby said?\\" while she steps right into the spot where the boulder lands! Much to Elvis' horror, he tries to explain to Mama but ends up bawling in disgrace. Mama gives Elvis a sound thrashing with her rolling pin (off screen) finally having enough of his insane actions. Bugs says: \\"I'd like to see him eeh-ooh-aah-ooh and but his way outta this one,\\" while the stork mistakenly delivers a baby to Bugs. The baby turns out to be Daffy. Daffy ends the cartoon by kissing and hugging Bugs and saying: \\"Mother! My dearest little mommy! Oh. I just love you, Mommy!\\", all to Bugs' noticeable annoyance. Availability \\"Apes of Wrath\\" is available, uncensored and uncut, on the Looney Tunes Superstars and Looney Tunes: Unleashed DVDs. However, in both cases it was cropped to widescreen. It was also included in the Stars of Space Jam: Bugs Bunny DVD, but this time in the ratio in which it was originally animated (fullscreen aspect ratio).

The last one was Giunta's, which went out of business soon after Clemens. During the 1980s and 1990s, Clemens expanded by opening many new locations; eventually Clemens operated 20 supermarkets in three Pennsylvania counties, moving its headquarters to Kulpsville, Pennsylvania in 1993. The chain eventually acquired many Thriftway/Shop 'n Bag franchises. Many of these were also former Acme, A&P;, Food Fair, and Penn Fruit stores. Clemens later acquired many former Shop 'n Save stores which themselves started as Super G. In 1999, it introduced its upscale FoodSource division, which had three locations. One of these stores was a former Zagara's, a gourmet supermarket chain itself a division of Genuardi's and later Safeway.

Coastal produced, gathered, processed, transported, stored and marketed natural gas throughout the United States and by the 1990s, Coastal's 20,000-mile pipeline network transported five billion cubic feet of natural gas daily. These pipelines include the Iroquois and Great Lakes pipeline, completed in 1991, and the Empire State Pipeline, completed in 1992. Founder Oscar Wyatt Founder Oscar Wyatt was born into poverty in Beaumont, Texas. He was abandoned by an alcoholic father and was raised by a single mother in Navasota, Texas. Wyatt served in World War II and was decorated and wounded twice as a bomber pilot. Earning a degree in mechanical engineering from Texas A & M University, he gained experience in the oil business selling drill bits from the trunk of his Ford Coupe. He later worked for Kerr-McGee and Reed Roller Bits before becoming a partner in Wymore Oil Company. Wyatt founded Coastal States Gas Producing Company in 1955. Like Wyatt, Coastal began business in modest circumstances, with of pipeline and 78 employees. Wyatt was both beloved and hated, litigious and charitable. As a personal friend of Iraq's Saddam Hussein and business partner to Libya's Muammar Gaddafi, Wyatt urged President George H. W. Bush not to go to war with Iraq over Kuwait and later negotiated with Saddam to secure the release of western hostages being held in Baghdad. A 2007 Texas Monthly magazine article called Wyatt the real \\"JR Ewing\\" of the oil business, and described Oscar and his wife Lynn Sakowitz (a fixture of the Houston social fashion scene) together as \\"the beauty and the beast\\". While El Paso Energy was selling Coastal's petroleum marketing and production assets off piece-by-piece to competitors Valero Energy, Sunoco, and ConocoPhillips, Oscar Wyatt was being investigated for illegally doing business with Iraq's Saddam Hussein in violation of United Sanctions that strictly regulated Iraqi sales of crude oil. In 2007, Oscar Wyatt pleaded guilty in a U.S. federal court to illegally sending payments to Iraq under the Oil-for-Food Programme. At his sentencing hearing, Wyatt's attorney Shargel (who also defended Mafia boss Jon Gotti) pointed to a commission report, led by former Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker, that concluded that about half of the 4,500 companies in the Oil-for-Food Program paid a total of $1.8 billion in kickbacks and illicit surcharges to Saddam‚Äôs regime. Wyatt's defense also floated the issue of \\"vindictive prosecution\\"‚Äîthat is, the Bush administration singling out its old nemesis in both the oil patch and politics, Oscar Wyatt, for punishment but leaving other possible violators of the sanctions alone. Prosecutors, in turn, amassed a daunting paper trail and rewarded a few former Iraqi petrocrats with help in obtaining U.S. green cards‚Äîas long as they agreed to testify against sanction breakers like Wyatt. Coastal corporate history= Early years = Coastal was founded in 1955. The original company name was Coastal States Gas Producing Company. =1970s: Rapid expansion= In the early 1970s events in the Middle East overshadowed the rise of Coastal. The Arab-dominated Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), by presenting a united front, began to win price increases. In 1971, OPEC cut production and raised prices by 70 percent, and by 1974 prices had quadrupled, leading to the 1970s energy crisis. LoVaca, Coastal's pipeline subsidiary, had signed fixed-price contracts to supply cities in south Texas with natural gas. With energy prices soaring and supplies dwindling, LoVaca could not meet its contractual obligations. At one point it cut off gas supplies to the cities of San Antonio and Austin during the winter. Wyatt then obtained regulatory permission to increase prices beyond the limits specified in the contracts.Coastal Corporation. Texas State Historical Association. LoVaca was the target of lawsuits by outraged customers. Its difficulties caused problems for Coastal for years. Coastal finally settled $1.6 billion in lawsuits by agreeing to spin-off LoVaca. The spin-off, Valero Energy Corporation, formed on December 31, 1979, from LoVaca and other Coastal assets, had annual revenues of about $1 billion. The customers suing Coastal received 55 percent of Valero's stock, with the remaining split among Coastal shareholders, not including Wyatt. At the plaintiffs' insistence, he was excluded from the agreement. Despite the impact of the energy crisis, Coastal maintained its profitability and continued to expand throughout the 1970s. The expansion was not confined to Texas. In 1973, Coastal acquired Colorado Interstate Gas Company, formerly the Derby Oil Company of Wichita, Kansas, along with its three refineries in a $182 million hostile bid. With the acquisition, Coastal became a national company. In 1973, Wyatt renamed the company Coastal States Gas Corporation. In the first half of the decade, Coastal also sought to diversify into other energy markets. In 1973 it entered the coal mining field with the acquisition of Southern Utah Fuel Company. Also in 1973, with the acquisition of Union Petroleum Corporation, renamed Belcher New England, Inc., Coastal began the marketing and distribution of petroleum products. By 1975 revenues had reached $1.9 billion. Coastal's expansion continued in 1976 with the purchase of Pacific Refining Company's plant in Hercules, California, which increased its refining capacity to about 300,000 barrels per day. In 1977 Coastal acquired Miami- based Belcher Oil Company, one of the largest marketers of fuel oils in the Southeast. =1980s: Name change and legal issues= In 1980 Wyatt changed the company's name to Coastal Corporation. In the same year revenues exceeded $5 billion. In 1980 in Houston, Wyatt and two other oil executives pleaded guilty to criminal violations of federal crude oil pricing regulations. Wyatt and the president of Coral Petroleum were each fined $40,000. Each company was required to refund $9 million to the U.S. Department of the Treasury, and each incurred $1 million in civil penalties. Economic recession and an oversupply of oil and natural gas, as well as conservation by consumers, led to Coastal's first loss, which amounted to $96.4 million for the year 1981. Wyatt trimmed the workforce and cut the budget, and within six months he had restored the company to profitability. In the mid-1980s the U.S. government sought to foster competition in the natural gas industry through deregulation. The new government policy, together with falling prices, created difficulties for many energy companies. Coastal not only survived deregulation it took full advantage of the competitive atmosphere by launching hostile takeover bids for other struggling energy companies. The mere threat of a takeover by Coastal could send the stock price of a target company soaring. In 1983, for example, Coastal's attempt to secure Texas Gas Resources failed, yet Coastal's initial investment in the company generated a total of $26.4 million in profits. Intervening companies that came to the rescue of Texas Gas Resources were forced to buy up shares held by Coastal at inflated prices. Wyatt's unsuccessful attempt to take over Houston Natural Gas in 1984 yielded a similar return of $42 million. In 1985 Wyatt set about acquiring American Natural Resources (ANR), a natural gas pipeline in the Midwest. Despite ANR's initial determination to stay free of Coastal's clutches, Wyatt pushed through an all-cash deal of $2.45 billion, which ANR shareholders could not refuse. The acquisition transformed Coastal into a major power in the U.S. gas business. In 1987, despite sanctions prohibiting U.S. companies from dealing with Libya because of its terrorist connections, Wyatt negotiated a deal in which Libya supplied oil to Coastal's refinery in Hamburg, Germany. Wyatt's deal was legal because foreign subsidiaries of U.S. companies were exempt from U.S. regulations. In the late 1980s, Coastal took advantage of improved economic relations between the United States and the People's Republic of China. In 1988 Coastal concluded an agreement with China National Chemicals Import and Export Corporation (Sinochem) for joint ownership of Coastal's Pacific Refining Company. Coastal and Sinochem each held a 50 percent interest in the West Coast refiner. The agreement provided certain advantages for both sides. Sinochem obtained an opportunity to invest in the United States as well as a long-term outlet for crude oil, and Coastal secured a dependable supply of crude oil in a volatile world oil market. This joint venture represented the first investment in U.S. energy assets by China. A key to the company's successful strategy was the continued high productivity of all Coastal employees, from unskilled workers to those in management. Coal workers employed by Coastal produced twice the industry average, and the expectations for Coastal's management staff were high. Indeed, the constant pressure for results led to a high management turnover, with Coastal's refinery business alone having five different managers between 1980 and 1989. =1990s: acquisitions, and steady growth= The U.S. government took action against Coastal's agreement with Libya in 1991 by prohibiting U.S. citizens from working for the venture. This act did not dissuade Wyatt from further deals with countries in the Middle East. Coastal bought large amounts of Iraqi crude in the 1980s, and prior to the commencement of the Persian Gulf War, Wyatt offered to sell Iraqi President Saddam Hussein part of the company's international marketing and refining operations. U.S. sanctions against Iraq following the war prevented Coastal from purchasing Iraqi oil, but Wyatt maintained close relations with Iraq in hopes of gaining access to the oil at some time in the future. In 1992 Coastal shut down its Derby refinery in Kansas when its refining and marketing division reported an operating loss of $192 million, but the company continued to grow, seeking acquisitions and joint ventures to streamline operations. In the following year, in fact, Coastal adopted an aggressive growth strategy. Through its subsidiary ANR Pipeline Company, Coastal completed construction on the Empire State Pipeline, a line that ran from Niagara Falls to Syracuse, New York. ANR held a 50 percent interest in the pipeline, and Union Enterprises Ltd. held the remaining half. Also in 1993, the company acquired Soldier Creek Coal Co. and Sage Point Coal Co., both subsidiaries of Sun Co., Inc. Wyatt gave up his post as CEO in 1995 but continued as chairman. David A. Arledge, the company president, became its CEO as well. In early 1995, through subsidiary Coastal Oil & Gas Corp., Coastal gained an interest in several producing fields, off the coast of Louisiana, from Koch Hydrocarbons, Inc. The company also acquired working interests in two dozen wells in the Utah area from Snyder Oil Corporation and bought the marketing assets of Exxon Corporation's subsidiary Esso Petrolera, S.A., located on the Caribbean island of Aruba. In 1996, Coastal entered into discussions with Westcoast Energy Inc. to form a joint venture to market natural gas and electricity and to provide energy management services. The venture, which would create one of the largest marketers of natural gas and electricity in North America, was named Engage Energy. To procure funds for additional ventures, Coastal sold its Utah coal mining operations for approximately $610 million in late 1996. The company planned to keep its coal operations in the eastern United States. When Wyatt stepped down as chairman in 1997, Arledge gained the additional post. In that year Coastal acquired an 11 percent interest in the Alliance Pipeline, designed to move natural gas from western Canada to the Chicago region. Construction of the pipeline continued through the late 1990s. In 1999 Coastal announced plans to develop a pipeline running from Mobile, Alabama, to Tampa Bay, Florida. The proposed Gulfstream Natural Gas System pipeline was designed to serve the growing natural gas and energy demand in Florida. It was projected that the pipeline would be completed by 2002. In the late 1990s, Coastal focused on its natural gas business. With excess reserves of crude oil and low refining margins, the global oil industry was in a state of chaos. The North American natural gas market, on the other hand, was a regional market, largely unaffected by global oil market conditions. In addition, according to Coastal, by 2010 the demand for natural gas was expected to grow considerably, from 22 trillion cubic feet to 30 trillion cubic feet per year. The company, therefore, chose to invest heavily in its natural gas operations, targeting the primary natural gas supply areas, which included the Gulf of Mexico, south Texas, the Rocky Mountains, and Canada. In June 1998 the company acquired additional interest in natural gas assets in Alabama, including a processing plant and a pipeline. To bolster its exploration and production operations, Coastal upped its exploration and production budget by $100 million in 1998 and by $290 million in 1999. Coastal acquired oil and gas assets in northeastern Utah and western Colorado in late 1998. The company also acquired properties in the Texas Coastal Plain, a region that accounted for 45 percent of Coastal's net gas production in 1998. By February 1999 Coastal had seven oil rigs in operation. In the Gulf of Mexico region, Coastal built five drilling and production platforms in 1998. Coastal also sought international opportunities for its exploration and production operations in the late 1990s. The company announced plans to start exploration in Australia, and in October 1998 Coastal signed a deal with Petrobras, Brazil's national oil company. Although Coastal concentrated on boosting its natural gas operations, the company continued to implement its growth strategy in other divisions. In Coastal's electric power business, the company increased its interest in a cogeneration plant in Midland, Michigan, from 10.9 to 20.4 percent in 1998. In 1999 Coastal announced plans to build a power plant in Colorado and indicated that it had reached an agreement with the Public Service Company of Colorado regarding the purchase of power. Coastal also participated in numerous international projects. In early 1999 Coastal purchased a 24.5 percent stake in a hydroelectric plant in Panama and also began operations at its Nicaragua plant. The company acquired a 66.7 percent interest in a power plant in Bangladesh and continued work on two projects in Pakistan, which were scheduled to be operational in 1999. Coastal hoped to have its Guatemala coal- fired power plant, which began construction in 1997, operational by early 2000. In September 1999 Coastal announced that, with GENER S.A., a South American electricity company, it had purchased 50 percent of the Itabo Generation Company from the Dominican Republic. Itabo owned six thermal plants near the country's capital. Coastal's refinery facilities expanded operations in the late 1990s as well. In July 1998 the company signed a five-year deal with PMI Comercio Internacional, S.A. de C.V., a marketing subsidiary of Mexico's national oil company, Petroleos Mexicanos, in which PMI agreed to supply crude for Coastal's refinery in Aruba. Coastal began expanding the Aruba refinery in September. In 1997 Coastal entered into discussions with Venezuela's national oil company, Petr√≥leos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA), regarding a venture involving Coastal's Corpus Christi refinery facilities. Coastal's refinery in Eagle Point, New Jersey, was busy in 1998 as well. In June Coastal finalized an agreement concerning the supply of crude with Norway's state oil company, Statoil Group. In other 1998 developments, Coastal sold or closed nearly 100 retail stores, including 64 Coastal Mart stores in the Midwest, to adhere to the company's decision to dispense with nonessential businesses. The stores continued to operate under the Coastal brand name. Coastal joined Chevron Corporation and Mobil Oil Corp. in a $200 million deal to purchase crude oil from Iraq. The agreement was part of the United Nation's oil-for-food deal, in which the proceeds of the sales would be used to purchase food and medicine for Iraqi citizens who had suffered significantly from economic sanctions in place against Saddam Hussein since 1991. Coastal also expanded its chemical operations with a newly established ammonia plant in Oyster Creek, Texas. In its coal division Coastal progressed with plans to transform the business from a processing and marketing company to one that mined, processed, and marketed its own coal. =2000s: acquisition, divestment, and litigation= Coastal's operating revenues dropped considerably between 1996 and 1998, from $12.17 billion to $7.37 billion, making it a target for acquisition. Although the company rebounded from increased production of natural gas by more than 16 percent in 1998, coupled with rising oil prices that made Coastal's Petroleum business increasingly profitable, the board of directors and founder Oscar Wyatt continued with merger negotiations. This resulted in Coastal being acquired by the smaller El Paso Energy, whose primary business was in natural gas. El Paso Corporation acquired Coastal in 2001, and El Paso largely divested itself of Coastal's Petroleum business with the Coastal brand being phased out. Its website was shut down immediately upon the buyout. El Paso has gradually sold off the Coastal retail gasoline business, and very few of its stations still exist under the Coastal brand , many having been converted to other major brands or generic brands. Sunoco acquired 245 service stations from Coastal on February 9, 2001, for approximately $40 million. Coastal's Eagle Point, New Jersey Refinery was sold to Sunoco while refineries in Texas and Aruba were acquired by Valero Energy. The majority of the Coastal retail gas stations were sold to Phillips 66 which later became Conoco Phillips.

She was the daughter of Count Ariprand von Thurn und Valsassina-Como-Vercelli (1925-1996), whose family, a branch of the Della Torre dynasty, ruled Milan in the 13th century, and his wife, n√©e Princess Maria von Auersperg (born 1929). Ludwig Rudolph and Isabelle had one son: * Prince Otto Heinrich Ariprand George Johannes Ernst August Vinzenz Egmont Franz of Hanover (born 13 February 1988) In the early hours of 29 November 1988, after the couple had entertained guests at their home, K√∂niginvilla (The Queen's Villa) in Gmunden, a house left to them by Ludwig's brother Ernst August, the prince went to the bedroom where his wife had retired before midnight, and found Isabelle sprawled fully dressed across their bed. The efforts of her husband and friends to revive her proved futile. As authorities later removed her body and investigated the scene, discovering syringes, cocaine and heroin, Ludwig Rudolph, who had been investigated previously on suspicion of illegal drug purchases, placed a call to his elder brother, Ernst August, in London, imploring him to take care of the couple's 10-month-old son.Eilers, Marlene. Queen Victoria's Daughters. Rosvall Royal Books, Falkoping, Sweden, 1997. P.173, note 41. Then he slipped away. Several hours later Ludwig Rudolph was found near his family's hunting lodge several miles away, on Lake Traun. He was in his car with the motor running. He had the muzzle of a rifle in his mouth and was dead of a gunshot wound. The case was closed without further investigation. Ludwig Rudolph and Isabelle were interred on 2 December 1988 at Gr√ºnau im Almtal, Austria, having been married less than 14 months.

It was premiered onstage c. 1635, acted by Queen Henrietta's Men at the Cockpit Theatre; and was first printed in 1641. Killigrew's first play, The Prisoners inaugurated its author's playwriting career. Genre Killigrew's first essay in drama was in the tragicomic genre, as were his subsequent plays Claricilla and The Princess. This is unsurprising, since tragicomedy was the favored genre of the court of Queen Henrietta Maria. The courtier dramatists of the 1630s, men like William Cartwright, Lodowick Carlell and Sir John Suckling, worked largely in tragicomedy. And Killigrew the courtier functioned in the same social and artistic milieu; \\"As part of Henrietta Maria's circle, he penned the courtly romances she favoured, such as The Prisoners....\\"Deborah C. Payne, \\"Patronage and the Dramatic Marketplace under Charles I and II,\\" in: Cedric Clive Brown, ed., Patronage, Politics, and Literary Traditions in England, 1558-1658, Detroit, Wayne State University Press, 1993; p. 165 n. 23. (For an extreme example of the type of drama favored at the Queen's court, see The Shepherd's Paradise.) Publication The Prisoners as entered into the Stationers' Register on 24 May 1640; it was published together with Claricilla in a single duodecimo volume in 1641, a book printed by Thomas Cotes for the bookseller Andrew Crooke. The volume featured commendatory poems by William Cartwright and Henry Bennet, 1st Earl of Arlington. In the 1641 edition, each of the plays has a separate title page; and while the title page for Claricilla is correctly dated \\"1641,\\" that for The Prisoners is misdated \\"1640.\\" This was a common feature of some of the early collected editions of plays in the seventeenth century. In, for example, the 1659 collection of Richard Brome's works, Five New Plays (also published by Crooke), the plays have separate title pages, and three are misdated \\"1658.\\" It is generally thought that the booksellers of the mid-seveneteenth century designed their collections so that the plays could be sold either individually or collectively, as market conditions warranted; and that practical and financial constraints sometimes extended the preparation of a collection over more than one calendar year. No evidence indicates that The Prisoners was ever issued in a single-play edition, either in 1640 or at any other time in the seventeenth century. The misdating phenomenon recurs in the publication history of The Prisoner. The play next appeared in print when it was included in Comedies and Tragedies, the collected edition of Killigrew's plays issued by Henry Herringman in 1664. Several of the plays in that volume have individual title pages dated \\"1663.\\" In the collected edition, The Prisoners is dedicated to the dramatist's niece, Lady Crompton. Location The collected edition also specifies the city in which Killigrew wrote each drama. Almost all of the plays were written in the various cities in Europe -- Paris, Venice, Naples, Florence, Turin, Madrid, even Basel in Switzerland -- where Killigrew lived during his Continental travels (1635‚Äì41) and his years in exile during the Commonwealth era (1647-60). Only The Prisoners was written at home in England, in London. Style and manner Like other tragicomedies of its era, the play belongs to a lush realm of fantasy and romance with limited relationship to reality. The play provides an \\"overplus\\" of \\"adventure, heroic dialogue, and sentiment...The Prisoners introduces us to a melodramatic pirate, Gillipus, who holds nobles as his slaves and kidnaps princesses. The locus is Sardinia and several scenes take place at sea.\\" The action is \\"brisk.\\"Felix Emmanuel Schelling, Elizabethan Drama, 1558-1642, 2 Volumes, Boston, Houghton Mifflin, 1908; Vol. 2, pp. 356-7.

History Built in 1914 for impresarios Marion Scott Pearce and Scheck, the 2300-seat theater was the foremost vaudeville house in Baltimore, as well as a movie theater. When the movie palace opened, it was the largest theatre in the United States south of Philadelphia.Theresa Donnelly, ‚ÄúHippodrome Theatre,‚Äù Explore Baltimore Heritage. Retrieved December 26, 2015 The Hippodrome was designed by Thomas W. Lamb, one of the foremost theater architects of his time. Lamb gave the theater an unusually strong presence on Eutaw Street through the use of brick and terra cotta on a massive fa√ßade. The Hippodrome was renovated in 2004 for use as a performing arts theater, and is part of the France-Merrick Performing Arts Center. The site had previously been occupied by the five story House Hotel, built in 1835 and destroyed by fire on May 25, 1912. The new theater had an original capacity of 3,000 seats and boasted a Moller organ, as well as a house orchestra that survived into the 1950s. The Loew's chain operated the Hippodrome from 1917 to 1924, then Keith-Albee-Orpheum assumed stewardship. In 1920 the average weekly attendance was 30,000. During the 1930s the Hippodrome featured such performers as Jack Benny, Milton Berle, Bob Hope, Martha Raye, Dinah Shore, Red Skelton, The Three Stooges, the Andrews Sisters, Morey Amsterdam, and Benny Goodman. Frank Sinatra first performed with Harry James at the Hippodrome. Live performances ceased in 1959, but movies remained strong through the 1960s. The Hippodrome finally closed in 1990 as the last movie theater in downtown Baltimore. Renovations Interior of the Hippodrome Theater in Baltimore after its renovation in 2004 The most recent renovation combined three contiguous existing buildings and a new structure: the Western National Bank Building (1887), the Eutaw Savings Bank Building (1888) and the Hippodrome into a major performing arts complex, designed by Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer Associates. The Maryland Stadium Authority led the renovation. Clear Channel Entertainment (now Live Nation) became the theatre operator after project completion. In 2008, Live Nation sold most of its theatrical assets, including the Hippodrome, to Key Brand Entertainment.

The Fuze is available in three different Flash memory capacities: 2 GB, 4 GB, and 8 GB and comes in six different colors: black, blue, pink, red, silver, and white.A White Fuze?! thread on anythingbutipod.com Storage is expandable via a microSDHC slot with capacity up to 32 GB, and unofficially to 64 GB or more via FAT32 formatted SDXC cards. All models have a 1.9 inch TFT LCD display with a resolution of 220 by 176 pixels and a built-in monaural microphone and FM tuner; recordings of the latter two are saved as PCM WAV files.  Media support  The Fuze supports MP3, WMA, PCM WAV, and, since the 1.01.15 firmware revision, OGG Vorbis and FLAC audio codecs. The Fuze can display both pictures and videos, both of which must first be converted with the Sansa Media Converter software for Windows; this program converts images to BMP format and videos to DivX-AVI, with specific parameters that make the media compatible with the device. Alternatively, the open-source, platform-independent Video4Fuze application can be used. Video4Fuze offers more options and the ability to save the file to a computer instead of having the device plugged in every time one wants to convert a file... The Sansa Fuze supports media playlist types of .m3u and .wpl. As of the 1.02.26 and 2.02.26 firmware revisions, Fuze now supports ReplayGain for MP3, WMA (non-DRM only), Vorbis and FLAC, which utilizes any ReplayGain metadata that has been encoded into the media files. Also, navigation by folder was implemented as an addition to browsing by metadata.Official Sansa Fuze Forums: Sansa Fuze Firmware Update 01.02.28 and 02.02.28Replay Gain: A how to informational at Official Sansa Fuze Forums  Operation  The Sansa Fuze is compatible with Microsoft Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X when USB mode is set to MSC as a drag and drop USB mass storage device. The player can also function as a Windows Media 10 and up device when USB mode is set to MTP. The Fuze's USB cable utilizes a proprietary connector that is compatible with its predecessor, the e200 series, as well as the c200 series. It has a mechanical scroll wheel (as opposed to the touch sensor on an iPod). Also unlike an iPod, powering the device off cuts all power usage (except for the clock) completely, rather than switching to a sleep mode that merely shuts down its visible operation. The Fuze has a MicroSDHC slot that can be used for standard media storage and for the proprietary Sansa services known as Slotradio and Slotmusic. The connector on the Fuze supports Line Out Dock (LOD) which is preferred to power an external amp, bypassing the internal headphone amplifier.  Software  Sandisk includes the Sansa Media Converter to convert video and photos for use on the player. Equivalent open-source packages also exist, such as Video4Fuze. For editing playlists, the Sansa Fuze supports Windows Media Player (in MTP mode), Winamp (in MSC mode) and YAPL for Fuze (in MSC mode). In auto detect, one can view the files like one views them on a hard drive. One can add music through these programs or just drag and drop via a file browser like Windows Explorer. Alternatively, one may install open source Rockbox firmware, which supports numerous formats and offers greater flexibility.  Fuze+  The Sansa Fuze+, announced on August 31, 2010 in capacities of 4 GB (US$79), 8 GB (US$89) & 16 GB (US$119), is a portable media player with a 2.4-inch color display (QVGA) and a touchpad. It also features an FM radio with FM recording, a voice recorder, and 24 hours of audio playback from a single charge. It supports the following audio formats: MP3, WMA, Secure WMA, Ogg Vorbis, FLAC, AAC, Audible, Podcasts. For video it supports MPEG-4, H.264, and WMV.

It is part of the town Sindelfingen.  History = Early history = The first traces of settlement in the area of Maichingen date from the 4th millennium BC. BC, when a Neolithic settlement existed in the area of today's residential area \\"Str√§uble-Propstei\\". A Roman manor in the area of this same Stone Age settlement, which dates from the second century AD, is around 4,000 years younger. A row grave field dated to the 6th century in the area of the old church testifies to Alemannic settlement activity. In 830, the noble Erlafried donated goods to the Hirsau monastery in the area of what would later become Maichingen. = Middle Ages = The first documentary mention of the place dates back to 1075. In a document, king Heinrich IV confirmed that Hirsau Monastery also owned the property in Maichingen, which was then called Mouchingen. On March 31st 1273, the first parish of Maichingen is mentioned. The parish connected with Hirsau Abbey in 1348, who purchased the Widernhof. Along with the procurement of the farm, the Abbey also obtained the Kastvogtei and the patronage law, i.e. the right to represent and protect the church in Maichingen as well as to appoint the pastor. Maichingen then changed hands several times and at times belonged to the Hirsau Abbey, the Count Palatine of T√ºbingen, the Lords of Maichingen and those of Rohr. During the second half of the 14th century, the House of W√ºrttemberg acquired the place. Maichingen was assigned to the Oberamt B√∂blingen. In 1850 Maichingen had 1,129 Protestant and one Catholic residents who lived and worked in 147 main and 127 auxiliary buildings. = Recent history = In 1971, Maichingen was incorporated into the city of Sindelfingen.

It is about two hours driving time from both Los Angeles and the Santa Barbara area. It is a sparsely inhabited area containing two primary towns ‚Äì Cuyama and New Cuyama, and also Ventucopa. The land is largely used for ranching, agriculture, and oil and gas production. California State Route 166 runs along most of the east/west length of the valley, connecting the Kern County and the southern San Joaquin Valley with Santa Maria and coastal Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo Counties. State Route 33 runs north/south through the eastern end of the valley, connecting the southern San Joaquin Valley with Ojai and coastal Ventura County. Geography The valley encompasses an area of approximately . It is bounded on all sides by mountains: the Sierra Madre Mountains along the south and west, La Panza Range on the north, and Caliente Range along the northeast ‚àí all of the California Coast Ranges System; and the San Emigdio Mountains on the east ‚àí of the Transverse Ranges System. The headwaters of the Cuyama River are just north of Pine Mountain Summit on State Route 33. The valley widens from the river's entry to a maximum width near the highway junction of Routes 166 and 33, near the corner of the four counties. Then it narrows again as the river flows west out of the valley through a narrow canyon between the Sierra Madre and La Panza ranges, to the Santa Maria Valley and its river mouth on the Pacific Ocean. The agricultural fields are in the center of the valley, near the Cuyama Highway junction and the two primary towns, where the alluvium is rich and the valley is a wide floodplain.Lantis, Steiner, Karinen, p. 193-4 North of the major portion of the valley is the Caliente Range rises, over which is the Carrizo Plain, a much larger inland valley. To the southeast is the high backcountry of Ventura County, which includes the highest summit in the region, Mount Pinos and other features of the San Emigdio Mountains. The far eastern end of the valley the San Andreas Faultzone crosses, and forms a low jumble of hills which Route 166 passes over to reach the southwestern San Joaquin Valley, with Maricopa, I‚àí5, and Bakersfield. The Los Padres National Forest lands are adjacent to the Cuyama Valley on the south, east, and northwest sides. Much of the land to the northeast, including most of the Caliente Range, is managed by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM). =Geology= Geologically, the valley is an alluvium-filled synclinal basin, at an elevation of approximately 2,000 to 2,500 feet (600 to 800 meters). Most of the rocks are sedimentary, and the Miocene-age Monterey Formation outcrops to the south, in the foothills of the Sierra Madre. Pliocene and Pleistocene sedimentary formations occur in the foothills along the south side of the valley as well. The large Morales Thrust Fault separates the abruptly-rising block of the Caliente Range from the valley itself on the north. Scenic badlands occur in the upper reaches of the valley, north and northeast of Pine Mountain Summit; they are reachable from Route 33 via Lockwood Valley Road.Jennings/Strand, Geologic Map of California, Los Angeles Sheet (1:250,000 scale). =Climate= The climate of the valley is semi-arid with hot summers and cool winters. Almost all precipitation occurs in the winter in the form of rain, although snow has fallen on occasion; only five inches of rain falls annually on the valley floor, making it the driest place in coastal Central California.Lantis, Steiner, Karinen, p. 194 Since the valley is open to the sea, there is occasional marine influence. The principal native vegetation on the valley floor is grassland and scrub, with chaparral and oak woodland in the hills to the south. History Looking south in the Cuyama Valley towards the Sierra Madre Mountains The native inhabitants of the valley were Chumash. The name \\"Cuyama\\" comes from a village named for the Chumash word kuyam, meaning \\"clam\\" or \\"freshwater mollusk\\". In addition to kuyam, other Chumash communities in the Cuyama Valley included Sxaliwilimu‚Äô, Lishawato‚Äôw,and Tsiwikon. Although the Spanish arrived in 1769 in California, the Cuyama Valley Chumash had little interaction with the Spanish until 1801. Between 1801 and 1822, over 400 people from the Cuyama Valley were baptized into Spanish missions. Over half went to Mission La Purisima, while most of the others were incorporated into Mission San Luis Obispo, Mission Santa Ines, and Mission Santa Barbara--all Chumash missions. Pacomio was a Cuyama Valley man baptized into Mission La Purisima in 1803. The decade 1811 to 1822 was a period when Spain ceased to subsidize missions. This put pressure on native Christians to produce more and to pay a tax to sustain the suddenly unpaid military. As a result, Cuyama Valley people made a transition to mission life at a tense time. In 1824, Pacomio was a leader in the multi-mission Chumash uprising. In 1825, newly independent Mexico sent a governor to California who liberated accomplished craftsmen from mission life. Pacomio became a free carpenter in Monterey, the Mexican capital of California, where he served on the town council. He died in 1844 of smallpox.John R. Johnson (2018). \\"Mission Recruitment and Community Transformations: An Ethnohistorical Study of the Cuyama Chumash\\" in Kathleen L. Hull and John G. Douglass, Forging Communities in Colonial Alta California. Tucson: University of Arizona Near the end of the Mexican period of Alta California the valley was split into two land grants along the Cuyama River, the Rancho Cuyama de Rojo in 1843, and the Rancho Cuyama de Lataillade) in 1846. The main land use in the second half of the 19th century was cattle grazing, although some homesteading took place in the latter part, especially in the side canyons where there was more water. In 1939, the first successful water wells using a pumping system were drilled. The groundwater aquifer is deep below the Cuyama Valley. The availability of irrigation water transformed the valley into an agricultural crops region. Little further economic development took place in the Cuyama Valley until the discovery of oil in 1948 at the Russell Ranch Oil Field, and more significantly in 1949 at the much larger South Cuyama Oil Field. Richfield Oil Company, later part of ARCO, built the town of New Cuyama to house the oil workers and their associated services. They shipped the oil pumped from these two fields by pipeline to their refinery near Long Beach. For a brief time in the early 1950s, the Cuyama Valley was the fourth-most productive oil region of California. As oil production declined ‚àí only about two percent of the South Cuyama Field's oil is estimated to remain California Department of Conservation, Oil and Gas Statistics, Annual Report, December 31, 2006, p. 67 ‚àí the main economic activity in the valley again became agriculture, although with the sharp rise in the price of oil in 2007 and 2008, petroleum exploration has again been of interest. Recently E&B; Natural Resources purchased the rights to develop the South Cuyama Oil Field from Hallador Petroleum. See also References * Charles W. Jennings and Rudolph G. Strand.

Formed in 2006 in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada by vocalist and guitarist James Farwell. The band was formerly signed to California-based Metal Blade Records. The band was released from its contract with Metal Blade Records in February 2013, and shortly thereafter, they reverted back to their original name Bison. Bison has released four studio albums and two EPs to date. They have toured with 3 Inches Of Blood, Genghis Tron, Baroness, The Ocean Collective, Priestess, Coliseum, Weedeater and High on Fire.  History =Earthbound and Quiet Earth (2017‚Äì2009)= In November 5, 2007 Bison released their first EP/LP titled Earthbound on Forest Records. It contained 6 tracks with a runtime of 30:51. On September 30, 2008 Bison B.C. released their first full length album for Metal Blade Records entitled Quiet Earth. Comprising 8 tracks with a runtime of 43 minutes. 'About.com' gave the album 3.5/5 saying that \\"There's a definite retro feel to some of the songs, but others are very contemporary. There are a few lulls and some songs that could be a bit shorter, but Quiet Earth is a surprisingly good CD from a relatively unknown Canadian band that shouldn't be unknown for much longer\\". The website 'ReviewBusters.net' gave the album a 9.5/10 stating that, \\"In Bison b.c.'s case you get a terrific album. Quiet Earth makes everything Mastodon put out look like child's play.\\" Jamie Hooper (scream vocalist from Canadian power metal band 3 Inches Of Blood) is a featured vocalist on the track \\"Slow Hand of Death\\". On October 27, 2008, RollingStone.com featured Bison B.C. as one of 10 Buzz-Worthy Breakouts as part of a feature called CMJ's Hottest Bands. Chris Steffen described them as \\"Heavy man. Real heavy. Jean-jacket heavy.\\" =Dark Ages and Lovelessness (2010‚Äì2012)= On April 13, 2010 Bison B.C. released their second full-length album, containing seven tracks, released by Metal Blade Records. Heavy Metal music critic Philip Whitehouse of OneMetal.com stated \\"if you're thirsty for unpretentious, balls- out, heavy-as-hell metal, this album is set to be the soundtrack to all your future raging keggers\\". \\"Dark Ages\\" was named the No. 6 Metal Album of 2010 by Exclaim! magazine. On October 22, 2012 Bison B.C. released their third full- length LP on Metal Blade Records titled Lovelessness. Containing 6 tracks with a runtime of 44:24. It was recorded by Sanford Parker at Soma and Electrical Audio Studios in Chicago, Illinois. This album featured the replacement of drummer Brad Mackinnon with new member from 2011 Matt Wood. WeLoveMetal.com described the album: \\"Lovelessness is a prime example of keeping your metal simple and straight forward. Instead of doing a lot of different stuff poorly, Bison makes their in your face metal balls to the wall.\\" AxisofMetal.com's Alex Gallant gives the album a 9/10 stating, \\"The band lays its outlook bare on this record, making you feel it through the construction of their songs and a wall of sound that pushes forward relentlessly like a tidal wave.\\" =Name change and subsequent events (2013‚Äìpresent)= Not long after severing ties with Metal Blade Records in early 2013, the band had changed their name back from Bison B.C. to simply Bison. Their first release under this name, the limited edition vinyl EP One Thousand Needles, was released in 2014, and Bison toured to support it.

They signed to Metal Blade Records under the name Bison B.C. The name change was done to avoid any confusion with other bands of the same or a similar name. In an interview with MindYourMind.ca, Bison B.C. guitarist Dan And gave their reason behind adding \\"B.C.\\" to the name stating, \\"The \\"BC\\" doesn't actually stand for any one particular thing. In fact we chose it because it could be interpreted in a few different ways. After a couple years as a band we discovered that there were a few other bands with the same name but of completely different musical styles. After some friends of ours experienced a horror show of legal trouble simply because of a name dispute we decided to cover our asses just in case.\\" The band had officially changed their name back to Bison by the time of the release of their 2014 EP One Thousand Needles.

The novel spent six weeks on The New York Times Best Seller list.The New York Times: \\"Fred Mustard Stewart, 74, Novelist, Dies\\" Plot summary=Introduction= Seven-year-old Princess Syliva Maria Pia Angelica Toscanelli is called to the Mother Superior's office. She is told that her father, Prince Filiberto was killed in battle, making the princess an orphan. Private Augustus Dexter is on his way back from Savannah, Georgia, after delivering confidential papers from General Sherman when he decides to spend the night at a burned plantation house, in order to rest and loot the house. An old slave, offers him his mistress's jewels for fifty dollars. Augustus gives him thirty dollars and his father's gold watch. He plans to sell the jewellery and use them to fund his plans of building a bank in New York. =Part I: Franco and Vittorio (1880)= Alice Dexter, the wife of Augustus, is vacationing in the Villa dell'Acqua after having struck up a friendship with Princess Sylvia. She meets Vittorio Spada, a servant child, with whom she takes a great liking to. Franco Spada, the older brother of Vittorio, and the gardener of the villa, bribes the local priest with a gold watch. Franco asks the priest to care for Vittorio, in the case of his death. The next morning, Princess Sylvia goes on her daily horse ride, when she encounters what appears to be an unconscious Franco. When she dismounts and attempts to wake him, Franco immediately holds her at gunpoint in the hopes of kidnapping her so that the royal family will give enough money to send him and Vittorio to America. Princess Sylvia laughs at him, and demands that he help her to mount her horse. Afterwards, she invites him to meet her at the library where she begins to teach him how to read and write. She is later warned by Alice of the suspicions that could possibly arise from her teaching Franco, particularly the suspicions of her husband. Princess Sylvia ignores it, and continues to teach him. Prince Giancarlo returns home after a bomb scare. He meets with a Mafia member to arrange for Franco's removal from his wife's presence. One night Franco is awoken and arrested for the rape and murder of a local girl. He is later arraigned and given a life-sentence. Princess Sylvia makes it her life goal to fight for his release, knowing that Prince Giancarlo, was likely behind the arrest. She writes to Alice explaining her woes and the fear for Vittorio's future. Alice, who is unable to produce children, decides to have Vittorio sent to America to become her son, against the wishes of Augustus. Franco is later transferred to the island of San Stefano to live out the remainder of his life sentence with hard labor. He becomes chained to Fillipo Pieri with whom he immediately bonds to. =Part II: Love Affairs (1890-1892)= Vittorio is now known as Victor Dexter, the legally adopted son of Alice and Augustus Dexter. Augustus continues to treat him as a nuisance but slowly shows signs of warmth. He is called into Augustus's office to be pressured into attending the family Christmas party. Victor decides to ask Lucille Elliot, his cousin, but she is already attending with her boyfriend. At the Christmas party, he dances enthusiastically with an unattractive girl, with whom he was tricked into dancing with by his cousin Rodney. Lucille takes notice and asks Victor to dance with her. Shortly after, a drunk Rodney and Lucille's boyfriend gang up on Victor leading to a public fight. Afterwards, Victor leaves and travels to Little Italy. A prostitute approaches him, and he decides to give in to his sexual urges for the first time. The next day Victor returns home to inform Alice and Augustus that he is moving out, and living with an Italian family. He meets Gianni, the family's son, who asks him to teach him English. When Victor returns to work at the bank, Augustus calls him to his office, to question the loan application of an Italian grocer. Victor informs him that he recommended the grocer to apply at their bank. The two argue after Augustus chooses to reject it based on his racist hatred of Italians. After the argument, Augustus approves the loan. A celebration with the local Italians ensues, and Gianni asks Victor to accompany him to a \\"club\\". The club turns out to be a gang led by Little Vinnie. Victor rejects the invitation to join and leaves. Alice is becoming weak due to tuberculosis. She celebrates her thirty-sixth birthday with her family. Victor meets up with Lucille and tells her that he loves her, and to marry him. She decides to date him. Upon their first date, he discovers that Howard Cantrell, the genial cashier of the bank is embezzling money. After confronting him, Howard runs and away and drowns himself. Augustus later praises Victor for his discovery, and finally attempts to connect with him. On his way back home, Victor runs into Gianni, Little Vinnie and their friend Marco. The three are drunk and decide to teach him a lesson. An accident ensues in which Marco is killed. Little Vinnie assures Victor before they leave, that Marco's death will not be forgotten. Later, Victor moves back home with Alice and Augustus. He later confesses the accident to Augustus, who accepts it calmly but secretly harbors mixed feelings regarding Victor's true nature. Alice dies ten days later from her illness. In Italy, Franco writes in his diary that Fillipo has died due to a heat stroke coupled with twelve years of backbreaking work. He plans to escape the prison and prepares to do so, only to find that the newly widowed Princess Sylvia has managed to have him pardoned by the King, and released.

He married Lucille and fathered three children with her. Also during that period, he and Augustus shared a greater relationship, before Augustus's death from a cerebral hemorrhage. Three days after Augustus's funeral, the will was read. Victor learned that he had been left a large amount of money. Yet, the controlling shares of the Dexter Bank were left to Lucille. Eventually, Victor came to understand that it was Augustus's way of conveying to Victor, that he did not completely trust him, after the night he learned that Victor killed a man. With Victor as the new president of the Dexter Bank, he immediately initiates great changes by reaching out to new classes of depositors - primarily the urban poor and immigrants. Little Vinnie learns of this change, and meets up with Victor at the bank to blackmail him into giving him a hundred thousand dollar loan. Victor fears that Little Vinnie will tell the media about Marco's death. He arranges to speak with the uncle of Julia Lombardini, his new secretary, due to his insights on Little Vinnie's criminal activities. Later, Little Vinnie and Gianni are arrested on charges of robbery. The two had been manipulated into committing a crime that Victor and an undercover police officer had planned. Lucille decides to use some of the income from the bank stock to build a mansion for the family. She hires Archie Winstead, an architect, to aid in the design and construction. Victor worries that she will drive the bank into bankruptcy with her spending. Tensions arise when she informs Victor that he can do nothing to stop her plans for the building, nor her plans for moving upwards in the social hierarchy. Eventually, Victor asks Lucille to sell him her stock. She refuses, because she enjoys the new power that she holds over him. On the day that Victor receives news of Little Vinnie's arrest, Lucille asks him to make love to her. He rejects her, making her realize that her once compliant husband is rebelling. During Christmas, Lucille is in London buying furniture for their home. Victor is invited to Julia's home to spend Christmas with her family. After dinner he and Julia walk along the beach, when he confesses that he is falling in love with her. She accepts his kiss before pushing him away and insisting that she be his secretary, rather than his mistress. Back at Julia's home, Victor asks her uncle who owns a local Italian newspaper for help in forcing Lucille to sell her stock. With the newspaper, they ask the Italian community to deposit their money into the Dexter Bank. Lucille returns home ecstatic with the deposits and increases in stock. She buys a new dress, only to discover that the new Italian depositors, are withdrawing their money. Lucille quickly realizes that Victor had planned the sudden deposits to force her to sell. They argue with Victor telling her that she has forced him into doing this for fear that she will sell the stock out of the family in order to climb the social ladder. She cries and asks Victor if he loves her. He admits that he does not know anymore. Afterwards, she tells him that she will sell the stock to him, leaving Victor to realize by doing so it may have cost him his marriage. Meanwhile, in Italy Franco is now a senator and living with Princess Sylvia and their twin sons. He uses his position to pressure the senate into launching a crusade against the Mafia. Sylvia worries for his safety and asks that he hire a bodyguard. Their son Tony, is under the tutelage of Cardinal dell'Acqua, in hopes of becoming a priest. The Cardinal presses Tony to encourage his parents to solidify their marriage by marrying. Despite Franco's continuous attack on the Church, the couple agree. Later, Tony's brother Fausto pressures him into coming along to La Rosina, the local brothel. Although Tony is initially resistant he agrees. He sleep with a woman for the first time. Later, he angrily admits to Fausto that he enjoyed it. The next day he informs his mother that he is going to be a priest. Back in America, Julia is now Victor's mistress despite her desire to be anything but. She argues with him to divorce Lucille. Victor continually insists that the timing is wrong despite his desire to be with her as well. Eventually, Victor and his family are aboard a ship to Italy where they have been invited to attend Franco and Sylvia's wedding. It will be the first time Victor has returned to Italy in thirty years. Yet, he cannot be happy while Julia is upset at him. That night, Victor and Lucille engage in an argument before Victor asks her for a divorce. She refuses and informs him that he is not rich enough for her to divorce him yet. On the third day of traveling, they reach Rome where Victor tearfully reunites with Franco. The two converse that night with Franco telling Victor, that it is apparent he is unhappily married. Franco and Sylvia are later married by Cardinal dell'Acqua where a grand celebration takes place afterwards. When the Dexter family returns home, Julia meets with Victor and tells him that while he has been away, she has been dating a wine importer and accepted his proposal in spite of the fact that she does not love him. Victor tells Julia that he has tried to divorce Lucille, but she will not agree. Julia does not relent and admits that she has grown to despise being his mistress. They depart by thanking each other for the last six years shared together. A week later Victor receives a cable from Sylvia informing him that Franco was run over by a car and killed. He retreats into a room to mourn his losses. In Rome, Fausto angrily tells his mother that his father's death was no accident. He is certain that the Mafia was involved. He promises to avenge his death. =Part IV: Over Here and Over There (1915-1917)= A woman named Elaine Fitzsimmons has approached Victor with the idea of writing a book about his life. He considers it, before inviting her to spend the weekend with his family at their weekend house on Sands Point.

Before leaving he tells her to contact him if she finds any good books that could possibly be made into films. Elaine has tea with Lucille who has been hiring her to seduce Victor. Lucille hopes that by entrapping Victor, she will receive a generous divorce settlement. However, Elaine finds herself turned off by Lucille's cold nature. She confides in Victor and the two become lovers. Unbeknownst to the two, Lucille is all too aware of their relationship and sends two photographers to their rooms. When he returns home, she triumphantly announces what she intends to reap from their divorce settlement. Before he leaves, she is startled to hear him say that he feels sorry for what he knows she will become. As he walks out she finds herself wishing he would come back. In Italy, Lieutenant Fausto and his men are captured during the Battle of Caporetto. The German captain who has caught him allows him to escape home where Princess Sylvia has transformed the palazzo into a hospital for wounded soldiers. Fausto returns and takes note of a pretty nurse named Nanda Montecatini. He asks his mother to introduce them. Yet, Fausto is not the only one to notice Nanda. Tony struggles with his role as a priest and his strong desires for Nanda. During Fausot's first date with Nanda, he mistakenly falls prey to the rumor that all Jewish girls are easy. He attempts to force Nanda to sleep with him. She knees him in the groin. He apologizes and the two agree to see each other later. Meanwhile, Tony confesses to Cardinal dell'Acqua his lustful thoughts of Nanda. Cardinal dell'Acqua insists that Tony must purge himself of such thoughts.

While at the party Lorna meets Carl Maria von Gersdorff, a concert pianist. Though engaged, she finds herself attracted to him. While filming Russia, numerous difficulties, accidents and upsets cause the film to be delayed and even more costly. Barbara decides to fund the film so long as Morris changes the genre to comedy, which he ultimately agrees to after realizing that all of the accidents and dramatic effects have essentially created a comedy. Back in New York, Lorna visits Victor to inform him that she is marrying Carl. Although happy for her, Victor feels even lonelier knowing that his last daughter is now leaving him. On the night of the premiere of Russia, Morris and Barbara return home. The film is well received by fans and critics alike.

One day, he attempts to kidnap Princess Sylvia in return for money to send Victor and him to America. The plan fails, but Franco gains a friend in Sylvia who decides to make it her goal to teach Franco how to read and write.

He is extremely resistant to Victor becoming his adopted son, and does little to provide him with the best clothes and schooling that he can afford. Much of this is due to Victor's prejudice against Italians. After Alice's death he and Victor share a warmer relationship. Yet, when he passes from a heart attack, he entrusts the controlling shares of the Dexter Bank to Lucille Elliot, his niece and Victor's wife. By doing so, he demonstrates to Victor that despite his death, he cannot completely trust him. *Alice Fairchild Dexter: Alice Dexter is the wife of Augustus Dexter and adoptive mother of Victor Dexter.

It is more commonly associated with animals than with humans. One of the most common forms seen by veterinarians is mouth actinobacillosis of cattle, due to Actinobacillus lignieresii. The most prominent symptom is the swelling of the tongue that protrudes from the mouth and is very hard at palpation (\\"wooden tongue\\"). Actinobacillus suis is an important disease of pigs of all ages and can lead to severe morbidity and sudden death.  Causes  The infection is most commonly caused by abrasions on different soft tissues through which the bacteria, Actinobacillus lignieresii, enters. These soft tissues include subcutaneous tissues, the tongue, lymph nodes, lungs, and various tissues in the gastrointestinal tract. The injury results in different forms and locations of the disease depending on the location of the tissue. The commensal bacteria is also commonly found in the oral cavity, gastrointestinal tract, and reproductive tract, sometimes resulting in disease. There are generally one or two cases of actinobacillosis per herd found in adult cows, foals or adult horses, and other similar animals.  Differential diagnosis  Mouth actinobacillosis of cattle must be differentiated from actinomycosis that affects bone tissues of the maxilla.

Gameplay The Wing of Madoola is a side scrolling action-adventure game. The player must progress through 16 stages, collecting items which increase the main character Lucia's power, and defeat the boss of each stage in order to gain entrance to the next stage. The Wing of Madoola resembles the anime , which was popular back when the game was being developed and released. The game is considered to be difficult to beat. Although Lucia's strength and health increase throughout the game, enemies generally do large amounts of damage, and many continue to smash into Lucia for multiple consecutive hits. Some stages are very large, and it is easy to overlook some of the more necessary items that can make the completion of the game much easier. Many of the bosses can withstand a tremendous amount of damage before being defeated. Plot Once upon a time, in the Kingdom of Badham, there was a statue of a bird known as the Wing of Madoola. Whoever possessed the wing would possess the power to rule the world, and many wars were fought between nations to obtain it. A wise king, one of the members of the Rameru family, managed to get a hold of the wing, and ordered that a deep cave be constructed where the wings would be hidden so that the wars would cease. The knowledge of the cave would be recorded and locked away, accessible only to the rulers of the land. Peace soon returned to the world. Several centuries later, a young member of the Rameru family known as Darutos learned of the location of the wing through the kingdom's secret archives. He betrayed the family and stole away with the Wing of Madoola. Using the power of the wing, he summoned demons to attack and take over castle Arekusu. He constructed an underground labyrinth beneath the castle, built a dangerous fortress, and planned to rule the world. The few survivors of Arekusu's military, and the remainder of the Rameru family fled the castle. They regrouped and devised a desperate plan to overthrow Darutos and regain control of the kingdom. Lucia, a brave warrior, was selected to accompany a member of the Rameru family who was uniquely capable of wielding magic known only to his family. As they approached Arekusu, they were beset upon by two powerful demons. While one distracted Lucia, the other attacked the Rameru family member. Lucia battled both demons and defeated them, but not before her partner received a fatal wound. Knowing what had to be done, Lucia bravely pressed forward, knowing that only she could stop Darutos, and regain possession of the Wing of Madoola. Reception and legacy The Wing of Madoola was well received by video game critics. Its heroine Lucia has been featured in various manga series and also made guest appearances in the video games Barcode World for the Famicom on 1992, Shanghai Musume: Mahjong Girls for the iOS and Android in 2011, and as a Symbol Art's picture from Phantasy Star Online 2 on 2012.

An illegal immigrant from El Salvador and member of the Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) gang, he was convicted in 2012 of the June 22, 2008 slayings of Anthony Bologna and his sons, Michael and Matthew, in San Francisco. Ramos was born in El Salvador, grew up in San Francisco, and later moved to El Sobrante, California. As a teenager, Ramos twice served probation for violent crimes but was not deported. Ramos's case brought much attention and outrage over San Francisco's sanctuary city policy that prevented city officials from enforcing federal immigration law. Shortly after the murders, San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom revised the policy to allow the city to refer undocumented juvenile felons to federal authorities. Perpetrator Ramos was born in El Salvador, where he was raised by his grandmother. The San Francisco Chronicle reported in 2008 that Ramos illegally entered the United States when he was 13 to live with his mother and two siblings, but later reports suggested that Ramos was a legal immigrant whose visa expired. In 2003, Ramos's mother reported him missing, and Ramos returned 11 days after his mother reported. On October 22 that year, Ramos was also one of three MS-13 members suspected of assaulting a man on a Muni bus for claiming not to be a gang member. Juvenile Court convicted Ramos of assault and street gang membership and put him in a shelter. On probation, Ramos was released to his mother's custody on April 2, 2004, but four days later he assaulted a pregnant woman and her brother. Ramos was convicted of attempted robbery, a felony offense, but was cleared of assault and served probation at the city-run Log Cabin Ranch where he lived from June 2004 to February 2005. (\\"The purpose of the facility is to provide a twenty-four-hour-a-day residential program for juveniles of San Francisco who have been adjudicated delinquent by the Juvenile Courts and sent to Log Cabin for treatment and rehabilitation.\\") After his release, he lived with his mother's sister. He applied for temporary residency but was declined; by then federal authorities had learned that Ramos was in the U.S. illegally. In 2006, former MS-13 leader turned informant Jaime Martinez told the FBI that Ramos killed 21-year-old Norte√±o gang member Rolando \\"Chino\\" Valldares in the Mission District of San Francisco. Having been a member of the 20th Street MS-13 gang in San Francisco, Ramos later moved to El Sobrante and joined MS-13 ally Pasadena Loco Sure√±os (PLS). On March 30, 2008, Ramos was arrested after police discovered his car had illegally tinted windows, no license plate, and a passenger named Erick Lopez who tried to conceal a gun that police found was used in a double killing. According to the police report, Ramos cooperated with police, but Lopez ran away but was later caught and arrested. Police had \\"numerous documented contacts\\" with Ramos and Lopez and identified both as active MS-13 gang members. Prosecutors declined to charge Ramos due to lack of evidence that he knew about the gun. San Francisco sheriff's deputies called Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to determine if the department wanted to hold Ramos in custody, but ICE declined. Murder case and trial On June 22, 2008, Tony Bologna (age 48) and his sons, Michael and Matthew (ages 20 and 16, respectively), were shot dead near their residence in the Excelsior district of San Francisco as they returned home in the afternoon from a family barbecue in Fairfield. Bologna was on his way home to rest before reporting to his job as night manager at a supermarket later that afternoon. Another one of Tony's sons was critically injured. Jaxon Van Derbeken of the San Francisco Chronicle reported the incident initially as one of road rage. Ramos (age 21) was arrested and booked on murder charges three days later without bail. Preliminary hearings were held in June 2009. The only survivor of the shooting identified Ramos as the shooter. In September 2009, the San Francisco Chronicle reported that Douglas Largaespada, an alleged MS-13 member, claimed that Ramos killed the Bolognas. Marvin Medina, who was injured in a shooting hours before the Bolognas were shot, testified in court in exchange for prosecutorial immunity. He repeatedly denied knowing Ramos or other MS-13 gang members; prosecutors questioned Medina to determine whether Ramos was seeking retaliation for the shooting of Medina in killing the Bolognas. However, Medina could not explain why he was driving around the San Francisco Mission District for two hours the day before he was shot and why he called several people but not 911 after being shot. On June 24, Sergeant Mario Molina, a San Francisco police officer who was an expert on Latino gangs, testified that Ramos thought the Bolognas were rival Norte√±os gang members. San Francisco Superior Court Judge Teri Jackson ruled on June 29 that Ramos would stand trial for three counts of murder, and Ramos pleaded not guilty on July 13. According to Sgt. Molina, Ramos stated that his friend Wilfredo \\"Flaco\\" Reyesruano, whom police identified as a leader of MS-13, shot the Bolognas. San Francisco District Attorney Kamala Harris sought a maximum sentence of life in prison without parole rather than the death penalty should Ramos be convicted. Mayor Newsom supported Harris's decision. Harry Dorfman and George Butterworth represented the prosecution; Marla Zamora represented Ramos in court. Judge Jackson removed Ramos's previous lead defense attorney Robert Amparan on January 7 because Amparan was representing Douglas Largaespada at the time. Marvin Medina admitted on December 1, 2009, that he had lied on the stand six months earlier and could not explain how Ramos obtained his cell- phone number. Additionally, Medina identified Reyesruano as the shooter of the Bolognas. When prosecutors attempted to check for a gang-related tattoo, Medina admitted that he was a former MS-13 member. As a result, Medina pleaded guilty to three counts of perjury regarding his claims that he had not known Reyesruano, that he had met Ramos only once before the preliminary hearings, and that he was alone when he was shot in 2008. Having been in jail since the preliminary hearings ended, Medina was sentenced to three years of probation on January 12, 2010, with credit for time served but remained held on $1 million bail as a material witness. In May 2012, a jury in San Francisco convicted Ramos of killing the Bolognas and attempting to murder a surviving member of the family. Judge Charles Haines sentenced Ramos to 183 years to life without parole on June 11, 2012. =Effects on sanctuary city policy= Tony Bologna's widow Danielle and other relatives of the slain family members blamed San Francisco's sanctuary city policies for the crime. The policy \\"bars city officials from cooperating with federal crackdowns on illegal immigrants.\\" On July 2, nearly a week after the murder of the Bolognas, San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom amended the sanctuary city policy to allow the city to refer juvenile illegal alien felons to federal authorities for deportation. Members of the Minuteman Project, a group of private citizens who patrol the Mexico ‚Äì United States border against illegal aliens, held a protest at San Francisco City Hall on July 30 denouncing the sanctuary city policy and calling for Mayor Newsom to resign. Cinnamon Stillwell wrote a column criticizing the policy. Jesse McKinley of The New York Times cited the Ramos case as among several negative consequences of San Francisco's sanctuary policy. Danielle Bologna advocated for District Attorney Kamala Harris to seek the death penalty for Ramos, but Harris pledged never to seek capital punishment for any criminal case. =Bologna's civil suit against San Francisco= On August 22, 2008, Danielle Bologna and other family members sued San Francisco, claiming that its sanctuary city policy contributed significantly to the three deaths. The city removed Bologna's civil suit to federal court because Bologna's case involved violations of federal constitutional rights, and Judge Susan Illston ruled on September 14, 2009, that Bologna could sue San Francisco in state court. Judge Charlotte Woolard of San Francisco Superior Court ruled on February 22, 2010, that the city couldn't be liable for any crimes that Edwin Ramos committed post-release because the city had no information that Ramos posed a specific threat to the Bolognas and that the sanctuary city policy was intended \\"to improve immigration controls\\" rather than prevent crime. =Appeal= Ramos appealed his case. \\"On appeal, he contends the court erred by admitting the following evidence at trial: (1) defendant‚Äôs allegedly involuntary incriminating statements made during extended police interrogation, (2) the lay opinion of the investigating police officer that defendant, rather than an accomplice, was the shooter, and (3) excessive, cumulative and prejudicial testimony about defendant‚Äôs membership and participation in a criminal street gang.\\" The California Court of Appeal for the First District upheld Ramos's convictions but ordered a sentencing correction on August 20, 2014.People v.

Sawyer, originally published in 1994 by Ace Books.Science Fiction Writer Robert J. Sawyer: FOREIGNER Index It is the final book of the Quintaglio Ascension Trilogy, following Far-Seer and Fossil Hunter. The book depicts an Earth-like world on a moon which orbits a gas giant, inhabited by a species of highly evolved, sentient Tyrannosaurs called Quintaglios, among various other creatures from the late Cretaceous period, imported to this moon by aliens 65 million years earlier. Plot summary In the beginning of the novel, Afsan is accidentally run over by a chariot, causing severe crush injuries to his face. As Quintaglios can regenerate large amounts of tissue, Afsan heals, and in the process, his eyes, which were cut out by Yenalb in Far-Seer, also regenerate. However, Afsan does not regain his sight, despite having fully anatomically functional eyes. Believing suggestions that the issue may be psychological, he consults Mokleb, who has recently pioneered the new field of psychoanalysis. While this does not cause him to regain his sight, it does cure the chronic nightmares and insomnia he suffered after setting up the royal culling in Fossil Hunter. With the moon on which the Quintaglios live continuing its inward spiral towards the giant planet known as the \\"Face of God\\", the death of their world continues to put a forced acceleration of Quintaglio scientific advancement. Within the discovered Jijaki spacecraft, the Quintaglios accidentally trigger the formation of a tower of kiit ‚Äì a blue nanotech material. Much to their astonishment, this tower extends all the way to the Lagrangian point above the moon's surface. Novato ventures upwards, making a monumental discovery: she discovers that there is a sort of surveillance camera system overlooking all of the worlds to which the \\"Watcher\\" (from Fossil Hunter) had the Jijaki transport life from Sol III (Earth). Staying to watch, she glimpses many life-forms, including red blob- like creatures, Quintaglios, and humans. She also notices that several cameras are returning black screens, unsettling her as to the possible meaning. Proceeding to explore the structure at the top of the tower, she accidentally opens an airlock, nearly killing her. While saved by the emergency systems, she realizes that the Quintaglio aviation advancements up to that point will not be sufficient to evacuate their moon, as there is no air in space on which winged aircraft can fly. Meanwhile, Toroca makes an equally astounding discovery ‚Äì another sentient species of saurian, inhabiting a small archipelago on the other side of the moon from the continent known as Land. These dinosaurs are markedly different both in physiology and psychology to the Quintaglios; most significantly, they use tools and cook meat, are capable of lying, and have a reduced sexual dimorphism, the last of which causes all Quintaglios except for Toroca ‚Äì who has no territorial instincts ‚Äì to immediately enter dagamant. After Captain Keenir kills two of the \\"Others\\" in such a frenzy, Toroca attempts to negotiate, not altogether unsuccessfully. However, the Others eventually decide that the Quintaglios are a threat to their survival and decide to exterminate them, sending a huge fleet for Land. In a last-ditch attempt to settle the dispute, Afsan ventures to one of the ships, where he is shot. Overcoming their cultural aversion to tools, the Quintaglios retaliate, using their prototype aircraft as bomber planes, dropping a napalm-like substance on the enemy fleet, destroying it. Afsan does eventually regain his sight, but shortly thereafter dies from his wounds. Toroca, having rescued a child of the Others, raises it as his own. In an epilogue, the Quintaglios have successfully achieved spaceflight, and send a great many starships out to many planets, including at least one ‚Äì the Dasheter ‚Äì to Earth, the original homeworld. Other advancements have been made as well; for example, the Dasheter is navigated by an AI named Afsan, built to mimic the mannerisms of the long-dead astronomer. Major themes Following with the style of the previous two novels in the trilogy, Foreigner displays the interaction between science and religion. Just as Afsan was the equivalent of Galileo and Toroca of Charles Darwin, Mokleb corresponds to Sigmund Freud, having pioneered a new form of psychology - psychoanalysis. The Science vs Religion theme has been further downplayed from what it was in Far-Seer, as the religions of the Quintaglios have partly faded in prominence. ReferencesExternal links *Robert J.

Clarke is currently president of Bruce Clarke Consultants, Inc., a defense consulting firm. He is widely published on military and national security affairs, including in his book Expendable Warriors (2007) and in a regular column for the Examiner. Family Clarke was born in Fort Benning, Georgia to Arthur F. Gorham and Corrine \\"Colonel\\" Bennett Gorham (later Clarke). After Gorham was killed leading paratroopers from the 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment during Operation Husky, the allied invasion of Sicily during World War II, Clarke's mother married Edwin R. Clarke, who adopted Clarke. Clarke's siblings are Dr. Richard Clarke and Cindy Clarke Carnahan.Clarke is not related to General Bruce C. Clarke, though the two became acquainted while Clarke was a cadet at West Point. Clarke married his wife Sue in 1969 after the two had met on a blind date during a golf tournament upon his return from Vietnam. While a graduate student at UCLA, the Clarkes appeared on the Newlywed Game winning a bedroom set. The Clarkes have three children, a daughter and two sons, and three grandsons and a new grand daughter. Education Clarke attended public schools in Wichita, Kansas before winning a scholarship to Middlesex School in Concord, Massachusetts.In September 2008, Clarke addressed the students of Middlesex at the school's Memorial Chapel. See http://www.mxschool.edu/common/news_detail.asp?newsid=476441&L1;=7&L2;=1 Excelling both as a student and as an athlete, Clarke was accepted to both Stanford and Harvard but, to the surprise of many of his Ivy League-bound classmates, elected to attend the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. In 1961, Clarke joined the Class of 1965 at West Point. While at West Point, Clarke was known for overloading on political science courses. He graduated third in his class in military history. Upon graduation in June 1965, Clarke received a commission as a second lieutenant in the cavalry. Clarke holds a master of arts degree from the University of California, Los Angeles. He is a graduate of the Command and General Staff College and the National War College. Clarke was a member of MIT's Center for International Studies' Seminar II. Battle of Khe Sanh In January 2013, Clarke used his Examiner column to recount his experiences at Khe Sanh and pay tribute to all those who fought there. What follows is the text of that article:Clarke, Bruce. \\"45 Years Ago Today,\\" The Examiner, January 13, 2013. Accessed February 13, 2013. MACV Advisory Team 4 Huong Hoa District Team pictured L-R: MAJ Whitenack, SFC King, LT Clarke, SFC \\"Doc\\" Perry, SFC Humphries, and SP4 Gehrke (kneeling) In Expendable Warriors: The Battle of Khe Sanh and the Vietnam War I argue that the US won the battle of Khe Sanh and lost the war at the very same time. There was a battle fought in Khe Sanh village on 21 and 22 January 1968 that very few people know about. Every military historian knows of the artillery barrages and the trenches that were the siege of the Khe Sanh Combat Base (KSCB), but what has been called the biggest ground battle of Khe Sanh took place when at 5 AM on 21 January 1968 the 66th Regiment, 304th North Vietnamese Army (NVA) Division launched an attack against the Huong Hoa District Headquarters in Khe Sanh Village (about 4 km south of the Khe Sanh Combat Base). The ensuing fight pitted a mixed force of six different groups (175 men) inside the compound against 2000 men of the NVA force‚Äîthe little band of warriors included: : :* The District Staff of Vietnamese officers and men led by Captain Tinh A-Nhi :* An understrength Vietnamese Regional Force Company :* Two Montagnard manned Popular Force platoons :* The Marines of a Combined Action Platoon (CAP) led by SGT John Balanco and the company headquarters led by LT Tom Stamper :* The four man Army advisory team led by Captain Bruce Clarke :* A two man Army Intelligence unit called Joint Technical Advisory Detachment (JTAD) consisting of LT Jaime Taronji and SGT George Amos The attack was from three directions with the main effort coming from the southwest against the RF Company. The weather was extremely poor with very heavy fog. The initial enemy assault was beaten off by the courageous efforts of the RF Company and by almost constant barrages of artillery using variable time fused rounds. Alter the initial assault was broken, the enemy simply backed off and using the positions he had already prepared, attempted to destroy the key bunkers by recoilless rifle and rocket propelled grenade fire. Simultaneously it moved into Khe Sanh village and setup mortars with which they attempted to shell the compound. At this time the police station was still communicating with the District Headquarters and made it possible to put effective fire on the enemy moving into the village. For the next four hours there were constant attacks or probes against the compound which were beaten off by the valiant efforts of Bru (Montagnard) PFs and the Vietnamese RFs working as a coordinated team and reinforced by the CAP Marines, which SGT Balanco moved to meet the threat. At about 1130 the fog burned off, during the next five hours there were three attempts to resupply the beleaguered garrison, which was in dire straits for ammunition. All during the afternoon CPT Ward Britt, an Air Force FAC, working out of Quang Tri put in numerous air strikes on the massed NVA who were trying to reorganize. On one of these airstrikes he put in two fighters on 100 NVA in the open and after it was over he could not see any movement, just bodies. The night of 21 January the NVA were unable to make an attack and only sniped throughout the night. Captains Nhi and Clarke collaborated continually and estimated where the NVA would withdraw to. A B-52 strike was requested and it was later learned that the strike had hit the Regiment, The next morning the evacuation of District Headquarters was ordered after Colonel David E. Lownds, the commander of the 26th Marine Regiment, ordered the evacuation of the Marines from the garrison and denied further artillery support‚Äîover 1200 rounds had been fired in the last 24 hours in support of the District Headquarters defense. The Marines and the wounded were evacuated by air. CPT Clarke and SFC King, two of the advisors, accompanied the District Forces who, using an unknown route, successfully escaped from the District Headquarters. That afternoon CPT Clarke accompanied a Special Forces strike team that conducted a heliborne raid back into the District Headquarters to destroy everything that the District Forces had left behind and to evacuate the over 150 weapons that the District Forces had captured. The District government, forces, and advisors spent the next two and a half months in exile at the Khe Sanh Combat Base where they dodged artillery rounds, took part in the defense of the Combat Base, and operated an intelligence net. The siege of KSCB lasted for 76 more days. During that time the ‚Äùagony of Khe Sanh‚Äù played on the front pages and news reports on Main Street thought out the country. The result was that while the battle of Khe Sanh was won (two NVA divisions were rendered combat ineffective) but the public relations battle and thus the war was lost. Army career Following Ranger and Airborne Schools, Clarke commanded a 160-man airborne cavalry troop in Germany. From there he deployed to Vietnam first as an assistant district advisor and then as a district advisor. Clarke fought in the Battle of Khe Sanh and later participated in both the planning for and retaking of the combat base. In 2007, Clarke wrote about his experiences in Expendable Warriors from Praeger Security International.The book's website is located at http://www.expendablewarriors.com. and later Stackpole Military History Series. Returning from Vietnam, and recently married, Clarke moved to Los Angeles to attend the University of California, Los Angeles where he earned a master of arts degree. Because of a shortage of officers, Clarke was forced to leave UCLA before finishing his PhD for a teaching post in the Department of Social Sciences at West Point. Among his students at West Point was David H. Petraeus.Interview, \\"The Media Lizzy Show,\\" May 2, 2008, Available at http://www.blogtalkradio.com/medializzy/2008/05/02/heading-right-with-media- lizzy, accessed November 27, 2010 Clarke next attended the Command and General Staff College at Ft. Leavenworth, Kansas and then moved up through a variety of positions within the 1st Infantry Division at Ft. Riley, Kansas. In 1979, Clarke was tapped to join the Army Staff in the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations and Plans in the Political-Military Division under future Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman General John Shalikashvili, who had served on the same MACV advisory team in Vietnam. One of his first assignments was as a member of the Reagan-Carter presidential transition team. Clarke also worked on the ABM Treaty. In early 1982, he left the Pentagon to take command of the 2nd Squadron, 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment in Bad Kissingen, Germany. Clarke and his troopers were responsible for over 150-km of the East-West German border in the Fulda Gap. During this period, the Squadron fielded both the M1 Abrams main battle tank and the M2 Bradley fighting vehicle. General Gordon Sullivan Next, Clarke attended the National War College graduating with the class of 1985. From there he joined the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency inside the State Department working for Ambassador Ken Adelman. Clarke served as the senior military officer in arms control negotiations with the Soviet Union. After his first year at the State Department he was selected for brigade command but the busy pace of Soviet-American negotiations caused his assignment to be extended one year beyond the normal two-year posting. In his three years at the State Department, he regularly shuttled between negotiations in Washington and Geneva. This period include three summit meetings between President Ronald Reagan and Soviet premier Mikhail Gorbachev: the November 1985 Geneva Summit, the October 1986 Reykjav√≠k Summit and the December 1987 Washington summit where the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty was signed. In 1988, Clarke returned to the uniformed Army as commander of the 2nd Brigade, 1st Infantry Division at Ft. Riley, Kansas. The brigade was composed of 2‚Äì16 Infantry Battalion, 3‚Äì37 Armor Battalion, and 4‚Äì37 Armor Battalion, plus supporting units and a battalion from the Minnesota National Guard. Clarke's training of the Dagger Brigade for desert combat would prove fortuitous as days after giving up command in 1990 to Colonel Tony Moreno, Iraqi forces overran Kuwait. The 2nd Brigade eventually helped lead the ground invasion during Operation Desert Storm capturing Safwan, the site of the cease fire talks between General Norman Schwarzkopf and Iraqi commanders.The Dagger Brigade's effort to capture and hold Safwan is described in General Schwarzkopf's autobiography, \\"It Doesn't Take a Hero,\\" on pages 474‚Äì490. In recognition of his service to the armor community, in 1990 Clarke was inducted into the Order of Saint George, one of the U.S. Armor Association's highest honors.For more information about the Order of St. George see the U.S. Armor Association's website at http://www.usarmor-assn.org/stgeorge.aspx . That same year, Kansas Governor Mike Hayden named Clarke an \\"honorary Kansan\\" apparently unaware that Clarke was a lifelong Kansan. Clarke's final posting was as Director of National Security Studies at the U.S. Army War College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. While at the Army War College he published extensively on military modernization and helped shape the work on conflict termination studies. In late-1992 this work was put to the test when, following President George H. W. Bush's deployment of forces to Somalia for Operation Restore Hope, Clarke led a team to consult with the Joint Chiefs of Staff on building an exit strategy. The military and political bureaucracies rejected their advice and failed to establish a coherent policy to guide the withdrawal of forces. The U.S. was further drawn into the conflict before President Bill Clinton pulled troops out after the Battle of Mogadishu and the Blackhawk down incident. Clinton and his Secretary of Defense Leslie Aspin were roundly criticized for also failing to establish an exit strategy. For his work at the Army War College, Clarke was awarded the General Dwight D. Eisenhower Chair in National Security in 1994. In 1995, following 30-years on active duty, Clarke retired. Army Chief of Staff General Gordon R. Sullivan presided over the ceremony and awarded Clarke the Legion of Merit. Post-Army career Following his retirement from the Army, Clarke was the Training Manager at the Royal Saudi Land Forces Armored Institute in Tabuk, Saudi Arabia training Saudi armor officers and soldiers on the M1A2 main battle tank. After the Gulf War, the Saudis purchased 315 M1 tanks, enough to outfit a full armored division (or two mechanized infantry divisions). In 1998 Clarke returned to the U.S. and joined QuVis, a start-up technology company, where he helped them develop their military and government business. In 2000, Clarke founded Bruce Clarke Consultants, Inc. to work with defense contractors on technology integration issues. Since 2005 he has also served as an advisor to Rockhill Partners, a venture capital partnership. His work on defense issues, national security strategy and knowledge of the Middle East has led to his advising at least two members of the U.S. Senate. He also drew upon his experience during the Carter-Reagan presidential transition as a paid advisor to incoming Kansas Governor Bill Graves. Publications Clarke is the author of Expendable Warriors (Praeger Security International, 2007) with a foreword by former Joint Chiefs Chairman General John Vessey. The book is set to be released in paperback in April 2009 by Stackpole Books. He is also the author of Conflict Termination: A Rational Model (Strategic Studies Institute, U.S. Army War College, 1992). He was a contributor to Managing Contemporary Conflict: Pillars of Success edited by Max G. Manwaring and William J. Olson (Westview Press, 1996) and Maneuver Warfare Anthology, edited by Richard D. Hooker, Jr. (The Presidio Press, 1993). In addition to a regular column for the Examiner he began writing in July 2009, Clarke has authored numerous publications for military audiences having been published in the Army Times, Armor, the Joint Forces Journal, Military Review, Infantry, Field Artillery and the Journal of Conflict and Terrorism. Clarke has also been published in The Washington Post, The Baltimore Sun, and The Topeka Capital-Journal.

He is credited with teaching the Continental Army the essentials of military drill and discipline, helping to guide it to victory. Ethnic Germans served on both sides of the American Revolutionary War. Many, notably rented auxiliary troops from Germanic states such as the Landgraviate of Hessen- Kassel, supported the Loyalist cause and served as allies of the Kingdom of Great Britain, whose King George III was also the Elector of Hanover. American rebel agitators misrepresented such troops as mercenaries to fuel propaganda against the British Crown. Even American historians followed suit, in spite of Colonial-era jurists drawing a distinction between auxiliaries and mercenaries, with auxiliaries serving their prince when sent to the aid of another prince, and mercenaries serving a foreign prince as individuals. By this distinction the troops which served in the American Revolution were auxiliaries. Other German individuals came to assist the American rebels, but most who did so were already colonists. Allies of Great Britain The fate of the German auxiliaries that fought in the American revolution. During the American Revolution, many German-speaking states, such as Hesse-Kassel, were loosely unified under the Holy Roman Empire. Typically these were officially Lutheran, making them traditional allies of other Protestant nations. Importantly, this included the Kingdom of Great Britain, whose king, George III, was also the Prince-elector of Hanover in the Holy Roman Empire. King George III came from an ethnic German family and was the first of the British royal House of Hanover to speak English as his first language. Great Britain formed strong German alliances during the Diplomatic Revolution of 1756 and during the Seven Years' War had combined forces with Frederick the Great of Prussia to form a coalition that functioned as one Army. When the British colonies in America rebelled a decade later, several German-speaking states contracted soldiers to the British Army. Despite Whig opposition to using German soldiers to subjugate the \\"sons of Englishmen,\\" Parliament overwhelmingly approved the measure in order to quickly raise the forces need to suppress the rebellion. The leasing of soldiers to a foreign power was controversial to some Europeans, the people of these continental states generally took great pride in their soldiers' service in the war. In some instances, ethnic Germans even enlisted directly into British units, such as the 60th Regiment of Foot. The sudden demand for new soldiers placed a burden on recruiters. Base standards had to be met, including a minimum height and number of teeth required to operate flintlock muskets. Recruiters could be forced to pay losses due to desertion or loss of equipment. Recruiting from outside the Holy Roman Empire required the permission of Joseph II, so recruiters largely enlisted Soldiers from within the Empire. This put officers from one allied state in direct competition with officers from other states allied with Great Britain, as well as recruiters from Great Britain who also recruited from within the Holy Roman Empire. Americans were alarmed at the arrival of German-speaking auxiliary troops, on American soil, hired by King George III, viewing it as a betrayal by the King. Several American representatives to Continental bodies declared they would be willing to declare independence if King George used such soldiers against them. The hired German troops were referred to as mercenaries by the patriots.Taylor, 2016, p. 359 Patriot outrage was also reflected in the Declaration of Independence: Colonial-era jurists drawing a distinction between auxiliaries and mercenaries, with auxiliaries serving their prince when sent to the aid of another prince, and mercenaries serving a foreign prince as individuals. By this distinction, the troops which served in the American Revolution were not mercenaries, but auxiliaries. Early Republican historians, however, defended the term \\"mercenaries\\" to distinguish the foreign, professional armies from the idealized citizen soldier who altruistically fought for independence. Mercy Otis Warren promoted the idea of German auxiliaries as barbarians, but also as victims of tyranny. Throughout the war, the United States attempted to persuade German forces to stop fighting. In April 1778, Congress issued a letter \\"To the officers and soldiers in the service of the king of Great Britain, not subjects of the said king\\" which offered land and livestock to defecting German units, in addition to increased rank. At the conclusion of the war, Congress offered incentives‚Äîespecially free farmland‚Äîfor these ethnic Germans to remain in the United States.Eelking, 259 Great Britain also offered land and tax incentives to its Loyalist soldiers willing to settle in Nova Scotia. =Hesse-Kassel= General Wilhelm von Knyphausen The financial basis of some smaller continental states was the regular rental of their regiments to fight for various larger nations during the 18th century.The Hessian Mercenary State: Ideas, Institutions, and Reform under Frederick II, 1760-1785, Ingrao, Charles W. (2003) The Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel, in particular, was economically depressed, and had \\"rented\\" out professional armies since the 17th century, with general support from both upper and lower classes. This allowed Hesse-Kassel to maintain a larger standing army, which in turn gave it the ability to play a larger role in European power politics. Hesse-Kassel pressed eligible men into service for up to 20 years, and by mid-18th century, about 7% of the population was in military service. The Hessian army was very well trained and equipped; its troops fought well for whomever was paying their prince. The Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel, under Frederick II, an uncle of King George III, initially provided over 12,000 soldiers to fight in the Americas. Like their British allies, the Hessians had some difficulty acclimatizing to North America; the first troops to arrive suffered from widespread illness, which forced a delay in the attack on Long Island. From 1776 on, Hessian soldiers were incorporated into the British Army serving in North America, and they fought in most of the major battles, including those of New York and New Jersey campaign, the Battle of Germantown, the Siege of Charleston, and the final Siege of Yorktown, where about 1,300 Germans were taken prisoner, although various reports indicate that the Germans were in better spirits than their British counterparts. It has been estimated that Hesse-Kassel contributed over 16,000 troops during the course of the Revolutionary War, of whom 6,500 did not return.Eelking, 257 Because the majority of the German-speaking troops came from Hesse, modern Americans sometimes refer to all such troops of this war generically as \\"Hessians\\". Hessian officer (later General) Adam Ludwig Ochs estimated that 1,800 Hessian soldiers were killed, but many in the Hessian army intended on staying in America, and remained after the war.Eelking, 258 Captain Frederick Zeng, for example, served out his term with the armies of Hesse-Kassel and remained in the United States, even becoming an associate of Philip Schuyler. Hesse-Kassel signed a treaty of alliance with Great Britain to supply fifteen regiments, four grenadier battalions, two j√§ger companies, and three companies of artillery.Eelking, 16 The j√§gers in particular were carefully recruited and well paid, well clothed, and free from manual labor.J√§gers were offered a signing bonus of one Louis d'or coin, which was increased to four Louis d'or as Hesse tried to fill its companies with expert riflemen and woodsmen. These j√§gers proved essential in the \\"Indian style\\" warfare in America, and Great Britain signed a new treaty in December 1777 in which Hesse-Kassel agreed to increase their number from 260 to 1,066. German-speaking armies could not quickly replace men lost on the other side of the Atlantic, so the Hessians recruited African-Americans as servants and soldiers. There were 115 black soldiers serving with Hessian units, most of them as drummers or fifers. Perhaps the best-known officer from Hesse-Kassel is General Wilhelm von Knyphausen, who commanded his troops in several major battles. Other notable officers include Colonel Carl von Donop (mortally wounded at the Battle of Red Bank in 1777) and Colonel Johann Rall, who was fatally wounded at the Battle of Trenton in 1776. Rall's regiment was captured, and many of the soldiers were sent to Pennsylvania to work on farms. The war proved longer and more difficult than either Great Britain or Hesse-Kassel had anticipated, and the mounting casualties and extended supply lines took a political and economic toll. Following the American Revolution, Hesse-Kassel would end the practice of raising and leasing armies. =Hesse-Hanau= Hesse-Hanau was a semi- independent appendage of Hesse-Kassel, governed by the Protestant Hereditary Landgrave William, eldest son of the Roman Catholic Frederick II of Hesse- Kassel. When William received news of the Battle of Bunker Hill in 1775, he unconditionally offered a regiment to King George III. During the course of the war, Hanau provided 2,422 troops; only 1,441 returned in 1783. A significant number of Hessian soldiers were volunteers from Hanau, who had enlisted with the intention of staying in the Americas when the war was over. Colonel Wilhelm von Gall is one well-known officer from Hesse-Hanau;Manfred von Gall: Hanauer Journale und Briefe aus dem Amerikanischen Unabh√§ngigkeitskrieg 1776-1783 der Offiziere Wilhelm Rudolph von Gall, Friedrich Wilhelm von Geismar, dessen Burschen (anonym), Jakob Heerwagen, Georg Paeusch sowie anderer Beteiligter Hanauer Geschichtsbl√§tter, Band 41, Hanauer Geschichtsverein, Hanau 2005, . he commanded a regiment from Hanau under General John Burgoyne. Among the units sent to North America were one battalion of infantry, a battalion of j√§gers, a battalion of irregular infantry known as a Frei-Corps, and a company of artillery. =Brunswick- Wolfenb√ºttel= Prince Carl of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel was a brother-in-law of King George III of Great Britain. Brunswick-L√ºneburg was a duchy that had been divided into several territories, one of which was ruled by George III as the Electorate of Brunswick-L√ºneburg (Hanover). The neighboring Duchy of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel (Brunswick) was ruled by Duke Charles I of Brunswick- Bevern; his son and heir, Charles William Ferdinand, was married to Princess Augusta of Great Britain, the sister of George III. In 1775 Charles William Ferdinand (\\"Prince Carl\\") told King George III that Brunswick had soldiers who could be used to help put down the rebellion in the Americas. In December 1775, General Friedrich Adolf Riedesel began recruiting in anticipation of the finalized treaty. Brunswick was the first German-speaking state to sign a treaty supporting Great Britain, on 9 January 1776. It agreed to send 4,000 soldiers: four infantry regiments, one grenadier battalion, one dragoon regiment and one light infantry battalion. The Brunswick treaty provided that all troops would be paid in Imperial Thalers ‚Äì including two months' advance pay, but required that all troops take an oath of service to King George III. A controversial clause in the agreement stipulated that Duke Charles I would be paid ¬£7 and 4s to replace each Brunswick soldier killed in battle- with three wounded men equal to one dead man; Charles, however, would pay to replace any deserters or any soldier who fell sick with anything other than an \\"uncommon contagious malady.\\" General Friedrich Adolf Riedesel Duke Charles I provided Great Britain with 4,000 foot soldiers and 350 heavy dragoons (dismounted)The heavy dragoons from Brunswick did not have horses and performed as foot soldiers. They were expected to acquire horses during the campaign, which led to the Battle of Bennington. under Lt-Colonel Friedrich Baum, all commanded by General Friedrich Adolf Riedesel. General Riedesel reorganized the existing Braunschweig regiments into Corps to allow for the additional recruits required by the new treaty. Experienced soldiers were spread among the new companies in the Regiment von Riedesel, Regiment von Rhetz, Regiment Prinz Friedrich, and Regiment von Specht, as well as the Battalion von Barner and dragoons. Braunschweig-Luneburg, along with Waldeck and Anhalt-Zerbst, was one of the three British auxiliary that avoided impressment, and Karl I vowed not to send Landeskinder (sons of the land) to North America, so land owners were permitted to transfer to units that would remain in Braunschweig. Officers and non-commissioned officers went throughout the Holy Roman Empire recruiting to fill their ranks, offering financial incentives, travel to North America with the potential for economic opportunities in the New World, reduced sentences, and adventure. These soldiers were the majority of the German-speaking regulars under General John Burgoyne in the Saratoga campaign of 1777, and were generally referred to as \\"Brunswickers.\\" The combined forces from Brunswick and Hesse-Hanau accounted for nearly half of Burgoyne's army, and the Brunswickers were known for being especially well-trained. One of the ships used to cross Lake Champlain flew a flag of Braunschweig to recognize their significance to the army. Riedesel's Brunswick troops made a notable entry into the Battle of Hubbardton, singing a Lutheran hymn while making a bayonet charge against the American right flank, which may have saved the collapsing British line. Riedesel's wife, Friederike, traveled with her husband and kept a journal which remains an important primary account of the Saratoga campaign. After Burgoyne's surrender, 2,431 Brunswickers were detained as part of the Convention Army until the end of the war. Brunswick sent 5,723 troops to North America, of whom 3,015 did not return home in the autumn of 1783. Some losses were to death or desertion, but many Brunswickers became familiar with America during their time with the Convention Army, and when the war ended, they were granted permission to stay by both Congress and their officers. Many had taken the opportunity to desert as the Convention Army was twice marched through Pennsylvania German settlements in eastern Pennsylvania. As the Duke of Brunswick received compensation from the British for every one of his soldiers killed in America, it was in his best interest to report the deserters as dead, whenever possible. The Duke even offered six months' pay to soldiers who remained or returned to America. =Ansbach-Bayreuth= The dual Margraviates of Brandenburg-Ansbach and Brandenburg-Bayreuth, under Margrave Charles Alexander, initially supplied 1,644 men to the British in two infantry battalions, one company of j√§gers and one of artillery, of whom 461 did not return home. A total of 2,353 soldiers were sent from Ansbach-Bayreuth, including an entire regiment of j√§gers. They were described as \\"the tallest and best-looking regiments of all those here,\\" and \\"better even than the Hessians.\\" These troops were incorporated into Howe's army in New York and were part of the Philadelphia campaign. Ansbach-Bayreuth troops were also with General Cornwallis at the Siege of Yorktown, with a force of nearly 1,100 troops. The Ansbach and Bayreuth regiments are remembered for a mutiny that occurred in Ochsenfurt. The soldiers were loaded onto boats on the Main River, but could not sail past the bridge at Ochsenfurt because the Prince-Bishop of W√ºrzburg, Adam Friedrich von Seinsheim, refused to open it. The soldiers were also forced to stand through the night in the over-crowded boats. On the morning of 8 March 1777 some Ansbach soldiers managed to get to the bank of the river and pulled the other boats to land. Wine merchants from Ochsenfurt soon arrived and sold drink to the soldiers. The officers tried to address their concerns, but some men deserted. Chasseurs were posted to keep men from deserting, and fired warning shots; the mutineers returned fire. When the Margrave of Ansbach received word of the riot, he rode through the night to reach Ochsenfurt. The Margrave convinced his soldiers to reboard the boats and provided two additional boats to alleviate crowding. The Margrave sailed with them as far as Mainz, where he succeeded in getting a bridge opened without the consent of Archbishop-Elector Friedrich Karl Joseph von Erthal. After the initial mobilization of troops, Ansbach-Beyreuth sent several other transports with new recruits. By the end of the war, 2,361 Soldiers had deployed to the Americas, but less than half, 1,041, returned had returned by the end of 1783. The Margrave of Ansbach-Bayreuth was deeply in debt when the war broke out, and received more than ¬£100,000 for the use of his soldiers. In 1791 he sold Ansbach and Bayreuth to Prussia and lived the rest of his life in England on a Prussian pension. =Waldeck= Waldeck had made a treaty to support Great Britain in London on 20 April 1776. Prince Friedrich Karl August of Waldeck kept three regiments ready for paid foreign service. The first of these regiments, with 684 officers and men, sailed from Portsmouth in July 1776 and participated in the New York campaign. During the campaign the Waldeck regiment captured wine and spirits belonging to American General Lee and were embittered towards the British General Howe when he made them empty the bottles by the roadside. The Waldeck troops were integrated into the German auxiliaries under Hessian General Wilhelm von Knyphausen. In 1778, the 3rd Waldeck Regiment was sent to defend Pensacola as part of the British force under General John Campbell. The Regiment was dispersed throughout West Florida, including Fort Bute, Mobile and Baton Rouge. The regimental commander, Colonel Johann Ludwig Wilhelm von Hanxleden, complained that his soldiers were sickened and even died due to the climate. The remote locations received few supply ships, and the soldiers' pay was insufficient to buy local goods. Prince August informed Lord Germain that Waldeck could not recruit new soldiers fast enough to replace those dying in West Florida. In addition to slow supplies, the British and Waldeck forces did not receive news in a timely manner. They were unaware that Spain had declared war on Great Britain until they were attacked by forces under Spanish Governor Bernardo de G√°lvez. When this campaign was complete at the Siege of Pensacola, Spain recruited many of the poorly fed and supplied Waldeck soldiers. British prisoners of war were later exchanged, but Waldeck prisoners of war were kept by the Spanish in New Orleans, Veracruz, and more than a year in Havana before finally being exchanged in 1782. Waldeck contributed 1,225 men to the war, and lost 720 as casualties or deserters. In the course of the war, 358 Waldeck soldiers died from sickness, and 37 died from combat. =Hanover= Five battalions of troops of the Electorate of Brunswick-L√ºneburg (Hanover), whose Elector was none other than the British King George III, were sent to Gibraltar and Menorca to relieve the British soldiers stationed there, who could then be sent to fight in America. Since Hanover was ruled in personal union and had its own government, Hanoverian troops were deployed under a British-Hanoverian Treaty in which Great Britain agreed to pay Hanoverian expenses and defend Hanover against invasion while the troops were away. These Hanoverian soldiers were defenders during the Great Siege of Gibraltar, the largest and longest battle of the war, and in the defense of Menorca. Late in the war, two regiments from Hanover were sent to British India, where they served under British command in the Siege of Cuddalore against a combined French and Mysorean defense. =Anhalt-Zerbst= The Prince of Anhalt-Zerbst, Frederick Augustus signed a treaty to provide Great Britain with 1,160 men in 1777. The Regiment of two battalions was raised in five months, and consisted of 900 new recruits. One battalion of 600‚Äì700 men arrived in the Canadas in May 1778 to guard Quebec City. The other, consisting of some 500 \\"Pandours\\" (irregular soldiers recruited from Slavic lands within the Austrian Empire) was sent in 1780 to garrison British-occupied New York City. Whether these troops could function as irregular light infantry has been much debated, although they were described by contemporary accounts as Pandours. Continental allies=German Americans= Frederick Muhlenberg, first Speaker of the House and son of German immigrants, studied theology in Saxony-Anhalt.Archiv der Franckeschen Stiftungen, AF St/S B I 94 I, 575-577 German immigration to the British colonies began soon after English colonists founded Jamestown. In 1690, German colonials built the first paper mill in North America, and the Bible was printed in America in German before it was printed in English. By the mid-18th century, approximately 10% of the colonial American population spoke German. Germans were easily the largest non-British European minority in British North America, but their assimilation and Anglicisation varied greatly. During the French and Indian War, Great Britain utilized the large German population in North America by forming the Royal American Regiment, whose enlisted men were principally German colonists. The regiment's first commander was General Henry Bouquet, a Swiss native. The regiment would later be commanded by General Howe. Other Germans came to North America during the French and Indian War, including Frederick, Baron de Weissenfels, who settled in New York State as a British officer. When the Revolutionary War began, Weissenfels deserted the British forces and served with the rebellion from 1775 until the end of the war, obtaining a Congressional commission as a lieutenant colonel. As with other ethnic groups in the British colonies, German-speaking colonists were divided, supporting both the Patriot and Loyalist causes. German loyalists fought in their local militias, and some returned to Germany in exile following the war.This refers to \\"Deutschland,\\" literally \\"the land of the Germans,\\" or the German states of the 18th century; there was no nation called \\"Germany\\" in the 1780s. New York had a notably large German population during the war. Other colonies formed German regiments, or filled the ranks of local militias with German Americans. German colonists in Charleston, South Carolina, formed a fusilier company in 1775, and some Germans in Georgia enlisted under General Anthony Wayne. German colonists are most remembered in Pennsylvania, partly due to friendlier naturalization terms for immigrants, and also because the German soldiers in Pennsylvania stand in contrast to the large, pacifist Quaker population in Pennsylvania. Brothers Peter and Frederick Muhlenberg, for example, were first-generation Pennsylvanians who were educated at the German Francke Foundations. Both were elected to Congress, and Peter served on Washington's general staff. Provost Corps Pennsylvania Germans were recruited for the American Provost corps under Captain Bartholomew von Heer,\\"It is interesting to note that nearly all men recruited into the Provost Corps were Pennsylvania German.\\" - David L. Valuska a Prussian who had served in a similar unit in Europe before immigrating to Reading, Pennsylvania prior to the war. During the Revolutionary War the Marechaussee Corps were utilized in a variety of ways, including intelligence gathering, route security, enemy prisoner of war operations, and even combat during the Battle of Springfield. The Marechausee also provided security for Washington's headquarters during the Battle of Yorktown, acted as his security detail, and was one of the last units deactivated after the Revolutionary War. The Marechaussee Corps was often not well received by the Continental Army, due in part to their defined duties but also due to the fact that some members of the corps spoke little or no English. Six of the provosts had even been Hessian prisoners of war prior to their recruitment. Because the provost corps completed many of the same functions as the modern U.S. Military Police Corps, it is considered a predecessor of the current United States Military Police Regiment. German Regiment On 25 May 1776, the Second Continental Congress authorized the 8th Maryland Regiment (aka the German Battalion or German Regiment) to be formed of colonial ethnic Germans as part of the Continental Army. Unlike most continental line units, it drew from multiple states, initially comprising eight companies: four from Maryland and four (later five) from Pennsylvania. Nicholas Haussegger, a major under General Anthony Wayne, was commissioned as the colonel. The regiment saw service at the Battle of Trenton and the Battle of Princeton, and took part in campaigns against American Indians. The regiment was disbanded 1 January 1781. =Europeans= European Germans also came to the United States as allied soldiers. Some Germans came to the United States under the French flag. Johann de Kalb was a Bavarian who served in the armies of France before receiving a commission as a general in the Continental Army. France had eight German-speaking regiments with over 2,500 soldiers. The famous Lauzun's Legion included both French and German soldiers, and was commanded in German. There were also German soldiers and officers in the French Royal Deux-Ponts Regiment. Frederick the Great (1781) Other Germans came to the United States to utilize their military training. Frederick William, Baron de Woedtke, for example, was a Prussian officer who obtained a Congressional commission early in the war; he died in New York in 1776. Gustave Rosenthal was an ethnic German from Estonia who became an officer in the Continental Army. He returned to Estonia after the war, but other German soldiers, such as David Ziegler, chose to stay and become citizens in the nation they had helped found. Perhaps the most well-known German to support the Patriot cause was Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben from Prussia, who came to America independently, through France, and served under George Washington as inspector general. General von Steuben is credited with training the Continental Army at Valley Forge, and he later wrote the first drill manual for the United States Army. In June 1780 he was given command of the advance guard in the defense of Morristown, New Jersey from General Knyphausen ‚Äì a battle briefly led by two opposing German generals. Von Steuben's native Prussia joined the League of Armed Neutrality, and Frederick II of Prussia was well appreciated in the United States for his support early in the war. He expressed interest in opening trade with the United States and bypassing English ports, and allowed an American agent to buy arms in Prussia. Frederick predicted American success, and promised to recognize the United States and American diplomats once France did the same. Prussia also interfered in the recruiting efforts of Russia and neighboring German states when they raised armies to send to the Americas, and Frederick II forbade enlistment for the American war within Prussia. All Prussian roads were denied to troops from Anhalt-Zerbst, which delayed reinforcements that Howe had hoped to receive during the winter of 1777‚Äì1778. However, when the War of the Bavarian Succession erupted, Frederick II became much more cautious with Prussian/British relations. US ships were denied access to Prussian ports, and Frederick refused to officially recognize the United States until they had signed the Treaty of Paris. Even after the war, Frederick II predicted that the United States was too large to operate as a republic, and that it would soon rejoin the British Empire with representatives in Parliament.

Following the Confederate defeat, Poindexter resumed recruiting in North Missouri, while Porter recruited in Northeastern Missouri. Poindexter gained recruits, but thereafter was not very successful. After Odon Guitar struck a blow against Porter at Moore's Mill, he turned his attention to Poindexter. In August, Guitar's forces overran and completely scattered Poindexter's green recruits at the Battle of Compton's Ferry and a subsequent fight at the Battle of Yellow Creek. Seriously wounded, Poindexter was captured on September 1. He would never again serve the Confederacy.

Several times in the 1950s and 1960s, due to financial constraints the paper published editions which repeated all of the same journalistic content as the previous week's issue, with only the date in the masthead changed. By 1968 the paper was nearly bankrupt, and Yvonne Lemieux sold it for just one dollar to the Centre des jeunes de Sudbury, which ceased general commercial distribution and converted the publication into its internal monthly newsletter.

As such, it was the first German antitank rocket developed after World War II, a conflict in which German hand-held antitank weapons such as the Panzerfaust played a prominent role during 1944‚Äì45.

Its principal periods of significance were 1850‚Äì1874, 1875‚Äì1899, 1900‚Äì1924, and 1925‚Äì1949. History After the three-story Bailey House Hotel, at Broad and Bridge Streets, burned down in 1863, the Nevada Theatre Association began fundraising for a new building. Stock was sold at $100 a share, and a ball was held June 1865 to cover the remaining costs for the rustic vernacular Victorian building. The building's architect, builder, and engineer are unknown. When the theater opened on September 9, 1865, the first performance was the John Poole two-act comedy entitled The Dutch Governor, or 'Twould Puzzle a Conjurer. Silent films were screened as early as 1908, and the theater underwent a remodel in 1909, retrofitted as a movie house. A slanted floor and electric lights were added in 1915. By 1957, it closed because of a sluggish economy, but it was later purchased through public donations and reopened in 1968. Building With over 200 seats, including balcony seating, the theater is in use year round for both live performance and movies. It is wheelchair accessible. The backstage area is located under the stage and is painted baby blue. It includes a small room with makeup mirrors. Performers Notable past performers include Lotta Crabtree, M√∂tley Cr√ºe, Jack London, Emma Nevada, Mark Twain, and The Second City comedy troupe.

It was released in Japan for the Family Computer on August 1, 1986, for the Virtual Console on March 20, 2007, for the Nintendo 3DS on September 4, 2013 and for the Wii U on February 4, 2015. Gameplay Valkyrie being surrounded by a group of enemies. The player controls Valkyrie in her quest to defeat Zouna and restore peace to Marvel Land. With brown hair and no helmet, she begins the game armed with only a short sword. The player helps Valkyrie fight monsters, collect gold and find stronger equipment which will increase her powers; eventually, she finds a helmet and cloak. With the people of Marvel Land terrorized or controlled by Zouna, she receives no hints or advice. The player must devise a plan to defeat Zouna, with many of Valkyrie's tasks not immediately apparent; some can only be guessed by exploration and experimentation. When Valkyrie defeats a monster, she earns experience points towards the next level and (usually) a small amount of money. Although money is scarce in Marvel Land, the player rarely needs it to buy equipment. All the game's items can be obtained for free if the player knows where to look. In addition to equipping weapons and armor, Valkyrie gains access to seven spells. When she learns each one depends on her intelligence, which increases with each level of experience. The first, and possibly the most valuable, of these is the healing spell. Plot In Marvel Land, people coexist in peace and harmony with nature, and the animals are docile. Humans, Sandras, Quarkmen, Tattas and other races mingle, working to improve their community. A large clock tower, resembling a stone grandfather clock, stands watch over the countryside; an ancient evil was sealed in the clock long ago with a key of time (stored in the middle of its face), and the people have lost their fear. One day, the clock tower mysteriously stops working. Before long, a villager takes it upon themselves to rewind the clock. Fumbling with the key of time, the villager drops it, and before they can pick it up, Zouna, a dark wizard who manipulates time, escapes and takes the key. Zouna wreaks havoc in Marvel Land, darkening and terrorizing its people and laying waste to the countryside. Confident in his power, he builds a castle, ruins once-thriving towns and villages, and separates families. Only a few scattered towns remained standing, a futile bastion against Zouna's invasion. Even Krino Sandra (known as Whirlo in Europe) would be subdued heroically by Zouna; Marvel Land needs a savior. Valkyrie, a fledgling shieldmaiden descends to Marvel Land from the heavens. In her first adventure, she wields a simple shield and a mace of light. Vowing to save Marvel Land from the darkness which has consumed it, her adventure begins. Development The characters and setting of Valkyrie no B≈çken were based on Norse mythology. Being one of the first third-party companies for the console, Japanese company Namco was seeing great success with their releases on Nintendo's highly-popular Family Computer. Their arcade game ports such as Pac-Man and Xevious were unprecedented successes, and generated a lot of revenue for the company. Seeing the Famicom as the next evolution in video games, Namco began to develop exclusive titles for the console instead of simply ports or remakes of their earlier arcade games. The first of these was Star Luster in 1985, a well-received space combat simulation game. With games like The Legend of Zelda being hugely popular for the console, Namco decided their next game would be a similar role-playing game, with a large, vast world and unique characters. Valkyrie no B≈çken was the result of this. The game's characters and world were designed by character designer Hiroshi Fujii. Joining Namco after graduating college, Fujii was initially assigned to the company's design department, working on the package artwork for games like Sky Kid, Tower of Babel, and Family Tennis. Once the division was dissolved, he was transferred to the game development department, becoming a character artist for Valkyrie no B≈çken. Fujii's drawings were used heavily for reference by the development team, acting as a design document of sorts. Due to hardware limitations, his drawings could not be accurately replicated in the game itself; most notable of these is Valkyrie herself, being blond on the cover art and dawning black hair in-game. Fujii looked to Norse mythology while designing the characters and setting. Valkyrie was originally depicted as a \\"child of the gods\\" in early sketches, but was changed to being a simple female warrior due to her design being drastically different from the Valkyries in Norse mythology. Release Namco published Valkyrie no B≈çken on August 1, 1988. It was published under Namcot, Namco's older home console game division from the mid-1980s and early 1990s. Included with the game was a detailed map that showed the first few areas of the game and hints on how to get some of the more valuable items. In 1998, Namco published Namco Anthology 2 for the PlayStation, which included ports and enhanced remakes of older Namcot games. Valkyrie no B≈çken was included, alongside a remake that had a more arcade-like focus rather than the original's traditional role-playing format. Namco Anthology 2 was digitally re-released for the PlayStation Network in 2013 under the Game Archives label. Two mobile phone versions of Valkyrie no B≈çken were released in Japan. The first was in 2006 for the FOMA 900i line of phones, specifically through the i-Mode cellphone network. The second was released in 2007 by Namco Bandai Games for the S! Appli digital storefront. Both of these could be downloaded through the company's official game services through these networks for a monthly fee, and featured graphics in the vein of its arcade sequel Valkyrie no Densetsu. The Famicom original was published for the Wii Virtual Console in 2007 for Japan, and for the 3DS Virtual Console in 2013 and the Wii U Virtual Console in 2015. ReceptionLegacy Valkyrie no B≈çken was followed by Valkyrie no Densetsu, a 1989 arcade game with simultaneous two-player play and a console conversion released for the PC Engine. That year an MSX2 game, Valkyrie no B≈çken II, was announced; although the game demo was included on DiskStation Compilation No. 4, its production was canceled. In 1992 Namco released a prequel to Valkyrie no B≈çken, Xandra no Daib≈çken: Valkyrie to no Deai, for the Super Famicom. Featuring Valkyrie's green amphibian-appearing friend, Krino Sandra (Whirlo), the prequel was released in Europe as Whirlo. Valkyrie no B≈çken was resurrected for the PlayStation in 1998 on Namco Anthology 2, with an upgraded (linear) version of the game side-by-side with an emulation of the Famicom original. Walk√ºre no Densetsu Gaiden: Rosa no B≈çken is a digital comic released by Namco for Windows on April 26, 1996. In it, the Great Goddess tasks Rosa with pursuing the monster T≈çrushin on a floating island in the sky over Marvel Land. Its audio drama version was released on March 25, 1996. In 2007 Namco released The Glory of Walk√ºre, an upgrade of the original game with enhanced graphics, for Japanese cell phones using the i-Apli system.

Great Easton parish contains the hamlets of Tilty, Gallows Green, Mill End Green and Duton Hill. The parish has a population of a few hundred people, measured at 1,035 in the 2011 census The village public house is, The Swan, located close to the church. A further parish public house is The Green Man at Mill End Green. The parish church is dedicated to Saint John and Saint Giles. History Great Easton dates from the 12th century. The village used to be known as 'Easton ad montem' or 'Easton atte munte' to distinguish it from Little Easton. The suffix denotes the mound close to the church in the grounds of Easton Hall. It is believed to be the remains of a motte and bailey castle, around which the village has grown since medieval times. The mound is 130 feet (40 metres) in diameter at the base and 43 feet (13 metres) at the summit, and is 21 feet (6 metres) high. It is surrounded by a dry ditch 45 feet wide and 5 feet deep. The mound may have been pre-Roman, Saxon or perhaps a Norman defensive motte. It was definitely in place in Norman times, as this the period in which the name 'Eystone ad montem' appears. Fifteenth- century houses make up most of the village today. In 1830 a murder befell the village and in the south porch of St John & St Giles church is an inscription (VII, pos. c. 1900) to a man found murdered in 1830 at Handless Spring. On the South wall of the churchyard there is an inscription which reads: :Near this spot lies a murdered man :Whos remains were found in Handless Spring. :Unfold the murderous deed if you can :And the Wretch or Wretches to justice bring. An archaeological dig on the site of the abbey in 1942 turned up the stone tombs of two monks, thought to have been killed during the sacking of the Abbey in 1215. When their remains were examined before being reverently re-interred, it was found that one of the skeletons lacked a head. Governance Great Easton is part of the electoral ward called The Eastons. The population of this ward taken at the 2011 census was 1,577. Church St John and St Giles church The parish church of St John & St Giles is a Grade II* listed building. It is Norman in design and was built on the site of an earlier Saxon church. It contains Roman bricks, along with many of the houses in the village. It has had many alterations, and at one time was cruciform, but the north and south transepts have disappeared, and only thickened walls indicate the position of the crossing tower. By 1460 the tower had disappeared, and the three bells that were in use were housed in a timber cupola over the west end of the nave. But this was demolished in 1899 during a major refurbishment, and a large timber tower was built, far taller than the current low brick tower installed in 1928. It was struck by lightning, and its ancient timber was installed into many of the old Tudor houses, including the 'King Post' of the tower installed into Essex House, with a plaque reading 'KING POST of Old Wooden Tower, GREAT EASTON CHURCH, erected 1777, Demolished 1928.' This makes the post at least 235 years old, but this is only half as old as most of the houses surrounding the church. Bert Pickford gave this account of his own unique perspective of the building of the new tower in 1928: \\"When the new tower was being built, the bricks were hauled up using a large basket on a pulley. At the end of a day's work, the basket was left on the ground with the rope still taken up through the top pulley, whilst the rope's tail end was coiled up near the basket. One evening, a bunch of us boys aged between 7 and 14 were inspecting the work, or looking for mischief. I can't remember which, but expect it was the latter! \\"We became very interested in the basket and rope and in no time at all the rope was uncoiled and, with a little help from us all, the basket got 'lift off' and was soon on its way to the top of the tower. This discovery was great, but to increase the entertainment and interest value, it was soon decided, without too much debating, that I, being the smallest and youngest, should view the village from above! \\"The basket came down and I jumped in, without a care in the world, and slowly was hoisted to the top.

Plinius wrote that the area north of the river Senegal was populated, during Augustus times, by the Pharusii and Perorsi Map with indication of the Pharusii and Perorsi Berbers moved south to Mauritania beginning in the 3rd century, followed by Arabs in the 8th century, subjugating and assimilating Mauritania's original inhabitants. Islamization took place only gradually, much later than in the Sahel, over the course of the 12th to the 17th centuries by the expansion of the Beni Hassan. From the 15th century, there was also limited European trading activity, mostly in gum arabic. The tensions between the tribal Berber groups which had established themselves before the arrival of Islam, and the Arabized and Muslim Beni Hassan came to a head in the Char Bouba war of 1644 to 1674. The resulting victory of the Beni Hassan sealed the fate of Mauritania as an Arabized Muslim territory, the last part of Africa to be acquired into the Muslim World before the Muslim expansion was checked by the European Scramble for Africa in the 19th century. There was French presence at the Senegal River from the 17th century, and by 1840, Senegal became a permanent French possession. The colonisation of Mauritania was an expansion of the area of French control over Senegal, beginning in the form of punitive expeditions against the Maures. The colonial period of Mauritania lasted for a mere two generations, from 1904 to 1960. The French authorities had difficulty in maintaining order in view of the numerous and complicated conflicts among the area's numerous factions and sub-factions. They attempted to abolish slavery in 1905, but with very limited success. there were renewed efforts to ban slavery in 1981 and 2007, in spite of which Mauritania remains the country with the largest proportion of enslaved population worldwide. Mauritanian independence was granted in 1960, following a 1958 referendum under the French Fifth Republic. Characteristics What is now Mauritania was a dry savanna area during classical antiquity, where independent tribes like the Pharusii and the Perorsi (and the Nigritae near the Niger river) lived a semi-nomadic life facing the growing desertification of the Sahara. Romans did explorations toward this area and probably reached, with Suetonius Paulinus, the area of Adrar. There are evidences (coins, fibulas) of Roman commerce in Akjoujt and Tamkartkart near Tichit Sahara in classical antiquity: Map of Roman presence and archeological findings in the Western Sahara region (p. 514) Some Berber tribes moved to Mauritania in the 3rd and 4th century, and after the 8th century some Arabs entered the region as conquerors. From the 8th century through the 15th century, black kingdoms of the western Sudan, such as Ghana Empire, Mali Empire, and Songhai Empire, brought their political culture from the south.Warner, Rachel. \\"Historical setting\\". In Handloff. The divisive tendencies of the various groups within Mauritanian society have always worked against the development of Mauritanian unity. Both the Sanhadja Confederation, at its height from the 8th century to the 10th century, and the Almoravid Empire, from the 11th century to the 12th century, were weakened by internecine warfare, and succumbed to further invasions from the Ghana Empire and the Almohad Empire, respectively. The first external influence that tended to unify the country was Islam. The Islamization of Mauritania was a gradual process that spanned more than 500 years. Beginning slowly through contacts with Berber and Arab merchants engaged in the important caravan trades and rapidly advancing through the Almoravid conquests, Islamization did not take firm hold until the arrival of Yemeni Arabs in the 12th and 13th centuries and was not complete until several centuries later. Gradual Islamization was accompanied by a process of Arabization as well, during which the Berber masters of Mauritania lost power and became vassals of their Arab conquerors. From the 15th century to the 19th century, European contact with Mauritania was dominated by the trade for gum arabic. Rivalries among European powers enabled the Arab-Berber population, the Maures (Moors), to maintain their independence and later to exact annual payments from France, whose sovereignty over the S√©n√©gal River and the Mauritanian coast was recognized by the Congress of Vienna in 1815. Although penetration beyond the coast and the Senegal River began in earnest under Louis Faidherbe, governor of Senegal in the mid-19th century, European conquest or \\"pacification\\" of the entire country did not begin until 1900. France created the boundaries of contemporary Mauritania and administered it until the independence in the 1960s. Because extensive European contact began so late in the country's history, the traditional social structure carried over into modern times with little change. French rule brought legal prohibitions against slavery, and an end to interclan warfare. During the colonial period, the population remained nomadic, but many sedentary peoples, whose ancestors had been expelled centuries earlier, began to trickle back into Mauritania. As the country gained independence in 1960, the capital city Nouakchott was founded at the site of a small colonial village, the Ksar, while 90% of the population was still nomadic. Early history The prehistory of the west Saharan region is not fully characterised. There are some written accounts by medieval Arab traders and explorers who reached the important caravan trading centers and Sudanic kingdoms of eastern Mauritania, but the major sources of pre-European history are oral history, legends, and archaeological evidence. These sources indicate that during the millennia preceding the Christian Era, the Sahara was a more habitable region than it is today and supported a flourishing culture. In the area that is now Mauritania, the Bafour, a proto-Berber people, whose descendants may be the coastal Imraguen fishermen, were hunters, pastoralists, and fishermen. Valley cultivators, who may have been black ancestors of the riverine Toucouleur and Wolof peoples, lived alongside the Bafour. Dhar Tichitt is the oldest surviving archaeological settlements in West Africa and the oldest of all stone base settlements south of the Sahara. It was built by the Soninke people (or by the SerersGravrand, Henry, La Civilisation Sereer - Pangool, Les Nouvelles Editions Africaines du Senegal (1990), pp 9, 20, 77, ) and is thought to be the precursor of the Ghana empire, thought to have been built by Wolof people or Wolof-related ancestors. It was being settled around 2000 BCE.Fage, J.D(1976). The Cambridge history of Africa, Volume 5. Cambridge University Press: pp. 338,339 , .Coquery-Vidrovitch, Catherine. The History of African Cities South of the Sahara. Princeton: Markus Wiener Publishers, 2005, pp. 42,43 Climatic changes, and perhaps overgrazing, led to a gradual desiccation of the Sahara and the southward movement of these peoples.Warner, Rachel. \\"Early history\\". In Handloff. The Romans did some expeditions south of their Mauretania Tingitana, perhaps reaching the area north of the river Senegal populated by the Pharusii tribe.Pharusii tribe In the 3rd and 4th centuries, this southward migration from the southern Atlas region was intensified by the arrival of Berber groups from the north who were searching for pasturage or fleeing political anarchy and war. The wide-ranging activities of these turbulent Berber warriors were made possible by the introduction of the camel to the Sahara in this period. This first wave of Berber invaders subjugated and made vassals of those Bafour who did not flee south. Other Berber groups followed in the 7th and 8th centuries, themselves fleeing in large numbers before the Arab conquerors of the Maghreb. Arab invasions Beginning with the Arab conquest of the western Maghreb in the 8th century, Mauritania experienced a slow but constant infiltration of Arabs and Arab influence from the north. The growing Arab presence pressed the Berbers, who chose not to mix with other groups, to move farther south into Mauritania, forcing out the black inhabitants. By the 16th century, most blacks had been pushed to the S√©n√©gal River. Those remaining in the north became slaves cultivating the oases.Warner, Rachel. \\"Arab invasions\\". In Handloff. After the decline of the Almoravid Empire, a long process of Arabization began in Mauritania, one that until then had been resisted successfully by the Berbers. Several groups of Yemeni Arabs who had been in the north of Africa turned south to Mauritania. Settling in northern Mauritania, they disrupted the caravan trade, causing routes to shift east, which in turn led to the gradual decline of Mauritania's trading towns. One particular Yemeni group, the Bani Hassan, continued to migrate southward until, by the end of the 17th century, they dominated the entire country. The last effort of the Berbers to shake off the Arab yoke was the Mauritanian Thirty Years' War (1644‚Äì74), or Sharr Bubba, led by Nasr ad-Din, a Lemtuna imam. This Sanhadja war of liberation was, however, unsuccessful; the Berbers were forced to abandon the sword and became vassals to the warrior Arab groups. Thus, the contemporary social structure of Mauritania can be dated from 1674. The warrior groups or Arabs dominated the Berber groups, who turned to clericalism to regain a degree of ascendancy. At the bottom of the social structure were the slaves, subservient to both warriors and Islamic holy men. All of these groups, whose language was Hassaniya Arabic, became known as Maures. The bitter rivalries and resentments characteristic of their social structure were later fully exploited by the French. Sanhadja Confederation One of the Berber groups arriving in Mauritania in the 8th century was the Lemtuna. By the 9th century, the Lemtuna had attained political dominance in the Adrar and Hodh regions. Together with two other important Berber groups, the Messufa and the Godala, they set up the Sanhadja Confederation. From their capital, Aoudaghast, the Lemtuna controlled this loose confederation and the western routes of the Saharan caravan trade that had begun to flourish after the introduction of the camel. At its height, from the eighth to the end of the 10th century, the Sanhadja Confederation was a decentralized polity based on two distinct groups: the nomadic and very independent Berber groups, who maintained their traditional religions, and the Muslim, urban Berber merchants, who conducted the caravan trade.Warner, Rachel. \\"Sanhadja Confederation\\". In Handloff. Although dominated by the Sanhadja merchants, the caravan trade had its northern terminus in the Maghribi commercial city of Sijilmasa and its southern terminus in Koumbi Saleh, capital of the Ghana Empire. Later, the southern trade route ended in Timbuktu, capital of the Mali Empire. Gold, ivory, and slaves were carried north in return for salt (ancient salt mines near Kediet Ijill in northern Mauritania are still being worked), copper, cloth, and other luxury goods. Important towns developed along the trade routes. The easiest, though not the shortest, routes between Ghana and Sijilmasa were from Koumbi Saleh through Aoudaghast, Oual√¢ta, T√Æch√Æt, and Ouadane. These towns along the route grew to be important commercial as well as political centers. The 11th-century Arab chronicler Al-Bakri describes Aoudaghast, with its population of 5,000 to 6,000, as a big town with a large mosque and several smaller ones, surrounded by large cultivated areas under irrigation. Oual√¢ta was a major relay point on the gold and salt trade route, as well as a chief assembly point for pilgrims traveling to Mecca. Koumbi Saleh was a large cosmopolitan city comprising two distinct sections: the Muslim quarter, with its Arab-influenced architecture, and the black quarter of traditional thatch and mud architecture, where the non-Muslim king of Ghana resided. Another important Mauritanian trade city of the Sanhadja Confederation was Chinguetti, later an important religious center. Although Koumbi Saleh did not outlive the fall of the Ghana Empire, Aoudaghast and particularly Oual√¢ta maintained their importance well into the 16th century, when trade began shifting to the European-controlled coasts. Almoravids By the 11th century, Islam had spread throughout the west Sahara under the influence of Berber and Arab traders and occasional Arab migrants. Nevertheless, traditional religious practices thrived. The conquest of the entire west Saharan region by the Almoravids in the 11th century made possible a more orthodox Islamization of all the peoples of Mauritania.Warner, Rachel. \\"Almoravids\\". In Handloff. The breakup of the Sanhadja Confederation in the early 11th century led to a period of unrest and warfare among the Sanhadja Berber groups of Mauritania. In about 1039, a chief of the Godala, Yahya ibn Ibrahim, returned from a pilgrimage to Mecca bringing with him a Sanhadja theologian, Abdallah ibn Yassin, to teach a more orthodox Islam. Rejected by the Godala two years later, after the death of Ibn Ibrahim, Ibn Yassin and some of his Sanhadja followers retired to a secluded place where they built a fortified religious center, a ribat, which attracted many Sanhadja. In 1042 the al murabitun (men of the ribat), as Ibn Yassin's followers came to be called, launched a jihad, or holy war, against the nonbelievers and the heretics among the Sanhadja, beginning what later become known as the Almoravid movement. The initial aim of the Almoravids was to establish a political community in which the ethical and juridical principles of Islam would be strictly applied. First, the Almoravids attacked and subdued the Godala, forcing them to acknowledge Islam. Then, rallying the other Berber groups of the west Sahara, the Almoravids succeeded in recreating the political unity of the Sanhadja Confederation and adding to it a religious unity and purpose. By 1054 the Almoravids had captured Sijilmasa in the Maghrib and had retaken Aoudaghast from Ghana. With the death of Ibn Yassin in 1059, leadership of the movement in the south passed to Abu-Bakr Ibn-Umar, amir of Adrar, and to Yusuf ibn Tashfin in the north. Under Ibn Tashfin, the Berbers captured Morocco and founded Marrakech as their capital in 1062. By 1082 all of the western Maghrib (to at least present-day Algiers) was under Almoravid domination. In 1086 the Andalusian emirates, under attack from the Spanish Christian king Alfonso and the Christian reconquest of Spain, called on Ibn Tashfin and his Berber warriors to cross the Strait of Gibraltar and come to their rescue. The Almoravids defeated the Spanish Christians and, by 1090, imposed Almoravid rule and the Maliki school of Islamic law in Muslim Spain. In Mauritania, Abu Bakr led the Almoravids in a war against Ghana (1062‚Äì76), culminating in the capture in 1076 of Koumbi Saleh. This event marked the end of the dominance of the Ghana Empire. But after the death of Abu Bakr in 1087 and Ibn Tashfin in 1106, traditional rivalries among the Sanhadja and a new Muslim reformist conquest led by the Zenata Almohads (1133‚Äì63) destroyed the Almoravid Empire. For a short time, the Mauritanian Sanhadja dynasty of the Almoravid Empire controlled a vast territory stretching from Spain to Senegal. The unity established between Morocco and Mauritania during the Almoravid period continued to have some political importance in the 1980s, as it formed part of the basis for Morocco's claims to Mauritania. But the greatest contribution of the Sanhadja and the Almoravids was the Islamization of the western Maghrib. This process would remain a dominant factor in the history of the area for the next several centuries. Sudanic empires and kingdoms Although the Almoravids had substantial contacts with the Maghrib, influences from the black Sudanic kingdoms of Ghana, Mali, and Songhai played an important role in Mauritania's history for about 700 years‚Äîfrom the 8th to the 15th century. Ghana, the first of the great West African Sudanic kingdoms, included in its territory all of southeastern Mauritania extending to Tagant. Ghana reached its apogee in the 9th and 10th centuries with the extension of its rule over the Sanhadja Berbers. This large and centralized kingdom controlled the southern terminus of the trans-Saharan trade in gold, ivory, and salt.Warner, Rachel. \\"Sudanic empires and kingdoms\\". In Handloff. The capture of Koumbi Saleh in 1076 by the Almoravids marked the end of Ghana's hegemony, although the kingdom continued to exist for another 125 years. The Mand√©, under the leadership of the legendary Sundiata, founded the second great Sudanic kingdom, Mali. By the end of the 13th century, the Mali Empire extended over that part of Mauritania previously controlled by Ghana, as well as over the remaining Sahelian regions and the Senegal River Valley. Sundiata and his successors took over Ghana's role in the Saharan trade and in the administration and collection of tribute from vast stretches of the Sudan and the Sahel. The slow decline of the Mali Empire that started at the end of the 14th century came about through internal discord and revolts by the inhabitants of vassal states, including the Songhai of Gao. By the end of the 15th century, the Songhai Empire had replaced the Mali Empire and extended to Mauritania and the upper Senegal River Valley. At the end of the 16th century, a large Moroccan force defeated the Songhai, bringing to an end the seven centuries of domination of the western Sudan (and a large part of Mauritania) by strong, centralized black kingdoms. Early European involvement Despite the Almoravid domination of Spain in the 11th and 12th centuries, there seems to be little evidence of contact during that time between Mauritania and Europe. The inhospitable coastline of Mauritania continued to deter voyagers until the Portuguese began their African explorations in the 15th century. The area of Mauritania was of little interest to either Arab or European conquerors; the existence of gold reserves in the interior was not yet known, and the important trade routes passed the territory well to the east, through Timbuktu. The Saadi dynasty conquered much of the Saharan interior but did not show interest in expanding their territory westward. The Portuguese had established a trading fort at Arguin, southeast of Cap Blanc (present-day Ras Nouadhibou), in 1455. The king of Portugal also maintained a commercial agent at Ouadane in the Adrar in an attempt to divert gold traveling north by caravan. Having only slight success in their quest for gold, the Portuguese quickly adapted to dealing in slaves. In the mid-15th century, as many as 1,000 slaves per year were exported from Arguin to Europe and to the Portuguese sugar plantations on the island of Sao Tom√© in the Gulf of Guinea.Warner, Rachel. \\"Early European contacts\\". In Handloff. With the merger of the Portuguese and Spanish crowns in 1580, the Spaniards became the dominant influence along the coast. In 1638, however, they were replaced by the Dutch, who were the first to begin exploiting the gum arabic trade. Produced by the acacia trees of Trarza and Brakna and used in textile pattern printing, this gum arabic was considered superior to that previously obtained in Arabia. By 1678 the French had driven out the Dutch and established a permanent settlement at Saint-Louis at the mouth of the Senegal River, where the French Compagnie du S√©n√©gal had been trading for more than fifty years. The Maures, with whom the Europeans were trading, considered the constant rivalries between European powers a sign of weakness, and they quickly learned the benefits of playing one power against the other. For example, they agreed simultaneously to give monopolies to the French and the Dutch. The Maures also took advantage of the Europeans whenever possible, so that when the French negotiated with the emir of Trarza to secure a monopoly on the gum arabic trade, the amir in exchange demanded a considerable number of gifts. Thus began the coutume, an annual payment expected by the Maures for doing business with a government or a company. By 1763 the British had expelled France from the West African coast, and France recovered control only when the Congress of Vienna in 1815 recognized French sovereignty over the coast of West Africa from Cap Blanc south to Senegal.

The nanomorphic cell concept is inspired by the trend, synergistic with semiconductor device scaling; to use these core technologies for diverse integrated system applications.

The multifunctional microsystems becomes morphic (literally means in the shape of ) because its architecture are defined by the specific application and the fundamental limits on volumetric system parameters. The nanomorphic cell model was applied to analyze the capabilities of an autonomous integrated microsystem on the order of the size of a living cell, i.e. a cube of 10 micrometer on a side [1, 2]. The function of this microsystem is, for example, upon injection into the body, to interact with living cells, e.g. determine the state of the cell and to support certain ‚Äútherapeutic‚Äù action.

Early relationship with Europe Before the nineteenth century, the European powers in West Africa were interested only in coastal trade; they attempted no important inland exploration and established no permanent settlements (except Saint-Louis). The European mercantile companies on the coast were charged with making the highest possible profit. Four such French companies enjoyed an official French-government monopoly of the Senegal River trade from 1659 to 1798. Contact with the Maures and the black inhabitants of the valley came about only in the course of trade. From the beginning, French influence, competing with traditional trading partners north and east of Mauritania, came through Senegal.Warner, Rachel. \\"French Colonial Administration\\". In Handloff. In 1825 the new Emir of Trarza, Muhammad al Habib, sought to reassert his sovereignty over the French-protected Oualo Kingdom to the south of the Senegal River by marrying the heiress to the kingdom. This action, which French authorities viewed as a hostile threat, combined with the emir's efforts to sell gum arabic to the British, brought a strong French reaction. Although the Maures were able to lay siege to Saint- Louis, a large French expeditionary force defeated the emir's forces. The French concluded that to secure the continuing profitability of the gum arabic trade, they would have to forcibly occupy the northern bank of the Senegal River. thumb Implementing this new policy was Louis Faidherbe, the French governor of Senegal from 1854 to 1861 and from 1863 to 1865. In 1840 a French ordinance had established Senegal as a permanent French possession with a government whose jurisdiction extended over all settlements then effectively under French control, including those in Mauritania. By undertaking the governance of these Mauritanian settlements, French rulers directly challenged Maure claims of sovereignty. Under orders from the new government of Louis Napoleon to end the coutume, to secure the gum arabic trade, and to protect the sedentary populations of the southern bank from Maure raids, Faidherbe conquered the Oualo Kingdom. He then turned his attention to the amirates of Trarza and Brakna that had united against him. The Maures attacked Saint Louis in 1855 and almost succeeded in reclaiming the settlement, but they were repulsed and defeated a year later, north of the Senegal River. The treaties ending the war extended a French protectorate over Trarza and Brakna, replaced the coutume with a 3 percent annual rebate on the value of gum arabic delivered, and recognized French sovereignty over the northern bank of the Senegal River. In addition to his military ventures, Faidherbe sponsored an active program to undertake geographic studies and establish political and commercial ties. In 1859 and 1860, Faidherbe sponsored five expeditions, including one that mapped the Adrar, to all areas of western and southern Mauritania. Faidherbe's successors were content to maintain his gains and did not embark on further military ventures. French colonial policy at this time can best be characterized by the warning given by the Colonial Ministry to the governor of Senegal in the late 1870s: \\"Let us not hear from you.\\" With France's virtual abandonment of Senegal, the relative calm created in the Chemama and southern Mauritania through Faidherbe's efforts came to an end. The Maures resumed their traditional practices of internecine warfare and pillaging villages in the Chemama. In virtual control of the colonial administration, the commercial companies of Saint-Louis sold arms to the Maures, while at the same time outfitting French punitive missions. Scientific expeditions into Mauritania became increasingly subject to attack, and their European leaders were killed or held for ransom. The obvious weakness of the French and their distraction with events elsewhere in the region emboldened the amirs to demand and secure the reinstatement of the coutume. At the beginning of the twentieth century, after 250 years of French presence in Mauritania, the situation was little changed. The endemic warfare between different Maure groups may even have increased as French merchants made arms readily available, and colonial forces defended camps north of the Senegal River against Maure pillagers. Though formally under the \\"protection\\" of the French, the Maures were as fiercely independent as ever. Pacification In 1901 the French government adopted a plan of \\"peaceful penetration\\" for the administrative organization of areas then under Maure suzerainty. The plan's author was Xavier Coppolani, a Corsican brought up in Algeria, who was sent to Mauritania as a delegate from the French government. Coppolani set up a policy not only to divide, weaken, and pacify the Maures but also to protect them. Although he served in Mauritania for only four years (1901‚Äì05), the French called Coppolani the father of the French colony of Mauritania, and the Maures knew him as the \\"Pacific Conqueror\\" of the territory.Warner, Rachel. \\"Pacification\\". In Handloff. During this period, there were three marabouts of great influence in Mauritania: Shaykh Sidiya Baba, whose authority was strongest in Trarza, Brakna, and Tagant; Shaykh Saad Bu, whose importance extended to Tagant and Senegal; and Shaykh Ma al Aynin, who exerted leadership in Adrar and the north, as well as in Spanish Sahara and southern Morocco. By enlisting the support of Shaykh Sidiya and Shaykh Saad against the depredations of the warrior clans and in favor of a Pax Gallica, Coppolani was able to exploit the fundamental conflicts in Maure society. His task was made difficult by opposition from the administration in Senegal, which saw no value in the wastelands north of the Senegal River, and by the Saint-Louis commercial companies, to whom pacification meant the end of the lucrative arms trade. Nevertheless, by 1904 Coppolani had peacefully subdued Trarza, Brakna, and Tagant and had established French military posts across the central region of southern Mauritania. As Faidherbe had suggested fifty years earlier, the key to the pacification of Mauritania lay in the Adrar. There, Shaykh Ma al Aynin had begun a campaign to counteract the influence of his two rivals‚Äîthe southern marabouts, Shaykh Sidiya and Shaykh Saad‚Äîand to stop the advance of the French. Because Shaykh Ma al Aynin enjoyed military as well as moral support from Morocco, the policy of peaceful pacification gave way to active conquest. In return for support, Shaykh Ma al Aynin recognized the Moroccan sultan's claims to sovereignty over Mauritania, which formed the basis for much of Morocco's claim to Mauritania in the late twentieth century. In May 1905, before the French column could set out for Adrar, Coppolani was killed in Tidjikdja. upright With the death of Coppolani, the tide turned in favor of Shaykh Ma al Aynin, who was able to rally many of the Maures with promises of Moroccan help. The French government hesitated for three years while Shaykh Ma al Aynin urged a jihad to drive the French back across the Senegal. In 1908 Colonel Henri Gouraud, who had defeated a resistance movement in the French Sudan (present-day Mali), took command of French forces as the government commissioner of the new Civil Territory of Mauritania (created in 1904), captured Atar, and received the submission of all the Adrar peoples the following year. By 1912 all resistance in Adrar and southern Mauritania had been put down. As a result of the conquest of Adrar, the fighting ability of the French was established, and the ascendancy of the French-supported marabouts over the warrior clans within Maure society was assured. The fighting took a large toll on the animal herds of the nomadic Maures, who sought to replenish their herds in the traditional manner‚Äîby raiding other camps. From 1912 to 1934, French security forces repeatedly thwarted such raids. The last raid of the particularly troublesome and far-ranging northern nomads, the Reguibat, occurred in 1934, covered a distance of 6,000 kilometers, and netted 800 head of cattle, 270 camels, and 10 slaves. Yet, except for minor raids and occasional attacks‚ÄîPort-Etienne (present-day Nouadhibou) was attacked in 1924 and 1927‚Äîthe Maures generally acquiesced to French authority. With pacification, the French acquired responsibility for governing the vast territory of Mauritania. French colonial policy From the time of the French Revolution in 1789, the two main characteristics of French colonial policy in West Africa were the quest for international prestige and the cultural assimilation of indigenous populations. France's efforts to build a colonial empire may be considered a reaction to British imperial successes: colonies were a necessary burden the French took on to maintain their international stature. These efforts were always subordinate to the considerations of continental politics. As a result, little attention was paid to the political, social, and economic development of the overseas territories.Warner, Rachel. \\"French Colonial Policy\\". In Handloff. The policy of assimilation had its origins in the French Revolution when the National Convention in 1794 declared that all people living in the colonies were French citizens and enjoyed all republican rights. Under Napoleon and the Consulate (1799‚Äì1804), the law was soon repealed. In 1848, at the outset of the Second Republic, citizenship rights were again extended, and representation in the National Assembly was provided for the four communes of Senegal (Saint-Louis, Dakar, Rufisque, and Gor√©e). Although these rights were retained by the Senegalese, they did not apply to Mauritania or other French territories in West Africa. Elsewhere in West Africa, although assimilation was the theoretical basis of administration, a policy evolved that shared elements of British colonial practice. For example, Africans were subjects of France, not citizens, and had no political rights or rights of representation. The centralized and direct administration embodied in the doctrine of assimilation was maintained, however, and a functional collaboration between French rulers and an assimilated indigenous elite developed. Although by World War II colonial policy was still labeled assimilationist, only a very few Africans were assimilated. For the majority of Africans, the realities of French colonial policy were far from the spirit of French egalitarianism. French administration through World War II Mauritania, a long-time appendage of Senegal, was not considered worth the expense necessary to pacify and develop it until Coppolani succeeded in changing the attitude of the French government. In 1904 France recognized Mauritania as an entity separate from Senegal and organized it as a French protectorate under a delegate general in Saint-Louis. With the success of the first pacification attempts, the status of Mauritania was upgraded to that of a civil territory administered by a commissioner of government (first Coppolani, later Gouraud). Although formally separate from French West Africa (Afrique Occidentale Fran√ßaise‚ÄîAOF), which had been created in 1895, Mauritania was closely tied to its administrative structure and had its annual budget appended to that of the AOF. On December 4, 1920, by a decree of the Colonial Ministry in Paris, Mauritania was officially included in the AOF with the six other French West African territories--Senegal, the French Sudan, Guinea, C√¥te d'Ivoire, Dahomey (present-day Benin), and Niger.Warner, Rachel. \\"French Administration Through World War II\\". In Handloff. The AOF was organized pyramidally under a centralized federal structure in Dakar. Directly appointed by the president of the French Republic, the governor general of the AOF came to have a great deal of power because of the instability and short duration of Third Republic governments in Paris. The governor general was the head of centralized administrative bureaucracy consisting of a lieutenant governor for each territory, the commandant of a cercle (a colonial administrative subdivision), and chiefs of subdivisions, cantons, and villages. The key figure in the system was the commandant in each cercle, who was almost always a European and who was closest to the indigenous population in his duties of collecting taxes, overseeing works projects, maintaining peace and security, and carrying out administrative decrees. Generally, the subdivisions subordinate to the commandant were manned by Africans. For these positions, the French relied to a great extent on the traditional hierarchy of chiefs or their sons. In keeping with their policy of direct, centralized rule, the French made it clear that these African chiefs exercised authority not by virtue of their traditional position but by virtue of their status as modern colonial administrators. Before 1946 no legislative bodies existed in the AOF. The governor general was assisted by the Grand Council in Dakar, Senegal, which since 1925 had represented the federation's major interest groups (military personnel, civil servants, and businessmen). But the council had only consultative status, and its members were all appointed by the governor general. Similar administrative councils advised the lieutenant governors in all of the territories except Mauritania and Niger. Mauritania's administrative structure conformed generally with that of the rest of the AOF territories. There were, however, some very important differences. Unlike the other territories (with the possible exception of Niger), most of the cercles still had military commandants because of the late date of the territory's pacification. The resultant conflicts between military and civilian authorities caused frequent administrative changes and reorganizations, including shifts in boundaries that tended to create confusion. The importance of the role of the traditional Maure chiefs in the administration was the most significant difference between Mauritania and the other AOF territories and has probably had the greatest continuing impact. The extent to which administrative practice in Mauritania contradicted the French policy of direct rule and resembled British indirect rule is noteworthy. From the time of Coppolani, the administration had relied heavily on the marabouts for support and administration. In recognition of the support given by Shaykh Sidiya of Trarza, the French placed the school of Islamic studies at Boutilimit under his control. Traditional administrators of Islamic justice, the qadis, were put on the French payroll without supervision, and administrative appointments of chiefs were subject to the approval of the traditional jamaa. In an effort to maintain order throughout the turbulent territory, the French co-opted the leaders of certain warrior groups to serve the administration. Notable among these were the amirs of Trarza, Brakna, and Adrar, the three most powerful men in the colony, who were aided by 50 heads of smaller groups and the more than 800 chiefs of factions and sub-factions. Although there was extensive French interference in the operations of the traditional authorities, the traditional social structure of Mauritania was maintained and thrust into the modern world. With the outbreak of World War II in 1939, France's African territories were called upon to supply troops and provisions for the war effort. After France fell in 1940, the Vichy government gained control of the AOF and replaced the official policy of assimilation with a policy of racial discrimination in shops, trains, and hotels. Existing democratic institutions were repressed, and the administrative councils were abolished. Elements of French colonial policy, such as the indig√©nat and forced labor, were abused. The chiefs, on whom the Vichy government in Dakar relied, were increasingly seen as collaborators by their people as war-related demands for agricultural production and forced labor besieged them. Sporadic resistance to these abuses was met with summary punishment. In recognition of the suffering of the people of the AOF territories during the war and of the AOF's contribution to the war effort of the Free French (at one time more than half the Free French forces were Africans), Free French officials convened a conference in Brazzaville, Congo, in June 1944 to propose postwar reforms of the colonial administration. The conference favored greater administrative freedom in each colony, combined with the maintenance of unity through a federal constitution. It also recommended the abolition of the indig√©nat and forced labor, the establishment of trade unions, the rapid extension of education, and the granting of universal suffrage. The conference was firmly opposed, however, to any concept of evolution outside the French bloc and called for the full application of the assimilationist doctrine. The Brazzaville Conference was the beginning of great political and social change that was to sweep Mauritania and other French African States to independence in less than seventeen years. Postwar reforms Only slightly developed and long neglected, Mauritania played no role in the rising nationalism in the AOF after World War II. The 1946 constitution of the French Fourth Republic established the former colonies of the AOF as overseas territories of France integrally tied to the French Union. The French administration in Saint-Louis retained jurisdiction in criminal law, public freedoms, and political and administrative organization; the Colonial Ministry could still rule by decree, if the decree did not violate a statute. The indig√©nat and forced labor were abolished, and French citizenship was extended to all inhabitants of French territories willing to renounce their local legal status.Warner, Rachel. \\"Postwar Reforms\\". In Handloff. Elective representation existed on three levels: territorial, federation (AOF), and national (French). A General Council (renamed Territorial Assembly in 1952) was established in each territory with extensive controls over the budget, but with only consultative powers over all other issues. The Mauritanian General Council comprised twenty-four members, eight elected by Europeans and sixteen elected by Mauritanians. Each territory had five representatives, elected from its General Council, on the AOF's Grand Council in Dakar, Senegal, which had general authority over budgeting, politics, administration, planning, and other matters for all of the AOF. Each territory also sent representatives to the National Assembly, the Council of the Republic, and the Assembly of the French Union in Paris. The franchise created by the 1946 French constitution was small and restricted to government officials, wage earners, veterans, owners of registered property, and members or former members of local associations, cooperatives, or trade unions. Consequently, in the Mauritanian elections of 1946, there were fewer than 10,000 qualified voters. In 1947 individuals literate in French and Arabic were added to the electorate, and in 1951 heads of households and mothers of two children were made eligible. By 1956 suffrage had become universal. Before 1946 the territory of Mauritania formed one electoral unit with Senegal, which was represented by a single senator in the French Senate. The 1946 constitution, however, separated Mauritania from Senegal politically, giving it a deputy to the French National Assembly. At the same time, the bicameral General Council, which was reorganized into the unicameral Territorial Assembly in 1952, was established in Mauritania. Nonetheless, political activity in Mauritania was minimal. The territory's first party, the Mauritanian Entente, was headed by Horma Ould Babana, who served as the first Mauritanian deputy to the French National Assembly. The Mauritanian Entente was founded in 1946 under the auspices of Leopold Senghor and Lamine Gueye of the Senegalese section of the French Socialist Party. Formed specifically for the 1946 election, the Mauritanian Entente was neither well organized nor mass based. Yet on a platform calling for movement toward independence and elimination of chiefdoms, Babana easily defeated the candidate of the conservative French administration and the leading clerics. The new deputy, however, spent most of his five-year term in Paris, out of contact with politics in Mauritania. As a result, on his return for the 1951 elections, Babana was defeated by the Mauritanian Progressive Union, led by Sidi el Moktar N'Diaye and supported by the colonial administration and its allies, the traditional Maure secular and clerical ruling classes, who feared the Mauritanian Entente's \\"socialist\\" program. In the 1952 election for members of the Territorial Assembly, the Mauritanian Progressive Union won the twenty-two of the twenty-four seats. The reforms of 1956, or Loi-Cadre, were even more sweeping than those of 1946. In the face of growing nationalism and the development of a political consciousness in the AOF, the Loi-Cadre ended the integrationist phase of French colonial policy and bestowed a considerable degree of internal autonomy on the overseas territories. Universal suffrage and the elimination of the dual college electoral system led to the creation of district and local representative councils and a great enlargement of the powers of the territorial assemblies. Each territory could now formulate its own domestic policies, although the territories continued to rely on France for decisions concerning foreign affairs, defense, higher education, and economic aid. The most important provision of the 1956 Loi-Cadre was the establishment of a council of government to assume the major executive functions of each territory that until that time had been carried out by a Paris-appointed colonial official. The councils were composed of three to six ministers elected by the territorial assemblies on the advice of the dominant party. Each minister was charged with overseeing a functional department of government. The head of the ministers became vice president of the council and, in effect, if not in title, prime minister. In Mauritania, that person was Moktar Ould Daddah, the country's only lawyer and a member of a prominent pro-French clerical family. Road to independence and the quest for national unity Mauritania's first government was invested in May 1957 and symbolically chose as its new capital Nouakchott, which by design was situated almost exactly between the Senegal River Valley, populated primarily by black farmers, and the Maure stronghold in Adrar. The choice represented a compromise between these two competing areas. It also set the tone for Daddah's approach to Mauritania's political conflicts: compromise and conciliation for the sake of national unity.Warner, Rachel. \\"The Road to Independence and the Quest for National Unity\\". In Handloff. The greatest challenge to national unity was Mauritania's heterogeneous population. As in all the Sahelian states, Mauritania's southern regions were inhabited mainly by peasants who belonged racially and culturally to black Africa, while the population of its northern regions were desert nomads who identified with the Arab world. At independence, Mauritania's estimated 1.5 to 1.8 million people could be divided into three groups: one-third of the inhabitants were both racially and ethnically Maures; another third, although racially black or mixed Maure-black, were ethnically Maures (this group of black Maures was essentially a slave class until 1980, when slavery was abolished); and the remaining third were racially and ethnically black, resembling in many respects the populations in neighboring Senegal and Mali. Achievement of national unity was impeded by the desires of some Maures, mostly from the northern sections of the country, to unite with Morocco, and the countervailing wishes of many blacks to secede from Mauritania and join the Mali Federation. The defeat of the Mauritanian Entente and Babana by the Mauritanian Progressive Union in the elections of 1951 and 1956, which established the Mauritanian Progressive Union's dominance, led Babana and several of his followers in the summer of 1956 to flee to Morocco, where Babana became head of the National Council of Mauritanian Resistance. With the support of many Maures inside Mauritania, this group supported Morocco's claims to Mauritania and, by extension, Morocco's opposition to Mauritanian independence. To counterbalance the pro-Moroccan sympathies of many Maures, southern minority groups formed a regional party, the Gorgol Democratic Bloc, committed to the prevention of a Maghribi union and to the maintenance of close ties with black African countries. Intellectuals from various black minorities met in Dakar, Senegal, in 1957 and created the Union of the Inhabitants of the River Valley to fight for minority rights against Maure domination. Further impeding national unity was the inclusion of French officials in the key ministries of finance and economic planning. Daddah was educated in France and, having just returned to Mauritania to form the government, had not been involved in the rivalries and struggle for power. His consequent congeniality toward the French alienated the Association of Mauritanian Youth, an important group advocated total independence and strict anticolonialism. In this atmosphere of increasing fragmentation and political instability, Daddah, with the strong support of France, called for unity among all factions. At the Congress of Aleg in May 1958, the Mauritanian Regroupment Party was formed in a merger of the Mauritanian Progressive Union, elements of the Mauritanian Entente that had expelled Babana, and the Gorgol Democratic Bloc. This party was headed by Daddah as secretary general and Sidi el Moktar as president. Its platform called for Mauritania to join the French Community (francophone Africa) and to reject both Morocco's claim to Mauritania and a 1957 French proposal to unite Mauritania with francophone Saharan states in the joint Frenchdominated Common Saharan States Organization. The platform also proposed the systematic organization within the country of local party committees to involve all sectors of the population in the party. The party's program reflected the three main themes of Mauritanian unity: the rejection of federation with Mali or Morocco under any terms, the principle of balance between Maures and blacks within the party and government, and the preeminence of Daddah as the only person capable of holding the country together. The Mauritarian Regroupment Party represented a union of modern and traditional elements as well as a balance between north and south. The dominance of traditional elements favoring close ties with France led, however, to the end of unity. Progressive youth leaders, excluded from decision making at the party congress convened at Nouakchott in July 1958, defected and formed a new opposition party, the Mauritanian National Renaissance Party (Nahda) with Ahmed Baba Misk√© as secretary general. The Nahda platform called for total and immediate independence from France and a rapprochement with Morocco. Although the program was designed to rally diverse opposition to the traditional Mauritanian Regroupment Party, the call for rapprochement with Morocco caused Nahda's opponents to label it a Maure party, which cost it the support of the black minorities. But former Mauritanian Entente members, including Babana, supported Nahda. Its anticolonial nationalist platform also attracted many young Maures.

The project started as an evolution of the Beretta AR 70/90 and Beretta SC 70/90 and was initially presented as a simple update of the construction materials and addition of small changes to the Beretta AR 70/90. Later a more elaborate prototype was then introduced, which introduced a stock that was not foldable but adjustable in length and the cocking lever in the upper front position, a feature however not comfortable during use. Subsequent developments led to the definitive version of the ARX-160, which is currently in production and has supplanted all the three versions its predecessor, the AR 70/90. The Italian Army ordered a first batch of 800 weapons in 2008 for field trials in Afghanistan, which was followed by orders for 11 500 units in 2010 and 10 000 in 2012. Between 2008 and 2014, there were around 30,000 ARX160 A2s that are chambered in 5.56√ó45mm NATO cartridge that have been supplied to the Italian Army, Italian Navy, Italian Air Force and Italian Special Forces. In 2012, Beretta introduced the 7.62√ó39mm configuration of the ARX160, and on the same year Beretta also introduced the ARX160 A2 which is currently in use with the Italian Army and Special Forces. In 2013, Beretta introduced the ARX160 A3, which is an improved variant of the ARX160. The improvements includes a redesigned handguard with an improved heat ventilation and an extended Picatinny rail on its bottom, and an improved pistol grip design. In 2014, the Italian Ministry of Defence allocated 2.7 million USD to Beretta for the development of the ARX200 battle rifle. Also, the Italian Armed Forces has announced a possible requirement for 1,170 rifles chambered in 7.62√ó51mm NATO cartridge. In late 2015, the Beretta ARX200 battle rifle was introduced and is being supplied to the Italian Army. It is a distant derivative of the ARX160 modular assault rifle. It has passed the following military and environmental tests; cold and hot temperature, temperature and humidity, ice, salt fog, heavy rain, salt water, sand and dust, mud, unlubricated, double feeding proof, and barrel obstruction proof.Beretta Displays New CSASS in 7.62mm - Kitup.Military.com, 29 September 2016 =Foreign interest= Italian alt= The Beretta ARX160 was one of the five Phase II contenders in the United States Army Individual Carbine competition to replace the M4 carbine.The Army‚Äôs Next Generation Carbine - Cheaperthandirt.com, May 19, 2012 The Individual Carbine competition was cancelled before a winning weapon was chosen.Army Kills Competition to Replace M4 - Military.com, 13 June 2013 In February 2013, the Argentine Army received an ARX160 rifle and GLX160 grenade launcher for evaluation for their special forces.Argentinean Special Forces Evaluating Beretta ARX 160 - Thefirearmblog.com, February 6, 2013 In December 2016, state-owned Argentine arms manufacturer Fabricaciones Militares signed a deal with Beretta to produce the ARX200 under license.

The ARX160 A3 was one of the 5 finalists of the French Army tender to replace the FAMAS, eventually won by the German-made HK416. In January 2019, the Romanian Armed Forces have chosen the ARX160 A3 to replace the old PM Md.1963 (7,62 x 39 mm) and PM Md.1986 (5,45 x 39 mm) of the Romanian Land Forces. Production should start in Autumn 2019 at Uzina Plopeni of ROMARM. Design alt= alt=The Beretta ARX160 departs from the previously issued AR70/90 on several points. It is composed of an upper and lower receiver, both manufactured mostly from polymer, and operates through a short-stroke piston system. It is chambered in either 5.56√ó45mm NATO or 7.62√ó39mm cartridge. Feeding is through STANAG magazines for the 5.56√ó45mm NATO configuration and AK-47 or AKM magazines for the 7.62√ó39mm configuration. Other calibres, including 5.45√ó39mm and 6.8mm Remington SPC were planned. It features an ambidextrous safeties, magazine release (right side, left side, and \\"AK\\" style), bolt release and charging handle, as well as the ability to change which side spent casings are ejected, a quick-change barrel which can be removed and replaced in seconds without any tools, Picatinny rails, and a foldable telescopic stock. The lightweight barrel is chrome lined and manufactured by the hammer forging process at the Beretta factory in Gardone Val Trompia, Lombardy. Barrel lengths for this rifle are 16 in (40.6 cm) for its standard barrel, and a 12 in (30.48 cm) barrel for special operators. The flash hider has 5 radial cuts and 4 smaller cuts to control muzzle climb in automatic firing. Barrels have a 1:7 twist to fire NATO standard ball and tracer rounds. The non-free-floated barrel is easily removed simply by pulling on slide levers and pulling it out. A bayonet lug, designed for the Extrema Ratio Fulcrum bayonet is positioned above the barrel rather than underneath it.Italy‚Äôs Next Generation Rifle: The ARX 160 - SAdefensejournal.com, 19 August 2011 The ARX160 operating system is unique in that the piston moves almost , while other systems move fractions of an inch. The piston follows the bolt carrier almost all the way rearward, resulting in low gas pressure levels and a less sudden and more constant push on the carrier group. It has the ability to eject the empty shells out of either in the right side or left side for ambidextrous operation. The bolt has seven lugs and an extractor on the left and right, with no ejector. The extractors are spring-loaded and which way cases are ejected is selected by pressing a case through a small hole located past the port. It is small and optimised for the tip of a bullet to fit. The ejection port is open on both sides and directs shells at a 45 degree angle from the barrel. The cocking lever is on the bolt carrier and can be positioned on either side by pulling it out, swinging it through the ejection port, and pushing it in to secure it in place. It features a standard back-up iron sights that are made of the same polymer as the weapon's receiver. The front sight post is adjustable for windage and elevation and the rear peep sight has six positions to fire in increments from 100‚Äì600 meters. The primary optical sight is the Aimpoint ACIES, a domestic version of the Aimpoint CompM2. Telescopic sights, night vision systems, vertical forward grips, and other accessories will be available through the Soldato Futuro program. Variants= ARX160 = ACOG scope equipped, the buttstock folded, and the bolt assembly in full forward positionalt= alt= The Beretta ARX160 modular assault rifle that is only available for military and law enforcement use. The rifle is chambered in either 5.56√ó45mm NATO or 7.62√ó39mm cartridge. It features a Picatinny rail on the top of the receiver, and on the 3-,6-,9-o'clock position of the handguard for mounting various optics, grips and other accessories. It is worth mentioning that the Picatinny rail that is located at the 6 o'clock position is limited, Beretta does offer an extended Picatinny rail accessory to mitigate this. It has a quick change barrel feature, a barrel length of 12- and 16-inch, a folding back-up iron sights, ambidextrous fire/safety selector, magazine release, bolt release and charging handle, case ejector that can eject the empty brass either to the right side or left side by pressing on the case ejection selector with a tip of a 5.56√ó45mm NATO cartridge, and a telescopic folding buttstock that is also adjustable for length of pull. A conversion kit for 7.62√ó39mm is also available, it requires changing the barrel, bolt, lower receiver assembly and magazine in order to change the calibre. It uses the AK-47 or AKM magazines for the 7.62√ó39mm configuration and STANAG magazines for the 5.56√ó45mm NATO configuration.  ARX160 A2  The Beretta ARX160 A2, also referred to as the ARX160 SF (Special Forces) is similar to the ARX160 but features a shorter buttstock, an extended Picatinny rail on the bottom of its handguard and uses a 12-inch barrel. It was developed for the Italian special forces and was later adopted by them.  ARX160 A3  The Beretta ARX160 A3 is an improved variant of the ARX160 which features some design changes. The changes includes a redesigned handguard, where its top row air vent slits have been replaced with a larger square cut outs, though the bottom row air vent still retains the thinner slits. These larger cut outs reduces some weight of the rifle while letting more air to circulate around the barrel. It features an improved pistol grip design and a barrel length of 11- and 16-inch. = ARX100 = The Beretta ARX100 is a semi-automatic only variant of the ARX160 that is intended for the civilian market. It is chambered in 5.56√ó45mm NATO/.223 Remington cartridge. It features a Picatinny rail on the top of the receiver for mounting various optics, on both sides of the hand guard for mounting various accessories and on the bottom of the handguard for mounting various grips, a quick change barrel, a barrel length of 16-inch, a folding back-up iron sights, ambidextrous fire/safety selector, magazine release, bolt release and charging handle, a case ejector that can eject the empty brass either to the right side or left side by pressing on the case ejection selector with a tip of a 5.56√ó45mm NATO/.223 Remington cartridge, and a telescopic folding buttstock that is also adjustable for length of pull. = ARX160 22LR = The Beretta ARX160 22LR is a rimfire variant of the ARX100. It is chambered in .22 Long Rifle cartridge, making it ideal for a tactical training rifle. It features an 18.11-inch barrel for the carbine configuration and an 8.3-inch barrel for the pistol configuration, and uses a 5-, 10-, 15-, or 20-round magazine.  ARX200 derivative  The Beretta ARX200 is a derivative of the ARX160, it is chambered in 7.62√ó51mm NATO cartridge, and operates through a short-stroke gas piston system with a rotating bolt. It was introduced in late 2015, and is only available for military and law enforcement use. The ARX200 is planned to fill the gap in Italian infantry armament between the 5.56√ó45mm NATO assault rifle and large-calibre bolt-action sniper rifles, based on combat experience in Afghanistan. The Italian Armed Forces has ordered four hundred ARX200s for trials and evaluation. It's also expected that the first batch of ARX200s will be delivered by the end of 2015. They are also testing on how to introduce a battle rifle into small infantry units. Possibly 2 to 3 designated marksman rifles and battle rifles are planned for use at squad level. The Italian Army is planning to introduce two configurations of the ARX200; a battle rifle with a foldable telescoping buttstock, capable of fully automatic and semi-automatic fire. It has a cyclic rate of fire of around 600‚Äì650 rounds per minute., and a designated marksman rifle (DMR) with a fixed buttstock, that is only capable of semi-automatic fire. The battle rifle configuration is to be equipped with an interface for the Beretta GLX160 grenade launcher chambered in 40√ó46mm NATO, a foldable telescopic stock with adjustable cheek rest, shock absorber back plate and four fixed sling attachments. On the other hand, the designated marksman rifle (DMR) configuration is to be equipped with a computerised Intelligent Combat Sight (ICS) developed by Steiner Optics (a subsidiary of Beretta Defense Technologies), which integrates a laser rangefinder, an inclinometer and a ballistic calculator into a compact 6√ó40 optic. The ARX200 has three gas settings; normal, adverse and suppressed firing. It features a fully ambidextrous controls that includes the bolt catch lever, magazine release button and fire selector. Unlike the ARX160, it lacks the capability to change which side the empty shells are ejected. However, the charging handle remains reversible and can be switched from the right- to left-side of the upper receiver and the barrel locking bolt is located in front of the magazine well. It is equipped with a quick-change, free-floating, cold hammer-forged barrel which can be removed and replaced in a minute using one wrench. It has a weight of 4.5 kg without a magazine and unloaded, a length of 730 mm with the stock folded, 890 mm with the stock collapsed and 1,000 mm with the stock extended, a 406 mm (16 in) heavy barrel (excluding the flash hider) with match-grade rifling with four right-hand grooves and a 279 mm (11 in) twist rate, a monolithic upper receiver with a long Picatinny rail on top made of steel-reinforced polymer which includes internal rails for a weapon bolt carrier, a more streamlined forend for operators who use the C-clamp grip when shooting, and Beretta claims that the it has an accuracy of 1.5 MOA with 5 shots at 100 metres. The polymer lower receiver is equipped with a modular magazine well for the new Beretta 20-round polymer magazine and also has a special magazine-well adapter that can be removed in order to use the M110/SR-25 magazines.

John A. Poindexter\\", Gloria M. Atwater The battle lasted from August 10 to August 13, 1862. Battle Colonel John A. Poindexter and his force of 1200 to 1500 Confederate recruits were caught at Compton Ferry along the Grand River by forces under Union Col. Odon Guitar.Moore, Frank, The Rebellion Record, Vol. V, pages 577-78. In seven days, Guitar's forces pursued Poindexter's for 250 miles and attacked the guerrilla forces three times. They were confronted at Switzler's mill, Little Compton (Compton's Ferry), and on the Muscle Fork of the Chariton River. Here the Federals caught the rebels in the act of crossing the river, causing great havoc and sending them into headlong retreat. Two Union artillery pieces fired a total of eight rounds producing the rout. A large amount of materiel was recovered. During the battle, 150 Confederate soldiers were wounded, killed, or drowned. Another 100 soldiers were taken prisoner. The Union forces fared much better, with only 5 men being wounded and 10 horses being killed. Guitar's forces numbered 550. Accounts of the battle were gruesome. As soldiers attempted to escape, many discarded their guns and plunged with their horses into the river. Some of the horses were able to return to shore, but many drowned. A number of soldiers with their baggage, horses, mules, guns, and wagons were captured. The converging Union forces of Guitar and Benjamin Loan continued to pursue Poindexter's men immediately after this action, dealing them a crippling blow at the Battle of Yellow Creek. The wounded Colonel Poindexter was captured September 1--wearing civilian clothing. Aftermath The result of this battle and the subsequent battle at Yellow Creek was the effective suppression of Confederate recruiting efforts and major guerrilla operations north of the Missouri River in the northwest portion of the state.For a more in-depth discussion of the campaign against Poindexter see Gerteis, Louis S., The Civil War in Missouri: A Military History. Columbia, MO: University of Missouri Press, 2012. . pp 141-143. Following the battles at Compton's Ferry, Yellow Creek, and other sites, Governor Gamble promoted Colonel Guitar to Brigadier-General of Enrolled Missouri Militia.

None of his works survive and he is known as a troubadour only from a single reference to him in a song by another troubadour Guillem was the son of Arnau de Ribes and younger brother of Pon√ß I de Ribes. The family were vassals of the Bishop of Barcelona. His father, a warrior, left the administration of the family castle, Sant Pere de Ribes, in the hands of his younger brother, Ramon I, for long periods and it was Ramon who inherited it after Arnau's death in 1168. Pon√ß, a warrior like his father, took over the lordship of the castle only after Ramon's death in 1180. He was absent for long periods and the actual administration was mainly in the hands of Guillem.See Mart√≠n de Riquer (1964), Hist√≤ria de la Literatura Catalana, vol. 1 (Barcelona: Edicions Ariel), pp. 36-7, for the identification of the troubadour and the lord. In 1190, Pon√ß pawned Ribes to his brother in order to finance and personally oversee the defence of the castle of Miralpeix (now part of Sitges), held by one of his vassals, when it came under siege by two rivals, Berenguer de Castellet and Eymerich de Espiells. The castle was taken in an assault and partially destroyed. In a lawsuit brought against Guillem in the early 1200s, it was alleged that he had deliberately impeded the defence of the castle to his own benefit. He was succeeded by his nephew, Pon√ß II. The troubadour Peire d'Alvernhe composed a song satirizing twelve contemporary troubadours. It was probably first performed for the entourage of Eleanor, daughter of Henry II of England and fianc√©e of Alfonso VIII of Castile, while it was passing through Gascony on its way to Castile in 1173. It is likely that the twelve targets of Peire's satire were present in the entourage at the time. Guillem is the fifth target: {  :E‚Ä¢N Guillems de Ribas lo quins, :qu'es malvatz defors e dedins, :e ditz totz sos vers raucamen, :per que es avols sos retins, :e'atretan se'n fari'us chins; :e l'uoil semblan de vout d'argen.  :Lord Guillem de Ribes is the fifth, :who is wicked outside and in :and recites all his poems harshly, :for his noises are terrible, :like those made by a dog; :and his eyes look like those of a silver statue.The translation comes from Elizabeth Aubrey (1989), \\"References to Music in Old Occitan Literature\\", Acta Musicologica, 61(2):118. } Guillem's active career as a troubadour can be placed in the early 1170s, when he was about thirty years old and before he had inherited the family castle.

Thus the matrix-valued Fourier transform becomes scalar-valued in this case. * The set of irreducible G-representations has a natural group structure in its own right, which can be identified with the group \\\\widehat G := \\\\mathrm{Hom}(G, S^1) of group homomorphisms from G to S^1 = \\\\\\\\{z \\\\in \\\\mathbb C, z=1\\\\\\\\}. This group is known as the Pontryagin dual of G. The Fourier transform of a function f : G \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{C} is the function \\\\widehat{f}: \\\\widehat{G}\\\\to \\\\mathbb{C} given by : \\\\widehat{f}(\\\\chi) = \\\\sum_{a \\\\in G} f(a) \\\\bar{\\\\chi}(a). The inverse Fourier transform is then given by : f(a) = \\\\frac{1}{G} \\\\sum_{\\\\chi \\\\in \\\\widehat{G}} \\\\widehat{f}(\\\\chi) \\\\chi(a). For G = \\\\mathbb Z/n, a choice of a primitive n-th root of unity \\\\zeta yields an isomorphism :G \\\\to \\\\widehat G, given by m \\\\mapsto (r \\\\mapsto \\\\zeta^{mr}). In the literature, the common choice is \\\\zeta = e^{2 \\\\pi i /n}, which explains the formula given in the article about the discrete Fourier transform. However, such an isomorphism is not canonical, similarly to the situation that a finite-dimensional vector space is isomorphic to its dual, but giving an isomorphism requires choosing a basis. A property that is often useful in probability is that the Fourier transform of the uniform distribution is simply \\\\delta_{a,0},\\\\, where 0 is the group identity and \\\\delta_{i,j}\\\\, is the Kronecker delta. Fourier Transform can also be done on cosets of a group. Relationship with representation theory There is a direct relationship between the Fourier transform on finite groups and the representation theory of finite groups. The set of complex-valued functions on a finite group, G, together with the operations of pointwise addition and convolution, form a ring that is naturally identified with the group ring of G over the complex numbers, \\\\mathbb{C}[G]. Modules of this ring are the same thing as representations. Maschke's theorem implies that \\\\mathbb{C}[G] is a semisimple ring, so by the Artin‚ÄìWedderburn theorem it decomposes as a direct product of matrix rings. The Fourier transform on finite groups explicitly exhibits this decomposition, with a matrix ring of dimension d_\\\\varrho for each irreducible representation. More specifically, the Peter-Weyl theorem (for finite groups) states that there is an isomorphism :\\\\mathbb C[G] \\\\cong \\\\bigoplus_{i} \\\\mathrm{End}(V_i) given by :\\\\sum_{g \\\\in G} a_g g \\\\mapsto \\\\left(\\\\sum a_g \\\\rho_i(g): V_i \\\\to V_i\\\\right) The left hand side is the group algebra of G. The direct sum is over a complete set of inequivalent irreducible G-representations \\\\varrho_i : G \\\\to \\\\mathrm{GL}(V_i). The Fourier transform for a finite group is just this isomorphism. The product formula mentioned above is equivalent to saying that this map is a ring isomorphism. Applications This generalization of the discrete Fourier transform is used in numerical analysis. A circulant matrix is a matrix where every column is a cyclic shift of the previous one. Circulant matrices can be diagonalized quickly using the fast Fourier transform, and this yields a fast method for solving systems of linear equations with circulant matrices. Similarly, the Fourier transform on arbitrary groups can be used to give fast algorithms for matrices with other symmetries . These algorithms can be used for the construction of numerical methods for solving partial differential equations that preserve the symmetries of the equations .

On 11 December 2016, Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews announced that a re-elected Labor government would build the North East Link at a cost of $10 billion and construction would commence in late 2020, with an expected completion in 2027.  History =1969‚Äì1972: Bolte Government Plans= In 1969 the Bolte Government unveils its Transportation Plan which outlines multiple freeway corridors in Melbourne to be built including the F7 and F18 corridors which was designed to provide a freeway connection between the Metropolitan Ring Road in Greensborough and the Eastern Freeway at Bulleen Flats or the EastLink junction in Ringwood. =1973‚Äì1976: Hamer Government Cancellations = After Henry Bolte's resignation in 1972, his Liberal successor Rupert Hamer announced in 1973 that some of Bolte's freeway plans are to be pruned, especially those proposed for the inner city (including most/nearly all of the F7 and F18 corridors). As this was the case, Hamer later announced in 1976 that his government would cancel all road reservations for the unbuilt urban freeways at that time, making the remaining road corridors across Melbourne disconnected. =1978: Alternative Proposals= The Joint Road Planning Group developed four 'Preliminary Alternative Proposals' which their Study Office described in \\"Outer Ring Diamond Creek to Ringwood Study, Bulletin 2\\", July 1978. Concept A \\"The general improvement of selected main roads in the area to provide for local needs without specific provision for circumferential outer ring traffic.\\" Concept B \\"An upgrading of selected roads in the area including, for example, the duplication of Fitzsimons Lane Bridge, to facilitate both the local and circumferential traffic.\\" The key roads to be developed were Fitzsimons Lane, Main Road, Wattle Tree Road, Ryans Road and, to the south, Williamsons Road, Reynolds Road (Templestowe), Andersons Creek Road and Springvale Road. Concept C \\"A new arterial road connection, utilising some existing road reservations, but requiring a new crossing over the Yarra Valley.\\" The connection was to go east from Greensborough along Allandale Road (three alternatives) to Reynolds Road (Eltham), south following the transmission lines to a new bridge at Target Road, along Andersons Creek Road or Mullum Mullum Valley and then along Reynolds Road (Templestowe) and Springvale Road. Concept D \\"A new freeway reservation to link the F5 at Diamond Creek to the Scoresby Freeway at Ringwood.\\" These routes from went east from Greensborough and then south, either along Reynolds Road to a bridge at Target Road or \\"East of Research\\" to a bridge at Alexander Road. South of the river, routes along either Mullum Mullum Valley, or the ridge to the east, connected to the proposed Eastern Freeway extension near Quarry Road or Glenvale Road. Bridges would cross at Diamond Creek Road, Ryans Road, Allandale Road, Main Road, Mt Pleasant Road, Heidelberg-Warrandyte Road, Reynolds Road, Tindalls Road, Park Road, Heads Road, Huggins Road, Deep Creek Road and Whitehorse Road. =2002‚Äì2007: Bracks Government and Eddington Report= In 2002, prior to the state election, Transport Minister Peter Batchelor and local ALP state member Craig Langdon promised to Banyule Town Hall that the North East Link would not be built.Kenneth Davidson  WestLink  VicRoads  Government Spending In 2007, the Eddington Report by Sir Rod Eddington was released, recommending the development of a North East Link. =2008‚Äì2010: Brumby Government Proposal= In September 2008, the GHD released a North East link Assessment Proposal. On 8 December 2008, then Minister for Roads and Ports, Labor MP Tim Pallas, under the Brumby Government, announced plans for a North East link.http://www.premier.vic.gov.au/component/content/article/5602.html A North East Link proposal was included in the Brumby government's 2008 Victorian Transport Plan, with an estimated cost of over A$6 billion. On 10 August 2010, Banyule Council contacts Tim Pallas, expressing its disappointment in what appears to be a lack of transparency in the planning process for the North East Link and requests: * Briefing of all options for the North-East Link and any costings and cost benefit analysis. * VicRoads to advise of any new proposals that may be developed for the construction of this link. * Confirmation if a surface link has been considered and any costings for that link. * Confirmation as to whether a surface link is in VicRoads view still a valid option. * VicRoads to undertake full public consultation.http://www.banyule.vic.gov.au/Assets/Files/OM%2011%20October%202010%20Agenda%20and%20Attachments.pdf The proposed freeway was a major factor in the resignation of the local MP for Ivanhoe. On 24 August 2010, Ivanhoe Labor MP Craig Langdon resigned from state politics stating: \\"My resignation also enables me to maintain a long-held commitment to the electorate, which was to resign from the government if I believed it was likely to build a freeway through Viewbank, Heidelberg and the Banyule Flats. Unfortunately, it appears that this could now be the case\\".The Age : Freeway dissenter urges referendum 2010/08/25. On 6 September 2010, Tim Pallas replies to Banyule council advising; * VicRoads' planning for the North East Link is at a preliminary stage and detailed planning is still some way off. * Once the preliminary stage is complete VicRoads will consult Banyule city council and their residents. * The North East link expected to involve a tunnel between Lower Plenty Road and the Eastern Freeway to protect existing suburban areas and to minimise impacts on the Banyule Flats and avoid the Heidi Museum. On 6 October 2010, a North East Link freeway public meeting was held at The Centre in Ivanhoe. On 23 November 2010, Ex-Labor MP Craig Langdon letter boxes thousands of residents of Rosanna, Heidelberg and Ivanhoe with flyer titled \\"No freeway through Banyule\\" criticising Anthony Carbines who was preselected as his successor.

Three proposed routes for the North East Link were identified by consultation report prepared by GHD Consulting for the Department of Premier and Cabinet in 2008. Route 1: An eastern option from the Metropolitan Ring Rd to EastLink via Kangaroo Ground and Chirnside Park. Route 2: A central option from the Metropolitan Ring Rd to EastLink via Eltham and Warrandyte. Route 3: A western option from the Metropolitan Ring Rd to Eastern Freeway at Bulleen via Watsonia. Route 3 was selected as the preferred route. The link proposes a combination of above-ground roadway and tunnel between Lower Plenty Road and the Eastern Freeway at Bulleen Road which will traverse the Banyule Flats and Yarra River.http://www.transport.vic.gov.au/DOI/DOIElect.nsf/$UNIDS+for+Web+Display/2F81FF76ABB4A712CA25752200239E87/$FILE/GHD_EWLNA_and_Northern_Link.pdf Two tunnel proposals have been provided citing selection based on budgetary input. A shorter tunnel from Lower Plenty Rd to Bulleen Rd exiting near the Heide museum and a longer tunnel from Lower Plenty Rd through to the Eastern Freeway. However the final details of the route are yet to be completed and further detailed engineering investigations and community consultation will be undertaken before finalising a route alignment and design for the road connection. This project was submitted to the federal Government of Australia for funding consideration. Criticism of Route 3 * The route will have the Eastern freeway carrying both circumferential ring road traffic plus city bound radial traffic. During peak hours this additional traffic will effectively further reduce the capacity of the Eastern Freeway between Bulleen and Ringwood Previously proposed routes connecting Greensborough to Ringwood avoid this problem. * The current route may physically divide the local community and result in local residents having difficulty in accessing public services and amenities such as schools, shops and transport. However the group Resolve Rossna Road would dispute this as it would alleviate a long felt need in the Heidelberg area.https://resolverosannaroad.com/ * The interchange at Bulleen Road may be a complex tunnel/fly-over arrangement requiring land acquisitions from the adjacent Freeway Golf Course and tennis centre significantly diminishing the local amenity. * The route would use the median of the Eastern Freeway for the proposed Doncaster railway line. * The route options assessment listed in the \\"North East Link Infrastructure Australia Proposal to Commonwealth of Australia\\" (obtained via Freedom of Information) contains no quantitative data supporting the economical costings when comparing routes.http://www.friendsofbanyule.org/media/13591/ia-2009-northeastlink- stage1-6.pdf * The Banyule Flats, the Warringal Parklands and the Yarra Corridor (the areas to be affected by the proposed freeway, tunnel or viaduct) are one of the natural areas in the inner North East and are extensively used for recreation.http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/north-east-link-to- shift-25000-rail-passengers-a-day-to-cars-says-andrews-government- report-20161216-gtchfm.html The Banyule City Council in 2014 tabled a proposal to have the Banyule Flats, the Warringal Parklands and the Yarra Corridor made into a Heritage listed area, but the nomination with Heritage Victoria was unsuccessful.Banyule Council Banyule Council - Victorian Heritage Register.

Preferred Route  On 24 November 2017, the Andrews Government announced that it had selected Route A as the preferred route, identical to that of the preferred route under the former Brumby Government's Proposal. Preliminary costs and property acquisition details were also announced for the preferred route of the North East Link. In April 2019 CPB and Laing O‚ÄôRourke were shortlisted for the $200 million first works package. The works package will begin in early 2020, once planning approvals are in place, and deliver a range of power, water and other utility works to pave the way for major construction on the $15.8 billion project.https://www.miragenews.com/victoria- s-biggest-road-project-another-step-closer/  Exits and interchanges Proposed benefits North East Link would complete Melbourne's Metropolitan Ring Road project and is estimated to carry around 100,000 vehicles a day, providing non-stop movement and easier access for freight operators, particularly between the growing industrial areas around Dandenong, Campbellfield and the new freight-hub near Donnybrook. With Melbourne's north expected to be home to around one million people in 2026, it is posited that the North East Link will reduce reliance on Fitzsimons Lane, Heidelberg Road and Rosanna Road, and enhance road access to Melbourne Airport as well as popular regional and interstate destinations, and will allow traffic to bypass central Melbourne.

Barnes Circus was an American circus run by Alpheus George Barnes Stonehouse. History Stonehouse started his show in 1895 with a pony, a phonograph, and a stereopticon. By 1929, the \\"Al G. Barnes Wild Animal Show\\" had grown to five rings and it was purchased by the American Circus Corporation. American Circus already owned the Sells-Floto Circus, John Robinson Shows, Hagenbeck-Wallace Circus, and Sparks Circus. That same year John Ringling, the owner of the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus, bought out the American Circus Corporation. The five circuses that were part of that acquisition continued to tour under their own names, but were closed one-by-one during the Great Depression. In 1937 the Al G. Barnes Wild Animal Show and Sells Floto were combined into one circus. That circus, Al G. Barnes Sells-Floto toured in 1937 and 1938. In 1938 the co-owned Ringling Bros and Barnum & Bailey Combined Shows was experiencing labor problems which ultimately led to the circus being closed after performances in Scranton, Pennsylvania on June 22. After regrouping at the circus winter quarters in Sarasota, Florida the Ringling-Barnum circus trains were dispatched to Redfield, South Dakota where the two circuses met and were combined into a yet larger circus featuring many of the major stars from Ringling-Barnum. The circus toured from July 11 until November 27, 1938 as \\"Al G. Barnes and Sells- Floto Circus Presenting Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Stupendous New Features. Among the attractions that were featured were big game hunter \\"Bring 'em Back Alive Frank Buck\\" and the gorilla Gargantua. When the show finished its season however, rather than returning to its own winter quarters in Baldwin Park, California, the circus trains traveled to the Ringling winter quarters near Sarasota, Florida, never to emerge again.'' One of their more famous animals was Black Diamond, an Indian elephant whose unpredictable temper resulted in the deaths of several people and was shot between 50-100 times in 1929, before his own death. Performers Although the Al G. Barnes Circus featured many traditional acts associated with circuses, it was known for its wild animal acts. Mabel Stark, the tiger trainer was associated with the circus for many years. Stark joined the circus in 1911, first presenting a horse act. In 1916 she began presenting tigers in the center ring of the wild animal show. Although she left the circus in 1922, she returned in 1930. Bert Nelson was another wild animal trainer who appeared on the circus in the late 1930s. For many seasons, the elephants were trained and presented by Frank \\"Cheerful\\" Gardner. Eddie Woenecker became the circus' bandmaster in 1913 and stayed with the circus through 1922. He returned to the circus in 1936 and continued to perform in that capacity through the 1938 season. Winter quarters and Barnes City Zoo In 1914 the Al G. Barnes Circus began wintering in Venice, California near the Venice lagoon. It continued to winter at that location until November 1920 when the circus trains returned for the winter to a new location on Washington Boulevard between Venice and Culver City, California. The Al G. Barnes Circus was known as a \\"Wild Animal Show,\\" and in December 1923 the \\"Barnes Circus Zoo\\" opened at the corner of Washington Boulevard and McLaughlin Avenue in Culver City. The Zoo cost 79,000 to build and at the time was kept open even when the show was touring. Barnes incorporated the area where the winter quarters and zoo were located as the short-lived town of Barnes City, California. The area was eventually annexed into both Culver City in 1925 and Los Angeles in 1926. Following the annexation of the winter quarters property, Barnes relocated his winter quarters into an unincorporated area in the San Gabriel Valley in 1927. The 300 acres were on Valley Boulevard midway between Baldwin Park and El Monte. From 1927 until 1938 the circus returned to the Baldwin Park quarters, however at two separate locations. At the conclusion of the 1932 season the show unloaded about a half mile east of the original location and that is where it remained until 1938 when most of the equipment was transferred to the Ringling winter quarters in Sarasota at the end of the season. King of the Jungle King of the Jungle is a 1933 Paramount Pictures film that includes animals, performers and scenes from the Al G. Barnes Circus and winter quarters in 1932. Although the movie is set on the lot of \\"Corey's Circus,\\" it was actually filmed on location at the first Baldwin Park winter quarters. Several acts from the circus that season are featured, including Mabel Stark's tiger act. The tigers are mid-performance at the time that the big top catches fire during the film's climatic moments. Notable events On May 15, 1922, a large circus elephant known as Tusko escaped from the Al G. Barnes Circus while it was in Sedro-Woolley, Washington. The elephant demolished fences, knocked over laundry lines and trees, telephone poles, and overturned a Model T. On July 20, 1930, the circus suffered a train wreck in the small community of Canaan Station, New Brunswick, Canada. Three passengers were killed and 17 others were taken to hospital, where one later died of his injuries. Names *Al G. Barnes Circus *Al G. Barnes Wild Animal Circus *Al G.

Background  Born in Keokuk, Iowa, Fry began his golf career as a caddy at the age of 9. The first documentation of Fry's significant amateur play was in 1942 when the Iowa Open and Iowa Amateur were combined into a 54-hole tournament at the Sunnyside course in Waterloo. He came from nowhere and finished fifth in the field. Starting with a mediocre 77, he went through the last 36 holes with a 71-69. He came back in 1947, after 5 years in the military, to be runner up in the Iowa Amateur bowing in match play to Fred Gordon of Belmond 3 and 2.\\"Bob Fry Halted in Finals of Amateur,\\" Gate City, Keokuk, Iowa, June 30, 1947 During 1943 and 1944, Sgt.

In 1960, Fry took the head pro position for three municipal golf courses in Davenport, Iowa (Emeis, Duck Creek and Credit Island). He organized an exhibition match with Arnold Palmer and Gary Player at Emeis Golf Course in the early 1960s. This later became the Quad Cities Open. In 1970, Fry, Heisman Trophy winner Johnny Lujack, Franklin \\"Whitey\\" Barnard, John Deere Corporation brothers Jim and Ray McGloughlin, restaurant owner Nic Chirekos and several others developed Crow Valley Golf Club in Bettendorf, Iowa. Originally intended to be a men's only club, and designed specifically with the PGA Tour in mind, the club was forced to open the links to women with the advent of the 'women's lib' movement. Fry brought the Quad Cities Open (known today as the John Deere Classic) to Crow Valley Golf Club. This tournament continues as an annual PGA Tour event through 2010. > \\"Fry...said the idea of a Quad-City Open probably had its hatching back in > 1964. \\"That year and again in '65, I held a $5,000 tourney at Emeis.., but > we dropped the tourney because the PGA and Tournament Players Division (TPD) > were having their differences,\\" he explained. \\"It took about five years for > the two groups to straighten out their squabble, \\" Fry continued. \\"In 1970, > the two groups adopted a program for smaller sponsoring tournaments, calling > them satellites instead of labeling them class B or minor meets,\\" said Fry. > \\"I happened to be on the list for such an event - and working through > Marshall Dann (the executive director of the Western Golf Association) and > the right parties here in the Quad-Cities - we landed last year's [1971] > tourney.\\" This was probably the best of the 16 satellite stops on the tour > in 1971.This Year's Par: $100,000, Times Democrat, Davenport-Bettendorf, IA, > February 27, 1972 Fry won the Iowa Section PGA tournament five times, including a 1965 record- setting 66-62=128 round at Marshalltown to win by 15 strokes. He played in the Western Open countless times, and qualified for the Los Angeles, Tucson and Phoenix Opens for over 20 years. In 1961, Fry shot a qualifying round of 68 at Scottsdale Country Club, tying for low honors in the $32,500 Phoenix Open.

Fry always talked about balance in his lessons.\\" Jim Hasley, an assistant to Fry before becoming a pro on his own, tells this story of Fry's character: \\"A member from one of the local country clubs came into the pro shop and wanted to purchase some new clubs. Fry asked why the member didn't buy these from his own pro. The member said he had been in an argument with the other pro.

Fry helped design and test new equipment. Many still use the special \\"Bob Fry loft\\" irons.

Choi The book is a revision of the older Muyejebo, made during the reign of King Youngjo (1724‚Äì1776). It adds twelve disciplines or \\"skills\\" of both armed and unarmed fighting by Prince Sado to the original six which were descbribed in the Muyejebo. No copies of the Muyesinbo have survived, but its contents can easily be determined by tracing back and comparing the Muyejebo with the later Muyedobotongji. Prince Sado also originated the term Sib Pal Gi (Ïã≠ÌåîÍ∏∞, ÂçÅÂÖ´ÊäÄ, ‚ÄúEighteen [Fighting] Methods‚Äù or possibly \\"Eighteen [Warrior's] Tools‚Äù if using ÂçÅÂÖ´Âô®), shortened from Bonjo Muye Sib Pal Ban (Î≥∏Ï°∞Î¨¥ÏòàÏã≠ÌåîÎ∞ò, Êú¨Ê¢ùÊ≠¶ËóùÂçÅÂÖ´Ëà¨, \\"A Treatise on the 18 Martial Categories of the Yi Dynasty\\"). This mirrors the Chinese concept of the \\"Eighteen Arms of Wushu\\" (ÂçÅÂÖ´Ëà¨ÂÖµÂô®) to identify the Korean collection of weapons depicted in the Mu Ye Sin Bo (note that ÂçÅÂÖ´Ëà¨ÂÖµÂô® is pronounced Sip Pal Ban Byeong Gi in Korean, Ïã≠ÌåîÎ∞òÎ≥ëÍ∏∞, where the words Ban Byeong are left out to render Prince Sado's term, and these omitted words roughly translate as \\"martial methods\\" making them essentially superfluous when taken in context).  Historical background  The earlier manual of 1610, Muyejebo (Martial Arts Illustrations) had as its background the Imjin War (1592‚Äì1598), which revealed severe shortcomings in the Korean national army causing King Seonjo (1567‚Äì1608) to order reforms based on the successful training model of the Chinese General Qi Jiguang (1527‚Äì1587). During the reign of King Yeongjo (1724‚Äì1776) the Muyejebo was revised, and supplemented with 12 additional fighting methods by Prince Sado, published in 1759. Prince Sado was the heir- apparent of king Yeongjo, but he suffered from a mental illness which triggered violent outbreaks. After the prince took to randomly killing and raping people in the palace, he was executed by suffocation in 1762, aged 27. Both the Muyejebo and Muyesinbo formed the basis for the later Muyedobotongji (\\"Comprehensive Illustrated Manual of Martial Arts\\") of 1795, which added 4 already depicted disciplines only as executed on horseback (namely: flag spear, twin sabres, moon-knife, and flail) in addition to horsemanship itself as well as a polo-like game, bringing the total number of systems to 24. The Eighteen Skills These are the eighteen \\"skills\\" (ÊäÄ skill, ability, method) which are classified into three categories (thrust, slice, and strike) and reflect strong influence from Chinese martial arts. The first six skills already present in the Muyejebo can also be found in the Muyesinbo: *Gonbong Í≥§Î¥â (long staff), c.f.

Like other sillaginids, it is an elongate, slightly compressed fish, growing to a maximum known length of 30 cm. The stout whiting is endemic to Australia, with the species divided into western and eastern populations, with the western population ranging from Shark Bay to Fremantle and the eastern population from Bustard Head, Queensland to northern New South Wales. The species inhabits deep, sandy continental shelf regions to a depth of at least 70 m. The stout whiting is a benthic carnivore, consuming a variety of polychaetes and crustaceans. The species grows rapidly, and sexual maturity is reached at a length of 13 cm, with spawning occurring between December and March. Juveniles of the eastern population move to protected inshore waters, while those of the western population remain offshore their entire life. Stout whiting are the subject of a major export fishery operating out of southern Queensland and to a lesser extent New South Wales, with fishery authorities limiting the yearly catch to 1000 tonnes in Queensland. Most of the catch is exported frozen to a number of Asian countries, although small quantities are sold in Australia, with the net worth of the fishery values at around 3 million Australian dollars per year. Taxonomy and naming The stout whiting is one of 29 species in the genus Sillago, which is one of three divisions of the smelt whiting family Sillaginidae. The smelt- whitings are Perciformes in the suborder Percoidea. The species was first scientifically described by Stead in 1908 based on a specimen collected from Rose Bay in Port Jackson, New South Wales, which was designated to be the holotype. After this description and naming, the species was once again described and named by William Ogilby in 1910 as Sillago auricomis, based on a specimen taken from near Hervey Bay in Queensland. This is considered to be junior synonym under ICZN naming rules and has subsequently been discarded. During a comprehensive revision of the sillaginids in 1985, Roland McKay noted that the eastern and western populations of fish varied slightly in their fin osteology and swimbladder morphology, but recommended a full osteological comparison before placing them in subspecies ranks. McKay also postulates that the two populations became separated during the last ice age, when a land bridge closed the Torres Strait to the movement of the species. The species is most commonly known as the 'stout whiting', and is recognised as such by the Australian Government. The species is occasionally called the 'yellow-cheek whiting' and also 'school whiting', a broad name applied to a number of Australian sillaginids. Description The stout whiting is similar in appearance to a number of Australian sillaginids, with dorsal fin and swimbladder morphology the best identification features. It is a small fish, reaching a known maximum length of 30 cm, but more commonly seen below 23 cm. Like most sillaginids, the stout whiting has a slightly more convex dorsal profile compared to the ventral profile, reflecting the benthic nature of the species. The dorsal fin is composed of 2 sections; the first consisting of 11 spines and the second of 1 spine followed by 16 to 18 soft rays. Large specimens show a distinct anterior keel on the first spine of the first dorsal fin, with this feature being more pronounced in the eastern population. The anal fin is similar to the second dorsal fin, having 2 spines followed by 16 or 19 soft rays. The lateral line has 65-70 scales, whilst the cheek has 2 to 3 rows of cteniod scales, and there are 33 vertebrae in total. The swimbladders of the two populations are slightly different, with the eastern population having small anterolateral extensions, while the western population lack these. There is a single tapering posterior extension and a duct like process which runs from the ventral surface to the urogenital opening. In life, the stout whiting is a creamy yellow to sandy pink colour dorsally, with a silvery white with mauve reflections ventrally. The dorsal and ventral colours are sharply separated by a silvery mid lateral band that is often only weakly visible. The body and fins are devoid of any dark markings, with the only breaks in colouration being yellow blotches on the cheeks and a yellow blotch on the base of the first dorsal fin. The first dorsal fin has a white base, becoming darker dorsally, while the anal fin is white, becoming more yellow at the base of the fin. The caudal fin is a pale lemon yellow with a speckled margin, the pelvic fins are white to hyaline and the pectoral fins are hyaline. There have been records of geographical variation in colour amongst the species, especially within Shark Bay. The Shark Bay fish may have faint gold bars trending 50 degrees above the mid lateral silvery band, and may have black dusting on the dorsal and anal fins. Distribution and habitat Stout whiting are endemic to Australia, and consist of two apparently disjunct populations; one on the eastern seaboard, the other on the western seaboard. The eastern population has a wider distribution, inhabiting waters from Bustard Head, Queensland to southern New South Wales. The western population exists from Shark Bay in the north to Fremantle in the south. In his 1985 revision of the Sillaginidae, McKay reported the species from as far north as the Gulf of Carpentaria, but did not mention any specimen from this far north in his follow-up catalogue for the FAO. Stout whiting are found in deeper waters than other Australian sillaginids, inhabiting sandy substrates at depths of 10 to 70 m. juvenile fish of the eastern population inhabit shallower waters for the first year of life, often in large bays and near surf beaches. The fish of the western population spend their entire lives offshore. In northern Australia, the same offshore niche is occupied by the mud whiting, Sillago lutea. In southern Queensland, where it coexists in deeper waters with S. flindersi, the stout whiting shows preference for deep sandy strata with a riverine influence. Biology Due to the emergence of stout whiting as a major east coast fishery, a number of detailed studies have been undertaken to determine the reproductive and growth characteristics of the species in southern Queensland, while a series of studies in southern Western Australia have focused on the diet and movements of the species in relation to the ecology of coexisting sillaginids. Like most smelt-whitings, the stout whiting is a schooling species, occasionally associating with S. vitttata, S. burrus and S. bassensis in southern Western Australia and with S. flindersi in southern Queensland. The species is thought to form large schools mostly at dawn and dusk. =Diet and feeding= Stout whiting are benthic predators that forage the sea floor using their protrusile jaws to 'suck up' prey from the substrate. Research conducted in southern Queensland indicates the species preys mostly on crustaceans and polychaete worms. Individuals less than 10 cm predominantly consume small crustaceans such as copepods and mysids, while older fish took more polychaetes. Amphipods and the shrimp genus Callianassa were also commonly taken in this study. In southern Queensland, there is also a strong temporal control on the diet, with summer months showing much higher polychaete intake compared to crustaceans and vice versa in winter. A detailed study in southern Western Australia indicated amphipods and polychaetes are the two primary components of this population's diet. Penaeids, ostracods, ophiuroid echinoderms and a variety of molluscs also make up a significant part of the species diet in this area. Once again, larger fish took more polychaetes, and in general broadened their diet with increasing age. This resulted in a low dietary overlap with other coexisting sillaginids present in the same area. The stout whiting is also a major prey species itself for a number of species, with seals, dolphins and larger fish known predators of the species. =Reproduction and growth= The stout whiting reaches sexual maturity by the end of its second year of life, with around 50% of fish accomplishing this after only one year. The fish are around 13 cm once they reach sexual maturity. The patterns of spawning and movement of the juveniles differs between the eastern and western populations. In the western population, unlike many co-occurring sillaginids, stout whiting do not move inshore to spawn and the juveniles do not make their way to shallower waters; instead they spawn offshore, with the fish spending their entire lives in this environment. In contrast, the eastern population do use inshore nursery areas for the juveniles including bays and surf beaches, with this difference between populations attributed to increased competition between sillaginids by some authors. In both populations, spawning occurs over summer, with the fish spawning multiple times between December and March. Stout whiting are fast growers in comparison to most other smelt-whitings, reaching 80% of its final length after 2 years of life. The species is known to reach a maximum age of 7 years, although most individuals do not survive more than 3 years. Relationship to humans Stout whiting, like most of the smelt-whitings are considered to be good quality table fish, although have soft flesh which results in a tendency to bruise easily. Due to their mostly offshore nature and small size, they are rarely targeted or caught by recreational fishermen, who take an estimated 1 tonne per year. They are however are a major target for commercial operators, especially in southern Queensland. The Queensland fishery originated in 1981, after a single operator began targeting eastern school whiting, S. flindersi. It was soon discovered that stout whiting were highly abundant in the surrounding region and the fishery began to shift towards the species. The original operator who realised the potential of the fishery continued after the market took a downfall, upgrading equipment with a new snap freezing facility, which became essential for exporting the fish. There was a rapid expansion in the fishery between 1989 and 1990, with 10 operators recording a 1789 tonne haul in 1990. In 1991 the market once again took a downfall due to low demand, and the fishery is now closely monitored by fishery authorities, with a 1000 tonne limit on the total yearly catch in place since 2000. This limit includes the fish taken as bycatch in other fisheries such as prawn trawling, which means often a sizable amount must be discarded. In New South Wales, stout whiting were mostly discarded by trawlers until an export market developed in the 1970s. Substantial amounts are taken and mostly discarded by prawn trawlers, and the catch has been stable at around 300-500 tonnes per year since 2000. The western population is not highly exploited. The fishery is worth a reported 3 million Australian dollars annually (around $2.80 per kg in 1999), with the fish exported to Thailand, China, Vietnam, Japan and Taiwan. These exported fish compete with local Asian sillaginids, especially northern whiting and Japanese whiting, resulting in substantial price fluctuations. Few fish make their way to local markets where they are sold as butterfly fillets.

While the city's main form of transport is private transport on the road network, transport is also available by bus, ferry and aircraft. A suburban train service operated between Hobart and Brighton from the 1870s until 31 December 1974.The Hobart Suburban Passenger Service 1875-1975 Stokes, H.J.W. Australian Railway History, February;March 2005 pp43-67;108-119 There has been, however, talk in recent years of reinstating a train service in the northern suburbs. Public Transport A bus in Hobart Public transport in Hobart has been provided exclusively by buses since 1968. Trams ran in Hobart from 1893 to 1960 and were briefly replaced by trolleybuses, from 1960 to 1968. The low population density of Hobart has resulted in the creation of bus routes which cover a wide area and operate at a low frequency. The consequence is that bus travel is not competitive with travel by car, because routes are often lengthy and indirect, meaning that passengers can take a long time to reach their final destination. This has contributed to Hobart having the second-lowest public transport patronage in Australia. Since the completion of the Brighton Transport Hub, the former rail line through inner Hobart has fallen into disuse. Serious constraints in the road network, along with low-frequency bus services, have led to ongoing discussion of introducing light rail to Hobart.Waterhouse, Charles: Bid for trams back on track, The Mercury, 9 August 2010. It would make use of the rail corridor, creating a new express route to Hobart. The proposed light rail system is known as Riverline or the Northern Suburbs Railway. Taxis and limousines operate with no ties to Metro. Taxi Combined and Yellow Cabs run the large fleets of taxicabs in Hobart. Bicycle There are many bike tracks in the greater Hobart area, one of the most notable being the intercity bike track which runs from Hobart 12 km north to Glenorchy along an unused rail line of the Hobart‚ÄìBridgewater rail corridor. Other bike routes travel through Mount Wellington and the waterfront of the River Derwent at various locations.Traffic on the Tasman Highway  Road  The release of the Hobart Area Transportation Study in 1964 has influenced the use of cars as the dominant mode of transport in Hobart. The Davey/Macquarie couplet expand east-west along the southern fringe of the city centre connecting the three major highways; the Southern Outlet, the Tasman Highway and the Brooker Highway which expand out to the outer suburbs. These highways are in turn supported by secondary arterial roads; Goodwood, Sandy Bay and Main Roads as well as the East Derwent and South Arm Highways. Water A Mona ferry at Brooke Street Pier, Hobart Several private ferry operators run are based in Sullivans Cove for commuter, tourist and leisure purposes. Destinations include Port Arthur on the Tasman Peninsula, Peppermint Bay at Woodbridge, the eastern shore town centre of Bellerive, Wrest Point Casino in Sandy Bay, and Museum of Old and New Art in Berriedale.MONA Online Hobart has the second deepest natural port in the world, second to only Rio de Janeiro in Brazil. As a result, it sees an extensive cruise ship calendar, with approximately 30 ships berthing at Sullivans Cove between October and April each summer. Hobart has also hosted visiting US Navy ships. Hobart serves as Australia's main sea link to Antarctica for the Australian Antarctic Division, headquartered in Kingston. Hobart is the home port to the Australian Icebreaker the Aurora Australis which serves the Australian Antarctic Territory during the summer months. Hobart is also home to the French ship L'Astrolabe, which makes regular supply runs to the French Southern Territories located around Antarctica. Airports Hobart International Airport, located in the eastern satellite suburb of Cambridge, Tasmania, is Tasmania's busiest airport. 3 airlines and approaching 2 million domestic passengers utilize the airport each year. The airport is a hub for Skytraders, which operates chartered flights to Antarctica. Cambridge Aerodrome is situated in the same suburb and caters exclusively for general aviation and charter flights.

Examples of skeleton extraction of figures in the binary image Morphological skeletons are of two kinds: * Those defined by means of morphological openings, from which the original shape can be reconstructed, * Those computed by means of the hit-or-miss transform, which preserve the shape's topology. Skeleton by openings=Lantu√©joul's formula=Continuous images In (Lantu√©joul 1977),See also (Serra's 1982 book) Lantu√©joul derived the following morphological formula for the skeleton of a continuous binary image X\\\\subset \\\\mathbb{R}^2: :S(X)=\\\\bigcup_{\\\\rho >0}\\\\bigcap_{\\\\mu >0}\\\\left[(X\\\\ominus \\\\rho B)-(X\\\\ominus \\\\rho B)\\\\circ \\\\mu \\\\overline B\\\\right], where \\\\ominus and \\\\circ are the morphological erosion and opening, respectively, \\\\rho B is an open ball of radius \\\\rho, and \\\\overline B is the closure of B. Discrete images Let \\\\\\\\{nB\\\\\\\\}, n=0,1,\\\\ldots, be a family of shapes, where B is a structuring element, :nB=\\\\underbrace{B\\\\oplus\\\\cdots\\\\oplus B}_{n\\\\mbox{ times}}, and :0B=\\\\\\\\{o\\\\\\\\}, where o denotes the origin. The variable n is called the size of the structuring element. Lantu√©joul's formula has been discretized as follows. For a discrete binary image X\\\\subset \\\\mathbb{Z}^2, the skeleton S(X) is the union of the skeleton subsets \\\\\\\\{S_n(X)\\\\\\\\}, n=0,1,\\\\ldots,N, where: :S_n(X)=(X\\\\ominus nB)-(X\\\\ominus nB)\\\\circ B. Reconstruction from the skeleton The original shape X can be reconstructed from the set of skeleton subsets \\\\\\\\{S_n(X)\\\\\\\\} as follows: :X=\\\\bigcup_n (S_n(X)\\\\oplus nB). Partial reconstructions can also be performed, leading to opened versions of the original shape: :\\\\bigcup_{n\\\\geq m} (S_n(X)\\\\oplus nB)=X\\\\circ mB. The skeleton as the centers of the maximal disks Let nB_z be the translated version of nB to the point z, that is, nB_z=\\\\\\\\{x\\\\in E x-z\\\\in nB\\\\\\\\}. A shape nB_z centered at z is called a maximal disk in a set A when: * nB_z\\\\in A, and * if, for some integer m and some point y, nB_z\\\\subseteq mB_y, then mB_y ot\\\\subseteq A. Each skeleton subset S_n(X) consists of the centers of all maximal disks of size n.  Performing Morphological Skeletonization on Images  Skeleton image of fingerprint operated on by Matlab. Original, unaltered image is on the left. The middle image has generated using bwmorph(Matlab) without preprocessing. The rightmost image, was preprocessed using Automatic Thresholding to increase contrast and skeleton was generated using bwmorph Morphological Skeletonization can be considered as a controlled erosion process. This involves shrinking the image until the area of interest is 1 pixel wide. This can allow quick and accurate image processing on an otherwise large and memory intensive operation. A great example of using skeletonization on an image is processing fingerprints. This can be quickly accomplished using bwmorph; a built-in Matlab function which will implement the Skeletonization Morphology technique to the image. The image to the right shows the extent of what skeleton morphology can accomplish. Given a partial image, it is possible to extract a much fuller picture. Properly pre- processing the image with a simple Auto Threshold grayscale to binary converter will give the skeletonization function an easier time thinning. The higher contrast ratio will allow the lines to joined in a more accurate manner.

Hyv√§rinen is a member of Finland men's national volleyball team.  Career  Hyv√§rinen started his career in Varkaus. When he was Sixteen years old, he moved to Kuortane and attended to a high school specialised to sports. That year he also started to train with Finnish national juniors. He only lived and played in Kuortane for one year, before moving back to Varkaus where he started to play in Keski-Savon Pateri. Hyv√§rinen played two seasons for Pateri. After these two seasons he signed a contract with Muuramen Lentopallo. He play for Muurle in seasons 2008‚Äì2010. After season 2010 Hyv√§rinen said that he does not want anymore play in Muurle, because he did not like the clubs acting. Many fans were afraid of that Hyv√§rinen ends his career and it was close. Hyv√§rinen started play badminton and he joined in the few tournaments. Likely he got contract from France and played great season in France league.

Hyv√§rinen plays as wing spiker in KyKy.  National team  Hyv√§rinen plays also for Finland national team. His rise to the national team was a sum of many things. Team Finlands coach Mauro Berruto did not invite him to the camp of the National team in Kuortane. When national team was training in Kuortane, Hyv√§rinen was also in there because he was in search for sport director school in Kuortane. Hyv√§rinen heard that the national team was training there, so he decide to call coach Berruto and asked from him is it was possible to start training with the team. Berruto accepted the proposition and Hyv√§rinen came to trainings. After the first time he attended in the team training, Berruto was really excited about his natural talent. He wanted him to the team full-time, and that was how his National career started. Hyv√§rinen's first appearance in a Finnish national team was against Bulgaria World League 2008. He was the best player of the game. After that media was highly excited about him and praised Hyv√§rinen to be a sensation. Pasi played for the team last six World League games, and Finland won four from those. He had the best reception in the whole World League.  Beach volley  Pasi Hyv√§rinen has also played actively beach volley for many years. His best result in beach volley is U-19 European Championships 5th place. His other achievements are 9th place in U-21 European Championships and 9th place in U-23 European Championships. In those competitions Hyv√§rinen was a few years younger than most other players.

The plot focuses on a wealthy father on his deathbed who invites his four daughters home for Christmas and tells them he suspects his second wife of poisoning him. Shortly after, the girls learn that their stepmother was accused of killing her first husband, and they begin to fall prey to a killer dressed in a yellow rain slicker. Plot The film opens in an enormous house where wealthy Benjamin Morgan is talking to his eldest daughter, Alex. He believes his wife, Elizabeth, is trying to poison him. Alex believes him. Morgan then sends Alex off to pick up her three sisters. While Alex is driving, she stops and asks her father's doctor, Ted Lindsay, for directions. He gives them to her and comments on the fact that the daughters haven't returned home since their mother committed suicide five years earlier. Later that night, Alex returns with her three sisters, Frederica a.k.a. Freddie, Joanna, and Christine. They park inside the barn. Once inside the house, they meet their stepmother, Elizabeth. Their father then calls them to his room, where he urges the sisters to kill Elizabeth before she kills them. Elizabeth, meanwhile, has gone outside in the rain to get something from the barn. She then comes back to the confused sisters and shows them all their rooms before making dinner. Joanna wants to leave, while Freddie begins drinking and taking anti-depressants. Christine goes downstairs to make coffee for Freddie and finds Elizabeth making tea. Christine then notices Elizabeth's yellow rain slicker, gloves, and boots by the door. Christine brings Freddie the coffee, but she doesn't want it, preferring the vodka and other alcoholic beverages she has brought; she also talks about their mother and how she never should have died. Elizabeth finishes making dinner and calls the girls to come down; but before they can eat, Joanna bombards Elizabeth with questions about her first husband's death, accusing her of murder. Elizabeth silences her and tells Joanna to watch her mouth or something may happen, when suddenly Freddie screams upstairs. The sisters run upstairs and find Freddie in their mother's old room, clutching a glass of vodka, and holding a piece of glass that is cutting into her hand. She is drunk and crying, pointing out a portrait of their mother and blaming their father for her suicide, informing them of his many affairs with different women. As they put Freddie to bed, Alex accuses Elizabeth of unlocking the door to the room on purpose. Later that night, the storm picks up and Joanna informs Alex that she isn't going to stay, asking for Alex's car keys to drive to the railroad station so she can go home. Alex tries to get her to stay, but she refuses, taking Alex's keys and wishing Christine and Freddie goodbye, telling them to give their father an excuse for her departure. When she goes to her car in the barn, she becomes the victim of a figure in a yellow rain slicker, gloves, and boots; she is stabbed in the back with a pitchfork, falling into the mud. Inside, Elizabeth is making milk and honey for Freddie to help her sleep, when Christine comes into the kitchen, once again refusing the drink. Elizabeth then goes to give Freddie the drink, while Alex watches from their father's room. Freddie won't accept the milk and honey, but keeps drinking alcohol instead, eventually climbing into the bathtub for a bath and passing out. All of a sudden, the same intruder that killed Joanna grabs Freddie's feet and pulls her underwater, where she drowns. The next morning, Christmas Day, Dr. Ted Lindsay shows up at the house, informing Christine that the roads are washed out from the storm, and that he will be popping in and out for a couple of days. Christine then finds Freddie's body and screams, bringing the others into the bathroom, where once again Alex accuses Elizabeth of poisoning the drink she brought for Freddie. Elizabeth informs her that Freddie denied it, and that she drank it herself, and tells them that Freddie had some pills out on the dresser. Benjamin calls up to find out what happened, and Elizabeth informs him that Freddie committed suicide or accidentally drowned, while Christine and Alex put Freddie's body in her bed, before calling the police. Christine goes to call the police only to find that the phone is dead, and realizes that Joanna has the car and they're all trapped in the house. She then decides to go out through the woods to a neighbor's house, and informs Alex, telling her not to tell Elizabeth. Upon traveling through the woods to find the house, Christine notices she's being followed, she starts to panic, and begins running. All the while being chased by the murderer in the yellow slicker, gloves, and boots carrying a pitchfork. She becomes lost and manages to hide beneath a log, watching the killer leave, and making a run for it. Night has now fallen, and the rain is beginning to slow, and Alex is inside Benjamin's room, spotting Elizabeth walking outside with a yellow slicker on. Christine finally makes it to the house covered in mud, and notices that the car is still inside the barn, she goes over to it, and trips over Joanna's dead body half buried in mud. Elizabeth then appears, telling her to come with her, making her scream and run inside the house, where she locks the door, and finding Benjamin's dead body in his bed. Elizabeth then goes to the cellar doors, and crawls inside, going up to the house door, while Christine screams for Alex to come out and escape with her. Elizabeth finally opens the door, and Christine climbs inside a mirrored cabinet, listening as Elizabeth tells her to come out from hiding and leave with her. She then goes outside to find her, and Christine bursts through the front door to get help, running down the road to seek safety. While running from the house, Christine flags down a passing car, occupied by Alex. She tries to tell Alex that everyone is dead and that Elizabeth is the killer, but Alex then informs her that she was actually the killer, and was going to frame Elizabeth. She couldn't deal with the past, so she decided to forget it, by getting rid of her father and sisters, and since Christine was the last one left, she had to die too. She then hits Christine with a tire iron, sending her headfirst down a steep ravine filled with rocks and sticks, looking down and seeing her body crumpled into a heap. Ted then drives by and Alex quickly tells him that Elizabeth went insane and killed everyone, including Christine who went off into the woods. Ted then drives to the house, while Alex drives to the police station, bringing the cops back to the house the next morning. Once she gets there, she tells them where the three bodies are, and goes inside, finding out that they found Christine. She goes into her room, and thinks that Christine is dead, until she opens her eyes, then Alex snaps, laughing hysterically, and is dragged away by the police. All the while Christine watches, crying, from her bedroom, eventually letting Ted take her to the airport, leaving Elizabeth alone to the Morgan farmhouse.

Reception Justin Kerswell from Hysteria Lives! awarded the film 4/5 stars, writing, \\"Perhaps the film sails too close to soap opera histrionics at times... However, the performances are roundly so good that this doesn't matter, plus the story just keeps twisting and turning.\\" Brett Gallman from Oh, the Horror! wrote, \\"Unfolding like a film adaptation of an Agatha Christie play, Home For the Holidays often feels stagebound and hemmed up; if not for beating the ‚ÄúChristmas horrors‚Äù out of the gate, I suspect it may be even more obscure than it already is, despite all of the talent involved. As it stands, it's a movie you'll probably hear about this time every year when horror fans begin to discuss the holiday-tinged offerings, and this is one of the last courses you'll ever need to digest.\\" ReferencesExternal links  *Home for the Holidays: The Terror Trap 1972 television films 1972 films 1970s Christmas films 1970s slasher films ABC Movie of the Week ABC Motion Pictures films American films American Christmas films American slasher films Christmas horror films Christmas television films Films with screenplays by Joseph Stefano Films produced by Aaron Spelling Films directed by John Llewellyn Moxey Horror television films ","title":"Home for the Holidays (1972 film)"},{"id":"18537249","title":"List of parties to the Chemical Weapons Convention"},{"id":"18537252","text":"is a private junior college in Kiyotake, Miyazaki, Japan, established in 1965.

Born in Copenhagen, he was a brother of the composer Hans Ernst Kr√∏yer. He started studying medicine at the University of Copenhagen in 1817, which he later changed to history and philology. While a student, he was a supporter of the Philhellenic movement, and he participated as a volunteer in the Greek War of Independence along with several fellow students. Upon his return to Denmark, Kr√∏yer gained an interest in zoology. In 1827, he took the position as assistant teacher in Stavanger, where he met, and later married, Bertha Cecilie Gjesdal. Bertha's sister, Ellen Cecilie Gjesdal, was deemed unfit to bring up her child, so Henrik and Bertha adopted the boy, who took on the name Peder Severin Kr√∏yer, and later became a well- known painter. Kr√∏yer returned to Copenhagen in 1830 where he was employed as a teacher in natural history at the Military Academy. As the course lacked a textbook, Kr√∏yer wrote and published ' (1833). During his career he often travelled along the coasts of Denmark where he studied marine life, especially fish and crustaceans, and this resulted in his main work ' (\\"The Fish of Denmark\\", 3 volumes, 1838-1853). Kr√∏yer also founded the journal Naturhistorisk tidsskrift, for which he served as editor and to which he contributed numerous articles. During his life he visited most of the coasts of Western Europe as well as Newfoundland. But his health eventually deteriorated and in 1869 he had to take his leave of his position of head of the Natural Museum of Copenhagen which he had held since 1847. He gained the title of professor in 1853.

Peshwa Madhavrao I mainly sought his assistance in his attempt to restore Maratha Empire in the North after the defeat in the Battle of Panipat (1761).  Early life  Visaji Krushna was born in a Karhade Brahmin family having surname ‚ÄòChinchalkar‚Äô. There is no mention as to his year of birth, however, it must be around 1730. He got the title ‚ÄòBiniwale‚Äô (which means a person at the front) during his career as a Military General since his troops would remain at the front of the Maratha army during battles.  Career as General  On 10 October 1759, Visaji Krushna defeated Nizam's troops and conquered the fort of Ahmednagar. In 1760-1761, he fought in the Panipat war under the leadership of Sadashivrao Bhau. In 1769, he marched towards Udaipur along with his senior Ramchandra Ganesh Kanade. The Rajputs there agreed to pay him Rs.60 lakhs towards the tribute. On 5 April 1770, he defeated Jats of Haryana. In October 1770 he vanquished Najib Khan Rohilla, the main opponent of the Battle of Panipat (1761). In November 1771, he was appointed ‚ÄòIn Charge of the Northern front of Marathas‚Äô by Peshwa Madhavrao I. In February 1772, along with Mahadji Shinde, he overpowered the Rohilkhand at Shukratal by defeating Zabtakhan. He took severe revenge of the defeat of Panipat by breaking the tomb of Najib Khan, by looting the artillery and wealth of the Rohillas and by recovering from them an additional tribute of Rs.40 lakhs.  Honor by Peshwa Madhavrao  Peshwa Madhavrao I was so delighted with Visaji Krushna's grand victory in the Rohilkhand that he specifically mentioned in his written Will to shower golden flowers on him during his arrival at the border of Pune.  Later life and death  When Visaji Krushna arrived to Pune from North, he brought with him huge jewelry and cash of not less than Rs.22 lakhs. Meanwhile, Peshwa Madhavrao I had died and Peshwa Narayanrao was murdered. Hence, Visaji Krushna was welcomed by Peshwa Raghunath Rao and he was showered with the golden flowers as wished by Peshwa Madhavrao I in his Will. When came to know about Raghunath Rao's involvement in Narayanrao's murder, Visaji Krushna joined hands with ‚ÄòNana Phadnis‚Äô to restore Peshwa Sawai Madhavrao on the Peshwa throne. There is no reference found as to his date of death and cause thereof, however, it must not have taken place on the battlefield.

Triple Crown Productions was formed in 1985 after CBS terminated its contract with the New York Racing Association. Prior to that, the individual racing associations made their own deals with the TV networks (ABC and CBS). ABC Sports won the rights to broadcast all three races, as well as many prep races. Ratings went up after the package was centralized. This arrangement continued until 2001, when NBC Sports took over. Under NBC, ratings continued to go up, by as much as 20 percent in some years. It didn't hurt that many horses, like Funny Cide and Smarty Jones, were making Triple Crown runs during those years (although all of them failed). Notes=Kentucky Derby= On May 3, 1952, the first national television coverage of the Kentucky Derby took place. In 1985, a group of people wanted to increase the stature of the Triple Crown on television. Other than the Kentucky Derby, the Preakness Stakes and Belmont Stakes were considered the two \\"other\\" races. ABC Sports, which had broadcast the Derby since 1975, wanted to air all three races. CBS Sports, which showed the other two races, had much lower ratings for them, with the possible exceptions of years in which the Crown was at stake like 1973, 1977, and 1978. In October 1999, NBC Sports won the rights to broadcast the three races in 2001. NBC Sports currently has the rights to air the Kentucky Derby until 2025. =Preakness Stakes= In 1948, the Preakness was televised for the first time by CBS. In 1977, ABC was awarded the contract to televise the Preakness. In October 1999, NBC Sports won the rights to broadcast the three races in 2001.

It is now in the Uffizi collection in Florence, Italy. Description, style and authorship A copy cast in 1885, displayed at the horticultural center in Fairmount Park, Philadelphia The two young men are engaged in the pankration, a kind of wrestling similar to the present-day sport of mixed martial arts. The two figures are wrestling in a position now known as a \\"cross-body ride\\" in modern folkstyle wrestling. The upper wrestler has his left leg entwined with his opponent's left leg, with his body across the opponent's body, lifting the opponent's right arm.Techniques of the Ancient Wrestlers, Milt Sherman, Amateur Wrestling, January, 2000. Accessed September 13, 2011. In a well-known modern series of wrestling moves, the upper wrestler would now try to lift his opponent's arm above his head to force a pinning move called the \\"Guillotine.\\"See, e.g. pp. 124-128 in Their muscular structure is very defined and exaggerated due to their physical and sustained effort. Neither of the two heads are original to the group, though that of the lower figure is older and is as advanced sylistically as the sons in the \\"Niobe Group\\".The head of the lower youth is antique, though not belonging to this sculpture; the other youth's head has been modelled to complement it. (Haskell and Penny 1981:337). The heads were added after the sculpture was rediscovered. Philippe Magnier's somewhat weathered copy of c. 1684‚Äì1687 (Louvre Museum) The group are considered to be finest quality Roman copies of a lost bronze. Not every 20th-century viewer admired \\"a work once famous and now unfairly neglected\\", as art historian Kenneth Clark said of it: \\"If we can bring our eyes to rest on the unpleasant surface of a somewhat lifeless replica, we discover that the original must have been a Lysippic bronze of masterly complexity and condensation.\\"Kenneth Clark, The Nude: A Study in Ideal Form 1956:245. The sculpture has been attributed variously to Myron, Cephisodotus the Younger or Heliodorus. The last two are mentioned by Pliny as creators of a sculptural format called symplegmata, signifying sculptures of figures closed in struggle, whether purely physical or amatory.Pliny's Natural History 36.35, described the much- admired symplegma of Pan and Plympos in the Portico of Octavia; see Jerome Jordan Politt, Art in the Hellenistic Age 1986:130f. Currently the sculpture is considered to be the best-quality Roman copy from a lost original Hellenistic bronze of the third century BCE, either of the Pergamene school or the circle of Lysippus. Rediscovery The Wrestlers before modern cleaning The discovery of The Wrestlers caused such an immediate sensation among the cognoscenti of Rome, that the event can be dated to the very end of March or beginning of April 1583, in a vigna belonging to the Tommasini da Gallese family near Porta San Giovanni, Rome, together with the group of individual sculptures called the Niobids. Circumstances of their discovery, and the fact that the heads were missing, led early antiquarians‚Äîand the engravers who worked to their direction‚Äîto group the paired figures with these Niobids. Within days of their excavation, Valerio Cioli, a sculptor and restorer of Roman antiquities in Rome, was writing to the secretary of Francesco I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, to alert his patron to the discovery, and the Medici lost no time: on 25 June the group, and the Niobids were purchased from a member of the Varese family, who had managed to gain possession of them in the intervening weeks, by the Grand Duke's brother (and eventual heir) Ferdinando Cardinal de' Medici, who took it to add to the outstanding gallery of antiquities at Villa Medici. There it was illustrated in an engraving of 1594.The early history of the sculpture given here follows Francis Haskell and Nicholas Penny, Taste and the Antique: The Lure of Classical Sculpture 1500-1900 (Yale University Press) 1981: p 337f. The Tribuna of the Uffizi (1722) by John Zoffany: The Wrestlers (centre) is surrounded by English and Italian connoisseurs at the Tribuna. The Wrestlers is now among the Medici collections in the Galerie degli Uffizi. where it was a main feature of the Tribuna of the Uffizi. The sculpture was cleaned of its former somewhat oily patina. The sculpture has been reproduced in marble, bronze and plaster, and in modern times cast in resin, both in full size and in miniature, and the subject in general was treated by Michelangelo.Michelangelo: Due lottatori ca 1530 (Casa Buonarroti, Florence) Philippe Magnier produced a marble copy of the group ca 1684-87 for the gardens of Versailles - it was later moved to Marly, and is now in the Louvre.

Vishay has manufacturing plants in Israel, Asia, Europe, and the Americas where it produces rectifiers, diodes, MOSFETs, optoelectronics, selected integrated circuits, resistors, capacitors, and inductors. Vishay Intertechnology revenues for 2018 were $3.035 billion. As of December 31, 2018, Vishay Intertechnology had approximately 24,100 full-time employees.Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 Vishay is one of the world's foremost manufacturers of power MOSFETs. They have a wide range of power electronic applications, including portable information appliances, internet communications infrastructure, power integrated circuits, cell phones, and notebook computers.  History  Film capacitor by Vishay Vishay Intertechnology was founded in 1962 by Polish-born Dr. Felix Zandman. The Company was named after Zandman's ancestral village in present-day Lithuania, Veisiejai. It began operations with a patented technology that had two product lines: foil resistors and foil resistance strain gauges. In 1985, having grown from a start-up into the world's leading manufacturer of these original products, the company began an ongoing series of acquisitions to become a broadline manufacturer of electronics components. Having expanded into so many product lines, Vishay announced in October 2009 that it would be creating a spin-off company which focuses on their high precision technologies in Foil Technology. Vishay Precision Group represents approximately 9% of Vishay annual revenue, and included their product lines in Bulk Metal Foil Resistors, micro-measurements, load cells, process weighing, and on-board weighing. In July 2010, Vishay Intertechnology completed the spin-off of Vishay Precision Group (VPG). Since 1985, Vishay has pursued a business strategy that principally consists of the following elements: expanding within the electronic components industry, primarily through the acquisition of other manufacturers of electronic components; reducing expenses; transferring manufacturing operations to countries with lower labor costs and government-sponsored incentives; maintaining significant production facilities in regions where Vishay markets the bulk of its products; continually rolling out new products; and strengthening relationships with customers and strategic partners. As a result of this strategy, Vishay has grown from a small manufacturer of precision resistors and resistance strain gages to one of the world's largest manufacturers and suppliers of a broad line of electronic components.http://www.snl.com/interactive/lookandfeel/4165163/VSH_2009.pdf Some of the manufacturers that Vishay has acquired include HiRel Systems (2012), the resistor business of Huntington Electric (2011), the wet tantalum capacitor business of KEMET (2008), the PCS business of International Rectifier (2007), BCcomponents (Beyschlag Centralab components, which was previously part of Philips Electronics Components) (2002),https://www.vishay.com/company/brands/bccomponents/ General Semiconductor, the infrared components business of Infineon, Mallory (NACC), and Tansitor (2001), Cera-Mite, Electro-Films, and Spectrol (2000), Siliconix and Telefunken (1998), Vitramon (1994), Roederstein (1993), Sprague (1992), Sfernice (1988), Draloric (1987), and Dale (1985). The former Spectrol Reliance factory in Swindon, England, (UK arm of Spectrol Electronics that was acquired by Vishay in 2000, originally known as Reliance Controls) was the last design by Team 4 (Richard Rogers, Norman Foster and their respective wives), and is considered the first example of High-tech architecture in the United Kingdom.

The dialogues, completed towards the end of Petrarch's life, are treasure-chests of wisdom and humour which have not lost their relevance despite the passing of six centuries. They display remarkably lucid ideas that are cogently expressed. Drawing on classical sources, Petrarch expounded on refinement in taste and intellect, on finesse and propriety in speech and style. The writing is a bouquet of moral philosophy, set out to show how thought and deed can generate happiness on the one hand, or sorrow and disillusionment on the other. In a recurring theme throughout the dialogues, Petrarch advises humility in prosperity and fortitude in adversity. The 254 woodcut illustrations by the anonymous Master of Petrarch for the 1532 German edition are considered masterpieces of the German Renaissance. In 1579, the dialogues were translated into English by the Elizabethan physician Thomas Twyne (1543‚Äì1613) as Phisicke Against Fortune, and by Susannah Dobson in 1791 as Petrarch's View of Human Life.Antonella Braida, \\"Dobson , Susannah (d. 1795)\\", ODNB, Oxford University Press, 2004 Retrieved 7 October 2014, subscription required.

Similar loops can be found in lampbrush chromosomes (see Lampbrush chromosome) that are characteristic for the female germ cells of most animals, except mammals.

Early animal trials have also revealed that administration of zacopride can reduce preference for and consumption of ethanol. Zacopride was found to significantly increase aldosterone levels in human subjects for 180 minutes at a dose of 400 micrograms.

It is the most important subsidiary of the holding company Gruppo api (api Group), which also includes api Raffineria di Ancona SpA, api Energia SpA, Festival SpA, apioil Ltd, api GmbH and api Services Ltd. It is headquartered in Rome, Italy. Description The company was founded in Ancona in 1933 by Ferdinando Peretti. It operates as a strategic coordinator of all api group's activities, through the direct supplying of semi-finished crude oil and assigned in the production, the acquisition of finished products and their transport, the exchanges with other oil companies to optimize the distributive logistics, the complementary activity of trading of crude oil and by-products to clients, and the sale of all the by-products in Italy and to foreign countries. It also is dedicated to operate and develop oil and gas field properties. It owns a refinery in Ancona with a capacity of 3.9 million tonnes/year and an electric power plant of 250 MW. In 2005, it acquired the IP gas station chain from ENI. After a few years running the chains in parallel, it switched all its stations to a revamped IP image and now supplies around 4,200 filling stations (up from around 1,600 at the time of the acquisition) with a market share of 11%. In 2017, Total SA and ERG SpA signed an agreement with Anonima Petroli Italiana SpA, to sell the fuel marketing and refining assets in their TotalErg joint venture. Total has stated that the reason behind this divestment is that the Italian fuel market is highly fragmented and the company's expectations for profitability have not been met. The company derives its revenue from two main sources. Firstly, they distribute semi-finished crude oil products to customers to use in the rubber and other associated industries. These products are being sold in both domestic and international markets. Secondly, the company generates income from the ownership and operations of the IP gas station chain. After purchasing 2,600 gas stations from the company ENI, API currently manages over 4,200 gas stations, which are supported by the company's own oil products.

The UCDP is a leading provider of data on organized violence and armed conflict, and it is the oldest ongoing data collection project for civil war, with a history of almost 40 years. UCDP data are systematically collected and have global coverage, comparability across cases and countries, and long time series. Data are updated annually and are publicly available, free of charge. Furthermore, preliminary data on events of organized violence in Africa is released on a monthly basis. The UCDP's data is published annually in the Journal of Peace Research. The UCDP also makes its data publicly available through its interactive website, UCDP website.  Background  The UCDP began recording information on ongoing violent conflicts in the 1980s. It became clear that more systematic and global data on armed conflicts was necessary for conducting research in the expanding academic discipline of peace and conflict studies. Initially, the program collected data only on so-called \\"armed conflicts\\", defined as fighting exceeding 25 battle-related deaths between two actors of which at least one was a state. In later years, the data collection grew, and the program began collecting data on \\"non-state conflicts\\" (where neither actor is a state) and \\"one-sided violence\\" (where an organized actor attacks unarmed civilians). One of the leading researchers associated with the UCDP is Professor Peter Wallensteen that founded and led the program since its initiation until 31 July 2015. After this Wallensteen continued to serve as a Senior Advisor for the UCDP. Organization The UCDP is based at the Department of Peace and Conflict Research of Uppsala University in Sweden. The program is led by Associate Professor Magnus √ñberg, and employs approximately 10-15 research assistants and researchers. A number of scholars and Ph.D. candidates are also affiliated with the program. In addition to collecting data, the program disseminates knowledge on trends and dynamics of armed conflict to the public via lectures at academic and government forums, as well as through participating in conferences and exhibitions such as the Swedish Forum for Human Rights.  Cooperation  UCDP is part of several important collaborations, for instance the extensive and well-established collaborations with the Peace Research Institute Oslo (PRIO) in Norway. Additionally, UCDP works closely with the Violence Early-Warning System (ViEWS) project at Uppsala University, Sweden, as well as with Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem) and the Quality of Government Institute (QoG), both based at the University of Gothenburg, Sweden. UCDP was part of the European Network for Conflict Research (ENCoRE), a network funded by Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST) of the European Union, which included all the leading research institutes in Europe that conduct quantitative and data driven research on armed conflict. UCDP also had a long-standing cooperation with the Human Security Report Project (HSRP) in Vancouver, Canada during the years that the project was running. Usage of UCDP data Hundreds of scholars have used the UCDP's data for research. Aside from being widely used in research on peace and conflict at universities both in Sweden and abroad, UCDP data is also used in a number of other disciplines, including public health, business and economics, migration and diasporas, as well as in studies that focus on agriculture, biodiversity and fisheries to name a few examples. UCDP is prominently used by the United Nations, and serves as a main data source in high profile reports by organizations in the UN family including UN/WB, the World Bank, and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).United Nations; World Bank. 2018.

UCDP data is an integral part of the World Bank‚Äôs World Development Indicators, where it is the only indicator for measuring armed conflict and its levels of intensity, and the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) program. The data is used by numerous Swedish and foreign government agencies and by many international NGOs, e.g. Save the Children International,Save the Children, 2019, ‚ÄùStop the War on Children: Protecting Children in 21st Century Conflict‚Äù, Germany, https://www.stopwaronchildren.org/report.pdf. Small Arms Survey and GapMinder. UCDP data are included in the Global Peace Indexhttp://visionofhumanity.org/app/uploads/2017/06/GPI-2017-Report.pdf . of the Institute for Economics and Peace, and the Mo Ibrahim Foundation makes use of UCDP data for its index that assesses the quality of governance in African countries. UCDP data is frequently used by journalists. Some of the largest media outlets in Sweden recurrently interview UCDP staff, and UCDP data is regularly published in, among others, Dagens Nyheter, Svenska Dagbladet, and the main Swedish radio broadcaster, Sveriges Radio. In addition, UCDP is often used and referred to in international media regarding armed conflicts and organized violence, for instance in the BBC, The Guardian, and The Washington Post, as well as in some of the major international news agencies, such as Agence France-Presse (AFP) and Reuters. In 2016, UCDP was listed by The Guardian as one of the top ten best sources of data for international development research, among such sources as the UNDP‚Äôs Human Development Index and the International Monetary Fund‚Äôs data site and reports.  Publications  Since 1993, a list of all armed conflicts and a brief description of the major developments and trends in organized violence appears annually in the Journal of Peace Research. UCDP data was published in the SIPRI Yearbook in 1988-2017, and data on non-state conflicts appeared in the Human Security Report in 2004-2013. Data are also disseminated via the UCDP website.  UCDP Conflict Encyclopedia (UCDP Database)  UCDP operates and continuously updates its online database (UCDP Conflict Encyclopedia), an interactive database, that offers a web-based system for visualizing, handling and downloading data on armed conflicts and organized violence, free of charge. The website offers information on several aspects of armed conflict such as conflict dynamics, groups, actors, third party involvement, and conflict resolution and peace agreements. It is possible to find information about specific countries, conflicts and years of interest by using the intuitive world maps. A user can download ready-made datasets on organized violence and peacemaking from the UCDP Dataset Download Center, as well as customized data selections of the user¬¥s choice. There is also a public API where users can access UCDP data in a machine-readable format.  UCDP's definitions of organized violence  The program divides armed conflict into three categories: \\"state-based conflict\\", \\"non-state conflict\\", and \\"one-sided violence\\". State-based conflict refers to what most people intuitively perceive as \\"war\\"; fighting either between two states, or between a state and a rebel group that challenges it. The UCDP defines an armed state-based conflict as: \\"An armed conflict is a contested incompatibility that concerns government and/or territory where the use of armed force between two parties, of which at least one is the government of a state, results in at least 25 battle-related deaths in one calendar year\\". The program's definition differs somewhat from other data collection programs, such as the Correlates of War Project, which only counts conflicts where at least 1 000 deaths have been recorded during one calendar year. In UCDP, an armed conflict of this magnitude is labelled as having the intensity level of \\"war\\", whilst armed conflicts that reap between 25 and 999 battle-related deaths are seen as having the intensity of a \\"minor\\" armed conflict. Non-state conflicts are those conflicts in which none of the warring parties is a state. Examples of non-state conflicts include the Fatah‚ÄìHamas conflict, inter-ethnic group conflicts such as the Lou Nuer‚ÄìMurle conflict, and inter-cartel violence in the Mexican Drug War. One-sided violence is defined as: \\"The use of armed force by the government of a state or by a formally organized group against civilians which results in at least 25 deaths in a year‚Äù. Examples include actions by the governments of Sudan, Myanmar, and Syria against civilians, as well as actions of non-state organizations such as Los Zetas, al-Qaeda, and the Lord's Resistance Army against civilians. UCDP Data= Data collection = UCDP uses both printed and electronic public sources for gathering information. All sources are manually read. The main source is the Factiva Database that is composed of over 30 000 newspapers, newswires, and other sources from around the globe. As a minimum, for each country, UCDP uses at least one of the global newswires (AFP, Reuters, AP, Xinhua, or Agencia EFE) in addition to BBC Monitoring. Additional sources include newly published books, case studies, journals like Africa Research Bulletin, research reports, documents of international and multinational organizations, publications by NGOs such as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, and documents of fighting parties. Sources are evaluated according to the context in which they are published, and reports are traced back to the primary source to establish reliability. UCDP staff members manually codes approximately 10 000-12 000 events on an annual basis. = UCDP Georeferenced Event Dataset (GED) = This is one of UCDP's core dataset and it is the most disaggregated one. The GED covers individual events of organized violence (the phenomena of lethal violence occurring at a given time and place). These events are sufficiently fine-grained to have several spatial and temporal locators, such as place name, administrative division, and geographic coordinates down to the level of individual villages, as well as start and end dates, disaggregated to single, individual days. The dataset is updated annually by UCDP. = UCDP/PRIO Armed Conflict Dataset = The UCDP/PRIO Armed Conflict Dataset is a joint project between the UCDP and PRIO that records armed conflicts from 1946 that result in a minimum of 25 battle-related deaths and in which at least one actor is the government of a state. The dataset is updated annually by UCDP. = UCDP Dyadic Dataset = The UCDP Dyadic Dataset is a dyad-year version of the UCDP/PRIO Armed Conflict Dataset. A dyad consists of two opposing actors in an armed conflict where at least one party is the government of a state. The dataset is updated annually by UCDP. = UCDP Battle-Related Deaths Dataset = This dataset contains information on the number of battle-related deaths in the conflicts from that appear in the UCDP/PRIO Armed Conflict Dataset. The dataset is updated annually. Typically, battle-related deaths occur in what can be described as \\"normal\\" warfare involving the armed forces of the warring parties. This includes traditional battlefield fighting, guerrilla activities (e.g. hit-and-run attacks / ambushes) and all kinds of bombardments of military units, cities and villages etc. The targets are usually the military itself and its installations, or state institutions and state representatives, but there is often substantial collateral damage in the form of civilians killed in crossfire, indiscriminate bombings etc. All deaths - military as well as civilian - incurred in such situations, are counted as battle-related deaths. Fatality figures may be substantially lower than other stated estimates as UCDP data does not include fatalities from disease and/or war- time epidemics, or combine casualty figures between different types of armed conflicts. = UCDP Non-State Conflict Dataset = The UCDP Non-Sate Conflict Dataset contains information on communal and organized armed conflict where none of the parties is a government of a state.The dataset is updated annually by UCDP. A non-state armed conflict is defined by UCDP as ‚ÄúThe use of armed force between two organized armed groups, neither of which is the government of a state, which results in at least 25 battle-related deaths in a year.‚Äù. = UCDP One-sided Violence Dataset = The UCDP One-sided Violence Dataset is an actor-year dataset with information on intentional attacks on civilians by governments and formally organized armed groups.The dataset is updated annually by UCDP. One-sided violence is defined by UCDP as ‚ÄúThe use of armed force by the government of a state or by a formally organized group against civilians which results in at least 25 deaths in a year.‚Äù See also *Casualty recording *Correlates of War *PRIO *Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project ReferencesExternal links *UCDP website *UCDP database Peace and conflict studies Aftermath of war Uppsala University Research institutes in Sweden Research institutes of international relations ","title":"Uppsala Conflict Data Program"},{"id":"18537948","text":"Puliyakot Keshava Menon (1917 - 22 October 1979) was an Indian mathematician best known as Director of the Joint Cipher Bureau.Puliyakot Kesava Menon (1917-1979) (Bull.

The founders were a mix of native Jews and immigrants from the United States. It was named after the South African politician Jan Smuts, who was a prominent supporter of Zionism and a personal friend of Chaim Weizmann.A kibbutz called Jan Smuts Upon graduating high school in 1940, Yitzhak Rabin joined the kibbutz's Noar Ha‚Äôoved (Working Youth) training program.Biography of Yitzhak Rabin It was the location of the Battle of Ramat Yohanan during the 1947‚Äì1948 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine. The Druze regiment of the Arab Liberation Army were confronted by the Haganah soldiers. During the battle the defenders ran out of ammunition and fought with knives before they were re- supplied. Subsequently, the Druze ran out of ammunition and withdrew to their base in Shefa-'Amr with many casualties. As a result of their defeat, many Druze swapped sides in the conflict, and began co-operating with the Haganah. Economy The kibbutz grows produce including mainly avocado, lychee and citrus fruits. The kibbutz has large dairy farm of 600 milk cows, thousand acres of fields, and a large chicken breeding farm. The main economical power of the kibbutz comes from the company Palram, which mainly manufactures plastic sheets for the building industry. Beginning in the 1970s, Ramat Yohanan hosted an ulpan program. In recent years aimed primarily at American and Russian students, the program ceased operating in 2017 mostly due to Israeli government changes to immigration evaluations.

It is one of the most expensive infrastructure undertakings in Hong Kong history. The line connects Kowloon with the high-speed rail network of China at Futian station in Shenzhen, then running north towards the commercial hub of Guangzhou. The railway is the first high-speed rail link between mainland China and Hong Kong; it roughly halved travel time between Hong Kong and Guangzhou, and connected Hong Kong to most major mainland Chinese cities via the country's extensive high-speed railway network. Construction began in 2011 and was hampered by construction delays and political controversy. It opened for commercial service on 23 September 2018. Unlike the rest of Hong Kong, the passenger compartments of trains operating on the Hong Kong Express Rail Link are legally defined as part of the Mainland Port Area and subject to the laws of mainland China. History In April 2007, the Executive Council assigned the task of planning and design of the Hong Kong section of the Guangzhou‚ÄìShenzhen‚ÄìHong Kong Express Rail Link (XRL) to the MTR Corporation Limited (MTRCL). Government projections indicate that the XRL will carry about 100,000 passengers daily in 2020 and 120,000 passengers in 2030, generating an economic benefit of HK$83 billion over the next 50 years in terms of travelling time saved. Construction costs were estimated at HK$39.5 billion (US$5 billion), giving an economic internal rate of return of about 9%. The government stated the objectives were to \\"reinforce Hong Kong's position as the transport hub in southern China and integrate Hong Kong into Mainland China's rapidly growing express rail network\\", and promoting cultural tourism. It also argued that shortening the travelling time between Hong Kong and Guangzhou to just under 50 minuteshalf the current journey time would save \\"HK$83 billion over the next 50 years in terms of travelling time\\", and the creation of 5,000 jobs during construction, and 10,000 operational jobs. =Development= The construction cost in Hong Kong was covered by the Hong Kong taxpayer (whereas the construction cost in the Mainland section will be covered by the Guangdong Provincial Government and PRC's Ministry of Railways). Hoping to be able to start construction of the Hong Kong section of the Express Rail Link (XRL) project before the end of 2009, the Executive Council approved the implementation on 20 October, paving the way for funding approval from the Finance Committee of the Legislative Council.ExCo approves implementation of high-speed rail link, Hong Kong Government, 20 October 2009 Appropriations for the project secured approval of the Hong Kong Legislative Council on 16 January 2010.Song, Shengxia (18 January 2010), Hongkongers protest vote on high-speed rail, People's Daily, Global Times. Retrieved 28 January 2010 =Service= The XRL HK Section will only serve the West Kowloon Terminus. Trains will run to Guangzhou South Station in the Shibi Township of the Panyu District in southern Guangzhou through three intermediate stations, namely, Futian, Longhua (Shenzhen North) and Humen. The expected travel time between Guangzhou South and West Kowloon stations is estimated to be 1 hour and 18 minutes, up from the previously announced 47 minutes with a total distance of 142 kilometers. Shenzhen North Station was open on 22 June 2011 and the service was extended to Futian Station on 30 December 2015. Trains departing from Hong Kong may have destinations beyond Guangzhou, through the Wuguang High-Speed Railway and the Shiwu High-Speed Railway, or via Shenzhen North to Hangzhou and Shanghai through the Xiashen Railway and the Huhangyong Railway. The total distance of the Hong Kong section was planned to be 26 kilometres, most of which through tunnels. The dedicated track will enable a top speed of 200 km/h; the expected travel time from Kowloon to Shenzhen's Futian Station is 14 minutes. Service between Guangzhou South and Shenzhen North stations started on 26 December 2011.\\"High-speed rail to link Shenzhen, Guangzhou.\\" China Daily/Asia News Network. 25 December 2011. via AsiaOne.com The extension to Futian station, originally scheduled for 2012, was delayed until on 30 December 2015 for Futian and the 3rd quarter of 2018 during the planning process for West Kowloon Terminus.  Controversies  The completion of the XRL HK section had been delayed on multiple occasions and continuously ran over budget, attracting criticisms from many Hong Kong protestors. Being part of the Chinese Rail Link network, with the start of commercial operations in the Hong Kong section, the Chinese authorities have created checkpoints both on the trains to Hong Kong and at the Hong Kong West Kowloon railway station, in a \\"Mainland Port Area\\" where Chinese criminal laws can be legally enforced for the first time in Hong Kong territory, as part of the bill passed in June 2018. =Protests= On 29 November 2009, a demonstration of more than 1,000 people protesting against the construction of the Express Rail link gained the attention of the local media when a group of 100 people engaged in a sit-in protest in front of the government headquarters in Central.Angry rail-link protesters clash with police , The Standard, 30 November 2009 On 18 December 2009, when the funding application was debated in the Finance Committee of the Legislative Council, a demonstration of an estimated 1,000 to 2,000 people was staged around the Legislative Council Building.

History  Danieli‚Äôs origins date to 1914 when two brothers Mario and Timo Danieli founded the Angelini Steelworks in Brescia, Italy, one of the first companies to use the electric arc furnace for steel making.https://industrytoday.com/article/company-of-steel/ In 1929, part of the steelworks was transferred to Buttrio to manufacture tools for forging plants and auxiliary machines for rolling mills. In 1955, led by Luigi Danieli, the company started designing and manufacturing equipment for the steel industry. His idea was to manufacture more competitive equipment, simplify layouts and maximize the use of automation. One of the concepts developed, the \\"EAF/Conticaster-Rolling mill\\" production route, has characterized and contributed to the successful development of the minimill process, which is widely adopted today. In 1982, the company was listed on the Milan Stock Exchange, and in 1984 (who had managed the financial and administrative departments of the Group since 1977) - who was appointed Chairman - and Gianpietro Benedetti (who had been Technological, Commercial and Project execution director since 1977) - who was appointed CEO - were entrusted with the management of the company. Since then Danieli has acquired German (Josef Fr√∂hling), Swedish (Morg√•rdshammar), British (Davy Distington), French (Rotelec), American (Wean Industries, United Engineering), and Dutch (Corus Technical Services) companies. At the end of the 1990s the internationalization process was completed with the construction of production centers in China, Thailand, Vietnam, and India, followed by Russia, Turkey, and Brazil, all of which were added to the European plants already existing in Italy, Sweden, and Germany. Beginning in 1969, through Danieli Automation, the company developed its own automation systems, including instrumentation and power control technologies. In 2005, the company started a transformation program and expanded into developing countries by establishing fully owned and directly managed design and production centers. In 1995, Danieli acquired a local steelmaking company, ABS, which is also used as a laboratory for metallurgy, equipment, processes, and their related automation. center See also *List of Italian companies References External links  * Italian companies established in 1914 Manufacturing companies established in 1914 Danieli Group Italian brands Engineering companies of Italy Multinational companies headquartered in Italy Steel companies of Italy Industrial machine manufacturers ","title":"Danieli"},{"id":"18537997","text":"Dark Shadows: Clothes of Sand is a Big Finish Productions original dramatic reading based on the long-running American horror soap opera series Dark Shadows.

It is headquartered in Wimbledon, London, England. The organisation was founded in 1913 - it is the world's oldest association in its field and has over 150,000 members internationally working across private, public and voluntary sectors. Peter Cheese was announced in June 2012 as CIPD's new CEO from July 2012.Personnel Today \\"CIPD Appoints Peter Cheese as new chief executive\\" 16 May 2012 CIPD What's New History=Origins= In the United Kingdom, factory inspectors were appointed for the first time in 1893. In 1896 to look after its women and child workers Rowntree's appointed their first inspector - a Mrs E M Wood. Edward Cadbury of Cadbury Brothers in 1909 called together employers to discuss industrial welfare work and as a result 25 employers formed an association with Mrs Wood of Rowntree's as Secretary. The work of 'welfare workers' came to public attention during a trade show in 1912 at Olympia in London. The forerunner of the CIPD, the Welfare Workers' Association (WWA) was formed at an employers' conference in York on 6 June 1913. The meeting was chaired by Seebohm Rowntree. Alongside his company, Rowntree's around fifty other companies were present including; Boots, Cadbury and Chivers and Sons.HRD Happy 100th anniversary CIPD, Accessed 09 February 2015 Thirty-four of the employers present decided that the WWA be founded as...an association of employers interested in industrial betterment and of welfare workers engaged by them. The outbreak of World War I in 1914 led to many women and children taking up the work of men, particularly in the larger munition factories where the appointment of welfare officers was made compulsory by legislation and was monitored by the Health of Munition Workers Committee. This led to the rapid expansion of female welfare workers. There were concerns about the training of welfare staff, and in 1917, at a gathering in Leeds of the seven welfare associations formed during the period it was agreed that they merge by forming the Central Association of Welfare Workers which to accommodate the regional associations established the beginnings of a local branch structure. The Association's position was also enhanced during the war years by nationally driven encouragement of workers to join trade unions to reduce the occurrence of industrial strife. Another development which increased the numbers of company staff dealing with labour and welfare matters occurred with the inclusion of managers, mainly men, from the North-western Area Industrial Association to assist with discipline, dismissal and industrial relations in increasingly unionised organisations. In 1918, to avoid confusion as to its purpose the Association changed its name to the Central Association of Welfare Workers (Industrial) (CAWWI). Another important event which had a recurring impact on the activities of the CAWWI occurred in 1918 when the Rev. Robert Hyde founded the Boys‚Äô Welfare Association soon after renamed the Industrial Welfare Society (IWS) with six employers who were concerned with the welfare of boys employed or apprenticed in the shipbuilding industry. From the outset there was a strained relationship between the two bodies which continued right through the inter-war period until resolved in 1946. Though both organisations were concerned with 'welfare at work' the CAWWI developed as an institution for practitioners and the IWS was established as a membership body for employers and there was strong disagreement on how best to bring about improvements in workplace conditions and workers' welfare. The IWS later became the Industrial Society and is now known as the Work Foundation.Labour Management vs Welfare Work Alistair Evans PHd Thesis, University of West London, 2003, Retrieved 10 February 2015 =The post-World War I period= In November 1919, following merger with welfare associations for men the Central Association of Welfare Workers (Industrial) was renamed the Welfare Workers' Institute and now had a membership of 700. However, the next five years saw a reduction in membership to 250 coinciding with the rapid collapse in industrial output as the government sought to reduce the national debt. Again in 1924 on incorporation the organisation changed its name to the Institute of Industrial Welfare Workers (IIWW). Minnie Louise Haskins, the author of the famous poem The Gate of the Year and a lecturer at LSE, was closely involved with the IIWW and edited its monthly bulletin. As a consequence of the activities of welfare workers during the General Strike of 1926 distrust in the welfare movement grew amongst trade unions which saw a new breed of 'labour managers' part of 'management' which was reflected in 1931 when the IIWW became the Institute of Labour Management and its magazine, rebranded Labour Management. Members of the institute experienced new demands during the 1930s. Firstly, economic growth resulted in a shortfall in skilled labour as companies competed to recruit workers. Secondly, this was followed by lay-offs and industrial action as a worldwide depression took hold, particularly in the industrially-focussed north of England. This influence also had the effect of increasing the number of male members of the institute which significantly shifted the gender balance of the membership. Thirdly, new human relations practices developed in the US were finding their way into more enlightened business which invested in their employees through training and provision of such things as salary benefits, pensions and paid holidays. In 1938 the first of the institute branches opened in the Republic of Ireland. In 1939 membership stood at 760. Mirroring the First World War during World War II, the government insisted on personnel officers to be deployed in factories engaged in war-related production. =The latter part of 20th century= Directly after the Second World War the incoming Labour government instigated a policy of industry nationalization and launched the National Health Service, further increasing the role of personnel professions in handling public sector recruitment, retention, payroll, training, and industrial relations issues. The enlightened practices of large American corporations, some of which had adopted the ideas of human relations thinkers, such as Elton Mayo, and the Civil Service in the field of personnel management were being taken up by the larger UK companies. Both influences were reflected in a further change of name in 1946 to the Institute of Personnel Management (IPM).Qualifying Associations IIs by Geoffrey Millerson, Accessed 09 February 2014 The 1950s were marked by government efforts to improve productivity both through introducing more modern management practices and increase labor supply through encouraging migration of people from the British Commonwealth also known as the Windrush generation. In 1955, responding to these changes, the IPM sought to increase the professional standards and standing of its members by introducing an externally moderated examination scheme, and restricting entry to full membership to fully qualified or practising personnel officers over age 35 with several years' experience. Membership in 1956 stood at 3,979. During the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s influences on the UK workplace ranged from a series of technological revolutions, economic pressures from entry into the Common Market and impact of globalization, deregulation of the financial services industry (the Big Bang). Government intervention in industrial relations and the growth of health and safety, equality, collective and recruitment and employment legislation encouraged new specialisms to develop in the function. In some companies a shift was seen from reactive personnel management processes towards what became known as strategic human resource management practices, or in shorthand HRM. All these factors also influenced a steady increase in membership, which in 1987 was 31,400. The IPM underwent a period of contemplation during which it considered whether; to shift towards an HRM approach as its counterpart in the US the Society for Human Resource Management had already done, or to maintain its focus on the more traditional personnel management practices where the majority of its members still operated, or find a third way reflecting a more UK-focused approach. In 1994, a merger took place between the IPM and the Institute of Training and Development (ITD). The new organisation which had 70,000 members was named the Institute of Personnel and Development (IPD), sought to represent the range of professionals engaged in one or more elements of people management.A potted history of work-related ideas and events CIPD June 1913 , Accessed 09 February 2015 =Chartered status= Chartered status was achieved in 2000 and the IPD was incorporated under Royal Charter from 1 July of that year to become known as the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD) and reported it had a membership of 120,000 practitioners.Annual report. (1994-1999) London: Institute of Personnel and Development [and] Annual Report. (2000-2004/5) London Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development. In June 2013 the CIPD commemorated its centenary year. CIPD membership As of November 2019 the CIPD reported it had over 150,000 members working or studying in the UK and internationally. Following the re-designation of chartered and non-chartered membership status in 2010 the membership structure comprises:CIPD Transforming Membership - New membership criteria accessed:26.04.10 =Professional membershipsChartered grades= * Chartered Companion (CCIPD) By invitation only, awarded in recognition of contributions to the profession or the institute. * Chartered Member (MCIPD) Awarded on request to graduate members who have three years' relevant managerial experience. Or a non- graduate member assessed against the professional standards after five years' relevant experience (though experience assessment). To achieve Chartered Member status, you'll need to demonstrate at least three years‚Äô current experience working consistently at this level. Your role may include elements of developing people strategy, but you'll also be operational, planning and managing HR activity. * Chartered Fellow (FCIPD) An upgrade from Chartered MCIPD, applicants must have at least 10 years relevant experience. To achieve Chartered Fellow status, you'll need to demonstrate at least three years‚Äô current experience working consistently at a senior level. The scope of your role will be strategic in nature, with an impact across many functions; you'll rarely work operationally. = Non-chartered grades = * Associate (Assoc CIPD) This Associate grade was introduced in 2010 and has since replaced the Licentiate grade in 2010 and Graduate level which was phased out in 2014. If you're currently a Student member you'll be awarded Associate membership when you successfully complete your CIPD-approved Certificate or Diploma. Associate membership is the first level of HR certification and professionalism in the HR/L&D; field. * Affiliate: a basic level of membership, not assessed against professional standards but relevant qualification and work experience is mandatory. * Student Membership You're normally undertaking a CIPD-approved Certificate or Diploma and have not had a higher membership level prior to that. =Academic memberships= To be eligible for Academic Membership of the CIPD you need to be an individual working in the field of teaching or research in HRM or an HRM related area. =Chartered grades= * Academic Member (Academic MCIPD) Typically an experienced lecturer, senior researcher, recognized in the UK or internationally as an expert in more than one relevant HR or L&D; subject area. * Academic Fellow (Academic FCIPD) Typically a senior academic or research leader, recognized in the UK or internationally as an expert in at least two areas of HR or L&D.; =Non-chartered grades= * Academic Associate (Academic Assoc CIPD) Typically an experienced lecturer, tutor or researcher in an HR or L&D; subject area.  Accreditation  CIPD is also a training provider of professional HR and L&D; qualification. As such, the non profit registered charity is incorporated with a Royal Charters and is listed as an awarding body and learning provider of professional qualification which is officially recognized by the government of United Kingdom's Ofqual, CCEA and Qualification Wales. This mean the CIPD qualifications are recognized nationally and internationally. This also gives CIPD accreditation powers to choose which universities meet their strict requirements for accreditation of undergraduate, postgraduate, MSC, HR and L&D; programmes, which is highly sought out by UK and International universities. Research On an annual basis the institute conducts regular surveys on reward management, employee expectations and attitudes to pay and benefits, resourcing and talent planning, and learning and development. The CIPD's 2015 research programme includes specific projects on; the behavioural sciences and learning, people management in small and medium-sized enterprises, social media and technology impacts in the workplace, leadership and management development, valuing the impact of an organisation's people on business performance, the 'megatrends' shaping the labour market and the future workplace. Periodic research reports are published for members on the results from surveys and the findings from research projects.What's new from CIPD research CIPD, Accessed 10 February 2015 Public policy The CIPD contributes on public policy issues on behalf of its members by using its in-house research team and draws on the professional experience of its members to develop responses to public policy issues including government consultations. It researches and publishes surveys and responds to media enquiries on the range of human resource issues such as labour markets, reward and employment policy.Dissecting the latest CIPD Labour Market Outlook report January 2014 , Accessed 10 February 2015Business First August 2014 , Accessed 10 February 2014 Commentating on labour market economics and trends has become an increasingly important feature of the CIPD's services to members.

The PSD directive's purpose was to increase pan-European competition and participation in the payments industry also from non-banks, and to provide for a level playing field by harmonizing consumer protection and the rights and obligations for payment providers and users. The key objectives of the PSD2 directive are creating a more integrated European payments market, making payments safer and more secure and protecting consumers. Overview The SEPA (Single Euro Payments Area) is a self-regulatory initiative by the European banking sector represented in the European Payments Council, which defines the harmonization of payment products, infrastructures and technical standards (Rulebooks for credit transfer/direct debit, BIC, IBAN, ISO 20022 XML message format, EMV chip cards/terminals). The PSD provides the legal framework within which all payment service providers must operate. The PSD's purpose in regard to the payments industry was to increase pan-European competition with participation also from non-banks, and to provide for a level playing field by harmonizing consumer protection and the rights and obligations for payment providers and users. The PSD's purpose in regard to consumers was to increase customer rights, guarantee faster payments (no later than next day since 1 January 2012), describe refund rights, and give clearer information on payments. Although the PSD was a maximum harmonisation directive, certain elements allowed for different options by individual countries. The final adopted text of PSD went into force 25 December 2007 and was transposed into national legislation by all EU and EEA member states by 1 November 2009. =Technical overview= The PSD contained two main sections: # The 'market rules' described which type of organizations could provide payment services. Next to credit institutions (i.e. banks) and certain authorities (e.g. central banks, government bodies), the PSD mentioned electronic money institutions (EMI), created by the E-Money Directive in 2000, and created the new category of 'payment institutions' (PI) with its own prudential regime rules. Organizations that are neither credit institutions or EMIs could apply for an authorization as a payment institution if they met certain capital and risk management requirements. The application could be made in any EU country where they are established and they could then \\"passport\\" their payment services into all other EU member states without additional PI requirements. # The 'business conduct rules' specified what transparency of information payment service institutions needed to provide, including any charges, exchange rates, transaction references and maximum execution time. It stipulated the rights and obligations for both payment service providers and users, how to authorize and execute transactions, liability in case of unauthorized use of payment instruments, refunds on payments, revoking payment orders, and value dating of payments. Each country had to designate a 'competent authority' for prudential supervision of the PIs and to monitor compliance with business conduct rules, as transposed into national legislation. =Updates= The PSD was updated in 2009 (EC Regulation 924/2009) and 2012 (EU Regulation 260/2012). An implementation report from 2013 found the PSD facilitated \\"provision of uniform payment services across the EU\\" and reduced legal and production costs for many payment service providers and that \\"the expected benefits have not yet been fully realised\\". The same report found the 2009 update \\"to be functioning well. For example, charges for ‚Ç¨100 transfers followed a further downward trend to ‚Ç¨0.50 euro-area average for transfers initiated online and remained low, at ‚Ç¨3.10 for transfers initiated at the bank counter\\". =Remaining issues= # The PSD only applied to payments within the European Economic Area, but not to transactions to or from third countries. # PSD exemptions related to payment activities left users unprotected. # The PSD option for merchants to charge a fee or give a rebate, combined with the option for countries to limit this, led to \\"extreme heterogeneity in the market\\". # So-called \\"third party payment service providers\\" emerged, which facilitated online shopping by offering low cost payment solutions on the Internet by using the customers' home online banking application with their agreement, and informing merchants that the money is on its way. Other 'account information services' offer consolidated information on different accounts of a payments service user. Harmonisation of refund rules regarding direct debits, a reduction of the scope of the \\"simplified regime\\" for so- called \\"small payment institutions\\" and addressing security, access to information on payment accounts or data privacy with possible licensing and supervision were proposed. =Revised Directive on Payment Services (PSD2)= On 8 October 2015, the European Parliament adopted the European Commission proposal to create safer and more innovative European payments (PSD2, Directive (EU) 2015/2366). The current rules aim to better protect consumers when they pay online, promote the development and use of innovative online and mobile payments such as through open banking, and make cross-border European payment services safer. Then-Commissioner Jonathan Hill, responsible for Financial Stability, Financial Services and Capital Markets Union, said, \\"This legislation is a step towards a digital single market; it will benefit consumers and businesses, and help the economy grow.\\" On 16 November 2015, the Council of the European Union passed PSD2. Member states then had two years to incorporate the directive into their national laws and regulations. On 27 November 2017, Commission delegated Regulation (EU) 2018/389 supplemented PSD2 with regard to regulatory technical standards for strong customer authentication and common and secure open standards of communication. The EU and many banks pushed this development with the new Payments Service Directive 2 (PSD2), which came into force on 13 January 2018. Banks then adapted to these changes which opened many technical challenges, but also many strategic opportunities, such as collaborating with fintech providers, for the future. An important element of PSD2 is the requirement for strong customer authentication on the majority of electronic payments. Another important element of the directive is the demand for common and secure communication (CSC). eIDAS-defined qualified certificates for are demanded for website authentication and electronic seals used for communication between financial services players. The technical specification ETSI TS 119 495 defines a standard for implementing these requirements. PSD2 went into full effect on 14 September 2019, but due to delays in the implementation, the European Banking Authority allowed for a time extension of the strong customer authentication (SCA) until 31 December 2020.

In DACs, it is a measure of the deviation between the ideal output value and the actual measured output value for a certain input code. In ADCs, it is the deviation between the ideal input threshold value and the measured threshold level of a certain output code. This measurement is performed after offset and gain errors have been compensated.Sansen, Willy Analog Design Essentials (2006), Springer. Page 605. The ideal transfer function of a DAC or ADC is a straight line. The INL measurement depends on what line is chosen as ideal. One common option is the line that connects the endpoints of the transfer function, in other words, the line connecting the smallest and largest measured input/output value. An alternative is to use a best fit line, where one minimizes the average (or alternatively the mean squared) INL. While the INL can be measured for every possible input/output code, often only the maximal error is provided when reporting the INL of a converter.Johns, David A. and Martin, Ken. Analog Integrated Circuit Design (1997), Wiley. Page 456.

In 2018 Leadiant Biosciences has come under fire for creating a monopoly for CDCA and unnecessarily increasing the price by a factor of 335. Construction began in 1964 of an industrial facility in Pomezia equipped with state-of-the-art automatic production machinery to provide steady employment for 64 people. The choice of Pomezia for its headquarters created one of the first industrialization and urban development initiatives in an area of Central- southern Italy that had previously been mainly devoted to agriculture. With the creation and launch of the Rekord B12 vitamin complex in September 1966 ‚Äì an antiasthenic medicine that soon spread within the field of restorative infantile therapies ‚Äì Sigma-Tau definitively asserted itself as a pharmaceutical manufacturer in Italy and abroad.  From the 1970s to today  From the 1970s onwards, Sigma-Tau focused on experimenting with new medicines for rare diseases ‚Äì a commitment that in 1984 would cause it to become the fourth largest pharmaceutical company in the world and assignee in the United States of an Orphan Drug Designation,Orphan drugs are medicines that are effective in the treatment of certain diseases that are not manufactured or put on the market due to insufficient demand to cover production costs and supply. subsequently receiving another seven. With the discovery in the 1970s of , an illness with a fatal outcome, Sigma-Tau focused the investigative efforts of its laboratories on research into a molecule capable of opposing the disease. This was to bring about the creation of L-carnitine, one of the few Italian pharmaceutical products widely received outside Italy, and which was recognized by the United States in 1984 for its value as a life saving medicine. The chemical and biologic pharmacology study of carnitine, a substance of natural origin, enabled greater understanding of its efficacy in correcting the biochemical and metabolic defects at the base of numerous other pathologies. Fondazione Sigma-Tau was created in 1986 as a charitable organization with the aim of developing research, promoting scientific and cultural progress and the safeguarding of the results of scientific investigation. Structure of Sigma-Tau group The Sigma-Tau Group achieved a corporate turnover of 697 million euro in 2013, employs a workforce of 1,919 and possesses a portfolio of more than 100 products marketed in Italy and abroad, with regards to the following therapeutic areas: Cardiometabolic disorders, Orthopedic and Rheumatologic diseases, Broncho-Pneumology, Infectology, Oncology, Neurology, Gastroenterology, Dermatology, Urology and Gynecology, Malaria and Rare Diseases. The Group is a leader in the nutraceutics industry and produces supplements of high scientific interest. Its product range also includes high-end dermocosmetics lines, as well as oral and personal care products. Since 1998 it has filed 297 patents confirming itself, among the national Italian owned, as a major player in the registration of new molecules or important technological innovations. The Sigma-Tau Group has headquarters in Pomezia (Rome, Italy), and subsidiaries in France, Switzerland, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, UK, India, and with production plant in Italy as well as in Spain and US (Indianapolis). The ability to expand its presence on the international stage, mainly through the activation of collaborative research with numerous scientific institutions in America, Europe and Asia, is the key to Sigma-Tau‚Äôs future. Since the pioneering studies conducted by its founder Claudio Cavazza, Sigma-Tau has always proved to be a groundbreaker in the discovery of drugs for rare and orphan diseases: for instance, Carnitine for the treatment of primary or secondary ‚Äúspecific deficiencies‚Äù was the second product ever to obtain the designation as ‚Äúorphan drug‚Äù by the US FDA. Leveraging this background, the company has confirmed its commitment to developing drugs with orphan indications over the years and has acquired Enzon‚Äôs ‚Äúspeciality pharma‚Äù portfolio. With eight products for the treatment of rare and neglected diseases, today Sigma-Tau is a pharmaceutic player acting in the forefront in the treatment of Rare Diseases. The goal of its recently created Global Rare Disease Business Unit is to contribute to the progresses in the knowledge, diagnosis and treatment of Rare Diseases. Sigma-Tau in collaboration with the non-profit organization Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV) has developed a new medicine for the treatment of malaria a fixed combination consisting of dihydroartemisinin and piperaquine, judged to be one of the most effective antimalaria medicines available and the best combination containing artemisinin. The registration dossier was presented on July 3, 2009 in Europe (EMEA)and approved in 2011. The new drug has obtained the registration in Cambodia, Ghana and Tanzania and is started in Burkina Faso, Mozambique and other key African endemic countries. Sigma-Tau is the main element of a group in which other companies operate, in accordance with the prospects of the corporate development plan. *Avantgarde - Pomezia Founded in 1982 and active both in the pharmaceutical market and that of consumer products sold in pharmacies. Avantgarde has developed its business within the dermatological, gynaecological and paediatric sectors; for consumer products the focus is geared to dermocosmetic sector and to oral hygiene with OTC products. *Biosint - Sermoneta Incorporated in 1979 as part of the Sigma-Tau Group, Biosint is currently a world-leading producer of L-Carnitine derived by chemical synthesis.

Social responsibilities While the company claims to operate in absolute respect of ethical principles and existing legislation it received a tremendous amount of negative attention due their action to increase the price of an orphan drug to such extent it became impossible to pay for the drug. Environmental responsibilities In 1967 Sigma-Tau became equipped with a water conditioning plant. Since 2005, the commitment to reduce impact on the environment in the elimination of solvents in aid of water in many preparations has produced continuing reduction in CO2 emissions that have fallen from 5,932 tons to 5,587 in 2007. Since 2007, Sigma-Tau has begun waste sorting and choosing eco-compatible materials. In the same year, in which Sigma-Tau‚Äôs environmental costs amounted to around 600,000 euros, a reduction of 8% in the quantity of industrial wastewater was confirmed. Humanitarian commitment The Pharmaceutical Accountability Foundation accused the company of abusing its dominant market position when it increased the price of chenodeoxycholic acid from ‚Ç¨0.28 per capsule to ‚Ç¨140 per capsule in 2018. They said ‚ÄúThis may be legal but it‚Äôs not socially acceptable.‚Äù They said they would make a referral to the Netherlands Authority for Consumers and Markets. Over the years, Sigma-Tau has developed numerous partnerships, formed with associations and bodies engaged ‚Äì at national and international level ‚Äì in projects and activities with a social emphasis, with particular focus on the areas of health and social welfare. The company also provides its medicines free-of-charge to around 40 national and international organizations operating in conflict and post-conflict contexts to support those people stricken by natural disasters and famine.

Photo by Ernest Brooks. Over 50 contracted and former Celtic F.C. players fought in World War I, seven of whom died. Of those that fought, William Angus was awarded the Victoria Cross for bravery in battle.  Background  In the early 20th Century Celtic F.C. was already a successful club having won 10 Scottish League Championships and 8 Scottish Cups in their 26-year history (by 1914). Celtic won the league four times in a row during World War I. During this run of league championships, Celtic went 62 matches unbeaten from 20 November 1915 until 14 April 1917, a record in British football that stood for a century. However, football was not as important due to the War effort; attendances fell, player's salaries were reduced and there was increased pressure to complete the fixture list. On one occasion in 1916, during their 62 match unbeaten run, Celtic had to play two matches on the same day against Raith Rovers and Motherwell, and won both 6‚Äì0 and 3‚Äì1 respectively. Recruitment drives were also held at football matches and on one occasion an exhibition of trench warfare was held at Celtic Park. Over 50 contracted and former Celtic players served in the war. Of the 908,371 British and Commonwealth soldiers who died in the fighting, six were former Celtic players whilst one was still a contracted player at the club. The fallen were Patrick Slavin, Leigh Richmond Roose, Donnie McLeod, Archie McMillan, Bob Craig, John McLaughlin and Peter Johnstone. Roose and Slavin died in the Battle of the Somme (1916), four others died in 1917 and Craig died in 1918. The men who died Roose pictured in a Stoke City team photograph c.1904. From Association Football and the Men Who Made It (1906). =Leigh Roose= Roose was a Welsh goalkeeper who played a trial match for Celtic in 1910. He had 24 caps for Wales and a Doctorate in Bacteriology before he joined the 9th Royal Fusiliers in 1914. He rose to the rank of Lance Corporal and was awarded the Military Medal before his death on 7 October 1916 between the hours of 1.45pm and 9.00pm in the Battle for Montauban. His regiment was sent to attack the enemy line and it is believed that he died as a result of heavy machine gun fire and shelling when his regiment came under attack (he is recorded as missing on the Thiepval Memorial). On that day it is recorded 25 died, 165 missing and 132 wounded. =Patrick Slavin= Slavin was the second former player to die. He rose to the rank of Sergeant and was with the 2nd Battalion Royal Scots and died 13 November 1916, in the 2nd Battle for the village of Serre. The day he died it was reported that there was thick fog by 5 am and that the enemy's barbed wire was not cut, he is reported to have been shot dead after \\"going over the top\\", that day 23 died, 84 missing and 177 wounded. =John McLaughlin= McLaughlin's records are scant which is an indication that he may never have made a first team appearance for Celtic. However, it is known that he played for Mossend Hibs and Renton. He held the rank of private and was in the 11th Battalion of the Highland Light Infantry. He was injured on 23 April 1917 when his battalion came under fire at the Battle of Calvary Farm at Monchy Le Preux which is north of Arras. He did not survive his wounds and died on 10 May 1917. =Peter Johnstone= Peter Johnstone was the only contracted Celtic player to give his life in the war ‚Äì a pre-war club legend who had played for Celtic 223 times and won the league four times under manager Willie Maley. Peter joined the 6th Battalion of the Seaforth Highlanders. He died in May 1917, when his regiment were told to capture a chemical factory as part of the Battle of Arras. In the second day of the battle it was reported 43 died, 26 missing and 51 wounded; although he among the missing, rumours of his death spread around Glasgow and were confirmed on 6 June 1917. His name is engraved on the Arras Memorial. =Archie McMillan= Archie McMillan was an outside left who failed to make a competitive appearance for Celtic. He held the rank of Private and was in the 1st/7th Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders. From 21 to 23 November 1917, his regiment was involved in heavy fighting in the Battle of Cambrai. Their orders were to capture the village of Fontaine-Notre-Dame, Aisne and although they were successful he was shot dead and was among the 9 dead, 22 missing and 128 wounded. He is buried in a British war cemetery in Manancourt. =Donald McLeod= Donald \\"Donnie\\" McLeod was a full back who played 155 times for Celtic between 1902 and 1908. He subsequently moved to Middlesbrough and was playing for them when he joined the army. He was a gunner in the 466th Battery of the 65th Royal Field Artillery. It is known that he died of his injuries on 6 October 1917 the cause of them is unknown. However it is most certain that he died in Belgium and was involved (or died) in the Battle of Passchendaele. McLeod is buried in Dozingham Military Cemetery, Westvleteren, Belgium, Plot 5, Row G, Grave 7. =Bob Craig= Bob Craig left Celtic in 1909, having spent three seasons at the club and was the final former Celtic player to die in the war. He was a full-back and played 13 times for the club. He was a private in the 5th Battalion of the South Wales Borderers and died on 19 April 1918. He died of his wounds from 11/04/1918 when the enemy re-captured the town of Mesen in Belgium. He is buried in Boulogne Eastern Cemetery, plot 9, row A, grave 3. William Angus VC In 1914 William Angus was captain of Wishaw Thistle. Details of his time at Celtic remain uncertain, but he was contracted to the club for a short spell before the war, making a couple of appearances for the reserve team. He left the club at some point in season 1913/14 and returned to his primary occupation as a miner in Carluke. He was also a Territorial soldier in the local battalion of the Highland Light Infantry. In 1914 his unit was mobilized and his entire company was sent as a reinforcement draft to the 8th Royal Scots. He crossed to France later that year and in June 1915, near Givenchy, he was awarded the Victoria Cross for bravery and valour in rescuing Lt James Martin who had fallen wounded a few feet from the German line. Angus was wounded 40 times in the process and lost an eye. When he came home to Scotland he was given a hero's welcome and was always a guest of honour in major football matches. He also became the president of Carluke Rovers F.C. and held that position until his death. Charity Despite not being actively involved in the conflict, the people at home made valuable contributions to the war effort. In 1918 Celtic won the Navy and Army War Fund Shield, a friendly tournament that Celtic and a few other teams agreed to take part as a fundraising event to give money to footballers and their families who fought in the war.

The marine department was one of the firm‚Äôs largest in terms of numbers. While shipping and trade represented two of its mainstay practices, the firm cast a wide net and also serves clients in energy and offshore, insurance, business and finance, commercial disputes and aviation. Ince Gordon Dadds provides advice to a wide range of businesses, ranging from international corporations to smaller companies, sole traders and individuals.

In keeping with the progressive ethos of the ‚Äò60s, the firm opened its doors to foreign lawyers for the first time. Structure Ince Gordon Dadds‚Äô structure is a little different from its peers‚Äô with the firm divided by sectors rather than splitting the lawyers into practice areas. In practice, this means any lawyer can be called upon to serve in any area. Ince Gordon Dadds‚Äô shipping practice handles every aspect of maritime law, including collisions, salvage, charter party, carriage of goods, ship finance, work-out, pollution and most prominently in recent years piracy acting on some of the high-profile piracy cases in Somalia, the Niger Delta and the Malacca Straits.

VI 1964 180a-182b He was a nephew of Pope Urban VIII and brother of Cardinals Francesco Barberini and Antonio Barberini. Thanks to their uncle's famous nepotism, the brothers shaped 17th-century Italian politics, religion, art, music and architecture.  Biography  Barberini was born in 1603, the son of Carlo Barberini and Costanza Magalotti. He was the nephew of brothers cardinal Maffeo Barberini (later Pope Urban VIII) and Antonio Marcello Barberini (later also Cardinal) and of Lorenzo Magalotti. He was the brother of Francesco Barberini and Antonio Barberini,Worldroots - Barberini both of whom became Cardinals when their uncle became pope. Like his brothers, Taddeo was educated at the Collegio Romano.Power And Religion in Baroque Rome: Barberini Cultural Policies by P. J. A. N. Rietbergen (Brill, 2006) = Pontificate of Pope Urban VIII = In 1623, Maffeo Barberini was elected as Pope Urban VIII and Taddeo Barberini's fortunes improved considerably. Almost immediately, Barberini was appointed Gonfalonier of the Church; Commander of the Papal Army, though during later conflicts his brother Cardinal Antonio Barberini also commanded papal and mercenary troops in the field. In 1624, Taddeo took control of the Duchy of Urbino, relinquished to Urban VIII after the death of Federico Ubaldo. When Francesco Maria died in 1631, the duchy was transferred to the Papal States. History of the popes; their church and state (Volume III) by Leopold von Ranke (Wellesley College Library, reprint; 2009) On 14 October 1627 Barberini married Anna Colonna, daughter of Filippo I Colonna, at a lavish service presided over by the pope himself at the Castel Gandolfo. The agreement drawn up by Cardinal Fabrizio Verospi between the Barberini and Colonnas stipulated a dowry worth some 180,000 scudi which included cash and credit as well as a Colonna castle in Anticoli.Marriage in Italy, 1300-1650 by Trevor Dean & K.J.P. Lowe (Cambridge University Press, 2002) It is thought the transfer of the Palestrina comune between the two families was tied to the agreement; part of Anna Colonna's dowry. Upon transfer, the commune became a fief of the Barberini which allowed the family to appoint one of its number as Prince of Palestrina, a title which was passed from one Barberini patriarch to another while the comune remained among family possessions. Taddeo's son Carlo Barberini later renounced his right to inherit his father's titles (as he would have done as eldest son) to become a cardinal. Taddeo's hereditary titles therefore passed to his second son, Maffeo. As Prince of Palestrina, Taddeo worked to improve local buildings and establish new services, even if many of them were primarily self-serving. He rebuilt the Palazzo Barberini (which still houses the Nile mosaic of Palestrina) and his son Maffeo later commissioned a new church nearby. Taddeo built a small private casino which operated for a few years during his administration but closed when future princes had no interest in gambling.Palestrina by Roberto Piperno (last revised: May 2012) Investiture of Taddeo Barberini as Prefect by Pope Urban Pope Urban further honoured his nephew in 1631 by appointing him Governor of the Borgo, Commander of Sant'Angelo and Prefect of Rome. Taddeo's investiture as prefect was celebrated with much pomp and extravagance. It is estimated that by 1632, Taddeo's property was worth as much as 4 million scudi and that over the course of Urban VIII's 21-year reign, Taddeo amassed 42 million scudi in personal wealth.Papal Genealogy: The Families And Descendants Of The Popes by George L. Williams (McFarland, 2004) By 1635, income from Taddeo's property was estimated at 100,000 scudi per year. = First War of Castro = In 1639, Odoardo Farnese, Duke of Parma and Piacenza, came to Rome and during his visit managed to insult Taddeo's cardinal brothers. Pope Urban responded by banning grain shipments from Farnese controlled areas. When the Farnese were then unable to pay their debts the Pope sent debt collectors.The Duchy of Castro by Roberto Piperno (last revised: May 2012) Finally the Pope troops to occupy Castro. The Pope's forces were led by Antonio Barberini, his mercenary field commander Luigi Mattei and by Fabrizio Savelli. When Savelli proved to be an unenthusiastic commander, he was returned to Rome and Taddeo Barberini was appointed in his place.Pope Alexander the Seventh and the College of Cardinals by John Bargrave, edited by James Craigie Robertson (reprint; 2009) Castro fell without significant resistance and the victory was celebrated in song by Barberini family composer, Marco Marazzoli. But the victory was short lived and thereafter papal troops suffered a series of decisive losses. Pope Urban was forced to accept defeat and signed a peace treaty with the Farnese Dukes in an attempt to prevent them from marching on Rome itself. = Exile and death = In 1644, Taddeo's uncle Pope Urban VIII died and the College of Cardinals elected Pope Innocent X of the Pamphili family. At the Papal conclave of 1644, Taddeo's cardinal brothers engineered a deal to ensure the safety of their family's fortunes. But the new Pope refused to honour the deal and launched an investigation into alleged financial abuses during the First War of Castro. Taddeo Barberini and his brothers were forced into exile and fled to Paris in 1646 where they were supported by Cardinal Jules Mazarin. Taddeo's wife Anna Colonna appealed to Pope Innocent urging him to allow the Barberini to keep their property. Innocent agreed but the Barberini remained in exile for several more years. Taddeo Barberini died in 1647 while in exile in France without ever seeing Rome again.  Issue  Camilla Barberini as a child, shortly before her death; painted by Tiberio Tito. Taddeo and Anna Colonna had five children: *Lucrezia Barberini (1628‚Äì1699) who married Francesco I d'Este, Duke of Modena *Camilla Barberini (1629‚Äì1631) who died in infancy *Carlo Barberini (1630‚Äì1704) who became a Cardinal *Maffeo Barberini who became Prince of Palestrina *Niccol√≤ Maria Barberini (1635‚Äì1699) Legacy The Barberini family was reconciled with the papacy, at least in part, through Taddeo's two sons, Carlo Barberini and Maffeo Barberini. Carlo was elevated to cardinal by Pope Innocent X and Maffeo married a grand-niece of Pope Innocent X, Olimpia Giustiniani, and in turn had a son who was elevated to cardinal, Francesco Barberini (Junior). Taddeo's daughter, Lucrezia Barberini, married Francesco I d'Este, Duke of Modena. Barberini's secretary, Corinzio Benicampi, accompanied the young Carlo Maratta to Rome in 1636.Giovan Pietro Bellori: The Lives of the Modern Painters, Sculptors and Architects: A New Translation and Critical Edition translations and additions by Hellmut Wohl (Cambridge University Press, 2005).

Established in 1737, the law faculty belongs to one of the four founding faculties of the university. It offers the Dipl.-Jur., LL.M. and Dr. jur. degrees in law. It also hosts visiting scholars and several legal research centers. Among other luminaries, the leading German legal scholar Rudolf von Jhering taught here in the late 19th century. Otto von Bismarck, \\"Iron Chancellor\\" of the second German Empire once studied law here in G√∂ttingen. The former German President Richard von Weizs√§cker obtained his Dr.iur. at G√∂ttingen in 1955. Chancellor Gerhard Schr√∂der studied there later in the century and became a lawyer thereafter.  History  Throughout the 18th century the University of G√∂ttingen was at the top of German universities for its extremely free spirit and atmosphere of scientific exploration and research. Napoleon had even studied law here and remarked that \\"G√∂ttingen belongs to the whole Europe\\". Gerlach von M√ºnchhausen, the founder of the faculty in 1737 In the first years of the University of G√∂ttingen it became famous for its faculty of law. In the 18th century Johann Stephan P√ºtter, the most prestigious scholar of public law at that time, taught jus publicum here for half a century, which had attracted a great number of students such as Klemens von Metternich, later diplomat and prime minister of Austria, and Wilhelm von Humboldt, who later set up the University of Berlin. By 1837, when the university was a hundred years old, the University of G√∂ttingen had earned its fame as \\"university of law\\" because almost every year the students enrolled by the faculty of law made up more than half of all the students on the campus.http://www.uni- goettingen.de/de/52148.html G√∂ttingen became a mecca for the study of public law in Germany. Heinrich Heine, the famous German poet, studied law and was awarded Dr.iur.. Rudolf von Jhering, the leading German jurist in the 19th century However, political disturbances, in which both professors and students were implicated, lowered the attendance to 860 in 1834. The expulsion in 1837 of the famous seven professors ‚Äì Die G√∂ttingen Seven for protesting against the revocation by King Ernest Augustus of Hanover of the liberal constitution of 1833, further reduced the prosperity of the university. Thereafter, Gustav Hugo, forerunner of the historical school of law, and Rudolf von Jhering, a most significant jurist who created the theory of \\"culpa in contraendo\\" and wrote Battle for Right, taught here in the 19th century and maintained the good reputation of the faculty of law. Otto von Bismarck, the main creator and first chancellor of the second German Empire, had also studied law in G√∂ttingen in 1833 and lived in a tiny house on the \\"Wall\\" (according to oral tradition, he lived there because his rowdiness had caused him to be banned from living within the city walls), now known as \\"Bismarck Cottage\\".

Co- cathedral of the Diocese of Sofia and Plovdiv together with the Cathedral of St Joseph in Sofia, it is one of the largest and most important Roman Catholic places of worship in the country. It was named after Louis IX of France, commonly known as \\"Saint Louis\\". The cathedral was constructed in the 1850s, during the time of vicar Andrea Canova. The first organ in Bulgaria was installed in the cathedral in 1861, later replaced with a newer and larger one. A fire severely damaged the cathedral in 1931 and destroyed the wood- carved ceiling. The cathedral was reconstructed, with Krastyo Stamatov creating the frescoes and Kamen Petkov being the main architect. The cathedral was once again inaugurated on 8 May 1932. Architecturally, it features an eclectic combination of Neoclassicism and Neo-Baroque. The belfry was built in 1898 and was equipped with five bells cast in the German city of Bochum, a gift from Pope Leo XIII. A new 12-stop pipe organ was installed in 1991. Princess Marie Louise of Bourbon-Parma, first wife of Ferdinand I of Bulgaria, is buried inside the Cathedral, at the far end, to the right of the altar.

The corporation was the result of a merger in 2000 between Calsonic Corp., which specialized in air conditioners and heat exchangers, and gauge maker Kansei Corp.. Nissan increased its shareholding in the company from 27.6 percent to 41.7 percent in January 2005. In November 2016, Nissan confirmed plans to sell its stake to U.S. private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, who later obtained the rest of the company as well in February 2017. In early 2019, Calsonic Kansei was merged with auto-parts maker Magneti Marelli, which was purchased for 6.2 billion euros from Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, by its parent and 100% owning fund, KKR. History On August 25, 1938, Calsonic Corp. was founded as Nihon Radiator Manufacturing Company, Ltd., with radiators as its product line. Nagao Gentaro was its first president. In 1952, the company was renamed more simply as Nihon Radiator Company. Nissan Motor would purchase 60% of the company's share in April 1954 for the purpose of securing the supply of radiators. That same year, Nihon Radiator began producing mufflers, and a year later it began producing car heaters. The name \\"Calsonic\\" was first used in 1976 to refer to Nihon Radiator's first overseas manufacturing plant in California within the United States, combining the state's name with the word \\"sonic\\" from sonic speed to denote the company's dream of expansion. By 1988, Nihon Radiator changed its name to Calsonic Corporation in celebration of its 50th anniversary. Kansei Corp. was established on October 25, 1956 as Kanto Seiki Company, Ltd., spinning off of Nissan Motor with instrument clusters as its main product. In 1960, the company headquarters and manufacturing plant would be relocated from Akabane, Kita, Tokyo Metropolis to ≈åmiya City, Saitama Prefecture (now Saitama City. On April 1, 2000, Calsonic and Kansei were merged to form Calsonic Kansei. Nissan increased its shareholding in the company from 27.6 percent to 41.7 percent in January 2005. On November 22, 2016, American investment firm KKR & Co. announced that it will purchase Calsonic Kansei for $4.5 billion, succeeding over rival private investment firms Bain Capital and MBK Partners. KKR stated that its intention in buying Calsonic Kansei would be to help its international expansion while the company's local Japanese market is shrinking. By March 23, 2017, KKR officially completed the tender offer for Calsonic Kansei. On October 22, 2018, Calsonic Kansei announced that it would be merged with components manufacturer Magneti Marelli from Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA), acquired by the parent fund KKR for $7.1 billion (‚Ç¨6.2 billion). The news was mostly wrongly reported by the press as Calsonic Kansei purchasing Magneti Marelli, while the transaction happened between KKR and FCA. The company's previous bid of nearly $5.9 billion was deemed too low by FCA. By May 2019, Calsonic Kansei and Magneti Marelli united under one brand name, Marelli, as part of its strategy to compete on a global scale.

In the early 1970s, BR allowed steam back on the main line, using preserved steam locomotives, and in 1978 it ran a series of trains during the summer months on a circular route from via and . In 1981, the route was extended to after a turntable was reinstated and named the Scarborough Spa Express. These ran until 1988, but ceased when the staff at York who were responsible were reassigned to separate divisions at InterCity and Regional Railways.The rise and fall of the Scarborough Spa Express The Railway Magazine issue 1065 January 1990 pages 34-37 In the 2000s After 1988, there were occasional steam railtours to Scarborough, featuring locomotives which included 60800 Green Arrow, 46229 Duchess of Hamilton, 48151 Gauge O' Guild, 3440 City of Truro and 45596 Bahamas. It was not until 2002 that regular trips began again. These were introduced by West Coast Railways and ran from Scarborough to York and return for three days a week during July and August. The same format was used again in 2003. The National Railway Museum (NRM) began running a service directly from York to Scarborough in 2004. 4472 Flying Scotsman, having just been acquired by the NRM, was the main locomotive used, but 45407 The Lancashire Fusilier was available in the event of any failure. 5972 Olton Hall also stood in on at least one occasion, still wearing its Hogwarts Expres livery. The NRM sponsored the SSE until the end of 2006, when they decided to hand over the running of the SSE to the Railway Touring Company. In 2007, the Railway Touring Company included the Harrogate loop in the SSE itinerary once more and ran a number of very successful tours during July and August. In 2008-2009, WCR took over the running of the SSE and they again utilised the Harrogate loop, running on three days a week during July and August. In 2010, the route was changed when gauging problems on the Harrogate loop put a stop to any steam locomotive using that route. This is how the Wakefield Circle was born, with WCR again running the SSE three days a week during July and August. The route was York----- and back to York; then, from York the usual trip to Scarborough and back to York and the Wakefield Circle as per the morning run, and finally returning to York at 21-00. It was intended that the same route would be used in 2012. As at 2019, it operates on selected Thursdays during the summer, being hauled by a WCR diesel from to York where a steam locomotive takes over for the journey to Scarborough.Choice of two journeys West Coast Railways Locomotives The following locomotives have been used: *4472 Flying Scotsman *60009 Union of South Africa *6233 Duchess of Sutherland *45231 The Sherwood Forester *45407 The Lancashire Fusilier *34067 Tangmere *5690 Leander *48151 Gauge O Guild *70013 Oliver Cromwell *45699 Galatea *35018 British India Line On 31 July 2007, 6233 Duchess of Sutherland made its first run of the summer but hit a bridge on the approach to Harrogate, this caused minor damage to the drivers side of the firebox.

History  Pennington was founded by Jose Martin Predo, AF Westall, and Daniel Dailey in 1835 on a land grant By 1859, Dailey was the sole owner of the land grant. In 1866, Dailey began to plot out the land grant, what is today Pennington, then solely in Trinity County, named after Hill Pennington, the town's first merchant. The post office opened in 1883. The peak of the town was around this time as it was the county seat, with a population of over 1500. However, the seat was moved to nearby Groveton, along with the fact that Pennington had no railroad, which lead to the decline in 1882. Pennington was briefly an incorporated town in 1901, but unincorporated in 1904. From then to now, Pennington became a quiet farm town, although, unlike most rural towns that decline, Pennington still has a post office. By the 1990s a small portion of Pennington extended to Houston County. The population is 67 as of 2000.

Inclusion policy  Within the scheme, a young and gifted individual is defined as: \\"...children and young people with one or more abilities developed to a level significantly ahead of their year group (or with the potential to develop those abilities)‚Äù. Entrance to the scheme is via a validation process performed by the student's school or college and is based on criteria including: * For students aged between 4‚Äì11, there is no set percentage and they are identified by their performance and ability relative to their cohort. * For students aged between 11‚Äì19, that they fall within the top 5% of students as identified by the national eligibility criteria provided by The Department for Children, Schools and Families (DCSF). Alternatively they can be selected by the use of local sectional that identifies them as above average in their cohort within their school age group. While the onus is on schools to determine the size of their gifted and talented population, clear justification for the size of the group and the benefit to all members must be clearly identified. The DCSF uses 10% of any given school population as the assumption of size during the planning process.  Operations  The operations of the programme are outsourced to the CfBT Education Trust who took over the National Programme for Gifted and Talented Education in September 2007 and renamed it to the Young, Gifted & Talented.

PASSOP believes in and advocates for equality and justice for people across all societies, irrespective of nationality, age, gender, race, creed, disability or sexual orientation. PASSOP creates and strengthens networks of communication, dialogue and interchange for the advancement of peace, understanding and justice in local communities and it is within these local communities where most of their membership resides.http://www.iol.co.za/index.php? Their mission is to empower communities to stand up and express their beliefs, needs and fears freely and access the rights to which they are entitled. PASSOP believes that this can be achieved through basic rights education, activism, integration and community participation.set_id=1&click;_id=3069&art;_id=vn20080710054824971C327450 PASSOP has expanded greatly in the last couple of years and now offers a range of services including: anti-xenophobia help desks that offer paralegal advice, integration events and workshops, a Disabled Children Support Project, an African Solidarity Education Project, assistance with documentation issues, ZDP Permits and Appeals, monitoring of Internally Displaced Persons camps and other advocacy and education projects.  Founding  PASSOP was founded in 2007 by a group of Zimbabweans and spearheaded by Braam Hanekom. Though originally established in response to increased tensions between Zimbabwean foreign nationals fleeing Robert Mugabe's increasingly repressive regime and South African citizens who blamed them for crime and unemployment.http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&click;_id=3069&art;_id=vn20080624054258675C196798 PASSOP has since become a leading advocatehttp://www.iol.co.za/index.php?art_id=vn20080120093614303C253588 for refugees and immigrants to demand human rights in South Africa. Staffed by volunteers and funded primarily through donations, PASSOP has had a large impact on the debate around the situation of documented and undocumented immigrants in South Africa, vowing to be a ‚Äúvoice for the voiceless.‚Äù. Passop is an Afrikaans word meaning beware. PASSOP is unique amongst other South African non-profit organisations in that it is an advocacy and activist organisation that draws the majority of its members and volunteers from the refugee community.  History  By identifying and exposing corruption within the Home Affairs Department's Refugee Reception Centre, PASSOP has helped to increase the number of asylum seekers being served each day (from around 20 before the creation of PASSOP to now over 200). Through protest action, PASSOP has brought the issues of corruption and xenophobia to the public eye.http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&click;_id=3045&art;_id=vn20080414153304876C257855http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&click;_id=3045&art;_id=vn20071205112720435C110949 In November 2007, PASSOP set the tone for its protest activism in its advocacy for the refugees who were forced to wait in massive queues outside of Cape Town's Department of Home Affairs Refugee Center. At that time, the Department of Home Affairs processed only 20 asylum applications daily, while 600 to 2,000 refugees camped outside the department in a queue circling the block.http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&click;_id=3045&art;_id=vn20080227114154122C478756 Many foreign nationals waited in the queue for weeks; one, Adonis Musati, starved to death while waiting to receive asylum documents that he was entitled to by law.BBC News http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7090730.stm Zimbabwean Dies Queuing for Visa\\" Following this death, PASSOP lodged a complaint with the South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) and raised funds to repatriate Musati's body to Zimbabwe. PASSOP members also staged several protests at the Refugee Center and lobbied the Parliament on behalf of those refugees still waiting in the queue.http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&click;_id=3045&art;_id=vn20071115113932766C208216 As a direct result, Cape Town's Department of Home Affairs now services between 180 and 300 applications daily.  Xenophobia and PASSOP  There are a large number of immigrants living in South Africa, estimates varying between one and three million. Massive documentation backlogs, poor queue management, corruption, and a general lack of resources at the Refugee Reception Centres across South Africa, coupled with an incoherent immigration policy in general has led to a situation in which most of immigrants in South Africa are undocumented. It is these undocumented immigrants, asylum seekers and refugees that are the most vulnerable, most marginalised section of South Africa's population. This group of undocumented immigrants is acutely under-represented in labour unions, civil society and community activism efforts, and not represented at all politically. This lack of representation leaves them with compromised access to education, health care, labour rights, shelter, and even the most basic human rights. They are among the most easily and widely exploited individuals in South Africa, and are often made the victims of targeted hate crimes and xenophobic aggression. In 2008, more than 60 immigrants were killed and over 30,000 people were forcefully displaced as a result of xenophobic attacks throughout South Africa. In 2009, the attacks were repeated and over 3,000 people were displaced in the Western Cape alone. PASSOP fights for the rights of this acutely marginalised group of people. For example, following xenophobic attacks in several informal settlements in the Western Cape and Gautang in May and June 2008, PASSOP was a vocal member of the Civil Society Task Team, set up by the SAHRC in response to the massive influx of foreign nationals into refugee camps. PASSOP worked closely with both South Africans and foreign nationals to negotiate the refugees' peaceful reintegration into their communities.http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&click;_id=3045&art;_id=vn20080425113642333C725509 PASSOP remains a forum in which refugees can speak out about the conditions in which they now live in South Africa. PASSOP works closely with community leaders in the Zimbabwean, Congolese and Somali community structures to address issues, concerns and problems facing refugees and immigrants within Cape Town. In this, PASSOP especially advocates for undocumented immigrants who often have no civil representation. PASSOP collaborates with students and has many student volunteers from the University of Cape Town who assist and support it in many of its day-to-day functions. Moreover, PASSOP is the beneficiary of the annual Cape Town Zimfest Music festival, first held in the Good Hope centre, Cape Town on 6 September 2008. The musical event features performers including Freshlyground, The Rudimentals, The Dirty Skirts, Ike Moriz, New Altum, Tristan Waterkeyn and Coda.  Core values  PASSOP believes that South Africans and African Immigrants have in common the dreams shared by many oppressed ‚Äì those of freedom, of peace, of freedom of expression and most importantly those of equality. PASSOP maintains that definitions of refugees and asylum seekers need to be reformulated to take into account breadline refugees. The situation in Zimbabwe is so appalling that people must choose between leaving their homes in search of a means of survival or remaining at home to starve. The economic condition in Zimbabwe is so extreme it constitutes a humanitarian crisis. People in Zimbabwe are so destitute that many are below the breadline, meaning they cannot even afford basic food and are therefore driven out of their own country, seeking subsistence survival in South Africa and other Southern African nations. PASSOP wants to make the South African public aware of the lack of choice people have in their decisions to cross the border.http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&click;_id=3069&art;_id=nw20080516180251853C534717 PASSOP is against all xenophobic attacks on immigrants and maintains that the right to freedom and dignity is one of all persons residing in South Africa, whether here legally or illegally. PASSOP has made their disappointment with South African foreign policy known through the media and public protests. PASSOP continues to demand immediate improvement in the services provided to refugees and asylum seekers by the Department of Home Affairs. PASSOP's dream is to be more than just an organisation. They hope to become a community-based human rights movement; a congregation of informed and empowered members that adhere to the same set of values and guiding principles and are actively engaged in their communities to influence positive change. The change they are working towards is fourfold: :1. A better realisation of people‚Äôs rights; :2. Greater integration between South Africans and foreign nationals; :3. A more progressive and welcoming immigration policy; and :4. More equality between the powerful and the marginalised.

The combine cycle section was inaugurated in 2003, and the solar field on 14 July 2010. The solar field is the first to use molten salt for heat transfer and storage which is integrated with the combined-cycle gas facility. It uses technology developed by ENEA and Archimede Solar Energy, a joint venture between Angelantoni Industrie and Siemens Energy. Archimede is owned and operated by Enel. The plant is called \\"Archimedes\\" (the famous resident of the nearby Magna Graecia Hellenistic city of Syracuse) after the rows of huge parabolic mirrors used to capture the sun's rays, which recall the \\"burning mirrors\\" that Archimedes is said to have used to set fire to the Roman ships besieging Syracuse during the Siege of Syracuse (214‚Äì212 BC). The existing gas-fired power plant is on about a site area (excluding the solar field), and is augmented by the Archimede solar field.  Description = Combined cycle section = There are two Siemens V94 3/A gas turbine groups with 257 MWe net alternator each. The gas turbine discharge, outgoing , produce steam, through a so-called HRSG (Heat recovery steam generator) which then feeds a steam turbine group (with high, medium and low pressure turbines) driving a 122 MWe net alternator. The solar component integrates the steam production of the gas turbines through a SSG (Solar Steam Generator), up to a maximum of 15 MWth (thermal net power), in conditions of maximum insolation. The HSRG-1 and HSRG-2 operate in parallel with the SSG, shortly before entering steam turbine group. This means that every unit of thermal energy coming from the solar field delivers electricity only in accordance with the coefficient of efficiency of the steam section, not being involved in the gas turbines. The overall efficiency of the combined cycle turns out to be 56%, much less the steam section alone. = Solar field section = left At first, the solar field was planned larger but in the end it consists of a field of about of mirrors (the parabolic collectors) that concentrate sunlight onto of pipe carrying the molten salt fluid. Molten salt is used as the heat transfer fluid in solar field and is heated to . The thermal energy is then stored in a hot tank and is used to produce high pressure steam to run steam turbines for electricity generation, reducing the consumption of fossil fuels and, as a result, enhancing the environmental performance of the combined-cycle plant. The solar collectors (the parabolic mirrors and pipes or receivers), together with a steam generator and two heat storage tanks ‚Äì one cold and one hot ‚Äì make up the solar portion of the system. When the sun shines, the thermal fluid drawn from the cold tank is circulated through the network of parabolic collectors, where it is heated to a temperature of and injected into the hot tank, where the thermal energy is stored. The fluid is then drawn from the hot reservoir to produce steam at high pressure and temperature, which is sent to Enel's nearby combined-cycle plant, where it contributes to electricity generation. This system enables the solar field to generate steam at any time of the day and in all weather conditions until the stored thermal energy is depleted. Steam from the solar field may be used to heat the steam turbine group before start-up, or to keep it warm for a faster start-up and less mechanical stress. The addition of the solar plant to the power station should reduce the amount of gas burnt at the plant and cut carbon dioxide emissions by 7,300 tonnes. The solar field is relatively small, being less than half of the area dedicated solely to the conventional power plant section.

His pseudonym was Jenneval, possibly named after the drama Jenneval, ou le Barnevelt fran√ßais (1769) of Louis S√©bastien Mercier. Dechet worked in Ajaccio, Marseille and in 1826 at the Paris Od√©on.

In 1828 he returned to Paris in order to work at the Com√©die Fran√ßaise, but returned to Brussels immediately after the July Revolution in 1830. He there served with the city guard which was responsible for maintaining law and order. Dechet is said to have written the text of the Braban√ßonne during the first revolutionary gatherings at the caf√© \\"L'Aigle d'Or\\" in the Brussels Greepstraat in August 1830, shortly after the performance of the opera La Muette de Portici, which triggered the Belgian revolution.

Although mainly producing functional items, he also earned a reputation for ornamental wares. In 1885 he exhibited a range of his products at the New Zealand Industrial Exhibition in Wellington, New Zealand. The judges commended Boyd's 'most attractive show of pottery' saying his work proved there could be 'a real art-feeling in the manufacture of cheap and common goods'. Following the exhibition, he gave a selection of his 'artistic wares' to the Colonial Museum, a predecessor of the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa. When he died in 1886, his will ordered the executors to close down the Newton Pottery, sell the machinery, and destroy the moulds. Examples of his work are now rare and highly sought after.
