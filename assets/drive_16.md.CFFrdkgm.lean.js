It is a member of the Hamilton-Wentworth District School Board. The school's mission statement is \\"Educating students to become lifelong learners and contributing citizens in a challenging, changing, multi- cultural world.\\" Apart from the standard course offerings, the school provides special education classes and an ESL program. History Sir Winston Churchill Secondary School was founded in 1967 as part of a plan by the Board of Education for the City of Hamilton to have enough schools available to meet the demand of the baby boomers. In 1972, the school became Hamilton's pilot school in the semester system style of schedule that had been showing positive increases in student achievement amongst schools in Alberta and British Columbia. The school was named after Sir Winston Churchill, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom during World War II. The school gained notoriety in the fall of 1987, as it became one of a handful of schools suggested for transfer to the Hamilton Wentworth District Separate School Board. Under a controversial law, which extended public funding to the Catholic school system in Ontario, arbitration suggested that the Winona Secondary School and Churchill be transferred to the Catholic school board, as a measure to address overcrowding among their secondary schools. The protests led to a demonstration at Queen's Park, where groups of secondary school students from the Hamilton and surrounding area, all converged in front of the Ontario Legislature building. Despite the protests, the province accepted the findings of the arbitration. Over the summer of 1988, negotiations between the School Board for the City of Hamilton and the Hamilton Wentworth District Separate School Board resulted in the transfer of Elizabeth Bagshaw School to become the new home of Bishop Ryan Catholic Secondary School, until the 2014 opening of their new building on Rymal Road at Upper Mount Albion Road.

Incidents =2019 stabbing death of Grade 9 student= On October 7, 2019, 14-year-old Grade 9 student Devan Bracci-Selvey was stabbed to death in front of his mother outside Sir Winston Churchill Secondary School by four fellow students. Bracci-Selvey's mother had driven to the school to pick up her son around 1:30PM after he called to say other students at the school had been bothering him. She arrived and saw a group of students taunting Bracci-Selvey and spraying him with an unknown substance, thought to be bear mace. The group hunted the boy down a sidewalk as he fled with his mother following in her vehicle. A 16 year-old girl repeatedly taunted Bracci-Selvey demanding he hit her, to which he replied, \\"I can‚Äôt hit you, I wasn‚Äôt raised that way.\\" These were the last words his mother would hear from her son alive. Bracci-Selvey attempted to rush over to enter his mother's vehicle but was swarmed and stabbed. A group of student bystanders witnessed the entire incident, recording the murder live on their cell phones, which police later sought to have turned over as evidence and not shared on social media. The slain student's sister wrote on a GoFundMe fundraiser for Devan's funeral that her brother was a \\"shy, quiet, [helpful] kid who had tried get help with the bullying he was experiencing.\\" Bracci-Selvey was fond of cars, video games, and animals, had dreams of becoming a mechanic, and was excited to become an uncle for the second time. Bracci-Selvey, as per his mother, ‚Äúprotected everybody‚Äù and never hesitated to stick up for friends when they were being harassed. Citing the age of the victim and suspects as well as an ongoing investigation, police would not comment on nor confirm speculation and reports surrounding possible motives and the nature of the confirmed \\"existing relationship\\" between the victim and the accused. Relatives, including the boy's mother, who spoke to Global News and CP24, confirmed Bracci-Selvey was relentlessly bullied since beginning high school a month earlier and their concerns were dismissed by school officials who deemed there was \\"insufficient evidence to take action.\\" Bracci-Selvey had begun skipping classes, attending school part-time before calling asking to be picked up, or refusing to go to school in the mornings as a result of the bullying. Two brothers, a 14-year- old and an 18-year-old, were arrested after the incident and later charged with first-degree murder following a preliminary investigation by Hamilton Police Service. A third individual was arrested but ‚Äúwas interviewed and later released unconditionally once [their] involvement in the investigation was established.‚Äù On October 8, 2019, police had announced a 16-year-old male and a 16-year-old female, outstanding suspects, were also arrested and taken into custody on suspicion of first-degree murder. On October 9, 2019, both were released without charge after being questioned lengthily about the homicide. Detective-Sergeant Steve Bereziuk noted in a media release that \\"based on evidence there is some element of pre-planning [‚Ä¶] and premeditation [involved with] this homicide.\\" A crisis response intervention team, social workers, police liaison officers, wellness counsellors, and extra staff support for teachers and administrators were sent to the school following the incident. As public frustration and anger grew against the perceived inaction of the Hamilton-Wentworth District School Board (HWDSB) leading up to the incident, Director of Education Manny Figueiredo advised CBC News that \\"an investigation into what happened [would] get underway once the police investigation wraps [up].\\" After the stabbing, Figueiredo felt the school was still \\"the safest place for a kid to be right now [as] a lot of [students] want to be together, they want to be with their friends and talk and make sense and deal with their grief\\" even as many parents kept their children home from school in the days after the stabbing. When pressed specifically on the bullying Bracci-Selvey endured and what the school did in response, Figueiredo said he was not aware of what led up to the violence and instead advocated for a community-oriented response: \\"The schools don't live in isolation of the community... they need to take a leadership role [when it comes to bullying] because we have these students for five hours a day. We have to continue to engage our kids...if a kid turns to us, how are we responding so they see that it's safe to respond?\\" Figueiredo encouraged students who do not feel safe, or have not felt safe in the past, to raise their concerns with adults.

Readers use seven needles or up to twenty one needles in a somewhat shallow bowl with water in it. Needles may also be dropped onto a flat surface that has been coated with powder or flour. Readers then look for the designs that the needles make in the substance. Some of the main designs are lines. They may be broken, parallel, vertical, or horizontal in some fashion. The broken line may mean traveling or heading on a new journey. The parallel lines may mean money in the future, either given or taken away. The vertical lines are meant as guided roads to take. The horizontal lines may mean what the fate will be. There is another type of acultomancy and that is called acutomancy. This practice uses sharp objects or anything that is pointed. Seven are dropped onto a table and the pattern is distinguished and read. Another practice along with this one is Acutomanzia. Acutomanzia employs thirteen pins. Ten must be straight and three are bent at an angle. They are also dropped into flour or powder of some sort to discern patterns.

He's the author of four books: The Red Market, The Enlightenment Trap, What Doesn't Kill Us and The Wedge. Carney contributes stories on a variety of medical, technological and ethical issues to Wired, Mother Jones, Playboy, Foreign Policy, Men's Journal, and National Public Radio. Carney was the first American journalist to write about dare-devil ice guru Wim Hof in a 2014 article in Playboy. The book that came out of that research,What Doesn't Kill Us spent two months on the New York Times bestseller list in 2017. His 2020 book, The Wedge explores the core concepts of the Wim Hof Method and applies them to a wide array of physical training. Carney is an outspoken advocate of freelance writers and writes frequently on his blog about the struggles that freelance journalists face both in the field and navigating the business side of the profession. He is unusual in that he argues that magazines often have exceptionally high profits, and the low pay and contract terms that writers get are better attributed to exploitative business practices instead of a poor overall market for the written word.http://www.scottcarney.com/2015/01/case-20-per-word/ He founded the website WordRates, which operated from 2015 to 2017, to provide journalists a new way to sell and market their work. He reported from Chennai, India between 2006‚Äì2009. In 2015 he founded the tiny Denver-based media company Foxtopus Ink which produces audio books, video courses and podcasts. In 2018 Foxtopus Ink released the podcast Wild Thing the search for bigfoot. Carney holds a number of academic and professional appointments including as a contributing editor at Wired, a senior fellow at the Schuster Institute for Investigative Journalism at Brandeis University, and as a judge for the Payne Award for Ethics in Journalism. He graduated from Kenyon College in 2000 and dropped out of a PhD in anthropology from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in order to pursue journalism. Works = The Red Market = Carney coined the phrase \\"The Red Market\\" to describe a broad category of economic transactions around the human body. Drawing on the concepts black markets, white markets and gray markets he suggests that commerce in body parts is separate because bodies are not commodities in a strict sense. Instead commerce in human bodies needs to account for the ineffable quality of life and creates a lifelong debt between the provider and receiver of the flesh. Straight commerce in human bodies disguises the supply chain and reduces a human life to its meat value. Carney calls for \\"radical transparency\\" in the red market supply chain in order to protect its humanness. The book, The Red Market traces the rise, fall, and resurgence of this multibillion-dollar underground organ trade through history, from early medical study and modern universities to poverty-ravaged Eurasian villages and high-tech Western labs; from body snatchers and surrogate mothers to skeleton dealers and the poor who sell body parts to survive. While local and international law enforcement have cracked down on the market, advances in science have increased the demand for human tissue‚Äîligaments, kidneys, even rented space in women's wombs‚Äîleaving little room to consider the ethical dilemmas inherent in the flesh-and-blood trade. =The Enlightenment Trap= The Enlightenment Trap examines the unusual circumstances around the death of Ian Thorson while on a meditation retreat in the mountains of Arizona. The book uses Thorson's story as a springboard to understanding the path that Tibetan Buddhism took to get to the United States and analyzes the often conflicted relationship that Americans have with the concept of enlightenment. Carney recounts the story of the death of his former student Emily O'Conner who took her life on a meditation retreat in India in 2006. Thorson was a follower of the controversial Buddhist guru Michael Roach who teaches a version of Buddhism that closely aligns with the Christian Gospel of Prosperity. Carney's book is based in part on his article in Playboy, \\"Death and Madness on Diamond Mountain\\".http://www.scottcarney.com/article/death-and-madness-on-diamond- mountain/ The book was originally published under the title \\"A Death on Diamond Mountain\\", and was re-released in 2016 under a new title. =What Doesn't Kill Us= In 2011 Carney travelled to meet Dutch fitness guru Wim Hof in Poland on an assignment from Playboy with the intention of exposing him as a charlatan. Hof claimed to be able to teach a meditation technique that would allow people to consciously control their body temperature and immune systems. The claims were similar to those made by Michael Roach. After a week studying the method, however, Carney \\"had to reevaluate everything he thought about gurus\\". Within a week he learned how to perform similar feats as Hof, including hiking up a snow covered mountain wearing just a bathing suit. His book, What Doesn't Kill Us, continues the journey by linking evolutionary theory and environmental conditioning with the Wim Hof Method. He interviews US Army scientists who are trying to find ways to make soldiers more effective in extreme environments, the founders of the outdoor workout movement the November Project, legendary surfer Laird Hamilton and endurance runner Brian MacKenzie. Carney ends his journey by climbing up to the top of Mount Kilimanjaro, most of the way, wearing just a bathing suit.  Awards  Carney won the 2010 Payne Award for Ethics in Journalism for his story \\"Meet the Parents\\". In 2008, he was selected as a finalist for the Livingston Award for International Journalism for an article titled \\"The Bone Factory\\",https://web.archive.org/web/20111106115524/http://www.livawards.org/winners/finalists.html he was also a finalist for the same award in 2010 for this story \\"Cash on Delivery\\" about surrogate pregnancies in India. He has been nominated for the Daniel Pearl Award from the South Asian Journalists Association three times. The Red Market won the 2012 Clarion Award for best non-fiction book. WordRates In 2015 Carney launched a Kickstarter campaign to found the website WordRates which he called a \\"sort of Yelp! for journalists\\". The website provided a way for freelance journalists to rate editors and magazines for how easy they are to work with. WordRates also had a dedicated section called \\"PitchLab\\" that pairs up established journalists with other writers in order to sell stories to magazines and newspapers at market rates. The site shut down in August 2017. Foxtopus Ink After closing down WordRates Carney launched the media company Foxtopus Ink with his wife, and former NPR editor, Laura Krantz. The company continued the work of WordRates with video courses and ebooks on the business of writing, while also producing Carney's audiobooks and the podcast Wild Thing--about the search for Sasquatch in North America.

Plot Temple Houston is based loosely on the career of the real-life circuit-riding lawyer Temple Lea Houston (1860‚Äì1905), son of the more famous Sam Houston. Little, however, binds all the episodes together under a common framework. The series variously cast the characters and situations in both an overtly humorous and a deadly serious light. Author-historian (and attorney) Francis M. Nevins asserts of the first episode entitled \\"The Twisted Rope\\", \\"Clearly, the concept here is Perry Mason out West\\", going so far as to note that Temple Houston's court opponent \\"apes Hamilton Burger by accusing Houston of 'prolonging this trial with a lot of dramatic nonsense'\\". Later episodes turned Houston into more of a detective than a lawyer. Over the course of the series, the bulk of the narrative sees Houston actually gathering evidence, rather than trying cases. In the end, the series largely eschewed criminal law in favor of overtly humorous plots, such as in the episode \\"The Law and Big Annie\\", in which Houston uses his legal expertise to help a friend decide what to do after he inherits an elephant. The producers tried to avoid any storylines that would embarrass the two surviving children of Temple Houston who were still living when the series aired.Production memo, Temple Houston files, Warner Bros. Archives, Cinema-Television Library, University of Southern California.

In addition, the Temple Houston pilot episode was unusable for the introduction to the new series because James Coburn, who played the secondary character, a gunslinger turned U.S. marshal, would not accept a role in a series. Coburn's character was hence assumed by Jack Elam as George Taggart. A leading character actor in film and television, Elam had just left the short-lived ABC/Warner Bros. western, The Dakotas, which had replaced Clint Walker's long- running Cheyenne series early in 1963.Billy Hathorn, \\"Roy Bean, Temple Houston, Bill Longley, Ranald Mackenzie, Buffalo Bill, Jr., and the Texas Rangers: Depictions of West Texans in Series Television, 1955 to 1967\\", West Texas Historical Review, Vol. 89 (2013), pp. 106-109 On orders from Jack Webb, episodes were put together in two or three days each, something previously thought impossible in television production. Work began on August 7, 1963, with the initial airing set for September 19. Jimmy Lydon, a former child actor, adult actor, and producer who was at the time with WB, recalled that Webb told the staff: \\"Fellas, I just sold Temple Houston. We gotta be on the air in four weeks, we can't use the pilot, we have no scripts, no nothing - do it!\\" Lydon recalled the team having worked around the clock to get Temple Houston on the air. Co-producer William Conrad directed six episodes, two scripts simultaneously on two different soundstages at WB. \\"We bicycled Jeff (Hunter) and (Jack) Elam between the two companies, and Bill shot 'em both in four-and-a-half days. Two complete one-hour shows!\\" said Lydon. In a 1965 interview, Hunter described the situation: Two Temple Houston directors, Robert Totten and Irving J. Moore, worked on Gunsmoke as well. Character actress Mary Wickes was cast in several episodes as Ida Goff, and Frank Ferguson, formerly Gus the ranch hand on My Friend Flicka, played Judge Gurney. =Pilot= The earliest known conceptual documents for Temple Houston date back to 1957. It took about six years for a pilot to be filmed. That pilot, The Man From Galveston, was filmed in March 1963, but was never broadcast on television. Instead, the 57-minute film was released theatrically late in 1963. The series used a different cast from the movie pilot.Production memo, Temple Houston files, Warner Bros. Archives, Cinema-Television Library, University of Southern California. Jeffrey Hunter was the only cast member to star in both pilot and series, although his character was re-dubbed Timothy Higgins in the pilot when it was released as a theatrical film. The series was produced by Warner Bros. Television and Apollo Productions, a company co-owned by star Jeffrey Hunter, who had demanded to produce it in exchange for a film and television commitment to Warner Bros.Jeffreyhuntermovies.com Glenn A. Mosley, \\"Temple Houston: The Story Behind a Forgotten Western\\". Wildest Westerns Magazine, Issue No. 2, 2000. Under this contract, Hunter appeared in the Warner Bros. 1965 theatrical releases Murieta (1965) and Brainstorm. By December 1963, the series was rated 31st of the 32 new shows that season. NBC then ordered a switch back to more humorous stories. but the change merely allowed the series to continue to the end of the season. =Cancellation= Temple Houston was pulled after one season of twenty-six episodes. Hunter later indicated that he thought the series failed because of an inability to establish a consistent tone. The Hunter and Houston parallel Hunter as Houston The unused pilot with Hunter cast as lawyer Timothy Higgins, was released in theaters in December 1963 as The Man from Galveston. Hopeful of success in the series and being paid $5,000 per episode, Jeffrey Hunter, a native of New Orleans, Louisiana, described the historic figure that he played as \\"one of the finest lawyers in the last part of the 19th century.\\" Indeed, Temple Houston at the age of 20 was the youngest practicing lawyer in Texas. He was the county attorney in Brazoria County south of Houston, until he accepted appointment as the district attorney of the 35th Judicial District, which then encompassed 26 counties in the Texas Panhandle, based in the frontier community of Mobeetie in Wheeler County. As a member of the Texas State Senate from 1885 to 1889, Temple Houston became involved with a dispute with the legendary cattleman and rancher Charles Goodnight, sometimes called \\"the father of the Texas Panhandle\\". At issue was fencing of grasslands to accommodate large ranchers. Houston sided unsuccessfully with the smaller ranchers who wanted free grassland. One historian described the real Temple Houston as \\"a flamboyant figure in his black frock coat and shoulder-length auburn hair topped off with a white Stetson. He liked to lace his arguments with literary allusions and could enthrall a courtroom or legislative chamber.\\" Houston gave the dedication in 1888 for the new state capitol building in Austin, Texas. He subsequently worked for Oklahoma statehood, which came to fruition two years after his death. Houston lost races for Texas attorney general and territorial governor of Oklahoma. In the series, Houston located his clients by traveling with the circuit court and being available as needed. Jeffrey Hunter described the Temple Houston that he sought to emulate as having \\"many sides to his character. He was a flamboyant orator; he was a bit of a dandy; he was tough; he was gentle; he was an excellent marksman,\\" all features which gave the series greater latitude with a western format. Houston was also described as follows: > He would ride, shoot, fight, drink, and love with the best of them and maybe > better than most. The modesty that he displays in day-to-day life would > disappear as soon as he enters a courtroom, becoming the flamboyant attorney > famous throughout the American Southwest. Though Hunter was an optimistic person and a collegial colleague on the set, Temple Houston proved illusory for his long-term career prospects. Hunter thought that the series had found its voice beginning with the 12th episode, \\"Enough Rope\\", by having adopted the light-hearted approach of ABC's former Maverick western series. As Hunter explained the change in format, the series was \\"conceived in humor and delivered in dead seriousness. Then, about halfway through the season, NBC decided to return to the tongue-in-cheek approach. By that time it was too late. The big joke around town was that the series was about a synagogue in Texas.\\" In taking the Temple Houston role, Hunter was compelled by a scheduling conflict to bow out of John Ford's final western film, Cheyenne Autumn. Hunter died in 1969 at the age of 42, having undergone unsuccessful brain surgery following a stroke that had been apparently triggered by a household fall.

The founder of the dynasty, Gulab Singh, was an influential noble in the court of Maharaja Ranjit Singh of Lahore, while his brother Dhian Singh served as the prime minister of the Sikh empire. Appointed by Ranjit Singh as the hereditary Raja of the Jammu principality, Gulab Singh established his supremacy over all the hill states surrounding the Kashmir Valley. After the First Anglo-Sikh War in 1846, under the terms of the Treaty of Lahore, 1846, the British Indian government acquired Kashmir from the Sikh Empire and transferred it to Gulab Singh, recognising him as an independent Maharaja. Thus Jammu and Kashmir was established as one of the largest princely states in British India, receiving a 21-gun salute for its Maharaja in 1921. It was ruled by Gulab Singh and his descendants till 1947. The last ruling Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir was Hari Singh, who contributed troops to the British war effort in World War II and served on Churchill's Imperial War Cabinet. Following the Partition of India in 1947, Hari Singh faced a rebellion in the western districts of the state and a Pakistan-supported tribal invasion, leading him to accede to the Union of India and receive military assistance. Pakistan contested the accession, giving rise to the enduring Kashmir conflict. With India's support, the popular leader of Jammu and Kashmir, Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah, forced the Maharaja to abdicate in favour of his son, Yuvraj (Crown Prince) Karan Singh, who subsequently accepted the position of a constitutional head of state (Sadr-i-Riyasat) and voluntarily gave up the title of Maharaja. Etymology The term Dogra is thought to derive from Durgara, the name of a kingdom mentioned in an eleventh century copper-plate inscription in Chamba. In medieval times the term became Dugar, which later turned into Dogra. Kalhana's Rajatarangini makes no mention of a kingdom by this name, but it could have been referred to by its capital (ether Vallapura, modern Balor, or Babbapura, modern Babor). In modern times, the term Dogra turned into an ethnic identity, claimed by all those people that speak the Dogri language. The family of Raja Gulab Singh is referred to as Jamwal (or Jamuwal). According to some accounts, Raja Kapur Dev, who ruled the area of Jammu around 1560 AD had two sons named Jag Dev and Samail Dev. The two sons ruled from the Bahu and Jammu on the opposite banks of the Tawi River and their descendants came to be called Bahuwals and Jamuwals respectively. The members of the family however claim descent from a legendary Suryavanshi (solar) dynasty ruler Jambu Lochan, who is believed to have founded the city of Jammu in antiquity. History of Jamwal rulers Raja Dhruv Dev laid down the foundations of the Jamwal rulers of Jammu in 1703. His son Raja Ranjit Dev (1728‚Äì1780), introduced social reforms such as a ban on sati (immolation of the wife on the pyre of the husband) and female infanticide. Raja Ranjit Dev was succeeded by Raja Braj Dev who killed his brother and nephew to become king. Braj Dev was killed during the Sikh invasion of Jammu in 1787. His infant son Raja Sampuran Singh (1787‚Äì1797) succeeded with Jammu becoming an autonomous tributary under the Sikh Confederacy Misls. Sampuran Singh with no issue, was succeeded by his uncle Raja Jit Singh. Jit Singh was involved in another conflict with the Sikh empire, which he lost and was exiled into British territory. With Jammu fully annexed by the Sikhs around 1808, Ranjit Singh first allotted it to his son Kharak Singh. However, Kharak Singh's agents were unable to maintain law and order, with locals led by Mian Dedo rebelling against the Sikh jagirdar (governor). In 1820, Ranjit Singh then bestowed the territory as a hereditary fiefdom to Gulab Singh's father Kishore Singh, a distant kinsman of Raja Jit Singh. On his father's death in 1822, Jammu passed to Gulab Singh. Gulab Singh Maharaja Gulab Singh, the founder of princely state of Jammu and Kashmir Around 1808, Jammu became part of the Sikh Empire, under Maharaja Ranjit Singh. Ranjit Singh in 1820, bestowed the place as a jagir on Gulab Singh's father Kishore Singh, who belonged to the Jamwal Rajput clan that ruled Jammu. As a jagirdar (governor) for the Sikhs, Gulab Singh extended the boundaries of the Sikh Empire to western Tibet with the help of his fine General Zorawar Singh. The Sikh rule was then extended beyond the Jammu Region and the Kashmir Valley to include the Tibetan Buddhist Kingdom of Ladakh and the Emirates of Hunza, Gilgit and Nagar. In the turmoil for succession of the Sikh empire that followed Maharaja Ranjit Singh's death in 1839, two of Gulab Singh's sons Udham Singh, and Sohan Singh were killed in the feuding between the Sikh heirs. His youngest brother Suchet Singh, was killed by his own nephew Hira Singh, the Vizir (prime minister) of the Sikh empire. Hira Singh, was a great favourite of Maharaja Ranjit Singh and Gulab Singh once even aspired to have him installed as the Sikh emperor. Hira Singh had become prime minister aged 24, after his father and Gulab Singh's brother Vizir Dhian Singh was assassinated in his blotched September 1843 coup d'√©tat against Sikh emperor Sher Singh in Lahore. During the regency of Maharani Jind Kaur, Hira Singh was killed by the Sikh army in December 1844. Gulab Singh, came into possession of the Koh-i-noor diamond, after Maharaja Kharak Singh's mysterious death in prison in 1840, and had previously presented the famous stone to Maharaja Sher Singh to win his favour. After the First Anglo-Sikh War in 1846, Sir Henry Lawrence was appointed British Resident and Vizir Lal Singh on behalf of infant emperor Duleep Singh was asked to surrender Kashmir.Raja Lal Singh Vizir Lal Singh was also a Dogra, and along with Gulab Singh colluded with the British to deliberately break the Sikh army and facilitate the British victory. Under the terms of the Treaty of Amritsar that followed in March 1846, the British government sold Kashmir for a sum of 7.5 million Nanakshahee rupees to Gulab Singh, hereafter bestowed with the title of Maharaja. Thus the Princely State of Jammu and Kashmir came into being under Gulab Singh, as per the treaty of Lahore, signed between the British and the Sikhs. Maharaja Partab Singh (enthroned in 1885) saw the construction of Banihal Cart Road (B.C. Road) mainly to facilitate telegraph services. During WWI he provided one Mountain Battery and three Infantry Battalions to fight for the British in East Africa, Palestine and Mesopotamia. For the services of his troops the state was awarded a hereditary 21-guns salute. One of the main residences of the maharajas was the Sher Garhi Palace in their summer capital Srinagar.

The last ruler of Jammu and Kashmir was Maharaja Hari Singh, who ascended the throne in 1925. He made primary education compulsory in the State, introduced laws prohibiting child marriage and threw open places of worship for the low castes. Hari Singh was as a member of Churchill's British War Cabinet in WWII, and supplied troops for the Allies. Singh's reign saw the accession of Jammu and Kashmir to the newly independent Indian Union in 1947. He originally manoeuvered to maintain his independence by playing off India and Pakistan against each other. There was an armed movement against the Maharaja's rule especially in the Poonch district of Jammu, when his troops were unable to control these fighters and his troops retreated to Jammu, in October 1947, Singh appealed to India for its help. He acceded to India, though there is considerable controversy over exactly at what point, and whether or not his accession included the sovereignty of the state. In June 1952, Singh's rule was terminated by the state government of Indian-administered Kashmir. His son Yuvraj (Crown Prince) Karan Singh too abdicated and was elected Sadr-e-Riyasat ('President of the Province') and Governor of the State in 1964. Dogras in Politics post 1952 Yuvraj (Crown Prince) Karan Singh after serving as the President of Jammu and Kashmir from 1952-64 would go on to become the youngest cabinet minister as a leading member the Indian Congress Party in 1967.

Ajatshatru Singh had served with the NC as a minister in the Jammu and Kashmir Government from 1996 to 2002.

After graduating from Pikeville College, according to Mr Riddle, he entered the Naval Academy, but left after a year because he wanted to fly airplanes, which he learned to do with the US Army Air Service in Texas after first learning to overhaul plane engines... allowing him to fulfill his boyhood dream of becoming a barnstormer, flying cross country giving rides to people at fairs, having girls write messages on the wings of his Jenny, the plane he loved best. As a young man Paul Riddle was married to and divorced from an opera singer named Grace, whose last name is lost in time, perhaps because they had no children. In 1948 he married Adele Goeser and her four children. They had two more children and were divorced in 1969, but ended up as friends living in the same house in Coral Gables, Florida where aged 87 Riddle came down with an illness and died in his sleep a few days later, April 6, 1989. His ashes were scattered over the Atlantic. And he's remembered by a marker at Oak Ridge Cemetery in Arcadia, Florida, surrounded by the honored graves of RAF cadets who died learning to fly.  Embry-Riddle  On December 17, 1925, exactly 22 years after the Wright Brothers' first flight, Riddle and T. Higbee Embry formed the Embry- Riddle Company at Lunken Airport in Cincinnati, Ohio. Riddle had met Embry two years prior, while Riddle was barnstorming in Ohio. He had landed at a polo field, offered Embry a ride in his plane, and from then on they were good friends. Riddle was named general manager, and the two began to sell Waco Aircraft in Cincinnati. In spring of 1926, the Embry-Riddle Company opened the Embry-Riddle Flying School. The school grew rapidly in 1928 and 1929, until the Embry-Riddle Company (now the Embry-Riddle Aviation Corporation) was merged with the Aviation Corporation (AVCO) of Delaware. AVCO phased out the Embry-Riddle Flying School in the fall of 1930. Shortly after, AVCO became American Airways (the predecessor of American Airlines), and the Embry-Riddle Company was gone. In 1939, Riddle was ready to get back into the business of training pilots. He contacted Embry, who had no interest in reentering a partnership with Riddle. Riddle, now living in Miami, Florida, found a partner in John G. McKay and his wife, Isabel. Keeping the Embry-Riddle name, they reestablished the Embry-Riddle School of Aviation (now the Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University), partnering with the University of Miami to provide flight training under the Civilian Pilot Training Program, increasing the number of pilots immediately proceeding World War II. Riddle and McKay also formed the Riddle Aeronautical Institute at Carlstrom Field in Arcadia, Florida on March 22, 1941 for the purpose of training pilots for the United States Army Air Corps. A separate division of Embry-Riddle provided technical training in maintenance and metal work. McKay purchased Riddle's share of Embry-Riddle in 1944 and from then on the two co-founders of the original Embry-Riddle were no longer involved.  Other companies  Riddle also founded many other aviation related companies and schools. The J.P. Riddle Company was a school founded in 1939. The flying and technical school was so large that it contracted five flying schools to the US and British governments. A Brazilian school, Escola Tecnica de Aviacao, was established in 1943 and was located in Sao Paulo, Brazil. In May 1945, J.P. Riddle Company used some aircraft to relocate American transport instructors to his school in Brazil. This regularly scheduled service was operated by Riddle Airlines, which was incorporated by Riddle.

The club is a member of the Welsh Rugby Union and is a feeder club for the Scarlets. History =Early history= A Carmarthen Journal from 1871 first confirms the existence of Llandeilo RFC; when it covered an event between the club and three other teams, namely Neath, Lampeter College and Llandovery College. In their inaugural year Llandeilo RFC played on a ground known as the Bridge Field. Due to the death of one of their players, rugby in Llandeilo appeared to wane and the game lost support. But in 1875 interest was rekindled by locals, and rugby was once again played, but now on Gurrey Fach Field. Competitive Rugby was first played by Llandeilo in the 1877‚Äì78 season when the club entered the South Wales Challenge Cup competition as one of the inaugurating teams;Fields of Praise, The Official History of The Welsh Rugby Union 1881‚Äì1981 pp43 David Smith, Gareth Williams (1980) and on 12 March 1881, Llandeilo RFC was one of the eleven clubs who met in Neath to found the Welsh Rugby Union.Fields of Praise, The Official History of the Welsh Rugby Union 1881‚Äì1981 pp41, David Smith, Gareth Williams (1980) George Davies was the first player to graduate from Llandeilo RFC to play for his Wales. He joined Swansea RFC in 1898 and became a Welsh international in 1899‚Äì1900, winning three caps (awarded for playing at an international level) against the other home nations during that season. He won a further six caps playing in the 1901 and 1905 Triple Crown sides. =1914 to 1945= Rugby came to a standstill from 1914 until 1919, during World War I but on the cessation of hostilities in 1919, rugby returned to Llandeilo. It was in 1919 that their president, the Rt. Hon. Lord Dynevor, provided Cae William to become the club's permanent ground. In the early 1920s support for rugby union in the area lessened. The advent of Association Football was a particular draw to the youth of the town and Llandeilo RFC were forced into liquidation and they did not renew their membership of the WRU. From 1925 to 1934 no competitive rugby union was played at Llandeilo; but in 1934 a game was organised and played against Haverfordwest RFC. =Post 1945= After World War II, Llandeilo RFC applied to and successfully joined the Llanelli and District Junior Rugby Union. It was during this period that they won their first trophy in 1953‚Äì54, the Llanelli and District Rugby Union Knock-out Cup. In 1949 Llandeilo were once again members of the WRU and during this time club membership flourished; and in 1954 the club became members of the West Wales Rugby Union in 1954, but their progress in the West Wales Rugby Union was fairly poor over the next ten years without any significant success. In 1969, Llandeilo's new clubhouse was opened; and in the 70's Llandeilo Athletic club purchased Cae William on behalf of Llandeilo RFC. =Modern day= In the 1986‚Äì87 season, Llandeilo RFC won Section E of the West Wales Rugby Union Championship. The club also reformed the junior sections, which allowed a basis for future talent and growth. During the 1990s the club experienced some success on the field but controversy off it. By 1993 the club found itself in the Premier Division of the WWRU for the very first time, but in the early months of 1993 the club found itself in the midst of a criminal investigation. A fund raising attempt by the club resulted in the defaulting of payments by certain sponsors. Eventually the WRU and police were informed and the Welsh media investigated the story. On investigation it transpired that the club had a higher allocation of International Tickets than the committee had been led to believe, and in the aftermath, club secretary Joe Harries resigned. The 1995‚Äì96 season saw the introduction of professionalism and the National Leagues; Llandeilo were placed in Division 6 West. The year 2000 saw a new 100 seater stand facility opened at Cae William.; which was unveiled by Llanelli star player Ray Gravell. The 2008/09 season saw Llandeilo get promoted with an unbeaten season.

Mudiao is characterised by detailed fretwork, and is sometimes covered with gold foil. Mudiao products include chests, furniture, screens and even buildings. Chippendale was strongly influenced by mudiao work. Woods Used Generally, hardwoods are chosen that are stable and moderately dense, and hence difficult to carve. However, for some carvings aromatic woods such as the tung tree are chosen. Typical woods include: *Nanmu, durable softwood *Zitan (Red sandalwood) *Zhangmu (Camphor tree, Cinnamomum camphora) *Bomu, various species in the family Cupressaceae, especially the aromatic Glyptostrobus *Yinxing (Ginkgo biloba) *Hongmu (Padauk, Redwood or Blackwood), Suan Zhi in Cantonese *Longan (Dragon Eye) *Mahogany Methodology Classical mudiao is begun by selecting a whole block of wood, sawing it into a regular shape, such as a square flat board, then using edged carving tools to sculpt pictures either in bas-relief or in three-dimensions. Burls, known as Ying wood or \\" Yingzi\\" from a variety of trees are used for carving figurines and standalone sculptures. While coming from any kind of wood, burls from Phoebe trees are the most common.

Its type and only species is A. khouribgaensis, after the town of Khouribga, near which the holotype was found.

Its teeth were sharp but strong and large, as well as being less numerous than the ones in Dyrosaurus phosphaticus. Like other dyrosaurids, it was a marine predator.

Art by Alex Schomburg. Miss Fury is a fictional superhero from the Golden Age of Comics. She first appeared as The Black Fury on April 6, 1941, a Sunday comic strip distributed by the Bell Syndicate, and created by artist Tarp√© Mills.Trina Robbins,A Century of Women Cartoonists. Northampton, Mass. : Kitchen Sink Press, 1993. (pp. 62, 67‚Äì70,83).Ron Goulart, The Adventurous Decade: Comic Strips in the Thirties.New Rochelle, N.Y. : Arlington House, 1975, (p.180-1) The strip was retitled Miss Fury in November 1941. The character's real identity is wealthy socialite Marla Drake. She has no innate superpowers, but gains increased strength and speed when she dons a special skintight catsuit when fighting crime. The panther skin was bequeathed to her by her uncle, who said that it was used by an African witch doctor in voodoo ceremonies. Miss Fury combats several recurring villains, including mad scientist Diman Saraf and Nazi agents Baroness Erica Von Kampf and General Bruno. Drake was also involved in a love triangle with her former fianc√©, Gary Hale, and Detective Dan Carey. A complicated figure, Marla doesn't seem to like being a superhero, resenting the need for a secret identity and the danger it poses. She is sometimes accompanied by an albino Brazilian named Albino Joe. Although Miss Fury was popular, the revealing outfits worn by the female characters provoked some controversy at the time. When Marla Drake was drawn wearing a bikini in 1947, 37 newspapers dropped the strip in response. The Miss Fury strip ran until 1952. Marvel Comics (then known as Timely Comics) reprinted her Sunday strips in comic book form from 1942 to 1946 in eight issues published from Winter 1942 to Winter 1945. In 1979 Archival Press reissued her early adventures in graphic novel format, with a new cover by Mills. In 2011, IDW's \\"The Library of American Comics\\" put out a collection of strips covering 1944‚Äì49, they also published another volume containing the 1941‚Äì1944 Miss Fury strips in 2013.\\"IDW Publishing Solicitations for October 2013\\" Comic Book Resources, July 12th, 2013. Retrieved August 14, 2015. Other appearances Tarp√© Mills's Miss Fury was revived in a four-issue mini-series published in 1991 by Adventure Comics (an imprint of Malibu Comics). In that series, Marlene Hale dons a cat outfit from her family's attic as a Halloween costume only to end up rescuing a thirteen-year-old being assaulted by a drug dealer, after which her grandfather reveals that she is the granddaughter of the original Miss Fury. A caped and bare-legged gun-wielding version of Miss Fury appears calling herself \\"Black Fury\\", extorting drug dealers and committing murders. At the same time, Marlene's aunt Stephanie also adopts a jacket-wearing version of the Miss Fury persona. Marlene and her grandfather independently suspect that Stephanie is the Black Fury, while Stephanie suspects the same of Marlene, and a battle between the two ends when both fall into a vat of chemicals. On another night, Merlene defeats Stephanie, who concedes the mantle of the Black Fury to Marlene, and they realize that the Black Fury must be a third person. As the true Miss Fury, Marlene tracks down and defeats the Black Fury, who is revealed to be the drug dealer Marlene originally fought. This version of Miss Fury, now with increased strength and aggression from falling into the vat of chemicals, would return in issues 10‚Äì12 of Malibu Comics' Protectors series. Black Fury, who Marlene again suspects of being a similarly chemically enhanced version of her aunt Stephanie, has kidnapped the grandson of President Brian O'Brien (the former Clock). Miss Fury helps the Protectors rescue the grandson, but Black Fury slips away. Miss Fury would continue to appear in the pages of The Protectors until the series ended with issue #20 in 1994. The original Miss Fury also saw a brief cameo reappearance in 2008 when Marvel Comics published the first issue of the series The Twelve. She was depicted as part of an army of 1940s costumed heroes storming Berlin, Nazi Germany during the final days of World War II. In November 2012, the Golden Age Miss Fury appeared in the eight issue Dynamite Entertainment mini- series Masks, where she joined with other comic and pulp-magazine heroes (including Zorro, the Shadow and the Green Hornet) to combat the villainous \\"Party of Justice\\".\\"EXCLUSIVE FIRST LOOK: Lee, Syaf & Francavilla Cover \\"Masks\\" #1\\" Comic Book Resources. August 17, 2012. Retrieved August 14, 2015. In April 2013 Dynamite began publishing a comic book series with an updated version of the Golden Age Miss Fury, which ran for eleven issues through 2014, collected as Miss Fury: Anger is an Energy and Miss Fury: Walk Through the Valley. During the same period, she appeared alongside the Sparrow (of The Shadow) in the five issue mini-series Noir, collected in Noir: The Mohawk Templar. In 2015, she reappeared in the six issue mini-series, Masks 2. A second volume of the Miss Fury series, collected as Miss Fury: The Minor Key, ran for six issues in 2016. A three-issue third volume titled Miss Fury: Joy Division was announced in 2018 for an October release, but was delayed again in favor of a September 15, 2019 release, before finally being announced for an early 2021 release as a trade-paperback following a successful Indiegogo campaign.

The novel was adapted into a TV drama, Back Home (1990), starring Hayley Mills and Haley Carr, and again in 2001 starring Sarah Lancashire, Stephanie Cole and Jessica Fox. Plot summary Twelve-year-old Virginia 'Rusty' Dickinson (so-called due to her auburn hair) is an evacuee returning home to England near the end of World War Two. After having lived in the US since the age of seven, Rusty barely remembers England or her parents, and hasn't met her four-year-old brother Charlie at all. Rusty's an outgoing, confident, creative girl who loves the outdoors and working with her hands. The story opens with Rusty's arrival at the docks in Plymouth where she is greeted by her mother, Peggy. Rusty initially doesn't recognise Peggy who, in turn, is taken aback by how grown-up her daughter is. Rusty is surprised to see how run down the town is, how shabby her mother's clothes are, and shocked by the bombed out buildings they pass. Rusty and Peggy make the journey to the countryside near Totnes where Peggy and Charlie have been living during the war. There Rusty meets Beatie, the old friendly woman who owns the house, Ivy, a young woman whose first husband is missing, presumed dead, and who is now engaged to an American G.I., Ivy's five-year-old daughter Susan, and Charlie. Charlie, who was born while Rusty was in the US, is suspicious and unwelcoming towards his new sister. Rusty spends the following days feeling out of place in her new home. Peggy is cool and distant towards her, treats her like a child, and scolds her for unexpectedly mundane things, like talking about her American family, the Omsks. Rusty feels resentful towards her mother as Peggy doesn't appear to want to get to know her daughter, and instead spends a large portion of her days out working as a mechanic with the Women's Volunteer Service. Their mutual incomprehension comes to a head when Rusty heads out alone on the river in a rowboat, only to return hours later to find her mother furious with her for leaving without permission. The owner of the boat, thirteen-year-old Beth Hatherley, is initially angry with Rusty for taking the boat, however soon softens towards Rusty. They strike up the beginnings of a friendship, but are hampered by Peggy's protectiveness. Beth introduces Rusty to her three siblings and tells her about her school, a forward-thinking and progressive place (possibly based on Dartington Hall School considering the setting) that encourages creativity and independence. Rusty overhears her mother telling Beatie that the school isn't the right kind of place to receive a serious education, and that she is set in her plans to send Rusty to boarding school. This makes Rusty feel even more isolated from her mother. The only person aside from Beth to show Rusty any real warmth or affection is Beatie. With the declaration of Japanese surrender marking the end of the war, Peggy reluctantly takes the children back to their home in Guildford, Surrey, where they lived before the war, and where Rusty's paternal grandmother still lives. Rusty is disappointed to find that her grandmother is different to Beatie in every sense: she disapproves of Peggy's work as a mechanic, is harsh with Charlie, and has clear disdain for Rusty's American accent, clothing, and manners. As challenging as life was in Devon, Rusty finds living with her grandmother even more irksome. She endures her grandmother's snide comments until the beginning of the school term, when Rusty's sent away to school. Her new school, Benwood House, is a strict all-girls boarding school, where she will be living during the week. Peggy is permitting her to come home at weekends. To Rusty's disbelief, she finds Benwood to be even more unpleasant than Guildford. There are countless rules, many of which strike Rusty as arbitrary. Prohibited behaviour includes holding hands or hugging, getting out of bed before the morning bell, going for walks alone, putting hands in pockets, talking back, or the use of slang. These last two rules cause a great deal of trouble as Rusty is accustomed to speaking her mind and saying things like 'OK' and 'uh-huh'. Rusty struggles to make friends at Benwood. The other girls are openly hostile towards her. She's also the worst in the class at most of her subjects. The areas where she excels - art, gym, and Greek dance - are soon cancelled in favour of extra Latin and maths revision. Rusty spends her weeks shuttling between Benwood, which she hates, and Guildford, which she hates equally. She's intensely homesick and daydreams incessantly about her American family: Aunt Hannah, Uncle Bruno, Jinkie, Alice, Kathryn, and Skeet, and her best girl friend, Janey. One night she's so desperately lonely that she climbs out onto the high scaffolding that encases the school building, intending to jump off it to her death. Once she gets out there, however, she finds she can't go through with it. Instead, an idea occurs to her. She realises that she can shinny down the scaffolding, climb the school wall, and disappear into the forest for a few hours. She relishes the freedom she feels in the woods, and resolves to keep returning night after night. One day Rusty meets a boy, Lance, from a nearby school who was also a US evacuee. She discovers that Lance lived in the same town as her US grandparents, the Fitzes. For the first time since returning to England Rusty feels happy and connected with someone who understands what she's going through. Unfortunately, talking to boys is strictly forbidden at Benwood, and Rusty is severely punished. Despite this, she manages to pass a message to Lance to meet her at midnight behind her school. From then on Rusty includes Lance in her nighttime forest wanderings and the two become friends. One night they stumble upon a bombed-out cottage that has an intact, albeit bare, sitting room. Rusty dubs the room their 'cabin in the woods'. Despite Lance and the little cabin, Rusty is still desperately lonely. Her unhappiness is compounded by the news that Beatie, who has always complained of 'ruddy indigestion', has died. Rusty and Peggy go to Devon for the reading of Beatie's will. Beatie leaves Rusty her collection of woodworking tools and leaves Peggy the house, with the condition that she's not to sell it for seventeen years and, if she does choose to sell it after that time, that she only sell it to a woman. Rusty and Peggy spend the weekend in Devon and start to get to know each other a little better. Rusty discovers that her mother is actually fun and adventurous and that they surprisingly have quite a lot in common. Upon their return to Guildford, things are made worse when Rusty's father, Roger, returns from Asia where he's been stationed in the army. A hard man, Roger fails to connect with Rusty, Peggy, or Charlie. He belittles Peggy, is harsh with Charlie, and is horrified by Rusty's boldness. Rusty watches her mother struggle to come to terms with Roger's return. Roger is surprised that Rusty comes home at weekends and thinks it would be better if she were a full-time boarder. He also thinks it unnecessary that she's in the university-geared A-stream at school, instead suggesting that she would be better off doing a cookery course when she graduates and then getting married. While Rusty resents her mother's insistence on academic excellence, her father's plan for marrying her off seems no more appealing. After the Christmas break, during which things deteriorate rapidly between Rusty and Roger, Rusty returns to Benwood House with a letter from her parents informing the headmistress that Rusty is to no longer come home on weekends, and is to instead become a full- time boarder. Rusty neglects to pass on the letter. When the weekend rolls around she leaves the school as usual but, instead of being greeted by Peggy, slips away into the forest. She spends the weekend sprucing up the cabin in the woods. She finds and repairs old furniture in the rubble. She paints the walls with traditional American stencils, washes the curtains, builds shelves, and chops wood. She returns to school on Monday with nobody the wiser. She does the same thing the following weekend, and then the weekend after that. Once back at school, she's brought back to reality when the headmistress announces the impending removal of the scaffolding, effectively ending Rusty's nighttime adventures. Panicked, Rusty resolves to run away back to the Omsks'. She slips out of school one morning and heads for Plymouth, but accidentally gets off at the wrong stop. She realises that she's near Beatie's house, so walks through the wintry countryside. The journey takes her all day. As she walks she thinks about her American family, and about how they always gently reminded her that she had a real family back in England who loved her and missed her. Rusty finally reaches Beatie's house and also reaches the decision that she won't be able to run away to the US as she's grown to love her mother and doesn't want to leave her again. Thin, starved, and freezing, Rusty falls asleep on the floor in Beatie's empty house. She's woken by Beth and Mrs Hatherley wrapping her in blankets and lighting a fire to keep her warm. Rusty returns to Benwood with Mrs Hatherly to find police officers, teachers, and Peggy frantic with worry. Police have discovered the cabin in the woods. Peggy is astounded by Rusty's decorating talent and, once she sees the height of the scaffolding, appreciates for the first time how desperate Rusty must have been to have scaled it in the dark. Rusty and Peggy are summoned to see the headmistress. Rusty is expelled from Benwood and told that no other school will have her. Peggy and Rusty return to Guildford to face Roger and Mrs Dickinson Senior's wrath. The final chapter of the story leaps forward several months to spring. The reader learns that Peggy has left Roger and has taken Rusty and Charlie back to live in Beatie's house in Devon. Rusty has accepted that she will probably always feel a bit American, but that her life in England has its own beauty and joy. She feels the budding potential for real happiness as she gets to know her mother better. Rusty has her own room which she has been given free rein to decorate. She has also been enrolled in the progressive school attended by Beth and the Hatherly brothers. On Rusty's first day, Peggy and Charlie take her to school, where she's shown around by Beth's brother Harry. She sees the way teachers speak respectfully to the students and the way that students seem to genuinely enjoy being at school. The story ends with Rusty meeting some fellow students who show an interest in her and have the potential to become real friends.  Characters  Virginia 'Rusty' Dickinson Evacuated from Britain at age 7 as a timid and shy child, 12-year-old Rusty returns as a confident and very American teenager. During her evacuation she stayed in Connecticut with the lively Omsk family, who encouraged her talents and belief in herself, drawing her out of her shell. Rusty loves bright colours, art and music- she has especially talent at woodwork and stencil crafts which she was taught by 'Aunt' Hannah Omsk. Initially unhappy on her return to England, Rusty finds friends in Beth & Beattie Langley and refuses to alter her character to fit in with the hidebound English girls. Rusty can be considered brave, outspoken, creative and passionate. Although Rusty spends most of the novel disliking being back in England after the freedom and acceptance of America, she grows to love her mother and brother and is happy when they return to Devon, no longer thinking of America as her home. Margaret 'Peggy' Dickinson Forced to evacuate her little daughter during the war, Peggy joined the WVS and become a stronger woman through it with a talent for vehicle mechanics. Before her marriage Peggy lived with her parents and after her marriage she lived with her husband and mother in law. Through her friendship with Beattie and Harvey, Peggy learns self confidence and to trust her own judgement which was not encouraged when she lived with her husband as she was seen as inferior to Roger and his mother. Peggy is a good example of how British women's roles changed during the war, moving into jobs traditionally held by men and often becoming the sole breadwinner for their family because of being widowed or their husbands being away fighting. Charlie Dickinson Born while his father was away fighting, Charlie is in the sole care of his mother in Devon until the family move back to London. Much like Virginia, Charlie has red hair and likes music and the outdoors although he initially doesn't like his sister as he is not used to sharing his mother. He had a father figure in his mother's American GI friend Uncle Harvey, whom he adored, and he carries his teddy bear with him everywhere. He is miserable when they leave Devon for London, hating his grandmother and father who are unkind to him and missing his friends. He gets in to trouble for picking flowers from neighbouring gardens, not understanding that the flowers in London are not wild as he is used to. He develops the habit of wetting his bed in London but stops when he returns to Devon. Roger Dickinson A traditional upper middle class Englishman, Roger has spent the past few years away fighting and returns to discover a changed world - his wife is self-sufficient, his daughter very Americanised and his son has no bond with him at all and keeps talking about Uncle Harvey. Roger thinks of Charlie as being 'namby-pamby and tied to his mother's apron strings', although failing to see that he has to try and get to know his children. Roger is also tied to his own mother and gives her more respect in the household than Peggy. Roger is not deliberately unkind or unfeeling, but has trouble adjusting to the changes in his family and to the altered England he returns to. He represents the old England before the war and the problems which come from not adapting or being open to change. Grandmother A domineering, selfish and snobbish woman, Grandmother is the opposite of Beattie Langley, who has become a mother figure to Peggy. Refusing to contribute to the war effort, she has preserved her house entirely as it was before the war and is displeased with her grandchildren and daughter in law. Rusty often clashes with her, saying that \\"you are always bitching about someone or other in your sugary voice\\". Has a bad habit of taking the phone off the hook and other controlling ways. The Honourable Beatie Langley The Devon landlady of Peggy and Charlie, Beatie is a warm and welcome presence in the story. Kind, open minded, cheerful, perceptive and generous, Beatie gave away all of her curtains and many possessions to help the war effort ‚Äì material was in short supply ‚Äì and happily shared her rambling and leaky-roofed house with several women who were serving in the forces. Beatie, while never openly saying so, clearly knows about Peggy's home situation and after her death she leaves Peggy her house on condition that Peggy can't sell for 17 years nor can the house be held in a man's name, thus giving Peggy a way to escape her marriage if she wants to by preventing Roger forcing Peggy to put the house into his name. Beatie shows how some people adjusted well with proper British spirit to the trials of war. She dies of her \\"ruddy indigestion\\" which is likely to be stomach cancer. Lance A fellow sea evacuee of Rusty's, Lance attends the boys' school near Rusty's and is also ostracised for his American accent and behaviour. He provides Rusty with a friend as he sneaks out to meet her in their cabin in the woods, admires her talent with handicrafts and they help each other with their schoolwork. Lance's parents are getting divorced and to escape the house he goes for long runs in the holidays which leads to him joining the school rugby team and being accepted by other students.  Minor characters  Beth a local Devon girl who becomes friends with Rusty, Beth is practical and forthright. When Rusty runs away she goes to Beth's house after deciding not to try and get to America. Beth and her mother then accompany Rusty back to London and remain with her until Peggy arrives. When Peggy, Rusty and Charlie return to Devon, Beth helps Rusty and Charlie be accepted into the local school and becomes a close friend. Ivy The other woman resident in Beattie's house, Ivy has a little girl of Charlie's age and her husband is Missing Believed Killed. Ivy marries an American GI who was a friend of Uncle Harvey but during the novel her husband is found in a POW camp, making the second marriage void, despite Ivy being heavily pregnant with her new husband's child. This was a situation that did happen quite often during the war, when one partner was presumed dead and their spouse moved on, only to discover that they were alive years later and that their new union wasn't lawful. Uncle Harvey Although he does not appear in person in the novel as he has returned to America, Harvey was a good friend to Peggy and a father figure to Charlie who constantly mentions how Harvey would play with him and spend time with him. Harvey has a fiancee living back home in the US. Harvey and Peggy enjoyed spending time together, although Peggy denies that there was anything inappropriate about their relationship or that they were lovers. Harvey represents the idea of a more modern man who takes on childcare duties and is more open with his wife, as well as being the type of father Charlie would have loved to have. Juxtaposed with Roger, Harvey is a sympathetic and kind man who shows Peggy that she is worth more than Roger seems to think. Aunt Hannah and Uncle Bruno Omsk Rusty's American host family, the Omsks embraced their role as surrogate parents, however always made sure Rusty never referred to them as 'Mom' or 'Pop'. Encouraging, kind and reasonable, the Omsks are creative and practical people who continue to send Rusty letters and presents. Adaptations In 1990 the novel was adapted to a television film, directed by Piers Haggard and produced by Television South and the Walt Disney Company starring, Hayley Mills as Mrs. Peggy Dickinson, Hayley Carr as Virginia \\"Rusty\\" Dickinson, Adam Stevenson as Charles \\"Charlie\\" Dickinson, Brenda Bruce as The Honourable Lady Beatrice \\"Beatie\\" Langley, Jean Anderson as Grandmother Dickinson and Rupert Frazer as Mr. Roger Dickinson.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099084/?ref_=ttfc_fc_tt In 2001, a feature film was also made.

James spent twenty-four years as a professional, both beginning and ending his career with different versions of the Seattle Sounders. He played in the North American Soccer League, Major Indoor Soccer League, American Professional Soccer League and A-League. He served as an assistant coach with the Sounders for seven seasons and as interim head coach for one. He was a member of the U.S. Olympic soccer team which qualified for, but did not play in, the 1980 Summer Olympics due to the United States' boycott in response to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. He also earned two caps with the U.S. national team in 1988. High school While born in England, James grew up along with his brothers: Greg, Joe, Chris, and David and sister Tara, in Washington state. He attended Bellevue High School in Bellevue, Washington where he was a four-year letterman on the boys' soccer team. He was named to the all League team as a senior in 1977. NASL Rather than attending college, James chose to sign with the Seattle Sounders of the North American Soccer League (NASL) after graduating from high school. In his two and a half years with the Sounders, he never played a first team game, instead he saw time only with the reserve team during the 1978 and 1979 seasons. The Sounders traded him to the Edmonton Drillers in 1980 where he became an integral part of the team over the next three seasons. In addition to playing outdoor with the Drillers, James was a significant part of the 1980‚Äì1981 and 1981‚Äì1982 NASL indoor seasons. In 1981, Edmonton won the NASL indoor championship over the Chicago Sting. The Drillers folded at the end of the 1982 outdoor season and James jumped to Major Indoor Soccer League (MISL). MISL James signed with the Cleveland Force of MISL in 1982 and spent five seasons with them. He was named the 1982-1983 MISL Defender of the Year. In 1987, he moved to the Tacoma Stars for two seasons before returning to Cleveland to join the Cleveland Crunch which had replaced the Force when that team folded in 1988. James spent two more seasons in MISL with the Force, being named a second team All Star in his last season, 1990-1991. APSL/A-League In 1988 and 1989, James played two seasons with the Seattle Storm of the Western Soccer Alliance. In 1990, the WSA merged with the American Soccer League to form the American Professional Soccer League. In April 1994, James signed with the Seattle Sounders of the (APSL) as a player/coach. He played seventeen games of the 1994 season, but was injured during the 1995 pre-season and played no games as the Sounders won the APSL championship. He returned to the field in 1996, seeing time in six games as Seattle won its second consecutive league championship. In 1997, he was fully recovered from injury, anchoring the Sounders defense during thirty-three games. That year, the APSL merged with the USISL and became known as the A-League. James announced his intention to retire during the 2000 pre-season. He played six games that year and retired at the end of the season. National and Olympic teams In 1979, James was selected for the U.S. soccer team at the 1979 Pan Am Games. The U.S. went 2‚Äì0 in first round group play before dropping both of its second round group games. In 1979 and 1980, James was part of the U.S. Olympic soccer team as it qualified for the 1980 Summer Olympics held in Moscow. However, James and his team mates were unable to compete when President Jimmy Carter boycotted the games following the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan. James earned his first cap with the U.S. national team in a 1‚Äì1 tie with Chile on January 6, 1988. Neil Megson, later coach of the Sounders, replaced James in the second half. His second national team game came on March 6, 1988. This was a 3‚Äì1 loss to Chile. James again started the game but came off for Joey Kirk. Coaching In 1997, James was hired by Roosevelt High School in Seattle, Washington to coach its girls' soccer team. That year he also became a coach with Crossfire Premier Soccer Club where he continues to coach today. In 2003, he became the club's boys' director of coaching. James became interim head coach of the Sounders when Neil Megson resigned on April 19, 2001. The Sounders finished the season 14-13-2 and failed to make the playoffs. . Currently, James coaches at Crossfire, a youth soccer club in the Eastside, where he coaches at the Premier Boys level.

National Service) is an alternative voluntary national service in Israel for those that cannot or do not wish to serve in the Israel Defense Forces. The majority who receive an exemption from the obligatory army service are Jewish women from the Religious Zionist sector, and they receive it by declaring religious observance, as they maintain that a large number of religious observances for women cannot be upheld in the military, such as dress codes and modesty issues. However, there are also a small number of men who serve in Sherut Leumi. Volunteers are between the ages of 18 and 21. Sherut Leumi gives young women (and occasionally young men) exposure to a number of environments in Israeli society. Service typically requires working 30‚Äì40 hours/week over 12 to 24 months. Volunteers have the option of doing either one or two years of the National Service. Not all volunteers are Israeli citizens. It can be done on a tourist visa, and the volunteer will later receive a special volunteer visa that lasts as long as the person will be doing their service. Young people in other sectors of Israeli society receive exemptions from the military. These include mainly Haredi men who maintain that Torah study is the main practice for defending Israel; they are exempted under the Torato Umanuto arrangements. Arab citizens of Israel are also exempted, in order to avoid a conflict between allegiance to their country and to their Arab brothers (a decision originally taken by Israel's first Prime Minister, David Ben-Gurion). Historically, very few did, but in recent years, the number of Arab youths volunteering for national service has increased. Some Israeli conscientious objectors who object to serving in the army, but are not eligible for an exemption, have voiced a wish to do an alternative form of national service instead. In 2012, after much discussion and debate, Israel's cabinet extended military service exemption for 1,300 Haredi Yeshiva students as part of the Shirut Le'umi Mishmar. This allows Yeshiva students to join national service, as opposed to joining the IDF. As part of the scheme, the defense minister is obliged to postpone the military service of Yeshiva students approved for national civil service, and who are at least 26 years old, or are at least 22 years old and have at least one child.http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/israel-extends-idf-service- exemption-for-ultra-orthodox-men-1.483665 Programs Youths work in various programs. The majority work in schools, but can also work in places such as special education, administration, hospitals,See for e.g. https://www.szmc.org.il/eng/hr/volunteers/sherut-leumi/ law, geriatrics, nursing homes, health clinics, teens at risk, internal security, disadvantaged communities, immigrant assistance, and many other organizations. Acceptance is based on an interview via a placement organizations that try to find the youth appropriate skills, interests, and needs.Regarding placement organizations, see for e.g. http://bat-ami.org.il/english/ Placement organizations There are four main placement organizations for Sherut Leumi. They are the Agudah LeHitnadvut (lit. Volunteering Union), Shlomit, Aminadav, and Bat Ami. Each volunteer is then assigned to a coordinator (rakezet), who serves as a supervisor and adviser for the youth throughout their time in Sherut Leumi. Benefits Bnot Sherut (lit. female youth in the service) and Bnei Sherut (lit. male youth in the service) are entitled to a number of benefits during their service. Many of these benefits are the same as what a soldier serving in the army receives. They include: * Monthly stipend for necessities. Amount varies with location and type of service, though usually is approximately 600 Shekels a month. * Apartment housing in the city where they are serving. * Free bus rides across the country (except Eilat) * Discounts offered by various business establishments. * Social Programs such as weekend getaways, tours, learning programs, and parties. * Weekly classes are often available, and sometimes required, on various Judaism-related subjects. * At the end of the service, the Israeli volunteers receive a grant that can be used for things such education, buying a house, or paying for a wedding. * Foreign volunteers receive private medical insurance. * Free train rides (Since 2001) Israeli Arabs in National Service Rather than volunteer for army service, young people who are Arab citizens of Israel have the option to volunteer for this alternative national service and receive benefits similar to those received by discharged soldiers. The volunteers are generally allocated to Arab populations, where they assist with social and community matters. there were 1,473 Arabs volunteering for national service. According to sources in the national service administration, Arab leaders are counseling youths to refrain from performing services to the Israeli state. According to a National Service official, \\"For years the Arab leadership has demanded, justifiably, benefits for Arab youths similar to those received by discharged soldiers. Now, when this opportunity is available, it is precisely these leaders who reject the state's call to come and do the service, and receive these benefits\\".Rise in Arab National Service volunteers, by Aviel Magnezi.

Muslim scholars made advances to the map-making traditions of earlier cultures, particularly the Hellenistic geographers Ptolemy and Marinus of Tyre, combined with what explorers and merchants learned in their travels across the Old World (Afro-Eurasia). Islamic geography had three major fields: exploration and navigation, physical geography, and cartography and mathematical geography. Islamic geography reached its apex with Muhammad al-Idrisi in the 12th century.https://biography.yourdictionary.com/muhammad-ibn-muhammad-al-idrisi History Islamic geography began in the 8th century, influenced by Hellenistic geography,Gerald R. Tibbetts, The Beginnings of a Cartographic Tradition, in: John Brian Harley, David Woodward: Cartography in the Traditional Islamic and South Asian Societies, Chicago, 1992, pp. 90‚Äì107 (97-100), combined with what explorers and merchants learned in their travels across the Old World (Afro-Eurasia). Muslim scholars engaged in extensive exploration and navigation during the 9th-12th centuries, including journeys across the Muslim world, in addition to regions such as China, Southeast Asia and Southern Africa. Various Islamic scholars contributed to the development of geography and cartography, with the most notable including Al-KhwƒÅrizmƒ´, Ab≈´ Zayd al-Balkhƒ´ (founder of the \\"Balkhi school\\"), Al-Masudi, Abu Rayhan Biruni and Muhammad al-Idrisi. Islamic geography was patronized by the Abbasid caliphs of Baghdad. An important influence in the development of cartography was the patronage of the Abbasid caliph al-Ma'mun, who reigned from 813 to 833. He commissioned several geographers to remeasure the distance on earth that corresponds to one degree of celestial meridian. Thus his patronage resulted in the refinement of the definition of the mile used by Arabs (mƒ´l in Arabic) in comparison to the stadion used in the Hellenistic world. These efforts also enabled Muslims to calculate the circumference of the earth. Al- Mamun also commanded the production of a large map of the world, which has not survived,Edson and Savage-Smith (2004) though it is known that its map projection type was based on Marinus of Tyre rather than Ptolemy. Islamic cartographers inherited Ptolemy's Almagest and Geography in the 9th century. These works stimulated an interest in geography (particularly gazetteers) but were not slavishly followed. Instead, Arabian and Persian cartography followed Al-KhwƒÅrizmƒ´ in adopting a rectangular projection, shifting Ptolemy's Prime Meridian several degrees eastward, and modifying many of Ptolemy's geographical coordinates. Having received Greek writings directly and without Latin intermediation, Arabian and Persian geographers made no use of T-O maps. In the 9th century, the Persian mathematician and geographer, Habash al-Hasib al-Marwazi, employed spherical trigonometry and map projection methods in order to convert polar coordinates to a different coordinate system centred on a specific point on the sphere, in this the Qibla, the direction to Mecca. Ab≈´ RayhƒÅn Bƒ´r≈´nƒ´ (973‚Äì1048) later developed ideas which are seen as an anticipation of the polar coordinate system. Around 1025, he describes a polar equi-azimuthal equidistant projection of the celestial sphere. However, this type of projection had been used in ancient Egyptian star-maps and was not to be fully developed until the 15 and 16th centuries. In the early 10th century, Ab≈´ Zayd al-Balkhƒ´, originally from Balkh, founded the \\"Balkhƒ´ school\\" of terrestrial mapping in Baghdad. The geographers of this school also wrote extensively of the peoples, products, and customs of areas in the Muslim world, with little interest in the non-Muslim realms. The \\"Balkhƒ´ school\\", which included geographers such as Estakhri, al-Muqaddasi and Ibn Hawqal, produced world atlases, each one featuring a world map and twenty regional maps. SuhrƒÅb, a late 10th-century Muslim geographer, accompanied a book of geographical coordinates with instructions for making a rectangular world map, with equirectangular projection or cylindrical equidistant projection. The earliest surviving rectangular coordinate map is dated to the 13th century and is attributed to Hamdallah al-Mustaqfi al-Qazwini, who based it on the work of SuhrƒÅb. The orthogonal parallel lines were separated by one degree intervals, and the map was limited to Southwest Asia and Central Asia. The earliest surviving world maps based on a rectangular coordinate grid are attributed to al-Mustawfi in the 14th or 15th century (who used invervals of ten degrees for the lines), and to Hafiz-i Abru (died 1430). In the 11th century, the Karakhanid Turkic scholar Mahmud al-Kashgari was the first to draw a unique Islamic world map,Hermann A. Die √§lteste t√ºrkische Weltkarte (1076 Œ∑. Ch.) // Imago Mundi: Jahrbuch der Alten Kartographie. ‚Äî Berlin, 1935. ‚Äî Bd.l. ‚Äî S. 21‚Äî28. where he illuminated the cities and places of the Turkic peoples of Central and Inner Asia. He showed the lake Issyk-Kul (in nowadays Kyrgyzstan) as the centre of the world. Ibn Battuta (1304‚Äì1368?) wrote \\"Rihlah\\" (Travels) based on three decades of journeys, covering more than 120,000 km through northern Africa, southern Europe, and much of Asia. Muslim astronomers and geographers were aware of magnetic declination by the 15th century, when the Egyptian astronomer 'Abd al-'Aziz al-Wafa'i (d. 1469/1471) measured it as 7 degrees from Cairo. =Regional cartography= Islamic regional cartography is usually categorized into three groups: that produced by the \\"Balkhƒ´ school\\", the type devised by Muhammad al-Idrisi, and the type that are uniquely foundin the Book of curiosities. The maps by the Balkhƒ´ schools were defined by political, not longitudinal boundaries and covered only the Muslim world. In these maps the distances between various \\"stops\\" (cities or rivers) were equalized. The only shapes used in designs were verticals, horizontals, 90-degree angles, and arcs of circles; unnecessary geographical details were eliminated. This approach is similar to that used in subway maps, most notable used in the \\"London Underground Tube Map\\" in 1931 by Harry Beck. Al-Idrƒ´sƒ´ defined his maps differently. He considered the extent of the known world to be 160¬∞ and had to symbolize 50 dogs in longitude and divided the region into ten parts, each 16¬∞ wide. In terms of latitude, he portioned the known world into seven 'climes', determined by the length of the longest day. In his maps, many dominant geographical features can be found. =Book on the appearance of the Earth= Muhammad ibn M≈´sƒÅ al-KhwƒÅrizmƒ´'s ' (\\"Book on the appearance of the Earth\\") was completed in 833. It is a revised and completed version of Ptolemy's Geography, consisting of a list of 2402 coordinates of cities and other geographical features following a general introduction. Al-KhwƒÅrizmƒ´, Al-Ma'mun's most famous geographer, corrected Ptolemy's gross overestimate for the length of the Mediterranean Sea (from the Canary Islands to the eastern shores of the Mediterranean); Ptolemy overestimated it at 63 degrees of longitude, while al-Khwarizmi almost correctly estimated it at nearly 50 degrees of longitude. Al-Ma'mun's geographers \\"also depicted the Atlantic and Indian Oceans as open bodies of water, not land-locked seas as Ptolemy had done. \\" Al-Khwarizmi thus set the Prime Meridian of the Old World at the eastern shore of the Mediterranean, 10‚Äì13 degrees to the east of Alexandria (the prime meridian previously set by Ptolemy) and 70 degrees to the west of Baghdad. Most medieval Muslim geographers continued to use al-Khwarizmi's prime meridian. Other prime meridians used were set by Ab≈´ Muhammad al-Hasan al-HamdƒÅnƒ´ and Habash al-Hasib al-Marwazi at Ujjain, a centre of Indian astronomy, and by another anonymous writer at Basra. =Al-Biruni= Diagram illustrating a method proposed and used by Al-Biruni to estimate the radius and circumference of the Earth in the 11th century. Abu Rayhan al-Biruni (973‚Äì1048) devised a novel method of determining the earth's radius by means of the observation of the height of a mountain. He carried it out at Nandana in Pind Dadan Khan (present-day Pakistan). He used trigonometry to calculate the radius of the Earth using measurements of the height of a hill and measurement of the dip in the horizon from the top of that hill. His calculated radius for the Earth of 3928.77 miles was 2% higher than the actual mean radius of 3847.80 miles. His estimate was given as 12,803,337 cubits, so the accuracy of his estimate compared to the modern value depends on what conversion is used for cubits. The exact length of a cubit is not clear; with an 18 inch cubit his estimate would be 3,600 miles, whereas with a 22 inch cubit his estimate would be 4,200 miles.Douglas (1973, p.211) One significant problem with this approach is that Al-Biruni was not aware of atmospheric refraction and made no allowance for it. He used a dip angle of 34 arc minutes in his calculations, but refraction can typically alter the measured dip angle by about 1/6, making his calculation only accurate to within about 20% of the true value. In his Codex Masudicus (1037), Al-Biruni theorized the existence of a landmass along the vast ocean between Asia and Europe, or what is today known as the Americas. He argued for its existence on the basis of his accurate estimations of the Earth's circumference and Afro-Eurasia's size, which he found spanned only two-fifths of the Earth's circumference, reasoning that the geological processes that gave rise to Eurasia must surely have given rise to lands in the vast ocean between Asia and Europe. He also theorized that at least some of the unknown landmass would lie within the known latitudes which humans could inhabit, and therefore would be inhabited. =Tabula Rogeriana= The Arab geographer, Muhammad al-Idrisi, produced his medieval atlas, Tabula Rogeriana or The Recreation for Him Who Wishes to Travel Through the Countries, in 1154. He incorporated the knowledge of Africa, the Indian Ocean and the Far East gathered by Arab merchants and explorers with the information inherited from the classical geographers to create the most accurate map of the world in pre-modern times. With funding from Roger II of Sicily (1097‚Äì1154), al-Idrisi drew on the knowledge collected at the University of Cordoba and paid draftsmen to make journeys and map their routes. The book describes the earth as a sphere with a circumference of but maps it in 70 rectangular sections. Notable features include the correct dual sources of the Nile, the coast of Ghana and mentions of Norway. Climate zones were a chief organizational principle. A second and shortened copy from 1192 called Garden of Joys is known by scholars as the Little Idrisi. On the work of al-Idrisi, S. P. Scott commented: Al-Idrisi's atlas, originally called the Nuzhat in Arabic, served as a major tool for Italian, Dutch and French mapmakers from the 16th century to the 18th century. =Piri Reis map= The Piri Reis map is a world map compiled in 1513 by the Ottoman admiral and cartographer Piri Reis. Approximately one third of the map survives; it shows the western coasts of Europe and North Africa and the coast of Brazil with reasonable accuracy. Various Atlantic islands, including the Azores and Canary Islands, are depicted, as is the mythical island of Antillia and possibly Japan.  Instruments  Muslim scholars invented and refined a number of scientific instruments in mathematical geography and cartography. These included the astrolabe, quadrant, gnomon, celestial sphere, sundial, and compass. = Astrolabe = Astrolabes were adopted and further developed in the medieval Islamic world, where Muslim astronomers introduced angular scales to the design,See p. 289 of adding circles indicating azimuths on the horizon. It was widely used throughout the Muslim world, chiefly as an aid to navigation and as a way of finding the Qibla, the direction of Mecca. Eighth- century mathematician Muhammad al-Fazari is the first person credited with building the astrolabe in the Islamic world.Richard Nelson Frye: Golden Age of Persia. p. 163 The mathematical background was established by Muslim astronomer Albatenius in his treatise Kitab az-Zij (c. 920 AD), which was translated into Latin by Plato Tiburtinus (De Motu Stellarum). The earliest surviving astrolabe is dated AH 315 (927‚Äì28 AD). In the Islamic world, astrolabes were used to find the times of sunrise and the rising of fixed stars, to help schedule morning prayers (salat). In the 10th century, al-Sufi first described over 1,000 different uses of an astrolabe, in areas as diverse as astronomy, astrology, navigation, surveying, timekeeping, prayer, Salat, Qibla, etc.Dr. Emily Winterburn (National Maritime Museum), Using an Astrolabe, Foundation for Science Technology and Civilisation, 2005. = Compass = Al-Ashraf's diagram of the compass and Qibla. From MS Cairo TR 105, copied in Yemen, 1293. The earliest reference to a compass in the Muslim world occurs in a Persian talebook from 1232,JawƒÅme ø al-·∏•ekƒÅyƒÅt wa- lawƒÅme ø al-rewƒÅyƒÅt by Muhammad al- øAwfƒ´ where a compass is used for navigation during a trip in the Red Sea or the Persian Gulf. The fish-shaped iron leaf described indicates that this early Chinese design has spread outside of China.Needham p. 12-13 \\"...that the floating fish-shaped iron leaf spread outside China as a technique, we know from the description of Muhammad al' Awfi just two hundred years later\\" The earliest Arabic reference to a compass, in the form of magnetic needle in a bowl of water, comes from a work by Baylak al-QibjƒÅqƒ´, written in 1282 while in Cairo.KitƒÅb Kanz al-tujjƒÅr fƒ´ ma ørifat al-a·∏•jƒÅr Al-QibjƒÅqƒ´ described a needle-and-bowl compass used for navigation on a voyage he took from Syria to Alexandria in 1242. Since the author describes having witnessed the use of a compass on a ship trip some forty years earlier, some scholars are inclined to antedate its first appearance in the Arab world accordingly.Kreutz, Barbara M. (1973) \\"Mediterranean Contributions to the Medieval Mariner's Compass\\", Technology and Culture, 14 (3: July), p. 367‚Äì383 Al-QibjƒÅqƒ´ also reports that sailors in the Indian Ocean used iron fish instead of needles. Late in the 13th century, the Yemeni Sultan and astronomer al-Malik al-Ashraf described the use of the compass as a \\"Qibla indicator\\" to find the direction to Mecca. In a treatise about astrolabes and sundials, al- Ashraf includes several paragraphs on the construction of a compass bowl (·π≠ƒÅsa). He then uses the compass to determine the north point, the meridian (kha·π≠·π≠ ni·π£f al-nahƒÅr), and the Qibla. This is the first mention of a compass in a medieval Islamic scientific text and its earliest known use as a Qibla indicator, although al-Ashraf did not claim to be the first to use it for this purpose. http://www.uib.no/jais/v001ht/01-081-132schmidl1.htm#_ftn4 (PDF version) In 1300, an Arabic treatise written by the Egyptian astronomer and muezzin Ibn Sim ø≈´n describes a dry compass used for determining qibla. Like Peregrinus' compass, however, Ibn Sim ø≈´n's compass did not feature a compass card. In the 14th century, the Syrian astronomer and timekeeper Ibn al-Shatir (1304‚Äì1375) invented a timekeeping device incorporating both a universal sundial and a magnetic compass. He invented it for the purpose of finding the times of prayers. Arab navigators also introduced the 32-point compass rose during this time. In 1399, an Egyptian reports two different kinds of magnetic compass. One instrument is a ‚Äúfish‚Äù made of willow wood or pumpkin, into which a magnetic needle is inserted and sealed with tar or wax to prevent the penetration of water. The other instrument is a dry compass. In the 15th century, the description given by Ibn Majid while aligning the compass with the pole star indicates that he was aware of magnetic declination. An explicit value for the declination is given by  øIzz al-Dƒ´n al-WafƒÅ æƒ´ (fl. 1450s in Cairo). Pre modern Arabic sources refer to the compass using the term ·π≠ƒÅsa (lit. \\"bowl\\") for the floating compass, or ƒÅlat al-qiblah (\\"qibla instrument\\") for a device used for orienting towards Mecca. Friedrich Hirth suggested that Arab and Persian traders, who learned about the polarity of the magnetic needle from the Chinese, applied the compass for navigation before the Chinese did. However, Needham described this theory as \\"erroneous\\" and \\"it originates because of a mistraslation\\" of the term chia-ling found in Zhu Yu's book Pingchow Table Talks.

Ogawa aimed to overtake Andrew Gilbert-Scott's car on the main straight, but the latter held his position while Ogawa moved slightly to the side. He clipped the rear left wheel and the front of his car became lodged in the rear bodywork. Both went down the straight at speed and went into the gravel trap, which was insufficient in slowing down either car. Gilbert-Scott spun, hit the tyre wall and flipped, landing upside-down. Ogawa went in nose- first, hit a mound in the gravel trap and was launched over the tyre barrier, hitting a high-fence supporting pole. Both cars were wrecked and the race was stopped immediately.

These are also known as Eicker‚ÄìHuber‚ÄìWhite standard errors (also Huber‚ÄìWhite standard errors or White standard errors), to recognize the contributions of Friedhelm Eicker, Peter J. Huber, and Halbert White. In regression and time-series modelling, basic forms of models make use of the assumption that the errors or disturbances ui have the same variance across all observation points. When this is not the case, the errors are said to be heteroscedastic, or to have heteroscedasticity, and this behaviour will be reflected in the residuals widehat{u}_i estimated from a fitted model. Heteroscedasticity-consistent standard errors are used to allow the fitting of a model that does contain heteroscedastic residuals. The first such approach was proposed by Huber (1967), and further improved procedures have been produced since for cross-sectional data, time-series data and GARCH estimation. Heteroscedasticity-consistent standard errors that differ from classical standard errors is an indicator of model misspecification. This misspecification is not fixed by merely replacing the classical with heteroscedasticity-consistent standard errors; for all but a few quantities of interest, the misspecification may lead to bias. In most situations, the problem should be found and fixed. Other types of standard error adjustments, such as clustered standard errors, may be considered as extensions to HC standard errors.  History  Heteroscedasticity-consistent standard errors are introduced by Friedhelm Eicker, and popularized in econometrics by Halbert White. Problem Assume that we are studying the linear regression model : Y = X beta + U, , where X is the vector of explanatory variables and Œ≤ is a k √ó 1 column vector of parameters to be estimated. The ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator is : widehat beta_text{OLS} = (mathbb{X}' mathbb{X})^{-1} mathbb{X}' mathbb{Y}. , where mathbb{X} denotes the matrix of stacked X_i' values observed in the data. If the sample errors have equal variance œÉ2 and are uncorrelated, then the least-squares estimate of Œ≤ is BLUE (best linear unbiased estimator), and its variance is easily estimated with : v_text{OLS}left[widehatbeta_text{OLS}right] = s^2 (mathbb{X}'mathbb{X})^{-1}, quad s^2 = frac{sum_i widehat u_i^2}{n-k} where widehat u_i = Y_i - X_i widehat beta_text{OLS} are the regression residuals. When the assumptions of operatorname E[uu'] = sigma^2 I_n are violated, the OLS estimator loses its desirable properties. Indeed, : Vleft[widehatbeta_text{OLS}right] = V[ (mathbb{X}'mathbb{X})^{-1} mathbb{X}'mathbb{Y}] = (mathbb{X}'mathbb{X})^{-1} mathbb{X}' Sigma mathbb{X} (mathbb{X}'mathbb{X})^{-1} where Sigma = V[u]. While the OLS point estimator remains unbiased, it is not \\"best\\" in the sense of having minimum mean square error, and the OLS variance estimator v_text{OLS} left[ widehatbeta_text{OLS} right] does not provide a consistent estimate of the variance of the OLS estimates. For any non-linear model (for instance logit and probit models), however, heteroscedasticity has more severe consequences: the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters will be biased (in an unknown direction), as well as inconsistent (unless the likelihood function is modified to correctly take into account the precise form of heteroscedasticity). As pointed out by Greene, ‚Äúsimply computing a robust covariance matrix for an otherwise inconsistent estimator does not give it redemption.‚Äù Solution If the regression errors u_i are independent, but have distinct variances œÉi2, then Sigma = operatorname{diag}(sigma_1^2, ldots, sigma_n^2) which can be estimated with widehatsigma_i^2 = widehat u_i^2. This provides White's (1980) estimator, often referred to as HCE (heteroscedasticity-consistent estimator): : begin{align} v_text{HCE} left[ widehatbeta_text{OLS} right] &= frac{1}{n} left(frac{1}{n} sum_i X_i X_i' right)^{-1} left(frac{1}{n} sum_i X_i X_i' widehat{u}_i^2 right) left(frac{1}{n} sum_i X_i X_i' right)^{-1}  &= ( mathbb{X}' mathbb{X} )^{-1} ( mathbb{X}' operatorname{diag}(widehat u_1^2, ldots, widehat u_n^2) mathbb{X} ) ( mathbb{X}' mathbb{X})^{-1}, end{align} where as above mathbb{X} denotes the matrix of stacked X_i' values from the data. The estimator can be derived in terms of the generalized method of moments (GMM). Note that also often discussed in the literature (including in White's paper itself) is the covariance matrix widehatOmega_n of the sqrt{n}-consistent limiting distribution: : sqrt{n}(widehatbeta_n - beta) , xrightarrow{d} , N(0,Omega), where : Omega = operatorname E[X X']^{-1} operatorname{Var}[X u]operatorname E[X X']^{-1}, and : begin{align} widehatOmega_n &= left(frac{1}{n} sum_i X_i X_i' right)^{-1} left(frac{1}{n} sum_i X_i X_i' widehat u_i^2 right) left(frac{1}{n} sum_i X_i X_i' right)^{-1}  &= n ( mathbb{X}' mathbb{X} )^{-1} ( mathbb{X}' operatorname{diag}(widehat u_1^2, ldots, widehat u_n^2) mathbb{X} ) ( mathbb{X}' mathbb{X})^{-1} end{align} Thus, : widehatOmega_n = n cdot v_text{HCE}[widehatbeta_text{OLS}] and : widehatoperatorname{Var}[X u] = frac{1}{n} sum_i X_i X_i' widehat u_i^2 = frac{1}{n} mathbb{X}' operatorname{diag}(widehat u_1^2, ldots, widehat u_n^2) mathbb{X}. Precisely which covariance matrix is of concern is a matter of context. Alternative estimators have been proposed in MacKinnon & White (1985) that correct for unequal variances of regression residuals due to different leverage. Unlike the asymptotic White's estimator, their estimators are unbiased when the data are homoscedastic.

Buckminster facilitates straightforward sharing of complex assemblies of software components. It is particularly useful for building and sharing virtual distros, distributions of software components which share components across multiple software projects and repositories. In February 2019 project was archived. Operation A Buckminster CQUERY (component query) names a component assembly. Using a CQUERY, Buckminster can find and locate all the components necessary to complete that particular configuration. Finding needed components includes transitively finding all the components needed by those components. The process which Buckminster implements to transitively locate and then download and install a full set of components for a particular CQUERY is called materialization. A CQUERY is typically published by a developer (or development team) to denote their work: those interested in accessing and using this software can ask Buckminster to fetch everything necessary by quoting the CQUERY. A Buckminster RMAP (resource map) is associated with a CQUERY, and lists one or more software repositories in which appropriate components can be found. Many popular repository formats are supported, including Concurrent Versions System, Subversion, Apache Maven, Perforce and Eclipse platform infrastructures. A Buckminster CSPEC (component specification) lists appropriate attributes of a component such as how to build it and on what other components it depends on. CSPECs are frequently automatically generated by Buckminster based on meta-information available elsewhere within repositories and the build environment. Automatically generated CSPECs can be manually via CSPECX CSPEC eXtensions\\". A Buckminster BOM (bill of materials) lists in full all the details necessary to fulfill a particular CQUERY, and is automatically generated by Buckminster.

It was originally introduced in 1983 by Mikhail Gromov, who used it to prove his systolic inequality for essential manifolds, vastly generalizing Loewner's torus inequality and Pu's inequality for the real projective plane, and creating systolic geometry in its modern form. The filling radius of a simple loop C in the plane is defined as the largest radius, R > 0, of a circle that fits inside C: :mathrm{FillRad}(Csubset mathbb{R}^2) = R. Dual definition via neighborhoods There is a kind of a dual point of view that allows one to generalize this notion in an extremely fruitful way, as shown by Gromov. Namely, we consider the varepsilon- neighborhoods of the loop C, denoted :U_varepsilon C subset mathbb{R}^2. As varepsilon>0 increases, the varepsilon-neighborhood U_varepsilon C swallows up more and more of the interior of the loop. The last point to be swallowed up is precisely the center of a largest inscribed circle. Therefore, we can reformulate the above definition by defining mathrm{FillRad}(Csubset mathbb{R}^2) to be the infimum of varepsilon > 0 such that the loop C contracts to a point in U_varepsilon C. Given a compact manifold X imbedded in, say, Euclidean space E, we could define the filling radius relative to the imbedding, by minimizing the size of the neighborhood U_varepsilon Xsubset E in which X could be homotoped to something smaller dimensional, e.g., to a lower-dimensional polyhedron. Technically it is more convenient to work with a homological definition. Homological definition Denote by A the coefficient ring mathbb{Z} or mathbb{Z}_2, depending on whether or not X is orientable. Then the fundamental class, denoted [X], of a compact n-dimensional manifold X, is a generator of the homology group H_n(X;A)simeq A, and we set : mathrm{FillRad}(Xsubset E) = inf left{ varepsilon > 0 mid iota_varepsilon([X])=0in H_n(U_varepsilon X) right}, where iota_varepsilon is the inclusion homomorphism. To define an absolute filling radius in a situation where X is equipped with a Riemannian metric g, Gromov proceeds as follows. One exploits Kuratowski embedding. One imbeds X in the Banach space L^infty(X) of bounded Borel functions on X, equipped with the sup norm cdot. Namely, we map a point xin X to the function f_xin L^infty(X) defined by the formula f_x(y) = d(x,y) for all yin X, where d is the distance function defined by the metric. By the triangle inequality we have d(x,y) =  f_x - f_y , and therefore the imbedding is strongly isometric, in the precise sense that internal distance and ambient distance coincide. Such a strongly isometric imbedding is impossible if the ambient space is a Hilbert space, even when X is the Riemannian circle (the distance between opposite points must be , not 2!). We then set E= L^infty(X) in the formula above, and define :mathrm{FillRad}(X)=mathrm{FillRad} left( Xsubset L^{infty}(X) right). Properties * The filling radius is at most a third of the diameter (Katz, 1983). * The filling radius of real projective space with a metric of constant curvature is a third of its Riemannian diameter, see (Katz, 1983). Equivalently, the filling radius is a sixth of the systole in these cases. * The filling radius of the Riemannian circle of length 2œÄ, i.e. the unit circle with the induced Riemannian distance function, equals œÄ/3, i.e. a sixth of its length. This follows by combining the diameter upper bound mentioned above with Gromov's lower bound in terms of the systole (Gromov, 1983) *The systole of an essential manifold M is at most six times its filling radius, see (Gromov, 1983). The inequality is optimal in the sense that the boundary case of equality is attained by the real projective spaces as above. * The injectivity radius of compact manifold gives a lower bound on filling radius. Namely, *:mathrm{FillRad} Mge frac{mathrm{InjRad} M}{2(dim M+2)}.

Bays The largest bodies of water in the Bay Area are the San Francisco Bay, San Pablo Bay, and Suisun Bay. The San Francisco Bay is one of the largest bays in the world. Many inlets on the edges of the three major bays are designated as bays in their own right, such as Richardson Bay, San Rafael Bay, Grizzly Bay, and San Leandro Bay. Nearby bays along the Pacific Coast include Bodega Bay, Tomales Bay, Drakes Bay, Bolinas Bay, and Half Moon Bay. Rivers The largest rivers are the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers, which drain into the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta and thence to Suisun Bay. Other major rivers of the North Bay are the Napa River, the Petaluma River, the Gualala River, and the Russian River; the former two drain into San Pablo Bay, the latter two into the Pacific Ocean. In the South Bay, the Guadalupe River drains into San Francisco Bay near Alviso. Creeks The Bay Area has a network of streams that are generally called creeks, but sometimes called arroyos, due to the Spanish language heritage evident in names such as Santa Rosa Creek and San Pablo Creek. Due to low rainfall in the summer months (May‚ÄìOctober), many Bay Area creeks are intermittent, flowing above ground only during part of the year. Political groups have been formed to preserve creeks or restore creeks which have been culverted for development. Baxter Creek in Contra Costa County has been daylighted in various points along its piped route by Friends of Baxter Creek. Other organizations include Friends of Five Creeks, which monitors, restores, cleans and educates in relation to creeks flowing from the Berkeley Hills to the Eastshore Estuary in the East Bay.Guide to San Francisco Bay Area Creeks Springs The Bay Area has springs which are the source of most of the minor creeks in the East Bay hills such as Garrity Creek. In the North Bay there are hot springs which serve as further tourist attractions to Wine Country tourists and spa goers. Lakes The Bay Area has many lakes, particularly if one includes artificial ones such as Lake Berryessa. Some are very small (such as Jewel Lake in Berkeley) and others are covered (Summit Reservoir, for example). Lake Merced and Lake Merritt are salt lakes; the former is drying up while the latter is a closed off estuarine cove. Aquifers Due to pollution of surface water, much of the area's potable water is located underground, for instance in the Mocho Subbasin of the Livermore Valley. As these aquifers get drawn down by pumping, there is increasing interest in ways to speed up the recharging of these resources. Wetlands Prior to the introduction of European agricultural methods, the shores of San Francisco Bay consisted mostly of tidal marshes. Approximately 85% of those marshes have been lost or destroyed, but about 50 marshes and marsh fragments remain. In the Delta area, marshes were drained for farmland. In San Francisco, marshes were filled in for urban development. In the East Bay, portions were used as landfill. In the South Bay, huge tracts have served as commercial salt evaporation ponds. In the North Bay, the Napa Sonoma Marsh and Point Molate Marsh remain productive ecosystems. Some wetlands have been restored or protected from further development. Success stories include Eastshore State Park and Crissy Field. Many native and recovered wetlands are preserved in the Don Edwards San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge and the San Pablo Bay National Wildlife Refuge. Wetlands also exist on the Pacific Coast (the Estero Americano, for instance) and in certain inland valleys: for example, the Laguna de Santa Rosa near Santa Rosa. Transportation The Bay Area is a large natural harbor. Around it have grown seaports and naval facilities. Active ports include the ports of Richmond, Redwood City, San Francisco, and Oakland. Ships also traverse the bay heading to and from ports in Stockton and Sacramento. During World War I and World War II the region was the United States's major shipbuilding center for the Pacific. Former naval facilities include Point Molate Naval Fuel Depot, Alameda Point Naval Facility and Mare Island Naval Shipyard. Many Bay Area cities have marinas, including Berkeley, Petaluma, and Redwood City. There is also an extensive commuter ferry system, which is being expanded by the San Francisco Bay Water Transit Authority. Oceanic harbors have been built at Bodega Bay and Half Moon Bay.

It has a population of approximately 2500 and is located in the Raikot tehsil of district Ludhiana. The nearest major city is Ludhiana which is at approximately 38 kilometers from Andlu. Andlu is well connected to Raikot, Ludhiana and Ahmedgarh by well laid network of roads. It has two schools; the primary school for children up to fifth grade and a Higher Secondary School for students up to Grade twelfth. It also has a health dispensary run by the Department of Health of Punjab, and has a MBBS doctor appointed to the dispensary. People of Andlu actively participate in sports, facilities for which are available in the large ground in the premises of the Higher secondary school. Popular games are football, cricket, Rope pulling, volleyball and cart racing.  Economy  The primary occupation of the people of Andlu, like majority of villages of Punjab, is agriculture. A significant population of Andlu consists of people of scheduled caste and backward class (OBC). As the economy grows, Andlu continues to grow and recently many new shops and eating joints, called Dhabhas, have sprung in the periphery of village. Also a gas station has opened in the village which is unusual for a small village like Andlu. The most common religion of people of Andlu is Sikh, followed by Hindus. In the past few decades, large number of families from this village have migrated to the western countries, mainly Canada, Australia, U.S.A. and U.K. And this trend continues to the present day as well as more and more youngsters choose to settle in western countries rather than continuing with the family occupation in the village. Most marriages currently solemnized in Andlu have at least one partner as foreign resident, and after marriage, the couple almost always choose to reside in the foreign country.  History  Andlu is mainly a village of migrants from Pakistan who came here at the time of independence and partition of India in year 1947. Majority of the population today is of Grewal jatts. Before independence the majority of the people living here were Muslims, but later some migrated to Pakistan (now living in sidhu pura, faisalabad city) and the majority were killed. Even today, some old abandoned Mosques, which were earlier the place of worship for Muslims, can be found in the village. Many decades ago, Andlu incorporated the neighboring village of Shahidgarh whose population was said to be totally wiped out by the Muslims hence the name of Shaheedgarh.

During the 1907 financial panic, Pringle wrote a criticism of the Canadian banking System. Another MP, banker Robert Bickerdike, took him to task, and put such pressure on him through negative articles in the media of the time that Pringle backed down. The next time the bank charters were renewed, instead of addressing the laxness of regulation that had led to the panic, several changes were made to suit the bankers.R.C.

The principal facade, to the right are the cupolas of the church of San Giorgio. To the left begins the staircase, leading further up the cliff to the exedra Villa Duodo, also known as the Villa Valier, is a villa situated at Monselice near Padua in the Veneto, northern Italy. It is attributed to the architect Vincenzo Scamozzi although some later parts are known to have been designed by Andrea Tirali.dal Lago. p 74 The villa was built for a Venetian patrician, Francesco Duodo, circa 1592.dal Lago, p 89 Villa Duodo photographed by Paolo Monti in 1967 (Fondo Paolo Monti, BEIC). Sited high on the rocca of Monselice, the villa, which shows Palladian influences, is not so much a villa as a religious complex. Two L-shaped blocks form a rectangular courtyard. Attached to the villa is a church dedicated to San Giorgio which is the final and largest church completing a \\"sacred route\\" of pilgrimage.  Architecture  Scamozzi, the villa's principal architect, had been a pupil of Palladio and was largely responsible for carrying Palladio's classicising style into the 17th century. His L'idea dell'architettura universale, published in 1615, coupled with Palladio's I quattro libri dell'architettura (1570) were to spread their classically based architecture throughout Europe and the New World.Trewin, p 253 Villa Duodo was one of Scamozzi's works of his intermediate period, designed when he was forty years old and fully competent in the use of perspective and proportion. The villa, which is built on the site of an ancient castle, is constructed of rendered stone with architectural details and motifs in dressed stone. The principal wing, on two floors, centers a lightly projecting bay that resembles a two-storey triumphal arch flanked by two symmetrical bays, each with open Serlian windows decorated with rusticated stone on the ground floor; above the motif continues, however, here in place of side windows are niches containing statuary. The complex was expanded by Nicol√≤ Duodo (1657‚Äì1742), the grandson of Francesco Duodo. His expansion included the secondary wing designed by Tirali, which was completed in 1740.The Castello di Monselice website gives the date of completion as 1740, this is probably an approximation as Tirali died in 1737 This wing, at right angles to the principal wing, is of a far simpler design, also on two floors; it has small rectangular windows relieved by a Serlian window at the centre. This wing is connected to the church by a low closed corridor. The chapel has a low dome crowned by a cupola and a campanile also completed by a cupola. The entrance to the church is through a three-arched portico. The pediment of the portico is in reality a gable to the roof of the church.  Grounds  The grounds contain a formal garden in the Renaissance manner and a massive late 17th century exedra, dedicated to St. Francis Xavier, who stayed at the former castle on the site in 1537.Castello di Monselice website The exedra contains at its centre an arched shrine containing a crucifix. The walls are decorated by empty niches while statuary adorns the crowning parapet. The exedra is reached by a monumental terrace staircase.  Santuario delle Sette Chiese  Situated close by, also commissioned by Duodo and designed by Scamozzi are six chapels collectively known as the Santuario delle Sette Chiese (\\"Sanctuary of the Seven Churches\\", sometimes \\"Jubilee Sanctuary of the Seven Churches\\"), the seventh church being the church of San Giorgio attached to the villa itself. This church holds the remains of the first Christian martyrs. The chapels became popular places of pilgrimage, when pope Paul V granted pilgrims visiting the sanctuary equal indulgences with those visiting the seven basilicas of Rome, after which the chapels are named. The chapels are positioned along a cobbled path - a votive route - which leads to the esplanade on which the villa and the final church stands. The chapels contain reredos by Palma il Giovane. The chapels are all similar in design, approximately six metres square, the front having an entrance contained in a segmented arch flanked by pilasters which support a pediment. The sides of the small buildings are pierced by lunette windows. The white rendered walls with decoration in natural dressed stone match the villa and church at the completion of the route. In appearance the churches are not unlike the many, and far more modern, small family mausoleums found in thousands of cemeteries in Italy and France, testimony to the influence of Scamozzi in everyday, and often seemingly unremarkable, architecture.  Modern history  The Villa is today often known as Villa Valier. The gardens and chapels are open to the public but the interior of the villa is private and part of the University of Padova.

John's elder brother was Alexander Hody (died 16 May 1461),The History of the Noble House of Stourton, of Stourton, in the County of Wilts By Ch. Botolph p. 206 a strong supporter of the House of Lancaster during the Wars of the Roses who was attainted in the first year of the reign of King Edward IV for his adherence to the deposed King Henry VI. Hody was descended from a family of considerable antiquity, though of no great note, in Devon. Jordan de Hode held lands in Hode in the thirteenth century; Richard de Hody was the king's escheator of that county in 1353/54 and 1357/58, and the same office was filled by William Hody in 1400/01. Career He was educated as a lawyer and is frequently mentioned in the Year Books from 1424/25. Although there is no record of his summons to take the degree of the coif, there is very little doubt that he was by 1435/36 a serjeant-at-law, as his name appears on the list of those called upon to contribute towards the equipment of the army against France in 1435/36. Certainly, he had attained that rank before July 1439. He was elected a Member of Parliament for Shaftesbury in 1421 and again in 1422, 1423, 1425 and 1427. In 1431 he was elected as a Member of Parliament for the prestigious county seat Dorset and in 1433, 1435 and 1437 for the county seat of Somerset. Clearly he was held in high esteem by the House of Commons which during his last tenure selected him to notify the House of Lords of the election of a new Speaker of the House of Commons in the place of John Tyrell, who was incapacitated by infirmity. On the death of Sir John Juyn in 1440 he was appointed Chief Justice of the King's Bench, by patent dated 13 April 1440, which office he held for almost two years, his successor, Sir John Fortescue, being appointed on 25 January 1442. His judicial career was probably terminated by his death, as his will is dated 17 December 1441, although the date of its probate is not recorded. Judicial reputation Notwithstanding the short period during which he presided in the court, he is stated by Prince (d. 1723)Prince, John, (1643‚Äì1723) The Worthies of Devon, 1810 edition, London to have won golden opinions by his integrity and firmness in the administration of justice. Sir Edward Coke mentions him amongst the \\"famous and expert sages of the law\\" from the decisions of whom Lyttelton had \\"great furtherance in composing his Institutes of the Laws of England.\\" Marriage and children He married Elizabeth Jewe (d. 1473), daughter and heiress of John Jewel (d. 1415/16)Woodger, History of Parliament of WhitfieldPole, Sir William (d. 1635), Collections Towards a Description of the County of Devon, Sir John-William de la Pole (ed.), London, 1791, p. 283 in the parish of Wiveliscombe in Somerset,Som.

The estuary region the forebay is located in is only 1m to 3m above mean sea level.  History  The body of water was created in 1969 by inundating a tract as part of the California State Water Project. It serves as the intake point of the California Aqueduct for transport to Southern California, and feeds the Delta‚ÄìMendota Canal (a part of the Central Valley Project) to recharge San Joaquin Valley river systems.The Atlantic.com: \\"The American Aqueduct and the Great California Water Saga\\", February 2014.  Geological context  If a large enough earthquake happens near or at the Clifton Court Forebay, the California water system for irrigation and municipal use will be adversely affected. Several earthquakes have nearly shut down the Forebay. The 2014 South Napa earthquake and the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake came very close to shutting down the Forebay intake system. The Clifton Forebay is a wetland system that drained nearby small rivers into the Pacific Ocean. Only in recent times was its freshwater drainage functions turned into a gateway to water storage. The Central Valley region that this forebay interfaces with is very gradually filling in the central valley with sediments. The region may be rebounding from recent run ins with glaciations that affected North America.  In popular culture  A documentary about the decline of the United States' infrastructure, The Crumbling of America, was commissioned by the U.S. A&E; network in the late 2000s. The documentary is typically shown on the History television channel in the United States, although other educational broadcasters globally have shown it. It features the Clifton Court Forebay as a \\"strategic piece of California freshwater infrastructure\\" subject to shutdown for up to two years if struck by an earthquake of magnitude 7.5 or greater.

It was adapted from the short story of the same name by crime writer Agatha Christie which had first appeared in the Daily Mail on 20 November 1928 and first appeared in book form in the US collection Double Sin and Other Stories in 1961. It first appeared in a UK collection in Poirot's Early Cases in 1974. The play is unique in that it is the only instance of Christie adapting one of her works for television, a medium she later came to dislike.Morgan, Janet. Agatha Christie, A Biography. (Page 347) Collins, 1984 It was broadcast live from Alexandra Palace as part of the programme Theatre Parade. The broadcast took place at 3.35 pm and lasted for twenty-five minutes. It was then repeated the same evening at 9.40 pm and lasted for twenty minutes. Theatre Parade usually showcased successful stage shows of the time but in this instance presented an original work. The play was only broadcast in the London area as this was the only part of the UK that could receive television transmissions at this time. Neither transmissions were recorded for future viewing as television recording equipment had not been invented at this point in time. The play is notable for starring Francis L.

As a result of emigration from Europe, these surnames are now also common throughout the United States, Canada and Australia. The German variants, which were likely spelled Sch√§rf or Schaerf originally, usually trace their origins to Bavaria, although the surname is now common over all of Germany. Literally meaning \\"sharp\\", it is regarded as having originated as a medieval nickname (or ekename), i.e. it described an attribute of an individual's personality, such as \\"sharp-wittedness\\".Scharf Family Crest, The Yiddish spelling Sharf, as well as the other variants, are found among Ashkenazi Jews. In Ireland, Scharf and related surnames, such as Scariff, were originally found in the south-western counties of Kerry and Limerick. They are now also common in counties Kilkenny and Carlow., , In Ireland, there are several different folk etymologies of the surname. One claims that it is indigenous to Ireland, although no Old Irish personal names closely resembling it have been identified. A second theory of the surname's origins holds that it came to Ireland with the Norse-speaking vikings that invaded and settled in Ireland, becoming known as the Norse Gaels. Following he viking invasions of Ireland in the 10th century, many vikings and their descendants were gaelicized. According to this theory, one or more vikings carried the name \\"Skarf\\", literally \\"cormorant\\", but also in a vernacular sense \\"glutton\\", \\"scoundrel\\" or \\"rascal\\". After Oliver Cromwell invaded and reconquered Ireland, prejudicial laws were enacted by the British. The Statues of Kilkenny banned the use of the Irish language (including personal names) in most of Leinster. Many indigenous Irish, anglicized their names to sound even more English. Hence, through complex and varying degrees of gaelicization and anglicization, a name such as Skarf may have become various names in different parts of Ireland, including Scarf, Scarffe, Scarriff and Scharf.

A spin bowler who predominantly bowls googlies and a right-handed batsman, Tahir currently plays for South Africa in Twenty20 International matches. On 15 June 2016, Tahir became the first South African bowler to take seven wickets in an ODI, and also the fastest South African to reach 100 ODI wickets (58 matches). On 17 February 2017, Tahir became the fastest South African to reach 50 T20I wickets. On 4 March 2017, against New Zealand he recorded the most economical figures by a South African spinner in an ODI, with 2 wickets for 14 runs from 10 overs. On 3 October 2018, he became the fourth bowler for South Africa to take a hat-trick in ODIs. In March 2019, he announced that he would quit ODI cricket following the 2019 Cricket World Cup. He represented his eighth English county club, when he joined Surrey in 2019, thus setting a new record. He is widely famous for his running celebration after every wicket he takes, known as The Marathon. Personal life Imran Tahir was born in Lahore, Pakistan, and learnt the game while growing up there. Being the eldest sibling, he started working at the age of 16 as a retail salesman at Lahore's Pace Shopping Mall on a meagre salary, to support his family. His fortunes changed when he was selected during trials to represent the Pakistan U-19 cricket team, eventually progressing onto the Pakistan A side on some tours. However, he failed to make the transition to the next stage. He began playing county cricket in England but did not stay there for long. He then moved to South Africa, which faced a perennial dearth of quality spinners. In South Africa, he played domestic cricket for five years and lived \\"hand-to-mouth for the first two years.\\" Domestic and T20 career As well as his first-class career in Pakistan, Tahir has had short spells with Yorkshire and Middlesex in county cricket as well as playing for Staffordshire in the Minor Counties Cricket Championship. While Tahir has represented Pakistan Under-19 cricket team's and Pakistan A, he failed to win full international honours for Pakistan. In 2005, aged 26, Tahir became a resident of South Africa. He is married to Sumayya Dildar, a South African woman, and has represented South Africa after becoming eligible to play for them when he met his four-year residence requirement in April 2009. Tahir was a member of Hampshire's 2009 Friends Provident Trophy winning squad, taking 2/50 from 10 overs in the final against Sussex. Tahir made his career high score of 77 not out in a County Championship match against Somerset on 28 August 2009. For the 2010 season Hampshire signed Sri Lankan spinner Ajantha Mendis, replacing Tahir for the season. Tahir represented Warwickshire for the 2010 season, and then represented Hampshire again until 2014. Tahir made his 100th first-class appearance in the 2009/2010 SuperSport Series when the Titans played the Lions. On 8 January Tahir was called up to the South Africa squad in their Test series against England although he was then withdrawn one day later after Cricket South Africa revealed that he was not eligible to play. At the end of the 2009/10 season, Tahir moved from the Titans to the Dolphins. This was due to a lack of first-class cricket with the club, who preferred to play 23-year-old leg-spinner Shaun von Berg. When Tahir was called into South Africa's squad for the final Test against England, national coach Mickey Arthur said \\"I'm not entirely sure what the issues are between him and the Titans, but the Titans obviously aren't going to pick him because they'd rather pick the young leggie they have\\". He holds the record for representing highest number of teams (27) in the world. He moved to the Highveld Lions in 2012. In January 2018, he was bought by the Chennai Super Kings in the 2018 IPL auction. In October 2018, he was named in Nelson Mandela Bay Giants' squad for the first edition of the Mzansi Super League T20 tournament. In July 2019, he was selected to play for the Amsterdam Knights in the inaugural edition of the Euro T20 Slam cricket tournament. However, the following month the tournament was cancelled. In September 2019, he was named in the squad for the Nelson Mandela Bay Giants team for the 2019 Mzansi Super League tournament. In July 2020, he was named in the Guyana Amazon Warriors squad for the 2020 Caribbean Premier League. International career Tahir was first called up to the South African Test team in 2010 when England were touring, but it was an error by the selection committee as he would not eligible to play for South Africa until January 2011. He was quickly withdrawn from the team then, but found his way back almost immediately after becoming eligible to play. Tahir qualified for South Africa on 1 January 2011, and was selected by them for the 2011 Cricket World Cup. Although he was part of South Africa's squad to play a five-match ODI series against India before the World Cup, Tahir did not make his debut. Captain Graeme Smith explained that this was because \\"[Tahir] is someone we want to keep fresh and we didn't want to give people the opportunity to see too much of him.\\" Imran Tahir debuted for South Africa in a match against the West Indies on 24 February 2011 at the Feroz Shah Kotla stadium in Delhi. He took 4 wickets for 41 runs in 10 overs during his debut match. He impressed immediately, picking 14 wickets in the five games he played. He made his Test debut against Australia at Cape Town in November 2011 and was a regular part of the squad for four years. In the Test series against Pakistan in UAE in 2013, he was not picked for the first Test, but he came back strongly in the second by bagging a five-wicket haul on the first day of the Test match. Tahir was left out once again after one bad Test with the ball against India and was replaced by Robin Peterson, but he continued to do well in the shorter forms of the game. He continued to be a regular member of the South African side in all formats and played Test matches in spin-friendly conditions. In November 2012 Tahir bowled 37 overs in a Test match against Australia, with no wickets for 260 runs ‚Äì the worst bowling figures in Test match history. After the Test, he was dropped and replaced by Robin Peterson. In October 2013, Tahir made a comeback to Test cricket when he took 5 wickets in an innings for the first time in a Test match and guided South Africa to clinch victory against Pakistan by an innings and 92 runs in the Dubai Test, levelling the series 1‚Äì1. He took 8 wickets in the match. At the 2014 ICC World Twenty20, Tahir returned his best figures, of 4‚Äì21, in South Africa's match against the Netherlands on 27 March 2014, and was awarded Man of the match. Tahir was joint highest wicket-taker in the tournament along with Ahsan Malik from the Netherlands; both took 12 wickets in the tournament. In the 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup quarter-final match between South Africa and Sri Lanka, Tahir helped South Africa to their first ever World Cup knockout win with a Man of the Match performance of 4-26. At the end of 2015 he was named in the ICC ODI team of the year. In February 2017 he reached the top position in both the ODI and T20I rankings for bowlers, and three months later was named T20I Cricketer of the Year at Cricket South Africa's annual awards. In August 2017, he was named in a World XI side to play three Twenty20 International matches against Pakistan in the 2017 Independence Cup in Lahore. =2019 Cricket World Cup= In April 2019, he was named in South Africa's squad for the 2019 Cricket World Cup. He played in the opening match of the tournament, against hosts England. At the age of 40 years and 64 days, Tahir became the oldest cricketer for South Africa to play in a World Cup match. He bowled the opening over of the tournament, therefore becoming the first spinner to bowl the first over in a World Cup match. Tahir also took the first wicket of the World Cup, dismissing England's Jonny Bairstow for a duck. In South Africa's next match in the World Cup, against Bangladesh, Tahir played in his 100th ODI.

History The community was founded in 1893 as Dogtown, which was derived from the name Dog Lake (\\"skaha\\" means \\"dog\\" in the Okanagan language). The current name derives from a small set of the falls that used to lie on the Okanagan River at the outlet of Skaha Lake. The falls have since been submerged beneath the lake due to the construction of a dam on the river. In 2012, Okanagan Falls expressed interest in incorporating as a municipality.  Geological features  The namesake Okanagan Falls have long been submerged by the waters of Skaha Lake, which rose as a result of the construction of this small dam. The dam is located just south of the bridge along Highway 97 The dam is a vital component of the flood and irrigation controls of the region. Nestled at the head of a giant spillway formed as the discharge of Glacial Lake Penticton was constrained between Mount McLellan to the west and Peach Cliff to the east. Okanagan Falls has a diverse assemblage of geological attractions. = Peach Cliff = Peach Cliff is a dominant landmark to the east of Okanagan Falls. It consists of trachyte of Eocene age. Peach Cliff is home to herds of mule deer and a sizeable herd of California bighorn sheep. Perched high on a spur of Peach Cliff is Balancing Rock, a large glacial erratic supported by a couple of granitic cobbles. = Indian Head = Southwest of Okanagan Falls, are the ragged cliffs of Indian Head, one of the most unusual rock formations in the Okanagan. Consisting of dark volcanic rocks overlying a lighter conglomerate. This formation contains spectacular megabreccia, volcanic and plutonic rocks up to across and metamorphic rocks of up to across. = Mahoney Lake = South of Okanagan Falls lies meromictic Mahoney Lake, home to spectacular blooms of purple sulphur bacteria. This purple is contrasted by nearby Green Lake, which is coloured by the precipitation of calcium carbonates in the water column.  Tourism  The Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory is a research facility founded in 1960 and located southwest of Okanagan Falls and Penticton. The site houses three instruments - an interferometric radio telescope, a single- dish antenna, and a solar flux monitor - and supports engineering laboratories. The DRAO is operated by the Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics of the National Research Council of the Canadian government. The observatory was named an IEEE Milestone for first radio astronomical observations using VLBI. There is a self-guided tour available at the facility during daylight hours.

Its mission is 'To promote the sustainable supply and use of energy for the greatest benefit of all people'. The idea for the foundation of the Council came from Daniel Nicol Dunlop in the 1920s. He wanted to gather experts from all around the world to discuss current and future energy issues. He organised in 1923 first national committees, which organised the first World Power Conference (WPC) in 1924. 1,700 experts from 40 countries met in London to discuss energy issues. The meeting was a success and the participants decided on July 11, 1924 to establish a permanent organisation named World Power Conference. Dunlop was elected as its first Secretary General. In 1968 the name was changed to World Energy Conference, and in 1989 it became the World Energy Council.Wright, Rebecca; Shin, Hiroki; Trentmann, Frank (2013).

It is an anti-romantic comedy filmed in mockumentary style. The movie attracted media attention for the fact that it was largely funded by web donations. Plot Futile Attraction is about the filming of a reality dating show in which the main characters are so incompatible that the film crew have to manipulate and lie to them in order to keep them together. Randal (Peter Rutherford) is a telemarketer with a passion for telephones who has never quite broken away from his controlling mother; Germaine (Danielle Mason) is an activist who agrees to be filmed in order to publicise the threat a new dam poses to her favourite stream. During the filming, presenter Dudley (Alistair Browning), who is willing to do anything to get himself looking good on camera, clashes with Anne (Glenda Tuaine), who prefers to ignore their boss's ever-changing scripting instructions in preference to a more objective look at the reality of the relationship. Production With limited resources available, the writers chose the mockumentary format for its combination of low budget requirements and comedic possibilities. The movie was filmed in 2002 over 13 days, however due to technical problems post-production took two- and-a-half years. The vital fundraising also took time. Having been rejected for funding by the New Zealand Film Commission, Prebble set up a website to raise money internationally. In addition to the money raised in this way, he received numerous offers in kind, from professional advice to poster design and band music.

The local economy is supported by logging, tourism and transportation industries. Geography Blue River lies in a wide, gravelly part of the North Thompson River valley. Its podzolic soils are strongly acidic and coarse, with abundant sand, gravel and stones. Drainage is not as rapid as would be expected from the soils' coarse texture because the subsoils tend to be cemented. The forests and mountains around Blue River have plentiful big game such as deer, moose, black bear, grizzly bear, and caribou. Birds include osprey, eagle, woodpecker and raven. The mountain pine beetle has become the area's most significant insect. Lodgepole pine is the most common tree at Blue River, although its population has been severely reduced by the mountain pine beetle. Other common native conifers are Douglas-fir, Engelmann spruce, subalpine fir, western hemlock and western red cedar. Among deciduous trees, the black cottonwood is largest; trembling aspen and paper birch are also prominent. Non-native trees which may be seen in Blue River include green ash, littleleaf linden, silver maple, and Norway maple. Sugar maple, burr oak, northern red oak and butternut formerly thrived at the CNR Gardens. =Climate= Blue River has a continental climate which is subject to frequent modification by maritime air masses from the Pacific Ocean. The area is part of the world's only interior temperate rainforest that occupies parts of eastern British Columbia. Heavy and deep snow falls most winters. The most severe cold spells may send thermometer readings below -40 ¬∞C/F. Rain is frequent in other seasons.

The creek passes through Hilltop Green, under Interstate 80 via pipes, down a small canyon alongside Hilltop Plaza Shopping Center, and then through culverts to a gorge where it has been dammed to create Hilltop Lake. At that point the creek appears as a small lake, surrounded by Hilltop Lake Park. The creek then continues through undeveloped land to its mouth at the shoreline of San Pablo Bay.

Pulse width modulation (PWM) and maximum power point tracker (MPPT) technologies are more electronically sophisticated, adjusting charging rates depending on the battery's level, to allow charging closer to its maximum capacity. A charge controller with MPPT capability frees the system designer from closely matching available PV voltage to battery voltage. Considerable efficiency gains can be achieved, particularly when the PV array is located at some distance from the battery. By way of example, a 150 volt PV array connected to an MPPT charge controller can be used to charge a 24 or 48 volt battery. Higher array voltage means lower array current, so the savings in wiring costs can more than pay for the controller. Charge controllers may also monitor battery temperature to prevent overheating. Some charge controller systems also display data, transmit data to remote displays, and data logging to track electric flow over time.

It was originally performed at INTAR, 420 West End Street in New York City on January 18, 1984. The play tells the story of the fiery-tempered Sarita Fernandez, who is gradually torn apart by her sexual desires and moral values to the point of insanity. Plot summary Preamble: Sarita Is Fit. The play begins with Sarita as a 13-year- old schoolgirl living in New York City in 1939, sitting with her friend Yeye in her apartment, telling fortunes. Sarita is flustered because she saw her crush, Julio, getting aroused while talking to a different girl. Yeye assures Sarita that he was really thinking of her when he got aroused, but Sarita vows that she will date many boys just like Julio. In the next scene, Sarita, now 14 years old, tells her mother, Fela, that she is pregnant. Fela at first thinks her tenant, Fernando (an older man), has raped Sarita, but Sarita confessed that she'd been seeing many men and boys and she doesn't know who gave her the baby. Fela tries to solve the problem by trying to get Sarita to marry Fernando so her child will be 'legal.' Both Fernando and Sarita refuse, Sarita because she still wants to go to school, and Fernando because Sarita is a \\"rude brat.\\" Although we don't ever see a pregnancy develop or a child throughout the play, Sarita does give birth to a son, Melo, whom she leaves in her mother's care. After giving birth, Sarita runs away from home, promising that she'll send money to her son Melo. Later, we see that Sarita and Julio have become lovers, although Julio constantly 'leaves' Sarita, which frustrated her as she gets older. Sarita attempts to write several goodbye letters over the years, but she always ends up forgiving Julio. One night, she finally finishes a good-bye letter and goes to the Empire State Building to commit suicide. But a young soldier named Mark stops her and falls in love with her. For most of the second act, Sarita struggles internally with her love for her new husband, Mark, and her lingering passion and desire for Julio. One night, after Sarita and Julio have sex, Julio begins harassing Sarita, and tells her that if she wants to keep the affair hidden from Mark, she needs to pay him. Sarita, insane with anger, frustration, and rage, stabs Julio fatally and instantly regrets it. Julio dies in her arms. The final scene takes place in a mental hospital in which Sarita is a patient. Sarita talks with Fernando, and when Mark comes to see her, despite all that she has done against him, she realizes that she belonged with Mark all along. The pair clasps hands as Sarita inquires fearfully about her future and \\"what they will do\\" to her in the asylum. Theme: Love vs. Lust The three main male characters, Julio, Mark, and Fernando each represent a potential path for Sarita's affections and love. Sarita is in a constant struggle between love and lust, love winning out in the end. Julio represents lust, which, while appealing and desirable, cannot satisfy Sarita completely. Mark, representing true loser characteristics, is willing to stand by Sarita come what may (as demonstrated by the finale scene in the mental asylum). Fernando, on the other hand, represents necessity, as seen when Fela wants him to marry Sarita (despite the enormous age difference) so Sarita's child can have a father.

Character history A sinister and powerful attorney, Gregory seemed to have what he wanted: a perfect job, a perfect family. But his ex-wife, Olivia was cheating on him with his best friend, Del Douglas and was almost always drunk. His kids, Caitlin and Sean, fell in love with people that Gregory hated. While doing everything in his best interest, Gregory did his best to scare or kill his daughter's boyfriend, Cole Deschanel and remove his son's runaway girlfriend, Tiffany. Although Gregory couldn't convince his kids to leave their loved ones, Gregory was happy when his wife got pregnant. Things were great, but he didn't know that Olivia didn't know who was the father of the baby. When his daughter miscarried during a car accident, she asked Annie Douglas Richards to help her find a baby, and Annie plotted to take away Olivia's child and present it as Caitlin's. Gregory was hurt when Olivia told him that their baby was born dead and their marriage was over. Then, during the summer of 1998, Annie plotted her way to Gregory and they tied the knot on the day that Annie could have lost her father's money. Of course, Annie and Gregory's marriage was everything but perfect. Annie was always plotting to get what she wanted and Gregory had other concerns. He never stopped trying to remove Cole from his daughter's life. His son had already forgotten about his father because he never did anything for him. Gregory and the rest of the family was shocked when the truth about Trey's real mother and Olivia's affair was discovered. At the beginning of 1999, Francesca Vargas was murdered and half of the citizens were suspected of the crime. But it was actually Gregory who killed Francesca. After having a huge fight with Cole, Gregory fell into the ocean and was never found. However, he came onto shore a day later and decided to play with the minds of his loved ones. He pretended to be Tobias Richards, Gregory's relative and messed with everyone's minds. He was eventually caught by Jude Cavanaugh (Annie Douglas's love interest) and he is sent to prison for Franchesca's murder as Gregory's reign of terror at Sunset Beach is finally over.

It is affiliated to the International Socialist Alternative. The organisation publishes a newspaper of the same name. History From the early 1990s to 2009, a single CWI section called Socialist Resistance (–°–æ—Ü–∏–∞–ª–∏—Å—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–µ –°–æ–ø—Ä–æ—Ç–∏–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ, Sotsialisticheskoye Soprotivleniye), existed in the countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States. In 2005 a group of members left to form VPERED. In 2009 a further split occurred due to differing positions on the recent Russo-Georgian War, with about half the Russian membership supporting Russian military intervention in South Ossetia and therefore leaving the CWI in disagreement.Russia/Georgia War, capitalist crisis and the workers‚Äô movement‚Ä¶, www.socialistworld.net, 27 November 2009. Those who left continued to use the Socialist Resistance name in Russia, while the CWI members in the CIS reorganised into the new Russian section, simply known as Russian Section of the CWI, and Socialist Resistance of Kazakhstan. In 2015, a faction within the organisation split off to form a new group called Marxistskaya Gruppa 21. The Russian CWI section renamed itself Sotsialisticheskaya Alternativa early in 2016. LGBT rights campaigning CWI members have been at the forefront of LGBT rights campaigns in Russia. In 2002, member and gay rights activist Sergei Kozlovskii was sued by Tamara Dadianova for the huge sum of 50,000 rubles in a court in Yaroslavl, after he had spoken of how she and her friends had verbally abused him over his sexuality and tried to force him out of a poetry venue.Show trial in Yaroslavi, www.socialistworld.net, 28 September 2002.Socialist and gay rights activist faces political repression and huge legal fine, www.socialistworld.net, 24 September 2002. Members have also participated in Moscow pride activities, arguing for radical campaigning to fight for LGBT rights. They organised a picket outside the Mayor of Moscow's office after the 2006 pride march was banned.Police and fascists attack Moscow Pride, www.socialistworld.net, 1 July 2006.

It is based on her 1938 novel of the same name.  Background  Christie is silent on the writing of both the book and the play in her autobiography. Her biography states that she started writing the play in a burst of enthusiasm after being involved in the preparations for Murder on the Nile which was being presented by her actor friend Francis L. Sullivan. The writing was completed by March 1944 and preparations were made towards the end of the year for an opening in Glasgow before transferring to the West End theatre. Christie wrote to her agent, Edmund Cork, the month before that \\"it really seems quite impossible that the play can be ready for Glasgow!\\"Morgan, Janet. Agatha Christie, A Biography. (Page 251) Collins, 1984 Nevertheless, the play did open there at the King's Theatre on 29 January 1945The Scotsman 30 January 1945 (Page 6) and then opened in the West End on 31 March 1945 at the Piccadilly Theatre. The play was not well received by the critics although box office receipts at the start were better than those for And Then There Were None eighteen months earlier. The play was directed by Terence de Marney who had played Philip Lombard in And Then There Were None. The play closed on 5 May after just 42 performances. The original West End production is most notable for the appearance of Joan Hickson in the role of Miss Pryce. Christie was so taken with her performance that she wrote to Hickson and stated that she hoped she would one day play the character of Miss Marple.Haining, Peter. Agatha Christie ‚Äì Murder in Four Acts (Page 140). 1990. Virgin Books. Hickson was later cast in this role in 1984 in the BBC television series. The adaptation of the book is notable for being one of the most radical reworkings of a novel Christie ever did, not only eliminating Hercule Poirot from the story, but changing the identity of the killer. In the play, the ill Mrs Boynton commits suicide and drops several red herrings that pointed to her family members as possible suspects, hoping that they would suspect each other and therefore continue to live in her shadow even after her death, whereas in the novel Lady Westholme is the murderess. In the play, Lady Westholme becomes a purely comic character.  Synopsis of Scenes  The time ‚Äì the present. ACT I *The lounge of the King Solomon Hotel, Jerusalem.

The plants that provide Ashanti pepper are vines that can grow up to 20 m in length, climbing up boles of trees by means of adventitious roots. These are native to topical regions of Central and Western Africa and are semi-cultivated in countries such as Nigeria where the leaves, known as uziza, are used as a flavouring for stews. Like other members of the pepper family, Ashanti pepper contains 5‚Äì8% of the chemical piperine which gives them their piquant taste. They contain large amounts of beta- caryophyllene, which is being investigated as an anti-inflammatory agent. It also contains significant proportions (up to around 10%) of myristicin, elemicin, safrole, and dillapiol, as well as some apiole (around 1.4%). In terms of flavour, Ashanti pepper is very similar to cubeb pepper but is less bitter and has a fresher, more herbaceous flavour and aroma than cubeb's more pine-like scent. Though known in Europe during the Middle Ages (it was a common spice in Rouen and Dieppe in 14th-century France), these days, its use is largely marginalized to West and Central Africa. Use in cuisine Samples of \\"Piper clusii\\" imported into Belgium from the Congo in 1895. It is used in West African cuisine where it imparts spiciness and a pungent aroma to stews. Even in West Africa, Ashanti pepper is an expensive spice and is used sparingly. Often, a few grains are ground in a pestle and mortar before being added (along with black pepper) to soups or to boiled rice. The spice can also be substituted in any recipe calling for cubeb pepper, where Ashanti imparts a less bitter flavour. The pepper is also sometimes one of the ingredients in the Berbere spice mix used in the cuisines of Ethiopia and of Eritrea. However, West African Pepper is a highly esteemed spice in its region of origin and may be hard to get abroad; thus, long pepper is more often used in Berbere. As a preservative Research shows that Ashanti peppers have preservative and anti-oxidant properties. In a comparison study of three native West African peppers on the preservation of catfish, Ashanti peppers were discovered to be the most effective.

He returned to play his character in the final episode as a part of Meg's dream. Character history Tim's Kansas backstory was vague and seemed to be altered at times for storyline purposes. In a background check performed by Gregory Richards, it was revealed that he was a college athlete involved in many activities. However, later episodes in the 500's and 600's allude to him being \\"not smart\\" and having little ambition. After the Ben/Meg cave-in, Meg talked about Tim's mother \\"making him carry a handkerchief to school everyday\\"‚Äîwhich seemed to indicate a well-mannered upbringing. However, in the mid-400 range of episodes, his family was described as \\"alcoholics\\" who neglected and abused him, and the Cummings were the \\"closest thing to a family he ever had\\". A more consistent element of his backstory was a lifelong devotion to Meg, \\"since kindergarten\\". In much of 1997-98, he was portrayed as having redeeming qualities. As the show progressed, he became more of a one-note, intolerable character that few people wanted anything to do with. In episode 1, Meg Cummings was about to marry Tim, but it was clear she was having second thoughts due to her involvement with SB on the internet. Her mother Joan seemed to support the idea that Meg was settling for an easy, predictable life. In the church, Meg found Tim making out with her best friend, Connie. Meg escaped to \\"Sunset Beach\\" to find SB. Tim, who decided to continue fighting for Meg, followed her to \\"Sunset Beach\\", where he desperately tried to win her over by helping Annie Douglas to break off Meg and Ben, a new couple. However, eventually, their plan failed. Tim and Annie developed feelings for one another, but it was unclear whether or not it went beyond physical attraction for Tim. By the end of the Kansas debacle in the late 100 episodes, Annie seemed to be quietly smitten, but Tim's inability to let go of Meg prevented any further relationship. Tim worked as a chauffeur for the Richards family, with a covert assignment to spy on Gregory's children. Gregory described him as \\"someone who knows how to keep his mouth shut\\" (episode 30). In episode 35, Caitlin Richards seduced Tim in the back of the limo in an attempt to lose her virginity. At first, Tim refused, but succumbed to Caitlin's advances, which she then revoked when she realized she was still in love with Cole. Before Tim's return to Kansas, he and Caitlin shared a playful kiss that Cole reacted to with jealousy. He realized that Tim was the man Caitlin \\"almost made love to\\" and told Caitlin: \\"A guy like that doesn't know how to be just friends\\". At the end of 1997, Tim was one of the survivors of the Terror Island storyline. When under the influence of the drug-laced soup, Tim's worst fear was Meg's face covered in blood. When Mark Wolper, one of the series regulars, was killed off by Derek Evans, Ben Evans' evil twin, Tim was the one who heard Mark's final words; \\"It was Ben\\". However, nobody believed him. Tim left Derek with the only telltale sign that distinguished him from his twin‚Äîa knife scar on his calf, which Derek covered with prosthetic skin. Some weeks later, Tim wanted to prove that Ben was the killer and eventually followed him (Derek, thinking it was Ben) to his warehouse after Caitlin and Cole's wedding. Derek caught him and said that he has made a big mistake and he is going to pay for this. He came after Tim with a lead pipe and the two began to fight. Tim tried to get away and find Meg to tell her that he was right about \\"Ben\\" being the killer on the island but Derek caught him again and they ended in a fight on the scaffolding of the Liberty Corporation's resort construction. Derek pushed Tim of the scaffolding. Tim survived the fall, but was severely injured‚Äînotably with a broken jaw that prevented him from speaking. Derek (appearing to be an Evil Ben at the time) snuck into his room at South Bay and smothered him with a pillow, bringing about a coma. Tim was in coma for a long time, and moved to Cedar Oaks. Dax Griffin reported; \\"I thought after I stirred up a little trouble in Sunset Beach, it might be the end of my character right off the bat. And I was worried when I was in a coma for a month. But the producers reassured me everything would be fine.\\" (SOD magazine, \\"Dax-terity\\", 6/9/98) It was later discovered Derek was behind the entire thing. In the summer of 1998, when Tim realized that Ben was innocent, he confided in Sara; \\"Deep down, I guess I never thought I was good enough for Meg. It's almost like I had to prove that. To myself. Meg. Everyone\\". (episode 371) When Tim was recovering in the Cedar Oaks facility, a mysterious amnesia patient began to accost him in his room. Her name was Dana and she had no memory of her past‚Äîbut Tim slowly realized it was the presumed-dead Maria Torres Evans. When Meg and Ben were meant to finally tie the knot, Tim plotted with Annie to reveal Ben's ex-wife with great fanfare and ruin the wedding. This ended up going even better than they'd planned‚ÄîMaria walked into the reception and caught Meg's bouquet, shocking everyone. This wasn't without consequence‚ÄîGregory fired Tim as a result of his scheming. From time to time, Tim comforted Meg, but she never fell for him again. They shared a brief kiss in episode 161‚Äîwhen Meg was trying to forget the pain of the cave-in incident - during which Tim persuaded her to \\"go ahead and use me, Meg\\". They kissed again upon their return to Kansas, but Meg was distressed by his assumption that they were getting back together. In 1998-1999, Tim tried to manipulate Sara Cummings's insecurities about Casey in order to break up Ben and Meg once again. He taunted her with the notion that Casey was going to leave her for Meg if Sara didn't help reunite Meg and Tim. When Sara agreed to \\"sell her soul to the devil\\", (episode 513) she helped Tim hatch a plan to get him alone with Meg in Palm Springs while Ben was with Maria. When this plan backfired, Tim repeatedly blackmailed Sara, threatening to go to Casey with everything. He used Sara to get a job as a busboy at the Shockwave, to prevent losing ties to the Cummings family. In 1999, Tim romanced Tess Marin, a person who came to Sunset Beach with Benjy Evans, Ben's and Maria's son. Tim's intention at first was to pump the nanny for information about the Ben/Meg/Maria battle, but he grew to like Tess genuinely. As a result, in episode 588, Tim stood up to Meg and declared he was over her for the first time. Tim blindly believed everything that Tess said, but things were much different than he thought. She claimed that she had a promissory note from Maria - a million dollars in exchange for breaking up Ben and Meg. Tess used sex and the looming possibility of the money to make Tim do her bidding. Tess was actually working with Derek Evans, who turned out to be alive. Benjy was actually Tess' son. While trying to warn Meg about Derek's return, Tim was killed. Derek strangled him in the Surf Central living room on October 30, and Tim returned a few episodes later to taunt Tess, who was feeling guilty for his murder. Tim eventually left Tess alone on November 15. In the very last episode, Meg had a dream and Tim was involved in it too. Dax Griffin, the character portrayer, agreed to return as a part of her fantasy.

It is a member of the Fiji Trades Union Congress,Neelesh Gounder, \\"A Long Road to Unity,\\" Fiji Times, January 12, 2006. and Education International.\\"Membership List: Asia-Pacific,\\" Education International, no date. The FTU was formed as a multi-racial organization. However, in 1960 the Fijian Teachers Association (FTA) was founded. The FTA limited its membership to indigenous Fijians. Most indigenous Fijian educators left the FTU, so that the FTU's membership is now overwhelmingly Indian.Padmini Gaunder, Education and Race Relations in Fiji, 1835-1998, Universal Printing, 1999. In 2004, the Fiji Teachers Union counted about 4,200 members (including over 700 indigenous Fijians). The Fiji Teachers‚Äô Association had about 3,500 members. Formation = Methodist Teachers' Association = By 1924 there were a significant number of local and overseas trained in Fiji, who saw the need for an organised group of teachers to discuss their professional and administrative matters. Under the leadership of Sewak Masih (of Toorak Boys‚Äô School), the Methodist Teachers‚Äô Association was formed and had members from Suva and Rewa. It adopted a motto: ‚ÄúTo serve the Community is to serve God‚Äù. This association of teachers kept meeting in Suva until 1927 when Sewak Masih was transferred to Levuka and this gave him an opportunity to invite all the teachers from Suva, Ba, Lautoka and Nadi to attend a conference in Levuka. A teacher by the name of Dukhharan travelled with his group from the Western Districts to attend this meeting. Among other matters a plan for a united organization of teachers was kumar Another conference of the Methodist Teachers‚Äô Association was held at Methodist Boys‚Äô School in Toorak in 1928 where the following office bearers were elected: President: Sewak Masih, Vice President: P M Stephen, Secretary: G P Andrew and Assistant Secretary: HR Narayan. John Bairagi was elected as Secretary International and BR Padarath was chosen as the Treasurer. Professional lectures were presented during the afternoon dinner by I J Beatie (M.A) on the topic ‚ÄúReality in Education‚Äù and by G H Tindlay (M.A.) on ‚ÄúPsychology‚Äù. = Lautoka Teachers' Association = There was no such organised association of teachers in the western side of Vitilevu; however, a meeting was convened at Natabua on Saturday 7 December 1929. The following teachers were present at this meeting: D A Shah, Dukharan, P M Stephen, D S John, W K Phillip, A V Ram Narayan, B L Ram Dass, R Varo, B H Sanjeu, Gulam Dastgir, J S Maiku, Jacob Wara, Peter Vatu, Farzand Ali and Pt Ami Chandra. C S Sharp, the principal of Natabua Secondary was invited to declare the meeting open. As a result of this gathering of teachers an association called The Lautoka Teachers‚Äô Association was formed under the chairmanship of Pt Ami Chandra. Dukharan was elected as the Vice President and W K Phillip became the Secretary/Treasurer. There was a committee of four executive members namely Robert Varo, D S John, P M Stephen and William. So by 1929 there were two Teachers‚Äô Unions, one in the Central and the other in the Western Division but with similar aims and objectives. = Union of the two Associations = Majority of the local teachers were the products of Davuilevu Teachers‚Äô Training Institute but the opening of Natabua Teachers‚Äô training Institute and the Cawaci Centre in 1929 produced more trained teachers for the schools. The administration of education in those days was done under the guidance and direction of the Director of Education but the status and service condition of the teachers were somewhat insecure and uncertain. Teachers were often victimised, over worked, underpaid and above all had to please many masters or bosses. The two newly formed teachers‚Äô organizations were not strong enough to voice their opinions and protests to bring harmony in the profession. The solution as seen by the teachers at that time lay in the creation of a united body of teachers for all of Fiji. On 9 March 1930 the Lautoka Teachers‚Äô Association decided to hold a conference for all the teachers of Fiji. A lot of teachers from Suva could not attend the Lautoka meeting because of the transport difficulty and the inclement weather. They held their own meeting in Suva. This date became historic for the Fiji Teachers‚Äô Union because it was at these meetings that the decision to amalgamate the Suva and Lautoka Teachers‚Äô Associations was made. Following Indian teachers from Lautoka were part of the historic decision: Dukharan, (Chairman) P M Steven, P Frank, D A Shah, S P Ram, A V Ram Narayan, B L R Dass, Shiu Charan, C William, G M Prakash, D S John, M Munam, Farzand Ali, J S Maiku, Ram Jati Singh, Ram Sundar, Rameshwar Prasad, Sher Mohammed, Badri Prasad, Kripa Masih, Andrew G Prasad and Dastgir and there were eight Fijian teachers there as well: M/s Logavatu, I Racule, Tevita, Asaeli, Kepuli, Jona, Maikeli, Isireli and Peni Tonga. Suva teachers who held their historic meeting to vote for amalgamation included the following: Sewak Masih (Chairman), Hakim Din, B Samuel Sharan, N S Deoki, J John, K P Singh, H R Ram Narayan, J R Lochan, S Bharat, R D Sharma, D P Mishra, Edward Rama, Hari Bhajan, Ami Chandra, Hari Pal, A D Sharma, J S Bhagwan, Hira Lal, B R Padarath, B H Sanjeu, John Bairagi, George Sukhdeo, Shiu Mangal, B Ram Singh and T R Sharma. Fijian teachers Phillip Cula, T Rawasalevu, W Tuiwaqa, Sairusi Natuna and Inoke Cakutini were also present. The meeting was co-chaired by Dukharan and Sewak Masih. The Conference adopted the motto of the Union with the slogan, ‚ÄúThe Child Our Hope‚Äù. The Principal of Natabua Secondary C S Sharp officially opened the historic meeting and a secondary teacher E Mason presented a professional paper for discussion. W K Phillip presented the Annual Reports of the Unions. He had taken over the position of secretary from AG Prasad who had resigned earlier in the year. The planning and organising of the Fiji Teachers‚Äô Union that had begun in 1930 was completed in 1931 when the two teachers‚Äô organizations of that time met at Natabua in Lautoka on 19 and 20 June and finally elected the officials of the National Executive. Mr S Hari Charan chaired the election procedures when D A Shah was elected the first President and Sewak Masih and S Hari Charan became the two Vice Presidents. R H Ram Narayan was elected the General Secretary with W K Phillip as his Assistant Secretary. J R Lochan became the Treasurer of the Union and there were twelve executive committee members: B H Sanjeu, R Deoki, S Parshu Ram, Andrew G Prasad, S Ram Singh, Tulsi R Sharma, Phillip Cula, I Racule, T Rawasalevu, W Tuiwaqa, Sairusi Natuni and Inoke Cakutini. At last the dream of Sewak Masih became a reality when the Fiji Teachers‚Äô Union was formed to represent all the teachers of Fiji. Total strength of the Union in 1931 was 112 and this included 18 Fijian members. Membership of the Union was open to all the teachers teaching in Fiji irrespective of their race, colour and creed. After 1931 the Fiji Teachers‚Äô Union members have been meeting regularly for their annual conferences during the first term school holidays. These meetings or conferences have been providing good opportunities to the teachers to meet each other and exchange their views and ideas. These meetings have been helping the members to make new acquaintances and learn new skills, ideas and knowledge through lectures and discussions. These conferences have also provided them a forum for active participation to further their professionalism and to update their rights and responsibilities. The venues for these Annual General Meetings depended on the branch invitations but from 1931 to 1938 they were held alternatively in Suva and Lautoka. During these years the Presidency of the Union was shared by two prominent teachers of that time, Dildhar Ali Shah and Ami Chandra. In 1939 however, the Ba Branch of the Union invited them to hold the Conference there and it was a successful event. Nadi was the next branch, which hosted the eleventh Conference in 1941 when the President was Hari Charan, who became the longest serving President of the Union-17 years. Other teachers who served as President of the Union were James Madhwan(8 years),NR Ram Krishna (1 Year), Ambika Nand (3 years), J R Lochan(1 Year), K C Ramrakha(8 years), Krishna Dutt(3 years), Shiu Narayan Kanhai (3 years), Shiu Charan, and Anil Sudhakar. The FTU registered with the national government as a trade union in 1947. 1950s and 1960s In 1930, FTU president was Dildar Ali Shah and the Secretary was W K Phillip after the Lautoka Teachers' Association and the Suva Teachers' Association amalgamated and changed the name to Fiji Teachers' Union with \\"The Child Our Hope\\" as its motto. Dildar Shah served as President until 1933 when Ami Chandra took over and remained President until 1935. ref Dr. RL Prasad(1980) K. C. Ramrakha was President of the Fiji Teachers Union from 1967 to 1973. He was also elected the General Secretary of the National Federation Party. Ramrakha was the first non-teacher to hold the position of President. His election and his leading role in the National Federation Party caused the Fijian Teachers Association to withdraw from merger talks between the two unions.Alexander Mamak, Colour, Culture & Conflict, Pergamon Press, 1978. . Post-independence In after Fiji won its independence in 1970 FTU and FTA formed the Fiji Teachers' Confederation to give them more collective bargaining power. About 1983 the President, J Singh and Vice President, Soubhagyawati Parshu Ram (first female) led the FTU Suva branch. Ms S P Ram is the daughter of former Parliamentarian, J B Tularam. The Confederation led a major teachers' strike in 1985 which led to the formation of the Fiji Labour Party. The formation of the Fiji Labour Party led to radical changes in Fijian politics (including two coups) in the 1980s and 1990s. The FTU remains competitive with the FTA for members. In 2005 and 2006, for example, many members of the FTA left that organization to join the FTU after the FTU founded a credit union which offered high interest rates on savings. In 2006, the elected civilian government of Fiji was toppled in a military coup d'√©tat. In 2007, the interim government instituted a 5 percent across-the-board wage cut for all public employees. Most public sector workers' unions struck in August 2007, seeking restoration of the salary cut and a reduction in the retirement age from 60 to 55. The FTU joined the strike.

Though it peaked on the Billboard Hot 100 at number 49 on June 8, 1963, Medley and his partner, Bobby Hatfield, were offered a national distribution contract by VeeJay records. It was purchased the following year by Phil Spector, who went on to produce their most successful recordings. The song has been covered by more than twenty artists, notably by Bruce Springsteen, from 1977-2009. Original version Little Latin Lupe Lu (\\"Lupe\\") was written by 19 year-old Bill Medley when he and Bobby Hatfield were in a five-piece band called The Paramours. It's about a girl he dated at Santa Ana High School in California named Lupe Laguna, whose nickname was \\"Lupe Lu.\\" Medley later described it as \\"a silly little song, about a girl who likes to dance\\". He taught the song to Hatfield, then contacted Ray Maxwell, the owner of a local label called Moonglow Records, who came to hear the duo sing it. Maxwell had them record the song, but since it was just Hatfield and Medley, they needed a new name. This often-told story varies in location, but always involves U.S. Marines stationed at the nearby El Toro Marine base. At the end of a performance, an African-American soldier in the audience shouted, \\"That was righteous, brothers!\\" Walking in from the parking lot for another performance, a group of Marines spotted them, and one called out, \\"Hey righteous brothers, how you doin'?\\" From then on, they were \\"The Righteous Brothers\\". Nothing happened when \\"Lupe\\" was released, so Hatfield and Medley took some gigs at The Rendezvous Ballroom in Newport Beach, California, which was a surf-rock dance club where Dick Dale also played. According to Medley, they were reluctant at first to perform, but \\"it fit this surf dance that they were doing\\", and became a big hit with the patrons. When the local record store told their new fans they had never heard of it, \\"Bobby Hatfield and our road manager took about 1500 copies to the record store, and we told the kids where to buy them. Well, 1500 kids went down and bought this record.\\" In the same 2010 interview, Medley explained, \\"In those days, radio stations would call record stores to see what was selling.\\" When Los Angeles stations KFWB and KRLA heard that 1500 records had been sold, they added \\"Lupe\\" to their programing list, and soon they were getting requests for the song. It became a local hit, reaching #4 on KRLA and #5 on KFWB. On May 11, 1963, it entered the Billboard Hot 100, reaching #49, and finishing after 7 weeks on the chart. It also reached #47 on the Cashbox music chart. Cover versions The south Minneapolis surf rock band The Chancellors recorded \\"Little Latin Lupe Lu\\" on October 13, 1964 at Kay Bank Studios in Minneapolis. The record was released under the Soma label in the United States and Apex Records in Canada. It was a regional hit for The Chancellors, arriving on the WDGY charts December 26, 1964 and reaching #1 in Minneapolis on January 23, 1965. The Chancellors remained at #1 for three weeks and in the Top 40 for 11 weeks. As \\"Little Latin Lupe Lu\\" faded from the Twin Cities‚Äô charts, it appeared in Chicago on April 2, 1965. The Chancellors stayed in the WLS charts for seven weeks, peaking at #14.Chicago Top 40 Charts 1960-1969, compiled by Ronald P. Smith, Writers Club Press, The Kingsmen recorded a version of the song reaching #46 on the Billboard chart and #49 on the Cashbox chart in 1964. In 1966, Mitch Ryder & The Detroit Wheels had the most success with their recording, hitting #16 on Cashbox and #17 on Billboard. A few years later, the pioneering all-woman garage band The Heart Beats released a version where Lupe Lu was a boy. The song has been performed multiple times by Bruce Springsteen, most recently in 2009 on his Working on a Dream Tour at Gillette Stadium in Massachusetts as a request by sign from a fan with the lyrics written on the back of the sign. Film reference \\"Little Latin Lupe Lu\\" is mentioned in the film High Fidelity (based on the Nick Hornby novel of the same name) as track number 2 on Barry's (played by Jack Black) Monday-morning mix tape. The other employee, Dick, states that he prefers the version by Mitch Ryder & the Detroit Wheels, which angers Barry due to his belief that The Righteous Brothers' original is the best version.

Rather than contracting for the acquisition of goods and services, the product support manager identifies product support integrator(s) (PSI) to deliver performance outcomes as defined by performance metric(s) for a system or product. The integrator often commits to this performance level at a lower cost, or increased performance at costs similar to those previously achieved under a non-PBL or transactional portfolio of product support arrangements for goods and services. The preferred approach to supporting weapon system logistics. It seeks to deliver product support as an integrated, affordable performance package designed to optimize system readiness. PBL meets performance goals for a weapon system through a support structure based on long-term performance agreements with clear lines of authority and responsibility.Defense Acquisition University Acquipedia Article, \\"Performance Based Logistics\\" DoD program managers are required to develop and implement performance-based life-cycle support strategies for weapon systems. These strategies should optimize total system availability while minimizing cost and logistics footprint. Trade-off decisions involve cost, useful service, and effectiveness. The selection of the specific performance metrics should be carefully considered and supported by an operationally oriented analysis, taking into account technology maturity, fiscal constraints, and schedule. In implementing performance-based life-cycle product support strategies, the metrics should be appropriate to the scope of product support integrators and providers responsibilities and should be revisited as necessary to ensure they are motivating the desired behaviors across the enterprise.Defense Acquisition Guidebook, Section 5.1.1.2Defense Acquisition Guidebook, Section 5.1.1.3 PBL strategies do not mandate that work be contracted to commercial contractors; integrating the best features of the public and private sectors is a key component of the support strategy.

Examples include the C-17 PBL, FIRST, and PBtH. Ideally, the provider profits by controlling constituent elements (PSIs) that are used to generate the performance results. In PBL, typically a part or the whole payment is tied to the performance of the provider and the purchaser does not get involved in the details of the process, it becomes crucial to define a clear set of requirements to the provider Asadabadi, M.

History  Beginning in the early 1990s, emerging trends towards increases in the costs to support fielded systems and decreases in the general reliability and operational readiness of weapon systems were recognized as issues that could continue if unabated. As a result, a performance-based approach, PBL, was advanced by the U.S. DoD in its annual Quadrennial Defense Review in 2001. Since then, not only has the U.S. DoD adopted the PBL approach, but other countries have adopted this strategy as well. Many programs that have employed it have yielded increased system availability, shorter maintenance cycles, and/or reduced costs. =Awards= Since the inception of the PBL concept, there have been numerous examples of DoD systems that have yielded the anticipated results, and many that have exceeded ‚Äì some extremely so ‚Äì the performance expectations. Annual PBL awards highlight achievement in three areas: * component-level performance * sub- system performance * system-level performance Criticism In 2009, partially in response to some who believed that PBL concepts were inadequate, and to assess the current state of DoD systems sustainment, DoD‚Äôs Office of the Assistant Deputy Secretary of Defense for Materiel Readiness (OADUSD(MR)) initiated a Weapon System Acquisition Reform Product Support Assessment. Its final report, signed by Ashton B.

It is located along the Nordland Line and the station serves the Sparbu and M√¶re areas of Steinkjer. The unmanned station is only served by the Tr√∏ndelag Commuter Rail service between Steinkjer and Trondheim, and is located near the E6 highway. History The station was built as part of Hell‚ÄìSunnan Line and opened on 15 November 1905 along with the rest of the line north of Verdals√∏ra. The original station included three tracks, the extra two were and long, respectively. These tracks have since been removed and no passing is available at the station. Construction costs for the station were and plans were drawn by Paul Armin Due. Originally, it was named Sparbuen, but on 15 January 1910, the spelling was changed to Sparbu. The station was manned until 1980, and it has since been sold and the station building has been converted to a private residence. =Location= There was an extensive debate about the location of the station locally. Because the municipalities had to finance 15% of the investments in the railway, the municipal councils also got to determine important issues like the location of stations. The policy at the time was to allow one station for each municipality. The first debate was concerning the line through the municipality, where locals suggested two different lines both going further east to go via the settlement Lein where the only dairy and a local store was located. But the chief engineer of the project would not recommend either of the suggestions since they would be up to longer, cost up to more money, and go through more hilly terrain. So it was chosen to keep the original suggestion for a line from 1893. Instead a major debate about the location of a station surfaced, with suggestions to place the station at K√•berg (what is now called Sparbu) or at M√¶re. Advocates for the K√•berg alternative felt that K√•berg was closest to the centre of the community. On the other hand, the M√¶re advocates felt that proximity to the new M√¶re Agricultural School was important. In reality, people chose the alternative closest to their own doorstep. The original plans also included a station at Vist. The city council voted to support the K√•berg/Vist alternative on 17 January 1900. But by the time it had reached the Storting (legislature), an alternative to replace the two stations with one at M√¶re was chosen, and on 5 June 1900 the Storting voted to only build one station in Sparbu, located at M√¶re. But locals pleaded their members of Storting to reconsider the matter, and on 24 April 1901, the Storting changed their decision to the original suggestion with stations at K√•berg and Vist. In 1904, the county engineer once again suggested moving the station to M√¶re for technical reasons, but the problems were overcome and two stations built, Sparbu Station and Vist Station. By 1917, M√¶re patriots had chosen to build the privately funded M√¶re Station.

He was born and died in Milltown, County Galway. Molloy originally intended to become a priest, but contracted tuberculosis as a young man. He began writing during his long hospital stays in the 1930s. His first play, Old Road, was produced at the Abbey Theatre in 1943. His plays were popular in the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s, and generally presented by the Abbey Theatre, but only one of his later plays, Petticoat Loose (1979) was staged at the Abbey. He has been viewed as a natural successor to Synge, by such as Prof Robt O'Driscoll (see below), and Molloy himself saying in the Irish Times in Sept 1955 - \\"Does Synge influence me?. Not directly, but the people who gave him his material do. My neighbourhood at home is full of Synge characters\\". His second play was The Visiting House was produced at the Abbey in late 1946. It was inspired to an extent by his own visits to the house of local Milltown blacksmith Michael Silke, where stories were told and tales re-enacted. This was in a time when electricity supply had not reached the locality and, with his interest in folklore, throughout the 1940s and into the 1950s MJ travelled (by bicycle) within a ten-mile radius of Milltown recording stories and folklore from many rural households. (Old Road by M.J.Molloy; is set in rural Galway in the spring and summer of 1939. The spectre of the Second World War looms large over a group of young people who are desperate to escape to a better life in England. Land ownership, poverty, lack of opportunity and old-fashioned marriage customs threaten to drive the younger generation away from their native Connaught. The action takes place in the household of the choleric, cantankerous and tyrannical old farmer Lordeen; who, desperate for a wife, engages the services of the mercenary matchmaker William Duffy. In the meanwhile, love blossom between the Lord's servants, the cool and happy-go- lucky Myles Cosgrave and the damsel-in-distress Bridgeen McDonagh who do their best to deny their passion for each other. Bodhagh Merrigan, a conniving land- grabber manipulates the Lordeen's situation to lay hold of his farm, whilst Merrigan's own son Paak must go to England, denied the chance of a small holding and marriage to his first love Mary. Lordeen's other labourer, the cobbler and self-styled intellectual Luke Sweeney, is the target for the affections of the caustic, ‚Äòblack‚Äô widow, Mrs Callaghan. Merrigan and Mrs Callaghan collude to ensure that Lordeen finds out that Myles has been trading agricultural goods to make up the shortfall in his pay. Lordeen, in a fit of Rage calls for the Sergeant who decides not to press charges, torn between his duty to the law and what he feels to be his own Christian moral code. Myles proposes to Brigid who readily accepts and in hope of staying in Ireland asks Merrigan to allow them to rent small holding on his land. Believing that this is part of a scheme to dupe the Sergeant, Merrigan agrees. When the Sergeant leaves, Merrigan denies Myles the opportunity to rent and tells him to let Brigid go to England by herself. Merrigan pursues the Patrick Walsh to sell him his farm, but the Lordeen clutching to the hope of finding a wife refuses to sell and is set to drink himself into oblivion. The others arrive and dissuade Brigid from marrying Myles and they leave set for an uncertain future in England.) His most famous and successful plays were: * The King of Friday's Men(1948) - which was produced in both London and New York, as well as being regularly revived by the Abbey in later decades * The Paddy Pedlar (1952) - which had its first staging when produced by his brother Gerry with Ballina Dramatic Society in 1952, and won the All-Ireland Amateur Drama Festival Award. It was staged by the Abbey and also broadcst on BBC and RTE. * The Wood of the Whispering (1953) - Revived by the Abbey in the 1960s, also staged at Stratford in 1963, and in the 1980s by Druid Theatre/Gary Hynes at Dublin Theatre Festival. * Daughter from over the Water(1963) had a successful run at the Gaiety Theatre in Dublin in 1964, starring Siobhan McKenna.

It was released to radio in December 2002 by Warner Music Philippines as the album's first promo single in lieu of the album's release in the Philippines. The song was written by Arnie Mendaros, and produced by Neil Gregorio. As soon as Nina sent her demo to Warner and immediately got a contract with the label, production for her first album began. \\"2nd Floor\\" became one of the first OPM songs to feature Taglish lyrics and a pop-R&B; arrangement. Nina's whistle register is very evident on the song. Upon release, the song and the album were met with critical acclaim, with most critics pointing out the international sound and smooth production as well as Nina's wide vocal range. The song also earned her the Best New Artist awards on both Awit Awards and MTV Pilipinas Music Awards. \\"2nd Floor\\" was well received by the Philippine Association of the Record Industry (PARI) that it was given four nominations on the 2003 Awit Awards, where it won the Best R&B; category. Background and release At seventeen, she became a vocalist of the XS, The Big Thing, MYMP, Silk and lastly, the Essence. After college, she recorded an amateur demo CD with the help of a friend. It was composed of three tracks, including the Steve Perry song \\"Foolish Heart\\", \\"Breathe Again\\" and \\"Against All Odds (Take a Look at Me Now)\\", recorded in a home studio with only a guitar for accompaniment. After listening to the demos, Warner Music managing director at that time, Ricky Ilacad wanted to sign her up even without seeing or hearing her in person. Two months after her father died of a heart attack in the United States, she signed her first contract with Warner Music. Under the direction of Ilacad, foreign songwriters and arrangers from the United States and Korea, including Shelly Peiken and Guy Roche, were hired for the production of the album. The album is heavily influenced by jazzy lounge pop-R&B; and composed of songs that are reminiscent to the sound of international records at that time. \\"2nd Floor\\" is considered to be a radio- only single. It was released in December 2002 without commercial support and promotion. Since it was not commercially released, the song had no official music video, and only a live performance of Nina was issued in music video channels. The song was released to digital download on January 23, 2007 via iTunes and Amazon.com MP3 Download. Composition \\"2nd Floor\\", as well as other songs in Heaven, is heavily influenced by jazzy lounge pop-R&B; which was different from other OPM records at that time. The song was written by Arnie Mendaros, who was Nina's vocal coach for the album, and produced by Neil Gregorio. The song features Taglish lyrics and an urban feel Mendaros incorporated to the music. It is one of the earliest Filipino pop-R&B; songs, and showcases Nina's evident use of whistle register, which ranges up to B‚ô≠6. The song narrates how a girl feels for her loved one. Awards and accolades In the 2003 Awit Awards, the song earned Nina four nominations--Best Performance by a Female Recording Artist, Song of the Year, Best Produced Record of the Year and Best R&B; song. Despite not being commercially released, it won the Best R&B; award and earned Nina the People's Choice award for Favorite New Female Artist. However, the Best Female Artist and Record of the Year awards were lost to Bituin Escalante's \\"Kung Ako na Lang Sana\\" and the Song of the Year to Jamie Rivera's \\"Only Selfless Love\\". Live performances Heaven was the first album of Nina as a breakthrough artist, making her unfamiliar to everyone at that time. To gain fans and promote her album, she has done concert performances, bar gigs and TV appearances. In 2002, she was featured in an episode of MYX Live!, hosted by Rico Blanco, where she performed \\"2nd Floor\\". Aside from performing a few songs from the album, she sang \\"Through the Fire\\", \\"It Might Be You\\", and Mariah Carey's \\"Never Too Far\\" and \\"Through the Rain\\". At the same year, she had a back-to- back major concert with Kyla entitled Cold War. The concert began when rivalry sparked between the two artists, and its production was full of showdowns and face offs. Their rivalry was so strong, it was even compared to that of Nora Aunor and Vilma Santos. She has also performed Heaven singles on MTV Live and on the first ever MYX Mo!, where she performed a clear live whistle on the song that surprised the audience.

The name is no longer in official use and the line is now considered part of the Nordland Line. The Hell‚ÄìSunnan Line branches from the Mer√•ker Line at Hell and runs on the east shore of the Trondheimsfjord passing through the municipalities of Stj√∏rdal, Levanger, Verdal, Inder√∏y and Steinkjer. The Norwegian State Railways (NSB) started construction in 1899 and the first part of the line, from Hell to Stj√∏rdalshalsen, opened on 1 February 1902. The railway opened to Levanger on 29 October 1902, to Verdals√∏ra on 1 November 1904 and to Sunnan on 15 November 1905. Sunnan was chosen as terminus because of its location on the southern end of the lake of Sn√•savatnet. The line was further extended to Sn√•sa in 1926, after which it has been classified as part of the Nordland Line. The railway is the most heavily trafficked non-electrified line in Norway, with the Tr√∏ndelag Commuter Rail running south of Steinkjer. It is also used by intercity passenger and freight trains. Route Map of the Hell‚ÄìSunnan Line The Hell‚ÄìSunnan Line constitutes the section of the Nordland Line between Hell, Stj√∏rdal and Sunnan, Steinkjer.Ho√•s and Stene (2006): 5 At the time of the line's opening, it was long.Norwegian National Rail Administration (2009): 44 The railway is single track,Norwegian National Rail Administration (2009): 6 standard gauge, non-electrified,Norwegian National Rail Administration (2009): 4 and equipped with centralized traffic control,Norwegian National Rail Administration (2009): 37 partial automatic train control,Norwegian National Rail Administration (2009): 40 and GSM-R.Norwegian National Rail Administration (2009): 42 The railway line is owned and maintained by the Norwegian National Rail Administration.Norwegian National Rail Administration (2009): 3 Starting in the south at Hell Station, which is located from Trondheim Central Station (Trondheim S), the Mer√•ker Line branches from the Nordland Line. The latter crosses the river of Stj√∏rdalselva on a truss bridge. It passes the closed Sandferhus Station before reaching Trondheim Airport Station ( from Trondheim S), which serves as an airport rail link and is situated below the terminal of Trondheim Airport, V√¶rnes.Bjerke and Holom (1994): 95 Previously there was a spur from Sandferhus to V√¶rnes and √òyanmoen.Bjerke and Holom (1994): 92 The mainline continues under the airport's taxiway and runway in the two V√¶rnes Tunnels, the latter which is long, after which the line reaches Stj√∏rdal Station (). The line continues past the closed Vold Station, which was built to serve a mill,Ho√•s and Stene (2006): 27 to Skatval, through which the line makes a semi-circular detour.Bjerke and Holom (1994): 93 Here it serves Skatval Station () and the closed Alstad Station. Alstad was previously an important station as it was conveniently placed for boat access from Frosta.Ho√•s and Stene (2006): 29 Located at above mean sea level (AMSL), it was the highest elevated station on the line. The line then enters the municipality of Levanger, where it first reaches the closed Langstein Station and then the closed Vudu Station. After Vudu, the line reaches its highest elevation of when it crosses over European Road 6 (E6). The line then reaches √Ösen Station () before continuing past the closed Hammerberg Station to Ronglan Station (). Before reaching Skogn Station (), a spur branches off to Fiborgtangen, serving Norske Skog Skogn. The mainline continues past Eggen Station and over the E6, past the closed Sykehuset Levanger Station, which served Levanger Hospital, before reaching Levanger Station (). It then crosses the river Levangselva on a bridge. It passes the closed Elberg Station and to reach HiNT Station (), which serves the Levanger campus of Nord-Tr√∏ndelag University College.

It is followed by the closed Fleskhus Station and Bj√∏rga Station before entering the municipality of Inder√∏y at the Koabj√∏rgen Tunnel. The only station in Inder√∏y is R√∏ra Station (); however the line does not enter Steinkjer before passing through the Lunnan Tunnel. After passing the closed Vollan Station, the line reaches Sparbu Station (). It then passes the closed M√¶re Station and Vist Station and crosses over the bridge over Figgja to reach Steinkjer Station (). The line runs over the river of Steinkjerelva on a truss bridge.

The Nordland Line continues over a bridge across Sn√•savatnet. History =Planning= Planning of a railway to connect Tr√∏ndelag and J√§mtland, Sweden, started in 1869, with one of the proposals being to build a line from Trondheim via Verdal to Sweden.R√∏e (1982): 10‚Äì11 However, surveys along the Verdal proposed route deemed it unsuitable,R√∏e (1982): 12‚Äì13 and instead the line was built via Stj√∏rdalen and Mer√•ker. To conform with Swedish standards, the line was built with standard gauge instead of the in Norway more common narrow gauge.R√∏e (1982): 14‚Äì15 The Mer√•ker Line opened on 22 July 1882. In Stj√∏rdal, controversy arose over the route. The river of Stj√∏rdalselva creates a barrier just north of Hell, which made it cheaper to build the line on the south shore of the river to Hegra. However, the major population center was located at Stj√∏rdalshalsen, on the north shore of the river. Locally, there were many protests against the line bypassing such a large town, but the cost of the bridge made Parliament choose the southern alternative. This gave residents in the town an around 3 kilometres (2 miles) route to the train, since they had to cross the river to get access to the railway.Museumskart 116: Deler av Trondhimsfjorden: Nord-Tr√∏ndelag,S√∏r-Tr√∏ndelag (1897) This decreased the railway's ability to compete with the steam ships and thus the overall profitability of the line.R√∏e (1982): 16‚Äì17 With the arrival of the railway, transport to Trondheim became much easier than to Stj√∏rdalshalsen and Levanger, helping Trondheim grow as a regional center.R√∏e (1982): 44‚Äì46 The Nordland Line was first publicly proposed by Ole Tobias Olsen in a letter to the editor in Morgenbladet in 1872, where he argued for a railway between Trondheim and his home county of Nordland.Ho√•s and Stene (2006): 14 The same year, Nord-Tr√∏ndelag County Council voted in favor to start planning of a railway between Trondheim and Namsos.Ho√•s and Stene (2006): 15 The county council appointed a railway committee in 1875,Ho√•s and Stene (2006): 18 who on 23 August 1876 published a report to encourage national authorities to consider the line,Ho√•s and Stene (2006): 19 which resulted in surveying starting in 1877. On 27 April 1881, the committee made its recommendation to the county council and ceased its work. No planning was done the next three years, until three county councilors, Vilhelm Andreas Wexelsen, Peter Theodor Holst and Bernhard √òverland, made a new proposal.Ho√•s and Stene (2006): 20 However, it was not until 1889 that the county council appointed a new railway committee, which was led by Wexelsen.Ho√•s and Stene (2006): 21 Stj√∏rdalselva Bridge in 1927 In 1891, the county's road committee, led by √òverland, sent an official request to the railway committee, asking for details about their plans, so the appropriate roads could be planned. This spurred the committees work and a cooperation with Nordland County Council was initiated to increase the projects priority by national politicians.Ho√•s and Stene (2006): 22 On 2 March 1896, with 87 against 27 votes, Parliament passed legislation approving a railway from Hell to Sunnan. Costs were estimated at 8.75 million Norwegian krone (NOK), of which 15 percent was to be financed with local grants and the remainder by the state. Construction was scheduled to take 15 years. The decision initially called for the railway to be built in two stages, with the split at Rinnan in Levanger‚Äîthe site of the military camp Rinnleiret.Ho√•s and Stene (2006): 23 Final approval of construction was made by Parliament on 11 June 1898.Ho√•s and Stene (2006): 24 =Construction= At Hell, there arose a disagreement about where the Hell‚ÄìSunnan Line should branch from the Mer√•ker Line. Initial proposals were to place the branch from a location before Hell Station, thus forcing trains to back up from Hell Station before continuing northwards. The station building at Hell was also too small for the increased traffic, so it was moved to Sunnan Station and a new station building, with capacity for 25 employees, was built at Hell.Ho√•s and Stene (2006): 26 In Skatval, there was a controversy as to whether the station should be built at M√¶hre or Alstad. M√¶hre (later Skatval) had support from the municipal council and was closer to the larger share of the area's population. However, the military wanted Alstad, as it was a rally point for the military in case of a Swedish invasion, and gave easy waterway access from Frosta.Ho√•s and Stene (2006): 28 The station was placed at M√¶hre, while a passing loop was built at Alstad. The most difficult work was through Grubb√•sen, near √Ösen. The ground consisted of quick clay, which the railway was to pass through in a trench. On 5 May 1900, a landslide filled the trench, killing three navvies.Ho√•s and Stene (2006): 30 Past the lake of Nesvannet, there was also weak soil mechanics, resulting in the need for piling. One worker was killed after getting hit by a piling log.Ho√•s and Stene (2006): 31 In Levanger, there was debate as to whether the station should be on the west or east side of the tracks, with the decision falling on the west side.Ho√•s and Stene (2006): 32 The section from Hell to Stj√∏rdal started revenue service on 1 February 1902. The section from Stj√∏rdalshalsen to Levanger was officially opened on 27 October 1902,Ho√•s and Stene (2006): 35 with ordinary services starting on 29 October.Ho√•s and Stene (2006): 37 Hell Station‚Äîthe Mer√•ker Line continues straight ahead while the Hell‚ÄìSunnan Line diverts to the left Construction on the line's second part, from Levanger to Sunnan, started in 1901. Part of the reason for the early start was to help employ older navvies who were working on the southern section during the summer.Ho√•s and Stene (2006): 45 By early 1904, the right-of-way to Fleskhus was completed and the laying of tracks could begin.Ho√•s and Stene (2006): 46 The bridge over Verdalselva was built using of stone, which had to be transported from Baglo√•sen in Levanger. The superstructure was built by Vulkan of Oslo and was installed between 9 September and 27 November 1903.Ho√•s and Stene (2006): 47 In Verdals√∏ra there again arose a debate over which side of the tracks the station should be on. The townspeople wanted it on the west side, which was on the same side as the town center, while farmers wanted it east side, which was most accessible from the valley. The result was that the station was placed on the east side.Ho√•s and Stene (2006): 50 The section from Levanger to Verdal was opened on 1 November 1904, although the station building was not completed until 1905. At the time there were two trains per direction per day, one passenger train and one post train.Ho√•s and Stene (2006): 51 R√∏ra Station in the late 1940s For the bridge over Ydseelva in Verdal, which had a main span of only , construction started in April 1903 and was completed on 21 November. The area has quick clay, so the bridge needed piling.Ho√•s and Stene (2006): 53 At R√∏ra, a spur was originally planned to Hylla, but this was discarded late in the planning phase. At Hellem in Inder√∏y the right-of-way had to be moved because of poor soil mechanics. There were similar issues north of the Lunnan Tunnel, forcing the tunnel to be extended and a support being built. Construction of the tunnel was performed by 40 men during the winter of 1904 and 1905. It cost NOK 90,179 and took 23.9 man-hours per meter to build.Ho√•s and Stene (2006): 57 In the former municipality of Sparbu, there was a contentious debate over both the route and the location of the station. Although the line was built where it had originally been planned, two alternatives were launched, both which saw the line go further east and higher up in the terrain. At the time both the dairy and store were located at Lein. The current villages of Sparbu and M√¶re had not been established, and locals wanted the railway to go through Lein, which was the de facto municipal center. However, the alternatives were longer and would run through more rolling terrain, so the engineers insisted on the original route.Ho√•s and Stene (2006): 58 The plans called for a station at Leira (today known as Sparbu) and at Vist, but many locals instead wanted it at M√¶re, in part to serve the new M√¶re Agricultural School.Ho√•s and Stene (2006): 59 On 5 June 1900, Parliament voted in favor of only one station, at M√¶re. However, the decision was reverted by Parliament on 24 April 1901.Ho√•s and Stene (2006): 60 A support wall was built at S√∏rlia, just south of Steinkjer, after there was a clay landslide. Construction of the bridge over Figgja, just south of Steinkjer, was performed in 1904. The superstructure was built by Kv√¶rner of Oslo and installed between 11 November and 21 December 1904.Ho√•s and Stene (2006): 61 The bridge over Steinkjerelva took up a significant portion of the old river port in Steinkjer, resulting in a spur being built to a new port location. The railway ran right through the town center, forcing 20 houses to be demolished and splitting the town in two.Ho√•s and Stene (2006): 63 The arrival and route of the railway was described by some locals as vandalism. A counter-proposal which saw the line run further up and cross through Steinkjersannan and Furuskogen‚Äîand thus avoid the town itself‚Äîwas discarded because it would wreck the military camp at Steinkjersannan and would be located too far from the port. There was also a major debate as to whether the station should be on the south side or north side of the river. The municipal council voted for the south side with the mayor's double vote being decisive.Ho√•s and Stene (2006): 64 Construction of the bridge over Steinkjerelva started in August 1902 and was completed on 7 May 1904. A proposal to build the bridge as a swing bridge was dropped, forcing the railways to pay NOK 45,402 in compensation to companies with facilities upstream.Ho√•s and Stene (2006): 65 Steinkjer is surrounded by a moraine which had to be traversed with a cutting, long and up to deep. of earthwork was removed, half with a steam shovel, and largely used to build reclaimed land for the railway's right-of-way through Steinkjer.Ho√•s and Stene (2006): 72 The official opening of the section between Verdal and Sunnan took place on 14 November 1905.Ho√•s and Stene (2006): 77 Revenue service started the following day. M√¶re Station in the late 1940s =Operation= The choice of route through Innherred was largely without much debate, as the line naturally went through all the towns and most of the important villages. Sunnan was a natural place to halt construction, as it is located at the foot of the lake of Sn√•savatnet, allowing connection with steam ships.Ho√•s and Stene (2006): 79 Scheduled services on Sn√•savatnet started in 1871 with SS Dina, which was replaced with SS Bonden in 1885. From 1904 to 1921, Bonden was supplemented with MS St. Olaf, although SS Bonden remained in corresponding service with the train until 1926.Bjerke and Holom (1994): 303 Even before planning of the Hell‚ÄìSunnan Line was completed, there arose disagreement as to the route onwards. In a plan from the 1870s, there was consensus that the towns of Stj√∏rdal, Levanger, Steinkjer and Namsos should receive a line, but there was a disagreement as to the route. The Beitstad Line would run from Steinkjer via Beitstad and Namdalseid to Namsos and from there to Grong, while the Sn√•sa Line would run from Sunnan via Sn√•sa to Grong, with a branch from Grong to Namsos.Ho√•s and Stene (2006): 80 The Beitstad Line would run through the most densely populated areas, while the Sn√•sa Line was shorter. Parliament decided on the Sn√•sa Line in 1900.Ho√•s and Stene (2006): 81 The railway was extended from Sunnan to Sn√•sa Station on 30 October 1926, with the section from Hell to Sunnan becoming classified as part of the Nordland Line. The railway was completed to Bod√∏ on 7 June 1962.Ho√•s and Stene (2006): 82 Class 92 diesel multiple unit at HiNT Station, which has only a shed and serves Nord-Tr√∏ndelag University College in Levanger In 1909, a station was opened at Fossemvatnet, followed by a station at Fleskhus in 1913. M√¶re continued to be the dominant center of Sparbu, so in 1915, the national authorities offered to build a station there. However, the municipality would not grant the necessary NOK 6,300, so the station was funded with private donations. Construction started in 1916 and M√¶re Station opened on 1 April 1917. In the original plans for the railway, a spur was planned from north of Steinkjerelva to Eggebogen in Egge. However, in the parliamentary voting for the line, the spur was removed.Ho√•s and Stene (2006): 69 In 1915, a public report criticized the railway for not having sufficient access to a proper port in Steinkjer, as S√∏rsileiret was located on the river and did not have a deep quay. The municipal council voted in favor of a new quay at Eggebogen on 16 May 1916, which was completed in 1924.Ho√•s and Stene (2006): 71 The spur to Bogakaia opened on 15 August 1927, having cost NOK 139,200.Ho√•s and Stene (2006): 70 A station was opened at √òstborg in 1923, at Alstad in 1934, and at Hammerberg, Eggen and Bergsgrav in 1938. In 1940, a spur was built to V√¶rnes Air Station and √òyanmoen. A new, wooden station building was built at √Ösen in 1943 and 1944. The section to V√¶rnes was removed in 1947. Vudu Station opened in 1950, followed by Vollan in 1952 and Bj√∏rga and Sandferhus in the following year. From June to October 1953, a station was in use at Bj√∏rga. From 1957, NSB started replacing steam trains on the line by introducing Di 3 locomotives.N√¶ss (1999): 25 In 1956, NATO granted funding for an expansion of the runway at Trondheim Airport, V√¶rnes. The easiest way was to extend the runway by building it over the road and railway and into the river. Construction started in 1959Hovd (2000): 176‚Äì177 and on 1 June 1960, the V√¶rnes Tunnel was brought into use. A spur was built to Fiborgtangen in February 1966. Two years later, Elberg Station wax opened. Fossemvatnet Station was closed in 1972. The line received centralized traffic control in four phases: from Trondheim to Stj√∏rdal on 11 January 1976, to Levanger on 9 January 1977, to Steinkjer on 6 December 1977 and to Sn√•sa on 23 November 1984. Bergsgrav Station was opened on 6 December 1977. In 1981, Di 4-locomotives were introduced.N√¶ss: 72 The spur to √òyanmoen was taken out of use and removed in October 1982. NSB introduced Class 92 diesel multiple units in 1985, cutting travel time on local services between Steinkjer and Trondheim by 25 minutes. In 1989, the station building at Sunnan was demolished. In 1989 and 1990, five stations were closed, consisting on Sandferhus, Vold, Vollan, Vist and Sunnan. Class 93 train at Trondheim Airport Station On 1 September 1993, NSB launched the Tr√∏ndelag Commuter Rail, of which the main service ran from Steinkjer to Trondheim. The initial plans called for the continued use of the Class 92 rolling stock, but saw change in schedules and the upgrading platforms for NOK 15 million. At the same time, the stations of Alstad, Langstein and Fleskhus were closed. The service from Trondheim to Steinkjer had ten daily round trips. After six months operation, the service had experienced a 40 percent growth in patronage. This was further increased with the opening of Trondheim Airport Station on 15 November 1994, which cost NOK 24 million. The upgrades to the airport also included a new taxiway, which resulted in second V√¶rnes Tunnel being built.Hovd (2000): 315‚Äì316 A station was also established to serve Levanger Hospital on 20 December 1995. On 10 November 1994, the line received automatic train control. NSB was split up on 1 December 1996 and the ownership of the tracks and infrastructure was inherited by the Norwegian National Rail Administration, while the operation of trains was taken over by the new NSB. From 1994, Di 6 and Di 8 locomotives were introduced, but the Di 6 proved unreliable and returned to the manufacturer.N√¶ss: 100 In 2000, NSB started using Class 93 diesel multiple units on intercity trains, retiring the Di 3. In March 2000, NSB announced the closing of several stations for the commuter train service. Fifty percent of the stations were responsible for only two percent of the traffic, and NSB instead wanted buses to transport people to the closest railway station, which would reduce overall transport time for most passengers. From 7 January 2001, a fixed, hourly headway was introduced on the trains from Steinkjer to Trondheim. M√¶re, √òstborg, Rinnan and Elberg were closed, but HiNT R√∏stad opened. From June 2001, NSB introduced additional rush-hour trains between Trondheim and Steinkjer, giving a half-hour headway. The Nordland Line had not received NSB's first generation of train radio, Scanet, so was among the first lines to receive GSM-R from 1 December 2004. In 2010, CargoNet started using Vossloh Euro locomotives. Sykehuset Levanger Station was closed on 11 December 2010. Despite generating some 90,000 annual patrons and being one of the busiest stations on the line, it was located too close to Levanger Station to meet safety requirements. Architecture The preserved Levanger Station was built in a combination of Medieval, Gothic and Romanesque style. The stations were designed by Paul Due (1835‚Äì1919) and his son, Paul Armin Due (1870‚Äì1926).Ho√•s and Stene (2006): 89 Original stations between Stj√∏rdal and Levanger were designed by Paul Due, while those from Rinnan to Byafossen, as well as Hell Station, were designed by Paul Armin Due.Ho√•s and Stene (2006): 83 The designs are characterized by the transition period between Dragestil and Art Nouveau, with early stations dominated more by the former and later stations more by the latter. Norway went through a nationalistic period during the construction, and Paul Due chose to replace his older buildings' foreign elements with traditional Norwegian elements. R√∏ra and Byafossen were the only stations not custom designed, while Sunnan was designed by Peter Andreas Blix‚Äîas it was originally built at Hell in 1881.Ho√•s and Stene (2006): 84 At the time of construction, the railways provided a leap in transport for the communities it passed through. NSB saw beautiful and grand stations as a way to draw patronage, and chose, in addition to impressive architecture, to build a park adjacent each stations.Ho√•s and Stene (2006): 88 As construction went by, funding for stations were reduced, resulting in less grandeur further north. Most stations had two stories and an attic, although some of the stations serving lesser places had smaller buildings. From Steinkjer to Skogn, the ground floors were built in random rubble. As construction continued, budgets were reduced and station costs were cut. From Rinnan to Sparbu, the ground floors were instead built in brick, and from M√¶re and north, the stations have wooden ground floors. In addition to a station buildings, stations consisted of an outhouse and a freight house; selected stations also featured a water tower and motive power depot. The preserved Skogn Station is an example of the stations' style mix, with a random rubble ground story and wooden upper story, and with elements from both Dragestil and Art Nouveau Levanger Station is the most spectacular station on the line and also the best preserved town station. Built entirely in stone, it has a dominant position in town and with a park in front of the station. It was designed in combined Medieval style, with strong elements of Gothic and Romanesque style.Hartmann et al. (1997): 165 Steinkjer Station was the other station entirely built in stone. It has a combined Baroque Revival and Art Nouveau style, and is more anonymous than Levanger Station. Its characteristics were largely lost after it was connected with the bus station.Hartmann et al. (1997): 164 Three stations, Langstein, Skogn and Levanger, have been preserved, while Skatval and Hell have been protected.Ho√•s and Stene (2006): 85 In 1993, NSB built new sheds on all stations served by the commuter rail. Linje Arkitekter designed sheds which combined the existing architectural traditions in material and roof shapes, with modern style. The sheds have a roof, glass walls and a framework in wood. They were optimized to give good protection from various types weather. Service The main passenger service on the section from Hell to Steinkjer is the Tr√∏ndelag Commuter Rail. Operated by the Norwegian State Railways, it runs at a fixed hourly headway‚Äîwith additional rush-hour services‚Äîbetween Lerkendal Station in Trondheim and Steinkjer, calling at 13 stations on the Hell‚ÄìSunnan Line. Travel time from Steinkjer is 24 minutes to Verdal, 37 minutes to Levanger, 1 hour and 24 minutes to Stj√∏rdal and 2 hours and 4 minutes to Trondheim. The services are operated with Class 92 diesel multiple units. NSB also operates intercity services from Trondheim to Bod√∏ on the Nordland Line. These consist of two daily through trains, one day and one night service, with an additional service between Trondheim and Mo i Rana. Stj√∏rdal and Steinkjer are the only stations along the line which remain manned. NSB uses a combination of Class 93 diesel multiple units and Di 4-hauled trains. CargoNet and Cargolink operate freight trains along the line. CargoNet hauls using Vossloh Euro, while Cargolink uses Di 6 locomotives, respectively. Future Politicians have signalized that they want to electrify the tracks from Trondheim to Steinkjer along with the Mer√•ker Line. NSB will need to replace the Class 92 trains towards the end the 2010s, and want to coordinate the new stock with electrification. The county municipalities of Nord-Tr√∏ndelag and S√∏r-Tr√∏ndelag proposed during the early 2000s that the Nordland Line between Trondheim and Steinkjer be upgraded reduce travel time to one hour. This would require the average speed to be increased to , mainly through a modernization of the existing line. Specific projects include electrification, double track between Trondheim and Trondheim Airport, additional passing loops, a new bridge over Stj√∏rdalselva and a rearrangement of the tracks at Hell. This would have to be combined with a reduction in the number of stops. The National Rail Administration estimates that the mentioned investments, which would cost between NOK 4 and 6 billion, will allow a travel time of one hour and ten minutes. If a number of curves are straightened, increased capacity is introduced between Stj√∏rdal and Steinkjer and a further number of stops are removed, travel time could be reduced to one hour. Norsk Bane, a lobbyist organization which is suggesting to build a high-speed line from Oslo to Trondheim and onwards to Steinkjer, have proposed building an all-new right-of-way on the route. They estimate that regional trains would, with their infrastructure, be able to operate trains from Steinkjer to Trondheim in 40 minutes. The proposals involves only keeping the stations at Trondheim Airport, Stj√∏rdal, √Ösen, Levanger, Verdal, R√∏ra and Steinkjer along the Hell‚ÄìSunnan segment. It would involve three services per hour and direct trains to Oslo, with speeds up to .

The ORCCE regards itself as a Catholic church of the Western tradition following the Roman Rite. It has fellowship with other ecclesiastical bodies internationally through inter- communion agreements and international ecumenical bodies; the World Council of Churches through the International Council of Community Churches). The church's apostolic succession is through Arnold Harris Mathew's lineage and traced back to Roman Catholic bishops. Beliefs The Church holds the Nicene Creed and believes the summit of its worship is the Eucharist. It also holds that the Church is one even though it is manifested in many places, according to Orthodox tradition. Thus, within the ORCCE individual churches retain their autonomy in self-governance, but subscribe to the same basic understanding of the church and of the faith as a communion expressing \\"one Church.\\" The proclaims its belief \\"in unity in diversity\\". As a result, greater liberty of belief and practice are found in its churches than in the or the Eastern Orthodox churches. For example, some within the church hold to the Roman dogmatic definition of the Immaculate Conception, others regard it as a doctrine worthy of pious belief but not necessary to believe for salvation and may hold to a more Orthodox understanding of the nature of Mary; but all member churches commemorate the Feast of the Conception whether as a holy day of obligation or not. Old Roman Catholics often refer to an excerpt from Vincent of L√©rins' ': \\"all possible care must be taken, that we hold that faith which has been believed everywhere, always, by all.\\" as a basis for discerning and For this reason the ORCCE is different from the Utrecht Union (UU) and it neither ordains women nor condones same-gender marriage.  Mission  The mission of the church: #Theological preservation: to preserve and continue the orthodox Catholic Faith according to the principles found in Scripture, Tradition and Reason. \\"Real theological reform should consist in communicating to all men the teachings of Jesus Christ, as they are collected in the Scriptures and recorded in the universal tradition of the Church - a tradition, which also belongs to all the members of the Church. It is the duty of pastors and scholars to explain them, and it is the duty of each member to study the explanation, which appear to them wisest and most useful.\\" #Ecclesiastical reform: Old Roman Catholics are attempting to restore true conceptions of pastor, bishop, synod, council, ecclesiastical authority, and even infallibility according to ancient traditions. \\"The Church has been called from its very beginning a simple 'church' and it has been regarded in its universality, since the time when the question of universality arose, as a Christian 'republic'. The episcopal see of Rome was not long in attaining a certain priority. Rome being the capital of the empire; but it was merely a priority of honour, and not of jurisdiction.\\" #Union of the Christian Churches: A better understanding generally has already been reached as to the respects in which the Christian Churches ought to be one, and those in which they ought to remain distinct and all. \\"When all are one in loving one another, in working together for the social well-being, in banishing from their theology every trace of anthropomorphism and politics, in becoming more spiritually-minded after the pattern of Christ, and in establishing the reign of God in every individual conscience, then the union in question will be very near being declared.\\"  History  In the late 1990s a group of mainly disaffected Anglo-Catholic clergy and laity, disappointed with the then small growth of the Continuing Anglican movement in Great Britain and ignorant of the pre-existing Old Roman Catholic presence in the United Kingdom, approached the Old Catholic Church of the United States (OCCUSA) under the primacy of Archbishop Robert Gubala, petitioning for the creation of a missionary province to re-establish an Old Catholic presence in the United Kingdom. In 2000, after the Rt Revd Robert McBride was consecrated, the English Catholic Church (ECC) became autonomous and in communion with OCCUSA. In 2006, the English Catholic Church changed its name to the Old Catholic Church in Europe (OCCE) and was led by Bishop Dennis Beevers. The OCCE was incorporated in 2006 in the United Kingdom and dissolved in 2009. In 2009 the dissolved changed its name to the Old Roman Catholic Church in Europe (ORCCE). The church was incorporated in 2011 in the United Kingdom. The ORCCE was received into full communion with the Old Roman Catholic Church, Latin Rite, under Archbishop Boniface Grosvold, in 2011. Fr. Jerome Lloyd was consecrated to lead the jurisdiction. The ORCCE is no longer in communion with the Old Roman Catholic Church, Latin Rite. The Old Roman Catholic Church in Europe, but not the OCCE, is in communion with the Old Catholic Church of America (OCCA), but not with the OCCUSA, which is a different denomination. Ecumenical relations The ORCCE does not regard itself as the sole expression of traditional Old Roman Catholicism in Western Europe and has relations and dialogue with similar traditionalist Old Catholic and Independent Catholic jurisdictions internationally. Remaining true to the Declaration of Utrecht, the ORCCE feels that the possibility of reunion with the Holy See would require discussion and agreement on the understanding and practice of the Petrine Ministry necessarily different from that promulgated as dogma by the Roman Church during the First Vatican Council. Current state The Most Revd Msgr Jerome Lloyd OSJV, Metropolitan of Europe (UK) and Archbishop of Archdiocese of Britannia serves as the head of the church. Members of the church's clergy believe that there is a need for the pastoral care of people those who wish the Tridentine Mass in Latin or in the vernacular. The ORCCE predominantly uses the Gregorian Rite, often referred to as the Tridentine Rite, for the occasional offices as well as the 1570 Breviary and Mass with pre-1955 rubrics e.g. the traditional Rites of Holy Week without the alterations instituted by Pius XII. The church's mission in Brighton, UK, broadcasts Masses daily over the internet for those unable to attend a service physically.

It is a member of the international association of United Bible Societies, which currently involves 145 national institutions of similar kind. The main task of the Ukrainian Bible Society is to translate, publish and distribute the Bible and its portions. The Bible Society in Ukraine began its work in 1815 as a network of several affiliates to the Russian Bible Society. After a long period of Soviet regime restrictions, the Ukrainian Bible Society was re-established in 1991. Among its founders were the All-Ukrainian Union of Evangelical Christian- Baptist Church, the All-Ukrainian Union of Evangelical Christians (Pentecostal), Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, Ukrainian Orthodox Church - Kyiv Patriarchate, and the Seventh-day Adventist Church. Later they were joined by the Lutheran Church, Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church, Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate), Roman Catholic Church in Ukraine.Ukrainian Bible Society official web-site Yakiv Dukhonchenko was the first President of the Ukrainian Bible Society beginning in 1991. Hryhoriy Komendant is carrying out the Presidential responsibilities at the present time (since 2007). The Organization has four branches in Kyiv (Central branch), Kherson (Southern branch), Kharkiv (Eastern branch) and Lviv (Western branch). There is also a special department for Bible translation into modern Ukrainian language led by Father Rafail Turkoniak.

Later in the 17-19th centuries, when the Ukrainian territory was a part of the Russian Empire, several other translations were made secretly because of the Russian Government restrictions on Ukrainian language. At present there are several translations of Holy Scripture into Ukrainian done : * 1903 Panteleimon Kulish translation; (Ukrainian: –ü–µ—Ä–µ–∫–ª–∞–¥ –ö—É–ª—ñ—à–∞). * 1957 Ivan Khomenko translation; (–ü–µ—Ä–µ–∫–ª–∞–¥ –•–æ–º–µ–Ω–∫–∞) Rome.

It has been located at 5, Carlton House Terrace since 1965. History The Turf Club was founded in 1861 as the Arlington Club, with premises in Bennett Street, Piccadilly.Nevill, op. cit., p. 218 It was while there that a committee of the Arlington, consisting of George Bentinck, Sir Rainald Knightley, Charles C. Greville, H. B. Mayne, John Bushe, G. Payne, and Colonel Pipon, under the chairmanship of John Clay MP, drew up the laws of whist, officially sanctioned by the Portland Club in 1864.Nevill, op. cit., p. 181 Members had originally wished to call themselves simply The Club until it was discovered that they had been beaten to it: a hundred years or so earlier the name had been claimed by Dr Johnson and Sir Joshua Reynolds for their renowned dining society. The Turf Club moved in 1875 to the corner of Piccadilly and Clarges Street. The new building at 85 Piccadilly, designed by John Norton, remained the clubhouse for ninety years until the Club decided to sell the extremely valuable freehold.Lejeune, op. cit., p. 273 In 1965, the Turf Club moved to its current home at 5 Carlton House Terrace, SW1Y 5AQ, overlooking the Mall. Carlton House Terrace itself was designed and built by John Nash, the famous Regency architect, between 1827 and 1833. The lease on Number 5 was held by the Earls of Caledon from 1830 until 1929, and its residents included Lord Palmerston; John Hay, the U.S. Ambassador; Emerald, Lady Cunard (mother of Nancy Cunard); and Harry Gordon Selfridge, founder of Selfridges. Some quotations about the club include: : \\"There are . . . few members who are not of particularly blue blood who have succeeded in passing the portals of the Turf Club, which is a pretty close preserve for the aristocracy.\\" [1904] : \\"Probably the most exclusive club in London.\\" [1911] : \\"Socially it was extremely pleasant, the majority of the members being principally engaged in amusing themselves.\\" [1920] : \\"At the turn of the [Twentieth] century, when many clubs were forced to admit a wider range of members, the Turf remained notably exclusive. It has always been particularly well off for Dukes.\\" [1979] : \\"A younger edition of White's.\\" [1979] Lejeune, op. cit., p. 7 : \\"It is the most beautiful gentlemen's club in London and has the youngest membership.\\" [1984] In December 2008, it was reported by the Daily Mail that the Princes William and Harry, sons of the Prince of Wales, had been given membership to the club.

It is native to eastern North America where it grows in moist prairies and sedge meadows. The plants have tall spikes of purple flowers resembling bottle brushes or feathers that grow one to five feet tall. The species grows in hardiness zones 3 - 8, stretching from the Midwest to the East Coast, eastern and western Canada. Common varieties include 'Alba' and 'Floristan White' which are white-flowering cultivars on -foot (45 cm) tall spikes, 'Callilepsis' with long stems good for cut flowers, 'Floristan Violett' with a strong stem and thick, violet flower spikes preferred by florists, and 'Kobold' which stays small in size with deep purple flowers. Liatris spicata var. resinosa is found in the southern part of the species's natural range. The variable plants have only 5 or 6 flowers per head and the heads are more widely spaced on the stems; these differences are more pronounced when the plants are found in drier and coastal habitats. Cultivation Liatris spicata is a garden flower in many countries around the world, grown for its showy purple flowers (pink or white in some cultivars). They bloom in July through August or September, depending on where in their range they are located. Under cultivation it is found under many names including button snakewort, Kansas gay feather, blazing star, Liatris callilepis.http://www.shootgardening.co.uk/plant/liatris-spicata Full sun is best and well-drained soil is preferred to prevent rot, though the plants do prefer moist soil. However, the plants do not tolerate wet soil in winter. The plants can tolerant some shade as well as drought but need regular watering during the first growing season to build strong roots. Plants can be grown from corms (similar to bulbs and tubers) or from seed, or the plants can be bought at garden centres or nurseries. To grow from seed, start in early spring either indoors or outside. Germination takes 20‚Äì45 days. When leaves appear, divide in large clumps. Plants should be spaced 12-15 inches apart. Spacing allows sun and air to help with potential diseases such as stem rot (Sclerotinia sclerotiorum), leaf spots (Phyllosticta liatridis, Septoria liatridis), rusts (Coleosporium laciniariae, Puccinia liatridis), powdery mildew (Erysiphe cichoracearum), and wilt (Verticillium albo-atrum). When growing from seed, blooms do not usually appear until the second year. If amending the soil, the plants prefer soil with high levels of calcium and magnesium and low levels of potassium and phosphorus. In gardens, Liatris spicata works well planted individually, as a border, and because of its vertical form, it contrasts well with mounded and broad-leaf plants. In informal gardens, large sweeps of plantings work well. The flowers either fresh or dried work well as cut flowers and have a vanilla scent when dried.  Role in ecosystems  Liatris spicata is excellent for attracting pollinators and beneficial insects. These include butterflies such as the monarch, tiger swallowtail, clouded sulphur, orange sulphur, gray hairstreak, Aphrodite fritillary, painted lady, red admiral, and wood nymphs. The flowers attract bumblebees, digger bees (Anthophorini), long-horned bees (Melissodes spp.), leaf-cutting bees (Megachile spp.), skippers, and birds including hummingbirds. Caterpillars of the rare glorious flower moth (Schinia gloriosa) and liatris flower moth (Schinia sanguinea) feed on the flowers and seeds. Caterpillars of the liatris borer moth (Carmenta anthracipennis) bore through the plant's stems. Groundhogs, rabbits, and voles also eat the plants. Deer are less likely to eat Liatris spicata than other plants and therefore considered deer-resistant, although deer will eat almost anything when food is scarce. Medicinal uses Liatris spicata was historically used medicinally by Native Americans for its carminative, diuretic, stimulant, sudorific, and expectorant properties. In addition to these uses, the Cherokee used the plant as an analgesic for pain in the back and limbs and the Menominee used it for a \\"weak heart.\\" The root of the plant is the part most often used. Native Americans also used the plant to treat swelling, abdominal pain and spasms/colic, and snake bites. Currently, the plant is used for a sore throat by gargling an infusion, as an herbal insect repellent, and in potpourri.

Biography Paul Due was born in Kristiansand, Norway. He graduated in engineering science at Leibniz University Hannover in the years 1852‚Äì1856. After graduating, he traveled to the United States, where he was first assistant in the U.S. Coast Survey, then from 1857 to 1859 employed at the architectural office in Chicago and then in New York City, where he executed drawings for renovation of City Hall. From 1860 to 1865 he lived in Charleston, Virginia. Among other things he planned fortifications at Richmond, Virginia for the Confederacy during the American Civil War. When he returned to Norway, he designed 23 buildings in Drammen after the city was hit by the great fire in 1866. He worked with Bernhard Christoph Steckmest (1846‚Äì1926) in the firm of Due & Steckmest from 1870-1890. During this period, the firm provided plans for a number of notable buildings in Oslo. After ending their cooperation in 1890, Due worked as a railway architect for the Norwegian State Railways until 1912. During this period he designed more than 150 railway stations, including the stations at Hamar, Kristiansand, Levanger and Kornsj√∏. One of his most important buildings from this time period, the Hamar Railway Station dating from 1896, replaced former wooden buildings by architects Georg Andreas Bull and Balthazar Lange. Due was co-founder and chairman of the Norwegian Engineering and Architectural Association. He served as a member of the tax commission 1872-80, and a member of the Oslo Building Commission from 1884 to 1888. In 1907, he was a member of the evaluation committee for the competition of the Nidaros Cathedral West Front. He became an honorary member of the Society of Architects in 1899 and an honorary member of Norway's Engineering and Architectural Association in 1887.

It forms the northern edge of the Annapolis Valley along the shore of the Bay of Fundy. Together with South Mountain, the two ranges form the Annapolis Highlands region. North Mountain rises dramatically from the valley floor and tapers somewhat more gradually to the north and west where it meets the coast, although many parts of this coast have vertical cliffs rising higher than 30 metres, most notably at Cape Split. A break occurs at Digby Gut where a gap in the mountain ridge is filled by a deep tidal channel separating the eastern end of the mountain from Digby Neck. The highest point on the ridge is at Mount Rose in Annapolis County, north of Lawrencetown. Geology The ridge traces its history to the Triassic period when this part of Nova Scotia occupied the center of the supercontinent Pangaea. It is a 201 million year old sequence of tholeiitic basalts, which contains columnar jointing. The basalts also extend under the Bay of Fundy and parts of it are exposed on the shore at Five Islands, east of Parrsboro on the north side of the bay.Hot Spots and Rifts in Continental Crust Retrieved on 2007-10-15 Numerous sediment-filled fissures are present near the upper surface of North Mountain. The hard ridge of basalt resisted the grinding of ice sheets that flowed over the region during past ice ages, and now forms one side of the Annapolis Valley in western part of the Nova Scotia peninsula. North Mountain is believed to have formed during the opening of the Atlantic Ocean.North Mountain Basalt Retrieved on 2007-10-15 It is a portion of the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province, which is a gigantic flood basalt and intrusive complex along east coast of the United States, Europe, northwest Africa and South America with a diameter of 4,000 km. A viscous (<175 m) North Mountain flow at McKay Head shows ~25-cm-thick distinguished layers separated by ~130 centimeter of basalt in its upper 34 meters. Upper layers (5 meters below the lava top) are extremely vesicular while lower ones are pegmatitic and include a narrow (~2 cm) rhyolite band.

Since that time, there have been only seven individuals collected, all but one from Puerto Rico.

Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online. Available from http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9074876 (accessed April 2008) The genus classifies this flower as a beautyberry. =Physiology= Capa rose is considered a small evergreen tree or shrub. It can grow up to tall. When twigs are young, they are whitish color. The branches are tetragonal, meaning four- sided. The leaves are broad at the middle and taper to the end, somewhat of an elliptical shape that is long and wide. The leaves are a dark green on top and a lighter green beneath. The veins are raised on the bottom with whitish scurfy, and the top is smoother and shiny. The flowers are actinomorphic, or star-shaped. The petals are white and approximately wide by long. It is also hermaphroditic, having both male stamens and female pistils and ovary. There are four long stamens and one wide ovary. The berries produced are about in diameter and contain four seeds. Ripened seeds are purple, and immature seeds are white. Location =Distribution= Presently, the capa rose only exists in Puerto Rico, specifically within the Caribbean National Forest. That forest is divided into several regions of plants, and the capa rose is located in the Palo Colorado region. There were two sites reported in the Rio Blanco district of the Nauguabo municipality. Only one site was discovered in the Mameyes II district, and two sites were in the Jimenez district, both of the Rio Grande municipality. =Habitat= The Luquillo Mountains are about from the nearest shore. The mountains‚Äô highest elevation above sea level is over , with precipitation increasing at higher elevations.Lugo, A. 1994. \\"Preservation of Primary Forests in the Luquillo Mountains, Puerto Rico\\". USDA Forest Service. Conservation Biology 8: 1122-1131. Available from https://doi.org/10.1046%2Fj.1523-1739.1994.08041122.x (accessed March 2008) The palo Colorado region makes up about 17 percent of the national forest. It occurs at elevations higher than . The average annual precipitation for the palo Colorado region is from . However, the off-season for rainfall is from February to April. The humidity ranges from 90‚Äì100 percent. The mean temperature in this region is about . The capa rose grows on the slopes of the mountains, which protects it from severe wind. However, hurricanes do occur in that area from time to time. Endangerment =Causes and factors= Not only is the species extremely localized, found in only one section of one country, it is also on an island. This isolation alone causes the species to be at high risk for extinction. However, the capa rose is also facing habitat loss. Its habitat is being lost to deforestation and agriculture (World Conservation Union, 2007). Because Puerto Rico is considered United States territory, the forest habitat for the rose is managed by the USDA Forest Service. Forest management such as trails, cutting, agriculture and shelter construction all endanger the plant further. There are other factors affecting the rapid decline of the plant. There is a very low number of plants in Puerto Rico. The loss of just one plant greatly endangers its survival. The risk of the plant being collected due to its rarity and ornamental value is yet another threat, and for this reason the Forest Service did not list its habitat as critical. This would publish detailed information about the location of the plants, and possibly increase the instances of collection (Fish and Wildlife Service, 1992). The location of the capa rose also suffers a lot of damage due to hurricanes. These hurricanes wipe out existing plants and damage locations for future seedlings to develop. They are also poor reproducers and dispersers, so the protection of the individuals and habitat are all the more crucial (World Conservation Union, 2007). =Conservation efforts= The capa rose was listed as endangered in 1992.US Forest Service. 2008. \\"Threatened, Endangered, and Proposed (TEP) Plant Profile: Callicarpa ampla, capa rosa\\". US Forest Service. Available from http://www.fs.fed.us/wildflowers/rareplants/profiles/tep/callicarpa_ampla/index.shtml (accessed April 2008) The recovery plan was implemented in 1995. It outlines what actions should be taken to protect the plant from further loss and increase its population. A management plan required steps to protect the plant and its habitat. *The plant would be observed for population fluctuations and its reproduction process, as not much is known about it currently. *Restrictions would be enforced to protect the plant and its environment. This would include punishment for collecting the species. Also, all construction plans have to be approved, thus ensuring the safety of the plant's habitat. *Education for the awareness of the plant's status would help both the US government and the local government of Puerto Rico protect the plant. Distributed material will help educate in the schools, as well as allowing developers and others identify the plant and understand necessary actions. *A major part of the plant‚Äôs recovery plan is to research. As mentioned before, not much is understood about the reproduction and distribution of the species. At the time of the recovery plan, only one location of the plant‚Äôs seedlings was found. That area was separate from adult, flowering individuals. A search for other localities would be conducted in an effort to find other populations. Observations and studies of these locations will then create an understanding of the necessary criteria for the species to exist in a given environment. This will allow for better selection of introduction sites, should captive reproduction be successful. *Also, the plan includes acquiring any private land where the capa rose is found growing.

Large numbers of this tandem, two-seat, biplane were built, powered by different engines. Design and development The Ca.100 (nicknamed Caproncino, little Caproni), was based on the de Havilland DH.60 Moth, for which Caproni had a production licence. They revised the wings so that the upper wing was lightly smaller than the lower, and also redesigned the tailplane. Otherwise, its wings followed those of the Moth in having no sweep or stagger. It was a wooden-framed, fabric-covered single-engine aircraft with a square section fuselage built around four longerons, with tandem open cockpits. It had a fixed, conventional undercarriage. Fuel was carried, Moth style, in a streamlined tank on the centre section of the upper wing. It first flew in late 1928, piloted by Domenico Antonini, at Milan- Taliedo. Ca.100s were powered by a variety of engines. The most common of these were the Isotta Fraschini Asso 80R and the Colombo S.63, both six- cylinder air-cooled inline engines, and the uncowled Fiat A.50 and A.54 seven- cylinder radials. Other engines in the 60-100 kW (80-135 hp) range included the Walter NZ-85, Farini T.58, Fiat A.53, Fiat A.60 radials and the inline Colombo S.53, Cirrus Major, de Havilland Gipsy, de Havilland Gipsy Major engines. Operational history The Regia Aeronautica received two prototype and 675 production Ca.100s, built by Bergamasche, Breda, C.N.A. and Macchi as well as Caproni. 30 of the Macchi-built examples were fitted with floats and designated Ca.100 Idro. The Ca.100s were mostly used as primary trainers, though some undertook liaison work. Some aircraft were built as civilian tourers, numbering at least eight. Later they were joined on the Civil Register by retired ex-military machines. There were exports to Peru and Portugal. The design was also produced by Caproni's Bulgarian subsidiary as the KB-1 Peperuda (butterfly). Twelve Ca.100s \\"PR\\" (for Per√∫), a derivative with all-metal structure, powered by a 120 hp Kinner B-5 engine, were built under licence by the Peruvian government from 1937. One example of the Ca.100 Idro seaplane version was used to establish a world seaplane altitude record of in 1931. Survivors I-ABOU at Lake Como.

She was born on Thursday, April 19, 1894, on Hopper Street in Paterson, New Jersey. Her parents were William Veenstra, later a Christian Reformed pastor, and Cornelia Anna De Hoop. In 1915 she was challenged by Karl Kumm of the Sudan United Mission (SUM) to be a missionary in Africa. On October 2, 1919, she left New York City on the Mauretania for England; on December 31, 1919, she took another ship to Africa, arriving in Lagos in January 1920. In February 1921, she arrived at her station in Lupwe, which is near Takum, now in Taraba State. Two years later Johanna Veenstra assumed leadership of the work in Lupwe. She was engaged primarily in medical work and in preaching. During her ministry in Lupwe, a number of people especially of the Kuteb people became Christian and also became more educated. The roots of the Christian Reformed Church of Nigeria (CRCN) and the Reform Church of Christ in Nigeria (RCCN) Headquarters in Takum, Taraba State Nigeria lay in part in the work of Johanna Veenstra. In March 1933 Johanna Veenstra became ill. She traveled to the Sudan United Mission hospital in Vom, which is in present-day Plateau State. On Palm Sunday, April 9, 1933, Johanna Veenstra died and was buried in Vom. In addition to her missionary work in Nigeria, Johanna Veenstra is significant for presenting the mission needs of Nigeria to the Christian Reformed Church. In 1940 this church adopted Nigeria as a mission field. Today the Christian Reformed Church of Nigeria is a strong independent African church. The seminary of the CRCN, Veenstra Seminary located in Donga, is named after Johanna Veenstra. Select bibliography *Beets, Henry. Johanna of Nigeria.

The daily workshops were supplemented by evening keynote addresses and musical and theatrical entertainment. In recent years, sub-conferences such as the \\"Consortium for the Future of the Jewish Family\\" ran concurrently with the CAJE conference. The first CAJE conference was held in August 1976 at Brown University. Around 350 people attended. Due to its size and nature, the CAJE conference was generally held on a university campus.

It is found on three islands in the Caribbean. There are fewer than 250 individuals total divided amongst the islands of Vieques in Puerto Rico, St. John in the United States Virgin Islands, and Virgin Gorda in the British Virgin Islands. It has been extirpated from the wild on Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands, where it was first described in 1855, and now only grows there in cultivation.Clubbe, C., et al. 2003. Calyptranthes thomasiana. 2006 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Downloaded on 25 January 2011. The plant is a member of the islands' montane flora. It occurs on one mountain peak on each of the three islands: Monte Pirata on Vieques, Bordeaux Mountain on St. John, and Gorda Peak on Virgin Gorda.Silander, S. Recovery Plan for Calyptranthes thomasiana. USFWS. September 30, 1997. Its natural habitat is dry to moist forests. This is an evergreen shrub or small tree which can reach 10 meters in height. The oppositely arranged leaves have oval blades 2 to 4 centimeters long which are shiny green and glandular. The flowers have four spoon-shaped petals. The plant is perhaps naturally rare, but habitat loss has contributed to its decline. The Vieques population is located on land formerly owned by the United States Navy and now part of Vieques National Wildlife Refuge.Vieques NWR Fact Sheet, USFWS. Last accessed January 2011. It occurs at the highest elevation on the island, 300 meters, amongst orchids and bromeliads. There are only 10 to 12 individuals known from this area, and although the threat of damage from Navy activity is gone today, the plant is still vulnerable to extirpation from any one severe event, such as a hurricane. Hurricane Hugo caused forest damage in 1989, for example. On St. John it also occupies the highest mountain peak at an elevation around 380 meters. There are about 100 individuals in this area, which is within the bounds of Virgin Islands National Park. They do face threats from activity on nearby roads, and from feral pigs, donkeys, and goats. Deforestation was cited as a main reason for the plant's being added to the endangered species list of the United States.USFWS.

Siege of Mafeking correspondent The Daily Mail newspaper recruited Lady Sarah after one of its correspondents, Ralph Hellawell, was arrested by the Boers as he tried to get out of the besieged town of Mafeking to send his dispatch. She was in the right place at the right time to step into the journalistic breach, having moved to Mafeking with her husband, Lt.-Col. Gordon Chesney Wilson, at the start of the war, where he was aide-de-camp to Col. Robert Baden-Powell, the commanding officer at Mafeking. Baden-Powell asked her to leave Mafeking for her own safety after the Boers threatened to storm the British garrison. This she duly did, and set off on a madcap adventure in the company of her maid, travelling through the South African countryside.Sarah Wilson, South African Memories Social, Warlike & Sporting From Diaries Written At The Time, Chapter VI. Accessed 5 September 2015. Eventually, she was captured by the Boers and returned to the town in exchange for a horse thief being held there.Wilson, chapters IX and X. When she re-entered Mafeking, she found it had not been attacked as predicted. Instead, over of trenches had been dug and 800 bomb shelters built to protect residents from the constant shelling of the town.Wilson, chapters XI and XII. During her stay in the city, she also helped with nursing in a convalescent hospital, and was slightly wounded when it was shelled by Boer forces in late January 1900. Three soldiers talk with Sarah Wilson in Mafeking. She is seated by the door to her bomb shelter. On 26 March 1900, toward the end of the siege, she wrote: Lady Sarah Wilson during the Siege of Mafeking during the Second Boer War Although death and destruction surrounded her, the Mail‚Äôs fledgling war correspondent preferred not to dwell too much on the horrors of the siege. She described cycling events held on Sundays and the town‚Äôs celebration of Colonel Baden-Powell‚Äôs birthday, which was declared a holiday. Despite these cheery events, dwindling food supplies became a constant theme in the stories she sent back to the Mail and the situation seemed hopeless when the garrison was hit by an outbreak of malarial typhoid. In this weakened state the Boers managed to penetrate the outskirts of the town, but the British stood firm and repelled the assault.Wilson, chapter XIII. The siege finally ended after 217 days, when the Royal Horse and Canadian Artillery galloped into Mafeking on 17 May 1900. Only a few people standing in a dusty road, singing \\"Rule, Britannia!\\", were there to greet their saviours. But in London it was a different scene as more than 20,000 people turned out in the streets to celebrate the relief of Mafeking.The boisterous celebration ensuing from the lifting of the siege created the word, to maffick, for extravagant and public celebrations).See Pall Mall Gaz. 21 May 2/2 \\"We trust Cape Town..will ‚Äòmaffick‚Äô to-day, if we may coin a word, as we at home did on Friday and Saturday.\\" Complete definition: \\"To celebrate uproariously, rejoice extravagantly, esp. on an occasion of national celebration (originally the relief of the British garrison besieged in Mafeking (now Mafikeng), South Africa, in May 1900).

It was created on 15 February 1828 for Vice-Admiral Robert Ricketts. The second Baronet was an admiral in the Royal Navy and appointed High Sheriff of Leicestershire in 1851. He married, firstly, Henrietta Plumbe Tempest in 1834, and, secondly, Lady Caroline Augusta Pelham-Clinton, daughter of Henry Pelham-Clinton, 4th Duke of Newcastle in 1852. The 3rd Baronet (only child of Henrietta Plumbe Tempest) inherited in 1884 the assets of wealthier aunt and uncle Catherine and Thomas Plumbe-Tempest and assumed by Royal licence the same year the surname of Tempest; thus borne by his son and daughter, who re- assumed it as a condition of her unmarried brother's Will. Tempest and associated wealth would not pass to the 5th baronets onwards, as the 5th was the younger brother of the 3rd baronet. This stands as the only passing of the title into a junior branch.

The earliest records traces back to the efforts of Roman legislators to control price fluctuations and unfair trade practices. Throughout the Middle Ages in Europe, kings and queens repeatedly cracked down on monopolies, including those created through state legislation. The English common law doctrine of restraint of trade became the precursor to modern competition law. This grew out of the codifications of United States antitrust statutes, which in turn had considerable influence on the development of European Community competition laws after the Second World War. Increasingly, the focus has moved to international competition enforcement in a globalised economy. Early history Laws governing competition law are found in over two millennia of history. Roman Emperors and Mediaeval monarchs alike used tariffs to stabilise prices or support local production. The formal study of \\"competition\\", began in earnest during the 18th century with such works as Adam Smith's The Wealth of Nations. Different terms were used to describe this area of the law, including \\"restrictive practices\\", \\"the law of monopolies\\", \\"combination acts\\" and the \\"restraint of trade\\". =Roman legislation= The earliest surviving example of modern competition law's ancestors appears in the Lex Julia de Annona, enacted during the Roman Republic around 50 BC.This is Julius Caesar's time according to Babled in De La Cure Annone chez le Romains To protect the corn trade, heavy fines were imposed on anyone directly, deliberately and insidiously stopping supply ships.Wilberforce (1966) p.20 Under Diocletian, in 301 AD an Edict on maximum prices established a death penalty for anyone violating a tariff system, for example by buying up, concealing or contriving the scarcity of everyday goods. The most legislation came under the Constitution of Zeno of 483 AD which can be traced into Florentine Municipal laws of 1322 and 1325.Wilberforce (1966) p.22 It provided for property confiscation and banishment for any trade combinations or joint action of monopolies private or granted by the Emperor. Zeno rescinded all previously granted exclusive rights.Wilberforce (1966) p.21 Justinian I also introduced legislation not long after to pay officials to manage state monopolies. As Europe slipped into the Dark Ages, so did the records of law making until the Middle Ages brought greater expansion of trade in the time of lex mercatoria. =Middle ages= Edward III during the Black Death enacted the Statute of Labourers to cap wages, and provide double damages against infringers Legislation in England to control monopolies and restrictive practices were in force well before the Norman Conquest. The Domesday Book recorded that \\"foresteel\\" (i.e. forestalling, the practice of buying up goods before they reached market and then inflating the prices) was one of three forfeitures that King Edward the Confessor could carry out through England.Pollock and Maitland, History of English Law Vol. II, 453 Concern for fair prices also led to attempts to directly regulate the market. Under Henry III, an Act was passed in 126651 & 52 Hen. 3, Stat. 1 to fix bread and ale prices in correspondence with corn prices laid down by the assizes. Penalties for breach included amercements, pillory and tumbrel.51 & 52 Hen. 3, Stat. 6 A fourteenth century statute labelled forestallers as \\"oppressors of the poor and the community at large and enemies of the whole country.\\"Wilberforce (1966) p.23 Under King Edward III, the Statute of Labourers of 134923 Edw. 3. fixed wages of artificers and workmen and decreed that foodstuffs should be sold at reasonable prices. On top of existing penalties, the statute stated that overcharging merchants must pay the injured party double the sum they received, an idea that has been replicated in punitive treble damages under US antitrust law. Also under Edward III, the following statutory provision in the poetic language of the time outlawed trade combinations.27 Edw. 3, Stat. 2, c. 25 > \\"...we have ordained and established, that no merchant or other shall make > Confederacy, Conspiracy, Coin, Imagination, or Murmur, or Evil Device in any > point that may turn to the Impeachment, Disturbance, Defeating or Decay of > the said Staples, or of anything that to them pertaineth, or may pertain.\\" Examples of legislation in Europe include the constitutiones juris metallici by Wenceslas II of Bohemia between 1283 and 1305, condemning combinations of ore traders increasing prices; the Municipal Statutes of Florence in 1322 and 1325 followed Zeno's legislation against state monopolies; and under Emperor Charles V in the Holy Roman Empire a law was passed \\"to prevent losses resulting from monopolies and improper contracts which many merchants and artisans made in the Netherlands.\\" In 1553 King Henry VIII reintroduced tariffs for foodstuffs, designed to stabilise prices in the face of fluctuations in supply from overseas. The legislation read here that whereas, > \\"it is very hard and difficult to put certain prices to any such things... > [it is necessary because] prices of such victuals be many times enhanced and > raised by the Greedy Covetousness and Appetites of the Owners of such > Victuals, by occasion of ingrossing and regrating the same, more than upon > any reasonable or just ground or cause, to the great damage and > impoverishing of the King's subjects.\\"25 Hen. 8, c. 2. Around this time, organisations representing various tradesmen and handicraftspeople, known as guilds had been established and enjoyed many concessions and exemptions from the laws against monopolies. The privileges conferred were not abolished until the Municipal Corporations Act 1835. =Renaissance developments= Elizabeth I assured monopolies would not be abused in the early era of globalisation Europe around the 15th century was changing quickly. The new world had just been opened up, overseas trade and plunder was pouring wealth through the international economy and attitudes among businessmen were shifting. In 1561, a system of Industrial Monopoly Licences, similar to modern patents had been introduced into England. But by the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, the system was reputedly much abused and used merely to preserve privileges, encouraging nothing new in the way of innovation or manufacture.according to William Searle Holdsworth, 4 Holdsworth, 3rd ed., Chap. 4 p. 346 When a protest was made in the House of Commons and a Bill was introduced, the Queen convinced the protesters to challenge the case in the courts. This was the catalyst for the Case of Monopolies or Darcy v Allin.(1602) 11 Co. Rep. 84b The plaintiff, an officer of the Queen's household, had been granted the sole right of making playing cards and claimed damages for the defendant's infringement of this right. The court found the grant void and that three characteristics of monopoly were (1) price increases (2) quality decrease (3) the tendency to reduce artificers to idleness and beggary. This put a temporary end to complaints about monopoly, until King James I began to grant them again. In 1623 Parliament passed the Statute of Monopolies, which for the most part excluded patent rights from its prohibitions, as well as the guilds. From King Charles I, through the civil war and to King Charles II, monopolies continued, and were considered especially useful for raising revenue.e.g. one John Manley paid ¬£10,000 p.a. from 1654 to the Crown for a tender on the \\"postage of letters both inland and foreign\\" Wilberforce (1966) p. 18 Then in 1684, in East India Company v Sandys(1685) 10 St. Tr. 371 it was decided that exclusive rights to trade only outside the realm were legitimate on the grounds that only large and powerful concerns could trade in the conditions prevailing overseas. In 1710, to deal with high coal prices caused by a Newcastle Coal Monopoly, the New Law was passed.9 Anne, c. 30 Its provisions stated that \\"all and every contract or contracts, Covenants and Agreements, whether the same be in writing or not in writing...[between] persons whatsoever concerned the said Coal trade, for Ingrossing Coals, or for restraining or hindering any Person or Persons whomsoever from freely... disposing of Coals.... are hereby declared to be illegal.\\" When Adam Smith wrote the Wealth of Nations in 1776Adam Smith, An Enquiry into the Wealth of Nations (1776) he was somewhat cynical of the possibility for change. > \\"To expect indeed that freedom of trade should ever be entirely restored in > Great Britain is as absurd as to expect that Oceana or Utopia should ever be > established in it. Not only the prejudices of the public, but what is more > unconquerable, the private interests of many individuals irresistibly oppose > it. The Member of Parliament who supports any proposal for strengthening > this Monopoly is seen to acquire not only the reputation for understanding > trade, but great popularity and influence with an order of men whose members > and wealth render them of great importance.\\" =Restraint of trade= Coke in the 17th century thought that general restraints on trade were unreasonable. The English law of restraint of trade is the direct predecessor to modern competition law.\\"the modern common law of England [has] passed directly into the legislation and thereafter into the judge-made law of the United States.\\" Wilberforce (1966) p.7 Its current use is small, given modern and economically oriented statutes in most common law countries. Its approach was based on the two concepts of prohibiting agreements that ran counter to public policy, unless the reasonableness of an agreement could be shown. A restraint of trade is simply some kind of agreed provision that is designed to restrain another's trade. For example, in Nordenfelt v Maxim, Nordenfelt Gun CoNordenfelt v Maxim, Nordenfelt Gun Co [1894] AC 535 a Swedish arms inventor promised on sale of his business to an American gun maker that he \\"would not make guns or ammunition anywhere in the world, and would not compete with Maxim in any way.\\" To consider whether or not there is a restraint of trade in the first place, both parties must have provided valuable consideration for their agreement. In Dyer's case(1414) 2 Hen. 5, 5 Pl. 26 a dyer had given a bond not to exercise his trade in the same town as the plaintiff for six months but the plaintiff had promised nothing in return. On hearing the plaintiff's attempt to enforce this restraint, Hull J exclaimed: > \\"per Dieu, if the plaintiff were here, he should go to prison until he had > paid a fine to the King.\\" The common law has evolved to reflect changing business conditions. So in the 1613 case of Rogers v ParryRogers v Parry (1613) 2 Bulstr. 136; (1613) 79 ER 278 a court held that a joiner who promised not to trade from his house for 21 years could have this bond enforced against him since the time and place was certain. It was also held that a man cannot bind himself to not use his trade generally by Chief Justice Coke. This was followed in Broad v JolyffeBroad v Jolyffe (1620) Cro. Jac. 596 and Mitchel v ReynoldsMitchel v Reynolds (1711) 1 P.Wms. 181 where Lord Macclesfield asked, \\"What does it signify to a tradesman in London what another does in Newcastle?\\" In times of such slow communications, commerce around the country it seemed axiomatic that a general restraint served no legitimate purpose for one's business and ought to be void. But already in 1880 in Roussillon v RoussillonRoussillon v Roussillon (1880) 14 ChD 351 Lord Justice Fry stated that a restraint unlimited in space need not be void, since the real question was whether it went further than necessary for the promisee's protection. So in the Nordenfelt case case Lord McNaughton rule that while one could validly promise to \\"not make guns or ammunition anywhere in the world\\" it was and unreasonable restraint to \\"not compete with Maxim in any way.\\" This approach in England was confirmed by the House of Lords in Mason v The Provident Supply and Clothing CoMason v The Provident Supply and Clothing Co. [1913] AC 724 Modern age Modern competition law begins with the United States legislation of the Sherman Act of 1890 and the Clayton Act of 1914. While other, particularly European, countries also had some form of regulation on monopolies and cartels, the U.S. codification of the common law position on restraint of trade had a widespread effect on subsequent competition law development. Both after World War II and after the fall of the Berlin wall, competition law has gone through phases of renewed attention and legislative updates around the world. =United States antitrust= Standard Oil was one of the greatest companies to be broken up under United States antitrust laws The American term anti-trust arose not because the U.S. statutes had anything to do with ordinary trust law, but because the large American corporations used trusts to conceal the nature of their business arrangements. Big trusts became synonymous with big monopolies, the perceived threat to democracy and the free market these trusts represented led passage of the Sherman and Clayton Acts. These laws, in part, codified past American and English common law of restraints of trade. Senator Hoar, an author of the Sherman Act said in a debate, \\"We have affirmed the old doctrine of the common law in regard to all inter-state and international commercial transactions and have clothed the United States courts with authority to enforce that doctrine by injunction.\\" Evidence of the common law basis of the Sherman and Clayton Acts is found in Standard Oil of New Jersey v. United States,221 U.S. 1 (1911) where Chief Justice White explicitly linked the Sherman Act with the common law and sixteenth-century English statutes on engrossing.e.g. Under King Edward VI in 1552, 5 & 6 Edw. 6, c. 14 The Act's wording also reflects common law. The first two sections read as follows, > \\"Section 1. Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, > or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, > or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal. Every person who shall > make any contract or engage in any combination or conspiracy hereby declared > to be illegal shall be deemed guilty of a felony, and, on conviction > thereof, shall be punished by fine.... > Section 2. Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or > combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to monopolize any part > of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, > shall be deemed guilty of a felony, and, on conviction thereof, shall be > punished by fine....\\" The Sherman Act did not have the immediate effects its authors intended, although Republican President Theodore Roosevelt's federal government sued 45 companies, and William Taft used it against 75 companies. The Clayton Act of 1914 was passed to supplement the Sherman Act. Specific categories of abusive conduct were listed, including price discrimination(section 2), exclusive dealings (section 3) and mergers which substantially lessened competition (section 7). Section 6 exempted trade unions from the law's operation. Both the Sherman and Clayton Acts are now codified under Title 15 of the United States Code. *United States v. Workingmen's Amalgamated Council, 54 Fed 994 (CCA 5th 1893) *United States v. E. C. Knight Company, 156 U.S. 1 (1895) *United States v. Trans-Missouri Freight Association, 166 U.S. 290 (1897) *Northern Securities Co. v. United States, 193 U.S. 197 (1904) *Loewe v. Lawlor, 208 U.S. 274 (1908) *Duplex Printing Press Co. v. Deering, 254 U.S. 443 (1921) =Post war consensus= It was after the First World War that countries began to follow the United States' lead in competition policy. In 1923, Canada introduced the Combines Investigation Act and in 1926 France reinforced its basic competition provisions from the 1810 Code Napoleon. After World War II, the Allies, led by the United States, introduced tight regulation of cartels and monopolies in occupied Germany and Japan. In Germany, despite the existence of laws against unfair business practices and unfair competition passed in 1909 (Gesetz gegen den unlauteren Wettbewerb or UWG) it was widely believed that the predominance of large cartels of German industry had made it easier for the Nazis to assume total economic control simply by bribing or blackmailing the heads of a small number of industrial magnates. Similarly in Japan, where business was organised along family and nepotistic ties, the zaibatsu were easy for the government to manipulate into the war effort. Following World War II and the unconditional surrender of Japan and Germany, tighter controls, replicating the existing American policies and regulations were introduced. However, further developments were considerably overshadowed by the move towards nationalisation and industry- wide planning in many countries. Making the economy and industry democratically accountable through direct government action became a priority. Coal industry, railroads, steel, electricity, water, health care and many other sectors were targeted for their special qualities of being natural monopolies. Commonwealth countries were slow in enacting statutory competition law provisions. The United Kingdom introduced the (considerably less stringent) Restrictive Practices Act in 1956. Australia introduced its current Trade Practices Act in 1974. Recently however there has been a wave of updates, especially in Europe to harmonise legislation with contemporary competition law thinking. =European Union law= In 1957 six Western European countries signed the Treaty of the European Community (EC Treaty or Treaty of Rome), which over the last fifty years has grown into a European Union of nearly half a billion citizens. The European Community is the name for the economic and social pillar of EU law, under which competition law falls. Healthy competition is seen as an essential element in the creation of a common market free from restraints on trade. The first provision is Article 81 EC, which deals with cartels and restrictive vertical agreements. Prohibited are... > \\"(1) ...all agreements between undertakings, decisions by associations of > undertakings and concerted practices which may affect trade between Member > States and which have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction > or distortion of competition within the common market...\\" Article 81(1) EC then gives examples of \\"hard core\\" restrictive practices such as price fixing or market sharing and 81(2) EC confirms that any agreements are automatically void. However, just like the Statute of Monopolies 1623, Article 81(3) EC creates exemptions, if the collusion is for distributional or technological innovation, gives consumers a \\"fair share\\" of the benefit and does not include unreasonable restraints (or disproportionate, in ECJ terminology) that risk eliminating competition anywhere. Article 82 EC deals with monopolies, or more precisely firms who have a dominant market share and abuse that position. Unlike U.S. Antitrust, EC law has never been used to punish the existence of dominant firms, but merely imposes a special responsibility to conduct oneself appropriately. Specific categories of abuse listed in Article 82 EC include price discrimination and exclusive dealing, much the same as sections 2 and 3 of the U.S. Clayton Act. Also under Article 82 EC, the Council of the European Union was empowered to enact a regulation to control mergers between firms, currently the latest known by the abbreviation of ECMR \\"Reg. 139/2004\\". The general test is whether a concentration (i.e. merger or acquisition) with a community dimension (i.e. affects a number of EU member states) might significantly impede effective competition. Again, the similarity to the Clayton Act's substantial lessening of competition. Finally, Articles 86 and 87 EC regulate the state's role in the market. Article 86(2) EC states clearly that nothing in the rules can be used to obstruct a member state's right to deliver public services, but that otherwise public enterprises must play by the same rules on collusion and abuse of dominance as everyone else. Article 87 EC, similar to Article 81 EC, lays down a general rule that the state may not aid or subsidise private parties in distortion of free competition, but then grants exceptions for things like charities, natural disasters or regional development. =International enforcement= Competition law has already been substantially internationalised along the lines of the US model by nation states themselves, however the involvement of international organisations has been growing. Increasingly active at all international conferences are the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which is prone to making neo-liberal recommendations about the total application of competition law for public and private industries.see, Tony Prosser, The Limits of Competition Law (2005) ch.1 Chapter 5 of the post war Havana Charter contained an Antitrust codesee a speech by Wood, The Internationalisation of Antitrust Law: Options for the Future 3 February 1995, at http://www.usdoj.gov/atr/public/speeches/future.txt but this was never incorporated into the WTO's forerunner, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1947. Office of Fair Trading Director and Professor Richard Whish wrote sceptically that it \\"seems unlikely at the current stage of its development that the WTO will metamorphose into a global competition authority.\\"Whish (2003) p.448 Despite that, at the ongoing Doha round of trade talks for the World Trade Organization, discussion includes the prospect of competition law enforcement moving up to a global level. While it is incapable of enforcement itself, the newly established International Competition Networksee, http://www.internationalcompetitionnetwork.org/ (ICN) is a way for national authorities to coordinate their own enforcement activities.

An ancient mine, it has seen production for over 400 years, and extends almost two and a half miles across and down and has mined over 40 lodes. Evidence of mining activity in South Crofty has been dated back to 1592, with full-scale mining beginning in the mid-17th century. The mine went into serious decline after 1985 and eventually closed in 1998. An effort to reopen the mine under new management is still underway as of October 2017. History South Crofty Mine, at Pool between Camborne and Redruth, is an ancient tin mine. For several centuries its shallow workings exploited copper rather than the deeper tin mineralisation. References implying mining, rather than streaming, occur in the area as early as 1592, and clearly by the mid-17th century mining was well established. During this period part of the mine which today is known as South Crofty was then called Penhellick Vean. The first really significant developments came in 1710 when Francis Bassett obtained a lease of Penhellick Vean and a drainage adit was begun. Over the next twenty years these shallow workings (less than deep) produced copper of great value and made the fortune of the Bassett family. Following the opening of the numerous copper mines on Anglesey, which occurred in the 1770-1780 period, most of the mines around South Crofty closed down. =19th century= By 1822, copper ore was being raised at a new mine in the area, East Wheal Crofty, which by 1833 included Penhellick Vean. Mining depths were now or more, and throughout the 1830s a substantial investment was undertaken to improve the mine including a rail link; so much that by 1842 East Wheal Crofty was regarded as a 'model' mine. This state of affairs did not last however, and by 1863 part of the property was for sale. The remainder of the mine, now at least deep, was renamed South Wheal Crofty which, with the deletion of 'Wheal', has been the name ever since.For information on the mines known as East, North and South Wheal Crofty in the 19th century, see T. A. Morrison, Cornwall's Central Mines. The Northern District, 1810-1895 (Penzance: Alison Hodge, 1980), pp. 256-284. The mine now faced one of its most far-reaching changes. In the 1860s, South Wheal Crofty was still almost entirely a copper mine but by 1873, after a substantial investment in new dressing machinery, the mine was - financially at least - dependent upon tin. Copper remained significant until 1880, when shallow reserves were exhausted. The mine was now operating at the level, where only tin was found. The collapse of the tin price affected South Wheal Crofty both directly (loss of revenue) and indirectly, via increased pumping costs as neighbouring mines closed down. In February 1896 mining was suspended and the mine flooded. In 1899, further backing was obtained and South Crofty gradually reopened, and acquired the adjacent New Cooks Kitchen mine. Improvements were made in the mine and the deepening of Robinsons Shaft commenced in 1903. The mine returned to profit and in 1906 a new era began, with the incorporation of South Crofty Limited. =20th century= By 1908, the Robinsons Shaft had been sunk to the level and work had begun on a second new shaft at New Cooks Kitchen. Increasing use was made of rock drills and, by 1910, the mine operated profitably hoisting 60,000 tons of ore annually. By 1914, the works were down to .Barton, D. B. (1963) The Mines of West Cornwall, 52 pp. For the next 70 years South Crofty continued to modernise and expand. As nearby mines closed, they were acquired by South Crofty to supplement its ore reserves at depth. The major purchase was of Dolcoath mine in 1936. Ore production, which had not exceeded 75,000 tons a year since 1906, was increased to 92,000 tons in 1959 following improvements in both mine and mill. Production exceeded 100,000 tons in 1968 for the first time. Black tin production was steady at between 500 and 800 tons a year from 1907 to 1956, excluding a break in production during the tin price slump of the early 1920s. Wolframite and arsenic was also produced at the mine, the former accounting for around 50 tons to 150 tons between 1907 and 1956, and the latter between 500 tons and 1000 tons between 1907 and 1919, declining to 100 tons by 1956.Dines, H. G. (1956) The Metalliferous Mining Region of South-West England, 326 pp. In 1967, South Crofty Ltd became a wholly owned subsidiary of Siamese Tin Syndicate Ltd and Siamese Tin's subsidiary, St Piran Ltd. This change of ownership was the start, in 1969, of a ¬£1 million programme to increase ore hoisting capacity and to make substantial improvements to the mill. By 1975 the mill was processing more than 200,000 tonnes of ore (including some from Pendarves mine) to yield around 1,500 tonnes of tin concentrate. In mid-1982, the company was acquired from St Piran by Charter Consolidated, which subsequently disposed of 40% of its holdings to Rio Tinto Zinc (RTZ). These holdings were vested in a new holding company, Wheal Crofty Holdings Ltd, with the same balance of ownership. Then in 1984 RTZ acquired Charter's 60% interest and South Crofty became part of Carnon Consolidated Ltd. In October 1985, the price of tin dropped dramatically on the world markets following the collapse of the International Tin Agreement. Carnon rationalised the operations, involving closure of the Pendarves mine which had supplied ore to the South Crofty mill. With a diminishing ore supply, this mill was progressively shut and by 1988 all South Crofty ore was trucked for processing at Wheal Jane. Robinson's 80\\" engine, South Crofty Mine Robinson's Shaft, South Crofty As well as a reduction in manpower, the mines were rationalised and a programme of modernisation, started by RTZ before the price crash, was stepped up. This was made possible by the co-operation and financial support of the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) in the form of loans for the capital improvement. The majority of this capital was put into the South Crofty mine. In addition, RTZ also provided a loan to fund the operating losses. Carnon became privately owned in June 1988 when the business and assets of the group were purchased from RTZ through a management buy-out. A trust was established for the benefit of the employees who received twenty percent of the equity. Carnon Holdings Limited, was incorporated at this time. In February 1991 the DTI stopped support of capital projects. The company substantially reduced labour costs which coupled with a small rise in the tin price allowed the mine to continue operating at a small loss. The losses were funded through the sale of surplus land and redundant assets. The mine produced about 1,900 tons of black tin in 1993 which was shipped to a smelter in Malaysia. In 1994 South Crofty was purchased by Crew Natural Resources of Canada; at this time the mines' identified and inferred reserves were expected to allow it to continue working for at least ten years. The New Roskear shaft took over from the Robinson Shaft as the secondary access shaft of access. However, after several more years of depressed tin prices, South Crofty Ltd announced in August 1997 that closure was imminent, and after further attempts at the time to keep the mine open, closure was completed by March 1998. =21st century= In March 2001, a new locally formed company named Baseresult Holdings Ltd. bought the mine with the stated aim of re-opening it. In the same year the company started refurbishment of the New Cooks Kitchen section of the mine. By 2003 an underground refurbishment of the Tuckingmill Decline and Old Engine shaft was under way, and later that year access was mined into New Cooks Kitchen Deep Adit level from the Tuckingmill Decline. The refurbishment of the New Cooks Kitchen section was completed in October 2003 and opened to the public for tours. In 2004, mining commenced at the level drilling a crosscut north from the Tuckingmill Decline to New Cooks Kitchen Shaft. In 2006, equipment from the dormant Wheal Jane processing plant was purchased, and although some of this was outdated, it was planned that some elements would be refurbished at South Crofty to be used in the new mill adjacent to the decline entrance. Local support for the mine was mixed, although nearly 2,000 people attended an Open Day in support of the mine on 8 July 2006. However others, including local councillor and former miner Mark Kaczmarek, believed that it was time to redevelop the site. A local regeneration company, CPR Regeneration, set up in 2001, actively opposed the reopening of the mine. CPR wished to develop the South Crofty site, initially for a leisure centre, but latterly for a housing and business park. In 2003, 2006, and 2007 CPR threatened Baseresult with a Compulsory Purchase Order of the site. South Crofty cited the reason for delays in re-commencing mining as the repeated demand by Cornwall Council for Review of Mineral Planning Permissions (ROMPs), which the Council first requested in 2002. After three further reviews submitted by Baseresult in 2002, 2004 and 2005, the Council finally granted permission for the mine in September 2006. One month later CPR Regeneration announced that they would be applying for a Compulsory Purchase Order, and published plans for a multimillion-pound development of including the South Crofty site. However, by March 2012, CPR Regeneration had ceased operational activity. In November 2007, a new company named Western United Mines Limited was formed to own and operate the mine. The previous owner of the mine, Baseresult Holdings Ltd. was the majority shareholder of the new company alongside Casserite LP, an investment vehicle acting for Galena Asset Management, a subsidiary of commodity trading company Trafigura. By this time the mine was employing 26 people and total capital investment to re-open the mine was forecast to reach ¬£9 million by June 2008, with the anticipation of its reopening at the end of 2009 after further investment of ¬£50 million. The owners of the mine stated that it had the \\"potential for a mining life of eighty years\\". (archived )Tin mine aims to re-open in 2009: BBC News website. Retrieved 2007-11-02 On 28 November 2007, the owners of the mine successfully challenged the regeneration plan developed by Kerrier District Council for the area around the surface workings. Crofty Developments Ltd., a partner of Western United Mines appealed to the High Court on the basis that it had not been involved in the consultation process. The price of tin increased from below $4,000/tonne in 2002 to over $17,000/tonne in March 2010,London Metal Exchange Cash Price, LME Price graph for tin and the economic viability of the South Crofty mine, with identified and inferred reserves of about 50,000 tonnes of tin (in 1994) had improved considerably. In May 2011, a Canadian company, Celeste Copper Corporation,Celeste Copper Corporation is listed on the TSX Venture Exchange in Calgary, Canada. In November 2012 the company changed its name to Celeste Mining Corp.: entered into an earn-in agreement to acquire up to a 100% interest of the property and assets of the mine. By 2012, the area covered by South Crofty extended over the setts of some 34 former mines, and Celeste Copper Corporation estimated that there were about 7.95 million tonnes of tin in the mine, valued at ¬£1.5 billion ($2.4 billion). The company said it planned to start pumping out the shallower workings in the Dolcoath section in 2013 at a cost of ¬£2.6 million. However, in November 2012, UNESCO called for a halt on work to reopen the mine until \\"an assessment had been made of the project's impact\\" because it said it had not been consulted before planning consent was granted in 2011. South Crofty is located within the Cornwall and West Devon Mining Landscape which had been designated as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 2006. In June 2013 the South Crofty site was placed into administration. In October 2015 a local newspaper again raised the idea that the mine could be reopened. In March 2016 it was revealed that the Canadian company Strongbow Exploration had acquired, from administration, a 100% interest in the South Crofty Tin Project and associated mineral rights in Cornwall. In April 2017 Strongbow announced that it has filed an NI 43-101 Technical Report and Preliminary Economic Assessment for the South Crofty mine. In October 2017, following successful water treatment trials, Strongbow announced that it had received a dewatering permit from the UK Environment Agency allowing the discharge of up to 25,000 cubic metres of treated water per day into the Red River. The granting of this permit means South Crofty is fully permitted to work towards a production decision. By early 2018 the funding was in place for the construction of a water treatment plant with work commencing that spring.https://strongbowexploration.com/site/assets/files/5223/2018-01-29_note_and_royalty.pdf Test drilling commenced in June 2020.

He founded the D'Angelico Guitars company, where other notable luthiers like Jimmy D'Aquisto served as apprentices.  Luthiery  John D‚ÄôAngelico was born in 1905 in New York to an Italian-American family, and was apprenticed in 1914 to his great-uncle, Raphael Ciani, who made violins, mandolins, and flat top guitars.Bonds, Ray (ed.)

This apprenticeship would become the basis for construction principles he later incorporated into his archtop guitars. After Ciani died D'Angelico took over the management of the business, but he didn't like having to supervise the 15 employees. As a result, he left and founded in 1932 D'Angelico Guitars at 40 Kenmare Street in Manhattan's Little Italy. Here he began making guitars initially based on the 16 inch Gibson L-5 and subsequently working on his own designs.  Instrument designs and output Initially D'Angelico's guitars were based largely on the 1920s version of the Gibson L-5 with a 16 inch lower bout and \\"snakehead\\" headstock design, but by 1937, he had settled on four main f-hole archtop guitar designs, heavily influenced by the Gibson L-5:Bonds, Ray (ed.)

Later models had functional truss rods.Wheeler, Tom (1982). pp. 22-23. By the late 40s, D'Angelico was building only the Excel and the New Yorker. All New Yorker models featured pearl inlays in the headstock and fingerboards, as well as quadruple bindings.Achard, Ken (1999). p. 16. All of D‚ÄôAngelico's guitars were hand-built, and many were customized for specific people, so substantial variation is evident in his output. D‚ÄôAngelico's shop rarely made more than 30 guitars per year.Bonds, Ray (ed.) (2006). p. 106. In all, it is estimated that he built 1,164 guitars.Wheeler, Tom (1982). pp. 22. D‚ÄôAngelico also built a few round-hole (as opposed to f-hole) archtops, and a few mandolins. While D'Angelico's craftsmanship was not always exemplary, the performance of his guitars established him as the premier maker of archtop guitars. During the late 1930s, when production was at its peak, D'Angelico made approximately 35 instruments per year with the help of only two workers, one of whom was Vincent \\"Jimmy\\" DiSerio. His recognition as the \\"finest builder of archtop guitars\\" later brought offers from larger companies, but ultimately he decided to keep his operation under his own name. During the 1950s, some of the instruments leaving D'Angelico's shop had mixed features, such as an Excel- sized guitar with New Yorker features created for Johnny Smith, or D'Angelico necks custom fitted to bodies customers brought in.Achard, Ken (1999). p. 43. Original D'Angelico guitars are identified by a serial number punched inside the bass f-hole‚Äîthe serial numbers ranging from 1001 to 2164. In 1952 Jimmy D'Aquisto joined the company as an apprentice. D'Angelico had a heart attack in 1959 and also parted ways with DiSerio, who left to work at the Favilla guitar company. As a result, he closed the business but soon reopened it after D'Aquisto who was unable to find work, convinced him to do so. After several more heart attacks and having also suffered from pneumonia John D'Angelico died in 1964 at the age of 59. He had built 1,164 numbered guitars with the last ten finished by D'Aquisto. D'Aquisto then bought the business but a poor business decision lost him the right to the D‚ÄôAngelico name. The D'Angelico Guitars brand has continued under other owners.  Employees  Some of D'Angelico's employees went on to become craftsmen in their own right. Among them were Jimmy Di Serio, who worked for D'Angelico from 1932‚Äì1959, and D'Aquisto who would eventually buy the business from the D'Angelico family. D'Angelico and D'Aquisto are generally regarded as the two greatest archtop guitar makers of the 20th century. In 2011, works by D'Angelico and D'Aquisto were included in the 'Guitar Heroes' exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. Vincent \\"Jimmy\\" DiSerio, was commissioned by Ralph Patt to modify a Gibson ES-150 (six-string archtop hollow-body guitar) to have a wider neck, wider pickup, and eight strings circa 1965; seven strings enabled Patt's major-thirds tuning to have the E-E range of standard tuning, while the eighth string enabled the high A.

She was responsible for delivering troops, goods and equipment to locations in the war zone. Construction Beltrami was laid down under a Maritime Commission contract, MC hull 2107, on 18 July 1944, by Kaiser Cargo, at Richmond, California; launched on 26 September 1944; sponsored by Mrs. Marvin A. Thrash; and acquired by the Navy and commissioned on 4 January 1945, Lieutenant Gerald W. Rahill, USNR, in command. Service history =World War II Pacific Theatre operations= After fitting out at San Francisco, California, Beltrami got underway on 21 January for shakedown operations out of San Pedro, California. There, her crew members practiced loading and unloading cargo and familiarized themselves with Beltramis diesel engines. On 8 February, she loaded frozen food and steamed north to Longview, Washington. There, the cargo ship received a load of lumber from the Weyerhauser Co. before sailing west to Hawaii, arriving in Pearl Harbor on 1 March. Over the next two weeks, the crew unloaded lumber at Port Allen, Kauai, and Nawiliwili Bay, Kauai, before returning to Pearl Harbor. Supplying South Pacific bases Assigned to the Service Force, Pacific Fleet, Beltrami sailed for the Solomon Islands on 21 March. Arriving at Guadalcanal on 3 April, the cargo ship discharged her supplies and immediately began loading for a supply run to the Admiralty Islands. Underway from the Solomons on the 8th, she arrived at Manus Island on 12 April. After unloading her cargo‚ÄîManus was a support base for the ongoing operations in the Philippines and the Ryukyus -- Beltrami sailed to Ulithi, Caroline Islands, on the 25th, anchoring there four days later. Supporting troops in the Philippines Tasked with supporting the Okinawa campaign, Beltrami proceeded to the Philippines on 20 May, arriving in San Pedro Bay, Leyte, on 25 May. She then spent the next month discharging and loading fleet freight before sailing for the Mariana Islands on 22 June. Beltrami operated at Apra Harbor, Guam, for the next four weeks before heading to Ulithi on 21 July. She remained in reserve at that atoll through the end of the war on 15 August. End-of-war activity Beltrami sailed to the Philippines late in August and spent nine weeks operating in the Leyte area, providing passenger and cargo service to the forces ashore. On 8 November, tasked with supporting American occupation forces in China, the cargo ship departed San Pedro Bay for Shanghai, arriving there on 16 November. She remained there until leaving for California on 27 January 1946, mooring in San Francisco harbor on 23 February. =Assigned to the East Coast= Ordered to the US East Coast, Beltrami got underway on 15 March, passed through the Panama Canal on the 28th, and arrived in Norfolk, Virginia, on 8 April. Preparations for Operation Nanook While at that base, the ship received orders to prepare for Operation Nanook‚Äîa project to set up a system of weather stations in the Arctic regions of the Western Hemisphere. She first made brief stops at Baltimore, Maryland, and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in mid-April, both to obtain cold weather gear and to receive equipment modifications for extended sub-zero operations. Beltrami then sailed to New York, embarking LCVPs and picket boats in early May, before moving on to Boston, Massachusetts, to load a detachment of US Marines. Beltrami sailed independently on 15 July, heading north toward the Strait of Belle Isle, Newfoundland. On 25 July, after passing through the Labrador Sea and the Davis Strait, Beltrami rendezvoused with the icebreaker in Lancaster Sound, well above the Arctic Circle. Two days later, the ships entered Dundas Harbor, Devon Island, to disembark the marine detachment. Upon entering the harbor, Northwind grounded on an uncharted pinnacle but was refloated about ten hours later without serious damage. Meanwhile, the marine detachment went ashore and set up a temporary camp at the base of an inactive glacier. Beltrami then proceeded to Thule, Greenland, where she joined the seaplane tender , net-laying ship and sister ship in Task Force (TF) 68. Her crew unloaded the cargo and heavy equipment needed to construct a weather station and an emergency airstrip, before the ship returned to Dundas Harbor on 20 August and reembarked the marines after their three-week field expedition. Returning to Thule on the 22d, she sailed for home two days later and arrived in Boston on 3 September. Cargo operations along the East Coast Over the next two years, Beltrami plied the Atlantic coastal waters of North America, delivering general cargo from Bayonne, New Jersey, and Norfolk to naval stations as far south as the Panama Canal Zone and as far north as Argentia, Newfoundland. She also made regular visits to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba; St. George, Bermuda; and Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico. Service with the Sixth Fleet On 11 February 1949, following the permanent establishment of the U.S. 6th Fleet the previous year, Beltrami began the first of three voyages to the Mediterranean Sea. She visited Casablanca, Morocco; Athens, Greece; and Haifa, Israel; before coming back to Norfolk on 15 April. Beltrami returned to the Mediterranean between 8 October and 2 December of that year and again between 15 June and 7 August 1951. In between these cruises, she also made one voyage to British ports, visiting Gibraltar, Plymouth, and Londonderry between 20 July and 8 September 1950. Final operations For the remainder of her service, Beltrami operated out of Earle, New Jersey, and Norfolk, primarily servicing ports and installations in the West Indies. Her most common duty was the shuttling of passengers and cargo between Guant√°namo Bay, Roosevelt Roads, and Trinidad. Made obsolete by larger and faster cargo ships, Beltrami sailed from Norfolk to Charleston, South Carolina, in late July 1955, arriving at the navy yard there on the 29th. =Final decommissioning= Placed in commission, in reserve, on 1 August 1955, she was towed to Savannah, Georgia, on 28 August, and was decommissioned on 10 November 1955. Her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 April 1960, and she was transferred to the Maritime Administration on 21 June 1960. She was sold for scrap to Hugo Neu Steel Products on 29 August 1960. Military awards and honors The record does not indicate battle stars for Beltrami.

A granitic ridge stretching from the Annapolis Basin to Mount Uniacke, it forms the southern edge of the Annapolis Valley and shelters the valley from the climate effects of the pelagic coast along the Atlantic Ocean. Together with North Mountain, the two ranges form the Annapolis Highlands region. In contrast to its northern counterpart, North Mountain, South Mountain rises gradually over dozens of kilometres from the Atlantic coast and descends sharply at its northern edge where it meets the Meguma strata to form the south wall of the valley. The South Mountain range is also known as the South Mountain Batholith, the largest body of granitoid rocks in the entire Appalachians and comprises both granite barrens and granite uplands. It is estimated to have developed during the late Devonian Age. The highest point on the ridge is at an unnamed point in Kings County, 26 kilometres southeast of Berwick near Lake George.

Life Hagy grew up in Sparrows Point, Maryland and drove an ambulance, an ice cream truck, and eventually a cab until he retired in 2004. Hagy's chants and persona developed him into an icon associated with the Baltimore Orioles for years. While leading cheers from \\"The Roar from 34\\" at Memorial Stadium, Wild Bill became a Baltimore institution. Standing at six feet two inches tall, Hagy was an easily recognized figure at the ball park, always adorned in sun glasses and a straw cowboy-styled hat. Hagy found the inspiration in his cheers from Leonard \\"Big Wheel\\" Burrier, a famous fan who led the Baltimore Colts in similar cheers. Hagy is said to symbolize the term \\"Orioles Magic\\" as his cheers sometimes led to comeback victories for the Orioles. Eventually the team recognized his enthusiasm and let him do his Orioles cheers from atop the dugout. Hagy's fame led him to meet Presidents such as Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan, and to get writeups in The New York Times. In 1985, Hagy boycotted Memorial Stadium for not being allowed to bring in his own beer. At the end of a game he tossed his cooler of beer onto the field, never to return. Hagy did return to Camden Yards however, the night Cal Ripken broke the longtime record for consecutive games played. Hagy led the fans in his famous cheer on one of baseball's greatest nights. Hagy's last known O-R-I-O-L-E-S cheer was performed at Ripken's Hall of Fame induction ceremony in Cooperstown, New York on July 29, 2007. Hagy died at his home in Arbutus, Maryland less than a month after the ceremony. Hagy is in the Orioles Hall of Fame. Bill also was married at least once and donated bone marrow to a needy relative.

It is covalently linked to these phycobiliproteins by a thioether bond. Phycocyanobilin, PCB, has the ability to bind to human serum albumin, HSA, protein found mainly in the blood of humans. This PCB-HCA complex benefits the structure of HSA, increasing the thermal stability of HSA, as well as increasing its ability to prevent against proteolytic activity of other proteins.

Alexander was born at Jedburgh on 21 January 1264. He was the second child and elder son of King Alexander III of Scotland and Margaret of England, preceded by a daughter named Margaret and followed by a son called David. The Scottish crown was determined that the young Alexander should be adequately established. In 1270, he was made Earl of Fife for the duration of the minority of the heir to the earldom, Duncan III, who was then eight years old. Probably sometime after 1275, Alexander was also made Lord of Mann, which gave him revenue and a \\"quasi-royal position of dignity\\" while also assuring the people of the island that the recently established Scottish rule would be efficient. Alexander's mother, Queen Margaret, died in 1275. It is evident from the letters of Alexander and his sister that the family remained close to their maternal uncle King Edward I of England. Alexander's brother, David, died in 1281, the year when their sister married King Eric II of Norway. King Alexander did not seek a second wife for about ten years, focusing instead on arranging a suitable marriage for his surviving son, the young Alexander. In 1281, the King started negotiating with Guy, Count of Flanders, about his son's marriage to the Count's daughter, also named Margaret. The marriage was celebrated on 15 November 1282. Alexander's sister died in Norway in childbirth in 1283, leaving Alexander as the sole surviving child of the King of Scotland. A week after his twentieth birthday, on 28 January 1284, the young Alexander also died. He was buried at Dunfermline Abbey. By April it was clear that his widow was not pregnant and that his sister's daughter, Margaret, Maid of Norway, was the new heir presumptive. King Alexander hastened to contract a second marriage, choosing Yolanda of Dreux, but died in 1286.

The parish includes the communities of Ebley, Cashes Green and Hamwell Leaze, and part of Dudbridge. The population of the civil parish was 6,680 (in 2001) of which 14.6% are in the 5-14 age group. The area is predominantly white (98.4%) with a high proportion of lone parent households with dependent children in comparison to the Stroud and county averages. 18.8% of the household rent from a social landlord, 6.2% of household are claiming housing benefit, and 22.4% of households have no car - again all much higher than the county or Stroud profiles. Lone pensioner households are also high, at 18.2%, with smaller proportions of people providing unpaid care, and higher social service referrals for the over-75s than elsewhere. As a relatively prosperous parish within Gloucestershire, there are low levels of burglary, theft of motor vehicles; the numbers of serious and fatal road traffic accidents compared to the county average. The percentage of young offenders resident in the area and of children with low scores at key stages 1-3, are also below the Stroud and county averages. The parish council is hoping to improve provision of community and youth facilities; these, along with levels of open space, were identified in the 2006 Parish Plan as key issues along with library, post office and evening bus services. The site of a former hospital is being redeveloped with community consultation involving a Bristol-based company with a strong regeneration record. A new Children‚Äôs Centre is being developed on the nearby Cashes Green Primary school site. Cainscross is well served with local amenities, including a post office and a medium-sized co-operative supermarket. It is well connected to Stroud (only a 25-minute walk away) with frequent bus services to Stonehouse, Gloucester and Cheltenham. The Stroudwater Canal is easily accessible to the south, as is Selsley Common. Stroud town centre lies 1.6 miles (2.5 km) to the east. Governance An electoral ward in the same name exists. Much of this ward is in the parish of Cainscross but the ward stretches to Randwick. The total ward population taken at the 2011 census was 7,316.

They are shrubs and small trees. The leaves are deciduous and the stems are usually thorny. Distribution Canthium species are predominantly found in Southeast Asia, especially in Thailand and the Philippines. A small number of species is found in India, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh. Only a limited number of species is found on the African continent, especially in Southern and East Africa. Taxonomy Canthium was named by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck in 1785 in Encyclop√©die M√©thodique. The name is a latinisation of \\"kantankara\\", a Malayalam name from Kerala for Canthium coromandelicum. Kantan means \\"shining\\" and kara means \\"a spiny shrub\\". The biological type for the genus consists of specimens originally described by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck as Canthium parviflorumCanthium In: Index Nominum Genericorum. In: Regnum Vegetabile but this species is now included in Canthium coromandelicum. Canthium is a member of Vanguerieae, a tribe that is monophyletic and easily recognized morphologically, but in which generic boundaries were, for a long time, very unclear. Canthium was especially problematic, and until the 1980s, it was defined broadly and known to be polyphyletic. Psydrax was separated from it in 1985, as was Keetia in 1986. These were followed by Pyrostria and Multidentia in 1987. The subgenus Afrocanthium was raised to generic rank in 2004, followed by Bullockia in 2009. A few species were transferred to Canthium from Rytigynia and other genera in 2004. The genus was further reduced by the transfer of species to Peponidium and Pyrostria. In 2016, two Canthium species endemic to the Philippines were transferred to a genus of their own, Kanapia. The final circumscription of Canthium will remain in doubt until phylogenetic studies achieve greater resolution for the clade containing Canthium coromandelicum and its closest relatives.

James Gray was a trader in leather, wine, wool and grain. He is said to have also been a \\"boxkeeper\\" and then footman to King James II. From a packet of letters in his own hand (now in the National Archives of Scotland) he managed the affairs in London of the Duke of Montrose, amongst others.

The Nishant UAV is primarily tasked with intelligence gathering over enemy territory and also for reconnaissance, training, surveillance, target designation, artillery fire correction, damage assessment, ELINT and SIGINT. The UAV has an endurance of four hours and thirty minutes. Nishant has completed development phase and user trials. The 380 kg (840 lb) Nishant UAV requires rail-launching from a hydro-pneumatic launcher and is able to be recovered by a parachute system. Launches at a velocity of 45 m/s are carried out in 0.6 second with 100 kW power and subsequent launches can be carried out in intervals of 20 minutes. The Mobile Hydro-Pneumatic Launcher (MHPL) system mounted on a Tatra truck weighs 14,000 kg (31,000 lb) and boasts of a life cycle of 1000 launches before requiring overhaul. Nishant is one of the few UAVs in the world in its weight-class capable of being catapult-launched and recovered by using parachute, thus eliminating the need for a runway as in case of conventional take-off and landing with wheels. Development To meet the Army's operational requirement of a RPV (remotely piloted vehicle), it was decided in September 1988 that DRDO would undertake the indigenous development of the UAV. The General Staff Qualitative Requirement (GSQR) was finalised by the Army in May 1990. The Nishant RPV made its first test flight in 1995. In July 1999, for the first time the Indian army deployed its new Nishant UAV system in the fight against guerilla forces backed by Pakistan in Kashmir. Nishant, which had been developed for battlefield surveillance and reconnaissance needs of the Indian Army, was test flown again in early 2002. The indigenous Unmanned Air Vehicle (UAV) Nishant developed by ADE, DRDO had completed its 100th flight by June 15, 2002. The Indian Army has placed an order for 12 Nishant UAVs along with ground support systems. Nishant Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) developed by DRDO for Indian Army was successfully flight tested near Kolar on 20 June 2008. Nishant has completed development phase and user trials. The present flight tests are pre confirmatory trials before induction into services.Successful Flight Tests of Nishant UAV =Test flight with Wankel engine= On Sunday, 5 April 2009 DRDO launched a test flight of the Nishant UAV. The main goal was to test the performance of the Wankel engine used on the UAV. An abandoned World War II runway at a village near Kolar played host to the first ever flight of this indigenous rotary engine- powered UAV. The flight took off on early Sunday morning and climbed to an altitude of before cruising for a duration of 35 minutes. The air vehicle was recovered safely at the intended place at a dried-up lake, after a total flight duration of 40 min. The engine, a Wankel rotary type, was jointly designed and developed by National Aerospace Laboratories (NAL), Vehicle Research and Development Establishment (VRDE) and Aeronautical Development Establishment (ADE). The provisional flight clearance for the first indigenous prototype engine was given by the certifying agency, the Regional Centre for Military Airworthiness and Certification. The engine was cleared for flight after rigorous ground endurance test runs. The Wankel engine weighs about 30 kg (70 lb), and this engine type is known for its high power-to-weight ratio in a single rotor category. DRDO was satisfied with the test results. The performance of the engine during the flight met the requirements of the first flight of an engine in the air vehicle. This 55 hp indigenous engine is expected to replace the present imported engine of Nishant. The critical core engine, including the special cylinder composite nickel‚Äìsilicon carbide coating and special aluminium alloy castings, was designed and developed by NAL. VRDE developed engine peripherals such as the ignition and fuel systems and ADE developed flight testing. The reconnaissance UAV, which has completed its user trials with the Indian Army, is expected to be handed over to the army shortly. Nishant UAV again underwent crucial confirmatory user trials at Pokhran in April 2010. The trials began April 20 and were supposed to last for one week. A senior Army official at Pokhran said the trials are moving forward in a very satisfactory manner. ‚ÄúWe are checking three crucial parameters: video quality, tracking ability and fall of gunshot [missed distance after firing]. These input performances are critical to our operations in the forward areas,‚Äù the official said. DRDO has delivered the first four UAVs to the Indian Army at a cost of 800 million ($17.9 million). According to The Times Of India, two UAVs crash-landed in Jaisalmer district near the India- Pakistan border due to change in wind direction on April 28 and April 30. Confirming the news, a DRDO official said, \\"The user trials were going on and during the flight there were some technical snags owing to which the craft was landed using parachutes.\\" He said, \\"But the landing was done safely and no one was hurt in the process. Though before our officials could reach to get the craft back, villagers damaged the aircraft and took away some equipment.\\" On 3 February 2011 Nishant UAV successfully completed confirmatory trials conducted by the Indian Army at Pokhran, Rajasthan A wheeled version of the Nishant UAV, named panchi, is under taxi trail as of September 2014, will be flight tested soon.

The Munro Baronetcy, of Foulis in the County of Ross, was created in the Baronetage of Nova Scotia on 7 June 1634 for Colonel Hector Monro, with remainder to his heirs male whatsoever. On the death of his son, the second Baronet, in 1651, the male line of the first Baronet failed and the title was inherited by Robert Munro, grandson of George Munro, uncle of the first Baronet. The sixth Baronet represented Tain Burghs in the House of Commons and also fought at the Battle of Fontenoy in 1745. He was killed at the Battle of Falkirk in 1746. The seventh Baronet sat as Member of Parliament for Ross-shire and Tain Burghs. The ninth Baronet fought in the Peninsular War and later commanded a division of the Colombian Army under Sim√≥n Bol√≠var. The eleventh Baronet served as Lord-Lieutenant of Ross and Cromarty from 1899 to 1935. The presumed sixteenth Baronet never successfully proved his succession and was never on the Official Roll of the Baronetage. The presumed 17th and present Baronet has also not successfully proven his succession and is not on the Official Roll of the Baronetage, with the baronetcy considered dormant since 1996. The Baronets were also Chiefs of Clan Munro until the death of the eleventh Baronet in 1935 when the chieftancy passed to his daughter and was separated from the baronetcy. From 1954, the baronets were styled \\"of Foulis-Obsdale\\" to distinguish their Arms and Designation from those of Munro of Foulis.For more information, follow this link. The Munro Baronetcy, of Lindertis in the County of Forfar, was created in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom on 6 August 1825 for the soldier and colonial administrator Thomas Munro. He was a Major- General in the Army and served as Governor of Madras between 1820 and 1827.

The character of pompous police Chief Inspector Charles Rose (William Mervyn) at the start of series 3 cemented the show's popularity and The Odd Man turned out to be the first in a trilogy lasting most of the 1960s, during which Rose's character slowly developed and became increasingly genial as they progressed. The Odd Man This series originally dealt with the investigations of theatrical-agent-cum-detective Steve Gardiner (played by Geoffrey Toone in the first season, replaced by Edwin Richfield thereafter). Gardiner was the \\"odd man\\" of the series' title, and his encounters with the police in the form of Chief Inspector Gordon (Moultrie Kelsall) for series 1 and 2. Kelsall was replaced by Chief Inspector Charles Rose (William Mervyn) from series three onwards. Rose was assisted by Detective Sergeant Macbride (Alan Tilvern) who lasted just the one season. He was replaced by Detective Sergeant Swift (played by Keith Barron) for the final series in 1963. It's Dark Outside The characters of Rose and Swift were then given their own series, It's Dark Outside, which ran for two series in 1964 and 1965. The stories were edgy, with Barron's character frequently feeling repressed and confused by the turn of events, which often had him one step behind his superior's superior approach and attitude. Barron left at the end of series 1, to be replaced by Anthony Ainley in the role of Detective Sergeant Hunter. Mr Rose The third and final series in the trilogy was Mr Rose, and saw the title character enjoying retirement in Eastbourne. Rose attempted to write his memoirs but found himself being drawn into private detection instead. The theme tune for Mr Rose was by John Snow, and issued on a single as a cover version by Roy Budd on the Pye Records label in 1967. A separate cover version was recorded on the album Time For TV by Brian Fahey and his Orchestra, on the Studio 2 Stereo label. John Snow's original recording was recorded by the De Wolfe mood music library, and is not commercially available.

A bullaun (; from a word cognate with \\"bowl\\" and French bol) is the term used for the depression in a stone which is often water filled. Natural rounded boulders or pebbles may sit in the bullaun. The size of the bullaun is highly variable and these hemispherical cups hollowed out of a rock may come as singles or multiples with the same rock.Pennick, Nigel (1996). Celtic Sacred Landscapes. London: Thames & Hudson. . P. 40. Local folklore often attaches religious or magical significance to bullaun stones, such as the belief that the rainwater collecting in a stone's hollow has healing properties.Anthony Weir, Early Ireland, A Field Guide, Blackstaff Press, 1980, Ritual use of some bullaun stones continued well into the Christian period and many are found in association with early churches, such as the 'Deer' Stone at Glendalough, County Wicklow. The example at St Brigit's Stone, County Cavan, still has its 'cure' or 'curse' stones. These would be used by turning them whilst praying for or cursing somebody. In May 2012 the second cursing stone to be found in Scotland was discovered on Canna and drawn soon after by archaeological illustrator Thomas Small. Small Finds & Design.

Bullauns are not unique to Ireland and Scotland, being also found on the Swedish island of Gotland, and in Lithuania and France. 'King Arthur's footprint' at Tintagel Castle, Cornwall, among other circular depressions at prehistoric ritual sites in Devon & Cornwall, was previously associated with kingship rituals. Possibly enlarged from already-existing solution-pits caused by rain, bullauns are reminiscent of the cup-marked stones which occur all over Atlantic Europe, and their significance (if not their precise use) must date from Neolithic times. Rosewall Hill near St Ives in Cornwall UK has several bullaun which can be found on top, or near the tops of the granite outcrops or cairns on high points on the hill. It is open to question as to whether or not these are man- made or formed by the natural erosion of the granite. Many of the granite boulders on this hill have what appear to be erosion formed concavities, usually pear shaped, which indicate bullaun in formation. However, the location of the larger forms on the tops of the outcrops does suggest that these sites have been chosen. Trevalgan Hill, just to the north of Rosewall Hill, has a round bullaun some 50 cm across as can be seen in the photograph.

Although mostly associated with the Latin American Boom of the 1960s and 1970s, the dictator-novel genre has its roots in the nineteenth-century non-fiction work Facundo (1845), by Domingo Faustino Sarmiento. As an indirect critique of Juan Manuel de Rosas's dictatorial r√©gime in Argentina, Facundo is the forerunner of the dictator novel genre; all subsequent dictator novels hearken back to it. As established by Sarmiento, the goal of the genre is not to analyze the rule of particular dictators, or to focus on historical accuracy, but to examine the abstract nature of authority figures and of authority in general. To be considered a dictator novel, a story should have strong political themes drawn from history, a critical examination of the power held by the dictator, the caudillo, and some general reflection on the nature of authoritarianism. Although some dictator novels centre on one historical dictator (albeit in fictional guise), they do not analyze the economics, politics, and rule of the r√©gime as might a history book. The dictator novel genre includes I, the Supreme (1974), by Augusto Roa Bastos, about Dr. Francia of Paraguay, and The Feast of the Goat (2000), by Mario Vargas Llosa, about Rafael Le√≥nidas Trujillo of the Dominican Republic. Alternatively, the novelist might create a fictional dictator to achieve the same narrative end, as in Reasons of State (1974), by Alejo Carpentier, in which the dictator is a composite man assembled from historical dictators. The genre of the dictator novel has been very influential in the development of a Latin American literary tradition, because many of the novelists rejected traditional, linear story-telling techniques, and developed narrative styles that blurred the distinctions between reader, narrator, plot, characters, and story. In examining the authority of leadership, the novelists also assessed their own social roles as paternalistic dispensers of wisdom, like that of the caudillo whose r√©gime they challenged in their dictator novels. Literary context Literary critic Roberto Gonz√°lez Echevarr√≠a argues that the dictator novel is \\"the most clearly indigenous thematic tradition in Latin American literature\\", and traces the development of this theme from \\"as far back as Bernal D√≠az del Castillo's and Francisco L√≥pez de G√≥mara's accounts of Cort√©s's conquest of Mexico.\\" The nineteenth century saw significant literary reflections on political power, though on the whole the dictator novel is associated with the Latin American Boom, a literary movement of the 1960s and 1970s. For critic Gerald Martin, the dictator novel marks the end of the Boom and even (as he says of Roa Bastos's I, the Supreme) \\"the end of an entire era in Latin American history, the era which had stretched from Sarmiento's Facundo in 1845.\\" In the 1970s, many dictator novels focused on the figure \\"of the aging dictator, prey to the boredom of a limitless power he is on the verge of losing.\\"  Definition  Miguel √Ångel Asturias's El Se√±or Presidente (written in 1933, but not published until 1946) is, in the opinion of critic Gerald Martin, \\"the first real dictator novel\\". Other literary treatments of the dictator figure followed, such as Jorge Zalamea's El Gran Burund√∫n Burund√° ha muerto, but the genre did not gain impetus until it was reinvented in the political climate of the cold war, through the Latin American Boom. The dictator novel came back into fashion in the 1970s, towards the end of the Boom. As Sharon Keefe Ugalde remarks, \\"the 1970s mark a new stage in the evolution of the Latin American dictator novel, characterized by at least two developments: a change in the perspective from which the dictator is viewed and a new focus on the nature of language.\\"Keefe Ugalde, p. 369 By this she means that the dictator novels of the 1970s, such as The Autumn of the Patriarch or I, the Supreme, offer the reader a more intimate view of their subject: \\"the dictator becomes protagonist\\" and the world is often seen from his point of view. With the new focus on language, Keefe Ugalde points to the realisation on the part of many authors that \\"the tyrant's power is derived from and defeated by language.\\" For example, in Jorge Zalamea's El Gran Burund√∫n Burund√° ha muerto the dictator bans all forms of language. According to Raymond L. Williams, it was not until the 1970s, when enough Latin American writers had published novels dealing with military regimes, that \\"dictator novel\\" became common nomenclature. The most celebrated novels of this era were Alejo Carpentier's Reasons of State (1974), Augusto Roa Bastos's I, the Supreme (1974), and Gabriel Garc√≠a Marquez's The Autumn of the Patriarch (1975). He defines the dictator novel as a novel which draws upon the historical record to create fictionalized versions of dictators. In this way, the author is able to use the specific to explain the general, as many dictator novels are centred around the rule of a one particular dictator. Within this group he includes those novelists who took to task authoritarian figures such as Vargas Llosa's Conversation in the Cathedral (1969) and Denzil Romero's La tragedia del General√≠simo (1984). He even includes Sergio Ram√≠rez's ¬øTe dio miedo la sangre? (1977), a novel about Nicaraguan society under the Somoza dictatorship, which has been described as a \\"dictator novel without the dictator\\".  Style and theme  The novelists of the dictator novel genre combined narrative strategies of both modern and postmodern writing. Postmodern techniques, constructed largely in the late 1960s and 1970s, included use of interior monologues, radically stream-of-consciousness narrative, fragmentation, varying narrative points of view, neologisms, innovative narrative strategies, and frequent lack of causality. Alejo Carpentier, a Boom writer and contributor to the dictator novel genre pioneered what came to be known as magical realism, although the use of this technique is not necessarily a prerequisite of the dictator novel, as there are many that do not utilize magical realism. A predominant theme of the dictator novel is power, which according literary critic Michael Valdez Moses, in his 2002 review of Feast of the Goat, is linked to the theme of dictatorship: \\"The enduring power of the Latin American dictator novel had everything to do with the enduring power of Latin American dictators\\". As novels such as El Se√±or Presidente became more well-known, they were read as ambitious political statements, denouncing the authority of dictators in Latin America. As political statements, dictator novel authors challenged dictatorial power, creating a link between power and writing through the force wielded by their pen. For example, in Roa Bastos's I, The Supreme, the novel revolves around a central theme of language and the power inherent in all of its forms, a power that is often only present in the deconstruction of communication. Gonz√°lez Echevarr√≠a argues that: > Dr. Francia's fear of the pasquinade, his abuse of Policarpo Pati√±o ..., > [and] his constant worry about writing all stem from the fact that he has > found and used the power implicit in language itself. The Supremo defines > power as being able to do through others what we are unable to do ourselves: > language, being separate from what it designates, is the very embodiment of > power, for things act and mean through it without ceasing to be themselves. > Dr. Francia has also realized that he cannot control language, particularly > written language, that it has a life of its own that threatens him. Another constant theme which runs throughout the Latin American dictator novel, which gained in importance and frequency during the Latin American Boom, is the interdependence of the Latin American tyrant and United States imperialism. In Mario Vargas Llosa's The Feast of the Goat, for example, Trujillo faces serious opposition shortly after losing his material backing from the CIA, previously held for over 32 years in light of his anti-communist leanings. Gender is an additional overarching theme within dictator novels. National portraits in Latin America often insist on the importance of women (and men) that are healthy, happy, productive, and patriotic, yet many national literary treasures often reflect government rhetoric in the way they code active citizenship as male. Masculinity is an enduring motif in the dictator novel. There is a connection between the pen and the penis in Latin American fiction, but this pattern cannot be explained by machismo alone‚Äîit is far more complex. According to Rebecca E. Biron, \\"where we find violent, misogynistic fantasies of masculinity, we also [find] violent social relations between actual men and women.\\" Many Latin American works \\"include characters who act out violent fictions of masculinity, and yet their narrative structure provides readers with alternative responses to misogynistic fantasies of masculine identity formation\\". Historical context =Dictators in Latin American history= Since independence, Latin American countries have been subject to both right and left-wing authoritarian regimes, stemming from a history of colonialism in which one group dominated another. Given this long history, it is unsurprising that there have been so many novels \\"about individual dictators, or about the problems of dictatorship caudillismo, caciquismo, militarism and the like.\\" The legacy of colonialism is one of racial conflict sometimes pushing an absolute authority to rise up to contain it‚Äîthus the tyrant is born. Seeking unlimited power, dictators often amend constitutions, dismantling laws which prevent their reelection. Licenciado Manuel Estrada Cabrera, for example, altered the Guatemalan Constitution in 1899 to permit his return to power. The dictators who have become the focus of the dictator novel (Augusto Roa Bastos's I, the Supreme, for instance, is based on Paraguay's dictator of the early nineteenth century, the so-called Dr Francia) do not differ much from each other in terms of how they govern. As author Gonz√°lez Echevarr√≠a states: \\"they are male, militaristic, and wield almost absolute personal power.\\" Their strong-arm tactics include exiling or imprisoning their opposition, attacking the freedom of the press, creating a centralized government backed by a powerful military force, and assuming complete control over free thought. Despite intense criticisms leveled at these figures, dictators involved in nationalist movements developed three simple truths, \\"that everybody belonged, that the benefits of Progress should be shared, and that industrial development should be the priority\\". Epit√°cio Pessoa, who was elected President of Brazil in 1919, wanted to make the country progress regardless of whether or not Congress passed the laws he proposed. In particular, during the Great Depression, Latin American activist governments of the 1930s saw the end of neocolonialism and the infusion of nationalist movements throughout Latin America, increasing the success of import substitution industrialization or ISI. The positive side-effect of the collapse of international trade meant local Latin American manufacturers could fill the market niches left vacant by vanishing exports. In the twentieth century, prominent Latin American dictators have included the Somoza dynasty in Nicaragua, Alfredo Stroessner in Paraguay, and Augusto Pinochet in Chile, among others. As an outside influence, United States interference in Latin American politics is controversial and has often been severely criticized. As Garc√≠a Calderon noted as far back as 1925: \\"Does it want peace or is it controlled by certain interests?\\" As a theme in the dictator novel, the link between U.S. imperialism and the power of the tyrant is very important. Dictators in Latin America have accepted military and financial support from the United States when it suited them, but have also turned against the United States, using anti-American campaigning to gain favour with the people. In the case of Trujillo, \\"Nothing promises to reinvigorate his flagging popularity more than to face up to the Yankee aggressor in the name of la patria.\\" In the first decade of the 21st century, the pendulum swung in the other direction, introducing a series of 'left wing' governments to the region that curtailed civil liberties and set up their own messy version of popular dictatorships through a process that has been called \\"competitive authoritarianism\\". The most well-known of these was President Hugo Ch√°vez of Venezuela, and came to include other countries in his Bolivarian Alliance of the Americas (Cuba, Nicaragua, Bolivia, Ecuador, Honduras - and in some ways Argentina, though it was not an official member) in what was called the Pink tide. = Los Padres de la Patria = In 1967 during a meeting with Alejo Carpentier, Julio Cort√°zar, and Miguel Otero Silva, the Mexican author Carlos Fuentes launched a project consisting of a series of biographies depicting Latin American dictators, which was to be called Los Padres de la Patria (The Fathers of the Fatherland). After reading Edmund Wilson's portraits of the American Civil War in Patriotic Gore, Fuentes recounts, \\"Sitting in a pub in Hampstead, we thought it would be a good idea to have a comparable book on Latin America. An imaginary portrait gallery immediately stepped forward, demanding incarnation: the Latin American dictators.\\" Vargas Llosa was to write about Manuel A. Odr√≠a, Jorge Edwards about Jos√© Manuel Balmaceda, Jos√© Donoso about Mariano Melgarejo, and Julio Cort√°zar about Eva Per√≥n. As M. Mar Langa Pizarro observes, the project was never completed, but it helped inspire a series of novels written by important authors during the Latin American literary boom, such as Alejo Carpentier, Augusto Roa Bastos, Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez, and Mario Vargas Llosa. Development of the genre = Forerunners = Juan Manuel de Rosas, Argentine caudillo, by Cayetano Descalzi (1809-1886) Both Domingo Faustino Sarmiento's Facundo and Jos√© Marmol's Amalia, published in the nineteenth century, were precursors to the twentieth century dictator novel; however, \\"all fictional depictions of the Latin American 'strong-man', have an important antecedent in Domingo Faustino Sarmiento's Facundo, a work written as a sociolodical treatise\\". Facundo is an indirect critique of Juan Manuel de Rosas's dictatorship, directed against the actual historical figure, Juan Facundo Quiroga, but is also a broader investigation into Argentine history and culture. Sarmiento's Facundo has remained a fundamental fixture because of the breadth of its literary exploration of the Latin American environment. In Facundo, Sarmiento criticizes the historical figure Facundo Quiroga, a provincial caudillo, who like Rosas (dictator of Argentina from 1829 to 1853) was opposed to the enlightened ideas of progress. After returning from exile, Sarmiento worked to reinvent Argentina, eventually becoming president himself from 1868 to 1874. Sarmiento's analysis of Facundo Quiroga was the first time that an author questioned how figures like Facundo and Rosas could have maintained such absolute power, and in answering this question, Facundo established its place as an inspirational text to later authors. Sarmiento perceived his own power in writing Facundo as \\"within the text of the novel, it is the novelist, through the voice of omniscience, who has replaced God\\", thereby creating the bridge between writing and power that is characteristic of the dictator novel. Set in post-colonial Buenos Aires, Amalia was written in two parts and is a semi-autobiographical account of Jos√© M√°rmol that deals with living in Rosas's police state. M√°rmol's novel was important as it showed how the human consciousness, much like a city or even a country, could become a terrifying prison. Amalia also attempted to examine the problem of dictatorships as being one of structure, and therefore the problem of the state \\"manifested through the will of some monstrous personage violating the ordinary individual's privacy, both of home and of consciousness.\\" In the early twentieth century, the Spaniard Ram√≥n del Valle- Incl√°n's Tirano Banderas (1926) acted as a key influence on those authors whose goal was to critique power structures and the status quo. =Classic dictator novels= *El Se√±or Presidente is a 1946 novel by Guatemalan Nobel Prize-winning writer and diplomat Miguel √Ångel Asturias. Although the novel does not explicitly identify its setting as early twentieth-century Guatemala, Asturias was inspired by the 1898‚Äì1920 presidency of Manuel Estrada Cabrera for his title character. This novel explores the nature of political dictatorship and its effects on society, and is an overtly political novel in which Asturias denounces Latin American dictators. By keeping time and place ambiguous, Asturias's novel represents a break from former narratives, which until this point had been judged on how adequately they reflected reality. Asturias's distinctive use of dream imagery, onomatopoeia, simile, and repetition, combined with a discontinuous structure consisting of abrupt changes of style and viewpoint, sprang from surrealist and ultraist influences. Furthermore, it made early use of a literary technique that would come to be known as magic realism. The President went on to influence a generation of Latin American authors, becoming an early example of the \\"new novel\\" and a precursor to the Latin American literary boom. *Jorge Zalamea, El gran Burund√∫n Burund√° ha Muerto (\\"The Great Burund√∫n Burund√° is Dead\\", 1951). For Keefe Ugalde, \\"El gran Burund√∫n Burund√° ... occupies an important midway point in the evolution of the dictator novel\\" and Peter Neissa emphasizes \\"its cultural and political importance and subsequent influence on dictator narratives.\\" More broadly, Martin describes this \\"remarkable Colombian novelette\\" as seeming to contain \\"the seeds of Garc√≠a M√°rquez's mature style.\\" The book describes the (fictional) dictator \\"Burund√∫n's rise to power, selected events during his regime, and a description of his funeral.\\" It is at this funeral that it is revealed that the body of the dictator is absent, and has somehow been replaced by or transformed into \\"a great big parrot, a voluminous parrot, an enormous parrot, all swollen, inflated and wrapped in documents, gazettes, mail from abroad, newspapers, reports, annals, broadsheets, almanacs, official bulletins.\\" *Enrique Lafourcade's King Ahab's Feast (La Fiesta del rey Acab, 1959) portrays the fictional dictator C√©sar Alejandro Carrillo Acab, and opens with what Claude Hulet describes as an \\"amusingly ironic, tongue-in-cheek note in preface\\" which declares that \\"This is a mere work of fiction. ... Indeed, no one is unaware that neither the United Nations, nor the Organization of American States, permits the continued existence of regimes like the one that serves as pretext to this novel.\\" As Hulet observes, Lafourcade's \\"powerful and razor sharp satire\\" is directed \\"presumably against the Trujillo regime and others like it.\\"Hulet, p. 67 *Alejo Carpentier's, Reasons of State (El recurso del m√©todo, 1974), is a synthesis of several historical figures from Latin American, most prominently Gerardo Machado, dictator of Cuba. This fictional character, in his bid to be refined, spends half of his life in Europe, perhaps reminiscent of Sarmiento's dichotomy of civilization and barbarism. This novel is tragicomic in nature, the only novel by Carpentier to combine elements of both tragedy and comedy. *Augusto Roa Bastos' I, the Supreme (Yo, el Supremo, 1974) is a fictionalized account of the nineteenth-century Paraguayan dictator Jos√© Gaspar Rodr√≠guez de Francia. However, it's also a historical account, making use of real documents and accounts of people who knew Francia. Roa's portrayal of a despot in Latin American fiction is distinguished \\"not only by the quantity of detail lavished on him, but by his remarkable capacity to seem at one moment a person, at another an embodiment of contradictory elements not usually associated with a single person, let alone a powerful tyrant\\". Its title was derived from the fact that Francia referred to himself as \\"El Supremo\\" or \\"the Supreme\\". Making use of non-traditional writing techniques, the novel is composed of separate discourses with their own distinctive styles, and the demarcation between them is often blurred. Gerald Martin claims that Roa Bastos's novel \\"was more immediately and unanimously acclaimed than any novel since One Hundred Years of Solitude, and critics seemed to suspect that its strictly historical importance might be even greater than that of Garc√≠a M√°rquez's fabulously successful creation.\\" *Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez's The Autumn of the Patriarch (El oto√±o del patriarca, 1975) details the life of an eternal dictator, \\"El Macho\\", a fictional character who lives to be over 200 years old. The book is divided into six sections, each retelling the same story of the infinite power held by the archetypal Caribbean tyrant. M√°rquez based his fictional dictator on a variety of real-life autocrats, including Gustavo Rojas Pinilla of his Colombian homeland, Generalissimo Francisco Franco of Spain (the novel was written in Barcelona), and Venezuela's Juan Vicente G√≥mez. One of the key characters of the novel is the Indian General Saturno Santos, who devotes himself to \\"inscrutable service to the patriarch.\\" In this novel, Garc√≠a M√°rquez proposes an interesting contradiction: \\"that Latin America's patriarchs owe their most intimate support to their victims of longest standing; and that America's revolution is inconceivable without the Indian\\". Illustrating the importance of the Indian in Latin America is all the more prudent given that Garc√≠a M√°rquez's home country, Colombia, is distinguished as literarily not recognizing the Indian populations which are very much alive today. *Luisa Valenzuela's The Lizard's Tail (Cola de lagartija, 1983) is set in the period after Juan Per√≥n's return to Argentina in 1973, when the Argentine president was heavily influenced by the sinister √©minence grise Jos√© L√≥pez Rega. The novel deals specifically with themes surrounding the nature of male-female relationships during this regime of military oppression. The novel's title is a reference to an instrument of torture that was invented in the Southern Cone. *Tom√°s Eloy Mart√≠nez's The Per√≥n Novel (La novela de Per√≥n, 1985) uses a mixture of historical facts, fiction, and documents to retell the life story of Juan Domingo Per√≥n, \\"dramatizing the rivalries within the ranks of Peronism\\". This allowed the author to construct an intimate portrait of Per√≥n rather than an historically accurate one. This method of analyzing Per√≥n, that delves into his early history and family upbringing to theorize the motivation for his actions later in life, can be linked to Sarmiento's similar analyses of Facundo, and through him, Rosas. *Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez's The General in His Labyrinth (El general en su laberinto, 1989) is a fictionalized account of the last days in the life of Sim√≥n Bol√≠var. Bol√≠var, also known as the Great Liberator, freed from Spanish rule the territory that would subsequently become Venezuela, Bolivia, Colombia, Peru, and Ecuador. However the character of the General is not portrayed as the glorious hero that traditional history has presented; instead Garc√≠a M√°rquez develops a pathetic protagonist, a prematurely aged man who is physically ill and mentally exhausted. *Mario Vargas Llosa's The Feast of the Goat (La fiesta del chivo, 2000) recounts with \\"gruesome detail and dramatic intensity\\" the last days of the tyrant and dictator Rafael Le√≥nidas Trujillo. Llosa describes Trujillo's weakening dominance over the Dominican Republic, as he becomes infuriated that, despite being a long-standing ally of the United States because of his anti-communist stance, he is no longer in favour with the U.S. administration who have withdrawn their backing after discovering his extensive human rights violations. Following several interwoven storylines‚Äîthose of Trujillo, his assassins, and the daughter of a man who once served in Trujillo's inner circle of advisers, Urania Cabral‚Äîthis novel reveals both the political and social environment in the Dominican Republic, past and present. The story opens and closes with Urania's story, effectively framing the narrative in terms of remembering and understanding the past and its legacy for the present. = 'Not quite' dictator novels = Latin American novels that explore political themes, but that do not centre upon the rule of a particular dictator, are informally classified as \\"not quite dictator novels\\". For example, Libro de Manuel (A Manual for Manuel, 1973), by Julio Cort√°zar, is a postmodern novel about urban guerrillas and their revolutionary struggle, which asks the reader to examine the broader societal matters of language, sexuality, and the modes of interpretation. In the Time of the Butterflies (1994), by Julia √Ålvarez, tells the story of the Mirabal sisters, whom patriotism transformed from well-behaved Catholic d√©butantes to political dissenters against the thirty-year dictatorship of the Trujillo r√©gime in the Dominican Republic. The novel sought to illuminate the officially obscured history of the deaths of the Mirabal sisters, not to determine what happened to them, but to determine how the Mirabal sisters happened to the national politics of the Dominican Republic. In the mock-diary \\"Intimate Diary of Solitude\\" (third part of El imperio de los sue√±os 1988; Empire of Dreams, 1994), by Giannina Braschi, the protagonist is Mariquita Samper, the diarist who shoots the narrator of the Latin American Boom in revolt against his dictatorial control of the fictional narration. Moreover, in Braschi's most recent work United States of Banana (2011), the Puerto Rican prisoner Segismundo overthrows his father, the King of the United States of Banana, who had imprisoned him for more than a hundred years in the dungeon of the Statue of Liberty, for the crime of having been born. The story of Distant Star (1996), by Roberto Bola√±o, begins on 11 September 1973, with the coup d‚Äô√©tat by General Augusto Pinochet against Salvador Allende, the President of Chile. The writer and professor of literature Raymond Leslie Williams describes the aforementioned novels as not-quite-dictator-novels, which are reminiscent of the genre for being \\"acutely and subtly political fiction\\" that addresses themes different from those of the dictator novel, which cannot be divorced from the politics of the stories, and so each \\"can be read as a meditation on the horror of absolute power\\". Legacy Although it is difficult to establish the exact origin of the dictator novel in the nineteenth century, its intellectual influence spans Latin American Literature. Most of the novels were written in the middle years of the twentieth century, and each has a unique literary style that employed techniques of the \\"new novel\\", by which the writer rejected the formal structure of conventional literary realism, arguing that \\"its simplistic assumption that reality is easily observable\\" is a narrative flaw. As a genre, the dictator novel redefined the literary concept of \\"the novel\\" in order to compel the readers to examine the ways in which political and social mores affect their daily lives. Therefore, the regional politics and the social issues of the stories yielded to universal human concerns, thus the traditional novel's \\"ordered world view gives way to a fragmented, distorted or fantastic narrative\\" in which the reader has an intellectually active role in grasping the thematic gist of the story. Additional to the narrative substance, the novelists redefined the formal literary categories of author, narrator, character, plot, story, and reader, in order to examine the etymological link between \\"author\\" and \\"authority\\", wherein the figure of the novelist (the author) became very important to the telling of the tale. In the dictator novels, the writers questioned the traditional story-teller role of the novelist as the \\"privileged, paternal figure, as the authoritative ‚Äòfather‚Äô, or divine creator, in whom meaning would be seen to originate\\", and so, the novelists fulfilled the role of the dictator.

Purpose of detergents in gasoline  Detergent additives serve to prevent the buildup of engine \\"gunk,\\" which can cause a host of mechanical problems. Automotive journalist Craig Cole writes, \\"Gasoline is an impure substance refined from a very impure base stock ‚Äì crude oil. It‚Äôs an explosive hydrocarbon cocktail containing all kinds of different chemicals. In addition to its own molecular variability, refiners and retailers incorporate additional substances into the mix, from ethanol alcohol to octane enhancers.\\" While General Motors' fuels engineer Andrew Buczynsky claims that no one has identified the exact molecule in gasoline that causes engine buildup, he asserts that consistent use of Top Tier Detergent Gasoline will keep engines cleaner. Engine gunk typically builds up in fuel injectors and on intake valves, and if severe can result in reduced fuel efficiency, acceleration, and power. Left unchecked, engine gunk can also contribute to increased emissions, rough idling, and tendency to stall, and can therefore increase required motor repairs. When fuel injectors accumulate deposits, they do not distribute fuel evenly, creating pockets of too much fuel and too little fuel. Too-little fuel around the spark plug dampens the combustion that drives the piston downward and may cause a misfire. When the frequency of misfires reaches a certain point, the on-board computer turns on the \\"service engine\\" light on the dash. The repair for this type of problem depends on the severity of the deposits. In milder cases, a mechanic may solve the problem by adding a can of fuel-injector cleaner into the gas tank. However, in some cases, the fuel injectors must be replaced. Deposits formed on the intake valves may be removed via walnut shell blasting. In severe cases, a more costly cylinder-head rebuild may be necessary. Certain forms of sulfur that refiners or pipelines may leave in finished gasoline, such as mercaptans and hydrogen sulfide, can contaminate fuel sending units and lead to erratic dashboard fuel gauge readings, which may be expensive to repair. The regular use of a TOP TIER Detergent Gasoline can prevent this from occurring. However, this problem has become less common as manufacturers are now making these units with improved alloys that are less affected by these forms of sulfur. Chris Martin at Honda states, \\"We've supported it [Top Tier gasoline] because we've seen a benefit from it for our consumers in the long run. . . We don't require that our vehicle owners use Top Tier gas [but it helps] make sure the engines are going to last as long as they could.\\"  Characteristics of Top Tier gasoline  In order to be certified as Top Tier, a gasoline must pass a series of performance tests that demonstrate specified levels of: 1) deposit control on intake valves; 2) deposit control on fuel injectors; 3) deposit control on combustion chambers; 4) prevention of intake-valve sticking. Gasoline marketers agree when they sign on to Top Tier program that all their grades of gasoline meet these standards. However, premium grade gasoline may have yet higher levels of detergent additives.Healey, James R.; Woodyard, Chris. Can discount gas crimp your ride?. USA Today. 2007-06-14. Retrieved 2008-04-14. Typically, Top Tier gasolines will contain two to three times the amount of detergent additives currently required by the EPA. The extra additives are estimated to cost less than a cent per gallon.Healey, James R.; Woodyard, Chris. Can discount gas crimp your ride?. USA Today. 2007-06-14. Retrieved 2012-10-17. In addition to the detergent additive requirement, Top Tier gasoline cannot contain metallic additives, because they can be harmful to a car's emissions-control systems. According to its auto industry research and to automotive journalists, all vehicles will benefit from using Top Tier Detergent Gasoline over gasoline meeting the basic EPA standard. New vehicles will supposedly benefit by keeping their engine clean and running optimally, while older vehicles may benefit with increased engine performance and prolonged vehicle life.  History  In the late 1980s, automakers became concerned with fuel additives as more advanced fuel injection technology became widely used in new cars. The injectors often became clogged, and the problem was found to be inadequate levels of detergent additives in some gasoline. The automakers began to recommend specific brands of gas with adequate content to their customers. But some fuel marketers were still not using detergents, and in a move supported by the auto industry, the federal government mandated specific levels of additives. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) introduced the minimum gasoline detergent standardGasoline Detergent Additives Enforcement and Recordkeeping Requirements  Fuels and Fuel Additives  US EPA in 1995. However, the new regulations had unintended consequences. The new EPA standards required lower levels of detergent additives than were then being used by a few major fuel marketers. When the new regulations came in, most gasoline marketers who had previously provided higher levels of detergents reduced the level of detergents in their gasolines to meet the new standard. The EPA detergent additive levels were designed to meet emissions standards but not engine longevity standards. Automakers said they were seeing persistent problems such as clogged fuel injectors, and contaminated combustion chambers, resulting in higher emissions and lower fuel economy. By 2002, the automakers said their repair records suggested that the EPA standard for detergents was not high enough, but the EPA was not responsive when they asked them to increase the standards. These concerns were heightened by plans to introduce a new generation of vehicles that would meet the EPA's ‚ÄúTier Two‚Äù environmental standards for reduced emissions. These vehicles require higher levels of detergents to avoid reduced performance. Cars with gasoline direct injection (GDI) have been especially prone to carbon buildup, and car makers recommend fuels with higher detergent levels to combat the problem. At first GDI was mainly available in high-end autos, but it is now being used in mid-range cars and economy cars, such as the Hyundai Sonata, Ford Focus and Hyundai Accent.Hyundai Gamma engine In 2004 representatives of BMW, General Motors, Honda, and Toyota got together to specify what makes a good fuel. Using recommendations from the Worldwide Fuel Charter, a global committee of automakers and engine manufacturers, they established a proprietary standard for a class of gasoline called \\"TOP TIER\\" Detergent Gasoline The new standard required increased levels of detergents, and restricted metallic content. Volkswagen/Audi joined the group of automakers in 2007. Gas brands can participate and get a TOP TIER license if they meet certain standards, which includes performance tests for intake valve and combustion chamber deposits, fuel injector fouling, and intake valve sticking. Additive manufacturers pay for the testing, the cost of which varies from year to year, while gasoline companies pay an annual fee based on the number of stations it operates to participate in the program. In addition to higher detergent levels, Top Tier standards also require that gasolines be free of metallic additives, which can be harmful to the emissions control systems in cars. In October 2017 a Top Tier Diesel Fuel program was launched. Reception Most of the fuel experts and auto mechanics who have publicly commented on Top Tier gasoline recommend it. A 2007 USA Today article quoted three critics who say it has little or no benefit, but the same article quoted three endorsers of the new standard. Tom Magliozzi, co-host of NPR's weekly radio show, Car Talk, said that using top tier detergent gasoline is only critical on high-end vehicles. For other vehicles, he and another source said that periodic use of a concentrated engine cleaner every 100,000 miles will \\"often\\" clean out carbon buildup. However, journalist and automotive mechanics instructor Jim Kerr says that with some brands of gasoline, deposits can build up on intake valves in less than 10,000 kilometers (6200 miles). And General Motors fuels engineer Andrew Buczynsky says the various engine-cleaning additives available at auto-parts stores should be used with caution. He said some work but most do not, and that care must be taken when using these additives because some may contaminate the catalytic converter. Also, if too much is used, the additive may cling to valve stems and cause them to hang open. Most mechanics agree that consistent use of a fuel with adequate cleaning ability is best. Magliozzi's co-host, Ray Magliozzi, said that in order to be sure of preventing buildup of fuel injectors and valves, motorists should use Top Tier gasoline \\"at least most of the time.\\"Magliozzi, Tom; Magliozzi, Ray; Berman, Doug. Click & Clack: A Real Gas. The Washington Post. 2007-09-02. Page G02. Retrieved 2008-04-14.Allen, Mike. Finding Top Tier Gas. Popular Mechanics. 2007-12-07. Retrieved 2008-04-14. Several others agree: Mechanic Pam Oakes says Top Tier gas is effective in cleaning carbon from engines and is worth buying. She says she's seen the difference it can make and recommends it to all of her customers. Westside Autos in Clive, Iowa, and Motor Age columnist Larry Hammer also recommend Top Tier for removing carbon build-up, adding that a cleaner engine will also burn fuel more cleanly and therefore produce less emissions. Automotive mechanics instructor Jim Kerr concurs: \\"All gasoline is not created equal . . . Top Tier does have benefits.\\"  Availability  In 2004 the standard was adopted by ten gasoline distributors. Chevron and QuikTrip were first, followed that same year by 76 Stations, Conoco, Phillips 66, Road Ranger, Kwik Trip/Kwik Star, Shell, and MFA Oil Company. Since then, many more gasoline distributors have met the proprietary standard and TOP TIER gasoline can now be found in gas stations all over the U.S. and Canada.TOP TIER Detergent Gasoline Marks One YearShell Canada Limited - TOP TIER Detergent Gasoline Top Tier is also available from select brands in Canada, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Panama, and Puerto Rico. Meeting this standard allows gasoline marketers to differentiate themselves from their competition. All stations selling the brand must meet Top Tier standards before the brand is qualified. They must pass separate tests measuring the ability of their gasolines to keep intake valves, combustion chambers, fuel injectors clean, and to prevent intake valves from sticking.

It is meant to exchange floating-point data according to IEEE standard between different computers, to modify them or to convert them into other file formats. It can be used for all kinds of structured data sets. It is mainly used in the field of direct numerical simulations. EAS3 package The complete package consists of libraries intended for usage in own codes and a separate command-line tool. It is written in Fortran and C and runs on all POSIX operating systems. The libraries include different numerical algorithms and subroutines for reading and writing files in the binary EAS3 file format. The read/write routines are provided in Fortran and C. Implemented numerical methods include, for example, Fast Fourier transform, Thomas algorithm and interpolation routines. The libraries are also suitable for vector computers. History EAS3 has been developed at the Institut f√ºr Aerodynamik und Gasdynamik (IAG) of the University of Stuttgart. The previous versions (EAS, EAS2) range back to the end of the 1980s, when computer power allowed the first spatial DNS computations.H. Fasel, U. Rist, U. Konzelmann: Numerical investigation of the three-dimensional development in boundary layer transition, AIAA Journal, Vol. 28, p. 29-37, 1990 The upcoming amount of data required efficient handling and postprocessing. Typically, simulations were, and are still today, performed on a high-performance computer and afterwards postprocessed on other machines of opposite endianness. This required an endianness-independent file format for data handling. Since the publication of EAS3 in the 1999, the software has been developed continuously by members of the involved institutes. Since 2007, EAS3 is also available via the heise software directory.EAS3 page at heise software directory EAS3 is used by applications within the European PRACE project.Website of Partnership for advanced computing in Europe The current version number is 1.6.7 from April, 2009. File Format The EAS3 file format is used to store floating point data in IEEE format and to exchange the files between different computer architectures (little/big endian). The data is organized as parameters with one parameter being a one-, two- or three-dimensional floating point array. Several of these parameters may be combined to one time step. This allows to store five-dimensional arrays. Data can be written in single-precision (32 Bit), double-precision (64 Bit) or quadruple-precision (128 Bit). Geometry information for the different directions are saved in the header of the file. It is also possible to store additional information in user defined arrays there. With the file size being limited only by the computer itself (e.g. file system), EAS3 files are suitable for large simulations and thus for high- performance computing.A. Babucke, M. Kloker, U. Rist: Direct Numerical Simulation of a Serrated Nozzle End for Jet-Noise Reduction, in High Performance Computing in Science and Engineering 07, p. 319-338, , Springer 2008J. Linn, M. Kloker: Direct Numerical Simulation of Film Cooling in Hypersonic Boundary-Layer Flow, in High Performance Computing in Science and Engineering 08, p. 171-189, , Springer 2009 Functionality The actual EAS3 executable is a command-line interface for alteration of EAS3 files. The implemented commands range from basic operations, e.g. simple computations, file operations, to rather complex operations like Fourier transformation or the computation of derivatives. Specific commands for DNS data are also available, e.g. the lambda2 vortex criterion. As the commands are read from standard input, EAS3 may be used in shell scripts for automated calls. Screenshot of EAS3: Computing the spatial derivative along the first spatial dimension. Outline of important functions *file management: rearrangement, attaching two files, cutting *conversion to other file formats (ASCII, Covise, Tecplot) *mathematical operationes: basic operations, logarithm, etc. *derivatives and integration *interpolation *data reduction: mean values, RMS- values, etc. *Fourier transformation: single/double, real/complex *DNS specific: vortex criterion Installation The sources can be obtained directly from the CVS repository or one may download a zipped tar file. Makefiles for different machine types are included, providing an easy compilation. As linking of object files, created with different Fortran compilers can cause problems, binary packages (RPM, .deb) are not offered up to now. Advantages and disadvantages =Advantages= The main profit for the programmer is the easy implementation of reading/writing large (>2GB) binary data sets. The library provides that the data is always written big endian. The resulting platform independence allows data exchange between different hardware architectures, e.g. supercomputers. The users benefits from the different methods provided for postprocessing, which can be automated using shell scripts. =Disadvantages= Being specialized on structured grids may be a problem for some users. Up to now, only cartesian grids or a representation of the data in spectral space are implemented. Data in other types of data alignment, e.g. cylindrical coordinates, can be stored in EAS3 files but the existing postprocessing commands may not be used. As the usually used visualization programs do not support the EAS3 file format directly, it is often necessary to convert the data to the corresponding file format. Commands in the EAS3 program are given by a text interface, a graphical user interface does not exist. Completion of the commands in the EAS3 command line provides support for interactive usage but for an extensive help, the descriptions on the webpage are necessary.

Analyses of core legal paradigms shape the characteristics of individual and distinctive legal cultures. \\"Comparative legal cultures are examined by a field of scholarship, which is situated at the line bordering comparative law and historical jurisprudence.\\"Csaba Varga (ed) (1992) Comparative Legal Cultures (Dartmouth: England) p. xix. Legal cultures can be examined by reference to fundamentally different legal systems. However, such cultures can also be differentiated between systems with a shared history and basis which are now otherwise influenced by factors that encourage cultural change. Students learn about legal culture in order to better understand how the law works in society. This can be seen as the study of Law and Society. These studies are available at schools such as Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa.  Western vs non- Western legal culture  Western legal culture is unified in the systematic reliance on legal constructs. Such constructs include corporations, contracts, estates, rights and powers. These concepts are not only nonexistent in primitive or traditional legal systems but they can also be predominately incapable of expression in those language systems which form the basis of such legal cultures.J.C. Smith (1968) 'The Unique Nature of the Concepts of Western Law' The Canadian Bar Review (46: 2 pp. 191-225) in Csaba Varga (ed) (1992) Comparative Legal Cultures (Dartmouth: England). As a general proposition, the concept of legal culture depends on language and symbols and any attempt to analyze non-western legal systems in terms of categories of modern western law can result in distortion attributable to differences in language. So while legal constructs are unique to classical Roman, modern civil and common law cultures, legal concepts or primitive and archaic law get their meaning from sensed experience based on facts as opposed to theory or abstract. Legal culture therefore in the former group is influenced by academics, learned members of the profession and historically, philosophers. The latter group's culture is harnessed by beliefs, values and religion at a foundational level. Traditional law in Africa is based on natural justice and lacks abstract concepts. This is characteristic of cultures that have an absence of written language which is necessary to elaborate concepts into theory.Max Gluckman (1964) 'Natural Justice in Africa' Natural Law Forum vol: 9 (pp. 25-44) in Csaba Varga (ed) (1992) Comparative Legal Cultures (Dartmouth: England). The doctrines of traditional African law are based on social considerations whereby parties to disputes seek not declarations of right or wrong but rather they seek restitution of social relationships. The trier of fact and law adjudicates between closely related people from communities as opposed to strangers in commerce. Judgments stress the importance of living together in generous, loving kindness, mutual helpfulness and reciprocity. Evidence suggests that 'African law demonstrates that all men, because they live in society, have some theory of rules of justice which they believe arise from reason itself; [and Gluckman's evidence] suggests that Africans may well have formulated, in embryonic form at least, a theory of natural justice coming from human kindness itself.' The Islamic legal system exemplifies law as part of a larger culture where the concepts of knowledge, right and human nature play a central role. A case study by Lawrence Rosen explains the anthropological, procedural and judicial discretion aspects of bringing a case to court in Sefrou, Morocco.Lawrence Rosen (1989) The Anthropology of Justice: Law as Culture in Islamic Society (Cambridge University Press: Cambridge). The case study makes explicit those fundamentals in Islamic society that shape Islamic legal culture and differentiate this from western legal cultures. Rigid procedural rules and strict court room decorum or etiquette which is entrenched in western legal cultures clears the way for a more natural process of dispute resolution. In Morocco, close attention is paid to social origins, connections and identity where these concepts influence a qadi's (judge) judicial interrogation and discretion. While the systems of law found in the western world consist of conceptualisation and implementation that mimic the extrajudicial world only slightly, in the Islamic courts of Morocco, the culture of law being propounded reflects the overall culture of its people. This is attributable to the goals of law in Islamic society, which is not to hold state or religious power as supreme or to develop an exacting body of legal doctrine, but to restore relationships and then facilitate the resolution of disputes independently of rigid precedent.  Western comparisons  The traditional focus between common law culture and civil law culture has been highlighted by court room procedure, whereby the former nurtures an adversarial environment and the latter an inquisitorial one. Indeed no system of court procedure can ever be purely adversarial or purely inquisitorial. In fact France, which subscribes to a civil legal system, historically gave the judge a passive role and left the parties to engage in an accusatorial manner.J. A. Jolowicz 'Civil Procedure and the Common and Civil Law' (pp. 55-78) in Guenther Doeker-Mach and Klaus A. Ziegert (Eds.) (2004) Law, Legal Culture and Politics in the Twenty First Century (Franz Steiner Verlag: Stuttgart). Nonetheless the common law culture predominately consists of oral arguments where legal representors steer the case in search of justice and reinforcement of rights. The use of a Jury in the common law as a judge of fact is unique when compared to civil law systems. The Jury are triers of fact in both civil and criminal cases and this reflects a particular culture of law; namely the direct involvement of society in the legal framework. In France a judge's role as trier of law and fact is merely as an administrator without creating binding legal principle. Hence the civil law culture is more rational, orderly, authoritative and paternalistic. Common law has a culture of judicial inventiveness and even flexibility. Enunciation of principle is not forever paramount but indeed a continuing flow of cases and statutes add to the ebb and flow of the law, whereby 'case law represented the modern man's realisation of his own limitations.'A. G. Chloros (1978) 'Common Law, Civil Law and Socialist Law: Three Leading Systems of the World, Three Kinds of Legal Thought' The Cambridge Law Review (pp. 11-26) in Csaba Varga (ed) (1992) Comparative Legal Cultures (Dartmouth: England) at 84. Further differences include where a civilian lawyer speaks in terms of the law of nature while the common lawyer speaks to reason. It follows that the culture of these legal systems has been moulded by perceptions of justice and the means available to attain it.  Common law comparisons  Legal culture can differ between countries despite their conformity to a similar if not identical legal system. Both the United States and England possess common law systems of law and yet each country embodies a distinctive legal culture. This has been attributable by contrasting both the institutions within the legal system and characteristics of the profession (judges, barristers and solicitors).Richard A. Posner (1996) Law and Legal Theory in England and America (Clarendon Press: Oxford). According to Posner during 1996 there was about 15 times more American judges than English judges but only about 10 times more American lawyers than English lawyers. Posner suggests that English judges have more prestige than American judges and a related point is that the ratio of judges to lawyers is lower in England than the United States. The consequence of this is that the English common law system, as opposed to the American legal system, displays a legal culture of greater prestige and elitism not only in the judiciary but also those who are candidates for the judiciary. In England, and other Commonwealth jurisdictions, barristers are apt candidates for judicial nomination. The reasons for this stem from the common law systems which have a culture to encourage, harness and capture high quality intellect and experience within a concentrated portion of non-judicial officers of the legal profession known as barristers (which includes and accounts for their subsequent appointments to higher ranking queens counsel and senior counsel). Barristers are engaged upon a solicitor's brief instead of direct engagement with the client. This insulation avoids lay persons being taken advantage of by unscrupulous lawyers which is evidently \\"a big problem in the United States, where incompetent lawyers, and known to be such both by judges and by other lawyers, often wow na√Øve clients.\\"Richard A. Posner (1996) Law and Legal Theory in England and America (Clarendon Press: Oxford) at 23. The cost of pursuing litigation influences the culture of each legal system in terms of what society perceives as the net benefit gained from the court and the profession. To litigate similar cases in England and the United States would cost approximately the same; however English courts are not as generous as their American counterparts in awarding damages, especially punitive damages. Therefore the net expected benefit of litigation being greater in the United States encourages a legal culture that is more litigious in nature than England. National character is inherent in the legal institutions of the courts and parliament, their formation and their output in terms of legislation or judgments. For example it has been said that many factors have contributed to the litigiousness of the United States, including: the rights afforded to the people, a written constitution, immigrant origins of its population, racial and ethnic heterogeneity and the wealth and spoils of its population. To this end national character and history influence current legal culture.  Chinese legal culture  The legal culture of People's Republic of China, as well as its social and economic culture, continues to undergo dramatic change since the People's Republic of China's reforms of 1978. Transformation has occurred by legal modernisation whereby a rule of law has been suggested to replace the rule of man. The latter is a characteristic of the traditional rural Chinese society where unwritten rules, personal relationships and trust govern citizens' legal relationships; analogous to gemeinschaft. In the modern society of China, institutional, customary and legal reform (a rule of law that embodies universal rules uniformly enforced by a centralised and bureaucratic state) is necessary to govern legal relations; analogous to gesellschaft. Direct transplants of western legal systems or culture may not provide an adequate rule of law where the life of ordinary Chinese may be marginalised in favour of legal elite who use legal instruments for self-promotion. Furthermore, implanting western legal norms disregards the local culture and relations; thus potentially destroying significant cultural bonds and relationships in the rural community. The traditional rural Chinese legal culture which is premised on personal and informal relations faces erosion unless legal pluralism is promoted. A top down approach in analysing the legal culture of China suggests that both under Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin, China is \\"a country under rule by law, not rule of law.\\"Jianfu Chen \\"To Have the Cake and Eat it too? China and the Rule of Law\\" (pp. 250-272) in Guenther Doeker-Mach and Klaus A. Ziegert (Eds.) (2004) Law, Legal Culture and Politics in the Twenty First Century (Franz Steiner Verlag: Stuttgart). Evidence comes from post Mao-China, where law is seen as necessary for institutionalising and generalising ad hoc policies for economic reform and as maintaining party leadership. Further problems with the Chinese legal culture include a piecemeal approach to law making with an imbalance between law and policy; denials of private law; neglect towards human rights and individual liberties; and poor enforcement of laws. According to Chen, the consensus in China among scholars is that the lack of democracy and rule of law are interdependent concepts whereby \\"the rule of law is legitimate only if it is the product of democratic government.\\"Jianfu Chen \\"To Have the Cake and Eat it too? China and the Rule of Law\\" (pp. 250-272) in Guenther Doeker-Mach and Klaus A. Ziegert (Eds.)

This is where one could look at Taiwan (known officially as the Republic of China) which is a unitary semi-presidential constitutional republic.Taiwan#Political and legal status Taiwan is characterized as a representative democracy. Despite its democratic values underpinned by a constitution based on the German civil law it does not receive wide recognition as a state separate from the People's Republic of China.Civil law (legal system) What is evident with the People's Republic of China experience is that legal culture is susceptible to change in pursuance to socio-economic and political forces. While such a change could be beneficial for portions of the society and international relations, traditional and established cultural methods face extinction.

These plants are shrubs or lianas and are collectively known as caper shrubs or caperbushes. Capparis species occur over a wide range of habitat in the subtropical and tropical zones. Uses and ecology The well- known caper is a pickled flower bud of Capparis spinosa. Caperbushes are mainly used by humans for their fruit, which are rich in micronutrients. C. spinosa, simply known as caper, yields fruit and more importantly flower buds, which are widely used pickled as a vegetable condiment. The fruit of other species, such as karir (C. decidua), are also used for cooking; C. mitchellii and the Wild passionfruit (the local subspecies of C. spinosa) are well-known bush tucker in Australia. Mabinlang seeds (C. masaikai) are eaten as sweets. Mabinlang is also used in Traditional Chinese Medicine. Aspalathos, the root of a shrub contained for example in the sacred Ancient Egyptian incense kp.t (kyphi), is sometimes considered to be C. spinosa. Other species have also recorded uses in herbalism and folk medicine; dedicated research is largely lacking however. Mabinlins are sweet-tasting proteins found in Mabinlang seed (and possibly in other Capparis species); at least one of them is highly resistant to heat. The market for mabinlins is not large, but this is mainly due to insufficient supply rather than to lack of demand. The 1889 book 'The Useful Native Plants of Australia records that Capparis canescens was also referred to as \\"Mondoleu\\" by the indigenous people from Rockhampton area of Queensland and that \\"The fruit is pyriform and half an inch in diameter. It is eaten by the aborigines without any preparation.\\" (Thozet.) Mr. P. O'Shanesy observes that the pulpy part in which these Australian species of Capparis are imbedded is a good substitute for mustard.\\" Caperbushes from arid regions - chiefly C. decidua - are highly useful in landscape gardening, afforestation and reforestation. They can stop soil erosion and preserve agricultural land. Any large-flowered species can be used to attract butterflies. The Crimson Rose (Atrophaneura hector), a spectacular swallowtail butterfly of South Asia, likes to visit flowers of C. spinosa in the winter months for example. Many birds eat ripe Capparis spinosa fruit and seeds. The fruit and seeds of caperbushes are relished by many birds and other animals such as spiny-tailed lizards. Capparis plants are highly important as food for certain Lepidoptera caterpillars, many of them being Pierinae: * Appias lyncida (chocolate albatross) - recorded on C. heyneana and C. roxburghii. * Astraptes fulgerator (two-barred flasher) - recorded on C. frondosa.H√©bert et al.

Biography Rolf Stranger was born in Kristiania. He was the son of Anund Hanssen (1847-1931) and Hilda Theodora J√∏rgensen (1849-1910). He attended St. Hans Haugen school graduating artium in 190. He studied at University of Oslo graduating cand.jur. in 1914. After graduation, he joined the family business Hanssen & Bergh A / S, where he was manager from 1917 to 1953. The company was a wholesaler and clothing manufacturer . During the Occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany, he was imprisoned in Bredtveit concentration camp from November 1943 to May 1944. Stranger was a long-time member of the Oslo City Council serving from 1926‚Äì67. He served as Mayor of Oslo in the periods 1940-1941, 1945, 1955-1959 and 1962-1963. He represented Oslo in the Parliament of Norway in 1945 and was re-elected on one occasion. He had previously served in the position of deputy representative during the terms 1931-1933, 1934-1936 and 1937-1945. Cultural and civic activities Stranger maintained a strong interest in various cultural and civic activities throughout his lengthy career. His was active in film, theater, music and art. From 1924 to 1971, he served as chairman of the Norwegian Trade Fair (Norges Varemesse). He was chairman of the Oslo Nye Teater during the period 1959‚Äì84. In 1982, he established an endowment, Rolf Strangers kulturfon, which finances scientific research in Oslo's cultural history. In 1987, he produced his autobiography Mitt hjertes Oslo (Oslo: Aschehoug, 1987. ). In his honor, the eastern part of R√•dhusplassen in Oslo was named Rolf Strangers plass during 1998. Honours and awards Among his other honors, Stranger was awarded the King's Medal of Merit (Kongens fortjenstmedalje) in gold in 1957 and the Medal of St. Hallvard in 1960. He was made a Knight Grand Officer of the Order of St. Olav in 1965 and holder of Norwegian Commercial Association decorations in gold. He was made a Commander of the Order of Vasa (Sweden) and of the Order of the Dannebrog (Denmark).

After two years of research and development the company began commercial operations in 1991.Edhouse, Simon. Lasers used to Produce Large Format Holograms. Holography Marketplace, sixth edition, Ross Books, 1997, Page 63. A thylacines hologramSituated on of rural farm land from Adelaide, the lab's facilities included a 5√ó6 metre vibration isolation table in a studio with air-lock loading doors, large enough to drive a car onto the main table. The main laser was CW (continuous wave), 6W argon laser built by Coherent Scientific. The company also used a 3 joule ruby pulse laser, built in collaboration with Professor Jesper Munch of the School of Chemistry and Physics at Adelaide University. The company mainly specialized in the production of the large format white-light-viewable rainbow hologram, a type of holography originally invented in 1968 by Dr. Stephen Benton of MIT. IN fact, while all rainbow holograms are white-light-viewable the most commonly known application of the technique has been applied to reflective substrates like PVC (polyvinyl chloride) and PET (poly ethylene terephthalate) and used widely on credit cards and as anti-counterfeiting applications on labeling of products. Australian Holographics applied the principle for transmission rather than reflective viewing conditions. In 1992, Australian Holographics produced a 2√ó1 metre rainbow transmission hologram of a Mitsubishi station wagon car, which was shown at Holographics International '92 conference in London.National Library Of Australia, Video Documentary, http://trove.nla.gov.au/version/29502689 Australian Holographics was particularly notable for the fact that it had signed the first ever commercial joint venture that the South Australian Museum of Natural History had ever entered into, giving the company access to the museum's collection of exhibits.  Creating a large format studio  The AH project necessitated building a large climate controlled studio incorporating a 6√ó5 metre optical table weighing around 25 tons. The system had to allow for both the creation of large-depth scenes for mastering, in addition to affording the space required for the effective production of ultra-large format rainbow transmission and reflection hologram copies. A heavy sand-filled cavity steel construction was used for the table. The suspension system was constructed around nine Firestone air bags connected to a standard pneumatic set-up with needle-valves, ballast tank and compressor. Overhead towers were designed to carry large transfer mirrors at heights of over three metres above the table. These towers were constructed from hollow steel tubes filled with sand. Over the years, lifting systems for the large glass filmholders evolved from hand operated, to mechanical and finally to pneumatic. Using this platform, it is possible to hold flat a 2√ó1 metre piece of film and maintain its stability, and that of the related optics, beneath the 5,000th of a millimetre tolerance for the 4‚Äì8 second exposure.Edhouse, Simon. Holography permeates Art and Commerce? a question of time‚Ä¶. Artlink, Arts in the Electronic Landscape, distribution through Barnes & Noble in the USA, June 1996.  Imaging techniques in large format continuous wave holography  The requirement for stability in the CW (continuous wave) mastering process, has a surprisingly beneficial aspect, in that it allows for the utilization of unstable curtained areas to effectively render invisible unwanted elements in the field of vision.\\"Large-format holography\\", Proc. SPIE 3358, Sixth International Symposium on Display Holography, 368 (February 1, 1998); doi:10.1117/12.301498 http://proceedings.spiedigitallibrary.org/proceeding.aspx?articleid=947178 This trick is still unique to CW and is sorely missed during pulse holography mastering, where the problem is that often too many things are visible and there are limited methods available to conceal them. Thus if a large object is required to apparently float unsupported in space, CW mastering, rather than pulsed, provides the means to easily achieve this illusion. Many important elements involved in producing high quality large format holograms rest not so much with the traditional concerns of holography but rather with aesthetic concerns that relate to table layout, and lighting techniques that endeavor to feature the subject without visual distractions and to control glare and reflections that lead to non-linear noise. The specifications of the vertical film alignment in the holographic camera During the holographic mastering process for large format rainbow transmission holograms the strip of holographic film that becomes the H1 hologram master must be positioned in front of the subject (3D model) in such a way that it is bathed in diffused laser light, but importantly, must be held rigidly and firmly flat against a sheet of glass. Typically, elaborate hydraulic or vacuum systems have been employed to compress holographic film during the exposure process. However this function was achieved at Australian Holographics by the construction of what was referred to as 'the camera'. In fact the camera was a very long and narrow glass box, approximately 2.2 metres long, about 12 cm high and about 6 cm deep. Inside this 'camera' was a loose piece of glass slightly shorter than the length of the camera, but around the same height. The surprising utility of: Johnson's Baby Oil The long strip of holographic film was placed between the loose glass sheet and the front of the camera, and the entire camera box was then almost filled with Johnson's Baby Oil. This unusual element to the high tech array of equipment and processes came about after the exhaustive testing of the refractive index of countless varieties of commercially available oils, and to the surprise of the holographers concerned, none could surpass the efficacy of this product. The function of the oil inside the camera was to act as an agent to cause the camera to flatten the film between the two glass surfaces. As the oil slowly seeped out between the film's surface and the two glass sheets the natural viscosity of the oil maintained an ultra-thin but cohesive layer that had the effect of gradually pulling the two glass sheets together with a level of force sufficient to flatten the film to within the tolerance level that allowed a consistent interference pattern to be recorded on the H1 master.  History  Australian Holographics Pty Ltd. was incorporated in Adelaide, South Australia in 1989 by Dr. David Brotherton Ratcliffe. Dr. Ratcliffe was at the time a Research Fellow in Physics in the School of Physical Sciences, at Flinders University. The senior holographers working with Dr. Ratcliffe were initially Mr. Geoffrey Fox, and subsequently Mark Trinne. In 1992, David Ratcliffe formed GEOLA Labs in Vilnius, Lithuania to concentrate on the manufacture of pulsed Neodymium YLF lasers. In May 1992, Simon Edhouse joined Australian Holographics as Marketing Manager, and became the General Manager later that year. Then the company focused on international science museums. It sold large holograms to museums in Hong Kong, Singapore, Taipei and Japan. In 1993, Sunkung Corporation of South Korea commissioned Australian Holographics to produce an exhibition of ten large format holograms for Expo '93. In October 1993, David Ratcliffe relocated to Europe, and handed operational control of the day-to-day running of the Adelaide studios to Simon Edhouse and his company Multi Cellular Media Pty. Ltd. Simon Edhouse, as Managing Director of Australian Holographics, managed the marketing and overall operations until the Australian facility closed in 1998. In 1994, Australian Holographics produced a series of holographic billboards for the Singaporean military to promote the 'NS Men' (National Service Men) campaignÔºåunveiled by the Singapore Minister for DefenceZhang, Ming Liang, One Picture Two faces, Army People'Ôºà‰∏ÄÂº†Áã¨ÁÖß‰∏§‰∏™Ê†∑ÔºåÁúãÊòØÂÜõ‰∫∫ÂèàÊòØÊ∞ëÔºâÔºå Lianhe Zaobao, May 14th 1994, p. 6.Higgins, David, 'Changing Face of the Military'ÔºåThe Australian, Tuesday May 17th 1994, p. 24. The holograms were rainbow transmissions, and enclosed in a compact viewing enclosure which housed a mirror to extend the light path for optimal viewing conditions. Also in 1994, Multi Cellular Media Pty. Ltd. trading as Australian Holographics, signed a joint venture agreement with the South Australian Museum, giving the company access to the Museum's vast collection of exhibits. A holographic diorama of extinct thylacines One of the first projects undertaken by the new venture was the production of a 1.6√ó1.1 metre rainbow transmission hologram of a family of thylacines. The holographic thylacines, shown standing on a rocky outcrop in a field of dry grass, portrays the now extinct thylacines as a family group, with the small thylacine pup protruding 50 cm in front of the holographic image-plane.Cribb, Julian, 'Holograms give thylacines new life'ÔºåScience & Technology, The Weekend Australian, August 13-14th 1994, p. 45. The finished hologram had its debut at the SA Museum as part of the Inaugural Innovate SA festival in September 1995.Starick, Paul, 'Holograms reflect our progress'ÔºåScience & Technology, The Advertiser, September 13th 1995, p. 8. Image:Hol.Thylacines.jpg The company also produced a 1.5√ó1.1 metre hologram of a Tyrannosaurus rex skull from the S.A. Museum's collection. In 1995, a large series of holograms were produced of satellites and space vehicles. The most notable of these holograms was the giant 2.1√ó1.1 metre rainbow transmission hologram of the MIR Space Station. This hologram showed a 2 x 3 metre scale model of MIR apparently floating high above the Earth. The model of the Earth used in this hologram was custom made by Adelaide artist John Haratsis. It measured 4√ó5√ó.6 metres resembling a thin slice of a much larger sphere. Image:AHmir2.jpg In 1996, a great white shark hologram was produced by the company from a 4.5-metre model made in Queensland by David Joffe. The resulting 1.5 x 1.1 metre rainbow transmission hologram would become the most popular of all the Australian Holographics stock images, being sold around the world to museums, private collections and tourist venues.  Artists working with Australian Holographics  A number of notable artists worked with Australian Holographics from 1990 to the closure of the Australian lab in 1998.

It was split into two new regiments in 1887. The regiment's soldiers were recruited on the island of Gotland. History Gotland National Conscription was raised in 1811 through an agreement, a convention between the people of Gotland and the king. It became Sweden's first military conscript defence with exercise duty even in peacetime. It mobilized nearly 20% of the population and raised four battalions in addition to artillery. The officers were appointed by the king; other commanders were chosen by the congregation.

Definition  The underwriting cycle is the tendency of property and casualty insurance premiums, profits, and availability of coverage to rise and fall with some regularity over time. A cycle begins when insurers tighten their underwriting standards and sharply raise premiums after a period of severe underwriting losses or negative stocks to capital (e.g., investment losses). Stricter standards and higher premium rates lead to an increase in profits and accumulation of capital. The increase in underwriting capacity increases competition, which in turn drives premium rates down and relaxes underwriting standards, thereby causing underwriting losses and setting the stage for the cycle to begin again.\\"Analysis and Valuation Of Insurance Companies.\\" Center For Excellence in Accounting and Security Analysis: Industry Study Two 2 (2003). http://www.columbia.edu/~dn75/Analysis%20and%20Valuation%20of%20Insurance%20Companies%20-%20Final.pdf (accessed 31 October 2012). For example, Lloyd's Franchise Performance Director Rolf Tolle stated in 2007 that \\"mitigating the insurance cycle was the \\"biggest challenge\\" facing managing agents in the next few years\\".Rolf Tolle, The cycle challenge - 12 July 2007, http://www.lloyds.com/News_Centre/Features_from_Lloyds/The_cycle_challenge.htm (accessed 21 August 2007) All industries experience cycles of growth and decline, 'boom and bust'. These cycles are particularly important in the insurance and reinsurance industry as they are especially unpredictable. Lloyd's of London research in 2006 revealed, for the second year running, that Lloyd‚Äôs underwriters see managing the insurance cycle as the top challenge for the insurance industry, and nearly two-thirds believe that the industry at large is not doing enough to respond to the challenge.Lloyd's Annual Underwriter Survey, 2006 http://www.lloyds.com/News_Centre/360_risk_project/Managing_the_cycle.htm (accessed 21 August 2007) The Insurance Cycle affects all areas of insurance except life insurance, where there is enough data and a large base of similar risks (i.e., people) to accurately predict claims, and therefore minimise the risk that the cycle poses to business.  History  The insurance cycle is a phenomenon that has been understood since at least the 1920s. Since then it has been considered an insurance 'fact of life'. Most commentators believe that underwriting cycles are inevitable, primarily \\"because the uncertainty inherent in matching insurance prices to [future] losses creates an environment in which the motivations, ambitions, and fears of a complex cast of characters can play out.\\"Fitzpatrick, Sean, Fear is the Key: A Behavioral Guide to Underwriting Cycles, 10 Conn. Ins. L.J. 255 (2004). Lloyd's counters that this has become \\"a self-fulfilling prophecy\\".Lloyd‚Äôs, Managing the Cycle ‚Äì How the Market can Take Control http://www.lloyds.com/NR/rdonlyres/A27B9CEB-6F19-4364-BD0A-02AA92384544/0/360_ManagingtheCycle06_12_06.pdf (accessed 21 August 2007). More recently, insurers have attempted to model the cycle and base their policy pricing and risk exposure accordingly.  Description  For the sake of argument The cycle has no start. It is a cycle. Obviously. let's start from a 'soft' period in the cycle, that is a period in which premiums are low, capital base is high and competition is high. Premiums continue to fall as naive insurers offer cover at unrealistic rates, and established businesses are forced to compete or risk losing business in the long term. The next stage is precipitated by a catastrophe or similar significant loss, for example Hurricane Andrew or the attacks on the World Trade Center. The graph below shows the effect that these two events had on insurance premiums. File:Myinsurancecycle.JPG After a major claims burst, less stable companies are driven out of the market which decreases competition. In addition to this, large claims have left even larger companies with less capital. Therefore, premiums rise rapidly. The market hardens, and underwriters are less likely to take on risks. In turn, this lack of competition and high rates looks suddenly very profitable, and more companies join the market whilst existing business begin to lower rates to compete. This causes a market saturation and Insurance Cycle begins again.  Dealing with the insurance cycle  While many underwriters believe that the cycle is out of their hands, Lloyd‚Äôs is trying to push for more proactive management of the ups and downs of the industry. In 2006 they published their ‚ÄòSeven Steps‚Äô to managing the insurance cycle: 1. Don‚Äôt follow the herd. Insurers need to be prepared to walk away from markets when prices fall below a prudent, risk- based premium. 2. Invest in the latest risk management tools. Insurers must push for continuous improvement of these tools based on the latest science around issues such as climate change, and make full use of them to communicate their pricing and coverage decisions. 3. Don‚Äôt let surplus capital dictate your underwriting. An excess of capital available for underwriting can easily push an insurer to deploy the capital in unsustainable ways, rather than having that capital migrate to other uses such as hedge funds and equities, or returning it to shareholders. 4. Don‚Äôt be dazzled by higher investment returns. Don‚Äôt let higher investment returns replace disciplined underwriting as base rates creep up on both sides of the Atlantic. Notionally, splitting the business into insurance and asset management operations, and monitoring each separately, is one way to achieve this. 5. Don‚Äôt rely on \\"the big one\\" to push prices upwards. The spectacular insured loss should not be used as an excuse to raise prices in unrelated lines of business. Regulators, rating agencies, and analysts ‚Äì not to mention insurance buyers ‚Äì are increasingly resisting such behaviour. 6. Redeploy capital from lines where margins are unsustainable. There is little that individual insurers can do to alter overall supply-and-demand conditions. But insurers can set up internal monitoring systems to ensure that they scale back in lines in which margins have become unsustainable and migrate to other lines. 7. Get smarter with underwriter and manager incentives. Incentives for key staff should be structured to reward efficient deployment of capital, linking such rewards to target shareholder returns rather than volume growth.Lloyd‚Äôs, Seven steps to managing the cycle, http://www.lloyds.com/News_Centre/Press_releases/Seven_steps_to_managing_the_cycle.htm (accessed 21 August) The Lloyd‚Äôs Managing Cycle report has several problems. It focuses on the industry as a whole being able to work together to reduce the effect of market fluctuations. However, this is somewhat unrealistic, as if underwriters do not write business in a soft market (i.e. at cheap prices for the customer), it will be hard to win this business back in a hard market due to loyalty issues. Rolf Tolle asserts that \\"There is nothing complex about the cycle. It is about having the courage of your convictions to act with strength.\\".Todd, Cycle Challenge Swiss Re argue that instead of ‚Äòbeating‚Äô the cycle, insurers should learn to anticipate its fluctuations. \\"Cycle management is essentially proper timing. Monitoring the market, predicting market trends and accurately assessing prices play an important role\\".Swiss Re, The insurance cycle as an entrepreneurial challenge, http://media.swissre.com/documents/pub_the_insurance_cycle_as_an_entrepreneurial_challenge_en.pdf Accessed 21 August 2007 Swiss Re gave several examples of potential business strategies. One is to write risks at a roughly fixed rate. This is clearly not practical as it does not allow for the cyclical nature of the market. Another is to fail to react fast enough to changes in the market, which leaves a company even more exposed. The recommended strategy is one that relies on prediction of the business cycle and setting premiums based on models and experience.  The future of the insurance cycle  The unpredictable nature of the insurance industry makes it very unlikely that the cycle can be eliminated. For several years Lloyd's have been urging caution in soft periods and restraint in hard periods.

Popular with locals and tourists alike, the market's more than 250 vendors sell fresh fruits and vegetables; baked goods; fish, meat and cheeses; nuts, seeds, and spices; wines and liquors; clothing and shoes; and housewares, textiles, and Judaica. In and around the market are falafel, shawarma, kibbeh, kebab, shashlik, kanafeh, baklava, halva, zalabiya and Jerusalem mixed grill stands, juice bars, cafes, and restaurants. The color and bustle of the marketplace is accentuated by vendors who call out their prices to passersby. On Thursdays and Fridays, the marketplace is filled with shoppers stocking up for Shabbat, until the Friday afternoon sounding of the bugle that signifies the market will close for the Sabbath. In recent years, the 'shuk' has emerged as another Jerusalemic nightlife center, with restaurants, bars and live music. Geography Jaffa oranges and Judaica at Mahane Yehuda. Mahane Yehuda market is bounded by Jaffa Road to the north, Agrippas Street to the south, Beit Yaakov Street to the west, and Kiach Street to the east. The market itself has two major streets: Eitz Chaim Street (the covered market) and Mahane Yehuda Street (the open-air market). Bisecting these two streets are smaller streets that all used to be named for fruits and nuts‚ÄîAfarsek (Peach) Street, Agas (Pear) Street, Egoz (Walnut) Street, Shaked (Almond) Street, Shezif (Plum) Street, Tapuach (Apple) Street, and Tut (Berry) Street‚Äîuntil the municipality changed the name of Agas St. to Yaakov Eliyahu Banai St. History In 1887 the neighborhood of Mahane Yehuda was established on the north side of Jaffa Road. It was founded by three business partners‚ÄîJohannes Frutiger (a German Protestant and owner of the largest bank in Palestine), Shalom Konstrum, and Joseph Navon‚Äîand was named after Navon's brother, Yehuda. On the south side of the street to the west stood another neighborhood, Beit Ya'akov, founded in 1885. At the end of the 19th century, a marketplace was established on an empty lot to the east of Beit Ya'akov and across the road from Mahane Yehuda which was owned by the Sephardi Valero family; this market was known as Shuk Beit Yaakov (Beit Yaakov Market). Here Arab merchants and fellaheen sold their goods to the residents who lived outside the Old City. As the new neighborhoods outside the Old City grew, the Beit Yaakov Market grew apace with more stalls, tents and pavilions. Under Ottoman rule, the market expanded haphazardly and sanitary conditions worsened. In the late 1920s, the British Mandate authorities cleared out all the merchants and built permanent stalls and roofing. Afterwards the market began to be known as the Mahane Yehuda Market, after the larger neighborhood. In 1931 a new section was built to the west of the market by 20 traders, who previously had only temporary wooden stalls in the area. It was later named the Iraqi Market, as many traders of Iraqi Jewish descent acquired shops there. Today the Iraqi Market is located off Mahane Yehuda Street. A halvah seller arranges his wares. In the 2000s, major renovations were made to the Mahane Yehuda Market, including infrastructure work, repaving roads and covering some open areas. The market's Board of Directors worked to make at least some of these changes in response to a decrease in visitors after terrorist attacks in 1997 and 2002 killed 23 people. Changes driven by the Board included renovations to the streets and alleyways, but also included efforts to draw in cafes and boutiques that would entice more middle-class customers who might become frequent shoppers. According to Eli Mizrachi, chairman of the Mahane Yehuda Merchants Association, whereas shoppers used to come to buy produce, the \\"new generation\\" wants a place with entertainment, a place to sit and have a cup of coffee, and a place to shop for gifts. In the mid-2000s, Ethiopian food sellers began to appear in and around the market. In addition, a number of \\"trendy shops and caf√©s\\" began appearing among the market's retail stalls.\\" New \\"non-Middle Eastern\\" restaurants include eateries such as \\"Pasta Basta,\\" specializing in Italian pasta dishes, \\"Fish and Chips,\\" described by one guide book as \\"the only fish and chips bar in Jerusalem,\\"\\"Fish and Chips,\\" \\"NileGuide: for travelers by locals,\\" retrieved September 5, 2012 and \\"Ha'Agas 1,\\" a vegetarian restaurant. Other recent additions to the market's stalls include an espresso bar, \\"hip jewelry\\" stores, and designer clothing \\"boutiques\\". Three new designer clothing stores opened in 2007 alone. Bread and pita vendor. Changes in the market have transformed the area into a \\"night spot,\\" with bars featuring specialty drinks, live music, and singers. The change has been so pronounced that a Jerusalem Post article listed one shuk restaurant as one of the five highest- rated restaurants in the city for romantic dates. The shuk also now hosts special events like the \\"Balabasta\\" dance and music festival, launched in 2010, which attracts large crowds that remain until late at night, in areas that used to be deserted. The annual festival includes street performances, artwork, puppet shows, and events linked to the market's foods, such as chili- eating contests and produce-carving workshops. While some supporters of changes to the market claim that the revitalized shuk has actually helped to revitalize the whole city, others are less enthusiastic about the changes, noting that real estate prices have quadrupled since the 2000s, forcing out many older shops (like vegetable and fish shops) that were staples of the market. They fear that the arrival of chain stores is \\"part of a global phenomenon that may erase local culture\\". Tourism A boutique in the marketplace. Beit Zvul, a storefront synagogue. The Jerusalem Municipality has invested millions in modernizing the center of Jerusalem and creating many pedestrian malls in order to elevate commerce, tourism, and culture. Nir Barkat, mayor of Jerusalem, said, \\"We realized if we wanted to increase our market share of tourism and the time people spend in Jerusalem, nightlife is key\\". In recent years, as part of this strategy, many bars and restaurants have opened in the alleyways of the Mahane Yehuda market to draw young and sophisticated customers. Free Wi-Fi internet access is now available to customers in some of the market's shops. A self-guided tour of the market called \\"Shuk Bites\\" includes a map with a pre-planned route through the market and \\"punch-card\\" vouchers that allow visitors to sample a variety of foods and drinks. Guided shopping and cooking tours are aimed at attracting a \\"new breed of culinary tourists.\\" =Artwork= In 2011 the city-sponsored project \\"Tabula Rasa\\" (Blank Slate) supported urban artwork decorating walls, concrete surfaces, and even the trash bins of the market. Street artist Itamar Paloge, curator for the project, recruited some 30 other artists from schools of art and photography in the city, including Bezalel, Hadassah, and Musrara, in addition to local sculptors, painters, photographers, and various artists, including street artists. Jerusalem mayor Nir Barkat noted that the project is a joint venture between the merchants, the Student Union, and the municipality. Barkat stressed that Mahane Yehuda has become more than a market: it is an important part of the city's public space - and it's a unique part because of the way Jews and Arabs bargain shop side-by-side in its crowded alleyways and streets. Beginning in January 2015 the metal shutters and doors of the shops became an after-hours attraction as they were spray painted by street artist Solomon Souza. Souza's partner in the project, Berel Hahn, arranges permission from the shopkeepers. As of July 2016, Souza had spray-painted more than 150 of the 360 shutters in the market.

The market's new internet website was an initiative of three firms linked to Jerusalem entertainment and tourism: GoJerusalem.com, More Tourism & Gastronomy, and Action Packed Media. Clientele The market's mixture of shops and restaurants, which includes both kosher and halal establishments, attract residents and tourists, Israelis from Jerusalem and other parts of the country, rich and poor, young and old, religious and secular, Jews and non-Jews, including members of the Arab community. An estimated 200,000 people visit the shuk weekly. With the tensions that are often pronounced among different ethnic, religious, and social groups, the shuk has been called \\"a national treasure.\\" Hours of operation Although some restaurants and cafes within Mahane Yehuda remain open on Shabbat and late into the night, food vendors normally follow a Sunday through Thursday schedule 8:00 am‚Äì7:00 pm, and a Friday schedule 8:00 am to approximately 3:00 pm. Sites with entertainment that do remain open late at night normally must adhere to the city's ban on loud music after 11:00 pm, with the exception of Israel Independence Day and Purim, the two days of the year when the ban is lifted. Transportation Several bus lines serve the market at the Agrippas end and Jerusalem Light Rail, has a Mahane Yehuda station on Jaffa Road, across from the market. The new light rail stop has been linked both to the revival of the market and to plans for changes in the area surrounding it. Notable residents and businesses The first generation of the Banai family of actors and musicians originally lived at 1 HaAgas Street at the southern end of the market. In 2000 the Jerusalem municipality renamed this street as Eliyahu Yaakov Banai Street after the family's patriarch. (#1 HaAgas Street has been renumbered as #13 Eliyahu Yaakov Banai Street.) Ehud Banai, a family member, wrote a song entitled \\"1 HaAgas Street\\", which describes the life and atmosphere at the family home. In 1976 Rami Levy opened his first store on Hashikma Street, one of the streets in the Mahane Yehuda district, selling food products to consumers at wholesale prices. Today Rami Levy Hashikma Marketing (TASE:RMLI) is the third largest food retailer in Israel. Holiday markets Merchant selling chickens for kapparot before Yom Kippur, circa 1983. Before Rosh Hashana, the New Year, thousands of shoppers shop in the market for foods based on different holiday traditions: everything from pomegranates, dates, and assorted honey to fish heads.Minsky, Loren, \\"Feeling the holiday spirit at Mahane Yehudah,\\" The Jerusalem Post, September 28, 2011, retrieved September 6, 2012 In the days between Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur, a shuk kapparot (kapparot market) opens beside the Mahane Yehuda Market, where patrons perform the custom of swinging a live chicken over their heads, symbolically transferring their sins to the chicken, which is then slaughtered and donated to the poor. During the days before the holiday of Sukkot, a large tent opposite the Market, in Valero Square, hosts a shuk arba minim (Four Species market), where vendors sell lulavs, etrogs, and other ritual items used on this holiday. For other holidays with traditional foods, such as sufganiyot for Hanukka or hamentashen for Purim, the market offers many selections, sometimes with Purim hamentashen sold by vendors wearing holiday costumes. (featuring photo [page 1] of two Mahane Yehuda vendors wearing costumes while they sell hamentashen) In advance of the Jewish holiday of Tu Bishvat, the Jewish \\"New Year for Trees,\\" the market includes special displays of seeds, nuts, and dried fruits at discounted prices. Terrorist attacks  There have been no terrorist attacks on the market in recent years. Mahana Yehuda is heavily guarded because it was a target for terrorist attacks during the Second Intifada: * 1997 Mahane Yehuda Market Bombings: On July 30, 1997, 16 people were killed and 178 wounded in two consecutive suicide bombings. * On November 6, 1998, two terrorists died when their bombs exploded prematurely. * 2002 Mahane Yehuda Market bombing: On April 12, 2002, a female suicide bomber detonated at the entrance to the market, killing 6 and injuring 104.

Rosenfelt (November 15, 1921 ‚Äì August 2, 2007) was an American executive who served as CEO of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) studio under MGM owner Kirk Kerkorian from 1972 until 1982. Additionally, Rosenfelt spearheaded the acquisition of United Artists by MGM in 1981. Early life Frank Rosenfelt was born to a Jewish family on November 15, 1921. He grew up in New York City. Rosenfelt enlisted in the United States Army during World War II and fought at the Battle of the Bulge. He was wounded during the battle and received a Purple Heart. Rosenfelt returned to the United States after the war and attended Cornell University and the Cornell Law School. MGM Studio career Rosenfelt served as CEO of MGM from 1972 until 1982. Rosenfelt joined RKO Studios in the studio's legal department for five years following his graduation from Cornell Law School. Rosenfelt left RKO in 1955 and joined MGM as an attorney the same year. He received a promotion to general counsel of MGM in 1969. Rosenfelt oversaw a number of important MGM movies during the 1960s and 1970s including 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) and The Sunshine Boys (1975). One of his most important MGM accomplishments was the acquisition of the movie rights for Doctor Zhivago (1965), which was based on the book of the same name by Russian writer Boris Pasternak. The rights to Dr. Zhivago were owned at the time by producer Carlo Ponti. Rosenfelt was reportedly unsure whether writers in the Communist Soviet Union had the right to sell their own intellectual properties and writings. He hired an expert in Soviet law which discovered that Russian writers did indeed retain their property rights. Following this discovery, Rosenfelt hired top Russian speaking literature scholars to translate Dr. Zhivago in a way that would not violate the terms of the contract. Financier Kirk Kerkorian purchased MGM in 1972 and offered Rosenfelt the position of president, chair and CEO of the studio. Rosenfelt accepted the Kerkorian's offer. Rosenfelt headed the MGM negotiations for Kerkorian's and MGM's $380 million purchase of United Artists studios from the Transamerica Corporation, an insurance corporation, in 1981. United Artists was had recently suffered financial losses following the commercial and critical failure of its movie, Heaven's Gate (1980). Rosenfelt stepped down as CEO of MGM in 1982 for personal reasons. He was replaced by Frank Rothman, who was also a lawyer. Rosenfelt was soon named the chief executive of United Artists. He later became vice chairman of the board of the combined MGM/UA, which required a move to London. Rosenfelt also set up his own independent consulting business. He served on board of governors of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences from 1977 to 1985. Rosenfelt was known for his close friendships with a large number of important movie stars, directors, and studio executives during his Hollywood career. He counted comedian George Burns, actor Cary Grant, studio chief Sherry Lansing and film directors David Lean and Stanley Kubrick among his close friends. Death Frank Rosenfelt died in Los Angeles, California, on Thursday, August 2, 2007, at the age of 85. He was survived by his wife, Judith, a daughter and two sons.

This vorticity is a continuum of mini-starting-vortexes. The wake behind an aircraft is a continuous sheet of weak vorticity, between the two trailing vortices, and this accounts for the changes in strength of the trailing vortices as the airspeed of the aircraft and angle of attack on the wing change during flight.\\"This starting vortex formation occurs not only when a wing is first set into motion, but also when the circulation around the wing is subsequently changed for any reason whatever.\\" Millikan, Clark B., Aerodynamics of the Airplane, page 65 (The strength of a vortex cannot change within the fluid except by the dissipative action of viscosity. Vortices either form continuous loops of constant strength, or they terminate at the boundary of the fluid - usually a solid surface such as the ground.) The starting vortex is significant to an understanding of the Kutta condition and its role in the circulation around any airfoil generating lift. The starting vortex has certain similarities with the \\"starting plume\\" which forms at the leading edge of a slug of fluid, when one fluid is injected into another at rest.

Service history =World War II Pacific Theatre operations= Following a period of modifications and shakedown training, Blount loaded cargo and stood out of San Francisco, California, on 16 March. Three weeks later, on 8 April, she arrived at Manus in the Admiralty Islands. The ship spent three days there discharging cargo before returning to sea on the 11th, bound‚Äîvia Biak Island‚Äîfor Morotai in the Netherlands East Indies. Supporting the troops in Borneo and the Philippines She stopped at Biak from 14 to 16 April and arrived at Morotai on the 19th. There, she issued provisions to ships staging for the assault on Tarakan, Borneo. On 29 May, Blount set sail for Borneo and, on 1 June, arrived at Tarakan where she dispensed emergency rations for Australian troops fighting for the island. Two days later, she headed for the Philippines. The cargo ship stopped off overnight on 7 and 8 June at Parang on Mindanao Island to unload supplies before heading back to Morotai. She reached Morotai on 10 June and remained there until the 28th. On that day, Blount stood out to sea and, on 3 July, reentered Seeadler Harbor at Manus. Minor collision with a merchantman Blount remained at Manus for over a month intermittently loading cargo and undergoing repairs for minor damage incurred in a collision with a civilian merchantman that occurred just before she entered the harbor. Blount returned to sea on 7 August, bound for the Philippines. Seven days later, she arrived in the harbor at Cebu City on Cebu Island in the southern Philippines. End-of-war activity On the morning of the 15th, while still at Cebu, Blount received word of the cessation of hostilities with Japan. The cargo ship departed Cebu on 17 August and entered port at Iloilo on Panay Island on the 18th to provision transports with Japan-bound occupation troops embarked. From there, she moved to Puerto Princesa on Palawan Island where she issued provisions to shore stations. Visits to Brunei Bay, Borneo; Tawi Tawi in the Sulu Archipelago; and Tarakan, Borneo, followed. Blount departed Tarakan on 8 September; transited the Makassar Strait; and reached Balikpapan, Borneo, on the 10th. Two days later, the ship stood out of Balikpapan, bound for the Philippines. She delivered provisions at Zamboanga on Mindanao and at Isabela on Basilan Island before leaving the Philippines on the 24th for the Admiralty Islands. The ship entered Seeadler Harbor, Manus, on 2 October and began voyage repairs. Assigned as general cargo ship Blount remained at Manus until mid-November. During her stay, her mission was changed from that of a fleet issue ship to that of a general cargo ship. She departed Manus on 16 November and arrived at Luzon on Christmas Day 1945. =Return Stateside= On 5 January 1946, Blount began the long voyage back to the United States. She arrived in the Panama Canal Zone on 22 February and, after transiting the canal, got underway for Hampton Roads, Virginia, on 2 March.

The building was designed by Arthur Gilman and Edward H. Kendall, with George B. Post as a consulting engineer. The Equitable Life Building was made of brick, granite, and iron, and was originally built with seven above-ground stories and two basement levels, with a height of at least . An expansion in 1885 brought the total height to and nine stories. Construction started in 1868 and was completed in 1870 under the leadership of Equitable's president Henry Baldwin Hyde. It was the world's first office building to feature passenger elevators and consequently became successful with many tenants. The Equitable Life Building was expanded numerous times; after the construction of annexes during the late 1880s, the building occupied its entire block, bounded by Broadway and Cedar, Pine, and Nassau streets. While touted as fireproof, the Equitable Life Building burned down in a fire in 1912, which killed six people. The site was redeveloped with the 40-story Equitable Building, completed in 1915.  Design  The Equitable Life Building was designed by Arthur Gilman and Edward H. Kendall, with George B. Post as a consulting engineer. The building occupied the entire block bordered by Broadway to the west, Cedar Street to the north, Nassau Street to the east, and Pine Street to the south. The Equitable Life Building was made of brick, granite, and iron, and was originally built with seven above-ground stories and two basement levels. This count excluded a pavilion in the mansard roof above the seventh story, which would have counted as an eighth floor. At the time of its completion, the Equitable Life Building was at least tall, though accounts differ on the height, and it may have been as tall as at its peak. An expansion in 1885 brought the total height to and nine stories. The building was composed of five separate structures at its largest extent. Its final height was reported to have been . The building was touted as fireproof, and with then-innovative features such as elevators and electric lighting, is considered to be one of the first skyscrapers. With an ornate arcade, it was described as a predecessor to 20th-century edifices that functioned as \\"micro-cities\\". = Facade = As built, the articulation of the second and third stories was designed as if they were a single story, and a similar architectural treatment was used for the fourth and fifth floors. These horizontal groupings were separated by cornices, but there was no horizontal separation between the second/third and fourth/fifth floors, leading some observers to erroneously describe the Equitable Life Building as five stories. Rather, the double-story sections contained windows measuring . The columns of windows were separated by vertical piers with paired columns. = Features =  Interior  The Equitable offices, on the second and third stories, featured the world's \\"most complete and imposing business hall\\", with a domed space measuring and supported by twelve marble-clad Corinthian columns. Also within the Equitable Life Building were two raised skylights at the top of the ceiling. On the second floor was a marble counter that enclosed a workspace for 150 clerks, while the offices of 40 officers and agents ran along the periphery of the workroom. A gallery enclosed three sides of the third floor, accessed from a spiral staircase from the office of Henry Baldwin Hyde, founder of the Equitable Life Assurance Society, located in a corner of the second floor. Since Equitable occupied the second and third floors, which were seen as relatively unappealing, it was able to rent out the more desirable quarters in the basements, ground floor, and upper floors. The ground floor and the raised upper basement had banking rooms. Three of the banking rooms had marble floors, as did the entrance hall. When the building was renovated in the late 1880s, the lobby was expanded to stretch the entire block from Broadway to Nassau Street. The enlarged lobby was composed of a , arcade lined with convenience shops, post office boxes, a restaurant, and a barber. The arcade also included a barrel-vaulted ceiling with skylights, as well as a mosaic from the Herter Brothers; one critic described the arcade as a \\"marvel of the architect's and builder's art\\", in that respect superseding the nearby 280 Broadway, a grand Italianate department-store building nearby. Also in the lobby was the Cafe Savarin, a French-cuisine eatery on the Pine Street side of the building. A cross-passage stretched from Cedar to Pine Streets. The fourth through sixth floors had 50 offices, which were occupied almost exclusively by lawyers. There was also a law library with nearly 40,000 volumes, as well as a separate insurance library with 8,000 volumes. Prior to the late 1880s, the seventh floor contained suites for the building's janitorial staff; after the renovation, the seventh and eighth floors were furnished with offices, similarly to the fourth through sixth floors. Also in the Equitable Life Building were three dining rooms.  Innovations  The Equitable Life Building was the first office building in the world to feature passenger elevators, with hydraulic elevators made by the Otis Elevator Company. Before the structure's completion, there were three elevators in the city‚Äîone each at the Astor House, the Fifth Avenue Hotel, and a private apartment building‚Äîand office building heights had never exceeded four stories. Hyde had been advised against constructing elevators; at the time, prestigious firms did not rent offices above the second floor, since that entailed climbing more flights of stairs, exhausting the workers. Initially, the Equitable Life Building had two steam elevators, but four more were added during the mid-1870s. Four additional elevators were installed in the late 1880s, bringing the elevator count to 10. The highest rental floor, the seventh story, was in high demand: architect George B. Post took the suite facing Broadway for twice the appraised rental price of that suite. The elevators and the views from the top floors attracted thousands of passersby. In addition to the elevators, the Equitable Life Building had other amenities such as electric lighting. After expansion in 1887, the building had nine steel boilers and three hydraulic pumping engines that could pump per minute, and a engine that powered the lighting fixtures. Securities were stored in a welded-chrome and Bessemer steel vault above the Broadway entrance, which was built in 1899‚Äì1900. The vault had the latest security systems of the time, including doors and time locks. The Equitable Life Building was one of the first buildings in the city to use iron floor beams, and exposed iron was common throughout the interior of the building. Nevertheless, while touted as fireproof, the Equitable Life Building still contained combustible components and non-fireproof materials. The floors were made of wood atop brick- or hollow-tile arches; in turn, the arches were situated between the I-beams, which were made of iron and steel. The roof was made of wood and slate. Dumbwaiters in the tile shaft had wooden doors and platforms, while the rest of the building had massive hardwood trim, wooden window sash, and wood-and-glass partitions that were ineffective against fire. The Equitable Life Building also had no automatic sprinklers or chemical extinguishers. The storage vaults were fireproof and survived the 1912 fire. = Artwork = The sculptor John Quincy Adams Ward was hired to make \\"Protection\\", a group of statues for the facade of the Equitable Life Building. Ward carved a group that resembled a vignette used on Equitable's insurance policies. Due to defects in the first carving, Ward commissioned a second carving weighing , which was made from one block of marble. The final carving depicted a goddess protecting a widow. This sculptural group was carved in Italy and was unveiled when Grand Duke Alexei Alexandrovich of Russia traveled to the United States in 1871. Badly corroded by rain, it was removed in 1886‚Äì1887. The heads survived removal and passed through various ownership. Ward's statue commemorating Hyde was unveiled in 1901. It was placed in the building's corridor. The statue survived the fire that burned down the building. Other statues lined the other halls and stairs in the building. The Herter Brothers mosaic in the lobby was described as being \\"the largest in America\\" when it was completed in 1887. The mural was composed of a draped woman with two draped children, flanked by nude figures of Greek warriors.  History  = Context = When Equitable was founded in 1859, the company's first \\"home office\\" was located at 98 Broadway, in the same building as Hyde's previous employers, the Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York. At the time, American life insurance had begun \\"to take on the properties of an important institution\\" according to the National Park Service, and life insurance firms were some of the first companies to build high-profile skyscrapers. Further, many firms in the Financial District were building to the north of Wall Street, the traditional center of commerce in the neighborhood. Hyde was a member of the Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church, which helped contribute funding to get Equitable started. William C. Alexander, brother of the church's pastor James Waddel Alexander, was Equitable's first president. The company grew quickly and moved to 92 Broadway in December 1859; at the time, Equitable had $1.14 million of insurance in force (equal to $ million in ). Initially, Equitable occupied four rooms on the second floor, but by 1862, Equitable leased additional space on the third floor. This was followed in the mid-1860s by Equitable's leasing of more space at 94 and 96 Broadway, which were owned by different landlords. By 1867, Equitable had $82.5 million of insurance in force (equal to $ million in ). = Planning, construction, and expansions = Trinity Church's cemetery The company's success led Equitable's board to hold a meeting in December 1865, on the basis that Equitable needed extra space and had already suffered two fires. Over the next two years, the company acquired seven lots at 116‚Äì124 Broadway and 84‚Äì86 Cedar Street; the lots totaled and had cost on average. When Hyde suggested to Equitable's building committee that he wanted to build an eight-story edifice, the committee viewed the proposal skeptically, to which Hyde stated that he would include elevators. The committee also looked at buildings in other cities across the U.S., as well as hosted a building competition with eleven contestants, which Gilman and Kendall won. Subsequently, in January 1868, Equitable's building committee authorized the erection of a structure to plans by Gilman and Kendall. The seven buildings were demolished, and construction on the lots at Broadway and Cedar Street commenced in 1868. The first portion of the structure was finished on May 1, 1870. The building had cost nearly $4.16 million (equal to $ million in ). Despite Equitable's growing assets‚Äîwhich had increased from $5 million in 1868 to $11 million in 1870‚Äîcompetitors and the public accused the company and Hyde of \\"extravagance\\". The Equitable Life Building was more lavish than other office buildings, due to its construction materials and usage of elevators. The building was profitable, earning $136,000 a year in rent by 1871, with 400 people working inside the building. Its features led other landlords to add elevators and additional floors to their buildings. Equitable's operations increased further so that, by 1872, workers were cramped for space, leading the company to purchase property to the rear and create a law library. The lots at 122-124 Broadway were leased to a Delmonico's restaurant. The New York Times wrote in 1875 that the building's site and facilities allowed it to \\"embrace[] perhaps greater advantages than any other commercial building in the City\\". A large expansion commenced in March 1875 was completed two months later. Electric lighting was added on a trial basis in 1878, making the Equitable Life Building the city's first office building with such lighting. The Equitable Life Building was extremely profitable: in 1892, Equitable's annual income from renting was estimated to be $300,000, which real-estate developers estimated was 4% of the true value of the building. In 1885, Equitable filed plans with the New York City Department of Buildings to build a large extension to the Equitable Life Building. Several lots on Broadway and Pine Street, measuring , would be acquired for the annex. The mansard roof would be removed and replaced with the eighth and ninth stories. The expansion was completed by 1887. It was during the late-1880s expansion that the block- through lobby was added, and the Cafe Savarin was opened. At the time, the Equitable Life Building occupied the entire block except for the corner lots on Nassau Street. Author R. Carlyle Buley stated that Equitable did not assume control of the entire block until 1906, when it bought the lots at 17 and 23‚Äì25 Nassau Street. These buildings were respectively the Belmont Building and the Western National Building, which were never subsumed by the Equitable Life Building. Post was asked to prepare plans for a 40-story structure in 1897, though the design was ultimately not executed. The securities vault and the statue of Hyde were added at the end of the 19th century. By 1900, the Equitable Life Building had over 3,000 occupants. In 1907, Daniel H. Burnham's company D. H. Burnham & Company had proposed replacing the Equitable Life Building with a 33-story structure (later changed to a 62-story building), but the plan was ultimately dropped. Rather, Equitable constructed the Hazen Building on nearby Greenwich Street to store its files. =Destruction= 1912 fire The Equitable Life Building, described as fireproof, was destroyed by a massive fire on January 9, 1912. The fire started in the basement at about 5:00 a.m. EST, but quickly spread to the rest of the building, exacerbated by the presence of open stairway and elevator shafts. Fire crews from Manhattan and Brooklyn were called to put out the blaze, holding up traffic on the Brooklyn Bridge and nearby streets. The outside temperature at the time was , causing the water from the fire trucks to freeze on the building. The tower's height was a disadvantage: fire trucks' ladders could not reach the upper stories, and lifelines from nearby buildings snapped before they could be secured onto the building. There were several high-profile rescues, including that of William Giblin, president of major tenant Mercantile Safe Deposit Company, who had been trapped in a vault. The fire was brought under control at about 9:30 p.m. EST. Smoke continued to billow from the site two days later, and two of the outer structural walls remained standing after the blaze. Six people died, including five employees and one firefighter. Three of the victims had been trapped on the roof while trying to escape. The money in the vaults, appraised at $385 million, was unscathed. Though the building was not covered by insurance policies, Equitable suffered relatively little losses, since the building was valued at less than $3 million, the amount that the company had saved by self-insuring its properties. Damage was estimated at $2 million, but the structure was considered \\"no asset\\"; namely, it was worthless because of the high demand for vacant land in the Financial District. Most of the losses were in the value of the building's law library. The land was actually worth more after the fire than beforehand. Equitable quickly set up temporary quarters at the City Investing Building. The society also sold the land to T. Coleman du Pont in October 1912 for $13.5 million. Du Pont developed the present Equitable Building, designed by Ernest R. Graham & Associates, on the same plot between 1913 and 1915. The massive bulk of the newer building was a major impetus behind the city's 1916 Zoning Resolution, which placed limits on building height and shape.

During McBride's tenure as owner of the Browns from 1944 to 1953, the team won five league championships and reached the championship game two more times. It was the most successful period for a Cleveland sports team in the city's modern history. McBride was also a real estate developer and investor active in Cleveland, Chicago and Florida. He owned taxi-cab companies in Cleveland and a horse racing news wire that sold information to bookmakers. He had ties to organized crime figures arising from the wire service, but was never arrested or convicted of a crime. Early career McBride was born in Chicago, where he worked as a newsboy from the age of six. His first real job was for publishing tycoon William Randolph Hearst's organization in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Boston and Chicago. He moved to Cleveland in 1913, when he was in his mid-twenties, to be circulation manager for the Cleveland News. It was a time when circulation battles over newsstands and street corners often turned violent. He started with the News on a $10,000 salary ($ in today's dollars) and was charged with organizing the paper's newsboys. \\"This meant choosing strong young men comfortable fighting with fists, clubs, knives, chains and, when they could get them, handguns,\\" author Ted Schwarz wrote. \\"They were the business equivalent of the street gang, and McBride's salary depended on how well he organized his newsboys to avoid losing their corners to one or more violent rivals.\\" Having built up a fortune in newspapers and purchased apartment buildings in the Cleveland suburb of Lakewood, McBride in 1930 went into business for himself. In 1931, he bought a majority stake in Cleveland's Zone Cab Company, which later merged with the Yellow Cab Company to form the city's biggest taxi operator. He also had taxi businesses in Akron and Canton, two cities southeast of Cleveland. As his taxi businesses prospered, McBride invested in real estate in Cleveland, Chicago and Florida. In the late 1930s, he leveraged his newspaper connections to launch a wire service that supplied bookmakers with the results of horse races. This put him in contact with organized crime figures who were behind gambling operations that relied on such services. He invested in the Continental Press and Empire News, both based in Cleveland and run by mobsters Morris \\"Mushy\\" Wexler and Sam \\"Gameboy\\" Miller. James Ragen, another friend and associate in the wire business, was murdered in 1946 in a Chicago gangland feud. A federal grand jury in 1940 indicted 18 people, including McBride and Wexler, over the supply of information used in gambling. The allegations were based on federal laws that forbade interstate transmission of lottery results; prosecutors treated the race results as lottery lists. He was never arrested or tried over his role in the business, however. Cleveland Browns McBride was a fan of boxing and baseball, but knew little about football. He only grew interested in the sport in 1940, when his son Arthur Jr. was a student the University of Notre Dame and he attended Notre Dame Fighting Irish football games in South Bend, Indiana. He was drawn by the excitement that surrounded football and thought a professional team could be profitable. In 1942, McBride made overtures to supermarket heir Dan Reeves about buying his Cleveland Rams, a National Football League team, but Reeves rebuffed him. In 1944, however, Chicago Tribune sports editor Arch Ward proposed a new professional league called the All-America Football Conference. McBride, who knew Ward from his days in the newspaper business, eagerly signed on as the owner of the eight-team circuit's Cleveland franchise. McBride first set his sights on Notre Dame's Frank Leahy as his team's head coach, and the two men shook hands on a deal to make him coach and general manager. Not wanting to lose Leahy, however, Notre Dame's president objected and McBride backed off. He then asked Cleveland Plain Dealer sportswriter John Dietrich who he should hire. Dietrich suggested Paul Brown, the Ohio State Buckeyes coach who was then serving in the U.S. Navy and coaching a team at the Great Lakes Naval Training Station outside of Chicago. With his limited football knowledge, McBride had never heard of Brown, and it was Ward who made the initial approach. McBride later met with Brown, whose star was on the rise after bringing Ohio State its first national championship in 1942, and offered him $17,500 a year ($ in current dollar terms) ‚Äì the biggest salary for any football coach at any level ‚Äì and an ownership stake in the team. He also offered Brown a stipend for the rest of his time in the military. Brown accepted the position, saying that while he was sad to leave Ohio State, he \\"couldn't turn down this deal in fairness to my family.\\" McBride spared no expense in promoting the team and gave Brown full control over personnel. Brown went out and signed future stars including tackle and placekicker Lou Groza, wide receiver Dante Lavelli and quarterback Otto Graham, who got $7,500 a year and a $250 monthly stipend until the end of World War II. McBride then held a contest to name the team in May 1945; \\"Cleveland Panthers\\" was the most popular choice, but Brown rejected it because it was the name of an earlier failed football team. \\"That old Panthers team failed,\\" Brown said. \\"I want no part of that name.\\" In August, McBride gave in to popular demand and christened the team the Browns, despite Paul Brown's objections. As the team prepared for its first season in 1946, McBride stepped aside and let Brown run it. The Browns were an immediate success, both financially and on the field. A capacity crowd of 35,964 saw the Browns play their first preseason game at the Akron Rubber Bowl, and the team led all of football in attendance in 1946 and 1947. The Browns, meanwhile, won every AAFC championship between 1946 and 1949. McBride proposed for the Browns to play an inter-league championship game with the National Football League champion Philadelphia Eagles in 1948 and 1949, but the NFL shot down the idea. He also played a role in negotiating peace between the AAFC and NFL after competition for talent drove up player salaries and ate into owners' profits. After the 1949 season, the AAFC dissolved and three of its teams, including the Browns, merged into the more established NFL. In the Browns' early years, Paul Brown wanted to keep on reserve a number of promising players who did not make the team's official roster. McBride made this happen by putting the reserves on his payroll as taxi drivers, although none of them were asked to drive cabs. This group came to be known as the \\"taxi squad\\", a term still in use to describe players kept on hand to fill in for injured team members. The taxi squad was just one of the ways in which McBride backed Brown. He viewed owning the team as primarily a civic duty ‚Äì as a gift to the city. \\"Cleveland has been good to me,\\" he said in a 1947 interview. \\"I've made a great deal of money here. If I was looking for a get-rich-quick investment, the last thing I'd do is buy a pro football club. It's a risky business. Too much depends on ideal weather conditions, and this is no climate to risk a buck on a raindrop.\\" The Browns continued to succeed upon entering the NFL in 1950, winning the championship that year and reaching the title game in both 1951 and 1952. In January 1951, McBride testified in nationally televised hearings before the Kefauver Committee, where he was questioned about his Continental Press Service and alleged ties to organized crime and illegal gambling. It emerged that McBride partnered with Cleveland police captain John Fleming in real estate deals and had Fleming on the Yellow Cab payroll until 1941. McBride denied the mafia connections, claimed he never broke the law and was never charged with any crime. Congress later passed legislation making such wire services illegal. During the summer before the 1953 season, McBride sold the Browns for $600,000 ($ in today's dollars), more than twice the largest sum ever paid for a professional football team. The old stockholders were McBride and his son Edward, along with minority owners including taxi business associate Dan Sherby, Brown and four others. The buyers were a group of prominent Cleveland men: Dave R. Jones, a businessman and former Cleveland Indians director, Ellis Ryan, a former Cleveland Indians president, Homer Marshman, an attorney who had founded the Cleveland Rams, Saul Silberman, owner of the horse race track later known as Thistledown Racecourse, and Ralph DeChairo, an associate of Silberman. While McBride never said so, the Kefauver hearings and the growing public association between him and the mafia may have played a role in his decision to get out of football. McBride said he had simply \\"had his fling\\" with football and wanted to concentrate on other business activities. \\"Well, I came out clean after all,\\" he said. \\"Considering what happened to some of the other fellows who started the old All-America Conference with me, this isn't so bad. I never made anything, but I didn't lose anything either, except maybe a few thousand dollars.\\" McBride's tenure as owner was viewed favorably, partly because of the Browns' on-field success but also because he gave Paul Brown a free hand to coach and sign players. One of the new ownership group's first acts was to assure Cleveland fans that Brown would retain complete control over the football side of the operation. Later life and death McBride continued to direct his taxi and real estate businesses after he sold the Browns, but he kept out of the public eye. He died of a heart attack at the Cleveland Clinic and was buried in Cleveland's Holy Cross Cemetery. He was married to the former Mary Jane Kane. They had three children: Arthur B., Jr., Edward and Jane.

The village consists of a cluster of cottages around the redundant Church of St. Mary Magdalene, which dates from the 14th and 15th centuries and is in Perpendicular style. The church is currently in the care of the Friends of Friendless Churches charity. To the south of the church is a manor house dating from the 14th century. In the year 1724, several Roman urns, containing burnt bones and ashes, were discovered in this parish. During the 1970s archaeological excavations were carried out for a number of summers under the direction of Professor Guy Beresford. These revealed that during the 12th and 13th centuries there were approximately nine crofts lying to the north of the church and possibly three others close to the northwest boundary of the present manor garden. The population declined heavily during the mid-14th century, mainly due to the Black Death; no subsidy was paid in 1428 indicating that by then there were less than ten householders. The excavations demonstrated that after the manor was granted to the Priory the lands of the peasantry were gradually amalgamated.Hertfordshire Genealogy References External links *Friends of Friendless Churches Villages in Hertfordshire Civil parishes in Hertfordshire North Hertfordshire District ","title":"Caldecote, Hertfordshire"},{"id":"12871044","text":"Calder is a small hamlet in Cumbria, England.

The website, which launched in October 2013, is the country's most significant aggregation of resources for helping universities make their campuses accessible for students with disabilities, and is a further step towards helping Ontario universities comply with the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act. =Future Further= Future Further is a dedicated resource that provides information on supports and services to Aboriginal students interested in, or already attending an Ontario university. The website features profiles and videos of 13 Aboriginal role models who are studying at, or have recently graduated from, an Ontario university, as well as resource kits for Aboriginal students interested in attending university. The website is part of COU's 'Let's Take Our Future Further' campaign launched in February 2016 on behalf of the province's 20 publicly funded universities, which aims to celebrate the achievements and contributions of Aboriginal learners and alumni at Ontario universities and to encourage current students to continue to pursue and complete their studies. The COU campaign follows a report by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which put a spotlight on the need to ensure equitable access to postsecondary education for Aboriginal students. =My Career Info= My Career Info is a not-for-profit career site developed and run by the Council of Ontario Universities. The site is designed to help students, graduates, and entry-level workers access campus career services, build a strong portfolio, gain budgeting skills, and find a job that fits with their education, skills and interests. They update the site regularly with the latest news from the job sector, including new job apps, resume and interview tips, and career advice. It is designed to help students incorporate career planning directly into their degree. =Research Matters= Research Matters is a joint project among Ontario's 21 publicly assisted universities to build new bridges between university researchers and the broader public. It is a multi-platform endeavour that involves a website and blog, social media, and public events ‚Äì all designed to give Ontarians unprecedented access to the wealth of ideas and innovations happening at Ontario universities. In 2013-2014 year, Research Matters held events in five different cities across Ontario, hosting researchers who answered the question \\"What Matters Now?\\" The theme for the speaker series in the previous year (2012-2013) was \\"Life in 2030,\\" where researchers would look at how their research could affect life in 2030. Research Matters ran a popular Ontario-wide Virtual Scavenger Hunt from Feb. 3 - Mar. 2, 2014 that featured the various research projects going on at each of COU's 21-member universities. The contest was designed by a fourth- year University of Toronto student Stacy Costa, who is studying to be an \\"enigmatologist\\" - someone who studies all things puzzles.  Ontario's Universities - #Futuring Conversation  From September 2016 to Fall 2017, Ontario's Universities engaged with Ontarians about the future of the province through roundtables and consultations, conferences and focus groups, online, and through email and social media. The #futuring conversation has included discussions about jobs, service sectors, arts and culture, the environment and natural resources, health and well-being, diversity and equality, and building strong communities. This feedback will inform a discussion among Ontario's 21 publicly funded universities about how they can partner with Ontarians to create a brighter future. COU Contests =Innovative Designs for Accessibility (IDeA) Competition= The Innovative Designs for Accessibility (IDeA) student competition is an annual competition where students submit innovative, cost-effective and practical solutions to accessibility-related barriers in the community. Ontario undergraduate students use their creativity and work individually or in teams with industry, government and community partners, including members of the disability community, to identify an accessibility-related issue, develop a plan to address the issue, and create an innovative and unique solution to it. The winner of the 5th annual IDeA competition, announced in May 2016, was Carleton University undergraduate student Micah Rakoff Bellman, who developed a height-adjustable, movable table with built-in storage that provides home cooks with a comfortable and flexible work surface in the kitchen. Past winners include: 2015: Carleton University undergraduate student Quayce Thomas designed an app that promotes healthy active living by checking in to make sure users are meeting the goals they've shared with their social network. 2014: Carleton University's Jasmine Yeung developed a portable toilet that can expand by four times the usual size to make life easier for people in wheelchairs, but can shrink for easy transportation. It is called E-Paw, or the Expandable Portable Accessible Washroom. 2013: Carleton University undergraduate students Tim Inglis, Alim Baytekin, Natalie Lavasseur and Alborz Erfani for their invention of a lower- cost, more functional prosthetic hand that could be produced via a 3-D printer. 2012: Carleton University's Will McDonald developed Accessible Tandem Cycling, which is designed to provide an accessible cycling experience. Ontario University Graduate Employment Outcomes Every year, the Ontario government conducts a survey of Ontario university graduates who graduated two years prior. The survey is conducted by an independent research firm - CCI Research Inc - and looks at the employment rates, earnings, skills match, and subject matter match of university graduates six months and two years after graduation. The latest survey of Ontario university graduates showed that 93.6 per cent of graduates were employed two years after graduation, and the average salary for university graduates in full-time jobs was $49,200 two years after graduation. COU has released two University Works reports, looking at the labour market outcomes for Ontario university graduates. The most recent University Works report, released in June 2015, showed that Ontario university graduates have experienced the highest employment growth of any group of students over the last 10 years; they are also earning significantly more, and are more likely to be working at a job related to their studies. Economic Impact of Ontario Universities According to a 2017 report from the Council of Ontario Universities, the economic impact of Ontario Universities on the province is $115.8 billion, the equivalent of 18 per cent of the province's GDP, and generates more than 478,000 full-time-equivalent jobs in Ontario. The economic impact includes the effects of spending related to university activities, developing talent, and the estimated impact of research and development.

The range was discontinued between 2011 and 2014 and Ez-Play Railway succeeded the range in 2015-2016 while reusing the molds from the GeoTrax rolling stock. History Fisher- Price GeoTrax Rail and Road Systems, first released in 2003, consist of train engines, train cars, tracks for building layouts, and several playsets that can be used with the tracks and road sets. GeoTrax trains and toy vehicles can be used for push along play or be operated by battery powered remote controls that enable sounds and actions. Some GeoTrax toys are modeled after well-known trains. Adding more sets and track to expand the layouts is the goal of GeoTrax collectors. Children 2¬Ω and older are the main users of this toy. As of 2018, the GeoTrax product line has been discontinued. GeoTrax toy types GeoTrax toys are categorized as Rail, Construction, Rescue, Elevation, Air and Sea, and City playsets. The Rail sets vary from small basic pieces that include an engine and one or more cars, to larger sets of 30 or more pieces that can be configured in a number of ways. Separate water works, tunnel, crane, and freight loading toys comprise the Rail playsets. Several Rail playsets include a remote controlled engine and cars with tracks and other pieces such as trees and signposts. Rescue playsets include fire stations, rescue response vehicles, and toy police cars and ambulances. Construction sets come in mining, trucking, fork lift and digging toy variations. The Elevation playsets include mountains, bridges and clock tower toys. Lighthouses, airports, seaplanes, jet planes, fishing piers, trains, drawbridges and tugboats make up the Air and Sea sets. Extra track is available to expand the playsets. GeoTrax figures In 2007, GeoTrax train cars began to include miniature figures of conductors and passengers. These sets containing humans (typically one or two) and trains are identified according to ‚Äúteams‚Äù‚Äîthereby giving GeoTrax train cars personalities and presenting additional play options. \\"Team‚Äù sets are available individually or in conjunction with GeoTrax playsets such as the Chop ‚Äòn Haul Sawmill or the Rope ‚Äòn Ride Ranch. GeoTrax layouts GeoTrax train set layouts come in beginner, intermediate, advanced and expert levels, and are built around playset Rail, Construction, Rescue, Elevation and Air and Sea focal point toys. GeoTrax's appeal is due in part to the number of possible track configurations that can be created with interchangeable track and playsets. GeoTrax is known for its Snap-Lock track which can be locked together or taken apart to create a multitude of track configurations. Layouts can be set up flat or using elevated tracks, and can incorporate curves, ramps and bridges. Some adult assembly is needed to build the track layouts. The assembly process sometimes involves using a Phillips screwdriver and snapping tracks together to create multiple play levels. Users can learn to build a number of prescribed layouts by visiting the GeoTrax site which shows pieces and sets used in each layout and printable pictures of the layouts. Animated Series Geotrax had an animated series that ran from 2007-2009. It had 2 episodes in 2007, 1 episode in 2008, and 1 episode in 2009. All 4 episodes were released on DVD in 2009 after the episode \\"Steamer And Samuel Save The Day\\" was released. Recall On September 4, 2007, some Geotrax trains were recalled by Mattel due to lead-based paint.

Martial arts have been practiced by the Matayoshi family for over 9 generations and draw influence from Japanese, Chinese and indigenous Okinawan martial arts styles. History In the early 20th century Matayoshi Shinko ÂèàÂêâÁúûÂÖâ was asked to demonstrate Kobudo to the Japanese Emperor. He did this twice alongside the likes of Chojun Miyagi and Gichin Funakoshi. Following the death of Matayoshi Shinko in 1947, his son Shinpo, continued his father's legacy by teaching kobudo. Matayoshi Shinpo started a dojo in the 1970s in memory of his father and called it the Kodokan ÂÖâÈÅìÈ§®. From the Kodokan he taught a wide variety of traditional weapons associated with Okinawan peasants. In 1972, Matayoshi Sensei created the Zen Okinawan Kobudo Renmei as an organisation dedicated to the teaching and studying of Okinawa Kobudo. Following the death of Shinpo Matayoshi in 1997, Matayoshi Kobudo practitioners now find themselves split into different organisations. Thanks to the extensive teaching of Matayoshi Shinpo and his students, Matayoshi Kobudo has great influence and respect around the world and an estimated 2000 dojos can now be found worldwide.

Personal life and education James Michalopoulos, born James Mitchell, was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 1951. His father Demetrius Anastasiou Michalopoulos, a Greek immigrant, was an architect who helped shape the Pittsburgh downtown. He is also the nephew of Abstract Expressionism painter William Baziotes, whose works filled his home. He attended and graduated from Bowdoin College. After graduating, he moved to New Orleans, Louisiana. He lives and works primarily in New Orleans. He also has a home in Burgundy, France. Work as a professional artist Michalopoulos took art classes at the New Orleans Academy of Fine Arts and the University of New Orleans. He worked in Jackson Square as a street artist, drawing sketches of people in the square and drawing portraits of people for $2‚Äì3 each. Becoming tired of drawing portraits, he started traveling around the city with a portable easel, painting the buildings and architecture of New Orleans. He began selling his work in the French Quarter.

Michalopoulos' work is in the collections of the New Orleans Museum of Art and the Ogden Museum of Southern Art. =Process= It has been said that \\"there is perhaps no living artist more deeply tied in the mind of the public to the visual landscape of New Orleans than Michalopoulos.\\"Sumrall, Bradley, Walzing the Muse, Ogden Museum of Southern Art exhibition catalog, 2017 His oil paintings are colorful and feature \\"exaggerated viewpoints and skewed perspectives.\\" He uses palette knives in his work, which helps provide intense color and texture. The subjects of his sculptures range from fish and fire hydrants to immense gestural studies of color and form in metal. Michalopoulos can complete an oil painting within two to three days. He leaves \\"completed\\" paintings in his studio for weeks and continues to add to paintings as he feels is necessary. Works are then sent to art galleries. At gallery openings, he has brought his palette to touch up paintings on the spot. When painting singer Aaron Neville, he used photographs of the singer to create the portrait painting titled Heart Song. The painting was inspired by Neville's cover of Leonard Cohen's \\"Bird on the Wire.\\" Further reading *Michalopoulos, James. Michalopoulos. New Orleans: Cattywompus Press (1997). .

Overview Cutaway bodies are mainly of interest when discussing acoustic guitars and semi- acoustic guitars; virtually all solid body guitars either have at least one cutaway, or have a body shape (such as the flying V guitar) which does not intrude into the upper neck area. Some manufacturers denote instrument models with cutaway using the suffix C, such as the Gibson L5C or the Maton CW80C. Types There are two main types of cutaways: Venetian and Florentine. A Venetian cutaway has a rounded bout. A Florentine cutaway has a sharp bout. The terms probably originate with the Gibson Guitar Corporation and probably do not reflect historic instrument-making practices of Florence and Venice. \\"Q: Can you explain the origins of the terms Venetian cutaway and Florentine cutaway? ‚ÄîRobert Manzoni / A: Venetian and Florentine refer to the actual shape of the cutaway: Venetian describes the rounded cutaway and Florentine the sharp, pointed form. The original use of these terms can be traced to early Gibson nomenclature in advertising material and catalogs. ...there isn't any evidence that these cutaway styles actually came from Venice or Florence. ... ‚ÄîIan Watchorn\\" A less common third type is the squared-off cutaway, used on the Selmer- Maccaferri guitar and some nylon-string guitars. Number Instruments with only a lower cutaway are known as \\"single cutaway\\" instruments, and guitars with both are called \\"double cutaway\\". These terms are sometimes shortened to \\"single cut\\" (such as in the model name for a solid-body electric guitar called the \\"PRS Singlecut\\", produced by the Paul Reed Smith company) or \\"double cut\\". =Double cutaway= As well as the more common lower cutaway, many instruments have an upper cutaway, sometimes smaller than the lower one, or sometimes about the same size. This is mainly seen on electric guitars, as the reduction in body size resulting from a double cutaway would be detrimental to the sound quality of an acoustic guitar. Double cutaways allow the thumb as well as the fingers to move past the neck-body join. In addition, the strap button on double cutaway guitars is typically positioned on the end of the upper horn, further up the neck than on guitars without a cutaway. This improves the instrument's balance when played with a strap. A double cutaway also facilitates left-handed use of right-handed instruments. In some Gibson guitars, models with two cutaways are abbreviated with a \\"DC\\" after the name, such as in the Les Paul Studio DC, the Les Paul Standard DC, the Les Paul Special DC, and the Les Paul Junior DC. Since more single cut versions of these guitars are produced than the doublecut versions, if the model name of these guitars is not followed by \\"DC\\", \\"double cut\\", or \\"double cutaway\\", the assumed reference is to the single cutaway models.
