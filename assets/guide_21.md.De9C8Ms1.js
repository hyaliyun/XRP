In 1783, Louis Ph√©lippeaux met Napoleon Bonaparte at the √âcole Militaire in Paris where the two young men became lifelong enemies. Ph√©lippeaux was also an enemy of the state to France, due to his loyalty to the Ancien R√©gimeSagaWilliamDietrich02-AChavedeRoseta, page 4. and his participation in many anti-revolutionary movements. Previously a French military officer, Ph√©lippeaux immigrated to Great Britain in 1791 during the French Revolution. He served in the Army of Cond√© and fought against the French Republic. Fighting against Napoleon in a battle in Acre, Ph√©lippeaux died from fever in May 1799.  Early life  Louis-Edmond Antoine le Picard de Ph√©lippeaux was born on April 1, 1767 in Angles-sur-l'Anglin, Vienne. His mother was Louise de La Ch√¢tre (1738‚Äì1767), and his father, Louis le Picard de Ph√©lippeaux (1727‚Äì1776), was an officer and a monarchist. At 16 years old, Antoine de Ph√©lippeaux attended the √âcole Militaire in Paris where he met Napoleon Bonaparte, two years his younger. Napoleon never favored Ph√©lippeaux due to jealousy of his superb performance in class. At one point during training, a sergeant major was forced to get between the two quarrelers, but he was kicked in the process. At the √âcole Militaire, the two were taught the same warfare strategies. Both Napoleon and Ph√©lippeaux obtained a commission after examination on September 1, 1785; Ph√©lippeaux listed forty-first and Napoleon listed forty-second. After obtaining his commission of Second Lieutenant, Ph√©lippeaux was sent to the artillery regiment of Besan√ßon.  Enemy of the French Republic  In 1789, Louis-Edmond Antoine le Picard de Ph√©lippeaux was promoted to Captain of the Besan√ßon regiment. Two years later, he resigned and emigrated from France to Great Britain, presumably to escape from the French Revolution, being a monarchist like his father. For four years, he served in the Army of Cond√© against the French Republic. In 1795, he returned to France to help organize a royalist insurrection in Berry. However, Ph√©lippeaux was arrested by general Simon Canuel, and the plan failed. He was imprisoned in Bourges but escaped on the eve of his execution with the help of a relative. Unscathed, he secretly resumed counter-revolutionary activities outside of Paris. Two years later, in 1797, Antoine de Ph√©lippeaux returned to Paris in order to free an English naval officer named Sir William Sidney Smith from Temple prison. At the same time, he planned to rescue three royalists and two people that had aided in his escape. The elaborate plan included the construction of a tunnel from a nearby house to the prison, and involved the help of a mason to chip away at bricks and a seven-year-old girl to serve as a decoy. Nevertheless, the plot failed and Ph√©lippeaux had to reorganize. This time, in order to communicate with the prisoners, he made love to the jailer's daughter. Ph√©lippeaux procured false papers and presented himself at Temple prison as a police commissioner. After presenting a forged order, Smith and the others were released and left quickly by carriage. Notwithstanding, the carriage turned a sharp corner, injuring a child and causing a crowd to gather around the overturned carriage. Despite that, Ph√©lippeaux forced himself and the escapees through the crowd. The authorities were notified of Smith's absence just as Ph√©lippeaux, Williams, and others fled Paris. The group slept in a safe house in the rue de l'Universit√©, and the next morning Ph√©lippeaux led their path to the coast. Once they had arrived in Rouen, they prepared forged passports at a royalist's house. Upon completion, the group dressed in sailor clothes and traveled to Honfleur. Ph√©lippeaux chartered a small fishing boat, and once they were in the British Channel, the group boarded a British ship. On May 7, 1798, they landed in Portsmouth and arrived in London by the next morning. Ph√©lippeaux soon become a hero after Smith told others about his daring rescuer.  Expedition in Egypt  Sir Sidney Smith's influence gained Ph√©lippeaux a British Colonelcy; Smith was now accredited to the Ottoman Empire as an Envoy Plenipotentiary and commanded of a squadron off the coast of Egypt and Syria. In 1799, Ph√©lippeaux accompanied Smith on his diplomatic mission to Constantinople; this led to Acre, where Ph√©lippeaux was presented to Jezzar Pa≈üa. Ph√©lippeaux's new mission was to help Jezzar with the defense of Acre. Ph√©lippeaux inspected the medieval walls and bastions and noticed them crumbling. Acre also had very few cannons facing the sea. He convinced Jezzar of the dangers, and gangs of laborers were placed in Ph√©lippeaux's hands. He began to strengthen the walls, mount guns, construct trenches, and excavate the moat. The trenches he constructed were behind the old fortifications, creating a double barrier. Due to Smith, Ph√©lippeaux was able to garner Napoleon's lighter artillery and install them in the fortress. In April 1799, Ph√©lippeaux successfully directed the defense to defeat Napoleon Bonaparte in the battle of Acre.  Death  While Napoleon was exiled on St. Helena, he recollected that Ph√©lippeaux had a tremendous impact on his life. ‚ÄúWithout him, I would have had taken the Key to the Orient, I would have marched on Constantinople, I would have rebuilt the throne of the Orient.‚Äù Ph√©lippeaux died in 1799, not long after his victory in the battle in Acre, either of exhaustion or the plague. Sir William Sidney Smith wrote of Ph√©lippeaux's death, ‚ÄúCol. Ph√©lippeaux, the engineer, has fallen as a sacrifice for this service; want of rest and exposure to the sun having given him a fever of which he has died.‚Äù  References  1767 births 1799 deaths French counter-revolutionaries French military officers People from Vienne ","title":"Antoine Le Picard de Ph√©lippeaux"},{"id":"46530555","text":"Secretariat of the Interior The Reloj Chino (Chinese clock) Avenida Bucareli, often referred to as \\"Bucareli Street\\", is a main avenue and eje vial (arterial road) in Mexico City.

In August 1962 she successfully saved the fishing vessel Norseman after fighting a fire. For that action she was awarded a Coast Guard Unit Commendation; a first for the Cape class. In addition, three of her crew were awarded individual commendations for their efforts in fighting the fire aboard the Norseman.

He was appointed praetor peregrinus in 144 BC under the consulship of Servius Sulpicius Galba and Lucius Aurelius Cotta. The two major Roman aqueducts, Aqua Appia and Aqua Anio Vetus, were greatly damaged and many fraudulent misappropriations of their water reduced the flow.Frontinus, De aquaeductu, Book I, 7 The Senate commissioned Marcius to repair the channels of two aqueducts and stop the diversion.Pliny the Elder, Natural History, Book XXXVI, XXIV, [17] Additionally, he was given the task to build a bigger aqueduct.

In 143 BC, under the consulship of Appius Claudius Pulcher and Quintus Caecilius Metellus Macedonicus, the Decemvirs consulted the Sibylline Books and found that it was the Aqua Anio Vetus's water that led to the Capitolinus. They reported their conclusions to the Senate. Three years later, in 140 BC, under the consulship of Quintus Servilius Caepio and Gaius Laelius Sapiens, this matter was again brought before the Senate. The decemvirs' opinion prevailed, and the aqueduct's water was rerouted to Capitolinus. Regardless whether the initial change in the aqueduct was the result of ignorance, intention, or chance, the aqueduct was kept in Rome, because it was needed to support the city in its wars against the Italics.Frontinus, De aquaeductu, Book I, 18  See also  * Marcia (gens)  References   Sources  * Frontinus - De aquaeductu * Pliny the Elder - Natural History * Plutarch - Life of Coriolanus * Smith, William - Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology 2nd-century BC Romans Quintus ","title":"Quintus Marcius Rex (praetor 144 BC)"},{"id":"46530834","text":"Madonna of the Rose Bower, c. 1440‚Äì42.

U-3524 was a brand new, high technology electric boat which could run constantly submerged rather than having to surface to recharge her batteries every day the way submarines until that point had had to do.

Early life and family Kirupakaran was born on 17 June 1939 at Point Pedro Hospital in northern Ceylon. His family were from Kaddaively near Karaveddy in the Vadamarachchi region. Orphaned at a young age, he was educated at Methodist Girls' High School, Point Pedro and Hartley College. After being expelled from Hartley College in 1955, he, with the help of his church, obtained an athletics scholarship to study in London. He then joined the London School of Economics (LSE) but was expelled for non- attendance. Karan had falsely claimed that he was expelled from LSE for participating in Vietnam War protests. Europeans found it difficult to pronounce his name so upon obtaining British citizenship Kirupakaran changed his name to Ian Kiru Karan. Karan has married twice and has four children (Navena, Oliver, Jessica and Niclas). He is a Christian. Career Karan joined Schenker & Co. Ltd, London, a shipping and forwarding subsidiary of a German conglomerate Schenker AG, in 1966 as a management trainee. In 1969 he moved to Switzerland, working as a clerk for the container firm Crowe & Co in Basel. He then moved to Hamburg in 1970, working as a dishwasher at a vegetarian restaurant. After three months he joined the Max Gr√ºnhut shipping company as a clerk. He was promoted to departmental manager a year later. He then entered the container business, working as managing director of Lyons Container (Hamburg) and NIC Lease Ltd (Chicago). He went into business on his own in 1975, setting up Container Leasing Agency which served as an agent for his former employer. In 1977 his company, which was now building containers and leasing them, changed its name to CLOU (Container Leasing Company). He sold his company to an Anglo-American competitor in 1993. After observing a three-year non-compete clause, Karan re-entered the container leasing business in 1996, establishing Capital Lease GmbH in Hamburg. The company, whose worldwide operations were based in Hong Kong, became the fastest growing container leasing company in the world and after four years it became the largest leasing company in Europe. The company was reportedly worth US$400 million. Karan was nicknamed \\"container king\\". The highly profit-making company became the seventh largest container company in the world with over 520,000 TEUs. Karan sold Capital Lease to two banks just before the financial crash. Though not a member of any political party, Karan had supported the controversial Party for a Rule of Law Offensive and its leader Ronald Schill, donating 44,500 euros to the party. He then supported the Christian Democratic Union of Germany (CDU), donating it 570,000 euros over several years. After the CDU took control of the Government of Hamburg, Karan was sworn in as Hamburg's Minister of the Economic Affairs and Employment on 25 August 2010. He resigned on 7 March 2011. Karan established the Ian Karan Auditorium in the Bucerius Kunst Forum and an auditorium for medical students at the University of Hamburg. He was chairman of the board of trustees of the Hamburg Theatre Festival and is a member of the supervisory board of Hamburger SV. He was awarded the Federal Cross of Merit in June 2007 for his social and cultural work. Karan was a British citizen for over forty years before taking up German citizenship in December 2009, allegedly on the recommendations of German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Karan later admitted that Merkel never made such a recommendation.

Morrison in particular made no secret of his abhorrence for the \\"half-witted\\" Maze and the nepotism he saw working against more experienced candidates within the service, and at one point noted the lack of promotion for his friend, ornithologist and Customs Deputy Commissioner John La Touche, \\"who, 35 years in China with world wide reputation, is still Deputy Commissioner under a nonentity named Maze who has been 21 years in China, for 10 of which he has been full commissioner. Such is justice!\\". In 1911 Maze was appointed to the senior post of Commissioner in Canton. On 28 March 1914 Maze laid the foundation stone for the new Customs House in Canton and served as commissioner there until 1915, when he was presented with the Order of the Golden Grain, Third Class, which was upgraded to the Second Class in 1919. He was made commissioner in Tientsin (1915‚Äì1920), which was then followed by a posting in Hankow (1921‚Äì1925). In 1920 Emperor Taish≈ç of Japan presented Maze with the Order of the Sacred Treasure, Third Class. In May 1922 he was awarded the Second Class of the Order of the Precious Brilliant Golden Grain by President Xu Shichang. This was upgraded to the Second Class in 1923. In 1924 Maze was awarded the First Class of the Conservancy Medal.In 1925 he was made Commissioner in Shanghai, then one of the most prestigious posts in the service. In 1917 Maze married an Australian, Laura Gwendoline Bullmore (1888‚Äì1972), younger daughter of Edward Bullmore of Oakwood Station and Ipswich, Queensland. The foundation stone of Canton Customs House. When Inspector-General Sir Francis Aglen was dismissed by the Beiyang Government in late 1927, he ensured his deputy A. H. F. Edwardes was made 'Officiating' Inspector-General in his place. Edwardes was set to become the next Inspector- General until but with the rise of the Kuomintang (KMT) to be the predominate political force in China, capturing Shanghai in early 1927, Edwardes position was much less certain and Maze, then Shanghai Commissioner, announced his candidacy for Inspector-General. The KMT distrusted Edwardes, seeing him as too connected to the Beiyang government in Peking, while Maze had had good relations with the KMT and Sun Yat-Sen during his posting in Canton. The KMT, in the process of deposing the internationally recognised Beiyang warlords in Peking, offered Maze the position of 'Inspector-General' in the south three times in 1927, but he refused. Maze was awarded the Second Class of the Order of the Striped Tiger in 1927. In 1928 he accepted an appointment as an adviser to the national board of reconstruction, and in October 1928 Edwardes appointed Maze as Deputy Inspector-General. Inspector-General of Customs Maze in his diplomatic uniform as a delegate to the Coronation of King George VI, May 1937.Feeling a lack of support, particularly from the new KMT government in Nanking from 1928, Edwardes resigned from the Customs Service on 31 December 1928 and Maze was chosen to be the new Inspector-General. Taking up his appointment in Shanghai on 10 January 1929, Maze took his oath to the KMT and bowed to Sun Yat-Sen's portrait in a ceremony that the foreign community of Shanghai described as an \\"Unfortunate precedent\\". As the new Inspector-General Maze moved the headquarters of the Customs Service to Shanghai and Nanking and decreed that no new foreigners would be employed in the service, except where a specific or technical qualification was required. Maze was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in the 1932 New Years Honours. Maze was also made a Commander of the Order of Leopold (Belgium; 12 February 1930), a Commander of the Military Order of Christ (Portugal; 5 March 1932), a Commander of the Order of St. Olav (Norway; 12 July 1933), a Commander First Class of the Order of the Dannebrog (Denmark; 17 June 1935), the German Red Cross Decoration (Germany; 29 July 1937) and a Commander of the L√©gion d'honneur (France; 28 July 1937). Maze was appointed by the Chinese Government as a Counselor to accompany Dr. H. H. Kung as part of the Chinese delegation to the Coronation of King George VI in May 1937. For the coronation Maze commissioned Ede and Ravenscroft to make his Chinese Diplomatic uniform, consisting of a long coat embroidered with corn sheaves in gold with gilt buttons engraved with the letters RC (\\"Republique Chinoise\\") in the centre surrounded by the Chinese motif symbolising five blessings, a black ostrich feather bicorne hat cocked with the colours of the KMT, and a gold and pearl-hilt court sword (On Maze's retirement he donated his uniform to the National Maritime Museum, Greenwich). In February 1938 Maze was awarded the Grand Blue Cordon of the Order of Brilliant Jade by the president Lin Sen \\"In recognition of valuable services rendered by him in the employment of the Chinese Government\\".Lobby ceiling of the Custom House, Shanghai. Like his uncle before him, Maze was an enthusiastic Sinophile, helping to promote many aspects of Chinese culture. Taking a particular interest in Chinese maritime history, when he was Commissioner in Shanghai Maze ensured that many of the interior decorations of the newly built Customs House included maritime elements such as Chinese junks in the lobby ceiling. Maze also assembled a collection of scale models of Chinese junks and sampans, built in Hong Kong and Shanghai under expert supervision. In 1938 he donated this collection to the Science Museum in London. Maze was consistently praised for his impartial work at the Customs Service, but his work was made much more difficult following the Japanese occupation of Shanghai and Nanking by late 1937 as a result of the developing war between China and Japan, Chiang Kai-shek moved his seat of government to Chungking. Maze however, his administration safe within the jurisdiction of the Shanghai International Settlement, elected to remain in Shanghai but later complained that \\"The Chungking government (1,600 miles away) nevertheless continue to expect (at any rate on paper) the Inspector General to execute their mandates and uphold their authority in all the occupied regions, without a vestige of their protection!\\"Sir Frederick Maze to J. H. Cubbon, 23 January 1940, in PPMS2 Sir Frederick Maze Confidential Letters and Reports, Volume 14: 1940, p. 52. Following Japanese entry into the Second World War on 8 December 1941, Maze's decision to remain in Shanghai proved a fateful one when the Japanese occupied the International Settlement that same day. As a result, Maze's duties as Inspector-General of Customs were split between operations within areas controlled by the Chinese government (C. H. B. Joly, OIG) and, until 1945, areas controlled by the Japanese and their puppet government of Wang Jingwei (Kishimoto Hirokichi, OIG 1941‚Äì1945). The Kamakura Maru entering Yokohama harbour in May 1942. A month later it despatched Maze and Lady Maze from Shanghai to Portuguese East Africa. Meanwhile, the Maze's had their house seized by the Japanese, and were forced to live in a small flat for which they had to pay a rental of ¬£14 a month, which came out of the ¬£20 they were allowed to draw from their bank account. By March 1942, in line with increasing Japanese control over the foreign population in Shanghai, Maze was arrested on a charge of espionage. Lady Maze Later recounted that: \\"It was quite a common occurrence to be arrested for espionage. Anyone who wanted 200 dollars (that was the reward for reporting a spy) went to the police and said that so-and-so was acting suspiciously. Of course, the man or woman was immediately arrested.\\" Maze also later recalled to an audience in Montreal in 1954 that: \\"I was put in a felons' den ... Not that I was treated badly [by the Japanese], but it was treating me badly to even think of arresting me. I held high decorations from the Government of Japan. Finally I was released when the Japanese authorities in Tokyo realised this was outrageous treatment for a man who had always treated Japanese commerce with absolute impartiality.\\" Maze was one of approximately 200 Britons and Americans held captive at the infamous 'Bridgehouse' Kempeitai Prison in Shanghai but was later released in May 1942, and he and his wife were repatriated with other members of the Diplomatic Corps (including the British Consul in Shanghai Anthony Hastings George) in June 1942 on board the Kamakura Maru to Louren√ßo Marques, Portuguese East Africa. The Kamakura Maru was a liner of the Nippon Yusen line that the Maze's had travelled on many times before. On arriving in Louren√ßo Marques however Maze acted to return to Chungking to resume office as Inspector-General and in an effort to help his staff still imprisoned there. Returning on 1 March 1943, Joly retired and Maze served until his own retirement on 31 May 1943 when his assistant Lester Knox Little became his successor, being the last foreign head of the customs service in China. Maze then briefly served as an advisor to the Ministry of Finance. Later life On his retirement from the service Maze was awarded by the British government with the Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG). After returning from China Maze lived with his wife in Cape Town, South Africa, except for a trip to Sydney in 1946 to visit Lady Maze's family (Her sister Ursula Mary Bullmore was a fashion editor of The Australian Women's Weekly and married Anthony Hordern of the prominent trading family). In 1948 the Mazes then emigrated to Victoria, British Columbia. On 30 October 1950 Pope Pius XII made Maze a Knight Commander of the Order of Pius IX. The Mazes were founder members of the Victoria branch of the English-Speaking Union in 1955. Maze died at the Royal Jubilee Hospital in Victoria on 25 March 1959 and was buried at Royal Oak burial park on 28 March.

Kenneth Burke is one of the most notable contemporary U.S. rhetoricians who made major contributions to the rhetoric of identification. One of his most foundational ideas is as follows, ‚Äúrhetoric makes human unity possible, that language use is symbolic action, and that rhetoric is symbolic inducement.‚Äù Branching from this, Herrick states that identification in rhetoric is crucial to persuasion, and thus to cooperation, consensus, compromise, and action. Burke believed that the most serious human problem was to be alienated or separated, and rhetoric was to be that problem's only solution. Much of his work was based on bringing people back together. ‚ÄúIdentification is affirmed with earnestness precisely because there is division. Identification is compensatory to division.‚Äù Rhetoric's goal, in regards to identification, is to bring people together of whom have been separated by estrangement or opposition. History Kenneth Burke plays an important part in learning and understanding the core values of rhetorical theory in identification. He introduces the notion by taking the Aristotelian approach into a \\"world of particulars.\\" Burke states that Aristotle treated rhetoric as purely verbal. But there are also areas of overlap. The flexibility of identification that Burke has created expands into elements beyond language. Burke wrote that ‚Äúidentification ranges from the politician who, addressing an audience of farmers, says, ‚ÄòI was a farm boy myself,‚Äô through the mysteries of social status, to the mystic's devout identification with the source of all being.‚Äù This symbolic interaction is possible because it recognizes the hidden sources of identification among human beings as symbol users. From this, Burke understands symbols as something that is around constantly, and that choosing to accept and learning to read them accurately is what needs to be understood. Application Burke‚Äôs theory of identification has been applied and expanded upon in Krista Ratcliffe‚Äôs Rhetorical Listening Framework. Ratcliffe proposes the ‚Äúblurring of Burke‚Äôs and Fuss‚Äôs theories of identification, what becomes visible is multiple places for rhetorical listening. When applying Burke and Fuss‚Äôs theories, Ratcliffe proposes non-identification in cross-cultural communication and feminist pedagogy. Her critique of Western logic is that it is difficult to simultaneously pay attention to both commonalities and differences, but that is where non-identification exists and thus provides a place for rhetorical listening. Burke‚Äôs theory is critiqued by Ratcliffe for only focusing on identification; she argues that rhetorical listeners need to be accountable and take into consideration different points of view, which can be done through simultaneous listening to commonalities and differences. Ratcliffe draws upon Diane Fuss because Fuss expands Burke‚Äôs theory of identification to gear toward examining the differences in identificaion. Fuss defines Identification as related to the issue of connection between opposite entities, such as the interrelation between self and other, subject and object, and insiders and outsiders. For Fuss, identification is difficult to pinpoint, as the distinction between opposite entities is porous, oftentimes ‚Äúimpossibly confused and finally untenable.‚Äù Fuss further builds the connection between identification and disidentification. Fuss defines disidentification as contingent on previous identification with another group, no matter how stereotypical the identification is, while at the same time the identification has receded from the subconscious. Ratcliffe argues that previously identification has been configured as a metaphor, which is manifested in Burke's consubstantiality and Fuss's (dis)identification. Ratcliffe notes that metaphor has been used to function as the dominant trope for identification; however, metaphor foregrounds commonalities more than differences. Ratcliff suggests theorizing identification via the use of metonymy to counter the privilege of communality. Intrinsic to the trope of metonymy is an attention to both commonalities and differences. Practical applications of Burke's ‚Äúidentification‚Äù can be seen in the scholarly effort to reframe identifications. Assembling essays from the fifth Biennial Rhetoric Society of America Conference, Michelle Ballif addresses Ratcliffe's call for rethinking Burke's notion of identification ‚Äúas a place of perpetual reframing that affects who, how, and what can be thought, spoken, written, and imagined.‚Äù While some of the essay contributors draw upon Burke's theory to reinterpret social identifications, others turn to specific social actions to reread Burke's ‚Äúidentification.‚Äù For instance, following Ratcliffe's critique of Burke's theory for its lack of attention to difference, Dominic J. Ashby destabilizes Burke's relatively fixed and teleological construction of identification with ‚Äúa fluid and contingent notion of self‚Äù‚Äîthat is, ‚Äúuchi/soto,\\" or inside/outside in Japanese rhetoric‚Äîhighlighting a simultaneous exclusion and inclusion of outsiders through an ongoing unfolding of group dynamics. By way of analyzing the Facebook news feed of ‚ÄúWe are all Khaled Said,‚Äù Katherine Bridgman expands Burkean identification to ‚Äúembodiment,‚Äù or the mutually coordinated experience between speakers and their audiences triggered by specific circumstances. Along a similar vein, critiquing Burke's consubstantiality for being sexually indifferent, Janice Odom draws from Irigaray's feminist theories to reframe identification as a playground of sexual dominance and surrender.

This group is important because of its relation to Galois theory, √âtale homotopy theory, and the ring of Adeles. In addition, it provides a basic tractable example of a profinite group.  Construction and relations  Concretely the profinite integers will be the set of sequences upsilon such that upsilon(n) in mathbb{Z}/nmathbb{Z} and m   n implies upsilon(m) equiv upsilon(n) bmod m. Pointwise addition and multiplication makes it a commutative ring. If a sequence of integers converges modulo n for every n then the limit will exist as a profinite integer. There is an embedding of the integers into the ring of profinite integers since there is the canonical injection :mathbb{Z} hookrightarrow widehat{mathbb{Z}} where n mapsto (n bmod 1, n bmod 2, dots).  Topological properties  The set of profinite integers has an induced topology in which it is a compact Hausdorff space, coming from the fact that it can be seen as a closed subset of the infinite product > hat{mathbb{Z}} subset prod_n mathbb{Z}/nmathbb{Z} which is compact with its product topology by Tychonoff's theorem. Note the topology on each finite group mathbb{Z}/nmathbb{Z} is given as the discrete topology. Since addition of profinite integers is continuous, widehat{mathbb{Z}} is a compact Hausdorff abelian group, and thus its Pontryagin dual must be a discrete abelian group. In fact the Pontryagin dual of widehat{mathbb{Z}} is the discrete abelian group mathbb{Q}/mathbb{Z}. This fact is exhibited by the pairing > mathbb{Q}/mathbb{Z} times widehat{mathbb{Z}} to U(1), , (q, a) > mapsto chi(qa) where chi is the character of mathbf{A}_{mathbb{Q}, f} induced by mathbb{Q}/mathbb{Z} to U(1), , alpha mapsto e^{2pi ialpha}.K. Conrad, The character group of Q  Relation with adeles  The tensor product widehat{mathbb{Z}} otimes_{mathbb{Z}} mathbb{Q} is the ring of finite adeles > mathbf{A}_{mathbb{Q}, f} = prod_p{}^{'} mathbb{Q}_p of mathbb{Q} where the symbol ' means restricted productQuestions on some maps involving rings of finite adeles and their unit groups.. There is an isomorphism > mathbf{A}_mathbb{Q} cong > mathbb{R}times(hat{mathbb{Z}}otimes_mathbb{Z}mathbb{Q})  Applications in Galois theory and Etale homotopy theory  For the algebraic closure overline{mathbf{F}}_q of a finite field mathbf{F}_q of order q, the Galois group can be computed explicitly. From the fact text{Gal}(mathbf{F}_{q^n}/mathbf{F}_q) cong mathbb{Z}/nmathbb{Z} where the automorphisms are given by the Frobenius endomorphism, the Galois group of the algebraic closure of mathbf{F}_q is given by the inverse limit of the groups mathbb{Z}/nmathbb{Z}, so its Galois group is isomorphic to the group of profinite integers > operatorname{Gal}(overline{mathbf{F}}_q/mathbf{F}_q) cong > widehat{mathbb{Z}} which gives a computation of the absolute Galois group of a finite field. = Relation with Etale fundamental groups of algebraic tori = This construction can be re-interpreted in many ways. One of them is from Etale homotopy theory which defines the Etale fundamental group pi_1^{et}(X) as the profinite completion of automorphisms > pi_1^{et}(X) = lim_{i in I} text{Aut}(X_i/X) where X_i to X is an Etale cover. Then, the profinite integers are isomorphic to the group > pi_1^{et}(text{Spec}(mathbf{F}_q)) cong hat{mathbb{Z}} from the earlier computation of the profinite Galois group. In addition, there is an embedding of the profinite integers inside the Etale fundamental group of the algebraic torus > hat{mathbb{Z}} hookrightarrow pi_1^{et}(mathbb{G}_m) since the covering maps come from the polynomial maps > (cdot)^n:mathbb{G}_m to mathbb{G}_m from the map of commutative rings > f:mathbb{Z}[x,x^{-1}] to mathbb{Z}[x,x^{-1}] sending x mapsto x^n since mathbb{G}_m = text{Spec}(mathbb{Z}[x,x^{-1}]). If the algebraic torus is considered over a field k, then the Etale fundamental group pi_1^{et}(mathbb{G}_m/text{Spec(k)}) contains an action of text{Gal}(overline{k}/k) as well from the fundamental exact sequence in etale homotopy theory.  Class field theory and the profinite integers  Class field theory is a branch of algebraic number theory studying the abelian field extensions of a field. Given the global field mathbb{Q}, the abelianization of its absolute Galois group > text{Gal}(overline{mathbb{Q}}/mathbb{Q})^{ab} is intimately related to the associated ring of adeles mathbb{A}_mathbb{Q} and the group of profinite integers. In particular, there is a map, called the Artin map > Psi_mathbb{Q}:mathbb{A}_mathbb{Q}^times / mathbb{Q}^times to > text{Gal}(overline{mathbb{Q}}/mathbb{Q})^{ab} which is an isomorphism. This quotient can be determined explicitly as > begin{align} mathbb{A}_mathbb{Q}^times/mathbb{Q}^times &cong > (mathbb{R}times hat{mathbb{Z}})/mathbb{Z}  &= > underset{leftarrow}{lim} mathbb({mathbb{R}}/mmathbb{Z})  &= > underset{x mapsto x^m}{lim} S^1  &= hat{mathbb{Z}} end{align} giving the desired relation. There is an analogous statement for local class field theory since every finite abelian extension of K/mathbb{Q}_p is induced from a finite field extension mathbb{F}_{p^n}/mathbb{F}_p.

Fiorina was formerly chief executive officer of the technology company Hewlett-Packard, and was the Republican nominee for U.S. Senate in California in 2010. Fiorina suspended her campaign for the Republican presidential nomination on February 10, 2016. On April 27, 2016, Ted Cruz announced that Fiorina would be his running mate should he win the nomination. She joined his campaign days before the Indiana Primary, which he lost. Cruz suspended his campaign that evening, effectively ending Fiorina's vice-presidential bid. After the election, however, Fiorina received one electoral vote for vice president from a faithless elector from Texas; the other 37, as pledged, voted for Mike Pence. Background Carly Fiorina speaking at the 2014 Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in National Harbor, Maryland, March 2014. A candidate for the United States Senate in 2010, Fiorina ruled out running for the U.S. Senate in 2016, but did not rule out running for President in 2016. In November 2014, The Washington Post reported that Fiorina was \\"actively exploring\\" a run for president. Her business background and status as the only CEO and the only woman in a \\"sea of suited men\\" were mentioned as positives, with Republican strategists pointing to her unsuccessful 2010 Senate campaign, unpaid campaign debt and dismissal from HP as \\"considerable challenges.\\" On March 29, 2015, Fiorina told Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace there was a \\"higher than 90 percent\\" chance that she would enter the race to be the Republican Party nominee in the 2016 presidential election. Campaign  Announcement and media blitz  In the weeks leading up to her campaign announcement, Fiorina made numerous strategic appearances in the key battleground states of Iowa and New Hampshire. Fiorina announced her candidacy on May 4, 2015, via an online video posted by her campaign, followed by appearances on ABC's Good Morning America and The Kelly File. On May 5, Fiorina made publicized appearances on Today and Late Night with Seth Meyers. After days of national media appearances described as a \\"media blitz,\\" Fiorina returned to campaign in Iowa on May 7.  Controversy over tenure at Lucent and Hewlett-Packard  Shortly after Fiorina announced her entry into the 2016 presidential race, and in a replay of her 2010 senatorial race, social media and editorial outlets referenced her tenure as HP's CEO and chair as a basis for her run for president. Commentators challenged Fiorina's claims of success, citing dozens of examples and anecdotes of why Fiorina had allegedly failed in her business leadership roles at both Hewlett-Packard and Lucent. The discussion revolved around the 30,000 U.S. job cuts as well as offshoring, which Fiorina directed during her tenure at HP, contrasting it with the high compensation bonuses she received from the company, and the events surrounding her resignation from HP. Campaign manager Sarah Isgur Flores deflected the criticism saying, Fiorina \\"worked hard to save as many jobs as possible\\", and her defenders argued that Fiorina made difficult and unpopular decisions to turn around a struggling firm. Other discussions focused on her well-documented public record, including coverage of risky vendor financing programs that Fiorina was said to have supported during her time as Lucent's president of consumer products. The programs, which allegedly inflated the company's revenue figures to the benefit of Fiorina's bonus payout, were said to have contributed to the downfall of the company, formerly part of the iconic AT&T; Bell Labs organization. On the afternoon of May 4, 2015, a website appeared under the domain name CarlyFiorina.org stating that Fiorina's organization had failed to register the domain and criticizing her tenure as CEO.\\"CarlyFiorina.org\\", Retrieved May 6, 2015. According to The Hill, the site was created by an employee of the Service Employees International Union, a labor union representing over 1.9 million US service industry employees. On May 10, Fiorina appeared on Meet the Press; responding to host Chuck Todd's question asking if Fiorina has \\"regrets about those layoffs [that occurred while she was CEO of HP]\\", Fiorina said that they doubled the size of the company, grew it from 2% to 9%, tripled the rate of innovation to 11 patents a day, and grew jobs in the U.S. and abroad. She added \\"I had to make tough calls during tough times. Tough times that many technology companies didn't survive at all. Andrew Sorkin, from The New York Times, challenged Fiorina's assertions about her success as a businesswoman, writing that these percentages refer to revenue and not profit, and that the revenue growth was a result of acquisitions. In August 2015, and in what was reported as a rebuttal to Sorkin's article, Tom Perkins, who was one of the HP board members who voted to oust Fiorina, published a full-page ad in the form of a letter in The New York Times, paid for by a pro-Fiorina super PAC \\"CARLY for America\\", in which he commented on the firing from HP by saying: \\"Critics often claim Carly was fired at HP because she was unsuccessful. As a member of the board, I can tell you this is not true. In truth, it was the Board I was a part of that was ineffective and dysfunctional.\\" In mid-September 2015, Fiorina addressed previous criticism from Yale business management scholar Jeffrey Sonnenfeld who had said in 2008 that Fiorina used a \\"street bully\\" style of management, and that she had been a failure as HP's CEO. He also described in August 2015 how Fiorina was saying she had doubled revenue at HP, but Sonnenfeld said this was an empty metric; the real gauge was that HP had lost 52% of its value during her tenure. Donald Trump, a Republican contender against Fiorina in the 2016 presidential race, used Sonnenfeld's analysis against her during the second televised debate in 2015, and she countered by calling Sonnenfeld a \\"Clintonite\\". Sonnenfeld wrote back in Politico magazine that problems with Fiorina's leadership style were what caused HP to lose half its value during her tenure. He said she does not admit mistakes and thus does not learn from them, that she manipulates statistics, that she makes poor executive decisions, and that she turns to ad hominem attacks when others oppose her plans. Sonnenfeld responded that four of the 2016 Republican presidential candidates had requested and received his advice, and that he had never been a \\"Clintonite\\". Meg Whitman, the current CEO of Hewlett Packard, who endorsed Governor Chris Christie during the primaries, stated that in her opinion while Fiorina was a good CEO, she was not qualified to be President of the United States, stating that a business background is important but that having worked in government is also important, and that \\"it's very difficult for your first role in politics to be President of the United States\\".  June‚ÄìJuly campaigning  The candidate meeting with supporters at a coffee reception and fundraising event in Paradise Valley, Arizona. Fiorina's presidential campaign had provoked both praise and criticism. The National Review pointed out her foil to Hillary Clinton (also a female presidential candidate), saying \\"Carly Fiorina is no doubt getting attention because of her unique background, but more and more people are staying to listen because she has something fresh to say\\", and that \\"Fiorina also seems to relish the role of being the most pointed critic of Hillary Clinton‚Ä¶. She contrasts her background as a 'problem solver' with Clinton's record as a professional politician.\\" The Nation commented, \\"With so-called women's issues poised to play an unprecedented role in the upcoming election, Republicans need someone who can troll Hillary Clinton without seeming sexist.\\" Steve Deace of the Conservative Review noted that she was named \\"the most powerful woman in business\\" by Fortune in 1998, saying \\"Fiorina is a cross between Carson and Trump. She has some of Carson's inspirational biography, and some of Trump's business acumen/resume.\\" On July 6, the Fiorina campaign announced that it had raised $1.4 million in donations and the CARLY for America super PAC reported raising $3.4 million. On July 16, Fiorina starred in a Buzzfeed video about sexism in the workplace. Fiorina became the second presidential hopeful to shoot a video with Buzzfeed, after Ted Cruz. The video generated praise for being bold and funny, as well as criticism that the video was divisive, pandering, and overtly liberal.  Performance in the first GOP debate  On August 6, Fiorina participated in Fox News's first GOP debate. Failing to qualify for one of the Fox News prime-time debate slots, she was relegated to the debate airing earlier the same day. Fiorina's performance led news sources to conclude she had won the early debate. Following the debate, pundits correctly predicted that her polling numbers would surge. On August 9, Fiorina reported an uptick in fundraising support. In an online poll by NBC and SurveyMonkey on August 10, Fiorina came in fourth of the seventeen Republican contenders with 8% of Republican primary voters saying they would support her in a primary or a caucus. This reflects a gain in support of six points from previous polling data. An article on the Wall Street Journal in the aftermath of the debate, noted Fiorina's surge and described the challenge she will face in translating the post-debate bounce into a viable campaign for the nomination, citing the 1.7 million she raised during her first two months of her campaign (3.4 from her super PAC), which is far less than other candidates, and her difficult tenure at HP. Second GOP debate On every national poll that was released after the first debate held on August 6, 2015, all showed Fiorina to be firmly within the top ten of Republican candidates. However, because CNN chose to include all national polls after July 10, 2015 (multiple weeks before the debate), and before September 10; before the September 16 debate, Fiorina consistently polled under 2%; and because a significantly larger number of polls was released before the debate Fiorina was projected to not make the later of the debates, which follow the same top ten formula as the first FOX debate to decide which candidate goes into which debate. Fiorina publicly requested that Republican National Committee, or RNC, force CNN to change their standards, and her Deputy Campaign Manager, Sarah Isgur Flores, wrote an article on the website Medium expressing annoyance with CNN's standards. On September 3, 2015, CNN decided to amend the criteria stating any candidate who ranks in the top 10 in polling between August 7 and September 10 would be included. Fiorina's appearance on September 16, 2015, in the second debate at the Reagan Presidential Library was generally seen by the press as improving her standing in the Republican field. The New York Times described her performance as: \\"steely, self-assured and at times deeply personal\\", and as one which may \\"help correct a problem that her party has struggled with in recent elections: how to appeal more effectively to women\\".Jeremy W. Peters ‚Äì \\"Carly Fiorina Gains Traction in Debate, Helping G.O.P. Reach Out to Women\\", The New York Times, September 17, 2015.

As a result of low polling numbers, Fiorina was left out of the ABC News debate on February 6, 2016, despite mounting a protest that included her, two fellow GOP presidential candidates (Sen. Ted Cruz and Dr. Ben Carson), and other high- profile GOP leaders such as Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich to be included in the debate. On February 10, 2016, Fiorina suspended her presidential campaign due to weak results in Iowa and New Hampshire. She received two percent of the votes in the Iowa caucuses and four percent of the votes in the New Hampshire primary. On March 9, she formally endorsed Ted Cruz for president.Flegenheimer, Matt.

She has expressed support for legislation to ban abortions 20 weeks after fertilization, with an exception for cases of rape, incest, or danger to the life of the mother. Fiorina supports overturning Roe v. Wade, the 1973 ruling by the Supreme Court which legalized abortion in the United States, and leaving it for the states to decide. Fiorina opposed criminalizing abortion and said she would not apply a litmus test when considering judges. The National Right to Life Committee, the Susan B. Anthony List and the California ProLife Council all endorsed Fiorina's 2010 U.S. Senate campaign in California. Fiorina supports eliminating federal funding for Planned Parenthood, the largest single provider of abortions in the United States, performing over 300,000 per year.Sarah McCammon, Feeling Momentum, Carly Fiorina Visits The Iowa State Fair, NPR (August 18, 2015). The use of federal funds for abortions is mostly banned under current law. During the September 16, 2015, GOP presidential candidates' debate on CNN, Fiorina criticized Planned Parenthood for their involvement in abortions. She referred to the secret recordings made by The Center for Medical Progress (CMP), and stated: : \\"As regards Planned Parenthood, anyone who has watched this videotape, I dare Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama to watch these tapes. Watch a fully formed fetus on the table, its heart beating, its legs kicking, while someone says we have to keep it alive to harvest its brain. This is about the character of our nation, and if we will not stand up and force President Obama to veto this bill, shame on us.\\" According to The Wall Street Journal, \\"there was never any video that depicted, as Ms. Fiorina stated, a live fetus on a table being prepared for organ harvesting.\\" PolitiFact.com noted that the video contains stock footage of a fetus added for dramatic effect, Fiorina's claim made it sound as if there is actual footage of Planned Parenthood examining an aborted fetus whose heart is still beating, which there wasn't. The New York Times reported that \\"while the authenticity of the videos remains a subject of debate, Mrs. Fiorina appears to have exaggerated their contents,\\" and PolitiFact said \\"Fiorina makes it sound as if the footage shows what Planned Parenthood is alleged to have done. In fact, the stock footage was added to the video to dramatize its content. We rate her statement Mostly False.\\" As PolitiFact.com pointed out, Fiorina is likely talking about a video showing an interview with a woman talking about a scene similar to the one Fiorina describes; the video's creators have supplemented her interview with grisly stock footage of a fetus outside the womb.\\" Climate change In a February 2015 speech, Fiorina acknowledged the scientific consensus that climate change is real and caused by human activity, but remained doubtful that government can affect the issue and has \\"implied that targeting the coal industry will not solve the problem\\". On April 4, 2015, Fiorina spoke out about climate change in her home state of California as well as how the state has fared in the 2012‚Äì15 North American drought, stating that \\"liberal environmentalists\\" have brought what she described as a \\"tragedy\\" and that California is an example of \\"liberals being willing to sacrifice other people's lives and livelihoods at the altar of their ideology\\". Drugs Fiorina said in May 2015 that \\"drug addiction shouldn't be criminalized\\" and cited \\"decriminalizing drug addiction and drug use\\" as an example of a successful reform. Fiorina opposes legalization of marijuana, but says that she believes in states' rights and that as president she will not enforce the federal ban on marijuana in Colorado, where voters have legalized marijuana as a matter of state law.Jesse Rifkin, Carly Fiorina Wouldn't Enforce Federal Marijuana Ban In States With Legalization, Huffington Post (May 8, 2015). Economy Fiorina opposed the 2009 federal stimulus act, calling it a waste of taxpayer money. Fiorina has said she would cut the pay of federal workers and base their compensation on performance.

In a 2010 debate, she said, \\"I've also been very clear in saying if embryos were going to be destroyed in any event, that I have no trouble with research.\\" Foreign and military policy Fiorina has criticized the Iran nuclear agreement, based on a number of issues that she called \\"suspicious\\". She has said that Iran is not a good actor and did not negotiate in good faith, and that if the U.S. wanted to achieve a good deal then the negotiators on the U.S.'s behalf should have walked away from the bargaining table but never did. Fiorina also stated that the U.S. cannot trust the verification components of the deal because Iran does not allow access to military sites and Iran has broken sanctions and inspection agreements in the past, and that the approval of the international community is suspect because Russia and China were negotiating on Iran's behalf looking out for their own self-interests (specifically gaining access to Iran's economy) and the European Union negotiates weak deals.Fiorina: Iran is 'at the heart' of evil in Middle East, The Washington Post (video of the August 7, 2015 Republican presidential debate).Carly Fiorina, Opinion: A false choice and a flawed deal, Fox News (April 2, 2015).

Fiorina said that: \\"It would be different if Iran was a good actor and had negotiated in good faith all this time but they haven't\\" and said \\"If you want a good deal, you've got to walk away sometimes. We never did.\\" Fiorina also suggested that verification provisions in the agreement were insufficient and that approval of the agreement by the international community and the U.S.'s negotiating partners was suspect because Russia and China have an interest in gaining access to Iran's economy and the European Union \\"has negotiated, frankly, a number of weak deals.\\" Fiorina expressed for a military building, calling specifically for an additional \\"50 Army brigades, 36 Marine battalions, between 300 and 350 naval ships, and an upgrade of 'every leg of the nuclear triad.'\\"Kate Brannen, Carly Fiorina's Military Would Cost an Extra $500 Billion (And That's Before the New Nukes), Daily Beast (September 17, 2015).

At a forum at The Citadel in September 2015, Fiorina said that if president she would cancel a scheduled state dinner during a visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping and instead would confront the leader on Chinese hacking: \\"I'd have a long conversation in the Oval Office to say, 'Understand, there will be consequences. We will retaliate. We consider this an act of aggression.'\\"David Catanese, Carly Fiorina Would Cancel the State Dinner With China, U.S. News & World Report (September 22, 2015).

And I also believe that waterboarding was used when there was no other way to get information that was necessary.\\" Health care Fiorina has stated that the Affordable Care Act is a vast legislative overreach that did not fix the problem it started out to fix and created problems for everyone else. Among her criticisms of the Affordable Care Act is that the number of uninsured is not coming down fast enough, deductibles have gone up, and the amount of paperwork has increased. She supports repeal.

Fiorina defended the right of school districts to require that children be vaccinated against common communicable diseases, but said that districts should not be permitted to require that children receive \\"some of these more esoteric immunizations\\" in order to attend public schools. Immigration In California, Fiorina supported the DREAM Act, which would allow children brought to the U.S. by their parents when they were under the age of 16 to secure permanent U.S. residency and a path to citizenship if they graduate from college or serve in the armed forces.David Knowles, Carly Fiorina: No Path to Citizenship for those Who Came to U.S. Illegally, Bloomberg (May 4, 2015).

Fiorina has stressed the need to improve border security before undertaking comprehensive immigration reform. LGBT issues In November 2009, in an interview by The Wall Street Journal, Fiorina said that she voted in favor of Proposition 8, a California ballot proposition which banned same-sex marriage in that state, but noted that \\"she created a strong program of domestic partner benefits while at HP\\".John Fund, She Wants to Reboot California, The Wall Street Journal (November 28, 2009).

In 2010, while answering a Christian Coalition questionnaire, Fiorina said that she supported a federal constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage.Amanda Terkel, Carly Fiorina Changes Mind On Amending Constitution To Bar Same-Sex Marriage, Huffington Post (May 5, 2015). During an interview with the conservative Christian website Caffeinated Thoughts at a Dallas County, Iowa Republican event in May 2015, Fiorina reversed her previous position, saying that she now opposed such a measure: \\"I think the Supreme Court ruling will become the law of the land, and however much I may agree or disagree with it, I wouldn't support an amendment to reverse it.\\" She further stated that \\"government shouldn't discriminate on how it provides benefits and ... people have a right to their religious views and those views need to be protected.\\" In August 2010, Fiorina indicated on a Christian Coalition questionnaire that she opposed enforcing the 1993 law banning homosexuals in the military.

On September 19, 2010, in a Faith2Action survey, she opposed the Employment Non-Discrimination Act. On March 17, 2013, on ABC News, Fiorina said \\"I think we have to be careful, because John Boehner's views, which are different from Rob Portman's views, are equally sincere. And I think when we get into trouble on this debate when we assume that people who support gay marriage are open and compassionate and people who don't are not. It's why I believe the right way to solve these very personal issues is to let people vote on them, don't have judges decide it, don't even have representative government decide it, let people vote on it in the states. I think people of both points of view, accept the democratic process. What they don't always accept is a bunch of self-important, self-appointed judges saying this is culturally the new norm.\\" In April 2015, Fiorina defended the Indiana's Religious Freedom Restoration Act and government benefits to same- sex couples. She stated that the Indiana bill is about the \\"opportunity to practice their religions freely\\" and \\"It has not and has never been a license to discriminate.\\" On April 2, 2015, in an interview with USA Today, she described it as \\"shameful\\" how, in her view, liberals have fanned the furor over the Indiana law. \\"I honestly believe this is a set of liberal political activists who practice a game of identity politics and divisive politics to whip people into a frenzy, and I think it's very destructive to the fabric of this country,\\" she said. She blasted business leaders in Silicon Valley and elsewhere who have criticized the Indiana law as discriminatory, questioning why there isn't similar outrage \\"in the Twitterverse about the subjugation of the rights of women and gays in many countries in which these companies do business. Where is the outrage about that? Where is the outrage about how gays are treated in Iran, for example? Where is the outrage about how women are treated in Algeria?\\" During an April 2015 interview with ABC News, Fiorina stated, \\"I think it's really too bad, honestly, that CEOs are being pressured [...] What this law basically says is that a person can push back against ... either federal government mandate or state government mandate to exert their religious liberties. She also reaffirmed her support for civil unions. In June 2015, as a response to the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Obergefell v. Hodges, which held that there is a fundamental right to same-sex marriage under the Fourteenth Amendment, Fiorina said the decision was \\"only the latest example of an activist Court. I do not agree that the Court can or should redefine marriage. I believe that responsibility should have remained with states and voters where this conversation has continued in churches, town halls and living rooms around the country.\\" In May 2015, however, she said that she hoped that the nation could support the Supreme Court's decision to legalize same-sex marriage and, at the same time, respect individual consciences. In 2017, Fiorina headlined the 40th anniversary gathering of Log Cabin Republicans, an LGBT Republican organization which supports same-sex marriage and other LGBT rights.  Maternity leave  Fiorina opposes federal legislation to require companies to provide paid maternity leave to their employees. Fiorina has said that the private sector should make these decisions, pointing out that HP, while she was CEO, offered paid maternity leave voluntarily, and that companies such as Netflix have done the same. Minimum wage Fiorina opposes a federal minimum wage increase, adding that she believes it \\"is a classic example of a policy that is best carried out in the states\\", saying a national minimum wage does not make sense because economic conditions in New Hampshire vary significantly from more expensive economic conditions in Los Angeles or New York. She also believes that raising the federal minimum wage would \\"hurt those who are looking for entry-level jobs.\\" Net neutrality Fiorina opposes net neutrality rules adopted by the Federal Communications Commission and has said she would \\"roll back\\" that policy, because \\"Regulation over innovation is a really bad role for government.\\"Charlotte Alter, Carly Fiorina Says She Would 'Roll Back' Net Neutrality Rules, Time (May 5, 2015).Carly Fiorina, Op-ed: Obama's net neutrality failure, CNN (April 7, 2015). Regulation Fiorina \\"generally believes that reducing government regulations helps to spur the economy.\\" Fiorina has condemned the Dodd‚ÄìFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, saying in April 2015 that \\"We should get rid of Dodd-Frank and start again.\\"Kevin Cirilli, Fiorina: Abolish Wall Street reform law, The Hill (April 9, 2015). Fiorina has stated that not \\"a single regulation has ever been repealed.\\"Glenn Kessler, Fact Checker: Carly Fiorina's claim that not 'a single regulation' has ever been repealed, The Washington Post (April 27, 2015). Glenn Kessler of The Washington Post \\"Fact Checker\\" column gave this statement three out of four Pinocchios, finding that \\"Important parts of the economy have been deregulated in recent decades. While the repeal of a specific rule is relatively rare, there are certainly examples.\\" Susan E. Dudley, director of the Regulatory Studies Center at George Washington University, said that Fiorina is \\"generally right that regulations, once issued, are rarely revisited and even more rarely actually repealed\\". Taxation During her 2010 Senate campaign, Fiorina \\"called for eliminating the estate tax and capital gains taxes for investments in small businesses, and lowering marginal tax rates.\\" Fiorina opposes proposals to increase the federal gas tax or state gas taxes in order to fund the Highway Trust Fund, asserting in a February 2015 op-ed in The Wall Street Journal that \\"Any gas tax hike, big or small, will harm American families and hurt economic growth.\\"Carly Fiorina & Penny Nance, Op-ed: Cheaper Gas? Politicians Want a Tax Fill-Up, The Wall Street Journal (February 11, 2015).  Technology employees  Fiorina favors expanding the H-1B visa program. Writing in opposition to proposals she considered protectionist in a 2004 op-ed in The Wall Street Journal, Fiorina said that while \\"America is the most innovative country,\\" it would not remain so if the country were to \\"run away from the reality of the global economy.\\" Fiorina said to Congress in 2004: \\"There is no job that is America's God-given right anymore. We have to compete for jobs as a nation.\\" While Fiorina argued that the only way to \\"protect U.S. high-tech jobs over the long haul was to become more competitive [in the United States],\\" her comments prompted \\"strong reactions\\" from some technology workers, who argued that lower wages outside the United States encouraged the offshoring of American jobs.

He joined the French Royal Army as a volunteer in 1771 and was a captain by 1787. He was elected commander of a volunteer battalion in 1792 and served in the War of the Pyrenees. Shortly after being promoted commander of a light infantry regiment Willot was appointed general of brigade in June 1793. A few months later he was denounced as a Royalist and jailed. In the light of later events, this may have been an accurate assessment of Willot's sentiments. After release from prison in January 1795, he led troops in Spain during the summer campaign. He was promoted to general of division in July 1795. Willot transferred to the War in the Vend√©e where he served until spring 1796. During this period he was temporarily in command of the Army of the West. He was in charge of the 8th Military Division at Marseilles until his election to the Council of Five Hundred in April 1797. He aligned himself with the Royalists who were regarded as a threat by powerful men in the French Directory. After the Coup of 18 Fructidor he was deported to French Guiana with others belonging to Pichegru's faction, but later escaped. Willot overtly embraced the Royalist cause and worked with France's enemies to overthrow the First French Republic. After drifting to several nations, he spent the years of the First French Empire in the United States. Returning to France with King Louis XVIII he was ennobled as a count and given awards for his loyalty. His surname is one of the names inscribed under the Arc de Triomphe, on Column 34. Early career Willot was born in Belfort, France on 31 August 1755. He joined the army as a volunteer in the provincial Mantes Regiment in 1771 and by 1787 he had become a captain of grenadiers. His regiment was disbanded in March 1791 and he soon was appointed commander of the National Guard of Saint-Germain-en- Laye. In June 1791 he became aide-de-camp to Lieutenant General Claude Gabriel de Choisy. On 23 March 1792 he was elected lieutenant colonel of the 5th Chasseurs Cantabres Battalion. Willot was put in charge of 500 regulars and 1,000 volunteers and sent to block a Spanish thrust in the eastern Pyrenees at C√©ret. On 20 April 1793, the Spanish column defeated the French, capturing the bridge over the Tech River and capturing four cannons. This occurred in the Army of the Eastern Pyrenees sector. A 1793 order of battle listed the 5th Light Infantry Battalion in the Army of the Western Pyrenees. The 5th Chasseurs Cantabres became the 5th Light Infantry Battalion in 1791 and was expanded into the 5th Light Infantry Demi-brigade during the 1793 amalgame. General officer On 1 June 1793, Joseph Marie Servan de Gerbey promoted Willot to chef de brigade (colonel) of the enlarged 5th Light. The unit was engaged in an action at Chateau-Pignon on 6 June and stormed the Montaigne Louis XIV redoubt on 22 June. These battles occurred in the Army of the Western Pyrenees sector. On 23 June, the representatives on mission elevated Willot to the rank of general of brigade and assigned him to lead the army advance guard. However, on 4 October 1793 he was removed from command as a suspected Royalist and incarcerated at Bayonne. The army commander √âtienne Deprez-Crassier was dismissed on the same day and arrested four days later. Joseph Marie Servan Willot finally emerged from prison in January 1795. He regained his rank as general of brigade on 13 April. He became the acting commander of the 1st Division of the Army of the Western Pyrenees in place of Jean-Antoine Marbot. On 6 July 1795 he was promoted general of division. On 13 July, the army commander Bon-Adrien Jeannot de Moncey sent Willot and 3,500 troops from Salvatierra toward Vitoria while another 4,500-man column under Bernard Dessein reached Vitoria from the north. The Spanish troops managed to slip out of the trap but they were forced to abandon their supplies. Dessein and Willot then joined forces and occupied Bilbao. When the news of the Treaty of Basel arrived on 5 August 1795, the French occupied Miranda de Ebro. The French troops started back to Bayonne on 17 August. Two divisions numbering 10,995 soldiers were assembled under Willot and Dessein and ordered to march to join Lazare Hoche's Army of the West. By the time the reinforcement reached its destination at Fontenay-le-Comte, heavy desertion reduced its numbers to 4,000 men. The reinforcement missed the Battle of Quiberon on 21 July 1795 where Hoche smashed the Royalists. Historian Ramsay Weston Phipps stated that Willot became \\"a thorn in Hoche's side\\", without giving an explanation. Yet when Hoche was called to Paris on 17 December, Willot assumed the acting command of the Army of the West. He held the interim leadership role from 18 December until 6 January 1796. Later, Willot was given command of the South Division rather than the more senior Emmanuel Grouchy who was miffed at being passed over. By March 1796 the War in the Vend√©e was practically won and Hoche turned his attention to the Chouannerie which was suppressed by May. Though they lost the war, the rebels gained some rights. This outcome was denounced by some in Paris who blamed Hoche; the same people praised Willot. On 13 April 1796, Willot transferred to the Army of Rhin-et-Moselle. He took command of the 8th Military Division on 25 July the same year. This was in Marseilles where he claimed to be impartial but managed to offend the Jacobin party. Napoleon Bonaparte was influential in getting him removed. At this time he joined the Royalist faction. Evidently, his political leanings were well known because Pierre Augereau blustered that Willot in Marseilles had nearly sabotaged the Battle of Arcole campaign by failing to reinforce the Army of Italy. Willot was elected to the Council of Five Hundred on 11 April 1797. He was elected for the Bouches-du-Rh√¥ne by 102 out of 203 votes. He became the Council's Secretary and later Inspector. Exile and return Willot is name 15 on Column 34. The French Directory was an increasingly unpopular government and the Council of Five Hundred and the Council of Ancients had no legal means to restrain the Directory. The Directors Paul Fran√ßois Jean Nicolas, vicomte de Barras, Jean-Fran√ßois Rewbell and Louis Marie de La R√©velli√®re-L√©peaux were known as the Triumvirate and held the most power. The other two directors, Lazare Carnot and Fran√ßois-Marie, marquis de Barth√©lemy as well as a swelling majority of the Five Hundred and the Ancients were in the opposition which wanted a change in government and a stop to the endless wars. The opposition included both Republicans who wanted better government and avowed Royalists such as Jean-Charles Pichegru and Willot. Unfortunately for the opposition the two factions were not able to coordinate their efforts. Foolishly, the Royalists refused to assure the Republican members of the opposition that they would not be punished if the House of Bourbon returned. Meanwhile, the Triumvirate was alarmed by the growing strength of their enemies. Another blunder made by the opposition was making an enemy of Bonaparte at a time when he was a national hero for his victories in Italy. Despite being warned by members of the opposition Club de Clichy, the outspoken Jacques-Victor Dumolard offended Bonaparte in a speech made to the Five Hundred. After thinking about sending troops from his army to overthrow the opposition in Paris, Bonaparte decided against it. On 3 June 1797, Bonaparte sent the Directory proof that Pichegru was in treasonous contact with France's enemies. Though Bonaparte proved coy, Hoche, the commander of the Army of Sambre-et- Meuse was eager to intervene on behalf of the Triumvirate. On 9 July 1797, Hoche sent 9,000 troops under Louis Lemoine marching toward Paris. The attempted coup collapsed and the troops withdrew when it was discovered that Hoche was too young to assume the position of Minister of War. Though it was obvious what was going on, the divided opposition was unable to implement effective countermeasures. Barras and his confederates resolved to try again and Bonaparte sent Augereau to help execute the coup. Jean-Charles Pichegru During this period Pichegru was strangely inert. Because of his stature, he prevented more active men like Willot from carrying out plans to defend against the Triumvirate. The Coup of 18 Fructidor occurred on 4 September 1797 as soldiers under Augereau and Lemoine occupied key positions in Paris. Pichegru and Willot spent the morning in the Tuileries Palace. The troops that were supposed to defend the elected assemblies joined the coup or melted away. Pichegru, Willot and Barth√©lemy were arrested but Carnot managed to escape abroad. They and 51 others were sentenced to be transported to Sinnamary (Cayenne) where it was expected that the so-called \\"dry guillotine\\" of tropical diseases would soon kill them. The carriages that took the prisoners to the seaports were fitted with iron bars so none could escape. Pichegru and three other deportees escaped from French Guiana by boat on 3 June 1798, but Willot and Fran√ßois Aubry fell desperately ill with fever and were unable to join them. Aubry soon died but Willot recovered and got away that same month. In 1799, Pichegru and Willot actively plotted to stir up Royalist revolts in France. On 1 June 1799, Pierre Marie Barth√©lemy Ferino wrote to the French army commander Andr√© Mass√©na that Pichegru, Willot and Carnot were traveling with Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen, the commander of the Habsburg Austrian army. Ferino was wrong about Carnot but correct about the others. Pichegru planned to lead the rebellion in Franche-Comt√©, Willot in Marseilles and Louis Fran√ßois Perrin de Pr√©cy in Lyon. Their efforts came to nothing because Mass√©na won his masterly victory at the Second Battle of Zurich on 25 September 1799. Though he could have taken advantage of the amnesty after the Coup of 18 Brumaire on 9 November 1799, Willot was too deeply involved as a Royalist; he chose to remain in exile. In 1800, he formed a corps of Royalist volunteers with the purpose of attacking the south of France. Soon afterward, he took refuge with King Ferdinand of Naples who appointed him commandant of Elba. In 1802 Willot went first to Menorca and then to London. Finally, in 1804 he traveled to the United States where he had contact with the exiled Jean Victor Marie Moreau. On 21 July 1813 he left the United States for England. After Emperor Napoleon abdicated in 1814, Willot returned to France with King Louis XVIII. During the Hundred Days of Napoleon's return from exile, he withdrew to Ghent in Belgium. On 15 November 1815, Willot was reinstated as a general officer and became eligible for retirement pay. On 5 December that year the king made him a baron. King Louis showered honors on him the following year. The sovereign appointed him commander of the 23rd Military Division in Corsica on 20 January, made him a count on 2 March and awarded him the Commander's Cross of the L√©gion d'Honneur on 4 April 1816. Willot retired from his military post on 6 May 1818 and received the Order of Saint Louis on 1 May 1821. He died at Santenay, now in Val-de-Marne, near Paris on 17 December 1823.

It was closed in 1995; the adjacent rail yard has since been removed and replaced with a public community space. History In 1879, a narrow gauge line opened from Beachport (Rivoli Bay North) through Millicent to Mount Gambier. In 1887, the Mount Gambier railway line was constructed to Naracoorte (connecting to the Kingston-Naracoorte railway line) and Wolseley, where it joined the Adelaide-Wolseley line. On 28 November 1917, a broad gauge line opened from Mount Gambier to Heywood near Portland. In the 1950s, the narrow gauge lines were converted to broad gauge. Mount Gambier had an extensive goods yard and a locomotive depot with a roundhouse. Following the gauge conversion of the Adelaide-Wolseley and Portland lines to standard gauge in 1995, the lines closed. There are regular calls for the line to be reopened.New push for Mount Gambier railway The Border Watch 17 July 2008Penola rail pledge confirmed The Border Watch 18 July 2008Portland railyards given the shunt Portland Observer 13 February 2008 In the late 1990s to early-mid 2000s, the Limestone Coast Railway, operated tourist services on the abandoned lines from Mount Gambier to Penola and Coonawarra Tantanoola, Millicent, Renick with Redhen railcars. However, due to increased insurance costs, the service ceased 1 July 2006. In 2013, the old yard was lifted and covered with grass.Breathing Life into the Rail Lands City of Mount GambierOld Mount Gambier rail corridor demolition begins The Border Watch 14 October 2013Mount Gambier rail lands project takes shape ABC South East SA 4 June 2014 The station building was then operated by radio station Lime FM. In 2015, after over a year of work, the Railway Lands was completely transformed into a public community space. 20,000 square metres of turn covered the entire former-industrial site. The grand opening in November saw thousands of residents come together to utilise the area. A \\"back to nature\\" playground, wheelchair-accessible barbecues, a pond with a creek, native plants, a labyrinth, plus many more features for the community to use.

It was part of the San Lorenzo Unified School District. It opened in September 1964 on Wicks Boulevard with only freshman, sophomore and junior classes. Donald Hayes was the architect of Marina High, which gave Marina its distinctive roofline. The students mostly came from the former Foothill High School in Hayward. The first graduating class at Marina was in 1966 and the last graduating class was in 1982. Marina mainly served the Washington Manor area of San Leandro, and approximately 1,200 students attended each year of its existence. Forrest S. Lindsay was the first principal, from 1964 to 1973. Roosevelt Bergmann was the principal from 1974 to 1982. Marina's athletic teams were known as The Titans, and their school colors were royal blue and white. The Titans competed in the HAAL league in American football, baseball, basketball (the Titans had their first winning season in 1969-70), golf, badminton, gymnastics, soccer, swimming, tennis, track, wrestling, G.A.A. baseball and G.A.A. basketball.

He is often referred as Avi Cohen II or Avi Cohen of Jerusalem to distinguish himself from the player of the same name, born in 1956. Career Cohen began his career at Beitar Jerusalem, initially as a striker, but moved back to the right back position. Because of this, he was noted for his attacking skills, and was one of the first players in Israel to adopt the style of the attacking defender. He left Beitar in 1985 to join Maccabi Sha'arayim, but returned a season later. He would remain there until the summer of 1989, where he was signed by Maccabi Tel Aviv. It was at Maccabi where he would be known as Avi Cohen of Jerusalem, as Avi Cohen became his teammate (albeit briefly, as he would leave to join Maccabi Netanya the following year). In his first two seasons, he scored three and six times respectively, but in the 1991‚Äì92 season, his goalscoring prowess really came to the fore. Maccabi won the title for the first time in twelve years, and Cohen scored twenty goals in all competitions (18 in the league, 2 in the State Cup), winning the Footballer of the Year award later that year. In the 1992‚Äì93 season, Maccabi would lose the title to Cohen's previous club, Beitar, but still won silverware, in the form of the Toto Cup. Cohen won the State Cup in 1994, the only trophy that had eluded him up to that point. He still maintained his better than average goal scoring total for a defender, with eight in all competitions. The following season, he won the title for the second time with Maccabi, but suffered a back injury and had to retire. International career Due to his attacking style of play, he was a welcome addition to the Israel national football team, making 32 appearances and scoring three times.

Since then, the Hornets have recorded ten playoff appearances under two different franchises. Early years 1985‚Äì1988: birth of the Hornets In 1985, the NBA, with 23 teams, was planning to expand by four teams by the 1988‚Äì89 season. George Shinn, an entrepreneur from Kannapolis, North Carolina, wanted to bring an NBA team to the Charlotte area, and he assembled a group of prominent local businessmen to head the prospective franchise. The Charlotte area had long been a hotbed for college basketball. The Atlantic Coast Conference's four North Carolina teams, as well as local teams UNC Charlotte, Davidson, and Johnson C. Smith, had large and loyal fan bases. Charlotte was also one of the fastest-growing cities in the United States, and was previously one of the three in-state regional homes to the American Basketball Association's Carolina Cougars, from 1969 to 1974. Some critics doubted that Charlotte, then mostly known for banking, could support an NBA team; one Sacramento Bee columnist joked, \\"The only franchise Charlotte is going to get is one with Golden Arches.\\" However, Shinn's ace in the hole was the Charlotte Coliseum, a state-of-the-art arena under construction that would seat almost 24,000 spectators ‚Äì the largest basketball-specific arena to serve as a full-time home for an NBA team. On April 5, 1987, NBA Commissioner David Stern called Shinn to award the NBA's 24th franchise, to begin play in 1988. Franchises were also granted to Miami, Minneapolis-Saint Paul, and Orlando. Originally, the team was intended to be named the Charlotte Spirit, but a name-the-team contest yielded \\"Hornets\\" as the winning choice. That name was derived from the city's fierce resistance to British occupation during the Revolutionary War, which prompted the British commander, Lord Cornwallis, to refer to it as \\"a veritable hornet's nest of rebellion\\". The name had been used for previous Charlotte sports teams, including a minor league baseball team from 1901 to 1972, and a World Football League team that played there from 1974 to 1975. In addition the Charlotte 49ers and Davidson Wildcats of the NCAA play annually for the Hornets' Nest Trophy. The team received attention when it chose teal as its primary color, setting off a sports fashion craze in the late 1980s and early 1990s, with many pro and amateur clubs soon following with teal in their color schemes. The team's uniforms were designed by international designer and North Carolina native Alexander Julian, and featured a first for NBA uniforms‚Äîpinstripes. Similar designs by the Orlando Magic, Toronto Raptors, Houston Rockets, Chicago Bulls, and Indiana Pacers followed soon after. Shinn hired Carl Scheer, a longtime NBA executive, as the team's first general manager. Scheer sought a roster of veteran players, hoping to put together a competitive team as soon as possible, with a goal of making the playoffs in five years. Former college coach and veteran NBA assistant Dick Harter was hired as the team's first head coach. In 1988, the Hornets and the Miami Heat were part of the 1988 NBA Expansion Draft. Unlike many expansion franchises that invest in the future with a team composed entirely of young players, Charlotte stocked its inaugural roster with several veterans in hopes of putting a competitive lineup on the court right away. The team also had three draft picks at the 1988 NBA draft. 1988‚Äì1991 In their inaugural season the Hornets were led by ex-Pistons guard Kelly Tripucka, who provided instant offense and was Charlotte's top scorer for the franchise's first two seasons. Other notable players included sharpshooting rookie (and first draft selection) Rex Chapman, a long-distance scoring threat, and floor general Muggsy Bogues, the shortest player in NBA history at 5'3\\". The Hornets' first NBA game took place on November 4, 1988, at the Charlotte Coliseum, and was a 133‚Äì93 loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers. The opening night lineup included Tripucka, Kurt Rambis, Dave Hoppen, Robert Reid, and Rickey Green. Four days later, the team notched their first victory over the Los Angeles Clippers, 117‚Äì105. On December 14, in a win over the Indiana Pacers, Tripucka scored 40 points. Tripucka would score 40 points twice more that season. On December 23, 1988, the Hornets really gave their fans something to cheer about, beating Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls 103‚Äì101 at the buzzer in Jordan's professional debut in North Carolina. Muggsy Bogues set a club record on April 23, handing out 19 assists in a game against the Boston Celtics. The Hornets finished their inaugural season with a record of 20 wins and 62 losses. Despite concerns that the Coliseum was too big, the Hornets were a runaway hit in their first season, leading the NBA in attendance, a feat they would achieve seven more times in Charlotte. Eventually, the Hornets would sell out 364 consecutive games‚Äîalmost nine consecutive seasons. The Hornets' second season was a struggle from start to finish. The team lost their first five games before defeating the Orlando Magic in the first meeting between the two franchises. Members of the team rebelled against Dick Harter's defense-oriented style, and he was replaced mid-season by assistant Gene Littles following a dismal 8‚Äì32 start. Despite the change, the team continued to struggle during the second half, suffering through a 3‚Äì31 stretch from January through March. In the end, the team took a step backwards, finishing the season with a disappointing 19‚Äì63 record ‚Äì one game worse than their previous season. In the 1990 NBA draft, the Hornets selected guard Kendall Gill with the 5th overall pick. The team showed improvement during the 1990‚Äì91 season. They won eight of their first 15 games, including a 120‚Äì105 victory over the Washington Bullets. However, the team went cold, losing their next 11 games and falling to 8‚Äì18. The Hornets, who hosted the 1991 NBA All-Star Game, finished their third season with a 26‚Äì56 record. Despite the team's seven-game improvement over the previous season, Gene Littles was fired and replaced by general manager Allan Bristow. Playoffs and success 1991‚Äì1995 With the first pick in the 1991 NBA draft, the Hornets drafted power forward Larry Johnson from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Johnson had an impact season, finishing among the league leaders in points and rebounds, and winning the 1992 NBA Rookie of the Year Award. Additionally, Guard Kendall Gill led the club in scoring, averaging over 20 points per game. The team stayed in contention for a playoff spot until March, but in the end, they finished the season with a record of 31‚Äì51. Despite continuing to improve, the Hornets failed to qualify for the playoffs for the fourth consecutive season. =1992‚Äì1993: first playoff appearance= The Hornets were in the lottery again in 1992 and won the second overall pick in the draft, using it to select Georgetown center Alonzo Mourning. The Hornets now had two 20‚Äì10 threats in Johnson and Mourning, who with Kendall Gill, formed perhaps the league's top young trio. The team finished their fifth season at 44‚Äì38, their first-ever winning record and good enough for the first playoff berth in franchise history. Finishing fifth in the Eastern Conference, the Hornets upset the Boston Celtics in the first round, with Mourning winning the series with a 20-footer in game four. However, the Hornets lacked the experience and depth to defeat the New York Knicks, falling in five games in the second round. The Hornets finished the 1993‚Äì94 season with a 41‚Äì41 record, narrowly missing the playoffs. Despite injuries to both Johnson and Mourning, the two led the team in points-per-game. The following season, the Hornets finished the regular season with 50 wins and 32 losses, and returned to the playoffs. Johnson and Mourning again led the team in points-per-game, while also leading the club in rebounding. However, Charlotte was bounced from the playoffs in the first round, falling to the Chicago Bulls in four games. Following the season, the Johnson‚ÄìMourning era would come to an end, as the Hornets traded Mourning to the Miami Heat for forward Glen Rice, center Matt Geiger, and guard Khalid Reeves. 1995‚Äì1998 Glen Rice would make an immediate impact after joining the Hornets, leading the team in scoring and points-per-game during the 1995‚Äì96 season. While Rice and Johnson provided high-powered scoring, Geiger tied with Johnson for the team lead in rebounds, and All-Star guard Kenny Anderson ran the point for the injured Muggsy Bogues. The Hornets were competitive, but failed to qualify for the playoffs during the season, again finishing with a 41‚Äì41 record. Bristow resigned at the end of the season, and was replaced by NBA legend Dave Cowens. The 1996 off-season was again marked by vast changes: Anderson declined to re- sign, Johnson was shipped to the Knicks for power forward Anthony Mason, and the team made a trade on draft day 1996. They acquired center Vlade Divac from the Los Angeles Lakers for the rights to Kobe Bryant, who the Hornets picked 13th in the draft. The new-look Hornets were successful, with Divac and Geiger providing the center combination, Mason averaging a double-double, Bogues back at the point, and Rice having the finest season of his career. The team achieved the best season in its history at the time, finishing with 54 victories compared to only 28 losses, and making it back to the playoffs. Rice finishing third in the league in scoring, earning all-NBA second team honors, and was also the All-Star Game MVP, setting several scoring records. Despite the success during the regular season, the Hornets went down rather meekly to the Knicks in three straight games. The 1997‚Äì98 season was also successful. Muggsy Bogues was traded two games into the season, and the team picked up point guard David Wesley and shooting guard Bobby Phills. With Wesley, Phills, Rice, Mason, and Divac, the Hornets romped through the regular season, finishing with a 51‚Äì31 record; Rice had another good season, as he finished sixth in league scoring and earned all-NBA third team honors. The Hornets made it to back-to-back playoffs for the first time in franchise history, and advanced to the second round, only to again be stopped by the Bulls. End of an era 1998‚Äì2002: final years of original Hornets The 1998‚Äì99 season was turbulent. The season didn't start until February, as the lockout shortened the regular season to only 50 games. Glen Rice was traded to the Lakers for Eddie Jones and Elden Campbell, and Dave Cowens resigned midway through the season, with the highest winning percentage among Hornets head coaches. He was replaced by former Celtics teammate Paul Silas, who became the franchise's fifth head coach. The team finished the season with a 26‚Äì24 record, but failed to qualify for the playoffs. The 1999‚Äì2000 season saw a return to prominence, with the addition of point guard Baron Davis, the third overall draft pick. The Hornets tore through much of the season, but tragedy struck on January 12, 2000, when fan favorite and top reserve Bobby Phills was killed in an automobile accident. The Hornets retired his No. 13 on February 9, 2000. After finishing with a 49‚Äì33 record, the team returned to the playoffs, where they lost to the Philadelphia 76ers in the first round. The season, however, was overshadowed by events off the court. The team's popularity had begun to sag due to fan discontent with owner George Shinn's personnel moves; he had reportedly traded Mourning and other stars out of an unwillingness to pay market value. Additionally, Michael Jordan, a North Carolina native, began negotiations to become part-owner, but talks collapsed when Shinn refused to grant Jordan control over basketball operations. Because of this, season attendance dropped to eleventh in the league. In the 2000‚Äì01 season, with the additions of Jamal Mashburn and P.J. Brown, the Hornets managed to return to the playoffs, finishing with a 46‚Äì36 record. While they upset the third-seeded Heat in the first round and made it to the conference semifinals for the third time in franchise history, they lost to the Milwaukee Bucks in seven games. Despite continuing to play well, their popularity continued to fall, with the team finishing 21st in the league in attendance. The Hornets returned to the playoffs the following season, finishing the regular season at 44‚Äì38. After defeating the Orlando Magic in the first round, they were upended by the New Jersey Nets in five games in the Conference Semifinals. The team finished twenty-ninth (last) in the league in attendance, a stark contrast to their earlier years in Charlotte. Before the Hornets were eliminated from the playoffs, the NBA approved a deal for the team to move to New Orleans following the season. 2002‚Äì2003: relocation to New Orleans Many attributed the Hornets lapse in popularity during the late 1990s and early 2000s to the team's owner, George Shinn, who was slowly becoming hated by the fans. In 1997, a Charlotte woman claimed that Shinn had raped her, and the subsequent trial severely tarnished his reputation. The consensus was that while Charlotte was as basketball-crazy as ever, fans took out their anger at Shinn on the team. Shinn was also discontented with the Charlotte Coliseum, which, although considered state-of-the-art when it opened in 1988, had a limited number of luxury boxes. On March 26, 2001, both the Hornets and the Vancouver Grizzlies applied for relocation to Memphis, Tennessee, which was ultimately won by the Grizzlies. Shinn issued an ultimatum: unless the city built a new arena at no cost to him, the Hornets would leave town. The city initially refused, leading Shinn to consider moving the team to either Norfolk, Louisville, or St. Louis. Of the cities in the running, only St. Louis had an NBA-ready arena (Savvis Center, now known as the Enterprise Center) already in place and was a larger media market than Charlotte at the time; also, it was the only one of the four to have an previously had hosted an NBA franchise ‚Äî the St. Louis Hawks, who moved to Atlanta in 1968. Finally, a new arena in Uptown, which would eventually become the Charlotte Bobcats Arena (later to become Time Warner Cable Arena and now known as the Spectrum Center), was included in a non-binding referendum for a larger arts-related package, and Shinn withdrew his application to move the team. Polls showed the referendum on its way to passage. However, just days before the referendum, Mayor Pat McCrory vetoed a living wage ordinance. The veto prompted many of the city's black ministers to oppose the referendum. They felt it was immoral for the city to build a new arena when city employees weren't paid enough to make a living.World Class City, Third World Paycheck . Creative Loafing, 2001-12-29 After the referendum failed, city leaders devised a plan to build a new arena that did not require voter support, but made it known that they would not consider building it unless Shinn sold the team. While even the NBA acknowledged that Shinn had alienated fans, league officials felt such a demand would anger other owners. The city council refused to remove the statement, leading the Hornets to request a move to New Orleans ‚Äì a move which would eventually return pro basketball to the city after the Jazz moved to Salt Lake City in 1979. The NBA approved the move and as part of the deal, the NBA promised that Charlotte would get a new expansion franchise. 2002‚Äì2004: establishing the Bobcats Shortly after the New Orleans relocation, the NBA became receptive to adding an expansion team in Charlotte for the 2004‚Äì05 season, if an arena deal could be reached. Several ownership groups, including one led by former Boston Celtics star Larry Bird, made bids for the franchise. On December 18, 2002, a group led by Black Entertainment Television founder Robert L. Johnson was awarded the franchise,, with Johnson becoming the first African American majority owner in major U.S. professional sports. The rapper Nelly became a co-owner. In June 2003, the team was named the Bobcats. The Charlotte Regional Sports Commission \\"Help Name The Team\\" effort drew over 1,250 suggestions. The three finalists were Bobcats, Dragons, and the eventual winner Flight, referencing North Carolina's \\"First in Flight\\" status due to the Wright Flyer as well as the state's military bases. But \\"Flight\\" was eventually discarded by Johnson and the team, being considered too abstract and reminiscent of the then-current Iraq War aerial strikes. During the summer of 2003, at a street festival crowd of 7,000 fans, the franchise unveiled \\"Bobcats\\" as the team name. The bobcat, according to the North Carolina Wildlife Commission, is an athletic, fierce predator indigenous to the Carolinas. Since Charlotte was already home to the Carolina Panthers of the National Football League, designer Chris Weiller created the team logo to alay confusion or close comparison. There was suspicion that owner Robert \\"Bob\\" Johnson chose \\"Bobcats\\" as a play on his name. The Bobcats hired Bernie Bickerstaff as the first head coach and general manager. A new arena to host the Bobcats at uptown Charlotte began construction on July 2003, and the team played its home games at the Coliseum until the new building was ready. After failed attempts at the ballot box to force the team to fully fund the arena, city politicians implemented a hotel and leisure tax in Charlotte to help pay for it. Basketball returns to Charlotte 2004‚Äì2008: the beginning  The Bobcats held their expansion draft on June 22, 2004, picking up youngsters Gerald Wallace, Primo≈æ Brezec, and Jason Kapono. They also drafted talented European players Predrag Drobnjak, Sasha Pavloviƒá, and Zaza Pachulia, however they would be cut before the season opener. Shortly after, they traded with the Los Angeles Clippers to acquire the second pick in the 2004 NBA draft, which they used to select Emeka Okafor, a center from Connecticut. The Bobcats' first game of the 2004‚Äì05 season took place on November 4 at the Charlotte Coliseum, losing 103‚Äì96 to the Washington Wizards. Two days later, they won their first game in franchise history over the Orlando Magic, 111‚Äì100. On December 14, the Bobcats beat the New Orleans Hornets 94‚Äì93 in overtime in the Hornets first game in Charlotte after their move to New Orleans. However, the Bobcats mostly struggled during their inaugural season, finishing with a record of 18‚Äì64, never winning more than two games in a row.2004‚Äì05 Charlotte Bobcats Schedule and Results Emeka Okafor performed well, winning the 2004‚Äì05 NBA Rookie of the Year Award. In the 2005 NBA draft, the Bobcats drafted Raymond Felton and Sean May from North Carolina. With them, in addition to Okafor and Wallace, the team hoped to build a solid foundation for future success. In their second season, the Bobcats opened the new Charlotte Bobcats Arena with an overtime victory over the Boston Celtics. Despite struggling again for most of the year, they managed to close out the season with four straight wins to finish with a record of 26‚Äì56, an eight-game improvement over their inaugural season. After the season, the Bobcats announced that NBA legend and North Carolina native Michael Jordan had bought a minority stake in the team, becoming the second-largest shareholder. As part of the deal, he became head of basketball operations. Though Bickerstaff remained general manager, Jordan had the final say on all basketball matters. The Bobcats showed some improvement during the 2006‚Äì07 season, with a playoff- hopeful record of 22‚Äì33 by late February 2007. However, the team went through an eight-game losing streak and dropped their record to 22‚Äì41 by early March 2007. Following the slump, Michael Jordan announced that head coach Bernie Bickerstaff would not return the following season, but would finish coaching the current season. The Bobcats won 11 of their last 19 games of Bickerstaff's tenure to finish their third season with a 33‚Äì49 record. In three seasons with the Bobcats, Bickerstaff finished with an overall record of 77‚Äì169. Front office and coaching were key focuses for the Bobcats during the 2007 offseason. Rod Higgins was hired as general manager, and Sam Vincent was hired as the second head coach. Phil Ford was added to the coaching staff over the summer, and another position was filled when Buzz Peterson was hired from Coastal Carolina University to become director of player personnel. In the 2007 NBA draft, Brandan Wright was selected by the Bobcats with the eighth pick, then traded to Golden State in a deal that sent Jason Richardson to Charlotte. The Bobcats were unable to capitalize on offseason moves, finishing the 2007‚Äì08 season with a disappointing 32‚Äì50 record. The team, which had felt confident the season would end with its first playoff berth, struggled amid rumors of players clashing with the coach. Only lasting one year, in which he struggled with personnel decisions, Vincent was fired on April 26, 2008. 2008‚Äì2010: the Larry Brown era On April 29, 2008 the Bobcats hired Basketball Hall of Famer Larry Brown as the third head coach in franchise history. With the ninth selection of the 2008 NBA draft, the Bobcats selected D. J. Augustin from Texas. On December 10, 2008, a little over a month into the season, the Bobcats traded their leading scorer, Jason Richardson along with Jared Dudley to Phoenix in exchange for Boris Diaw and Raja Bell. The trade turned out to be quite successful as the team came very close to reaching the franchise's first playoff berth during the 2008‚Äì09 season, but finished four games out of eighth place with a team record of 35 wins and 47 losses. Team members voiced frustration at management for hosting the Charlotte Jumper Classic, an equestrian event, at the end of the season. The scheduling conflict forced the Bobcats to play their final four games on the road, virtually ending their playoff hopes. Following the season, Robert L. Johnson announced he was putting the team up for sale. Playoffs, new ownership, and struggles 2009‚Äì2010: arrival of Michael Jordan and playoffs During the offseason, Gerald Henderson from Duke was chosen by the Bobcats with the 12th pick in the 2009 NBA draft. They traded Emeka Okafor for New Orleans Hornets center Tyson Chandler, and acquired Stephen Jackson and Acie Law from the Golden State Warriors. On February 27, 2010, Robert Johnson announced the sale of the team to Michael Jordan, making him the first former NBA player to become majority owner of a franchise. On April 9, 2010, the Bobcats clinched their first playoff berth with an exciting 104‚Äì103 road win over the New Orleans Hornets, finishing the 2009‚Äì10 season at 44‚Äì38, the team's first winning record. Gerald Wallace was a huge factor in the run to the playoffs as he became the first Bobcats player selected as an NBA All- Star. However, in the first round of the playoffs, the Bobcats were swept by the Orlando Magic, quickly ending their season. 2010‚Äì2012: the worst season in NBA history The Bobcats began the 2010‚Äì11 season with high hopes following the previous season's success. Despite the departures of key players Raymond Felton and Tyson Chandler, the Bobcats started their season hoping to once again make the playoffs. However, they struggled early, and on December 22, 2010, following a dismal 9‚Äì19 start, Michael Jordan announced that Larry Brown had stepped down as head coach. That same day, veteran coach Paul Silas returned to Charlotte for the first time since 2001. On February 24, 2011, at the NBA trade deadline, the Bobcats moved to clear salary cap space by sending former all-star forward Gerald Wallace to the Portland Trail Blazers for two first round draft picks, Joel Przybilla, Sean Marks, and Dante Cunningham. They also sent veteran center Nazr Mohammed to the Oklahoma City Thunder for D. J. White and Morris Peterson. Going down the stretch, the injuries to Stephen Jackson and Tyrus Thomas derailed any chances of Charlotte trying to catch the Indiana Pacers, who swept them 4‚Äì0 in the regular season to secure the eighth spot in the east. In the end, the Bobcats finished the season with a 34‚Äì48 record, finishing 25‚Äì29 under Paul Silas. On June 13, 2011, the Bobcats hired former Portland Trail Blazers general manager Rich Cho for their own GM and promoted Rod Higgins to President of Basketball Operations. On the day of the 2011 NBA draft the Bobcats sent Stephen Jackson, Shaun Livingston, and the 19th overall pick to the Milwaukee Bucks. In return, the Bobcats received former Duke star Corey Maggette and the 7th overall pick. They used that pick to draft forward Bismack Biyombo and then drafted Kemba Walker, the NCAA Basketball Tournament Most Outstanding Player, with the 9th pick in the draft. They also traded their 2013 second-round draft pick to the Thunder for 7-footer Byron Mullens and signed sharpshooter Reggie Williams in free agency. The Bobcats started the 2011‚Äì12 season with a close 96‚Äì95 win against Stephen Jackson and the Milwaukee Bucks in their home opener but wins would be scarce after that. In the lockout-shortened season the Bobcats struggled and posted an NBA-worst record of 7‚Äì59, losing the last 23 games of the season. In a nationally televised game against the New York Knicks the Bobcats recorded yet another loss as their win rate dropped to 0.106, setting the record for the worst season by an NBA team (because the season was shortened by the lockout, the 1972‚Äì73 Philadelphia 76ers kept the record for most losses in a season, with 73). On April 30, 2012, the Bobcats announced that Silas would not return to the team for the 2012‚Äì13 season. St. John's assistant Mike Dunlap was named his successor. Despite having the best chance of winning the draft lottery, the Bobcats did not get the first pick. In the 2012 NBA draft, the Bobcats selected Michael Kidd-Gilchrist with the second overall pick. They also selected Jeffery Taylor with the thirty-first pick. They added Ben Gordon, Ramon Sessions and Brendan Haywood. The Bobcats' first game was against the Indiana Pacers, and they won 90‚Äì89 with a heated last minute battle, snapping their 23-game losing streak. On November 13, 2012, the Bobcats traded guard Matt Carroll to the New Orleans Hornets for power forward Hakim Warrick. The team seemed to rebound with a 7‚Äì5 start to the season in which 6 of the 7 wins were by 4 points or less. However, they promptly went on an 18-game losing streak from which they never recovered, snapping the streak in a victory at Chicago on New Year's Eve. They finished 21‚Äì61, the second-worst record in the league. On April 23, 2013, Dunlap was fired, reportedly because the players were turned off by his heavy-handed coaching style. Dunlap would be replaced by former Los Angeles Lakers assistant head coach Steve Clifford. The Hornets return 2012‚Äì2014: final years of the Bobcats On May 21, 2013, Jordan announced the franchise had applied to change its name to the Charlotte Hornets for the 2014‚Äì15 NBA season, pending a majority vote by the NBA Board of Governors at a meeting in Las Vegas on July 18, 2013. Deputy Commissioner and COO Adam Silver had previously said it could take 18 months, but the fact that the league owned the rights to the Hornets name could speed up the process. The New Orleans Hornets had recently changed their name to the New Orleans Pelicans for the 2013‚Äì14 NBA season. On July 18, 2013, the NBA unanimously approved the Charlotte Bobcats to reclaim the Hornets name at the conclusion of the 2013‚Äì14 season. During the 2013 NBA draft, the Bobcats selected power forward/center Cody Zeller with the 4th overall pick. The Bobcats would also get former Utah Jazz player Al Jefferson during the free agency period. On November 22, in a widely expected move, the Bobcats announced they would adopt a modified version of the original Hornets' teal- purple-white palette, with black, gray and light blue as accents. The team unveiled its future logo during halftime of their December 21 game against the Utah Jazz, in a ceremony featuring former Hornets players Dell Curry (now the Bobcats' television color commentator), Muggsy Bogues, Rex Chapman and Kelly Tripucka. The team then started a campaign to hype the Hornets' return, entitled \\"Buzz City.\\" On January 16, 2014, the Bobcats revealed new Charlotte Hornets logo shirts, hats and gear. On February 20, 2014, the Bucks traded Gary Neal and Luke Ridnour to the Bobcats for Ramon Sessions and Jeff Adrien. Charlotte clinched a playoff berth for the second time in franchise history on April 5, 2014, when they won a road game against the Cleveland Cavaliers. On April 10, 2014, the Bobcats signed forward DJ White for the rest of the season. The Bobcats finished the 2013‚Äì14 regular season at 43‚Äì39, their second highest number of wins in a season. The Bobcats were swept by defending champions Miami Heat in the first round of the 2014 NBA Playoffs. The fourth game was also the last one as the Charlotte Bobcats. 2014‚Äì2018: return of the Hornets and the birth of Buzz City On May 20, 2014, the Bobcats became the second incarnation of the Charlotte Hornets. At a press conference, team officials also announced that the renamed Hornets reclaimed the history and records of the 1988‚Äì2002 Hornets, while all of the Hornets' records during their time in New Orleans from 2002 to 2013 remained with the Pelicans. Charlotte had already been using footage of the original Hornets as part of the \\"Buzz City\\" campaign. To summarize: after the 2002 season, the original Hornets moved to New Orleans. In 2004, Charlotte was granted a new franchise, the Bobcats. After the 2013‚Äì14 season, the Bobcats changed their name back to the Hornets and reclaimed the history and records of the 1988‚Äì2002 Hornets. As a result, the Hornets are now deemed as having suspended operations from 2002 to 2004, while the Pelicans are deemed as having joined the league in 2002 as an expansion team. In the 2014 NBA draft, the Hornets had the No. 9 pick from a trade with the Detroit Pistons, which they used to select Noah Vonleh from Indiana. In the same draft they acquired UConn Husky Shabazz Napier (24th overall pick), Dwight Powell from Stanford, and Semaj Christon from Xavier in the second round, later trading Napier to the Miami Heat for P. J. Hairston from the Texas Legends of the NBA Development League (formerly from UNC), the rights to the 55th pick (Semaj Christon), their 2019 second-round pick and cash considerations; Powell and Brendan Haywood to the Cleveland Cavaliers for Scotty Hopson and cash considerations; and Christon to the Oklahoma City Thunder for cash considerations. The Hornets then traded Hopson to the New Orleans Pelicans in exchange for cash considerations. During the 2014 first year of free agency as the renamed Hornets, the Hornets signed former Indiana Pacers shooting guard Lance Stephenson for three years at $27 million with a team option in the third year. The Hornets also signed former Utah Jazz and Atlanta Hawks forward Marvin Williams to a two-year, $14 million contract. They later added former New Orleans Pelicans guard Brian Roberts, who became the first player in the modern-day Hornets era to play for both the New Orleans Hornets and the Charlotte Hornets. Charlotte finished the 2014-2015 season with a 33‚Äì49 record. After the stressful first season as the \\"reborn\\" Hornets, the Hornets signed and traded for promising young NBA players such as Nicolas Batum, former Knicks star Jeremy Lin, Jeremy Lamb, Tyler Hansbrough, Spencer Hawes and undrafted rookie Aaron Harrison. In the 2015 NBA draft, the Hornets selected Wisconsin star Frank Kaminsky with the 9th pick. Through the first 16 games of the 2015-2016 season the Hornets were 9‚Äì7, including a 7-game home winning streak. This marked first time they were multiple games above .500 since the 2013 season. After Feb. 1, the Hornets went 25‚Äì9 in the regular season, which became the third-best winning percentage (.736) in that time span, with only the Warriors and Spurs having better marks. On April 2, the Hornets clinched a playoff spot. The Hornets finished 48‚Äì34, 3rd overall in the division, with their most regular season victories since the 1999‚Äì2000 season. Charlotte earned the No. 6 seed in the Eastern Conference playoffs, where they played No. 3 seed Miami in the first round. The Heat cruised by Charlotte in the first two games, however the Hornets won game 3 96‚Äì80, marking the franchise's first playoff victory since 2002. Charlotte won the next two games, including a close game 5 in Miami, but lost a crucial game 6 at home. Miami promptly beat the Hornets in game 7, ending their 2015-2016 season.http://espn.go.com/blog/statsinfo/post/_/id/117682/how-the-heat- dominated-game-7 The following year the Hornets slumped, finishing 2016-2017 with a 36‚Äì46 record.

Early life and education Murray-Smith's father ran a lucrative business shipping Australian horses to India for the armed forces. It enabled the family to live in Toorak, one of Melbourne's wealthiest suburbs, and to send Stephen to board at Geelong Grammar School from 1934. He described his home as \\"bookless\\", adding however that his mother was \\"a voracious reader all her life\\", getting her books from the circulating and public libraries.Stephen Murray-Smith, Indirections: A Literary Biography, Foundation for Australian Literary Studies, James Cook University of North Queensland, Townsville, 1981, p. 13. The business, and the wealth, came \\"to a dead end in 1938, when the Indian army mechanised\\",Murray-Smith, Indirections, p. 4. but generosity from the school and from Murray-Smith's grandfather allowed him to remain at Geelong Grammar and complete his schooling in 1940. Murray-Smith later described Geelong Grammar as \\"a good but conservative middle-class school\\".Murray-Smith, Indirections, p. 25. In his position as secretary of the Public Affairs Society at the school he \\"invited Ralph Gibson of the Communist Party down to talk to us at school‚Äîunder J.R. Darling it was that kind of school\\".Murray-Smith, Indirections, p. 19. He spent a year at the University of Melbourne before enlisting in the army at the end of 1941. An avid reader from childhood, he recorded that in the three years before he enlisted he read 314 books, of which only one, Francis Ratcliffe's Flying Fox and Drifting Sand, was Australian. War and university In July 1942 he embarked for New Guinea, where he served as a Bren gunner in a commando unit, the 2/5th Independent Company. His unit fought the Japanese at Wau. He contributed to the company's history after the war, of which John McLaren says, \\"His accounts of the travails of the track, the disastrous attack on a Japanese post, the hazards of allied air support, and the hilarious mismanagement of the retreat from Wau describe vividly what it was like to be an infantryman in trying conditions and at the end of a long chain of command.\\"John McLaren, \\"Stephen Murray-Smith: His Legacy\\", La Trobe Journal, No. 82, Spring 2008, p. 20. Murray-Smith later recalled: \\"The army consolidated the two important lessons I had already learned from boarding school: how to stay alive under difficulties, and the idiocy of authority.\\"Murray-Smith, Indirections, p. 23. After his discharge in early 1945 he resumed his studies at Melbourne, completing an honours Arts degree in history followed by a Dip.Ed., while taking a prominent part in student politics with his close friend Ian Turner. Europe and Overland He joined the Communist Party of Australia in 1945. In early 1948, in a civil ceremony in Melbourne, he married Nita Bluthal, whose Jewish family had arrived in Australia from Poland in 1938. From 1948 to 1951 he and Nita lived in London and Prague, where he worked for the news agency Telepress. They returned to Melbourne, and bought a house in the outer bayside suburb of Mount Eliza. Murray-Smith worked as the organising secretary of the Australian Peace Council from 1952 to 1958, and became a prominent member of the Melbourne Realist Writers' Group.The Oxford Companion to Australian Literature, Oxford University Press, Melbourne, 1994, pp. 562‚Äì63. He edited several editions of the Group's magazine, Realist Writer, from 1952 to 1954. In 1954, with financial assistance brokered by Judah Waten, he founded the quarterly literary magazine Overland.Murray-Smith, Indirections, p. 30. Overland, said Murray-Smith later, aimed \\"to talk of books and writing in an unselfconscious way with the assumption that there was no reason whatsoever why 'ordinary people' should not enjoy such writing and participate in it\\".Murray-Smith, Indirections, p. 31. In 1958, when Ian Turner was expelled from the Communist Party, Murray-Smith resigned his membership. In order to prevent the Communists taking over Overland, he and Turner took the subscriber lists and hid them.Murray-Smith, Indirections, p. 37. Murray-Smith was determined that Overland should \\"avoid the dreadful humorlessness and dogmatism of the fully convinced\\".Murray-Smith, Indirections, p. 39. He continued to edit Overland until his death in 1988. Academic career Murray-Smith worked for the Victorian Teachers‚Äô Union from 1958 to 1961, then returned to the University of Melbourne, as research fellow, then as lecturer, then as reader in education by the time of his retirement in 1987. He completed a PhD in 1966. His thesis, \\"A History of Technical Education in Australia: With special reference to the period before 1914\\", is one of the university library's most- read theses.McLaren, p. 21. He edited the annual publication Melbourne Studies in Education from 1973 to 1982. He called himself \\"a historian by profession\\" whose \\"special areas of historical research\\" were \\"technical education, on the one hand, the regional history of the Bass Strait area, and culture conflict therein, on the other\\". From the early 1960s until his death he and his family and friends camped every year on the otherwise uninhabited Erith Island in Bass Strait. He edited two books about the Bass Strait islands. In 1981 he was appointed AM. He compiled two reference books in the 1980s, the 464-page Dictionary of Australian Quotations (1984) and Right Words: A Guide to English Usage in Australia (1987), which aimed \\"to apply an Australian understanding to words\\". He intended to produce further editions of Right Words,Stephen Murray-Smith, Right Words: A Guide to English Usage in Australia, Viking, Ringwood, 1987, pp. viii-x. but this was one of several projects his death precluded. Values Murray-Smith espoused what he called \\"radical nationalism\\",Murray-Smith, Indirections, pp. 45-60. adding that Australia's radicals \\"should not seek to destroy the past, but to build on it\\".Murray- Smith, Indirections, p. 49. In 1981 he wrote: > I am a man whose emotional roots are in a simpler, less cosmopolitan > Australia. I am grateful for my years in the Communist Party and for my > involvement with the Jewish community, because these events have prevented > me from being just another middle-aged, middle-class ex-public schoolboy, > but deep down and far back my Australia is an Australia of the work ethic, > of the dunny in the back yard ... of men going to football matches with hats > on; and of the expansion of the Australian suburb, surely in many respects > an original and beneficent Australian \\"invention\\".Murray-Smith, > Indirections, p. 14. Death and legacy He died of a heart attack on 31 July 1988 at his home in Mount Eliza. His family buried his ashes under a cairn at Erith Island. He and Nita had a son and two daughters. One of their daughters, Joanna, is a playwright. Her play Fury (2013) explores \\"how the children of radical parents struggle to define themselves\\". She says of her parents, \\"For a good part of their life together ... they were completely absorbed in their ideology\\", but later they \\"were very cynical about people who stayed in the Communist Party. In fact, they were sceptical about any hardline ideologies.\\" The State Library of Victoria has held an annual Stephen Murray-Smith Memorial Lecture since 1992, with the aim of promoting \\"research and debate in the broad areas of Stephen's interest and influence\\".

In 1666, the church acquired an octagonal oratory adjacent to this church. The convent was suppressed by the Napoleonic government, and in 1862 was given to the city. The church, reflecting the earlier medieval structure, has a single nave. The altars were created along the nave. The first altar on the right has an altarpiece with the Immaculate Conception with Saints Cajetan and Tecla (1714) by Biagio Puccini nel 1714. The main altar was designed by Venanzio Bigioli. The ceiling of the presbytery was decorated by Paolo Marini. The walls have depictions of the Life of St Phillip (1922-1923) by Mario Adami and Nicola Angelelli.

Located on Canwick Hill, overlooking the city of Lincoln, in England, the centre opened to the public at the end of January 2018. The official ceremonial opening of the centre was held on 12 April 2018, as part of the 100th anniversary celebrations of the RAF. Lincolnshire Bomber Command Memorial The project is owned and run by the Lincolnshire Bomber Command Memorial (a registered charity), with the digital archive being created in partnership with the University of Lincoln. Objectives The project was created to act as a point of \\"recognition, remembrance and reconciliation for Bomber Command\\". IBCC aims to tell the personal stories of service men and women of RAF Bomber Command, ground crews and civilians affected by the bombing campaigns on both sides of the conflict during the Second World War. The centre provides a comprehensive record of the role of Bomber Command's squadrons and digitally displays historical documents and photographs relating to the activity of Bomber Command. IBCC Digital Archive The IBCC has created a digital archive on Bomber Command integrating oral histories, photographs, diaries, letters and service records. Much of the archive has never been available for public access before. Around 1,200 oral history interviews with veterans and survivors of the bombing have been recorded and 200,000 items have been preserved by the archive's staff and volunteers. Losses Database The IBCC has a comprehensive record of Bomber Command Losses. It holds the records of all losses from 1936 - 1968 and includes details of the individual, their crew, details of how they were lost and, where available, photographs, epitaphs and AIR records. This amounts to almost 4 million pieces of individual data all available to use for free via the website. Funding The Heritage Lottery Fund contributed ¬£3.1 million of funding towards the ¬£16 million cost of building the centre, ¬£2.1 million through the Chancellor's Libor funds. Other funds have been donated by private individuals and other grant funding bodies. Canwick Hill site Location A view of Lincoln Cathedral from near Canwick Hill The city of Lincoln was selected for the location of the IBCC because 27 RAF Bomber Command stations (over a third of all Bomber Command stations) were based in the county during the Second World War. The large amount of airfields led to Lincolnshire being nicknamed \\"Bomber County\\". Located at Canwick Hill, the centre is just under two and half miles from RAF Waddington, which suffered the greatest losses of any Bomber Command station, and close to the former Avro aircraft production facility at Bracebridge Heath. A view of Lincoln Cathedral, a prominent landmark for aircrews, forms an important part of the vista from the centre of the Memorial Spire. Chadwick Centre The visitor centre is named after Roy Chadwick, the designer of the Lancaster bomber The Chadwick Centre includes an education suite, an interactive and immersive exhibition across three galleries, visitor facilities and a collections room. The centre relates the experiences of service personnel in Bomber Command and the effects of bombing on civilian populations. The centre also covers both the war time and post-war review of the bombing campaigns undertaken during the Second World War. The centre has already collected over 1,200 personal experiences of Bomber Command veterans from around the world, as well as from civilians affected by the bombing campaigns and civilians recording the consequences for Lincolnshire of having so many RAF personnel arrive. Spire Memorial The memorial spire Within the grounds of the International Bomber Command Centre the Spire Memorial was erected on 10 May 2015. The memorial is a spire, reflecting the connection to Lincoln Cathedral. Created out of Corten A weathering steel, it is based on the dimensions of the wingspan of a Lancaster bomber, being 102 ft (31.09 m) high and 16 ft (5 m) at the base. The spire was officially unveiled in October 2015 to an audience of 3,600 guests, including 312 RAF veterans. The spire is encircled by walls carrying the names of all 57,871 men and women who gave their lives whilst serving in or supporting Bomber Command. This is the only place in the world where all these losses are memorialised. Peace Gardens Plates bear the names of aircrew who lost their lives flying from bases in Lincolnshire. These include a Memorial Avenue as part of the Lincolnshire Peace Garden, with geo-located trees for each of the 27 Lincolnshire stations, an International Garden with planting beds representing the five continents and 62 nations involved with Bomber Command, an amphitheatre for outdoor education and areas of sensory planting. The Peace Gardens incorporate a Ribbon of Remembrance, made of laser cut Scoutmoor yorkstone, that enables families, associations and nations to mark those who served.

Description Rhoshill is a collection of about twenty houses at an elevation of , surrounded by farmland, and the local name given to the hill which runs westwards from the hamlet. On some maps the hill to the south of Rhoshill is marked as Windy Hill. An area of the hill is marked as Mynydd Crogwy, but the significance of this is not clear as there is no direct translation (although crogwyr means hangman). Rhoshill is in the parish of Cilgerran and is administered by Cilgerran Community Council. It is home to an agricultural engineering company and a number of other business including a herb grower (medicinal and culinary) and holiday lets. History The north- south road (now the A478) running through Rhoshill formed part of a drovers' road moving local and Irish livestock as far away as England, a practice driven by demand for centuries. Even after the coming of the railways, stock would still have been moved from farms to Cilgerran or Crymych railway stations by road. A pre-1850 parish map shows an inn at Rhos-hill, while later 19th century Ordnance Survey maps show that Rhoshill had two pubs, the Foundry Arms and the Bronwydd Arms, and a post office, all of which have since closed and become private dwellings. The Bronwydd Arms was subject to a receivership order in 1891. Chapel Ty Rhos Chapel Ty Rhos Chapel is to the northeast of Rhoshill.

The Johannesburg Vrijwilliger Corps was founded and largely financed by Mr. S.H. van Diggelen, who was commissioned by President Paul Kruger as its commander with the rank of lieutenant colonel. The first meeting to form the Corps was held in Van Diggelen's office on 18 September 1894, with subsequent meetings on 19 September 1894 and 27 March 1895. The first meeting in 1894, as the date on the medal suggests, could be considered the day on which the Johannesburg Vrijwilliger Corps was established. The official date of disbandment appears to be 1 January 1899. Actions The Johannesburg Vrijwilliger Corps took part in two significant actions. The first was at Doornkop from 29 December 1895 to 2 January 1896, to suppress the planned Johannesburg Uitlander Revolution and against the Jameson Raid, an unsuccessful British-backed attempt to overthrow the Zuid Afrikaansche Republiek government.Christie's, The Art People - Sale 1232, Lot 6, Johannesburg Vrijwilliger Corps Medal 1894-99, Bronze, Unnamed As Issued, Edge Bruising, About Very Fine (Lot notes) (Access date 27 April 2015)DNW Auctions - Orders, Decorations And Medals (22 June 1999) - Lot 164 - Johannesburg Vrijwilliger Corps Medal 1894-99, bronze, unnamed as issued, edge bruising, otherwise very fine and very rare ¬£400-600 (Access date 27 April 2015) The second was the Swaziland Expedition in 1898. The Expedition took place following the murder of the Chief Induna Mbaba at Zomboti, the seat of the Swazis, in April 1898. At the time of the murder, Swaziland was administered by the Republican Government and the expedition seems to have consisted mainly of patrols for the maintenance of order in that country. Between these two actions, Van Diggelen had also offered his unit's services to the British South Africa Company Administrator in Salisbury during the Second Matabele War in Matabeleland in April 1896, but his offer was declined with thanks. Institution The Johannesburg Vrijwilliger Corps Medal was instituted in 1899 by Lieutenant Colonel Van Diggelen to award to the officers and men of the Corps. Whilst the medal does bear the coat of arms of the Zuid Afrikaansche Republiek, which may indicate official sanction, it appears that Van Diggelen arranged and paid for the award himself.The Soldier's Burden - The DTD, ABO and LvW - Awards to the Boer Side: Anglo Boer War 1899‚Äì1902, by Henk Loots (Access date 29 January 2015) The medals were awarded after the conclusion of the Swaziland Expedition. Two clasps were also awarded, the Jameson Inval en Revolutie te Johannesburg 1895‚Äì1896 clasp and the Swazieland Expeditie 1898 clasp. It is not known how many of these medals were awarded, but only ten are known to still exist. Description The medal is a disk, 47 millimetres in diameter and struck in bronze. Without suspender, it weighs 48.42 grams. A bronze ring suspender, formed from 1.65-millimetre- diameter wire, passes through a hole in a spherical bronze knob, 7 millimetres in diameter and fused to the top of the medal. The medal was minted by Messrs. Begeer of Utrecht in Holland, now known as Naamlooze Vennootschap Atelier voor Edelsmeed- en Penningkunst voorheen Koninklijke Begeer, Voorschoten.

Status While privately instituted military decorations and medals do not enjoy official status, as a result of not having been formally instituted or sanctioned by the fount of honour at the time, and while none of them were therefore allowed to be worn with military uniform, some have become well-known and have acquired recognition in South Africa's military medal history. Four of these decorations and medals are considered to be significant.South African Medal Website - Legal aspects - Fount of Honour (Accessed 1 May 2015) * Sir Harry Smith's Medal for Gallantry of 1851. * The Johannesburg Vrijwilliger Corps Medal of 1899. * The Kimberley Star of 1900. * The Cape Copper Company Medal for the Defence of O'okiep of 1902.

The house was demolished in 1898. The site now lies under the southeast corner of the Old War Office Building on Whitehall, near the Gurkha Memorial statue on Horse Guards Avenue. Background Vanbrugh made his first essays in architecture earlier in the 1690s, when he was engaged by Charles Howard, 3rd Earl of Carlisle to design his palace at Castle Howard in Yorkshire. Vanbrugh was a well-known playwright, and was friends with the prominent Whigs through his membership of the Kit-Cat Club, but he had no previous formal education in drawing or architectural design. After most of the Palace of Whitehall was destroyed by a fire in 1698, the King William III granted Vanbrugh permission to build a house in the grounds of the ruined palace in July 1700, in the location where the lodgings of the Vice-Chamberlain ‚Äì Vanbrugh's friend Peregrine Bertie ‚Äì had been. Description Vanbrugh's small, two-storey house was constructed in 1701 to his own novel design, reusing brick and stone from the ruined palace. It stood on a plot approximately east to west, fronting the Great Court at Whitehall, and from north to south. The house had 7 bays in its main elevation, but departed from the convention of having a main elevation in one plane, with rectangular windows in identical bays. The main block of Vanbrugh's house was formed of five bays. The central three bays were rusticated on the first and second floors, and each floor had three large round-arched windows, spanned by an iron-railed balcony on the first floor. To each side, a further bay projected on both floors, like a tower, with rusticated quoins and rectangular window openings. The outermost bays, in plain ashlars, projected further on the ground floor only, with a broken triangular pediment above an opening with a round-headed arch supported by pillars. The first floor of the outer bays was set back, and built of brick without stone facings. Although small, the house was in a prominent position, and drew attention to Vanbrugh's architectural aspirations. While conventional town houses of modest size were usually terraced, Vanbrugh's house was free- standing. Its size and proportions, and peculiar design, with unusual mix of elevations and projections, led the house to be unflatteringly likened by Jonathan Swift to a \\"goose-pie\\", a dish known for its odd shape. In a poem of 1703, \\"Vanbrugh's House\\", Swift wrote: \\"At length they in the rubbish spy // A thing resembling a goose-pie.\\" The disparaging nickname stuck. (Swift returned to his abuse of Vanbrugh in a poem in 1708, writing: \\"Van‚Äôs genius, without thought or lecture, // Is hugely turn‚Äôd to architecture\\".) History Vanbrugh repeated the motif of three long round-headed windows at Castle Howard, and on the corner pavilions at Blenheim Palace. He repeated the rusticated central block with plainer projecting wings at Seaton Delaval Hall. Vanbrugh died in the house in 1726, and the lease was inherited by his wife. She left the property to her niece Mrs Philippia Goldsworthy for life, and then to her daughter Miss Martha Carolina Goldsworthy, but they sold it to Edward Vanbrugh. The house was acquired by Charles Stuart in 1793, and left to his widow Dame Anna Louisa Stuart. It was occupied by their son, Charles Stuart, 1st Baron Stuart de Rothesay, until it was bought by the United Service Institute in 1845 to expand its adjacent museum. The museum was transferred to the Banqueting House in 1895, and the house was demolished in 1898 to allow construction of the Old War Office Building.

The site was identified in 1999 by retired real estate investor Hubert Zeitlmair, a follower of Zecharia Sitchin, but it was never studied properly and archaeologists are not convinced that the site is actually a temple. Site The site is located on an underwater plateau approximately 2 km off the coast of St. Julian's. The plateau is 900 by 500 metres long, and its highest point seems to be man-made, and is 19 metres below sea level. The site contains large boulders which Zeitlmair believed to be man-made and not natural, and which are covered in vegetation. Zeitlmair describes it as consisting of a cluster of three stone circles with 'rooms' with a diameter of 9 to 11 metres, with parts having a height up to 6 to 10 metres. An 'avenue' goes up to the entrance of the structure, which faces east. Tracks on the seabed resembling cart ruts were also observed on the site. Discovery The site was discovered on 13 July 1999 by Shaun Arrigo and his brother Kurt, who were working under the instructions of Hubert Zeitlmair, a retired German real estate investor interested in pseudoarchaeology. The discovery was reported in the local media in October 1999, but after some time interest died down. Further explorations of the site were conducted by Zeitlmair in November 1999 and May 2000. Zeitlmair believes that the temple was built by aliens in around 10,000 BC to 12,000 BC, and was submerged at the end of the Ice Age during the Genesis flood narrative. He states that he has been guided by his \\"primeval ancestors, namely... the God Pa.tha-i-da.na Asu.ara tSi.dha, and the Goddess Ashtar-tara Queen of Atlantis\\" who he met on Malta. His judgment does not fit within Malta's prehistoric chronology, as the earliest known human habitation of the island began in around 5900 BC. The site was given the name ƒ†ebel ƒ°ol-Baƒßar, meaning \\"Stones in the Sea\\" in the Maltese language. It has also been linked with the island of Atlantis, and Zeitlmair has published a book about this in German. Analysis Maltese archaeologists are not convinced that the site is a megalithic temple. Other people who dived there said that the boulders which make up the site are not megalithic, but are modern ones which were dumped illegally. Mark Rose, Online Editorial Director for the Archaeological Institute of America, has written that \\"Chronology appears to be somewhat confused in Zeitlmair's interpretation. According to the web site, he sees links between the submerged \\"temple\\" and both Noah's Flood and the rise in sea level following the end of the Ice Age (the period to which, he told Maltamag, he hopes studies will show the Maltese temples date). Furthermore, the presence of deeper sand deposits on the west side of the \\"ruins,\\" the side toward Gibraltar, than on the east side is taken as an indication that the flooding of the Mediterranean by Atlantic waters (which really did occur) was involved in the inundation of the \\"temple.\\" The Mediterranean flooding, however, took place some five million years ago. As to the builders of the temples, Zeitlmair defers to Zechariah Sitchin.\\" References External links *Video about ƒ†ebel ƒ°ol-Baƒßar Megalithic Temples of Malta Underwater ruins St. Julian's, Malta Pseudoarchaeology 1999 archaeological discoveries ","title":"ƒ†ebel ƒ°ol-Baƒßar"},{"id":"46532030","text":"Hank Lott (born October 7, 1974) is a former Republican member of the Mississippi House of Representatives for the 101st District.

Following the death of co- founder Byron Hardin, their son Mike Hardin assumed operating responsibilities and ultimately took over the management following his mother's death in 1989. Hardin moved the restaurant to its current location on Newport Avenue in Ocean Beach, later opening additional restaurants in Petco Park and on the corner of 10th Avenue and Broadway. Mike Hardin died in 2015, leaving the business to his children Shane and Lexi. Hodad's has received positive reception for its burgers, especially its bacon cheeseburger. It was featured on Guy Fieri's TV show Diners, Drive-ins and Dives. Since appearing on the show, the restaurant enjoyed a large increase in sales, often selling thousands of burgers daily. It has also been included on multiple \\"best of\\" lists, including CNN's nationwide list of \\"Five tasty burger joints worth visiting\\" in 2009 and in 2015 on Foursquare's top 50 \\"best burger joints in America.\\"  History  A photograph of a woodcut memorial portrait of late Hodad's owner Mike Hardin. Surrounding it are license plates donated to the business. Husband and wife Byron and Virginia Hardin originally ran a restaurant in 1969 called Hardin's Barrel, in El Cajon, San Diego. In 1973, they purchased a burger stand in Ocean Beach, San Diego for $600 () and called it Hodad's, the name originating as a surfing term for a non-surfer who pretends to be one. The restaurant moved to a larger venue on Voltaire Street in 1979 after the previous landlord doubled the rent, at which point the business started to see increased turnover and success. Hodad's moved to its current location on Newport Avenue in 1991, taking just four days to open. The restaurant expanded into a second location in downtown San Diego on the corner of Broadway in 2011, named \\"Hodad's Too\\" and approximately twice the size as their other outlet. Hodad's began selling its products in Petco Park after signing a partnership with the San Diego Padres. To celebrate this partnership, Mike Hardin threw the first pitch at the July 5, 2012 Padres game versus the Cincinnati Reds. As of 2015, the restaurant estimated that it sells between 1,200 and 1,500 hamburgers daily. Hodad's is popular among both tourists and locals, with queues at times taking hours to get through.  Management  From its inception in 1973 until 1984, the restaurant was co-owned by Byron and Virginia Hardin. Their son, Mike Hardin, became co-owner when his father died in 1984. He assumed greater responsibility with business partner Terry Rhodes when his mother died in 1989. Mike Hardin was called a local icon by Discover San Diego and the San Diego Union-Tribune. Mike Hardin died on February 5, 2015, having suffered a heart attack and a makeshift memorial for was created by the community in front of the Ocean Beach restaurant. The restaurant closed during February 6 and 7 to honor both him and another employee, and was reopened on February 9. Hundreds of people attended a public memorial ceremony in late March at the Petco's Park location, including Guy Fieri. His son Shane and daughter Lexi became co-owners of the restaurant chain in 2015. In an interview with SD News, Shane discussed the pressures of taking over the business as well as both modeling his behavior after his father and establishing his own identity as its owner.  Menu  The Blue Jay burger and onion rings. Hodad's is known for its bacon cheeseburgers, fries, onion rings, and giant milkshakes. At the original beach location, Hodad's served burgers for 25 cents (), with burger prices ranging from $4.25 to $8.25 by 2015. When Mike Hardin took over the business, he began to create burgers with large portions and in 2013, created the Guido Burger, inspired by Guy Fieri and his nickname 'Guido,' who featured Hodad's on his show, Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives. Another burger is the Blue Jay, a bacon cheeseburger with blue cheese and grilled onions. Hodad's bacon patties are of a similar consistency to that of a hash brown.  Decor  A wall of the restaurant. It shows several license plates donated by people as well as its menu. Hodad's walls are decorated with numerous license plates, while stickers can be found at both Newport Avenue and 10th Avenue locations. Mike Hardin had previously said that everything in the Ocean Beach location is provided by customers. Other decor at Hodad's Too includes skateboards and surfboards on the wall as well as a surfboard table. Its style has been described as beach-like and biker-chic.  Reception  Guido Burger and onion rings, named after Guy Fieri Hodad's has received positive reception for its burgers and style. It appeared on an episode of \\"The Best Thing I Ever Ate\\" on the TV channel Food Network. The restaurant's bacon cheeseburger has been lauded by Guy Fieri, and in 2009 CNN included it on a list of \\"Five tasty burger joints worth visiting.\\" Hodad's was featured in one of San Diego Magazine \\"Everyday Eats\\" articles, which covers budget food options. In 2015 Foursquare ranked the restaurant 26th on its list of 50 \\"best burger joints in America.\\" In an article by Hoodline, Hodad's burgers ranked number 3 out of 50 for quality burgers under $10. The San Diego Union-Tribune included it in its list of the 30 best burgers in San Diego. Times of San Diegos Hoa Quach included it in a list of restaurants to celebrate Father's Day in San Diego. Serious Eats writer Erin Jackson gave it a positive review due to its bacon cheeseburger. The Daily Meal included it in its top 50 list of the best french fries in the U.S. Houston Press writer Robb Walsh argued that the burger was not actually the best in the country. San Diego Readers Ian Pike included its burgers in his list of the most overrated burgers in San Diego, suggesting praise for them came from the sunk cost fallacy, although was more positive about their milkshakes.

Ryzhov's cavalry attacked over the Causeway Heights (with its line of redoubts marked \\"1\\" to \\"6\\") at approximately 09:15, and were met by the Sutherland Highlanders at the hill north of Kadikoi (marked \\"B\\"). The Thin Red Line is an 1881 oil-on-canvas painting by Robert Gibb depicting the 93rd (Sutherland Highlanders) Regiment of Foot at the Battle of Balaclava on 25 October 1854, during the Crimean War. In an incident which became known as \\"The Thin Red Line\\", a two-deep line of around 500 red- coated Scottish infantry from the Highland Brigade ‚Äì with support from around 1,000 Royal Marines and Turkish infantry along with six guns of field artillery ‚Äì stood firm against a force of around 2,500 Russian cavalrymen. The incident was a small one, in the context of the battle and the war as a whole, but became the focus for celebrating the stoicism and steadfastness of the British Army after Gibb's painting was exhibited. Background The Russians were moving to attack the British base of operations at the port of Balaclava. After the Russians captured defensive redoubts on the Causeway Heights to the north of Balakava from around 6am on 25 October, about 2,500 Russian cavalry commanded by Lieutenant General Ivan Ivanovich Ryzhov were sent to probe forwards at around 9 am. The small force of British and Turkish infantry was the last line of defence before Balaklava, but was sheltering from Russian artillery fire behind a hill north of Kadikoi, about north of Balaclava. The infantry moved to defend the top of the hill, and around 400 of the cavalry, possibly four squadrons of the 12th Ingermanland Hussars, were ordered to charge them. The Turkish infantry fired one ineffective long-distance volley and retreated, but the British infantry remained in place. Their commander Sir Colin Campbell decided against forming his six companies of Highlanders into square, the usual defensive tactic, or even a more robust formation of four ranks: instead, the vulnerable line of infantry fixed bayonets and fired several volleys with their Mini√© rifles. The body of cavalry split into two, swerved aside, and withdrew. The war correspondent of The Times, William H. Russell, observed the scene, later describing the Russian cavalry as charging at a \\"thin red streak tipped with a line of steel\\", which later became known as \\"the thin red line\\". Thinking that an unsupported line of infantry could not hold back a cavalry charge, General Ryzhov assumed there was a stronger force out of sight behind the line of Highlanders, and the remainder of its cavalry held its position. Within a few minutes, the Russians were forced to retreat after the Charge of the Heavy Brigade. The Highlanders remained in their defensive position until the battle concluded a few hours later, after the disastrous Charge of the Light Brigade. Painting The painting was inspired by Gibb's reading of Alexander Kinglake's book The Invasion of the Crimea. It shows the blue-coated Russian cavalry within a few yards of the red-coated British infantry, much closer than was actually the case in the battle: in reality, the cavalry came no closer than . Gibbs obtained a Highlander's uniform to ensure the accuracy of his depiction, from the feather bonnets to the kilts and sporrans (including the large badger head sporran worn by the bearded sergeant at the right end of the line). The painting was one of three by Gibb on Crimean War themes, the others depicting incidents from the Battle of Alma (Alma: Advance of the 42nd Highlanders, 1889) and the Battle of Inkerman (Saving the Colours; the Guards at Inkerman, 1895). The painting was first exhibited in Edinburgh, at the Royal Scottish Academy on Princes Street. The painting was on loan from owners Diageo to the Scottish National War Museum in Edinburgh Castle from 2000 until 2016, after which it was donated to the national collection.https://www.ft.com/content/b1943bae- acc2-11e6-9cb3-bb8207902122 References * The Thin Red Line, National Museums Scotland * The 93rd Highlanders and the ‚ÄòThin Red Line‚Äô, Military History Monthly, 11 January 2011 * The Thin Red Line, 25 October 1854, National Army Museum * Highlander: The History of The Legendary Highland Soldier, Tim Newark, pp. 116‚Äì119. 1881 paintings Horses in art War paintings Military of Scotland ","title":"The Thin Red Line (painting)"},{"id":"46532116","text":"Harvey Fillingane (born December 11, 1938) is an American Republican politician.

In 1960 Diem set up a National Security Council, designed to regularly bring together \\"the General Staff, the Defense Staff, the Ministry of Interior,\\" and other officials.Duncanson (1968), p. 240 (NSC, quote). With regard to territorial administration, \\"the Ministry of Interior exercised supervision over questions of finance and supply.\\"Duncanson (1968), p. 235 (quote). The Ministry's responsibilities likely ranged from issues involving police work and counterinsurgency, to civil administration of rural populations.Goodman (1973), p. 181, (scope of an interior minister's bailiwick in late 1960s). The Interior Ministry indirectly affected land reform programs. Under Diem, an influx of army officers into the position of Province Chief across the South Vietnamese countryside unintentionally worked to weaken the civilian administration.Duncanson (1968), pp. 236 (Province Chiefs), 240 (land reform). Chief Justice In 1968 the National Assembly, meeting in Saigon and following the newly adopted Constitution,Keesing's (1970), pp. 117‚Äì123: Constitution of 1967. chose Tran Minh Tiet and eight others as the new Justices of the Supreme Court. Only \\"lawyers, prosecutors, and presiding judges\\" had been eligible. Of those chosen, only three including Tiet had received more than 100 Assembly votes. The Assembly members had so acted despite the fact that during 1967‚Äì1968 Tiet had on occasion \\"been openly critical of President Thieu and his administration\\".Penniman (1972) p. 107 (Assembly chooses Tiet as Justice; 100 votes; two quotes). Tiet had become \\"known for his honesty and independence.\\"Tran Ngoc Chau (2012) p. 357 (quote). Following the Assembly's establishment of the Supreme Court, its nine newly minted members then chose as their first Chief Justice: Tran Minh Tiet.Penniman (1972), p. 107 (Chief Justice). The Republic of Vietnam's Constitution of 1967 contained provisions for the Supreme Court.Keesing's (1970), p. 122 (summary of section V \\"The Judiciary\\" of the 1967 Constitution). It was described as \\"the highest court of appeal with authority to pass on the constitutionality of legislation.\\" The Court was also to act as \\"the final judge of presidential elections [with the] power to outlaw political parties.\\" The National Assembly chose the members of the Supreme Court after a screening process.Penniman (1972), pp. 106‚Äì107 (Constitution, quotes). \\"[T]he Supreme Court legally became the equal of the legislative and executive branches [under the] Constitution of 1967\\" but the president retained formidable powers.Nguyen Ngoc Huy pp. 99‚Äì108, at 99‚Äì100, 99 (quote), in Donnell and Joiner (1974).

Apparently, Tr·∫ßn Minh Ti·∫øt and Tr·∫ßn Ng·ªçc Ch√¢u are not related. President Thieu (1967‚Äì1975) had become determined to prosecute Chau in court and then have him sent to prison, despite his legislative immunity as a deputy in the National Assembly. Thieu put strong political pressure on the legislature, and issued threats against its members.Goodman (1973), pp. 119‚Äì120.Cf., Joiner (1974), pp. 281‚Äì282. Consequently, Chau was arrested and then tried by a military court. The Supreme Court, however, invalidated Chau's prison sentence. One commentator opines that the case established \\"the supremacy of the civil over the military judiciary\\" and further \\"declared the independence of the legislative and judicial structures\\".Joiner (1974), p. 282 (quotes).Penniman (1972), p. 108, text at note 7. Although \\"the Supreme Court ruled that the sentence was illegal... it did not order his release.\\"Penniman (1972), p. 108 (quote). > \\"The Supreme Court was not by any definition a serious block to executive > misuse of power, nor did its members advance such pretenses.

He was then taken to Long Thanh Re- education Center. There along with him were \\"hundreds of senior judges, cabinet members, senators, congressmen, provincial governors, district chiefs, heads of various administrative and technical departments, and political party leaders\\" from the fallen government of South Vietnam. They received the victorious regime's new instructions on the ruling party's ideology. After several years, he was moved to Thu Duc Prison, from which he was later released.Tran Ngoc Chau (2012), pp. 367 (quote), 372 (Thu Duc Prison).

History  The discovery of the most reliable source stating that Kutai Martadipura is the oldest kingdom in the nusantara archipelago is in yupa inscriptions.Vogel, J.Ph., 1974.The Yupa Inscriptions of king Mulawarman from koetei (east borneo).BKI:Berlin Seven pieces of yupa were found in Muara Kaman. According to the results of a study conducted by J.G. de Casparis (1949), yupa-yupa in Muara Kaman which allegedly a Kutai Martadipura civilization heritage were found successively in 1879 and 1940.Vogel, J.Ph., 1974.The Yupa Inscriptions of king Mulawarman from koetei (east borneo).BKI:Berlin In yupa-yupa, found there are inscriptions using Pallawa script in Sanskrit language. Letters engraved on yupa thought to have come from the end of the 4th century or early 5th century AD. All the monument stone was issued at the command of a leader named Maharaja Mulavarman Naladewa.Marwati Djoened Poesponegoro & nugroho notosusanto, 1993. Sejarah nasional Indonesia II. Balai pustaka:Jakarta Mulavarman allegedly are Indianize name of indigenous people because the name of his grandfather, namely Kudungga (there is also a mention kudunga or kundungga) is the original name of the indigenous Indonesian. Kudungga is what is believed to be the forerunner of the first leader of the kingdom of Kutai Martadipura, while Mulavarman is the successor Asvavarman (son of Kudungga) which brings the kingdom of Kutai Martadipura at the glory. R.M. Ng. Poerbatjaraka (1952) interpret the circuit Pallava inscriptions in Sanskrit recorded on yupa about the genealogy of the kings who had ruled in the early days of the kingdom of Kutai Martadipura in translation:R.M.Ng.Poerbatjaraka, 1952. Riwajat Indonesia I. Jajasan Pembangunan:Jakarta Translation: From inscription of heritage above can be concluded that the first king of Kutai Martadipura, is Kudungga. Kudungga has a son named Asvavarman who then pass the leadership in the kingdom of Kutai. Asvavarman have three children's. Of the three children's Aswawarman have, there is a child who is the most prominent, a child name is Mulavarman as crown prince.R.M.Ng.Poerbatjaraka, 1952. Riwajat Indonesia I. Jajasan Pembangunan:Jakarta  Ancestry   Name Origin  The belief that Kudungga is indigenous Indonesian people based on the investigation that Kudungga clearly not Indian name, although the names of his descendants, Aswawarman and Mulawarman, containing elements of Indian name. In this case. Poesponegoro and Notosusanto (1993) states that there is a name that is similar to Bugis, namely Kadungga. The resemblance of this name is considered not just a coincidence given in South Sulawesi also found several inscriptions similar to what is found in Kutai. Poesponegoro and Notosusanto (1993) further concluded that the most likely, both Kudungga who named his son Asvavarman and Asvavarman himself named his son Mulavarman, eager to equate their degree and their descendant align with the knight caste as in India. This possibility based on the fact that the word \\"varman\\" is derived from the Sanskrit word which is usually used to suffix the names of people in southern India. In the Hindu tradition that comes from India, the social system of society is divided into classes, known as levels where the warrior caste or aristocratic kingdom included in a respectable caste.  Latest Claim  The latest claim came from newly reestablished Kutai Mulawarman Kingdom (direct descendant of Sultanate of Kutai Kartanagara) in Indonesia, Maharaja Kudungga is a king of Bakulapura in Tabalrung. Kudungga is son of King Atwangga and King Atwangga is son of Mitrongga, which is descendant of Emperor Pushyamitra Shunga from Shunga Empire in Magadha, India. During Kudungga rule, Shunga Empire no longer exist, and his successor Ashvavarman, use varman to state that his caste is kshatriya. These claims however are one sided, and unsubstantiated with no historical records proving Atwangga and Mitrongga ever existed.

It is a plaintext message, along with relevant metadata (headers), that is placed into a traffic net by an amateur radio operator. Each radiogram is relayed, possibly through one or more other amateur radio operators, to a radio operator who volunteers to deliver the radiogram content to its destination.  Form overview  Radiogram forms facilitate a standard protocol between amateur radio operators, allowing much faster relay of formal messages. They do this by always having the message headers in a certain order, allowing operators to read and understand the headers without explicit verbal labels. This is especially important in hectic and stressful environments such as during a disaster, when many parties call upon radio operators to quickly transfer messages in and out of the affected areas. A typical form has a place for the plaintext message, as well as for several headers that are important for routing the message to its proper destination in a timely manner. These fields include the message's priority, the callsign of the station of origin (the amateur radio operator who placed the message onto the message net), the date and time of origin, contact information of the message's recipient, as well as the callsign of the station that delivered the message. The headers' purpose and order is logical and intuitive enough that many amateur radio operators have memorized it and in extremis can transmit and receive radiograms without referring to the form. Preamble part All messages must have a preamble. The preamble of the message contains information about the message necessary to keep track of it as it passes through the amateur system. The parts of the preamble, except for the check as noted later, are NOT changed by any station relaying or delivering the message. They are permanent parts of the message created by the station of origin and must remain with the message all the way to the delivery point. Preamble information is used to service undeliverable messages and to generate replies to specific handling instructions. Message number The message number is selected by the station originating the message and it must be on all messages. It stays with the message all the way to the point of delivery. The delivering station may need to reply to the station of origin and refer to this number. Use number digits only, no letters, leading zeros, or dashes. Numbers are usually begun with 1 at the start of a year or month at the pleasure of the originating station. Message precedence Letter(s) used to indicate the precedence of the message, and must be on all messages. See the latest Precedence full definitions from ARRL (From ARRL FSD-3). =Precedences= PRECEDENCES (ARRL FSD-3, 2/94) EMERGENCY (Spelled out on form.): Any message having life and death urgency to any person or group of persons, which is transmitted by Amateur Radio in the absence of regular commercial facilities. This includes official messages of welfare agencies during emergencies requesting supplies, materials or instructions vital to relief of stricken populace in emergency areas. During normal times, it will be very rare. On CW/RTTY, this designation will always be spelled out. When in doubt, do not use it. * EMERGENCY: Emergency is always spelled out in the preamble. Means other than Amateur Radio should be included in the delivery options. EMERGENCY messages have immediate urgency. They should take priority over any other activity and should be passed by the best means available with the cooperation of all stations. * PRIORITY (P): Use abbreviation P on CW/RTTY. This classification is for a) important messages having a specific time limit, b) official messages not covered in the emergency category, c) press dispatches and emergency related traffic not of the utmost urgency, d) notice of death or injury in a disaster area, personal or official. * WELFARE (W): This classification, abbreviated as W on CW/RTTY, refers to either an inquiry as to the health and welfare of an individual in the disaster area or an advisory from the disaster area that indicates all is well. Welfare traffic is handled only after all emergency and priority traffic is cleared. The Red Cross equivalent to an incoming Welfare message is DWI (Disaster Welfare Inquiry). * ROUTINE (R): Most traffic in normal times will bear this designation. In disaster situations, traffic labeled Routine (R on CW/RTTY) should be handled last, or not at all when circuits are busy with higher precedence traffic. ----- Notes: These precedences are not meant to prohibit handling lower level traffic until all higher levels are passed. Common sense dictates handling higher precedence traffic before lower when possible and/or outlets are available. * EXERCISE MESSAGES: Messages in the ARRL format passed for test and exercise purposes may be given a precedence preceded by the word ‚ÄúTEST‚Äù, as in ‚ÄúTEST R‚Äù, ‚ÄúTEST P‚Äù, ‚ÄúTEST W‚Äù, or ‚ÄúTEST EMERGENCY‚Äù. It is customary to indicate within the text of such messages the words ‚ÄúTEST MESSAGE‚Äù, or ‚ÄúEXERCISE‚Äù. Using ‚ÄúEXERCISE‚Äù as the first and last groups of the text helps alert listeners to the nature of the content to avoid undue alarm. In some exercises, the life of the message may be terminated when the exercise period is terminated, i.e., any such messages are not handled after the exercise. Consult with the ARES/RACES/NTS group conducting the test to determine if such messages should be filed, handled and delivered afterwards to permit a full evaluation of the exercise. * SERVICE MESSAGES: The precedence of a SVC message should be the same as that of the message being serviced. SVC ahead of a message number indicates a service message sent between stations relative to message handling, or delivery. Since they affect timely delivery, they are handled before routine messages. SVC is not a precedence Handling instructions OPTIONAL. Do not use handling instructions unless a particular need is present. Handling instructions are used to instruct the relaying and/or delivering operator to handle the message according to the following codes (Refer to ARRL CD 218, pink card.). If used, handling instructions must stay with the message to the point of delivery. =Handling instruction details= * HXA__ (Followed by number.) Collect landline delivery authorized by addressee within [....] miles, (If no number, authorization is unlimited.). * HXB__ (Followed by number.) Cancel message if not delivered within [....] hours of filing time; service originating station. * HXC Report date and time of delivery of the message back to the originating station. * HXD Report to originating station the identity of station from which received, plus date and time. Report identity of station to which relayed, plus date and time, or if delivered, report date and time and method of delivery (by service message). * HXE Delivering station get reply from addressee, originate message back. * HXF__ (Followed by a number.) Hold delivery until [date]. * HXG Delivery by mail or landline toll call not required. If toll call or other expense involved, cancel message and send service message back to originating station. =More than one HX code may be used= If more than one code is used, they may be combined provided no numbers are to be inserted, otherwise the HX should be repeated, thus: NR 27 R HXAC W1AW..., or, NR 27 R HXA50 HXC W1AW...(etc.). Station of origin The call sign of the amateur station originating (creating) the message for first introduction into the amateur system is the station of origin and must be on all messages. This call sign must stay with the message to the point of delivery. Service messages go to this station. Check The check is the number of word \\"groups\\" in the text of the message and must be used on all messages. This number is used by operators to verify that the text has been copied with the correct number of groups. Place of origin The PLACE OF ORIGIN is the location (city and state) of the party for whom the message is created, not necessarily the location of the station of origin. Time filed OPTIONAL. \\"TIME FILED\\" is used only when filing time has some importance relative to the precedence, handling instructions, or meaning in the text. TIME FILED is the time when the message is created by the station of origin. The time figures are in the 24-hour format followed by the letter \\"Z\\" to denote UTC time, or local time, as in \\"0215Z\\" or \\"2215EDT\\". It is acceptable to specify local time as \\"L\\", as in 2215L. UTC (Z) date and time is customary on ARRL messages (an unmarked time is assumed to be UTC). To avoid ambiguity, mark the time with a Z, time zone designator, or L. Time and date must agree, that is be related to the same time zone. The TIME FILED is normally omitted on routine traffic having no special time concerns. If used, the filing time must stay with the message to the point of delivery. Month filed Month must be used on all messages. (If TIME FILED is used, this date must agree with that time); This entry is the month in which the message is created and is written in the preamble as the three letter abbreviation: The month/day is assumed to be UTC unless marked otherwise by a time. Day filed The DAY FILED is the day of the month on which the message was originated and must be used on all messages. (If TIME FILED is used, the date and time must agree). The day is written in figures only, no leading zeros. Address The second section of the message is used to specify the name, address, city, state, zip, and telephone number of the addressee. Addressee Line 1 should contain the full name of the addressee and, if possible, it should be the name as it is most likely to be found in the local telephone directory at the point of delivery. Street address Line 2 is the street address (or institution name which might require an extra line in the address). Enter figures, street name (spell out east, west, north and south for clarity), and apartment or unit number. Sections of a city, as in SE or NW, are usually left abbreviated. City, state, zip The CITY, STATE (using standard two letter abbreviations), and ZIP code are entered without punctuation. NINE DIGIT ZIPs are written with a spelled DASH, i.e. OWINGS MILLS MD 21117 DASH 2345 Telephone number Telephone numbers are written as three groups of digits with no punctuation; area code, exchange, and number (only two groups if the area code is not required): 212 555 3245, or 555 1200 (note no hyphens used) Address op note An OP NOTE may be inserted after the telephone figures, before the text, relating to handling and/or delivery matters. The words ‚ÄúOP NOTE‚Äù are used to introduce this information when transmitting the message. OP NOTES are optional, and are generally not considered part of the message to be delivered to the addressee. They are primarily for use by the handling operators. For example, the following address with OP NOTE relates to when to attempt delivery by telephone: DONALD R SMITH 164 EAST SIXTH AVENUE RIVER CITY MD 00789 301 555 3470 OP NOTE WORKDAY ONLY Messages for other services Messages which must be re-filed with other systems, such as MARS or RACES, may require additional information such as rank, unit information, APO, etc. Find out what is required by consulting an operator in that system before accepting the message so that you are prepared to ask for what is needed. Text part The text contains the actual message information authorized by the person for whom the message was originated. Note that the amateur does not originate messages for a person without permission from that person! The text is entered in section 3 of the message form. (When transmitting a message, the text is separated from the preceding address, and the signature to follow, by the use of the word \\"BREAK\\" on voice, the prosign on CW, to allow the receiving operator to know its beginning and end. BREAK and are not counted as groups.) The text is divided into word \\"groups\\", five or ten to a line for easy counting, and is usually limited to 25 words or less. Punctuation PUNCTUATION characters are not used in the text except as follows: =/= The slash, \\"/\\", is used to separate characters within a group, as in 304/BA. Since the ‚Äú/‚Äù is part of the group it does not qualify as a separate group for the check. Although usually not used as a group by itself (a space on the left and on the right), if so used it would be counted in the check. =X= The letter \\"X\\" used to denote a period. The letter \\"X\\" is never used as the last group of the text. The ‚ÄúX‚Äù is a separate group and IS counted for the check. In a radiogram transmitted by voice, the character is read using the phonetic \\"X-ray.\\" =R= The letter \\"R\\" is used in place of a decimal in mixed figure groups, as in 7013R5 (7013.5), or 146R670 (146.670). Since the ‚ÄúR‚Äù is part of the group it does not qualify as a separate group for the check. (The inclusion of the ‚ÄúR‚Äù makes the group a ‚Äúmixed group‚Äù for transmission on voice.) =Other punctuation= OTHER PUNCTUATION is spelled out (in order to avoid confusion with prosigns used in the transmission of the message) as in \\"QUERY\\" for a question, \\"DASH\\" to separate special number or mixed groups, \\"EXCLAMATION\\", \\"COMMA\\", etc. (Hyphens are NOT used in telephone number groups or anywhere else in the text.) Such punctuation words are separate groups and ARE counted for the check. ARRL Numbered Radiograms For commonly sent messages, and for efficiency during times of radio congestion, the ARRL Numbered Radiogram brevity code may be employed. This assigns full sentences to each of 48 different numbers, which are spelled out in the message and preceded by the procedure word \\"ARL\\". For example, \\"ARL FORTY SIX\\" is the brevity code for \\"Happy birthday\\", and is expanded upon delivery outside of the NTS system to \\"Greetings on your birthday and best wishes for many more to come.\\". For purposes of the word count, \\"ARL FORTY SIX\\" is three words, and is never written down as \\"ARL 46\\". Salutations Words like \\"love\\" and \\"regards\\", often associated with signatures in formal letters, are put in the text in amateur messages (not in the signature). Counting word groups for the check The number value to be entered in the \\"CHECK\\" in the preamble of the message is the total number of groups in the text between the start and end prosigns (but not counting the prosigns). An easy rule to remember about counting word groups: ANY GROUP OF ONE OR MORE CONSECUTIVE CHARACTERS WITH NO INTERRUPTING SPACES, WITH A SPACE BEFORE IT AND AFTER IT, IS COUNTED AS ONE GROUP. Such a group may be all letters, all numbers, or any mix of numbers, letters, or slashes (/), so long as there are no spaces within the group. Each word, group of connected digits, connected mixed characters, spelled punctuation word, ‚ÄúX‚Äù, or ARL constitutes one group for the purpose of calculating the total count to enter in the check section of the preamble. The prosigns \\"BREAK\\", or on CW, at the start and end of the text are not counted. Signature part Signature The signature of the message is the name of the person for whom the message is created (not necessarily the station of origin), and any other information that person wishes to include (such as address, telephone number, title, etc.). The Place- of-Origin given in the Preamble is the location of this individual. Words like love and regards, often associated with signatures in formal letters, are put in the text in amateur messages. Amateur call signs, titles, QCWA or OOTC numbers, etc., in the signature follow the name on the same line. Addresses for the signing party are optionally included (upon request) on subsequent lines, exactly as done in the address section, but are included only if important to the originator, message purpose, or replying. Since most addressees know the party from whom messages originate, most messages in daily NTS service have simple one-line signatures. Messages for served agencies, particularly during disasters, generally require an authorizing signature in full. Messages without same may be refused. It is important for originating stations to get full information about persons for whom messages are originated in order to be able to re-contact them should a problem arise in the delivery of their message, or if a reply is received. Signature op note An OP NOTE may be inserted after the SIGNATURE, before the end of the message, relating to reply and/or servicing matters. The words ‚ÄúOP NOTE‚Äù are used to introduce this information when transmitting the message. OP NOTES are optional, and are generally not considered part of the message to be delivered to the addressee. They are primarily for use by the handling operators.

It is administrative center of the al-Hawl Nahiya consisting of 22 municipalities. At the 2004 census, the town had a population of 3,409. Al-Hawl is the site of the Al-Hawl refugee camp. During the Syrian Civil War, al-Hawl was seized by Islamic State forces, becoming one of the major ISIL strongholds in northeastern Syria. On 13 November 2015, al-Hawl was captured by the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), in what was considered as the first strategic success by the newly established SDF, bringing it into the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria.  Infrastructure  North of the town is a significant road junction connecting the provincial capital with the Iraqi border. While the northeastern branch proceeds towards Tall Hamis and the Rabia border crossing, the southeastern branch towards the Sinjar mountains passes through the town southeastwards, reaching the Makhfar Umm Jaris border crossing after some . The town is surrounded by disused military bases formerly used by the Syrian Army and abandoned in February 2013.  Al-Hawl Refugee Camp  In early 1991, during the Gulf War, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees established a refugee camp in the southern outskirts of al-Hawl, which was operated in cooperation with the Syrian government. Along with another camp in al-Hasakah, it provided shelter to at least 15,000 refugees from Iraq. Following the 2003 invasion of Iraq and the subsequent Iraq War, the camp was later reopened as one of three camps at the Iraqi‚ÄìSyrian border, when an exodus of Palestinian refugees living in Iraq occurred due to persecution by the newly-installed Iraqi government. In the context of the Syrian Civil War and the takeover of al-Hawl by the Syrian Democratic Forces, the al-Hawl camp has come to be inhabited by more than 74,000 refugees as of April 2019. More than 40,000 of these people arrived after December 2018 in a series of massive civilian evacuations from the town of Baghuz Fawqani, fleeing the fierce two- month battle for the town between the SDF and ISIL. Conditions along the road to the camp, including in screening centers for ISIL operatives, have been described as \\"extremely harsh\\" with limited food, water, shelter and no health services. Aid organizations feared dysentery and other diseases could break out from the overflow camp. The UN stated that 84 people, mostly children, died on the way to al-Hawl from December 2018 to March 2019, mostly due to hypothermia. Around 500 families in the camp are family members of ISIL fighters, including a large number of foreign nationals. They are however kept in a separate guarded section of the camp after repeated violent incidents between them and other members of the camp.  Syrian Civil War  In the course of the Eastern al-Hasakah offensive of Syrian Kurdish YPG, Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant militants were expelled from large swaths of eastern Hasakah, including Tell Hamis and Tell Brak. The southeastern Hasakah countryside around al-Hawl however remained one of the last ISIL strongholds in the province. When in October 2015, the Kurdish YPG militia and their partners, including the Sunni Arab Shammar tribe's al-Sanadid Forces, joined forces to form the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), al-Sanadid leader Bandar al-Humaydi made it an \\"immediate priority to liberate al-Hawl and Ash Shaddadi from the Islamic State.‚Äù In late October 2015, following the successful Battle of Hasakah, the SDF launched their al-Hawl offensive slowly advancing southwards from Tell Hamis. On 11 November they seized Khatuniyah and moved on around the lake further southwards to surround al-Hawl from both northeast and south on 12 November. On 13 November, al-Hawl was captured, in what was considered the SDF's first strategic success. In the following days, the SDF advanced further westwards to close the remaining ISIL-held pocket around the villages of Abu Hajirat Khuatana and Khuwaytilah.  Geography  The town is located some east of al-Hasakah, on the southern bank of the dried-out wadi ‚ÄòA≈£ƒÅ AllƒÅh. While the wadi has dried out, the spring ‚ÄòAyn al-Hawl, located south of the town, still carries water. Nearby villages include Sheikh Ma'ad with the Sheikh Ma‚Äòad shrine to the north, just across the wadi.

The album was one of the first pieces to produce a consistent psychedelic theme throughout the whole LP. All of the material featured was originally composed by the band. Despite the conflicting dates, it is generally considered the first album to use the term \\"psychedelic\\" in its title. Background Rusty Evans, the founder of the Deep, marketed a proposal to Mark Barkan to produce an album that musically replicated the experience an individual was exposed to while under the influence of LSD. This genre, psychedelic rock, had yet to surface in the wide variety of musical acts it would later encompass shortly after the album's release. Barkan accepted the offer, and Evans assembled the Deep, a studio-only group that included guitarist, David Bromberg. Shortly afterwards, Barkan had the band signed to Cameo-Parkway Records to record the album. The Deep completed the Psychedelic Moods album in its entirety at Cameo-Parkway Studios, Philadelphia in a two-day process that commenced on August 19, and concluded on August 20, 1966. On a budget of $1,200, a considerably lower margin than what was usually funded for a typical album, the band co-produced the sessions with Barkan. From New York City, the Deep traveled to Philadelphia to record the album. Six songs were previously written before the move, with six additional compositions being penned along the way to the studio to possess enough material for a full LP. Recording took place in a darkened studio, reportedly while the group was under the influence of LSD. Numerous sound effects were utilized, including, at the suggestion of Barkan, sexual moans recorded in the background. The overall sound of the tracks have been described as \\"very strange, full of weird sound effects, haunting vocals, and acid-soaked lyrics\\". With the sessions becoming increasingly erratic, the drummer unexpectedly departed, but the instrumentals were complete, so further drum tracks did not have to be recorded. Following the drummer's exit, fuzz reverse guitar, chimes, and abnormal bullfrog sounds were overdubbed onto the tracks. Following the completion of the album, Barkan's lawyer sent the tapes to Dick James, publisher of The Beatles. James made an offer for the rights to distribute the album, but the band declined on the assumption it would become a hit. Upon its October 1966 release, Psychedelic Moods failed to achieve the success the band anticipated. The lack of copies sold was, in part, due to the unforeseen success of Question Mark and the Mysterians' hit, \\"96 Tears\\", and Cameo-Parkway Records' poor circulation of the album. Over time, the album has garnered interest for being an early example of psychedelic music. In addition, despite the conflicting release dates, Psychedelic Moods is considered to have been the first album to have the word \\"psychedelic\\" in its title. A month after the album's distribution, The Blues Magoos, and The 13th Floor Elevators also released albums with the same phrase featured in the title. Collectables Records released the album in 1996 as a part of a series of outtakes, and previously unreleased material focusing on the Deep.

The film premiered theatrically in St. Louis, Missouri on June 13, 2014. The documentary chronicles the area of Spanish Lake, Missouri and its transformation from a 1950s white suburb to a mostly black population through a process known as white flight. The themes of the film parallel America‚Äôs growing political divide, underlying racism, and rise of anti-government sentiment. After strong ticket sales in St. Louis, the film received a limited release in Los Angeles and Dallas. Further theatrical expansion was halted in St. Louis in August 2014 after the shooting of Mike Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. Due to racial tensions in the city, Wehrenberg Theatres pulled the film from its planned release on September 5, 2014. The suppression of the film led to national media coverage, including an article by Deadline Hollywood. Spanish Lake was released to Video on demand on October 21, 2014 to critical acclaim. The DVD release came a month later on November 15, 2014. Background and development The idea for the project germinated from a visit director Phillip Andrew Morton took to his childhood home in Spanish Lake in September 2007. Finding the house abandoned as well as his school and church, he began to research the history of white flight in the St. Louis metropolitan area. Using his own money to launch the project, Spanish Lake began filming in April 2011 after Morton saw a Facebook event announcing the reunion of a group of former residents of Spanish Lake. Further funding for the film was found via a Kickstarter campaign in June 2011. Filming was wrapped in May 2013. Summary Spanish Lake was named after the Spanish troops who stayed there while building a fortified post for Spain in 1768. The first American military installation in the Louisiana Territory, Fort Bellefontaine, was built there after famed explorers Lewis &Clark; camped on the land at the start and end of their trip (1804‚Äì1806). Spanish Lake was a rural farming community for many years, until the 1950s when neighborhoods of tract housing were built. The area became a rural refuge from St. Louis city and received an exclusively white population. The 1970s saw the proliferation of dense apartment housing to Spanish Lake. African-Americans fleeing the failed Pruitt-Igoe public housing high rises in the city moved into the apartments via the Section 8 voucher system which immediately struck racial tensions in the area, particularly in local schools. The 1990s saw a mass exodus of the white population, spurred on by blockbusting, a practice some U.S. real estate agents use to encourage white property owners to sell their houses quickly at a loss, implying the African-Americans moving into their neighborhood will depress their property values. The film begins in 2011, when a group of former residents known as the ‚ÄúLakers‚Äù, revisit Spanish Lake for a reunion. Controversy Spanish Lake was quick to receive attention from the St. Louis media, as early as 2012 when many news stations announced its filming. The strong buzz surrounded the controversial subject matter of white flight, a topic that received little coverage due to its taboo nature. The trailer for the film was noticeably controversial as one interviewee states that some people would say: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have a problem with black people, it‚Äôs just niggers.‚Äù Two months after its release, Mike Brown was shot by police in Ferguson, a neighboring suburb only eight miles away from Spanish Lake. The controversy of the film, the proximity of the two areas, and the ensuing Ferguson riots led to Wehrenberg Theatres banning the film from their theaters in August 2014. The films‚Äô producer said to the Riverfront Times that the theater chain was ‚Äúafraid of showing a film that shines a spotlight on the issues underlying the issues that are happening in Ferguson‚Äù. Critical reception Spanish Lake received positive response from critics. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 80% of 5 film critics have given the film a positive review, with a rating average of 8.1 out of 10. A June 2014 Huffington Post review called Spanish Lake ‚Äúan honest film....and it isn‚Äôt always pretty.‚Äù Michael O‚ÄôSullivan of the Washington Post said ‚Äúit feels like a portrait of America‚Äù and ‚Äúit is likely that the racial tension in Spanish Lake shares a root system with what‚Äôs happening eight miles away in Ferguson.‚Äù A Village Voice review called the film ‚Äúrevelatory and urgently relevant‚Äù and ‚Äúcaptures something rarely seen on screen: The way many white people act just before they say something about race that they think maybe they shouldn‚Äôt.‚Äù Writer Peter Keough of The Boston Globe reviewed Spanish Lake as ‚Äúa thoughtful, even-handed account of the rise and fall of the title Missouri community.‚Äù Scott Mendelson of Forbes listed the film on his ‚ÄúGreat Films You Missed in 2014‚Äù. Soundtrack  The Hookman - ‚ÄúThis Is My Life‚Äù (music and lyrics by John Lechner) Legacy In May 2014, the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development hosted a screening of the film at their national headquarters in Washington, D.C. After the Ferguson riots, the film was screened by many prestigious schools such as Washington University. UCLA has used the film in their Urban Planning courses.

It is difficult to give one definition of Information Culture and many approaches exist. Overview The literature regarding Information Culture focuses on the relationship between individuals and information in their work. Curry and MooreCurry, A. and Moore, C. (2003). Assessing information culture - an exploratory model. International Journal of Information Management, Vol. 23 No. 2, pp. 91-110 are most frequently cited in the Information Culture literature, and there is consensus of that values accorded to information, and attitudes towards it are indicators of Information Culture (McMillan et al., 2012; Curry and Moore, 2003; Furness, 2010; Oliver, 2007; Davenport and Prusak, 1997; Wid√©n-Wulff, 2000; Jarvenpaa and Staples, 2001).Wright, T. (2013). Information culture in a government organization. Records Management Journal, 23(1), 14-36 Information Culture is a culture that is conducive to effective information management where \\"the value and utility of information in achieving operational and strategic goals is recognized, where information forms the basis of organizational decision making and Information Technology is readily exploited as an enabler for effective information systems\\". Information Culture is a part of the whole Organizational culture. It is only by understanding the organisation that progress can be made with information management activities.Oliver, G. (2011), Organizational Culture for Information Managers. Chandos Publishing thumb GinmanGinman, M. (1988). Information culture and business performance. IATUL Quarterly, 2(2), 93‚Äì106 defines Information Culture as the culture in which the transformation of intellectual resources is maintained alongside the transformation of material resources. Information Culture is the environment where knowledge is produced with social intelligence, social interaction and work knowledge. Multinational organizations (MNOs) are characterized by their engagement in global markets (Umanath & Campbell, 1994). In order to remain competitive in today's global marketplace.Guo, Zixiu, and John D‚ÄôAmbra. \\"The Influence Of National And Organizational Cultures On Technology Use\\". Journal of Global Information Management 17.4 (2009): 74-94. Web.http://www.igi- global.com/article/influence-national-organizational-cultures-technology/37216 In many organizations Information Culture is described as a form of Information Technology. As DavenportDavenport, T. H. (1994). Saving IT's Soul: Human-Centered Information Management. Harvard Business Review, 72(2), 119-131 writes, many executives think they solve all information problems with buying IT-equipment. Information Culture is about effective information management to use information, not machines, and Information Technology is just a part of Information Culture, which has an interactive role in it.Choo, C.W. (2013). Information culture and organizational effectiveness. International Journal of information management, 33, 775-779. Information Culture is the part of organizational culture where evaluation and attitudes towards information depend on the situation in which the organization works. In an organization everyone has different attitudes, but the information profile must be explained, so the importance of information should be realized by executives. The Information Culture is also about formal information systems (technology), common knowledge, individual information systems (attitudes), and information ethics.Cronin, B. and Davenport, E. (1993). Social Intelligence. Annual Review of Information Science and Technology (ARIST), 28, 3-44 Information Culture does not include written or conscious behavior and what seemingly happening in the organization. Information Culture is affected by the behaviors of internal factors of organization more than external factors, which comes in form of Information Culture, the attitudes and the traditions. Information Culture deals with information, information channels, the attitudes, the use and ability to forward or gather information with the environmental circumstances effectively. Knowledge base of any organization can be viewed according to Nonaka'sNonaka, I. (1994) A Dynamic Theory of Organisational Knowledge Creation. Organization Science, 5(1), 14-37 theories about the organizational knowledge production and Cronin & Davenport's theories about the social intelligence. According to these theories it is important to look at the organization Information Culture how the user uses the information. Cultural differences need to be understood before information technology developed for an organization in one country can be effectively implemented in an organization in another country.Leidner, Dorothy E et al. A Multicultural Perspective Of The Impact Of EIS On Organizational Intelligence, Decision Making And Structure. 1st ed. Fontainebleau: INSEAD, 1997.https://flora.insead.edu/fichiersti_wp/inseadwp1997/97-98.pdf A highly developed Information Culture leads the organization to success and work as a strategic goal that positively associated with organizational practices and performance. Choo et al.Choo, C. W., Bergeron, P., Detlor, B., & Heaton, L. (2008). Information culture and information use: An exploratory study of three organizations. Journal of the American Society for Information Science & Technology, 59(5), 792-804 looked at Information Culture as the socially shared patterns of behaviors, norms and values that define the significance and use of information in an organization. Also, scholars like Manuel Castells posits that the Information Culture transcends the confines of organizations and government participation through policies is relevant for achieving the norms and values.Castells, Manuel. The rise of the network society: The information age: Economy, society, and culture. Vol. 1. John Wiley & Sons, 2011. Norms are standards and values are beliefs and together they mold the information behavior as normal that are expected by the people in organization. In so far, information behavior is the reflection of cultural norms and values. Marchand, Kettinger and RollinsMarchand, D., Kettinger, W., & Rollins, J. (2001). Information orientation: The link to business performance. New York : Oxford University Press identifies six information behaviors and values to profile an organization's Information Culture: * Information integrity is defined as the use of information in a trustful and principled manner. * Information formality is the willingness to use and trust formal information over informal sources. * Information control is the extent to which information is used to manage and monitor performance. * Information transparency is the openness in reporting on errors and failures. * Information sharing is the willingness to provide others with information. * Proactiveness is actively using new information to innovate and respond quickly to changes. Information Culture typologies Based on a widely applied construct from Cameron and QuinnCameron, K. S., & Quinn, R. E. (2011). Diagnosing and changing organizational culture: Based on the competing values framework . Reading, MA : Jossey Bass that has been used to differentiate organizational culture types and their relationships to organizational effectiveness, Choo develops a typology of Information Culture. He emphasizes elements from information behavior research.Vick, T. E., Nagano, M. S., Popadiuk, S. (2015). Information culture and its influences in knowledge creation: Evidence from university teams engaged in collaborative innovation projects. International Journal of Information Management. 35(3), 292-298 The Information Culture typologies are characterized by a set of five attributes: # the primary goal of information management # information values and norms # information behaviors in terms of information needs # information seeking # information use In addition, Choo classifies Information Culture into four categories: Relationship-based Culture, Risk-taking Culture, Result-oriented Culture, and Rule-following Culture. Relationship-based Culture: information management supports communication, participation, and a sense of identity. Information values and norms emphasize sharing and the proactive use of information. These values promote collaboration and cooperation. The focus is on internal information. Risk-taking Culture: innovation, creativity, and the exploration of new ideas are encouraged while information is managed. Information values and norms emphasize sharing and the proactive use of information. These values promote innovation, development of new products or capabilities, and the boldness to take the initiative. The focus is on external information. Information is used to identify and evaluate opportunities, and promote entrepreneurial risk-taking. Result-oriented Culture: information management enables the organization to compete and succeed in its market or sector. Information values and norms call attention to control and integrity: accurate information is valued in order to assess performance and goal attainment. Information is used to understand clients and competitors, and to evaluate results. Rule-following Culture: information management reinforces the control of internal operations, rules and policies. Information values and norms emphasize control and standardized processes. The focus is on internal information. The organization seeks information about workflows, as well as information about regulatory or accountability requirements. Information is used to control operations, improve efficiency, and provide accountability. Information Culture in government organization Information governance is beginning to gain traction within organizations, particularly where compliance is a concern, and Davenport and Prusak's models of governance are useful tools to inform the design of information governance. Most public sector organizations in Canada have informal information governance models (or policies) Davenport, Eccles and PrusakDavenport, T.H., Eccles, R.G. and Prusak, L. (1992). Information politics. Sloan Management Review, Fall,53-65 have developed four models of information governance, to inform a progression of control. They describe the levels of information governance using political terms: information federalism, information feudalism, information monarchy, and information anarchy. Their observations allow to evaluate the effectiveness of their governance models in terms of information quality, efficiency, commonality, and access. Oliver's Oliver, G. (2011). Organizational Culture for Information Managers. Chandos Publishing research on three case study organizations found several factors that characterized and differentiated the Information Cultures were associated with the organizational information management framework, as well as attitudes and values accorded to information. Compliance requirements for the management of information have a significant place in shaping Information Culture. Research suggests that poor compliance to formal information governance policiesHoke, G.J. (2011). Records life cycle: a cradle-to-grave metaphor. Information Management Journal, 45(5), 28-32 reinforces the fact that sound knowledge and records management practices are often neglected. Information Culture affects support, enthusiasm and cooperation of staff and management of information, asserts Curry and Moore. If such an Information Culture is critical to the successful management of information assets, then it becomes vital to develop and nurture the commitment from both management and staff at all levels. Curry and Moore have developed an exploratory model of Information Culture, which included components needed within a strong Information Culture: effective communication flows, cross-organizational partnerships, co-operative working practices and open access to relevant information, management of information systems in accordance with business strategy, and clear guidelines and documentation for information and data management. Trust is a characteristic that has more recently come to the forefront in literature. The social dynamics between supervisors and workers relies upon trust, or the lack of trust, which will also have an effect on information sharing. Information Culture and Information Use Curry and Moore define Information Culture as \\"a culture in which the value and utility of information in achieving operational and strategic success is recognised, where information forms the basis of organizational decision making and information technology is readily exploited as an enabler for effective information systems\\". Information Culture is manifested in the organization's values, norms, and practices that affect how information is perceived, created and used.Choo, C.W. Information management for the intelligent organization: the art of scanning the environment. 3rd ed. Medford, NJ: Information Today, Inc., 2002. xx, 325 p. . The six information behaviors and values identified by Marchand to characterize the Information Culture of an organization are information integrity, formality, control, sharing, transparency, and proactiveness. A part of culture that deals specifically with information ‚Äîthe perceptions, values, and norms that people have about creating, sharing, and applying information‚Äî has a significant effect on information use outcomes. It is possible to systematically identify behaviors and values that describe an organization's Information Culture. It is possible to systematically identify behaviours and values that characterize an organization's Information Culture, and that this characterization could be helpful in understanding the information use effectiveness of all sorts of organizations, including private businesses, government agencies, and publicly funded institutions such as libraries and museums. A study by Choo and others suggested that organizations might do well to remember that in the rush to implement strategies and systems, information values and information culture will always have a defining influence on how people share and use information.Choo, C. W., Furness, C., Paquette, S., van den Berg, H., Detlor, B., Bergeron, P. et al., (2006). Working with information: Information management and culture in a professional services organization. Journal of Information Science, 32(6), 491‚Äì510. Information Culture and Organizational Culture In industrialised countries, most of the diseases and injuries are related to mental health problems and are the main reason of employees absenteeism. There are number of risk factors or stressors that may cause psychological strain and ill health, resulted in occupational stress interventions that occur in isolation, independent of organizational culture. Paying more attention to organizational culture paves the way for a contextualized analysis of stress and distress in the workplace. An integrated framework is used in which the association between organizational culture and mental health is mediated by the work organization conditions that qualify the task environment like information management, information sharing and decision making. Organizational cultures somehow intertwined with the Information Culture. Information Culture is a part of Organizational Culture as values, behaviour of employees in the organisation somehow effect the Information Culture. The framework links organizational culture to mental health via work organization conditions and is inscribed within the functionalist perspective that views culture as an organizational construct that influences and shapes organizational characteristics.O‚ÄôReilly, C. A., & Chatman, J. A. (1996) (Sorensen, 2002). Culture as social control: Corporations, cults and commitment. Research in Organizational Behavior, 18, 157‚Äì200 Organizational culture is conceptualized in terms of the four quadrants of the Quinn and RohrbaughQuinn, R. E., & Rohrbaugh, J. (1983). A spatial model of effectiveness criteria: Towards a competing values approach to organizational analysis. Management Science, 29, 363‚Äì377 typology. Which are Group Culture, Developmental Culture, Hierarchical Culture and Rational Culture and by knowing these cultures organisations can easily adopt the relevant culture according to their work related conditions. Although work organization conditions and organizational culture are closely intertwined, they should not be confounded (Detert, Schroeder, & Mauriel;Detert, J. R., Schroeder, R. G., & Mauriel, J. J. (2000). A framework for linking culture and improvement initiatives in organizations. Academy of Management Review, 25, 850‚Äì863 Schein;Schein, E. H. (2004). Organizational culture and leadership (3rd ed.). San Francisco, CA : Jossey-Bass Witte & Muijen, 1999). Just as societal cultural values would influence organizationally relevant outcomes (Taras, Kirkman, & Steel, 2010), organizational culture might influence work organization conditions. Schein views organizational culture as a multilayered construct that includes artifacts, values, social ideals, and basic assumptions. Artifacts such as behaviors, structures, processes, and technology form a first layer. At a more latent level, organizational culture is noticed in the values and social ideals shared by members of the organization (i.e., ideology of the organization). These values and ideals are revealed in symbolic mechanisms such as myths, rituals, stories, legends, and a codified language, as well as in corporate objectives, strategies, management philosophies, and in the justifications given for these. Group Culture encourages employees to make suggestions regarding how to improve their own work and overall performance. As a result, the group culture creates an empowering environment in which individuals perceive they have autonomy and influence. Consequently, in the Group Culture, individuals recognize that their work has meaning and that they have the skills to carry it out. Considering also that information sharing is an important feature of employee participation, informational support from leaders is likely to be high in the group culture. Group Culture tends to develop task designs that promote the use of skills and decision authority, which are protective factors and also implement work organization conditions that promote social support whether from colleagues or from supervisors, which thereby have a beneficial influence on employee mental health. Developmental Culture is helpful to develop decentralised work design that promotes the use of skills and decision authority with benefit to employee mental health. In Developmental Culture, employees are likely to enjoy significant rewards that could have beneficial effects on employee mental health. Hierarchical Culture is helpful to promote social support and thereby play a beneficial role in employee mental health. In this type of culture, it could well be seniority that determines both compensation and career advancement, giving employees a certain level of job security that could prove beneficial for employee mental health. Rational Culture with clear performance indicators and measurements is likely to minimize conflicting demands that could be beneficial for employee mental health.So these integrated model can help the organisations and the managers to choose the suitable culture. Integration of organizational culture into occupational stress models is a fruitful avenue to achieve a deeper understanding of occupational mental health problems in the workplace and this framework can also helpful to serve as a starting point for multilevel occupational stress research.

The Finding of Moses is a 1904 painting by the Anglo-Dutch artist Lawrence Alma-Tadema. It was one of his last major works before his death in 1912, but quickly fell out of favour; according to rumour, it was sold in the 1950s for its frame. After appreciation of Victorian painting was renewed towards the end of the 20th century, it was described in an auction catalogue in 1995 as \\"the undisputed masterpiece of [Alma-Tadema's] last decade, as well as a late (perhaps the final?) flowering of the nineteenth-century's love-affair with Egypt\\". It was sold to a private collector at auction in 2010 for nearly US$36 million. The Finding of Moses had been a popular subject for paintings since the Renaissance, with a revival in the 19th century by Orientalist artists keen to add authentic archaeological decor to their depictions. Background The painting was commissioned by Sir John Aird, 1st Baronet for 5,000 guineas, plus expenses. Aird's civil engineering business, John Aird & Co., was responsible for building the first Aswan Dam. Aird invited Alma-Tadema to visit Egypt for the opening of the dam in December 1902, and commissioned him to paint a suitable subject to add to Aird's large collection of academic paintings by the likes of Frederic Leighton, Edward Poynter, and John William Waterhouse, including Alma-Tadema's 1888 work The Roses of Heliogabalus. The commission allowed Alma-Tadema to revisit Egyptian themes from his works in the 1860s. Description The work is a Biblical scene based on chapter 2, verse 6 of the Book of Exodus, in which Pharaoh's daughter comes to wash in the River Nile, and finds the infant Moses abandoned in a basket in the reeds. The painting depicts the scene after the infant has been discovered, showing a procession travelling back to the daughter's abode in Memphis, the capital of the Old Kingdom of Egypt. The Finding of Moses had been a popular scene for painters, especially since the Late Renaissance. Shaven-headed male attendant in white loincloths carry Pharaoh's daughter in an elaborately decorated chair. She wears a pink diaphanous gown and elaborate jewellery, and holds a flail in her left hand, a symbol of royalty; in her right hand, she holds a lotus flower. The style and decoration of her chair is informed by illustrations of Egyptian tomb paintings. Her feet rest on a footstool decorated with bound captives -- another symbol of royalty -- and also referring to the enslaved Israelites. Hieroglyphic cartouches identify her as the daughter of Ramesses II. It has been claimed that one of Alma-Tadema's daughters sat as the model for Pharaoh's daughter. Two male attendants wave ostrich feather fans, while two female attendants carry Moses in his cradle alongside. The cradle has been decorated with lotus flowers, tied on with a pink ribbon. Another female attendant plays a stringed instrument. The painting is composed like a frieze, with bright blues and purples of delphiniums in the foregrounds; the procession passing behind; a space for the river; and then, in the background, on the other bank of the river, teams of slaves can be seen labouring under their dark-skinned overseers, possibly working on the pyramids at Giza on the opposite bank. The blues of the flowers are echoed by the lapis lazuli inlay of the chair, but contrast with yellows, oranges, reds and pinks. The plinth and feet of a red granite statue are just visible to the front left, possibly copied from a statue of Seti II in the British Museum. The plinth bears more hieroglyphics, reading \\"Beloved of Ra, King of Upper and Lower Egypt,\\" Reception Alma-Tadema worked on the painting for two years. King Edward VII visited Alma-Tadema in his studio while the work was being completed. By the time it was finished, his wife wryly quipped that the infant Moses would now be \\"two years old, and need no longer be carried\\". The painting was exhibited at the Royal Academy summer exhibition in 1905; the same year, Alma-Tadema became one of the first 18 members of the Order of Merit. The work was received with warm but not enthusiastic praise. Alma-Tadema's works fell dramatically out of favour after his death in 1912, but provided inspiration for the set designers of Biblical epics such as D. W. Griffith's Intolerance (1916), and Cecil B. DeMille's Cleopatra (1934) and The Ten Commandments (1956) (in 1968 Mario Amaya published an article in The Sunday Times entitled \\"The Painter who Inspired Hollywood\\"). After Aird's death in 1911, the painting was inherited by his son Sir John Richard Aird, 2nd Baronet, and then following his death in 1934 it was sold by his son Sir John Renton Aird, 3rd Baronet at Christie's in London in May 1935, and acquired by an art dealer for 820 guineas. The painting was sold to Sir Jeremiah Colman, 1st Baronet, and then after his death in January 1942 it was auctioned at Christie's in September 1942, acquired by a different dealer for 260 guineas. It was sold to F. W. Reeves of Wolverhampton, and then sold at a country auction in September 1950, and acquired by London dealer Newman. In a widely reported, but probably apocryphal, story, the painting was reputedly sold to an English couple for a small sum. They had no interest in the unfashionable painting, buying the work for the frame, by Thomas Maw: after leaving the dealers, they removed the painting from its frame, and the artwork was found minutes later abandoned in an alley in St James's near the gallery. Bernard Hart, a director of Newman's at the time, wrote to The Times to dispute the story: in his account, more prosaically, the gallery failed to find a museum willing to take the picture, even as a gift, and it remained unsold when sent to Christie's by Newman's in December 1960. It was \\"bought in\\" by the auction house, and eventually acquired to decorate the walls of the Clock House Restaurant near Welwyn in Hertfordshire. The painting was sold to the London art dealers in July 1967, and sold on to Ira Spanierman Galleries in New York shortly afterwards for $8,500; in turn, they sold it on to Allen Funt for $25,000. Funt was the producer of Candid Camera, and a collector of Alma-Tadema's at a time when his works remained deeply unfashionable. The painting was included in an exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York in March and April 1973, entitled \\"Victorians in Togas\\". After Funt experienced financial troubles, he sold the painting along with the rest of his collection at Sotheby's in London in November 1973, for around $72,000. Reportedly, he kept the original frames and put in photos of the paintings that he had sold. The painting was bought by a private collector, and then sold to another private collector at Christie's in New York in May 1995 for US$2,752,500, before being sold again at Sotheby's for US$35,922,500 (including buyer's premium) in November 2010.

The spring was named for Chief Crawfish of the Cherokee. History Native Americans After the period of the Mississippian mound builders, the area around Crawfish Spring passed into control of the Cherokee. Under pressure from the encroachment of white settlers, around 1800, the Cherokee nation divided into eight districts, one of which was the Chickamauga District, which included Crawfish Spring. According to Frederick Ufford, director of the Walker County Regional Heritage Museum and Civil War Center in Chickamauga, \\"Any place where there are large springs, generally there were populations of American Indians because of the water source\\". The Cherokee constructed their courthouse for the Chickamuaga District on a spot adjacent to Crawfish Spring. White settlement Shortly after the forced removal of the Cherokee from their ancestral lands in Georgia, in 1840 white settler James Gordon built a plantation and constructed a two-story brick house, now known as the Gordon-Lee Mansion, adjacent to Crawfish Spring. The house was built on the site of the old Cherokee courthouse. Civil War With the outbreak of the American Civil War James Gordon's son, Clark Gordon stood upon a rock beside the Gordon-Lee Mansion and organized 2nd Company D, First Georgia Volunteer Infantry, C.S.A. On September 16, 1863, two days preceding the Battle of Chickamauga, Union Major General William S. Rosecrans commandeered the house and surrounding property for use as his headquarters during the battle. The spring became the primary water source for troops under Rosecrans' command. One of his staff officers, Col. John P. Sanderson, wrote in his diary that \\"the spring here is a magnificent one, affording an abundant supply for man and beast of the entire army, of cool, soft, and delicious water\\". A member of the 37th Indiana Infantry Regiment was also impressed by the spring. George H. Putney wrote \\"After going some distance, we came to Crawfish Springs. There we were permitted to fill our canteens, which we gladly did, as we knew the importance of water in a bottle. What a beautiful spring of water that was and is! Think of going from that pure life-giving fountain of clear, cold water, springing up in great abundance, to a great and dreadful battle where smoke and dust and toil and wounds and death hold high carnival. That is war!\\" The 39th Indiana Mounted Infantry encamped at the spring during the battle, which precipitated the establishment of the federal army's major field hospital and medical supply depot there. After the start of battle, wounded filled the Gordon house and large tents that were erected on the grounds. When the number of wounded Union soldiers overwhelmed those facilities, the wounded were laid out in rows on the ground, with lines of campfires at their feet. On September 20, 1863, cavalry under the command of Confederate Major General Joseph Wheeler swept through the area, capturing the hospital and large quantities of medical supplies, in addition to 1,000 wounded Union soldiers. Twenty-six years after the Battle of Chickamauga, on September 20, 1889, General Rosecrans returned to Crawfish Spring, where he was greeted by Confederate Major General John B. Gordon (then governor of the state of Georgia) in a reunion of former foes \\"in the spirit of reconciliation and friendship\\". The reunion was attended by 14,000 veterans from both sides of the conflict and was known as the Blue and Gray Barbecue. The event prompted President Benjamin Harrison to designate the Chickamauga battlefield as America's first Military Park. Water supply and recreational area Until 1888, the area and post office of Chickamauga was known as Crawfish Spring. The spring was the primary water supply for settlers and for the city itself. When the city converted to another water source, Crawfish Spring became a recreational area. Geology Crawfish Spring is estimated to flow at a rate of approximately , emanating from the base of a small dolomite hill. It is along the contact of the Chickamauga Limestone and Knox Dolomite. The Knox Dolomite forms Missionary Ridge to the west of the spring, and it is this chert ridge that acts as the catchment area for the water flowing from the spring.

For example, a patient with deficits in social skills may learn and rehearse proper social skills in one treatment session, then be asked to complete homework assignments before the next session that apply those newly learned skills (e.g., going to a social engagement or greeting five people each day).Falloon, I. R., Lindley, P., McDonald, R., & Marks, I. M. (1977). Social skills training of out-patient groups. A controlled study of rehearsal and homework. The British Journal of Psychiatry, 131(6), 599‚Äì609. Homework is most often used in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for the treatment of mood and anxiety disorders, although other theoretical frameworks may also incorporate homework.Kazantzis, N., Deane, F. P., & Ronan, K. R. (2000). Homework assignments in cognitive and behavioral therapy: A meta‚Äêanalysis. Clinical Psychology: Science and Practice, 7(2), 189‚Äì202.Bowen, S., Chawla, N., Collins, S.

Some of the types of homework used in CBT include thought records and behavioral experiments.Bennett-Levy, J. (2003). Mechanisms of change in cognitive therapy: The case of automatic thought records and behavioural experiments. Behavioural and Cognitive Psychotherapy, 31(03), 261‚Äì277. Patients using thought records are instructed to write down negative cognitions on the thought record form and weigh the evidence both for and against the negative thoughts, with the goal being to come up with new, balanced thoughts in the process. Behavioral experiments are used as homework to help patients test out thoughts and beliefs directly. Studies have shown that homework completion and accuracy predict favorable outcomes in psychotherapy and may help patients stay in remission.Burns, D. D., & Auerbach, A. H. (1992). Does homework compliance enhance recovery from depression? Psychiatric Annals.Kazantzis, N., Whittington, C., & Dattilio, F. (2010). Meta‚Äêanalysis of homework effects in cognitive and behavioral therapy: A replication and extension. Clinical Psychology: Science and Practice, 17(2), 144‚Äì156. However, some therapists are concerned that assigning homework makes therapy too formal and reduces the impact of the individual sessions.Kazantzis, N., Lampropoulos, G. K., & Deane, F. P. (2005). A national survey of practicing psychologists' use and attitudes toward homework in psychotherapy. Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 73(4), 742. Approaches Most of the literature published on homework in psychotherapy to date focuses on homework use during CBT, which involves changing patients' thoughts and behaviors to reduce the symptoms of the mental disorders from which they are suffering.Blagys, M. D., & Hilsenroth, M. J. (2002). Distinctive activities of cognitive‚Äìbehavioral therapy: A review of the comparative psychotherapy process literature. Clinical Psychology Review, 22(5), 671‚Äì706. A variety of homework assignments exist in CBT.Thase, M. E., & Callan, J. A. (2006). The role of homework in cognitive behavior therapy of depression. Journal of Psychotherapy Integration, 16(2), 162. These tasks can range from scheduling a daily exercise routine to practicing progressive muscle relaxation five times a day to monitoring and recording one's negative automatic thoughts throughout the day. In practice, these homework assignments are meant to help patients lift their mood, practice and master skills they developed in therapy, and progressively improve between treatment sessions. Research has found that homework compliance positively predicts successful outcomes in therapy, and therapists are now looking for better ways to implement homework, so that more individuals may receive its benefits. CBT is not the only type of therapy to incorporate homework. Although each therapist makes his or her own choices regarding homework assignments, some of the other therapies that may assign homework include exposure therapy, psychodynamic therapy, and problem solving therapy.Malouff, J. M., Thorsteinsson, E. B., & Schutte, N. S. (2007). The efficacy of problem solving therapy in reducing mental and physical health problems: A meta-analysis. Clinical Psychology Review, 27(1), 46‚Äì57.Al-Kubaisy, T., Marks, I. M., Logsdail, S., Marks, M. P., Lovell, K., Sungur, M., & Araya, R. (1992). Role of exposure homework in phobia reduction: A controlled study. Behavior Therapy, 23(4), 599‚Äì621. Homework can also be assigned even if therapists are not physically present with the patients being treated. Such cases include therapy delivered over the phone, over video, or over the Internet.Carlbring, P., Bohman, S., Brunt, S., Buhrman, M., Westling, B. E., Ekselius, L., & Andersson, G. (2006). Remote treatment of panic disorder: a randomized trial of internet-based cognitive behavior therapy supplemented with telephone calls.

Internet treatment for depression: a randomized controlled trial comparing clinician vs. technician assistance. PLoS ONE, 5(6), e10939. Treatment of some disorders, such as major depression, may also be done without therapists at all.Vernmark, K., Lenndin, J., Bj√§rehed, J., Carlsson, M., Karlsson, J., √ñberg, J., ... & Andersson, G. (2010). Internet administered guided self-help versus individualized e-mail therapy: A randomized trial of two versions of CBT for major depression. Behaviour Research and Therapy, 48(5), 368‚Äì376. Although the efficacy of this self-help-like treatment is still under scrutiny, preliminary data suggest that completion of homework is one factor predicting positive treatment outcomes for patients who receive treatment over the Internet.de Graaf, L. E., Huibers, M. J., Riper, H., Gerhards, S. A., & Arntz, A. (2009). Use and acceptability of unsupported online computerized cognitive behavioral therapy for depression and associations with clinical outcome. Journal of Affective Disorders, 116(3), 227‚Äì231. Thought records Thought records (or thought diaries) are among the most commonly used cognitive assignments in CBT.Greenberger, D., & Padesky, C. A. (1995). Mind over Mood: Change How You feel by Changing the Way You Think. Guilford Press. They allow patients in various situations to closely examine \\"hot thoughts\\" and cognitive distortions and, after having done so, arrive at a newly synthesized alternative thought that more closely fits the situation. Many thought records accomplish this task by having patients list out in order: the situation they are in; the emotions they are feeling and with what intensity those emotions are felt; what thoughts they are having and what the \\"hot thought\\" is; evidence for the hot thought; evidence against the \\"hot thought\\"; balanced alternative thoughts; and the emotions they feel after having completed the thought record and the intensity of those emotions. Example Jane has social anxiety disorder and was just told at work that she would be giving a presentation in front of an audience of 200 people the following week. This produces a large amount of anxiety for Jane, and she starts filling out a thought record to try to calm herself down. To begin, she fills in the column about the situation she is in with: \\"I was told that I am going to give a speech in front of a large audience next week.\\" In the next column, Jane writes what emotions she is feeling and with what intensity she is feeling them: \\"Anxious ‚Äì 100. Afraid ‚Äì 90. Sad ‚Äì 40.\\" She then starts identifying some thoughts that immediately ran through her head when she heard that she would be giving the presentation: \\"Oh no, I'm going to mess up and choke. Everyone will laugh at me. My boss will fire me. I will never be able to hold a job at this rate. I'm worthless and a failure.\\" Jane identifies \\"I'm worthless and a failure\\" as the hot thought, the thought that invokes the greatest amount of negative emotion in her situation. After that, Jane starts writing in the next column the pieces of evidence that support the hot thought: \\"I've done terribly on presentations in the past. I remember one time in high school when I had to give a speech in front of my class and I ended up crying in front of everyone instead. I got a C on that speech and barely scraped by in the class. My high school friends and I don't talk as much anymore. They must be starting to get sick of me too. My co-workers don't try to talk to me either.\\" Jane jots down in the next column pieces of evidence against her hot thought: \\"I think my boss might have meant well when he gave me this presentation assignment. I did one of these presentations on a smaller scale last week and I think I did just fine. Almost everyone who was there even came up to me and told me so afterwards. I think that those audience members do care about me and would be willing to support me if I asked. Also, I'm filling out this thought record just like my therapist told me to. I think that's what she would have wanted from me.\\" In the next column, Jane writes down her alternative thought: \\"The presentation ahead may be scary and making me feel anxious, but I think I can handle it as long as I know that there are people who support me.\\" After that, Jane writes the emotions she is now feeling and their intensities: \\"Anxious ‚Äì 50. Afraid ‚Äì 40. Sad ‚Äì 10. Relieved ‚Äì 50.\\" Efficacy Both the quality and quantity of thought records completed during therapy have been found to be predictive of treatment outcomes for patients with depression and/or an anxiety disorder.Mausbach, B. T., Moore, R., Roesch, S., Cardenas, V., & Patterson, T. L. (2010). The relationship between homework compliance and therapy outcomes: An updated meta-analysis. Cognitive Therapy and Research, 34(5), 429‚Äì438. Furthermore, Rees, McEvoy, & Nathan (2005) found that accuracy ratings of patients' thought records mid-treatment was positively correlated with post- treatment outcomes, and that doing homework in CBT was overall preferable to not doing homework in CBT.Rees, C. S., McEvoy, P., & Nathan, P. R. (2005). Relationship between homework completion and outcome in cognitive behaviour therapy. Cognitive Behaviour Therapy, 34(4), 242‚Äì247. Completing thought records accurately may also be indicative of overall skill gain in treatment; Neimeyer and Feixas (1990) found that patients with depression who completed thought records accurately were less likely to relapse six months after treatment termination.Neimeyer, R. A., & Feixas, G. (1990). The role of homework and skill acquisition in the outcome of group cognitive therapy for depression. Behavior Therapy, 21(3), 281‚Äì292. The researchers hypothesized that this was because the patients who completed thought records accurately had acquired the skills taught in CBT, and that these skills served as valuable coping strategies when the patients were faced with future stressors and needed to act as their own therapists. Behavioral experiments Behavioral experiments are collaborative endeavors in which therapists and patients work together to identify a potentially negative or harmful belief, then to either confirm or disprove it by designing an experiment that tests the belief. Like thought records, they are most often used in CBT. Example Patients with panic disorder tend to interpret normal bodily sensations as signs of impending catastrophe.Clark, D. M., Salkovskis, P. M., √ñst, L. G., Breitholtz, E., Koehler, K. A., Westling, B. E., ... & Gelder, M. (1997). Misinterpretation of body sensations in panic disorder. Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 65(2), 203. An individual with panic disorder may then believe that hyperventilation is a sign of an upcoming heart attack. A therapist who identifies this maladaptive thought can then work with the patient to test the belief with a behavioral experiment. To begin, the therapist and the patient would agree on a thought to test. In this case, it might be something like, \\"When I start hyperventilating, I will have a heart attack.\\" Then, the therapist may start giving suggestions on how to test the belief. She may suggest, \\"Why don't you try hyperventilating? If you show signs of having a heart attack, I have training in CPR and I'll be able to help you while waiting for the authorities.\\" After some initial apprehension, the patient may agree with the experiment and start breathing in a hyperventilating pattern while the therapist watches. Since the patient with panic disorder most likely will not have a heart attack while hyperventilating, he will be less likely to believe in the original thought, even though he may have been scared of testing the belief at first. Efficacy Relative to thought records, behavioral experiments are thought to be better at changing an individual's beliefs and behaviors. To test this hypothesis, researchers conducted an experiment comparing the degree of belief and behavioral change in participants who were given either a thought record or a behavioral experiment intervention. Specifically, this study tested participants who endorsed the commonly held belief, \\"If I don't wash my hands after going to the restroom, I'll get sick.\\"McManus, F., Van Doorn, K., & Yiend, J. (2012). Examining the effects of thought records and behavioral experiments in instigating belief change. Journal of behavior therapy and experimental psychiatry, 43(1), 540‚Äì547. Participants in the thought record condition were given a \\"normal\\" thought record not unlike the one described in the \\"Thought Record\\" section of this article and asked to come up with evidence for and against the following belief: \\"Not washing your hands after going to the toilet will make you ill.\\" After this, they were asked to reflect on their own experiences of washing or not washing their hands after going to the toilet and to come up with a balanced alternative belief. In the behavioral experiment condition, participants worked with the experimenter to come up with a study to test the validity of the same belief used in the thought record condition. For example, one study could involve having the participant void without washing her hands afterwards to see if she would become ill. The participant was encouraged to concretely define how she would tell whether she became ill or not (e.g., check for fever, coughing, aches, or other common symptoms of illness) and to test her belief as thoroughly as possible (e.g., if the participant believed she was more likely to get ill after touching the toilet seat and not washing her hands, she was encouraged to test this hypothesis as well). The researchers found that, compared to a no-treatment control, both thought records and behavioral experiments were effective in reducing the belief that not washing one's hands after going to the toilet would make oneself ill. However, behavioral experiments were found to be able to change the individuals' beliefs immediately following the intervention, while thought records demonstrated this ability to change belief only at follow-up one week after the intervention. On the other hand, the researchers found that neither thought records nor behavioral experiments were effective at reducing how often individuals actually washed their hands after using the toilet, even if they no longer believed that they would become ill for not washing their hands. Since the sample being studied was drawn from a normal population (as opposed to the population of individuals seeking treatment for psychological disorders), this lack of an effect on behavior may be due to the possibility that the people being studied were not under any motivation to actually change their behavior. Problems and uncertainties Homework is generally associated with improved patient outcomes, but it is still uncertain what other factors may moderate or mediate the effects that homework has on how much patients improve. That is, some researchers have hypothesized that patients who are more motivated to complete homework are also more likely to improve; other researchers have suggested that only individuals with less severe psychopathologies are even capable of completing homework, so it would be effective only for a subset of individuals.Keijsers, G. P. J., Schaap, C. P. D. R., & Hoogduin, C. A. L. (2000). The Impact of Interpersonal Patient and Therapist Behavior on Outcome in Cognitive-Behavior Therapy A Review of Empirical Studies. Behavior Modification, 24(2), 264‚Äì297. To test these possibilities, Burns and Spengler (2000) used structural equation modeling to estimate the causal relations between homework compliance and depressive symptomatology before and after psychotherapy. These researchers found that \\"the data were consistent with the hypothesis that HW compliance had a causal effect on changes in depression, and the magnitude of this effect was large\\" (p. 46).Burns, D. D., & Spangler, D. L. (2000). Does psychotherapy homework lead to improvements in depression in cognitive‚Äìbehavioral therapy or does improvement lead to increased homework compliance? Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 68(1), 46. Still, there may exist factors that improve homework compliance during therapy, such as general therapist competency and therapists' reviewing homework completed since the previous session.Bryant, M. J., Simons, A. D., & Thase, M. E. (1999). Therapist skill and patient variables in homework compliance: Controlling an uncontrolled variable in cognitive therapy outcome research. Cognitive Therapy and Research, 23(4), 381‚Äì399. The types of homework used in psychotherapy are not limited to thought records and behavioral experiments, which tend to be relatively structured in their implementation. In fact, even though researchers have found that psychotherapy with homework is generally more effective than psychotherapy without homework, there have not been many efforts to research if specific types of homework are better at effecting positive treatment outcomes than others, or if certain environments help promote the positive effects of homework. For example, Helbig-Lang and colleagues found that, in an environment where systematic homework assignment procedures were rare but where overall homework compliance remained high, homework compliance was not positively related to treatment outcomes.Helbig- Lang, S., Hagestedt, D., Lang, T., & Petermann, F. (2012). Therapeutische Hausaufgaben in der klinischen Praxis: Einsatz, Erledigung und Beziehungen zum Therapieverlauf. Zeitschrift f√ºr Psychiatrie, Psychologie und Psychotherapie, 60(2), 111‚Äì119. Another group of researchers looked at patients with depression who were in remission and undergoing maintenance therapy and found that homework compliance did not correlate with treatment outcomes in this sample, either.Weck, F., Richtberg, S., Esch, S., H√∂fling, V., & Stangier, U. (2013). The relationship between therapist competence and homework compliance in maintenance cognitive therapy for recurrent depression: Secondary analysis of a randomized trial. Behavior Therapy, 44(1), 162‚Äì172. More research can help elucidate the relations among the types of homework used in psychotherapy, the environments in which they are incorporated, and treatment outcomes for patients with the various disorders for which the homework is being assigned. Future directions Both clinicians and patients encounter difficulties in incorporating and complying to homework procedures throughout a treatment.Kazantzis, N., & Deane, F. P. (1999). Psychologists' use of homework assignments in clinical practice. Professional Psychology: Research and Practice, 30(6), 581.Helbig, S., & Fehm, L. (2004). Problems with homework in CBT: Rare exception or rather frequent?. Behavioural and cognitive psychotherapy, 32(03), 291‚Äì301. Factors that have been found to be associated with homework compliance during treatment include having the therapist set concrete goals for completing the homework and involving the patient in discussions surrounding the assigned homework.Detweiler-Bedell, J. B., & Whisman, M. A. (2005). A Lesson in Assigning Homework: Therapist, Client, and Task Characteristics in Cognitive Therapy for Depression. Professional Psychology: Research and Practice, 36(2), 219. If homework compliance is as important to treatment outcomes as most research suggest, however, then there is room for improvement and future studies could focus on how to improve compliance more effectively.Detweiler, J. B., & Whisman, M. A. (1999). The role of homework assignments in cognitive therapy for depression: Potential methods for enhancing adherence. Clinical Psychology: Science and Practice, 6(3), 267‚Äì282. Like the psychotherapies in which they are incorporated, homework may not be effective at helping all people with all different kinds of psychological disorders.Norcross, J. C., & Wampold, B. E. (2011). What works for whom: Tailoring psychotherapy to the person. Journal of Clinical Psychology, 67(2), 127‚Äì132. It is thus important to research for which disorders and in which general situations homework would enhance a therapy. This would ostensibly help patients being treated for psychological disorders receive more individualized care and support, and hopefully improve overall treatment outcomes for all disorders.Kazdin, A. E. (2008). Evidence-based treatment and practice: new opportunities to bridge clinical research and practice, enhance the knowledge base, and improve patient care. American Psychologist, 63(3), 146. An example of a specific situation in which homework may be helpful is the mitigation of safety-seeking behaviors with behavioral experiments. Safety seeking behaviors are undertaken by individuals to prevent anticipated future catastrophes, but may end up being more harmful for these individuals in the long run. For example, a patient with panic disorder may avoid exercising because he believes that breathing heavily will make him have a panic attack. Because of the apparently preventative function of safety seeking behaviors, people who carry out these behaviors are unlikely to test their actual effectiveness in preventing catastrophes. So, designing behavioral experiments in therapy to test these behaviors could potentially be a helpful means for reducing their occurrence.Salkovskis, P. M., Clark, D. M., Hackmann, A., Wells, A., & Gelder, M. G. (1999). An experimental investigation of the role of safety-seeking behaviours in the maintenance of panic disorder with agoraphobia.

Tradition holds that during 1584, the painting had miraculously emitted light. They initiated construction of the sanctuary using a design by Giovanni Battista Guerra, a lay oratorian. A prior, more elaborate design by Ludovico Carducci and funded in 1585 by the Duke of Urbino Francesco Maria II was abandoned. By 1601, after an onslaught of the plague, the Filippini left the sanctuary to the Barnabites to complete. This latter order was suppressed in 1861 and the sanctuary passed into the custody of the Cistercian order. The sanctuary has a modified Greek Cross design with three rounded lobes (apse and tribune arms) and a flat fa√ßade. Along the nave from the entrance are two chapels on each side. On the first chapel on the right is an altarpiece of the Blessed Alessandro Sauli presented by Angels to San Carlo Borromeo attributed to Felice Torelli.

He made a metal sculpture of a Tyrannosaurus rex for his daughter Lianna after she asked for a dinosaur for Christmas following a viewing of Jurassic Park III. He continued work on sculptures, and was eventually discovered by a philanthropist named Dennis Avery who paid him to construct one piece that then resulted in more than 100 sculptures on his property at Galleta Meadows Estate based on beasts found in a book he funded that depicts now-fossilized creatures in the Anza Borrego Desert as well as mythological creatures. Notable statues made by Breceda include a stagecoach pulled by horses, a large serpent, and a Tyrannosaurus rex. Breceda was the subject of a book called \\"Ricardo Breceda: Accidental Artist\\", and his art was cited by both The Huffington Post and The San Diego Union-Tribune as reasons why people should visit the Anza-Borrego Desert. You can visit his outdoor studio location known for its rustic charm and open landscape; in Aguanga, which allows the structures to be a part of the surrounding outdoor landscape with hilltop views and winding country roads. It‚Äôs acsesible to everyone as a vibrant public space that exists to exhibit and purchase, as well as giving intriguing experiences that engage the senses, activate the imagination, and provide connections between the viewer and collection of free-standing metal statues and kinetic sculptures‚Äîfrom garden-sized to monumental‚Äîdisplayed throughout the beautiful grounds at 44450 Highway 79 S. Aguanga, California.  Early life  Ricardo Breceda was born in Durango, Mexico. He is a single parent to his daughter. He later moved to Borrego Springs, California.  Career  This Sea Serpent sculpture is one of Breceda's most famous and largest works. Breceda worked as a cowboy boots salesman in Durango, among other professions. He also worked as a construction worker, but suffered a construction accident and was injured. What caused him to do these statues was that he brought his then 6-year-old daughter to see the film Jurassic Park III in 2001. After the movie, he asked his daughter what she wanted for Christmas, and she replied that she wanted a dinosaur. A few weeks later, Breceda made his first metal statue, which was a 20-foot tall, 45-foot long Tyrannosaurus rex, for his daughter. This led to him making more of these statues as a hobby, and eventually people began to show interest and offered to purchase some of his statues. In 2007, a philanthropist named Dennis Avery drove by his studio, then located in Riverside County in Perris, California. Avery asked Breceda to create statues on his property based on beasts featured in a book he financed about now-fossilized creatures once found in the Anza-Borrego Desert. Avery continued to request that Breceda create more of the beasts found in the book until he ran out of animals for Breceda to recreate. Once this happened, Breceda began work on statues based on mythical creatures. When Avery died in 2012, a fund was established to ensure that if storms or vandals damaged his statues, he would be able to repair them. By the time Avery had died, Breceda had finished 130 of the sculptures requested of him by Avery. The sculptures contributed to an increase in economic prosperity in Borrego Springs, which suffered from the Great Recession. He eventually moved to Borrego Springs. His metal works studio is found in the Vail Lake Resort RV Park in the Anza Borrego Desert in Temecula, California. How Breceda became involved in making metal statues caused him to be called \\"The Accidental Artist.\\" as well as \\"the Picasso of Steel\\". His sculptures generally sell anywhere between $100 and $700 and up. According to Breceda, he is a self- taught metal works artist. Some of Breceda's sculptures include a stagecoach pulled by horses, a bear, and a scorpion. Breceda also makes statues of people, most of which are based on people from the old west (such as cowboys) and Native American figures. One of Breceda's most notable sculptures is a 350-foot serpent found in Borrego Springs whose head and body pops out of the sand. Other notable examples of Breceda's work includes fighting dinosaur statues and a series of wild horse sculptures as seen from Highway 79 South. His daughter assists in the sculpting of his statues. Breceda hosted an Open House Art and Music Festival at his studio in the Vail Lake Resort RV Park. The event played host to more than 20 local artists, and in addition to selling their art, these artists were also creating art at the event. The artists at the event include airbrush specialists, oil painters, canvas painters, chalk art, face painters and body painters. The event featured live music from bands, such as SantanaWays.  Recognition  According to Borrego Springs' Chamber of Commerce Executive Director Linda Haddock, the town receives thousands of visitors who come to see his art, and four out of five people who haven't been to the town before who visit the Chambers' office are looking to see his art. A biography about Ricardo Breceda and his art work was written by biographer and historian Diana Lindsay. The book covers his early years as an artist, how he came to get into it, and other aspects of his life and career. Breceda's sculptures were featured in a list of the 11 best art spots in Southern California outside of Los Angeles written by Priscilla Frank for The Huffington Post. The Anza-Borrego Desert was named as The San Diego Union-Tribunes fifth favorite state park, and used a picture of Breceda's serpent sculpture. Another article written by Carolina Gusman for The San Diego Union-Tribune recommended the Anza-Borrego Desert for people looking for a vacation that's low budget due in part to Breceda's sculptures. Alta Vista Botanical Gardens in Vista, CA has acquired nine of Ricardo Breceda's sculptures including a large five piece serpent sculpture which have been installed in various locations throughout the Gardens  References   External links  Location of working Sculpture garden Mexican sculptors American sculptors Artists from Durango Living people People from Perris, California People from Borrego Springs, California Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Ricardo Breceda"},{"id":"46532686","text":"Estelle is an unincorporated community in Walker County, in the U.S. state of Georgia.

While studying a degree in law at the University of Buenos Aires in the 90s, Bregman joined the Socialist Workers' Party (PTS), a Trotskyist Argentine party of which she is among the main referents. She was one of the lawers who took the case of Jorge Julio L√≥pez, an eyewitness of the Dictatorship who disappeared in 2006 after testifying against Miguel Osvaldo Etchecolatz, who was sentenced to life imprisonment and charged with genocide accusations for the crimes he committed during the Dictatorship. In 1997 she founded the Professionist Center for Human Rights (CeProDH), which defends and assesses laid off and unemployed workers and intervenes against repression and impunity, and the Justicia Ya! (Justice Now) Collective, who are appellants in cases of crimes against humanity during the dictatorship's regime of state terrorism. She has been nominated for national deputy in 2009 and Chief of government of the City of Buenos Aires in 2011 and 2015 by the Workers' Left Front (comprising, among others, the PTS). In 2015 she became a national deputy for Buenos Aires Province, holding the seat by rotation for the Workers' Left Front (FIT) until 2016 and being widely supported by several sectors. Since December 2017, she is a deputy in the legislature for the City of Buenos Aires, where she's president of the Human Rights and Anti- Discrimination Commission. She also ran as vice-presidential candidate for the Front in the 2015 Argentine general election, coming fourth.  Cases on working people's rights  Myriam Bregman has participated in defending and assessing employed and unemployed workers in Buenos Aires City and in the provinces of Buenos Aires and Neuqu√©n. Since 1998, she is a lawyer of the Zanon tile factory in Neuqu√©n, being among those who acted in the historical case where the Zan√≥n tile company was found guilty of issuing an \\"offensive lock out\\".La ingenier√≠a jur√≠dica detr√°s de Zan√≥n. She also stood out in the defense of Catalina Balaguer, a female PepsiCo worker and activist who was fired unjustly and was later reincorporated although she was not formally a union delegate (\\"de facto delegate\\"). Bregman also represented PepsiCo workers against the illegal closure of the Vicente L√≥pez factory on June 20, 2017 and denounced attourney Gast√≥n Larramendi, who ordered the factory's eviction a week earlier.  Cases against state repression and persecution  Bregman has participated in several court cases defending activists and workers from police repression and political and trade union persecution. She is also part of Carla Lacorte's team of lawyers. Lacorte, victim of repression herself, is also a member of the CeProDH along with Bregman. Bregman also participates in the case investigation of Federal Police agent Am√©rico Balbuena, who infiltrated social organizations to spy on them.  Cases on crimes against humanity  Bregman participated among the appelants of the first trial made since the re-opening of the cases of crimes against humanity perpetrated by criminals of the Argentinian Dictatoship, that of former Buenos Aires police chief Miguel Osvaldo Etchecolatz, where Justicia Ya! La Plata in 2006 accused him of committing genocide. In the final stages of the trial, one of the eyewitnesses, Jorge Julio L√≥pez, disappeared; afterwards, a case on his disappearance was opened and remains so. Bregman was also an appealing lawyer during the trial against Jorge ‚ÄúTigre‚Äù Acosta, on the ESMA case. She intervened on the oral trials against crimes committed in the Higher School of Mechanics of the Navy (ESMA mega-case) against prefect H√©ctor Febr√©s (2007), and in the second trial against 18 genocide criminals, representing, among others, the case of Rodolfo Walsh, Raimundo Villaflor and organisations such as the Former Disappeared Detainees Association (2009-2011). Myriam Bregman was also an appealing lawyer during the oral trial against Cristian Federico Von Wernich in La Plata (2007), accusing him of crimes against humanity committed in Campo de Mayo, the ‚ÄúFloreal Avellaneda‚Äù case in San Mart√≠n, Province of Buenos Aires (2009), \\"Ser√© Mansion\\" case (against Buenos Aires and Mar del Plata repressors in 2008), among others. In 2008 she was awarded by the Human Rights Commission of the Lawyers School of Buenos Aires. In 2016 Carlos Blaquier and Ledesma executives sent her an intimidatory letter as she prepared to travel to Jujuy to receive complaints of grave human rights violations in the province of then-governor Gerardo Morales. Bregman denounced that she received phone call threats in her office after her intervention in the Labour and Budget Commission where she questioned the first employment bill because she considered that it was a measure to legalise outsourcing. Bregman is also among the people who founded and manage the Professionist Center for Human Rights (CeProDH).

Loryea (1839‚Äì1893), commonly known as A.M. Loryea, was a pioneer medical doctor, businessman, and politician in the American states of Oregon and California. Loryea is best remembered as a co-founder of the Oregon Hospital for the Insane in 1859 and as the Superintendent of that state- subsidized facility for many years as well as the elected mayor of East Portland, Oregon. After selling his share of the Oregon Hospital for the Insane to his business partner, J. C. Hawthorne, Loryea became involved in a failed business venture as a patent medicine manufacturer. He later traveled extensively, becoming interested in balneotherapy and opening the first Turkish baths in San Francisco. Biography Early years Abraham M. Loryea was born March 21, 1839, at Charleston, South Carolina. Loryea attended the Medical College of the State of South Carolina, from which he graduated in 1858.Alfred E. Regensburger, \\"Obituary: Dr. A.M. Loryea,\\" Pacific Medical Journal, vol. 36, no. 6 (June 1893), pp. 387-388. Immediately after his graduation Loryea was immediately set to work in Richmond, Virginia, attempting to abate an epidemic of yellow fever that was sweeping the city. Loryea's work was so appreciated by the local medical society that he was presented with an engraved goblet at the end of the crisis as a token of its appreciation. Still a very young man with a sense of adventure, Loryea decided to leave the South to attempt to establish himself on the Pacific coast. He traveled to San Francisco, where he met James C. Hawthorne, a Pennsylvania- born physician nearly two decades his senior who had gone to California during the California gold rush and who had recently completed two terms in the California State Senate as the Senator from Placer County. The pair resolved to set up a partnership in small town of Portland in the new state of Oregon.

From the time of launch the hospital was dedicated to the treatment of non- contagious disease. The hospital seems to have quickly gained support of the Oregon legislature as a semi-official facility for the maintenance and treatment of the mentally ill, with the press reporting in September 1861 that Loryea and Hawthorne were coordinating the contribution of \\"books for the use of the insane,\\" with materials received to be held in trust as property belonging to the state of Oregon.The Weekly Oregonian, vol. 11, no. 42 (Sept. 7, 1861), pg. 3.

During the 1870s Loryea became involved in the banking business, apparently losing money in the process. Turkish bath operator Loryea's patent medicine and banking ventures did not prove successful and his fortune was dissipated, causing him to relocate back to San Francisco. Loryea traveled extensively, visiting Europe and the Middle East, gaining an interest in public baths as an institution. Upon his return to San Francisco, Loryea decided to open a Turkish bath (hammam) on Grant Avenue, working in partnership with another local doctor. His business associate, a certain Dr. Trask, soon left the partnership, but Loryea continued to own and manage the Grant Avenue hammam for several years, eventually selling it to open a new facility located on Post Street, San Francisco, and another in New York City. As a well-traveled and active Republican, Loryea became a personal acquaintance of Ulysses S. Grant and President Chester A. Arthur. He was regarded by his peers as courteous, friendly, and polite. Death and legacy A.M. Loryea died April 24, 1893, after an extended illness at the Rural Health Retreat, located three miles outside St. Helena, California. He was 53 years old at the time of his death. Loryea was survived by his wife Esther, ex-wife Elizabeth Stevens Loryea McCalla,\\"McCalla v.

Both disputes accused Japan of violating numerous articles of the TRIPS Agreement. Both disputes were settled in December 1997, with the involved parties finding mutually agreeable solutions. DS28 was the first case ever brought to the WTO's dispute settlement body based on the TRIPS Agreement. DS28 Since the 1980s, the Office of the United States Trade Representative had been monitoring Japan's distribution of American intellectual property and had been looking to retaliate against them under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974. The United States first filed a request for consultation to the WTO's Dispute Settlement Body on February 14, 1996. The United States claimed that Japan, as a developed country, was not granting the United States most favoured nation status or criminally prosecuting piracy and requested a meeting for February 20, 1996. Japan was accused of violating following articles of the TRIPS Agreement: * Article 3 ‚Äì Members may not treat any member's good any less favorably than their own. * Article 4 ‚Äì All intellectual property has most favored nation status. * Article 14 ‚Äì Protection of performers or producers from the unauthorized reproduction or broadcast of their work * Article 61 ‚Äì The provision of criminal procedure to prevent the willful or commercial copying of intellectual property. * Article 65 ‚Äì Transitional rights for developing and developed nations. * Article 70 ‚Äì Protection of existing works. On February 22, the European Community sent a communication to the involved parties requesting to join in the dispute against Japan, and claimed that there were over 100 million euro worth of pirated or otherwise illegally distributed Japanese recordings, including those of The Beatles, The Who, Eric Clapton, Leonard Bernstein, Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra and Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra in circulation in Japan. On February 29, Japan formally announced to the Dispute Settlement Body that they accepted the European Community's request to join the consultations with the United States. DS42 On May 24, 1996, the European Community filed another request for consultation to the WTO's Dispute Settlement Body, under the pretense Japanese copyright law did not provide a sufficiently long period of protection for foreign producers and performers. Japanese copyright law offered protection to all foreign works produced after January 1, 1971. The European Community claimed that Japan should expand their protection to a fifty-year period, starting January 1, 1946 to comply with the WTO standards on intellectual property. Japan was accused of violating Article 22.1 of the Uruguay Round of the GATT, as well as the following articles of the TRIPS Agreement: * Article 14.6 ‚Äì Protection of performers or producers from the unauthorized reproduction or broadcast of their work as per the Rome Convention and Berne Convention. * Article 70.2 ‚Äì Protection of existing works copyrighted under the Berne Convention. On June 6, 1996, the United States requested to join these consultations, citing an estimated 500 million dollars worth of forgone royalties on recordings from 1946‚Äì1971 in Japan. Their request to join case DS42 is noted as explicitly different concern from case DS28. Japan formally announced to the Dispute Settlement Body that they had accepted the United States' request to join consultations on June 13. Results On February 5, 1997, the United States and Japan notified the Settlement Dispute Body that they had formally settled case DS28. In conclusion, it was agreed that under the TRIPS agreement, WTO members protected the rights of a recording from their country or could request to protect a work for at least fifty years after the end of the calendar year in which the recording was performed or fixed. Japan agreed to modify their copyright laws to fit these new parameters, effective March 1997. Charlene Barshefsky, the United States Trade Representative who negotiated the consultations, described the outcome as a victory for the protection and profitability of iconic American music: \\"We sought ‚Äì and will now obtain ‚Äì protection for U.S. sound recordings from one of the most vibrant and popular periods in the history of American music ‚Äì from the swing music of Duke Ellington, the bebop jazz of John Coltrane, the rock and roll of Elvis Presley, Chuck Berry, Little Richard, Johnny Cash, Patsy Cline and the Sixties sounds of Bob Dylan, the Beach Boys and Otis Redding. The remarkable range and stature of the music produced in that quarter-century makes it an important part of our heritage.\\" Subsequently, on June 4, 1997, the European Community ended the dispute settlement proceedings for case DS42 after concluding the revisions made in response to DS28 had sufficiently solved the issues of protecting existing, copyrighted sound recordings.

It is the promotion's principal championship. The championship was established on September 26, 2002 during the MLW Reload event and was active until February 10, 2004 after the promotion stopped hosting events. Following their resurrection in 2018, Shane Strickland defeated Matt Riddle at The World Championship Finals of an eight- man single-elimination tournament to win the vacant championship. Like all professional wrestling championships, the title is won via the result of a predetermined match. The current champion is Jacob Fatu, who is in his first reign. History On June 15, 2002, Major League Wrestling held an eight-man single-elimination tournament to crown the first MLW Champion at its inaugural Genesis event. Jerry Lynn, Shane Douglas, Vampiro and Taiyo Kea advanced to the semifinals. Douglas defeated Lynn to advance to the finals, and caused the match between Vampiro and Kea to be declared a no contest. As a result, both wrestlers advanced to the finals for a three-way dance. Douglas defeated both Kea and Vampiro to become the first champion. Afterwards, Douglas threw the title down, like he did with the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. Referee John Finnegan threatened that Douglas would be banned from wrestling in Philadelphia, if he didn't defend the title. MLW went on hiatus for three months. Upon the company's return, Satoshi Kojima defeated Jerry Lynn in New York City, New York at MLW Reload on September 26 for the vacant MLW World Heavyweight Championship. Court Bauer would later confirm that this title lineage and belt design was a separate championship from the MLW Championship won by Shane Douglas in June 2002. As such, Kojima was recognised as the first MLW World Heavyweight Champion. Kojima defended the title in his home promotion All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW), with the defenses airing on both MLW Underground TV and AJPW broadcasts in Japan. Kojima lost the title at Hybrid Hell on June 20, 2003 to Mike Awesome. Afterwards, Awesome lost the title to Steve Corino, as Corino exercised Awesome's promise for a title shot. It was later reported that Kojima's employers, AJPW would not allow him to drop the title to an employee of a rival company Pro Wrestling Zero1, which was Steve Corino. Corino remained champion until the promotion closed on February 10, 2004. MLW resumed wrestling operations in July 2017. In January 2018, MLW announced its Road to the World Championship, an eight-man single-elimination tournament to crown a new champion. During the tournament, ACH replaced Tom Lawlor in the semi-finals, after he suffered an injury. On April 12, Shane Strickland defeated Matt Riddle in The World Championship Finals. Low Ki made the first international title defense since 2003 in Claremont, Australia, as he defeated Jonah Rock on November 30 in a New Horizon Pro Wrestling event. Starting in July 2019, MLW would begin playing a Championship Lineage video (similar to New Japan Pro Wrestling) highlighting all previous MLW World Heavyweight Champions before sanctioned Championship matches. This lineage package would once again confirm Shane Douglas as not recognised as part of the MLW World Heavyweight Championship History. Road to the Championship tournament (2018) Reigns The current champion Jacob Fatu As of , , there have been 7 reigns and 1 vacancies. Satoshi Kojima was the inaugural champion, defeating Jerry Lynn at MLW Reload in September 2002. The current champion is Jacob Fatu who is the longest reigning champion at + days.

It is open once a year in spring from March 1 through May 10. The area has a number of attractions, including its \\"Tecolote Giant Ranunculus\\", a greenhouse filled with cymbidium orchids, a 300-by-170-foot American flag made out of red, white, and blue petunias, and musical events. Educational tours are hosted every year for both children and adults; in 2015, more than 7,000 school children were expected to visit through one of these educational tours. A deal was struck to protect The Flower Fields from being used for development. The Flower Fields increased the cost of admission in 2015 by one dollar in order to deal with rising costs due to the recent drought. The fields experience attendance of anywhere between 100,000 and 200,000 visitors every year from all over the world. The fields were given positive press from outlets such as CBS News Los Angeles, NBC News 4 Southern California, and The Huffington Post Travel, which praised the quality of the flora and recommended that people visiting the area to check it out. In addition, Antique Tractor- Wagon rides are available, transporting visitors around the planted fields, stopping off to let folks walk around and enjoy the scenery, and picking them back up are returning then to the start point. The Antique Gas and Steam Engine Museum of Vista, California provides the Antique Tractor & Wagons.

Every spring in Southern California, the land is opened up for people to visit and look at the flora The fields are open to the public from March 1 through May 10. The fields features flowers called the \\"Tecolote Giant Ranunculus\\" as well as other attractions, including a greenhouse with cymbidium orchids and a 300-by-170-foot American flag made out of red, white, and blue petunias. Educational tours to the fields are routinely performed by volunteers. More than 180 volunteers lead tours for both adults and children. The volunteer work was led by Carlsbad resident Joni Miringoff. In 2015, it was anticipated that there would be more than 7,000 school children visiting the fields through these educational tours. In addition to the flower viewing, visitors can experience other non-flower-related attractions. For instance, 2015 had a Kid's Day on March 29, and musical events through April for events such as Bluegrass Day and Zydeco Day. Visitors can also experience the field's \\"sweet pea maze.\\" In 2012, The Flower Fields' owners announced that the color variants in its flowers would be different for the first time in 15 years. The land that the Flower Fields are found was used for the development of a variety of different sites, including amusement parks, shopping malls, and resorts. However, a deal was struck in order to protect the Flower Fields by making sure that they do not get used for development purposes. In 2015, The Flower FIelds increased the cost of admission by one dollar in order to compensate for an increased expenditure due to bad droughts.

Pierce (although Pierce was not credited as directing). It stars William Leslie, Dolores Faith, Pamela Curran and Richard Garland. In the film, Space Station X-7 is overrun by a previously unknown but deadly alien fungus that originated in ice caves on the moon and was inadvertently brought back by astronauts returning with lunar samples. Members of the crew are forced to mutiny against X-7's commander, who is not in his right mind because of \\"space raptures,\\" in order to save the space station from destruction. Mutiny in Outer Space was the second film on a double feature with The Human Duplicators in the US. Plot Maj. Gordon Towers (William Leslie) and Capt. Dan Webber (Carl Crow) are returning to Space Station X-7 after collecting geological samples and ice from newly-discovered ice caves on the moon. Upon arrival, Dan collapses and is taken to the infirmary by Dr. Hoffman (James Dobson), and Gordon is reunited with his girlfriend, Dr. Faith Montaine (Dolores Faith), a civilian biochemist. Hoffman has difficulty diagnosing Dan, ruling out \\"space raptures\\" because they cause hallucinations and not the high fever that Dan has. But Faith notices that a small welt on Dan's leg is growing rapidly into a large fungus. She says that the spores causing the fungus must have come from the ice caves. They put Dan into isolation. Meanwhile, the commander of X-7, Col. Frank Cromwell (Richard Garland), is behaving oddly. As a swarm of meteors approaches the space station, Cromwell is unable to give the order to take evasive action until prodded to do so by X-7's communications officer, Lt. Connie Engstrom (Pamela Curran). Dan dies, his body horribly disfigured by the fungus. But when Cromwell looks at the body in the isolation chamber, he calmly says, \\"There's nothing unusual in there\\" and refuses to report to Gen. Knowland (Glenn Langan) at Earth Control Center that the fungus has killed Dan. He insists that Dan's demise was caused by \\"pressure shock\\" and warns Gordon, Faith and Hoffman to say nothing about the fungus because it might panic the crew of X-7. Hoffman says that Cromwell is \\"on the verge of space raptures\\" and very sick. Gordon decides that the situation is serious enough to remove Cromwell from command. But Gordon fails in his attempt, which Cromwell calls \\"mutiny.\\" Cromwell orders Connie to send a message to Knowland about the mutiny and to say in it that Gordon held the crew at gunpoint until he was overpowered. Connie seemingly agrees, but Cromwell doesn't know that she has surreptitiously recorded the order. She transmits it to Knowland, who is immediately aware that something is amiss as guns were outlawed in space more than 20 years earlier, around 1970. Connie also reports that the entire space station is being overrun by the fungus. Knowland tries to reply to X-7 but gets no response. He says that X-7 may have to be destroyed to prevent the fungus from reaching Earth. Hoffman contracts the fungal infection and is very ill. But he's able to tell Faith and Gordon that the fungus can be killed by cold. Knowing this, Gordon and the others make a second attempt to take control of X-7. Besides the danger from the fungus, Cromwell, now fully in the grips of space raptures, is trying to destroy X-7. They confine Cromwell to his quarters, but he escapes and sabotages the communications system, cutting off all contact between X-7 and the Earth. He is then recaptured. Gordon knows that the only hope of saving X-7 is to lower its interior temperature to below zero degrees. The fungus inside X-7 dies, but it's growing on the outside of the space station as well. No one can understand why the fungus is spreading on X-7's exterior until one of Knowland's staff officers says that it must be due to the \\"high temperatures generated by the unshielded blazing sun\\" beating down on X-7. This gives Knowland the idea of launching a rocket that will explode and form a huge cloud of ice crystals for X-7 to pass through. Knowland's idea works and the fungus on the exterior of X-7 is killed. Gordon uses the repaired communications system to request a relief ship. Knowland tells him that it will arrive at X-7 in three hours and concludes his message by saying, \\"Don't lose your faith.\\" At that, Faith and Gordon look at each other and smile.

The film's budget was approximately $90,000. The production companies were Hugo Grimaldi Film Productions and Woolner Brothers Pictures. Space Station X and Invasion from the Moon were the film's working titles. Although it was filmed in the US, British film critic Phil Hardy lists it in The Overlook Film Encyclopedia: Science Fiction as an Italian-American co-production. Mutiny in Outer Space is \\"one of a pair\\" of such co-productions \\"directed in 1965 by Grimaldi (the other being The Human Duplicators).\\"  Release  Mutiny in Outer Space was released in the US as the second film on a double feature with The Human Duplicators. It was released on 3 March 1965 and premiered in Los Angeles on 12 May 1965 and opened in the UK and Mexico at unspecified dates that year, in West Germany on 11 November 1966, and at an unspecified date in Italy. The film was titled Motin en la Nave Espacial in Mexico; SS-X-7 Panik im All in West Germany; and Ammutinamento nello spazio (a.k.a. Gli Ammutinati dello spazio) in Italy. The movie was distributed by Woolner Brothers Pictures in the US and by Regal Films International in the UK, both during 1965. Allied Artists took over US theatrical distribution in 1966, the same year that Goldeck-Filmverleih distributed it to theaters in West Germany. For home viewing, VZ-Handelsgeschellschaft released it on DVD in Germany in 2013. International Film Distributors in Canada hold the all-media distribution rights. Mutiny in Outer Space is also included in Shiver & Shudder Show, a video released in the US by Something Weird Video in 2002. The video features segments from 47 science fiction and horror films from the 1950s, 60s and 70s. Reception Writing on 12 May 1965, \\"Whit,\\" a reviewer for Variety, said that Mutiny in Outer Space \\"stacks up as a suitable minor entry.\\" But he went on to praise \\"Grimaldi's direction of the Arthur C. Pierce script\\" and said that the film was \\"deftly lensed\\" by cinematographer Archie R. Dalzell and that \\"George White's editing is a plus.\\" Modern American film scholar Gary Westphal praises the film for making \\"important points about the dangerous effects of prolonged life in space.\\" However, he writes, it better \\"recalls more fanciful films,\\" such as The Green Slime, than it does the more documentary-like 1950s films Project Moon Base and Conquest of Space. He says that Mutiny in Outer Space is reminiscent of \\"Specimen: Unknown,\\" a February 1964 episode of the TV series The Outer Limits, which is also in his \\"fanciful\\" category. Like Westphal, Bryan Senn, an American film critic, sees both good and bad in Mutiny in Outer Space. He writes that \\"Richard Garland gives a good performance as the stressed-out space skipper\\" and refers kindly to the rest of the cast as \\"overworked [and] presumably underpaid.\\" On the other hand, Senn calls the movie a \\"mishmash\\" that suffers from \\"shoddy black- and-white production values and substandard special effects\\" and says that \\"scenes aboard the X-7 are shot in gloomy darkness, adding to the film's unmistakable look of cheapness.\\" An anonymous reviewer in TV Guide sees the film as more-or-less of a historical failure, writing that \\"By the time of the film's release, space travel was less mysterious than it had been in the genre's heyday 10 years before. Thus this routine fare, with standard production values and acting, was simply too late to stir up much interest.\\" However, more recently, Mutiny in Outer Space was revived specifically for Women's History Month. The film was chosen for its unusually high number of women cast as astronauts aboard X-7 and as military personnel on Earth. It was shown on 17 March 2017 as part of a 16 mm film series at The Newman Center in Plattsburgh, NY.

Gallery of Helen Hitchings At age 28 Hitchings opened New Zealand‚Äôs first modernist dealer gallery, in a converted warehouse space at 39 Bond Street in central Wellington. Previous to this she had worked as a theatre designer and advertising assistant. In the gallery Hitchings showed the work of emerging painters who went on to become major figures in New Zealand art, including Toss Woollaston, Rita Angus and Colin McCahon, alongside Douglas MacDiarmid and Evelyn Page. She recruited the modernist architect Ernst Plischke to produce furniture designs sold through the gallery, and A. R. D. Fairburn and May Smith to design textiles. Hitchings also showed the work of important potter Len Castle. Hitchings also designed pieces of pottery which were commercially produced and sold through her gallery. Hitchings sought to create an informal atmosphere at the gallery, serving visitors coffee and encouraging them to touch and feel for themselves. In a radio interview in 1950 she said \\"The atmosphere says immediately - come in, have a cigarette and look at and feel and handle everything, and see what ideas you get and equally important, what are the ideas of others . . . There are no KEEP OFF THE GRASS signs anywhere in the gallery.\\" Contemporary photographs of the gallery show a simple, airy space where furniture, ceramics, textiles and artworks are displayed together, suggesting how a modern home could be decorated. In 1951 Hitchings went to London, taking a selection of New Zealand art with her to exhibit. On her return she was unable to reopen her gallery, but despite the short period in which it operated, the gallery is recognised as an important moment in the post-war development of New Zealand culture, especially in terms of creating an audience for modernist work. Art historian Gordon Brown has observed that the gallery created ‚Äòa clientele who more easily were able to develop a sense of artistic discrimination through exposure to a continuously changing display of carefully selected paintings, prints and handicrafts‚Äô Recognition and influence In 2008 the Museum of Wellington City & Sea staged an exhibition recreating Hitchings‚Äô gallery. In 2015 the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa opened an exhibition The Gallery of Helen Hitchings which features photographs of Hitchings alongside objects sold through or similar to those presented at her gallery. In 2016 Wellington artist Erica van Zon produced a body of work in homage to Hitchings, titled Coffee Perhaps. The work was displayed at The Dowse Art Museum. Further information The archives of the Helen Hitchings Gallery are held in the Te Papa archives. Justine Olsen, curator of Decorative and Applied Arts at Te Papa, was interviewed about Helen Hitchings and the influence of her gallery in 2015.

They had a late onset in Yucat√°n compared with the rest of Mexico because of geographical, ecological and economical reasons, particularly the poor quality of the soil and lack of water to irrigate farms. Commonly the farms were initially used exclusively for cattle ranching, with a low density of labor, becoming over time maize-growing estates in the north and sugar plantations in the south, before finally becoming henequen estates. \\"Haciendas henequeneras\\" refers to estates in the Yucat√°n which were created during the 19th century when the henequen industry debuted. The hacienda henequenera required large staffing for the cultivation of the fields, as well as, the development and maintenance of industrial processes, such as defiberating the leaves. One of the regions of Yucat√°n which had produced maize but evolved into the henequen industry is the area adjoining and near to M√©rida. Along the main roads and in the \\"camino real\\" between Campeche and M√©rida, these haciendas became established. By the 19th century, the hacienda henequenera developed on a wider scale throughout Yucat√°n, particularly in the north-central region, where the soil was better suited for the cultivation of henequen. History The haciendas of Yucat√°n were agricultural organizations that emerged in the late seventeenth century and during the eighteenth century. Unlike in the rest of Mexico and in most of Latin America, these farms in this region were not established immediately after the conquest and during the seventeenth century. In Yucat√°n, because of geographical, ecological and economical conditions, particularly soil quality and lack of water for irrigation, onset of agricultural estates was delayed. Livestock breeding and early agriculture In Yucat√°n, the first regions where haciendas were established were adjacent or near the capital of M√©rida along the main roads and the highway between Campeche and M√©rida. Predominantly from the sixteenth to the eighteenth centuries there was no large scale production and the haciendas were strictly for raising livestock, which did not require concentrations of labor. Agricultural production was limited to feeding the livestock. From the middle of the eighteenth century to the mid-nineteenth century commercial agriculture was introduced because of growing urban demand and rising profitability potential. Initially the crop grown was maize, but increasingly the change was made to henequen production, in the cases of the estates of Itzincab, San Antonio Sodzil, Temoz√≥n, Uayalceh, Xtepen, and Yaxcopoil, among others. In areas farther from M√©rida, sugar cane and livestock breeding were more prevalent. The Caste War of Yucat√°n, which began around 1847, destroyed much of the sugar industry in the southern and eastern parts of the peninsula. The invention of the mechanical scraper in 1852 for pulping and high demand for rope, convinced farm owners throughout the state of Yucat√°n to switch to the production of sisal, though the north and northwest part of the state is typically known as the \\"henequen zone\\". Between 1868 and 1871 steam-driven machinery began being imported to process sugar. Many of these \\"powerhouses\\" on the haciendas were later converted to process sisal. Approximately 160 machines were imported. Some of the largest were for the haciendas of Uayalceh, Miraflores and Acu, all with 20 horsepower motors; Yaxcopoil with a 16 horsepower motor; Xcehus with a 14 horsepower motor; Lepan, Sodzil, Mukuich√©; and with 10 horsepower motors: Canicab, Cheum√°n, Humchectam√°n, ltzincab, San Antonio Ool, San Bernardo, San Ignacio, Santa Maria, Tankuch√©, Tecoh, Texan, Teya, Ticop√≥, Tzitz, Xcucul, Xcuyun, Xtabay, and Yaxch√©. Henequen boom Previous to the emergence of the henequen industry, landowners lived in M√©rida and treated their landholdings as occasional retreats. With the emergence of henequen and the wealth it produced, the farms were transformed into haciendas which typically had a grand manor house, the machine house, and a chapel. Because a large population was needed to take care of the properties, workers were provided with housing and the amenities of a community. The foreman usually has his own home, and there were storage buildings, the hydraulics or pump house, a school, an infirmary, a store, the stables and a jail. Servants on the estates lived in a situation that was very similar to that of the bonded serfdom of the peasants of medieval Europe. They were not slaves, as they retained some civil rights, but they were not free, as they were bound to the land, forced to serve against their will, and in the absence of any type of currency at the governmental level were paid in hacienda tokens. These coins were issued by the hacienda owners to pay workers, but could only be exchanged for goods on the hacienda or at the \\"company store\\". As there were perpetual labor shortages, indentured servants were also brought in from China, Korea and the Canary Islands. In addition to their cultivation of the fields, workers were required to provide unpaid labor for the tasks necessary to keep the hacienda running. On Hacienda Kochol, workers performed \\"faginas\\" twice a day, which included tasks like building repair and construction, grounds maintenance, and road clearing and repair. The era of the henequen boom from the late 1800s to the early 1900s was known as the time of \\"green gold\\". At the height of the boom, there were nearly 1,200 haciendas within an 80 km radius around the city of M√©rida. The haciendas changed the development of M√©rida, as many of them became what are neighborhoods of the city. Hacienda San Cosme is now Colonia Garc√≠a Giner√©s; Hacienda Tecoh covered what now makes up Colonia San Jos√© Tecoh, Colonia Castilla C√°mara, Colonia Mercedes Barrera, Cinco Colonias and the Fraccionamiento Zacil Ha; Hacienda San Isidro is now Colonia Melit√≥n Salazar; Hacienda San Diego Azcorra is now Colonia Azcorra, Colonia Miraflores, Colonia Unidad Habitacional Morelos, Colonia Morelos Oriente and Colonia Salvador Alvarado Sur; Hacienda Wallis is now Colonia Chumin√≥polis and Colonia La Esperanza; Haciendas Petcanch√© and Hacienda Chich√≠ Su√°rez are now Colonia Jes√∫s Carranza, Colonia Miguel Alem√°n, and Colonia Chich√≠ Su√°rez, just to name a few. Bust and after-effects The wealth from the boom paid for city streets as well as public buildings, spaces and services, which increased the population of the city tremendously. When the Mexican Revolution arrived in Yucat√°n around 1915, some of the hacendados chose to abandon their holdings. Others who had borrowed during the boom and overinvested, were unable to repay after the bust, when the sisal prices declined after the stock market crash of 1929. The Great Depression which followed the 1929 crash caused declining exports worldwide. However, because the boom had diversified the economy, built infrastructure and connected the haciendas with the city, when people relocated to the city during the bust seeking work, the housing demands on the city were minimized, as the close-in haciendas transformed into neighborhoods. All of the henequen plantations ceased to exist as autonomous communities with the agrarian land reform implemented by President Lazaro Cardenas in 1937. His decree turned the haciendas into collective ejidos, leaving only 150 hectares to the former landowners for use as private property. Lack of knowledge of how to run a business and poor management on behalf of some of the collectives led to further declines in the industry. In the mid-1940s, when synthetic fibers were invented, the henequen industry plummeted further. Preservation of heritage within the M√©rida Municipality In the 1990s, some of the Yucat√°n haciendas recovered their economic growth and appeal, as hotels and resorts. Of the 105 Municipalities in the state, only M√©rida has to date taken measures to preserve the hacienda heritage. The City of M√©rida initiated a project in 1996 to identify the former haciendas in the immediate metropolitan area. 51 have been classified to date and of that 51, 48 have declared Cultural Heritage Areas and divided into 6 zones. The designation offers additional protections to historic haciendas, even if they already have some federal protections. In these zones land use, construction and demolition are highly regulated to protect the historical context.

It features five new songs by the group and a medley of two Gene Vincent covers, \\"Say Mama\\" and \\"Race With the Devil\\". The title track was previously played live. Curiously, \\"Race With the Devil\\" is not a new recording, but a live performance recorded at the John Peel's 50th-anniversary concert back in 1989 with the Extricate lineup; this recording had previously appeared on The Fall Red Box Set 1976-2007. The last song, \\"Touchy Pad\\" features Tamsin Middleton of Manchester band Mr Heart on vocals. The release was explained as a bridging point by the record company. The vinyl version features earlier mixes that differ from the CD. The release was followed by a number of live-shows.  Critical reaction  The Quietus described the title track as \\"full of mischief and malevolence\\" and the rest of the EP as \\"answering the call of the weird\\". Pitchfork noted the longevity of the line-up as \\"an encouraging sign that stability has yet to ossify into stagnation with this ongoing iteration of the band, who formidably exercise their elasticity over the course of these six wildly divergent tracks\\". The Line of Best Fit commented that the EP \\"isn‚Äôt necessarily consistently solid, but it‚Äôs decidedly close.

It stars Dakota Johnson, Rebel Wilson, Alison Brie, Leslie Mann, Damon Wayans Jr., Anders Holm, Nicholas Braun, Jake Lacy and Jason Mantzoukas. It was released on February 12, 2016, by Warner Bros. Pictures. Plot Alice (Dakota Johnson) temporarily dumps her college boyfriend Josh and moves to New York City to be a paralegal. She moves in with her sister, Meg, an OB/GYN who refuses to have a baby or relationship. Alice befriends wild Australian co-worker Robin, who enjoys partying and one-night stands, and local bartender Tom, who embraces the bachelor lifestyle and hooks up with various women, including Alice. Tom meets Lucy at his bar when she uses his Internet for free; she explains she is looking for \\"The One\\" using various dating sites. Alice meets with Josh to tell him that she is ready to get back together with him. Josh explains he is seeing someone else, which distresses Alice. Meg has a change of heart while watching over a baby and decides to have a child of her own via a sperm donor. Shortly after she becomes pregnant, Meg unexpectedly hooks up with a younger man, Ken, after meeting him at Alice's office Christmas party. Ken, the law office receptionist, is smitten with her. She tries to break it off, but he continues to pursue her cutely. Thinking Ken is too young for her to have a future with, she hides the pregnancy from him. Back at Tom's bar, Lucy has a string of horrible dates, at which point Tom realizes that he has feelings for her. In an attempt to put herself out there, Alice attends a networking event, where she hits it off with a man named David. Lucy has been in a relationship for three weeks with a man named Paul, who reveals that he has been seeing other people, thinking she was doing the same, and breaks up with her. Lucy breaks down at her volunteer job reading to kids at a bookstore. George, who works there, soothes her, and the two begin a relationship. Alice and Robin attend Josh's holiday party; Alice finds she cannot watch Josh with his new girlfriend. She runs into David, who shows her a private view of the Rockefeller Christmas tree, dazzling her, and they begin a relationship. Three months later, as she is singing with David's daughter Phoebe, David becomes upset with her, reminding her that she's not Phoebe's mother. His wife died two years ago and he believes it's too soon for Phoebe to have a stepmother. David and Alice break up as a result. Tom becomes upset with Lucy's relationship with George, and invites Alice to get drunk. The two talk about their frustrations with their feelings for Josh and Lucy and sleep together to distract themselves. Ken discovers Meg is pregnant but is eager to help raise her child. Meg, concerned that he is not truly committed, ends the relationship. At Alice's birthday party, Robin invites Tom, David, and Josh without Alice's knowledge, as she thought it would be funny. Shaken by the presence of all three men, Alice argues with Robin. Tom confesses to Lucy, but she announces that she is engaged to George. Josh approaches Alice, and they make out but stop when Josh reveals to a horrified Alice that he is now engaged and was merely looking for closure with her. Invigorated by a desire to find herself, Alice leaves to go home. Her cab hits Robin, who was trying to get a cab for Meg, who is in labor. They rush to the hospital, where Meg delivers a baby girl. Ken convinces Meg to try their relationship again, while Alice repairs her relationship with Robin. The film closes with Alice reflecting on her time living alone and being single. Meg and Ken are together, while Robin continues her old habits. Tom opens up to the possibilities of non-casual relationships. Lucy marries George, and David tells his daughter the truth about her mother's death. Finally, Alice is seen hiking the Grand Canyon by herself so that she can witness the sunrise on New Year's Day: a dream she always had.

Professional career   Contact Plus  Zaki's professional career began in 2002 at Contact Plus, a BTL division of Interflow Communications. He worked in the Strategy Department as Activation Manager under the leadership of Syed Abdul Karim Tanveer.https://plus.google.com/+SyedAbdulKarimTanveer/about Syed Abdul Karim Tanveer His work involved lead and management of loyalty clubs to encourage development of products such as Lipton, the tea brand of Unilever Pakistan.

He directed and produced \\"Sajjad Mir kay Sath\\", \\"Taboo\\", \\"Front Page\\" and many other current affairs and infotainment programs including hosting a number of religious shows himself like \\"Sirat e Mustaqeem\\" and \\"Deen Dialogue\\". Within two years of joining TV One/News ONE, Taher A. Khan asked him to head and lead the current affairs and infotainment department as Sajjad Mir left News One for Waqt News, Lahore. He also conducted a number of current affairs and political talk shows like \\"Front Page\\" and \\"Election Beat\\" focusing on Terrorism, Talibanization, Sectarianism and Security issues. LUBPAK Zaki was an editor for Let Us Build Pakistan, a blog aimed at supporting \\"a progressive, inclusive and democratic Pakistan.\\" This blog was censored and blocked by PTA for viewers within Pakistan.  Civil society activism   Sit-in outside CM house Karachi  Pakistani civil society which was mainly dormant after their last vocal and meaningful protest campaign during the lawyers movement, against Gen Musharraf, became revitalised and functional again in the aftermath of the APS attack, Peshawar. The Government of Pakistan announced a crackdown on all banned terrorist outfits and a \\"National Action Plan\\" was announced to counter and control the menace of growing religious extremism and terrorism in Pakistan. The Constitution of Pakistan was also amended with 21st amendment which specifically calls for military trial of terrorist groups, terrorists and organisations using the name of religion or a sect for carrying out their terrorist activities. A long-held moratorium on the death penalty was also lifted for quick execution of terrorists. But despite the fact that there was general consensus amongst Pakistanis from all walks of life for strict action against these banned terrorist groups, the government rather faltered and ditched the hopes by not taking any action whatsoever against terrorist outfits and even execution of terrorists from these banned outfits (ASWJ, LeJ, TTP) was subsequently and mysteriously stopped without giving any reason. Taking advantage of this situation the militant wing of banned terrorist outfit ASWJ struck once again in Shikarpur by attacking a Shia mosque during Friday prayers and congregation on 30 January 2015. Khurram Zaki announced a sit-in outside CM house Karachi and requested other civil society activists to join the same on 2 February 2015. Khurram Zaki had a brief scuffle and verbal exchange with police officials when, while leading the protest, he tried to enter the red-zone. Eventually after more than 30 hours of sit-in and continuous negotiations with government officials including Sharmila Farooqui, Rashid Rabbani and Waqar Mehdi, the government accepted the demands of the protestors and Sharmila Farooqui announced on Electronic media during a press conference that ASWJ is a terrorist outfit and the Sindh government would soon conduct a crack down on them according to the national action plan. This promise was never followed through on, though.  Arrest from outside CM house Karachi  Only a day after the government promise on media that they would rein in the activities of ASWJ, the banned outfit announced rallies on 5 February 2015 to support the Kashmir cause. Such rallies were not only against government promises but all the statutory laws of the land including Anti Terrorism Act, Protection of Pakistan Act and National Action Plan drafted and approved after APS attack. Getting news of the planned rallies by ASWJ, the civil society responded swiftly by announcing another sit-in outside CM house if the banned outfit was allowed to hold rallies. ASWJ not only took out rallies on the same day but also managed to enter the red-zone and hold their own sit-in there with police, rangers and other law enforcement agencies kept watching this blatant violation of the law under their own nose. As announced in press club, Khurram Zaki, Jibran Nasir, Noor e Maryam and other civil society activists reached CM from the other side (Karachi Club side) and started their protest against banned outfit and Sindh administration for not keeping up their promises. On the other side of CM House ASWJ was doing their own protest against Civil Society and Khurram Zaki. Police officials and district administration preferred to crack down on Civil Society activists instead of ASWJ and around 25 were arrested immediately for entering red zone including Khurram Zaki. These 25 were only released after huge masses and protestors started converging on police station demanding their immediate release. The episode of the arrest of civil society peaceful activists again showed and exposed the vulnerability and weakness of civil government and infrastructure in front of these banned \\"jihadi\\" outfits. Police couldn't arrest even one of the ASWJ terrorists from other side of the CM house.  Protest outside Lal Masjid Islamabad and arrest  On 16 December 2015, the first anniversary of Army Public School Peshawar massacre, Khuuram Zaki announced a Civil Society protest outside Lal Masjid Islamabad. District administration and security and intelligence apparatus tried to persuade him to change the location of protest citing intelligence reports and apprehensions that the protest may be targeted by terrorist outfits. A meeting with the district administration on the invitation of the DC Islamabad held same day. He reiterated that peaceful protests are constitutional right of every citizen and thus he and other civil society activists would continue with their planned protest. When he along with his wife, kids and other acitivists reached the Lal Masjid at the given time (2 pm) heavy contingent of police was already deployed there to disperse the protesters. As soon as they started chanting slogans against Molvi Abdul Aziz, Taliban and Extremism, Deputy Superintendent of Police, supported by number of police constables, intervened and ordered the arrest of all the protesters. The protesters were holding Pakistani national flag at that time, chanting slogans against Molvi Abdul Aziz and banned outfits including Taliban. They were not disrupting any traffic or public order as such. Police constables grabbed Khurram Zaki and dragged him towards the police van. He continued to ask them for the reasons of arrest as they had not broken any law of the land. The news of the protest and arrest was telecasted on major news channels as \\"breaking news\\". Not only Khurram Zaki but his wife, 16-year-old daughter Mariam Fatima and many other women activists were also arrested from the scene and were taken to Abpara Police Station, Islamabad. They were only released after interior minister Ch. Nisar Ali Khan intervened and ordered to release them. Interior minister said that there was no reason to arrest the peaceful protesters. He also ordered the suspension of SHO and Show Cause notice was served to Superintendent of the Police, Islamabad. The arrests caused an uproar on social media and the issue of Lal Masjid and Molvi Abdul Aziz once again came in limelight with parliamentarians raising the issue in National Assembly. Renowned Civil Society activists and academicians Farzana Bari and Pervez Hoodbhoy were also part of this protest. Dr. Ayesha Siddiqa, former visiting scholar at the Johns Hopkins University has also written an article which provides theme of protests.  Death  During the late hours of 7 May 2016, Zaki, while eating dinner at a restaurant in Sector-11B of North Karachi, was fatally shot by unknown assailants riding on two motorcycles. Zaki was killed, while a journalist, Khalid Rao, and a pedestrian, Aslam, were injured. Different organizations, including rights activists, staged protests and rallies against his murder. His funeral prayer was organized outside CM House and he was laid to rest in Wadi Hussain (A.S) graveyard Karachi. Legacy His son Ali, a teenager, following the agitation mode of his father has alone registered the protest lifting in his hands placard, against government inaction in front of Chief Minister House, Karachi. He demanded the Sindh chief minister to admonish the relevant police officers to reopen the murder case and bring the ASWJ terrorists to book.

Her work relies heavily on the imprint that individual experience has on the artist, and centers on the production of sculpture, installation, and prints. Biography American artist Carson Fox works primarily in sculpture. Her study of art began at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, where she received a four-year studio certificate. At PAFA, she was awarded the Cresson Memorial Traveling Scholarship, funding three months of European study and an additional fellowship year at the institution. Fox received her BFA from the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, and earned her MFA from Rutgers University. Fox has been included in solo and group shows in the United States and abroad. She is represented by Linda Warren Projects, Chicago. Exhibitions In 2000, Fox received her first major solo exhibition, \\"Beauty Queens,\\" at Rider University Gallery in Lawrenceville, New Jersey. Since then, her work has been exhibited in solo exhibitions at museums and galleries across the United States, including at the Boulder Museum of Contemporary Art, the Jersey City Museum, and the New Britain Museum of American Art. Carson Fox has been featured in over fifty significant national and international group exhibitions, including shows at the Museum of Arts and Design, Scottsdale Museum of Contemporary Art, the Jersey City Museum, Nassau County Museum of Art, the Novosibirsk State Art Museum, Indiana State Museum, University Museums at the University of Delaware, Tweed Museum of Art. In 2009, Fox was commissioned by the Metropolitan Transit Authority (NYC), to complete a large scale, permanent public work at the Long Island Railroad Station in Seaford, New York Collections Fox's work is included in a number of prominent museum collections around the world, including the Museum of Arts and Design (New York), the Jersey City Museum, the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts Museum, Novosibirsk State Art Museum, Russia, and the Royal Museum of Belgium, among others. Corporate collections include Eaton Corporation (*9),Catamaran Corporation, and Kirkland and Ellis, LLP. Work Sculpture Carson Fox's current practice centers on the creation of resin sculptural works that examine the tensions between nature and artifice, the awe of visual spectacle, and humanity's desire to bridle nature and time. Recent work can be categorized as flower, tree, sea, and rock forms. With nature as her subject, Fox contemplates humanity's relationship to the physical world in a profound, symbolic way that speaks to both personal and societal associations. The sculptures are intensely labored, composed of multiple parts of pigmented and cast resin the artist assembles and carves. David McFadden, former chief curator of the Museum of Arts and Design in New York, wrote of her work, \\"Fox invites the viewer into a world that teeters precariously between the real and the unreal, the beautiful and the unsettling.\\" In 2011, Carson Fox presented a solo show at The New Britain Museum of American Art, titled \\"Bi-Polar.\\" NBMAA wrote about the show: Bi-Polar is a visually stunning work, but also one that holds inherent potential to evoke emotion. This potential is realized and ignited once the poignant symbolism behind the visual vocabulary is understood, enveloping the viewer in the artist‚Äôs personal history. At the same time, Bi-Polar invites the viewer into a wider world of questions regarding the universal human desire to resist against the forces of natural order, push the boundaries of what is within or beyond our control, and ultimately arrest time. Ice Storm, at Redux Contemporary Art Center in Charleston, SC, shared similar themes. David McFadden, the former chief curator of the Museum of Art and Design, NYC, wrote in the exhibition catalog: The [installations] establish an ambiance of threat and danger that undermines the sheer physical beauty of the [forms]‚Ä¶ Fox's fantasies‚Ä¶ hold time in abeyance- what should melt away is made permanent. Change (and by implication, death) is effectively checkmated. At her 2014 solo exhibition at Linda Warren Projects titled Mimesis, sculptures of coral, crystals, and other natural forms dominated the gallery. Art critic B. David Zarley wrote: Across Fox‚Äôs lavish installation creeps the delicious subversion that comes from recreating-perhaps even improving upon ‚Äì shock! Blasphemy! ‚Äì natural beauty with toxic media. It becomes difficult to tell, through the pulchritude and plastic, whether fox is sanctifying nature or supplanting it, genuflecting before creation or substituting her own; she pulls forth these beautiful, terrible ideas, as she does the chthonian forms comprising the bulk of ‚ÄúMimesis.‚Äù The artist says of her work: ‚ÄúMy goal is for (the work) to seem preposterous and wondrous, to underscore that nothing is more perplexing, complex, and extraordinary than nature.‚Äù Prints Fox's prints embody the same spirit as her sculptural works, \\"unabashedly and unapologetically beautiful,\\" but \\"hinting at a more complicated and darker core.\\" (*14) Fox commands a variety of print media, including etchings, digital prints, lithographs and relief prints. Having grown up in the American South, \\"Fox was exposed to a Southern gothic aesthetic and folk art tradition.\\" (*14) Her works are repetitive and labor-intensive, employing visual elements from Victorian paper works. Fox writes of her work: My natural inclination is to be interested in objects and themes that have been left out of the history of art, feeling a particular kinship with marginalized ‚Äúcraft‚Äù materials, and the popular illustrations and folk art of the Victorian era. Like the Victorians, the fragility and brevity of life terrifies me, and one way I cope with it is to make things; thereby proving my existence through the evidence of my labor. Many recent prints contain physical evidence of this labor. Fox pokes thousands of holes into the printed image, ‚Äúsuggesting invisible routes made visible, a tangible history of [her] own industry, while transforming the paper into a lacy map.\\" Work as an Educator, Lecturer, Curator In addition to her professional artistic practice, Fox maintains an academic career as a collegiate level educator, lecturer, and curator. Her teaching experience includes Harvard University, New York University, Rutgers University, and the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, before joining the faculty at Adelphi University in Garden City, New York. Fox has lectured widely on printmaking and sculpture across the United States and abroad, including at Boston University, Maryland Institute College of Art, University of the Arts, and Rutgers University.

The first stone and mortar temples of South India were constructed during Pallava rule and were based on earlier brick and timber prototypes. Starting with rock cut temples, built between 695AD and 722AD, and archaeological excavations dated to the 6th century and earlier.Group of Monuments at Mahabalipuram, Dist. Kanchipuram , Archaeological Survey of India (2014) Pallava sculptors later graduated to free-standing structural shrines which inspired Chola dynasty's temples of a later age. Some of the best examples of Pallava art and architecture are the Kailasanathar Temple at Kanchipuram, the Shore Temple and the Pancha Rathas of Mahabalipuram. Akshara was the greatest sculptor of their time.Mamallapuram, Encyclopedia Britannica  History of Pallava architecture  Pallava architecture was sub-divided into two phases: the rock cut phase and the structural phase. The rock cut phase lasted from the 610 AD to 668 AD and consisted of two groups of monuments, the Mahendra group and the Mamalla group. The Mahendra group is the name given to monuments constructed during the reign of Mahendravarman I (610 AD- 630 AD). The monuments of this group are invariably pillared halls hewn out of mountain faces. These pillared halls or mandapas follow the prototype of Jain temples of the period. The best examples of Mahendra group of monuments are the cave temples at Mandagapattu, Pallavaram and Mamandur. The second group of rock cut monuments belong to the Mamalla group in 630 to 668 AD. During this period free-standing monolithic shrines called rathas (chariots) were constructed alongside pillared halls. Some of the best examples of this style are the Pancha Rathas and Arjuna's Penance at Mahabalipuram. Pallava Pillar Mandagappattu, 7th century The second phase of Pallava architecture is the structural phase when free-standing shrines were constructed with stone and mortar brought in for the purpose. Monuments of this phase are of two groups - the Rajasimha group (690 to 800 AD) and the Nandivarman group (800 to 900 AD). The Rajasimha group encompasses the early structural temples of the Pallavas when a lot of experimentation was carried out. The best examples of this period are the Shore Temple at Mahabalipuram and the Kanchi Kailasanathar Temple at Kanchipuram both constructed by Narasimhavarman II who was known as Rajasimha. The best example of the Nandivarman group of monuments is the Vaikunta Perumal Temple at Kanchipuram. During this period, Pallava architecture attained full maturity and provided the models upon which the massive Brihadeeswarar Temple of the Cholas at Thanjavur and Gangaikonda Cholapuram and various other architectural works of note were constructed.

Historical 'Ndrangheta boss of Bardonecchia and Val di Susa, was the Godfather of the 'Ndrangheta in Piedmont. Lo Presti was the first mobster sent in soggiorno obbligato (coerced stay), in northern Italy. Bardonecchia is an alpine town in the province of Turin, in Piedmont, on the border with France and one of the main ski resorts in Italy. For judges of Turin, Lo Presti was instead one who imported the phenomenon of 'Ndrangheta, in northern Italy. He was the man who, during the building boom years in Piedmont, imposed the rule of labor building throughout Val di Susa. Over the years in the 1960s and 1970s, his power in Piedmont, engrossed similar to that of Antonio Macri in Calabria. He had the hegemony on the Val di Susa territory, with his cousin Don Ciccio Francesco Mazzaferro. During the building boom years before, and the kidnapping-murder Ceretto then, Lo Presti had the absolute power in the construction industry and underworld in Piedmont until 1975, when he was sent into internal exile on the island of Asinara. In the history of the 'Ndrangheta infiltration in Piedmont, between 1965 and 1975, he was investigated several times. Related to the Mazzaferro crime family of Marina di Gioiosa Ionica, of which he was an important exponent, he moved to Piedmont in the late 1950s by the subalpine town. He turned reverently many politicians during election campaigns. He had ties with the clan of Marseille and with all the major crime families of Calabria and Sicily. He entertained friendly relations with Don Mico Domenico Tripodo, when he was in soggiorno obbligato (coerced stay) in Avigliana. Tripodo's presence was frequently reported in BardonecchiaDelitti e mafia Stampa Sera June 6, 1975. He also had contacts with Don Giovanni Stilo of Africo, the Calabrian priest who was repeatedly accused of collusion with the 'Ndrangheta, on the occasion of the adjustment of the Ceretto trial. He has had ties to the Sicilian and American mafia. Luciano Liggio, Salvatore Inzerillo, Frank Coppola (mobster), Gerlando Alberti, the Gambino crime family of New York and the families of the 'Ndrangheta in Canada. According to a witness of justice, in recent years, the relationship with his cousins, the Mazzaferro crime family, has cracked, and Lo Presti has approached and allied with the Aquinos, rivals of the Mazzaferro. Biography Lo Presti was born in Marina di Gioiosa Ionica. At the age of 16, he left Calabria and moved to Piedmont. In 1957 he was arrested in Casale Monferrato for selling counterfeit money. In 1963 he was sent to stay in soggiorno obbligato in Bardonecchia and booming construction puts on a small construction company. In September of the same year, Mario Corino, unionist and future mayor of Bardonecchia was attacked and beaten at night by strangers. The police arrested for the attack, two Calabrian workers. Francesco Ursino, brother-in-law of Lo Presti, and Antonio Zucco, originally from Cimin√†. Questioned by the judge, the two declared to have beaten Corino, because he was an Italian Labor Union spy. Lo Presti had been the instigatorL'aggressione di Bardonecchia non ha avuto movente politico La Stampa September 8, 1963. In 1965 he was arrested in Geneva by the Swiss gendarmery, with Alberto Re, an entrepreneur of Bardonecchia, for a series of thefts in the villas. They were arrested for the last shot they took. Theft of 60 million jewels inside a judge's villa. He was tried and sentenced to two years imprisonmentImpresario di Bardonecchia arrestato per furto di 60 milioni di gioielli in una villa a Ginevra La Stampa July 29, 1965. In 1968, Lo Presti returned to Bardonecchia and married a compaesana in one of the most luxurious hotels in the city, the Grand Hotel Riky. Among the guests, the well-known American boss Frank Coppola (mobster) known as Frank Tree Fingers and the Gambinos of Cherry Hill, New Jersey. In December 1969 he was suspected as the instigator of the Timpano murder. At Exilles, along the Val di Susa provincial road, the body of Vincenzo Timpano was found. He was killed by Giuseppe Oppedisano, his brother-in-law. The body was sprinkled with gasoline and set on fire. The Alfa Romeo 1750 owned by Lo Presti was found at the scene of the crime. Oppedisano confessed, but he never revealed the motive. Lo Presti instead had an unassailable alibi.

In June 1970, just six months later, he was again suspected as the instigator of the D'Aguanno murder. The body of Luigi D'Aguanno was found in an abandoned landfill at Moncalieri, a professional fence just released from prison. Someone said he paid a tip to the police with his life. The police arrested for the murder, Carmine Messina on the car owned by Lo Presti.

From laborer to \\"godfather\\" of Bardonecchia In 1970, Lo Presti began his rise in construction and entered into business relationships with the Sicilians. They were present for some time in Bardonecchia belonging to the Sicilian mafia families of Gambino, Di Maggio, Spatola and Inzerillo crime family of Passo di Rigano, a neighborhood in Palermo. Lo Presti very soon entered into business relations with the brothers Salvatore and Alfonso Gambino, direct cousins with the Gambinos of Cherry Hill, New Jersey, and distant cousins of the Gambino crime family of New York City, New York. They became his loyal employees in the recruitment and exploitation of labor building. He then joined in friendly relations with their cousin, the young Totuccio Salvatore Inzerillo, the future boss of Palermo, still early in his criminal career. On May 1, 1971, on Workers' Day in a bar in Turin, a group of Calabrese immigrants engaged in a gunfight. One of whom was Carmelo Manti who left four dead on the ground. They were arms merchants who demanded payment of a bribe which Manti owed them almost 2 million lire. Among the dead was Giuseppe Prochilo. He was a boss of the building racket and the Lo Presti's right-hand man. This massacre lifted the veil and broke the silence in the building racket. Manti, revealed information on the racket. He revealed tenders and subcontracts, exploitation, bribes. He revealed the names of the bosses who controlled the racket. Among the names there was also that of Rocco Lo Presti. Turin discovered an organization sprouted on the misery and suffering of many immigrantsQuattro calabresi uccisi a Torino La Stampa May 3, 1971Nella strage di piazza Vittorio una drammatica denuncia del racket La Stampa May 4, 1971. The attention of the newspapers and the judiciary concentrated on Bardonecchia. Through threats, intimidation and abuse of all kinds, he had managed to control the construction workforce in Val di SusaCommissione antimafia indagher√† sugli abusi edilizi a Bardonecchia La Stampa May 6, 1973Duro colpo alla mafia dell'edilizia La Stampa October 1¬∫, 1973Lavoratori senza libretto, condannato l'impresario Stampa Sera December 22, 1973. In January 1972 a group of armed Calabrese workers surrounded a construction site ordering the workers to be evacuated and never be seen again. The job thus passed to Lo Presti. However, when the magistrate began the interrogations, no one remembered anything. Leonardo Ferrero, reporter of l‚ÄôUnit√†, who was doing a service on building speculation in Val di Susa was threatened by Lo Presti. The Labor Union was also threatened. The mayor of Bardonecchia, Mario Corino, reported Lo Presti to be a mobsterNoi mafiosi? Siamo onesti lavoratori perseguitati per motivi elettorali La Stampa April 23, 1974. In May 1972, Giovanni Rosace said, in Bardonecchia was an intense traffic of arms and precious items coming from Marseilles controlled by Lo PrestiIl traffico d'armi e preziosi con la Francia passerebbe per le cosche della Val di Susa La Stampa April 4, 1974. In the same period, a report by the carabinieri claimed that Lo Presti controlled five clandestine gambling dens in Turin.

Together they dominated the field of gaining lucrative contracts such as the construction of the Fr√©jus Road Tunnel. They started with illegal hiring, abusive exploitation of workers and racket in yards. Through threats and intimidation they were able to control the labor building in Val di Susa. Developing ties and later exile In 1973 the Interpol reported the presence of Lo Presti in New York. For his stay in the United States, he was a guest with his wife and daughter of the Gambinos of Cherry Hill, New Jersey. The brothers John, Joseph and Rosario Gambino, cousins of Salvatore Inzerillo and distant cousins of Carlo Gambino. A photo showed Lo Presti sitting at a banquet table with Don Carlo GambinoLa mafia si preparava ad impadronirsi di lavori del Frejus La Stampa 4 aprile 1974. He was also present in Canada, first in Ontario and tightened alliances with names of organized crime in Toronto. Rocco Zito, Mike Racco, Cosimo Stalteri, Jimmy De Leo, Remo Commisso and Nick Coluccio. He then went to Montreal, Quebec and side with Vic Cotroni and Paul Violi. In January 1975, a mafia summit in Bardonecchia called the Criminalpol was a meeting between Calabrian and Sicilian mobsters took place. Mobsters from the US were also expected, but they abandoned at the last moment, because of news of a possible police break-in. Instead, the baptism of the second child of Lo Presti occurredL'arrivo in forze della Criminalpol manda in fumo convegno mafioso La Stampa 7 Gennaio 1975. In the spring of the same year, Lo Presti returned to the United States again. He started building in Miami, Florida along with John Gambino and Salvatore Inzerillo, but on his return to Italy, the Parliamentary Antimafia Commission, drawn by the numerous articles in the newspaper, made an inspection on the territory of Bardonecchia, and confirmed the presence of organized crime, identifying Lo Presti as the 'Ndrangheta boss of the city. The then superintendent (police) of Turin, Emilio Santillo wrote a voluminous file, on the 'Ndrangheta infiltration in Val di Susa, that controlled the building industry with particular reference to Lo PrestiQuesti gli undici nomi dei boss di Bardonecchia Stampa Sera 3 Aprile 1974Ecco l'esplosivo dossier sulla mafia in Valle di Susa La Stampa 3 Aprile 1974. Due to the dossier in 1975, Lo Presti was accused of being the leader of the arms racket, and at the request of the chief prosecutor Bruno Caccia, the judge murdered by the 'Ndrangheta of Turin in 1983, Lo Presti was sentenced to three years in exile on the island of AsinaraLo Presti accompagnato dagli agenti all'Asinara La Stampa 15 ottobre 1975. On the island, he knew many mafia figures, Luciano Leggio, Tommaso Buscetta, Ignazio Pullar√† from Palermo, Giuseppe Di Cristina from Riesi, Rocco Gioffr√® from Seminara, Francesco Barbaro from Plat√¨. The kidnapping-murder Ceretto In February 1976 he was taken to Asinara because he was accused of being the instigator of the Mario Ceretto kidnapping-murder, a wealthy industrialist of Cuorgn√® found buried in a field in OrbassanoIndustriale rapito nei pressi di Torino La Stampa May 24, 1975. On May 23, 1975, Ceretto was kidnapped and found dead a week later in the abandoned field.

For the kidnapping they were also involved and arrested, Giuseppe Cosimo Ruga from Monasterace, Cosimo Metastasio from Stilo, Sebastiano Giampaolo, Giuseppe Calabr√≤, known as and Giuseppe Giorgi from San Luca, Raffaele La Scala from Locri and Venanzio Tripodo, son of Don Mico Domenico TripodoL'assassinio di Ceretto scopre i legami fra la mafia di Rivarolo e Bardonecchia La Stampa June 28, 1976In aula i 14 dell'Anonima sequestri La Stampa January 28, 1978. After the arrest of Lo Presti, the clans in Turin were reorganized. One by one the people close to Lo Presti were eliminated.

In July 1978, while the trial of the Ceretto murder was under way, Giuseppe Oppedisano, brother-in-law of Lo Presti, after nine years in jail for the Timpano murder, crowds of jealousy, went out of prison and killed his wife.

After many years, it was discovered that Lo Presti gave 30 million lire to a Vatican monsignor, Don Simeone Duca, for his intercession with the judge of the Supreme CourtL'oro del Vaticano di Claudio Rendina. It is said that Don Giovanni Stilo, the priest of Africo, gave him contact with Don Simeone Duca. In 1987 he was arrested for a fraud of three billion pounds to a bank of Cuneo, but that time he was acquitted of all chargesBancario minacciato paga 3 miliardi La Stampa November 26, 1987. In 1991, Lo Presti requested and obtained criminal rehabilitation. In 1993, nephew Giuseppe Ursino along with fifteen other people were arrested in Bardonecchia for the trafficking of arms and drugsDroga e traffico d'armi La Stampa April 29, 1993. Later years In 1991 Pierluigi Leone, chief police commissioner of Bardonecchia was suddenly transferred to Calabria without reason, just two months after his arrival. Leone had touched strong political interests in Bardonecchia, was investigating the future realization of the Campo Smith complex and had written an investigative report on Lo Presti and proposed a measure of prevention against him. Lo Presti himself had threatened him and made him understand that he was aware of confidential inquiries about himTroppo zelante fu trasferito il commissario che indagava su Campo Smith La Stampa February 6, 1996. In 1995 Lo Presti was re-arrested because of his involvement in the deal Campo Smith. The construction of a mega residence, located in Campo Smith, at the foot of the ski resorts. An investment of 50 billion lire was the biggest work ever made in Bardonecchia after the Fr√©jus Road Tunnel. According to the indictment Lo Presti was the head of the organization that handled the entire Campo Smith operation. Alessandro Gibello, the mayor of Bardonecchia was arrested, involved in the investigation of all officials of the municipality for alleged constraints due to the organized crime. The carabinieri marshal of Bardonecchia was also investigated. All the biggest construction sites in the Bardonecchia were seized by the magistrate and was also involved and arrested Gaetano Belfiore, brother of the well-known boss of the 'Ndrangheta transplanted in Turin, Domenico Mimmo Belfiore. On May 5, 1995, by decree of the government, the council of Bardonecchia was the first and only municipality in northern Italy dissolved for alleged mafia infiltrationBardonecchia comune chiuso per mafia La Stampa April 22, 1995. The Court seized property and assets to Lo Presti worth 10 billion lire. In April 2001, during the trial Campo Smith, a government witness, said in prison by a certain Musuraci detained in Spain, of a possible Lo Presti involvement, together with the Belfiore and Ursini crime families, in the murder of the Turin chief prosecutor, Bruno Caccia. However, there was not evidence of a direct role of Lo Presti in that murder and no charges stuck. Also the government witnesses, Giacomo Lauro and Francesco Fonti, declared to the judges of the Turin Court, of the existence in Bardonecchia, of a locale of 'Ndrangheta, headed by Rocco Lo Presti and Francesco Mazzaferro, which dated back to the 1970s. The government witness from Palermo, Francesco Lo Vecchio, claimed that Lo Presti and Mazzaferro, were involved together with other Calabrese, in a large traffic of cocaine from Colombia. But even in this case, the investigators never managed to obtain evidence against Lo PrestiMafias on the Move: How Organized Crime Conquers New Territories of Federico Varese. The rise of the Ursino nephews From 2000 onwards the criminal structures in Bardonecchia changed. Due to constant pressure from the judiciary and law enforcement agencies, Lo Presti was forced to cede the command scepter to his nephews, the brothers Luciano and Giuseppe Ursino. With this move, Lo Presti hoped to draw less attention to himself. Convinced then, from so many years of impunity, that in the event of judicial troubles, at most they could forbid him to leave Bardonecchia, the law that established the obligatory stay, in the place of residence. The nephew, Luciano Ursino, very soon entered into business relations with the brothers Adolfo and Aldo Cosimo Crea, emerging bosses of the 'Ndrangheta of Turin, with a videopoker tour, trimming gaming machines to as many merchants as possible, from Bardonecchia to Turin. In 2003, on the eve of the 2006 Winter Olympic Games in Turin, he began to talk about tenders in Val di Susa. The works aroused the interest of the Lo Presti 'ndrina. The first threats arrived. The Works Director of the Turin-Bardonecchia highway (Autostrada A32), and the Turin Agency for 2006 Winter Olympics, received envelopes with bullets. The Ursinos managed to bribe a police inspector who informed them about the investigation and gave them a scanner to find bugs. In April 2004, the Ursinos approached a politician to try to obtain European Union funding, and set up a millionaire wear ring, that extended from Bardonecchia to Turin. Among the victims strangled by usury, there was a well- known political figure, who denounced the organization, and in November 2006 Rocco Lo Presti was arrested along with his nephews UrsinosL'usuraio arrivava da Bardonecchia La Stampa November 7, 2006Gli Ursino i nipoti del boss La Stampa October 6, 2008Gli Ursino puntavano ai fondi di Bruxelles La Stampa October 6, 2008. The Court seized again assets to him worth 2 million euros. Lo Presti spent the last period of life moving from one hospital to another. Lo Presti died of a heart attack on January 23, 2009 in the Department detainment of the Molinette Hospital in Turin at the age of 72, the day after he was sentenced to six years for criminal association with the mafia.Rocco Lo Presti il padrino della Val di Susa La Stampa 24 gennaio 2009 Few attended his funeral for fear of police checks.

The film stars Emma Roberts, Dave Franco and Juliette Lewis, and revolves around an online objective truth or dare online game, which allows people to enlist as \\"players\\" or \\"watchers\\" and as the game progresses further, the players are contacted and invited to participate in more dangerous and risky dares than their prior ones. The film premiered at the SVA Theater on July 12, 2016 and was theatrically released on July 27, 2016, by Lionsgate. Nerve received praise for its energy and the chemistry of its cast, and grossed over $85 million worldwide against a $19 million budget.  Plot High school senior Venus \\"Vee\\" Delmonico longs to leave Staten Island for college, but is avoiding telling her mother as they are still mourning the death of her older brother. Her friend Sydney becomes popular in Nerve: an online reality game of truth and dare, but without the truth element - where people either enlist as \\"players\\" or register to watch as \\"watchers\\". Players accept dares as they're invited by watchers and receive monetary rewards if they successfully complete those dares. Watchers in turn pay to spectate as the players attempt their challenges. Sydney chastises Vee's unadventurous nature so Vee signs up as a player. There are three basic rules: all dares must be recorded on the player's phone, earned money will be revoked if a player fails or bails on a dare, and that \\"snitches get stitches.\\" Vee's first dare is to kiss a stranger at a diner. Told to kiss Ian, she completes this, to which Ian dances and sings to Vee, revealing he's another player on a dare. The next challenge requires Ian to take Vee to Manhattan on his motorcycle. There, they are given another task, wherein they are dared to try on expensive formal attire. Their street clothes are stolen and the watchers dare them to leave the store. Unwilling to be caught stealing, they flee in their undergarments. They return to Ian's motorbike where they find the expensive clothes, which have been paid for by an unknown benefactor. Vee is dared to get a tattoo chosen by Ian, and Ian is then dared to ride his motorbike through the city blindfolded at 60 mph, using Vee to steer his body; once completed, the two kiss. Vee and Ian become among Nerves top players. Jealous of Vee's popularity, Sydney accepts a dare at a party to cross a ladder between two buildings. Sydney bails and is eliminated from the game. Vee catches Sydney making out with J.P., a boy Vee likes, and the two have a major argument. Tommy reveals that he was watching Ian's profile; Ian had accepted a request to make Vee and Sydney fight. Vee completes the ladder challenge herself. Realizing that game players could die, she reports the game to a policeman but he doesn‚Äôt believe her. Having broken the third rule requiring that snitchers get punished, all the money in her family‚Äôs bank accounts vanish. Highly ranked player Ty accepts a dare to knock her unconscious. Vee wakes up in a shipping container with \\"snitches get stitches\\" on the walls. She escapes and finds Ian, who confesses that he and Ty were players whose friend was accidentally killed in a dare. When they tried to alert the authorities, their families' jobs, bank accounts, and identities were stolen by the watchers. Vee has now joined them in the secret third category of the game: \\"prisoners\\". If a prisoner can reach and win the day‚Äôs final round, they regain everything. Vee, Tommy, and Sydney recruit Tommy's hacker friends to alter the game's online code, but it is impossible to simply shut down Nerve, as all the watchers phones act as a distributed server. Vee and Ian earn the two spots in the final dare, which takes place at Battery Weed. The winner will be whoever shoots the other with the handguns they‚Äôve been given. Ian offers her the win, but when she also refuses to shoot, Ty jumps from the audience to take Ian's place and shoots her, and she dies in Ian's arms. Suddenly, Tommy and his hackers modify Nerves source code to decrypt the watcher's code names and send them all a message: \\"You are an accessory to murder\\", accompanied by each watcher's real name. All the audience members immediately log out, closing down the game's servers and effectively ending it. Ian aims his gun at Ty, but Vee reveals that she and Ty had staged her murder to scare the watchers into disbanding Nerve. Ty explains the weapon was loaded with blanks and he was, in fact, conspiring with the hackers. Tommy's hacker friends restore the stolen money and identities. A few months later, Vee and Sydney have reconciled, Ian finally reveals to Vee that his real name is Samuel Winner, Vee and Ian/Sam are a couple and Vee is attending CalArts.  Cast   Production  Directors Ariel Schulman and Henry Joost had previously dealt with similar themes in their documentary Catfish. On their attraction to a film based around the Internet, they stated, \\"Most things aren‚Äôt black and white. The Internet is neither good nor bad; it just depends on how you use it\\", giving the example that the Nerve game could be both \\"a really empowering game, and it‚Äôs also the most awful thing that you can possibly imagine\\". The directors strived for a PG-13 rating, with Schulman stating \\"we wanted to make sure that younger teenagers could see it. We think it has an important message and they‚Äôll dig it\\", with Joost adding \\"We weren‚Äôt interested in making a gross torture movie\\". In trying to keep the rating down, the directors axed a \\"sex dare\\" that \\"was ultimately just too dark and weird\\". The film has also a lighter ending and theme than the book, as the novel deals with a much darker plot and ending. The team stated that the fast- changing nature of the Internet made it a tough subject to make a narrative feature about, with Joost noting that the app Periscope came out during the film development, which Joost called \\"like half-way to being Nerve\\". In January 2015, it was announced that Emma Roberts and Dave Franco were set to star in the film. In April 2015, it was announced that Kimiko Glenn had joined the cast of the film, portraying the role of Emma Roberts' character's worried friend. The same day, it was announced that rapper Colson \\"Machine Gun Kelly\\" Baker had also joined the cast.  Filming  Principal photography on the film began in 2015, in New York City. Production on the film concluded on June 5, 2015.  Release  The film premiered at the School of Visual Arts in New York City on July 12, where the cast attended. It was also screened on July 21 at Comic-Con. The film was originally scheduled for September 16, 2016, but was eventually theatrically released on July 27, 2016. Reception Box office Nerve grossed $38.6 million in the United States and Canada, and $46.5 million in other countries, for a worldwide total of $85.2 million, against a budget of $19 million. The film was projected to gross around $10 million in its opening weekend and $15 million over its first five days from 2,538 theaters. The film grossed $3.7 million on its opening day and ended up finishing 8th at the box office in its opening weekend, grossing $9.4 million (a five-day total of $15.5 million). Critical response On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 67% based on 138 reviews, with an average rating of 5.78/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Nerves fast pace and charming leads help overcome a number of fundamental flaws, adding up to a teen-friendly thriller with enough energy to occasionally offset its muddled execution.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 58 out of 100 based on 33 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"A‚àí\\" on an A+ to F scale. Scott Tobias of Uproxx wrote, \\"Though the ending surrenders to a tsk-tsk-ing morality play that turns on the mob the game (and the film) has so smartly orchestrated, Nerve is the rare virtual thriller that understands how social media actually works and the addictive little subcultures that can spin out of it.\\" Dave Palmer of The Reel Deal gave the film 7/10, saying, \\"It is a lot of fun, and not even in a turn-your-brain off kind of way. The film actually has some smart things to say about teenagers, their phones and what people will do to get internet famous and it is all delivered in a colorful little package.\\" Accolades The film was nominated at the People's Choice Awards in the category \\"Favorite Thriller Movie\\". Legacy Nerve has been mentioned in relation to the real-life dare game called Blue Whale Challenge, which attracted media attention starting from 2016 and shares some similarities with what's depicted in the film.

The Blob was a large mass of relatively warm water in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of North America that was first detected in late 2013 and continued to spread throughout 2014 and 2015. It is an example of a marine heatwave. Sea surface temperatures indicated that The Blob persisted into 2016, but it was initially thought to have dissipated later that year. By September 2016, \\"The Blob\\" resurfaced and made itself known to meteorologists. The warm water mass was unusual for open ocean conditions and is considered to have played a role in the formation of the unusual weather conditions experienced along the Pacific coast of North America during the same time period. The warm waters of the Blob were nutrient-poor and adversely affected marine life. Origin The Blob was first detected in the autumn of 2013 and the early months of 2014 by Nicholas Bond of the Joint Institute for the Study of the Atmosphere and Ocean of the University of Washington, and his colleagues, when a large circular body of sea-water did not cool as expected and remained much warmer than the average normal temperatures for that location and season. Bond, then the State Climatologist for Washington, coined the term \\"The Blob\\", with the term first appearing in an article in the monthly newsletter of the Office of the Washington State Climatologist for June 2014. Description The three \\"blobs\\" of warm water can be seen off the North American coast, ranging from Alaska to Mexico, seen in this graphic dated 1 September 2014. Initially the Blob was reported as being wide and deep. It later expanded and reached a size of long, wide, and deep, in the month of June 2014 when the term \\"The Blob\\" was coined. The Blob now hugs the coast of North America from Mexico to Alaska and beyond, stretching more than , and has formed three distinct patches: the first, off the coast of Canada, Washington, Oregon, and northern California, a region known to oceanographers as the Coastal Upwelling Domain; the second in the Bering Sea off the coast of Alaska; and the third and smallest off the coast of southern California and Mexico. In February 2014, the temperature of the Blob was around warmer than what was usual for the time of year. A NOAA scientist noted in September 2014 that, based on ocean temperature records, the North Pacific Ocean had not previously experienced temperatures so warm since climatologists began taking measurements. Cause The immediate cause of the phenomenon was the lower than normal rates of heat loss from the sea to the atmosphere, compounded with lower than usual water circulation resulting in a static upper layer of water. Both of these are attributed to a static high pressure region in the atmosphere, termed the Ridiculously Resilient Ridge, which has existed since spring 2014. The lack of air movement impacts the wind-forced currents and the wind-generated stirring of surface waters. These in turn have influenced the weather in the Pacific Northwest from the winter of 2013‚Äì2014 onwards and may have been associated with the unusually hot summer experienced in the continental Pacific Northwest in 2014. The reason for the phenomenon remains unclear. Some experts consider that the wedge of warm water portends a cyclical change with the surface waters of the mid-latitude Pacific Ocean flipping from a cold phase to a warm phase in a cycle known as the Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO). This poorly-understood change happens at irregular intervals of years or decades. During a warm phase, the west Pacific becomes cooler and part of the eastern ocean warms; during the cool phase, these changes reverse. Scientists believe a cold phase started in the late 1990s and the arrival of the Blob may be the start of the next warm phase. The PDO phases may also be related to the likelihood of El Nino events. NASA climatologist William Patzert predicts that if the PDO is at work here, there will be widespread climatological consequences and southern California and the American South may be in for a period of high precipitation, with an increase in the rate of global warming. Another climatologist, Matt Newman of the University of Colorado, does not think the Blob fits the pattern of a shift in the PDO. He believes the unusually warm water is due to the persistent area of high pressure stationary over the northeastern Pacific Ocean. Dan Cayan of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography is unsure about the ultimate cause of the phenomenon, but states \\"there's no doubt that this anomaly in sea surface temperature is very meaningful\\". Effects Ecosystem disruption Sea surface temperature anomalies are a physical indicator which adversely affect the zooplankton (mainly copepods) in the Northeast Pacific and specifically in the Coastal Upwelling Domain. Warm waters are much less nutrient-rich than the cold upwelling waters which were the norm till recently off the Pacific Coast. This results in reduced phytoplankton productivity with knock on effects on the zooplankton which feed on it and the higher levels of the food chain. Species lower in the food web that prefer colder waters, which tend to be fattier were replaced by warmer water species of lower nutritional value. The Northwest Fisheries Science Center, Seattle predicted reduced catches of coho and Chinook salmon, a major contributing factor being the raised temperatures of seawater in the Blob. Salmon catches dropped as the fish migrated away having found low levels of zooplankton. Thousands of sea lion pups are starving in California leading to forced beachings. Thousands of Cassin's auklets in Oregon have starved due to lack of food. Animals which favour warm waters and which have never been seen as far north as Alaska, have been spotted, examples being the warm water thresher sharks (Alopias spp) and ocean sunfish (Mola mola). In the spring of 2016, acres of Velella velella were reported in the waters south of the Copper River Delta. The discovery of a skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis), primarily a fish of warm tropical waters, off Copper River, in Alaska, north of the previous geographic limit, and a dead sooty storm-petrel (Oceanodroma tristrami), a species native to Northern Asia and Hawaii, along with a few brown boobies (Sula leucogaster) in the Farallon Islands of California, besides other such records, has led to worries amongst marine biologists that the food web across the Pacific is in danger of disruption. Biologists from The University of Queensland observed the first ever mass bleaching event for Hawaiian coral reefs in 2014, and attributed it to the blob. Weather and seasons Research from the University of Washington found positive temperature anomalies in the NE Pacific Ocean (upper ~100 m, greater than 2.5 ¬∞C, with temperatures at the coast below normal) for the winter period of 2013‚Äì2014. Heat loss from the ocean during the winter time was suppressed. During spring and summer 2014 the warmer sea surface temperature anomalies reached coastal waters. The anomaly may have had a significant effect on the unusually warm summer of 2014, with record high temperatures over parts of land in the Pacific Northwest. Offshore sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the NE Pacific for the month of February were the greatest at least since the 1980s, possibly as early as 1900. Additionally they found anomalous sea surface pressure SSP, with a peak magnitude approaching 10 hPa, a record high value for the years of 1949‚Äì2014. Canadian senior climatologist David Phillips noted in May 2015 about the coming winter season, \\"If that blob continues, if it stays warm ... and then you add to that El Nino, it may complement each other and then it may be the year winter is cancelled.\\" See also *Cold blob (North Atlantic) *Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate References Oceanography Pacific Ocean Anomalous weather ","title":"The Blob (Pacific Ocean)"},{"id":"46533104","text":"Deanne Meek is an American operatic mezzo-soprano who has had an active international career since the mid 1990s.

The organization eventually merged with the Workers' Committee for a Good Peace formed by Anton Drexler to become the German Workers' Party in January 1919. Ultimately these principles would develop into the National Socialist German Workers Party (Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei; NSDAP), also known as the Nazi Party. Background Germany‚Äôs defeat in World War I forced them to take complete responsibility for the war, completely humiliating the German people. Additionally, the stab-in-the-back myth or the idea that Germany was actually winning the war and was undermined by domestic revolutions, emerged and added anger to the equation. The Thule Society, an organization encompassing people from all classes centered around hopes for a counterrevolution, emerged as a result of German humiliation and anger and attempted to fill the gap felt by Germans that the Weimar Republic was ‚Äúout of touch,‚Äù with lower classes. The society approached Karl Harrer, a member and sports reporter for the right-wing publication M√ºnchner-Augsburger Abendzeitung, to start a political activist group in Munich. The hope was to collect discuss critical German principles, namely nationalism and anti- Semitism.} Ideology Politischer Arbeiter-Zirkel met periodically for about a year, generally in a small group of three to seven consistent members. Members shared a similar and traditional outlook as highly nationalist, anti- Marxist and anti-Semitic. They also discussed emerging ideas of the time such as Jews as the enemy to Germany, various aspects of the defeat of World War I, and anti-English sentiment, generally thought to be brought on by the Treaty of Versailles. During the meetings Harrer lead the group in studying the Russian Revolution in hopes of finding an escape for Germany. Future of the Club Anton Drexler met Karl Harrer at a Rightist rally in Wagner Hall in Munich in 1918.} Harrer was impressed with Drexler‚Äôs desire to have citizen representation in the political sphere and Drexler began attending meetings.} Drexler was the leader of his own political group known as the Workers' Committee for a Good Peace, consisting mostly of Drexler‚Äôs railway coworkers. The Workers' Committee was united under beliefs that international capitalists, considered to be Jews, and Marxists were the enemy. While Harrer believed there was something to be said for keeping the Politischer Arbeiter- Zirkel small and secretive, Drexler wanted to have a bigger audience and work on the spread of his ideals. Drexler wanted to make it a political party. Ultimately, Drexler proposed the creation of the German Workers' Party. With the uniting of the Politischer Arbeiter-Zirkel with the Workers' Committee, the German Workers' Party (Deutsche Arbeiterpartei; DAP) was founded. Besides Drexler and Harrer, founding members included Gottfried Feder and Dietrich Eckart. It met for the first time on January 5, 1919 in the hotel F√ºrstenfelder Hof in Munich. Drexler's vision for the party increasingly came into conflict with Harrer's. Harrer wished to ensure that an elite 'inner circle' remained in control of the party, while Drexler wanted to expand it into a mass movement. When Adolf Hitler joined the party, Drexler's position was strengthened. Hitler and Drexler worked on a new constitution to marginalise the role of the Politischer Arbeiter-Zirkel. Harrer was outvoted, and resigned from the party. The DAP was renamed the National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei; NSDAP) on February 24, 1920.

The film follows two brothers (Chris Pine and Ben Foster) who carry out a series of bank robberies to save their family ranch, while being pursued by two Texas Rangers (Jeff Bridges and Gil Birmingham). The film premiered at the Un Certain Regard section of the 2016 Cannes Film Festival on May 16, 2016, and was theatrically released in the United States on August 12, 2016, to critical acclaim, particularly for Bridges' performance, the screenplay, and the editing. It also grossed $37 million. The American Film Institute selected it as one of its ten Movies of the Year, and it was nominated for numerous awards, including four Oscar nominations at the 89th Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Supporting Actor (Bridges), Best Original Screenplay and Best Film Editing. It also received Golden Globe nominations for Best Picture, Best Supporting Actor for Bridges and Best Screenplay.  Plot  In West Texas, divorced father Toby Howard (Chris Pine) and his ex-con older brother Tanner (Ben Foster) carry out early morning robberies of two branches of the Texas Midlands Bank. Though the robberies are well-planned, Tanner's wild nature leads him to take unnecessary risks, frustrating Toby. Back on the family ranch, they bury their getaway car in a pit with an excavator. The brothers' mother has died after a long illness, leaving their ranch in debt because of a reverse mortgage provided by the Texas Midlands Bank. If the debt is not paid off in a few days, the ranch will be foreclosed. Oil has been discovered on their land, and Toby is determined to ensure a comfortable life for his estranged sons. They rob Texas Midlands as a form of frontier justice. Two Texas Rangers, Marcus Hamilton (Jeff Bridges) and Alberto Parker (Gil Birmingham), are on the case. Hamilton, who is close to retirement, investigates the robberies and quickly determines the brothers' methods and personalities. Meanwhile, Tanner robs another bank while Toby unknowingly waits at a nearby diner, conversing with a waitress. They take the stolen money to an Indian casino in Oklahoma to be laundered. Toby has the casino convert their gambling winnings into a check made out to the Texas Midlands Bank. With untraceable funds and gambling as a cover for how they were acquired, the brothers head back to Texas. Hamilton stakes out another branch of the Texas Midlands Bank, to no avail. During that time, Hamilton playfully makes fun of his partner‚Äôs half-Mexican and half-Indian heritage; Parker retorts with jokes about Hamilton's age. Hamilton figures a pattern to the bank robberies and determines the next target. Hamilton and Parker are en route to the bank when the final robbery occurs. Pressed for time, the brothers proceed with the heist though the bank is crowded. A shoot- out ensues when a security guard and an armed civilian fire at the brothers and Tanner kills both. Toby is shot in the abdomen as they are ambushed by a waiting posse of armed townspeople outside the bank. The brothers race out of town with the local posse in pursuit. After gaining some distance, Tanner stops and fires an automatic rifle, forcing the posse to retreat. The brothers split; Toby takes the money using another vehicle, while Tanner creates a diversion. He draws the lawmen off the trail to a desert mountain ridge where he takes potshots at the police with a hunting rifle, killing Parker. Distraught, Hamilton uses a local resident and posse member's knowledge of the area to circle behind Tanner. He gets into a shooting position behind Tanner, and kills him. During the standoff, Toby conceals his wound, passes through a police checkpoint without incident, and launders the stolen cash at the casino, where he sees the news report of his brother's death. He takes the casino's check to the bank just in time to avoid the ranch's foreclosure and deeds the ranch into a family trust. After retirement, Hamilton visits his former office to learn that the Rangers have cleared Toby as a suspect, as his record is clean and he has no motive to steal since the new oil wells earn more in a month than the total stolen in all of the robberies together. The money from the ranch's oil wells is deposited at the Texas Midlands Bank, which refuses to co-operate with the investigation for fear of losing management of the family's trust fund. Hamilton visits Toby's ranch. Although they stay civil, Hamilton states that he knows Toby masterminded and took part in the robberies, but wishes to know the reason. Toby says he has resolved not to let poverty affect his sons like it affected him and Tanner. Hamilton tells Toby he holds him responsible for the death of his partner, and just as a Mexican standoff starts to occur, they are interrupted when Toby's ex-wife and children arrive. The ranch belongs to the trust and thus to them; Toby is only there to visit and fix up the house. As Hamilton departs, Toby suggests they meet again soon to \\"finish the conversation\\" and \\"bring you some peace\\". Hamilton says he would like to meet again and maybe he will \\"bring some peace\\" to Toby. Hamilton leaves, without giving Toby any absolution.

It is a prickly shrub whose leaves have a distinct mid-vein on the lower surface and which has heads of pinkish white flowerheads in early spring.fruitRavensthorpe Description Melaleuca torquata is a densely foliaged shrub with rough bark, growing to about tall. Its leaves are usually arranged alternately and are long and wide, narrow oval to egg-shaped with a prominent mid-vein producing a keel on the lower surface of the leaf. The end of the leaf tapers to a very fine point making the shrub very prickly. The stamens of the flowers are white but the petals are pink or red. The flowers are arranged in heads or short spikes on the ends of branches which continue to grow after flowering and sometimes also in the upper leaf axils. The heads are up to in diameter and contain 4 to 11 individual flowers. The petals are long and fall off as the flower ages. The stamens are arranged in five bundles around the flowers and there are 3 to 13 stamens per bundle. The main flowering period is in September and October and is followed by fruit which are woody capsules long forming loose clusters along the stems. Taxonomy and naming Melaleuca torquata was first formally described in 1988 by Bryan Barlow in Australian Systematic Botany. The specific epithet (torquata) is from the Latin words torquatus meaning \\"adorned with a neck chain or collar\\" in reference to the top of the fruits which looks like a crown. Distribution and habitat Melaleuca torquata occurs in and between the Katanning, Stirling Range and Cape Arid districts in the Avon Wheatbelt, Esperance Plains, Jarrah Forest and Mallee biogeographic regions. It grows in clayey or sandy loam on undulating plains and in winter-wet depressions.

The first ortholog of this protein was discovered in humans. Subsequently, through the use of algorithms and bioinformatics, homologs of C1orf131 have been discovered in numerous species, and as a result, the name of the majority of the proteins in this protein family is Uncharacterized protein C1orf131 homolog. Gene In humans C1orf131 is located on the minus strand of chromosome 1 and on the cytogenetic band 1q42.2 along with 193 other genes. Notably, the gene upstream of C1orf131 is GNPAT, and the gene downstream of C1orf131 is TRIM67. When this gene is transcribed in humans, C1orf131 most often forms an mRNA of 1458 base pairs long which is composed of seven exons. There are at least nine others alternative splice forms in humans that produce proteins. They range in size from 129 base pairs (2 exons) to 1458 base pairs (7 exons). Protein In the C1orf131 protein family, the proteins are between 93 and 450 amino acids long; however, the majority tend to be between 160-295 amino acids long. They have a molecular weight between 10.6 and 49.0 kDa with the majority between 18.6 and 32.7 kDa. They have an isoelectric point between 9.6 and 11.2. Over 30 orthologs from mammals, birds and lizards have been identified as having a poly(A) RNA binding site. All orthologs in this protein family have a domain of unknown function DUF4602. The human protein has been shown to be both phosphorylated and acetylated. These proteins are lysines rich, charged amino acids (DEHKR), and basic charged amino acids (HKR). The secondary structure of these proteins primarily consist of alpha helices and coils with a small percentage of beta strands. C1orf131 has been shown to interact with ubiquitin through affinity capture followed by mass spectrometry and APP (amyloid beta (A4) precursor protein) through reconstituted complex. Graphical overview of the human protein C1orf131 with DUF4602 shown in green, phosphorylation in red points, and acetylation in gray point. DUF4602 DUF4602 (PF15375) is generally 120+ amino acids long. There is typically only one gene that contains this DUF domain;however, the DUF domain has been identified in two different proteins in several species. In Trichuris suis DUF4602 is found in both hypothetical protein M5114_09117 and tRNA pseudouridine synthase D, and in Echinocuccus granulosus DUF4602 has been found in hypothetical protein EGR 05135 and expressed conserved protein. DUF4602 has been found primarily in eukaryotes; however, DUF4602 has been identified in the virus DRHN1, Bacillus sp. UNC41MFS5, Enterococcus faecalis, and Enterococcus faecalis 13-SD-W-01. In the C1orf131 orthologs the DUF domains are typically located in the middle of the gene toward the C-terminus side in larger proteins (250+ residues) and in smaller orthologs (160-250 residues) the DUF domain is located near the N-terminus. Also in larger orthologs there are regions of low complexity which could indicate that these proteins are intrinsically disordered proteins. Evolutionary history This gene family exists only in eukaryotes. There are no paralogs of this gene; however, there are a few pseudogenes of C1orf131. Thus far they have only been found in orangutans, mouse lemurs, and sloths. When this gene family is compared to cytochrome C, a slow evolving gene, and fibrinogen gamma chain, a fast evolving gene it is shown to evolve at a faster rate than fibrinogen.

The machine to be another  The \\"machine\\" is an open source system developed by BeAnotherLab which uses a head-mounted display to transmit video from one person's perspective to another. The specifications for the system, including software, are freely available. The most recent iteration of the project uses the Oculus Rift, a virtual reality headset. In the first project to use the system, one person plays the role of \\"user\\" and the other \\"performer\\". They each occupy separate but identical rooms, and as the user explores the room the performer follows their movements in real time. Because the user receives video from the performer's perspective, the user feels as though they are inhabiting the body of the performer. As they interact with objects in the room, the performer transmits personal thoughts to the user through headphones to create a furthered sense of intimacy. A member of BeAnotherLab, Phillip Betrand, said of the experiment, > \\"We believe this allows for a deeper experience for a user, knowing that > their point of view is that of an actual human being, and not a virtual > avatar. In the last year, we‚Äôve observed that subjects tend to demonstrate > empathetic feelings towards the performers they didn't have before.

Gender swap  Using a modified version of The Machine To Be Another system, Gender Swap allows a user to feel as though they are inhabiting the body of someone with a different gender from their own. The piece focuses on the interaction between the sense of touch and vision. Two users of different genders wear Oculus Rift headsets which transmit the view from the each other's perspective. The users synchronize their movements and run their hands along their bodies. By associating the visuals from each other's point of view with the sensation of being touched, the users are supposed to have the sensation of inhabiting each other's bodies. In April 2014, the project won a Learning, Sciences and Humanities award from Laval Virtual, an annual event focusing on virtual reality projects. It was also awarded an honorary mention at Ars Electronica. Because of the project's success, BeAnotherLab started a research collaboration with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in January 2015. In this collaboration they hope to further upgrade the hardware and software which comprise the Machine To Be Another, as well as to explore new social applications for the system.

The barrier-grid technique originated in the late 1890s, overlapping with the development of parallax stereography (Reli√®phographie) for 3D autostereograms. The technique has also been used for color-changing pictures, but to a much lesser extent. The development of barrier-grid technologies can also be regarded as a step towards lenticular printing, although the technique has remained after the invention of lenticular technologies as a relatively cheap and simple way to produce animated images in print.  Concept  Pattern that will produce a spinning cube Overlay  History  Henri de Toulouse Lautrec's cover of the new edition of \\"The Motograph Moving Picture Book\\" (1898) Using screens for photographic printing was suggested by William Fox Talbot as \\"photographic screens or veils\\" in an 1852 patent. This resulted in several halftone processes in the next decades. For color photography the use of colored line sheets had been suggested by Louis Arthur Ducos du Hauron in 1869. Several halftone printing and color photography processes, including the 1895 Joly colour screen with >0.1 mm RGB lines, inspired the use of line screens for autostereoscopic images.  Motograph  W. Symons received British Patent No. 5,759 on March 14, 1896 for a technique that was used about two years later for the oldest known publication that used a line-sheet to create the illusion of motion in pictures. The Motograph Moving Picture Book was published in London at the start of 1898 by Bliss, Sands & Co. It came with a \\"transparency\\" with black stripes to add the illusion of motion to the pictures in the book (13 in the original black and white edition and 23 in the later color edition). The illustrations were credited to \\"F.J. Vernay, Yorick, &c.;\\". The pictures feature different hatching patterns, causing moir√© type effects when the striped transparency is moved across it. It creates a vibrant type of motion illusion with revolving wheels, billowing smoke, ripples in water, etc. The expanded \\"new edition\\" of the book had a cover design \\"specially drawn for the book\\" by famous French painter Henri de Toulouse- Lautrec, depicting a woman viewing pictures with the transparency (accompanied by a girl, a man and three different pets).  Auguste Berthier's autostereograms  Berthier's diagram: A-B=glass plate, with a-b=opaque lines, P=Picture, O=Eyes, c-n=blocked and allowed views (Le Cosmos 05-1896) In May 1896 Auguste Berthier published an article about the history of stereoscopic images in French scientific magazine Le Cosmos, which included his method of creating an autostereogram.Berthier, Auguste (May 16 and 23, 1896). \\"Images st√©r√©oscopiques de grand format\\" (in French). Cosmos 34 (590, 591): 205‚Äì210, 227-233 (see 229‚Äì231) Alternating strips from the left and right image of a traditional stereoscopic negative had to be recomposed as an interlaced image, preferably during the printing of the image on paper. A glass plate with opaque lines had to be fixed in front of the interlaced print with a few millimeters in between, so the lines on the screen formed a parallax barrier: from the right distance and angle each eye could only see the photographic strips shot from the corresponding angle. The article was illustrated with a diagram of the principle, an image of the two parts of a stereoscopic photograph divided into exaggerated wide bands, and the same strips recomposed as an interlaced image. Berthier's idea was hardly noticed. After Frederic Ives' similar autostereograms were presented at the French Academy of Sciences in 1904, Berthier reminded the institute about his autostereograms that he in the meantime had also managed to create in color.  Frederic Ives' parallax stereogram & changeable picture  On December 5, 1901 American inventor Frederic Eugene Ives presented his \\"parallax stereogram\\" at the Franklin Institute of the State of Pennsylvania. He claimed that he first had the idea 16 years earlier while working with the line screen in a study of \\"the dioptrics of half-tone screen photography\\". At the time he didn't think it was important enough to spend his time on. In 1901 Ives realized that he could easily adapt his Kromolinoskop color photo camera to create the stereogram and thought it would be an interesting scientific novelty worthy of presentation at the Franklin Institute. The \\"parallax stereogram\\" was a photo shot through two apertures behind the lens with a \\"transparent-line screen, consisting of opaque lines with clear spaces between them\\" in front of the sensitive plate, slightly separated from it. The line screen had 200 parallel lines per inch () and was contact-printed from an original factory halftone screen. The technique received U.S. patent 725,567 on April 14, 1903 (application filed on September 25, 1902). On October 11, 1904 Ives received U.S. patent 771,824 (application filed on October 27, 1903) for a \\"Changeable sign, picture, &c.;\\". This was basically the same technique but with interlaced different images instead of a stereoscopic image. Shifting from one angle to the other, by passing the image or by a vibration of the image, the image would change from one to the other.  Eug√®ne Estanave's animated autostereograms  In 1904 L√©on Gaumont came across Ives' pictures at the World's Fair in St. Louis and had them presented at the French Academy of Sciences in October and the Soci√©t√© Fran√ßaise de Physique in November. Gaumont gave two parallax stereograms to the Conservatoire national des arts et m√©tiers in 1905 and two others became part of the collection of the Soci√©t√© fran√ßaise de photographie. French mathematician Eug√®ne Estanave was encouraged by Gaumont to investigate the parallax stereogram and started working with the technique late in 1905. On January 24, 1906, Estanave filed for French patent 371.487 for a stereophotography device and stereoscopy using line sheets. It included his \\"changing\\" pictures that applied the principle of Ives' \\"Changeable sign\\" to animated photography, for instance the portrait of a woman with eyes open or closed depending on the viewing angle. On February 3, 1910 he requested an addition to his patent to include animated stereoscopic photography. This system used line sheets with vertical and horizontal lines, and combined four images: two stereoscopic pairs of two different moments. August 1, 1908 Estanave was granted French patent N¬∞ 392871 for an autostereoscopic photographic plate. This plate was exposed and developed to create a positive stereoscopic image, avoiding the trouble of aligning the interlaced photograph with a line screen. In the same year he was awarded a special price at the French Academy of Sciences by Gabriel Lippmann for an x-ray stereogram. In 1911 Estanave discovered another variation: the Joly colour screen (with lines in three colors) could be adapted to create color photographs with the hues shifting when the viewing angle was changed. Fifteen examples of Estanave's stereograms are known to have survived. He seems not have commercialized any of his methods. Others marketed very similar animated portraits, usually with plastic line sheets, with some success in the 1910s and 1920s.  Magic moving picture cards  A Magic Moving Pictures card by G. Felsenthal & Co. Magic moving pictures were composed of images containing black vertical and regularly interlaced stripes, alternating between two or three phases of a depicted motion or between distinctly different pictures. A little transparent sheet with regular vertical black stripes was glued beneath a window in a cardboard envelope holding the picture card. The card was pulled out and pushed back in to produce the illusion of change or motion. The technique was patented in the United States on August 28, 1906, by Alexander S. Spiegel as a nameless \\"display device\\" (application date November 29, 1905). Spiegel patented several improvements, the last in 1911. Initially the pictures were drawings; later photographs were used. The postcards were marketed under Spiegel's patent as Magic moving pictures by G. Felsenthal & Co and as Magic moving picture card by the Franklin Postcard Company, both from Chicago. The latter produced a card in 1912 which enabled the viewer to choose among the portraits of three presidential candidates during that year's U.S. presidential election. Similar cards have been published in Japan around 1920 as Cinematograph by SK and in France around 1940 as Mon cinema chez moi.  Ombro-Cin√©ma  An Ombro-Cin√©ma by Saussine Ed. (1921) Ombro-Cin√©ma toys operated on rotating scrolls of paper with sequences of images printed as interlaced two-frame animations: thin regularly-spaced vertical stripes of one frame of the animation were alternated with stripes of the next frame, alternately hidden by regularly-spaced black vertical stripes on a transparent viewing pane. In some versions the stripes on the viewing pane were disguised as a picket fence. Ombro-Cinema toys had of a wooden or cardboard chassis with a rack and hand-crank for cycling the image scroll across the viewing pane. In some versions a wind-up clockwork mechanism transferred the scroll while operating a music box. The Ombro-Cin√©ma toy was produced by Saussine Ed. in Paris and patented in 1921 and six months later received a gold medal at the 19th Concours L√©pine. Saussine had previously published versions with regular non-animated silhouettes on the scroll, as Ombres Chinoises (Chinese Shadows), patented in 1897. Both toys were named after and inspired by the Ombres Chinoises shadow play that had been very popular in France since 1772. Some of the animated Ombro-Cin√©ma toys are found with the same oriental design and Ombres Chinoises or Theatre Ombres title, but most had a design with Charlie Chaplin's Tramp character and Charles Prince's Rigadin (also interpreted as Fatty Arbuckle) on the proscenium and box.

French circular disc versions inside children's picture books were produced in the 1940s as Album t√©l√©vision and Livre de T√©l√©vision. A French version from around 1950 was named Cin√© Enfantin. Similar wind-up musical toy \\"televisions\\" have been produced until late in the 20th century.  Maurice Bonnet's reli√®phographie  Many inventors tried to expand the amount of images that could be used in line screen technology, which was mostly limited to how wide the lines could be without making the image too dark. French inventor Maurice Bonnet (1907-1994) made several patented improvements with his Reli√®phographie system of the same name. He used a camera with a horizontal row of eleven lenses (French patent N¬∞ 774145, June 5, 1934), followed by one with 33 lenses in 1937 (French patent n¬∞833891, July 2, 1937). The darkness of the images is remedied with a lightbox frame. While the pictures of Estanave could only be seen from the right viewpoint, the multiple images that formed the Reli√®phographs ensured a clear 3D image when viewed from different angles. Bonnet was the only creator of autostereograms with line sheet technology who managed to successfully market his technique, for which he founded his \\"La Reli√®phographie\\" company in 1937. About 13 extant Reli√®phographie pictures by Bonnet are known, including three advertisements, two portraits and eight medical subjects. With their 30x40 cm format these are the largest preserved line sheet autostereograms. Despite the success Bonnet abandoned line sheet technology after he developed a lenticular sheet around 1940.  Autostereoscopic cinema  Russian filmmaker Semyon Ivanov made autostereoscopic movies in the 1940s. In December 1940 the 180-seat theater Moscow Stereokino was built especially for autostereoscopic movies with a rear projection screen (14x19 feet) that used 50 kilometres of fine copper wire as a barrier grid on a metal framework weighing six tons. In 1947 Ivanov made the first autosteroscopic feature film Robinzon Kruzo. Moscow Stereokino showed autostereoscopic movies for 18 years and four more stereokino theatres were built in Russia. Ivanov would later work on lenticular techniques. Sergei Eisenstein wrote in 1947, relating to Ivanov's work: ‚ÄúTo doubt that stereoscopic cinema has its tomorrows, is as na√Øve as doubting whether there will be tomorrows at all.‚Äù Fran√ßois Savoye‚Äôs first Cyclost√©r√©oscope system with a rotating grid was shown to audiences around 1945-46 at the Paris Luna Park. An improved version was shown in the Clichy Palace in Paris in 1953. The size and weight of the required installation and the limited viewing zone to view barrier-grid movies were problems that probably made most barrier-grid cinema systems financially unviable.  Kinegram  Visual artist Gianni A. Sarcone claims to have started developing the kinegram in 1997. He describes his kinegrams as \\"optic kinetic media\\" that \\"artfully combine the visual effects of moir√© patterns with the zoetrope animation technique\\". Sarcone also created \\"Rotating Kinegrams\\" that use a transparent disc with radial lines that has to be spun around its center to animate the picture.  Scanimation  \\"Scanimation\\", incorporating sliding striped acetate sheets into book pages or folding cards to produce barrier- grid animations of six phases or more at each page, was produced by Rufus Butler Seder starting in 2007. The first book Gallop! was followed by Swing!, Kick, Waddle!, Santa and licensed scanimation books of Star Wars, The Wizard of Oz and Peanuts.

The frigate was launched on 17 January 1964, and commissioned on 29 January 1968. Oslo ran aground near Marstein Island on 24 January 1994. One officer was killed in the incident. The next day, on 25 January, she was taken under tow. However as the situation deteriorated, the tow was let go and the frigate sank. Design and description The Oslo class was based on the American s with modifications for northern sea conditions, including more freeboard forward. Oslo was long between perpendiculars and long overall with a beam of and a draught of . The ship had a standard displacement of and was at full load. The frigate was powered by one set of STAL-de Laval PN20 double reduction geared turbines driving one shaft powered by steam provided by two Babcock & Wilcox boilers, rated at . The ship had a maximum speed of and a range of at . Oslo was initially armed with four /50 calibre guns mounted in twin turrets. After a refit in the late 1970s Oslo mounted the two twin 3-inch mounts, six Penguin surface-to-surface missiles, one Mk 29 octuple launcher for Sea Sparrow surface-to-air missiles, carrying 24 missiles in total, and six Mk 32 torpedo tubes in two triple mounts. The ship received her Mk 91 radar director for the Sea Sparrow missiles, and was fitted with DRBU 22, TM 1226 and HSA M 22 radars and SQS-36 sonar. In the late 1980s, Oslo underwent another modernisation. This time the aft twin 3-inch mount was removed to make space for the Teme III rocket-launched depth charges and 40 mm/70 calibre gun and Terne III and TSM 2633 hull and variable depth sonar and replacing the SQS-36. The frigate had a complement of 150 officers and ratings. Service history The frigate was one of five authorised as part of the 1960 naval construction programme. Half the cost of the construction of the ship was borne by the United States. The ship was constructed by the Navy Main Yard, Karljohansvern in Horten, Norway, with the keel laid down in 1963. Named for the capital of Norway, the frigate was launched on 17 January 1964 as the lead ship of her class. Oslo was commissioned into the Royal Norwegian Navy on 25 January 1966. Sinking On 24 January 1994, Oslo ran aground near the Marstein Lighthouse. The frigate had suffered a boiler feed pump failure and drifted in heavy seas before running aground. On 25 January, the tugboat Lars began to tow the frigate. However, as the frigate's situation deteriorated and it was believed that Oslo would not make port, Lars released the tow and the frigate sank.

Early life and education Heather Foster was born in 1966 in Kingston, Jamaica. She has two brothers and one sister. Her parents migrated to Jamaica, Queens, New York City, New York, when she was two and half years old. She was always a very active child, not wanting to make potholders in Girl Scouts, but rather go outside and play stick ball, basketball and sprint against the boys. She has always been into sports: participating in competitive high school and college track & field, and playing junior high school, high school and college basketball.BIOGRAPHY Heather, her sister, and younger brother all started playing in the church basketball league after their father insisted they did. She studied classical piano for 10 years, performing in numerous concerts as a young girl. She filled in at church, and often played for a few gospel group engagements. In junior high school and high school, she joined the chorus. She joined the high school chorus as a sophomore. Her teacher saw a gift in me and decided to sign me up to audition for New York State Voice. They were only accepting 300 students from various New York high schools, and she was selected with a score of 99 out of 100. While in high school, our church choir competed in, and won the 3rd annual McDonald's Gospelfest, which awarded us the opportunity to perform in two concerts at the famed Apollo Theater, where she performed one and a half leads for both scheduled performances. Due to vocal inactivity, she is not as good as she used to be. After high school, Heather attended to City College of New York where she studied physical education, and LaGuardia Community College, where she studied physical therapy. She has been practicing physical therapy since 1991, spending 9 years working for a reputable institution, specializing in sports medicine and rehabilitation. She also has experience in geriatric and pediatric physical therapy. She regularly give seminars in health, fitness, and training for a wide variety of individuals: staff, students, professors, artists, dancers, martial artists, and more. Bodybuilding career Amateur While attending the City College of New York, the college was holding their very first bodybuilding competition. Lyndon Brown, Heather's friend, took it upon himself to start recruiting some female bodybuilders since they didn't have enough women participants. Heather, who originally wanted nothing to do with bodybuilding, got approached by him about participating in the competition and explained what would be expected of me. She rejected his request after learning she had to wear a two-piece bathing suit. She was on the CCNY women's basketball and track teams and had always been muscular, even as a child in junior high school. Eventually Heather agreed to do the show. She was taught the seven mandatory poses and told to put a routine together to music. On competition day she was so nervous that she wore shades on stage so she wouldn't see anyone in the crowd and she demanded they dim the house lights for the same reason. She placed second in the heavyweight class and managed to do so without lighting a single weight prior to the competition. She turned pro at the 2000 NPC Nationals in New York. Professional In 2001, Heather won the heavyweight and overall at her first pro competition, the Women's Pro Extravaganza. In 2006, she won her second pro competition, the Europa Super Show. In 2008 and 2009, she did not compete due to osteitis pubis.Heather Foster After Placing 3rd at the 2010 IFBB New York Pro! In 2010, she placed 6th place at the Ms. Olympia. Heather's routines have gained so much notoriety that an eight time Mr. Olympia Ronnie Coleman contracted her to do his routine for the past two years. Flexonline went so far as to state that his routine at the 2006 Mr. Olympia \\"was arguably the best routine ever seen on an Olympia stage.\\" She also does music arrangements, voice-overs, choreography, training, and contest preparation for regional, national and professional bodybuilders.

It replaced the Listening Devices Act 1984 (NSW).http://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/fullhtml/inforce/act+69+1984+FIRST+0+N The Act makes it an offence to record private conversations apart from in specific and defined circumstances. It makes provision for law enforcement officers to apply for warrants authorising the use of such devices and the circumstances in which judges of the Supreme Court of New South Wales might issue such warrants.  History  In 1997, the Royal Commission into the New South Wales Police Service found that the use of electronic surveillance was the single most important factor in achieving a breakthrough in its investigations. Justice Wood concluded that the law lagged well behind technical developments and patterns of crime and recommended a systematic and comprehensive review of legislation and procedures to assist the pursuit of law enforcement. The Surveillance Devices Bill 2007 (NSW) was introduced into the New South Wales Parliament on 6 November 2007. The bill replaced the Listening Devices Act 1984 (NSW) and expanded the application of the legislation so that it also applies to data surveillance devices, optical surveillance devices and tracking devices.http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/parlment/nswbills.nsf/1d4800a7a88cc2abca256e9800121f01/cbee638a2d4fa787ca25737f001c8a18/$FILE/LA%206407.pdf The aim of the bill was to implement national model legislation developed by the Joint Working Group of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General and the Australasian Police Ministers‚Äô Council on National Investigation Powers. The Second Reading Speech states that for serious crimes like murder, terrorism, drug manufacture and importation it is essential that law enforcement agencies have every possible tool at their disposal to make their investigations and prosecutions as successful as possible. The Act was assented to on 23 November 2007. The date of commencement was 1 August 2008.  Offences  Sections 7-14 create a series of offences carrying penalties ranging from the imposition of a fine to imprisonment of up to five years. The offence creating provisions of the Act provide a comprehensive code designed to protect the privacy of the general population. Exceptions to criminal liability arise where a warrant or Commonwealth law authorises the use of a surveillance device or where a person is protecting their lawful interests. Section 8 makes it an offence carrying a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment to use a listening device ‚Äòto overhear, record, monitor or listen to‚Äô a private conversation to which the person is not a party or to record a private conversation to which there person is a party. In general terms, there are two exceptions. The first exception (under sub-s (2) and (4)) is where the use of the device is authorised by warrant, is part of an operation authorised under the Law Enforcement (Controlled Operations) Act 1997 (NSW) or is incidental to the use of a ‚ÄúTaser‚Äù (a kind of stun gun) issued to a member of the NSW Police Force. The Tasers issued to New South Wales Police are designed to record both the sound and vision of the deployment of the stun gun. The second exception (sub-s (3)) arises where the person is a party to the conversation and the other parties consent or the recording ‚Äúis reasonably necessary for the protection of the lawful interests‚Äù of the party who records the conversation. The breadth and meaning of the ‚Äúlawful interests‚Äù exception has been considered in a number of cases. In DW v R [2014] NSWCCA 28, the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal held that the victim of a sexual assault who recorded a conversation she had with the perpetrator did not commit an offence when her purpose was to convince others of the truth of her allegations. It was held that the recording was made to protect her lawful interests. The same Court reached a similar conclusion in Sepulveda v R [2006] NSWCCA 379, a decision under the earlier Listening Devices Act. In R v Le [2004] NSWCCA 82, the Court was divided on whether a friend of a man charged with the murder of politician John Newman had a lawful interest in recording a conversation with Albert Ranse who had previously claimed responsibility for the murder. Giles JA found that protection of lawful interests do not encompass credibility generally or in the event of giving evidence. On the contrary, Hulme and Adams JJ found that the avoidance of \\"being labeled a liar\\" (within a criminal investigation) is an important lawful interest and the recording of the conversation was the only practicable mode of preventing or refuting such an allegation. Similar offences are created to prohibit the use of the other devices dealt with under the Act. Section 9 makes it an offence to install or use a tracking device to determine the location of a person or object. Exceptions to criminal liability are (i) authorisation by warrant, (ii) authorisation under Australian commonwealth law or (iii) ‚Äúlawful purpose‚Äù. The scope of the last defence has not been considered. Section 10 makes it an offence to use a ‚Äúdata surveillance device‚Äù to record or monitor the input or output of information from a computer if the installation or maintenance involves entry onto premises without consent or interference with the computer or the network on which the computer operates. The breadth of this provision has not been considered but it is difficult to imagine the use of such a device that does not involve some interference with the computer or the computer network. Section 11 creates an offence of communicating the contents of a private conversation that has come to the person‚Äôs knowledge as a result of the prohibited use of a surveillance device. The offence does not encompass communication to the parties to the conversation or for the purpose of prosecuting an offence. The other exception is whether the communication is ‚Äúreasonably necessary in connection with an imminent threat‚Äù of serious drug offences, offences of violence and serious damage to property. Section 12 prohibits the possession of a record of a private conversation. Section 13 makes it an offence to manufacture, supply or possess a surveillance device with the intention that it be used contrary to the Act. Section 14 creates an offence of communicating or publishing information derived or obtained by the unlawful use of a data tracking device. Similar exceptions to those under s 11.  Warrants  Part 3 of the Act provides for the issue of surveillance device and retrieval warrants. Section 16 provides that only an ‚Äúeligible judge‚Äù may issue a warrant although an eligible magistrate may issue a retrieval warrant or a warrant that authorises the use of a tracking device only. Section 51 provides that the Attorney General must be notified that an application for a warrant is to be made.  Eligible Judges  Section 5 defines an eligible judge as a Judge of the Supreme Court of New South Wales. For a Supreme Court judge to be eligible to issue a warrant he or she must sign a written consent and be the subject of a declaration by the Attorney- General of New South Wales. Once made a declaration cannot be revoked by the Attorney General unless the Judge withdraws their consent or the Chief Justice notifies the Attorney General that the Judge should no longer be an authorised judge.  Applications for surveillance device warrants  Applications for warrants can be made by state or federal police as well as a number of agencies including the New South Wales Crime Commission and the Independent Commission Against Corruption (New South Wales) A law enforcement officer may apply to an eligible judge for a surveillance device warrant to be issued if they believe on reasonable grounds that: :(a) an offence has been, is being or is likely to be committed :(b) there is an investigation into the offence :(c) the use of a surveillance is necessary to obtain evidence of the offence or the identity of the location of the offender. Section 17 provides the formalities of the application. The application must state that name of the applicant, the nature, kind and duration or the warrant sought and must be supported by an affidavit (that is, a statement made under part 5 of the Oaths Act 1900 (NSW). In cases of urgency the application can be made before the affidavit is prepared. In such a case the applicant must provide the necessary information within the next 72 hours. Section 17(6) provides that an application for a warrant is not to be heard in open court. This is to ensure that the subject of the warrant is not put on notice of the covert investigation. The eligible judge may issue the warrant if satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for the belief stated by the law enforcement officer: s 19(1). The use of the term ‚Äúmay‚Äù means that the Judge has discretion as to whether the warrant should be issued. Section 19(2) provides a number of factors to be taken into account in determining whether to issue the warrant. These include: # The nature and seriousness of the alleged offence. # The extent to which the privacy of any person may be affected. # Whether there is any other way to obtain the evidence. # The importance of the information to the investigation and its evidentiary value. # Whether there has been any previous warrant. Section 20 provides the formal requirements of a warrant. The warrant must specify the matters referred to in section 20(1). This includes the fact that the Judge is satisfied of the relevant criteria justifying the issue of the warrant. It must also specify the offence, the kind of surveillance device it authorises and the premises, vehicle or person to which the warrant attaches. The warrant must also state the period during which the warrant will remain in force. The maximum period is 90 days. The warrant must specify the name of the applicant and the officer primarily responsible for its execution. The warrant can also state conditions on the use of the surveillance device. The warrant must be signed by the Judge and include his or her name. In the case of a warrant issued under a remote application, the Judge must inform the applicant of the terms of the warrant and the date and time it was issued. The Judge must keep a register and enter the details into the register. The Judge must provide the applicant with a copy of the warrant as soon as possible after it is issued remotely. While the application must be made to a judge, the act of granting the warrant is considered to be an administrative, not judicial, function: Ousley v R [1997] HCA 49. This means that the ability to challenge the warrant is limited. If the warrant is ‚Äúvalid on its face‚Äù, the opportunity for collateral challenge to the admissibility of the evidence derived from its use is restricted. There is no duty to give reasons and the application is determined in private (that is, in the Judge‚Äôs chambers). Controversy surrounding the issue of surveillance device warrants led to Chief Justice Tom Bathurst making a statement that judges were now required to give short written reasons for the issue of the warrant.  What a surveillance device warrant authorises  Section 21 sets out the detail of the things that a surveillance device may authorise: :(a) The use of a surveillance device on or in specified premises or a vehicle; :(b) The use of a surveillance device in or on a specified object or class of object; :(c) The use of a surveillance device in respect of the conversations, activities or geographical location of a specified person or a person whose identity is unknown; :(d) The use of a surveillance device on or about the body of a specified person. The warrant also authorises the installation, use and maintenance of the surveillance device and the entry, by force if necessary, onto or into the premises or vehicle subject of the warrant. It may also authorise entry (by force) onto adjoining premises or premises through which access to the subject premises or vehicle might be obtained.  Admissibility of evidence obtained by surveillance device In New South Wales the admissibility of evidence is determined by the application of the common law and the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). If evidence is obtained unlawfully, it is inadmissible unless the Court is satisfied that the ‚Äúdesirability of admitting the evidence outweighs the undesirability of admitting evidence obtained in the way in which the evidence was obtained‚Äù. This means that if evidence is obtained by the use of a surveillance device contrary to the Surveillance Devices Act, the evidence cannot be used in evidence unless the party seeking to tender the evidence convinces the Judge that it should be allowed. There is a list of factors in sub-section (3) to be taken into account: :(a) The probative value of the evidence, and :(b) The importance of the evidence in the proceeding, and :(c) The nature of the relevant offence, cause of action or defence and the nature of the subject- matter of the proceeding, and :(d) The gravity of the impropriety or contravention, and :(e) Whether the impropriety or contravention was deliberate or reckless, and :(f) Whether the impropriety or contravention was contrary to or inconsistent with a right of a person recognised by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and :(g) Whether any other proceeding (whether or not in a court) has been or is likely to be taken in relation to the impropriety or contravention, and :(h) The difficulty (if any) of obtaining the evidence without impropriety or contravention of an Australian law. In R v Simmons (No 2) [2015] NSWCCA 143 members of the NSW police were undertaking a complex undercover sting operation. They had obtained surveillance device warrants on a number of occasions to record conversations they had with a man suspected of murder. However, two of the warrants had expired by a number days and police had failed to apply to have the warrants renewed. The Prosecutor submitted that it was merely an oversight and the unlawfulness or contravention of the Act was not serious. Justice Hamill disagreed saying at [138]: :‚ÄúContrary to the submission of the Crown, I find that the impropriety is quite grave: s 138(3)(d). The rights to silence and to privacy are important parts of a functioning democracy and free and civilised society. Where safeguards such as the Surveillance Devices Act are enacted, law enforcement officers must be fastidious in ensuring that they are complied with.‚Äù As it turned out the conversations were recorded by another (lawful) surveillance device and so the question of admissibility did not arise. The prosecutor did not lead the evidence that had been obtained without a warrant. However, where a warrant is invalid for technical reasons but the police genuinely believed that they were acting lawfully, the discretion will generally be exercised in favour of admitting the evidence: see, for example, R v WJ Eade [2000] NSWCCA 369; R v Sibraa [2012] NSWCCA 19. This is because the impropriety was not reckless or deliberate. On the other hand, if a warrant is obtained by deceiving the Judge or Magistrate, the trial Judge has the power to exclude the evidence even though the warrant is valid on its face. In Flanagan v Australian Federal Police [1996] FCA 16; 134 ALR 495 the Federal Court of Australia held (at 545): :‚ÄúIn short, we are of the opinion that, in the criminal trial, it is open to the applicants to urge that the product, and the fruits of the product, be excluded. Whether the allegations of bad faith and impropriety will in fact be made out, and whether, if so, the power, duty or discretion to exclude the product and its fruits should be exercised, the questions entirely within the jurisdiction of the County Court.‚Äù It has been held that the issue of a warrant is an administrative, not a judicial, act. Accordingly, it has been held that if the warrant is ‚Äúvalid on its face‚Äù, the opportunity for collateral attack on the warrant is limited: See for example, Love v Attorney General [1990] HCA 4. Accordingly, In Ousley v R [1997] HCA 49, it was held by Gaudron J (at 85) that the collateral review of the warrant is ‚Äúlimited to the validity of the warrant on its face‚Äù. Justice Toohey held (at 80): :‚ÄúIt is not open to the judge to adjudicate on the sufficiency of a warrant or whether the issuing authority was in fact satisfied as to any statutory requirements.‚Äù 49 However, it is not the case that a warrant that is valid on its face can never be subject to collateral attack. For example, when the NSW Crime Commissioner purported to authorise by warrant the sale of large quantities of cocaine in the hope to entrap drug dealers, the High Court of Australia held that the warrants were invalid. That was because it was not open to the Commissioner to conclude that the activity was not likely to seriously endanger the health or safety of any person. This was a ‚Äújurisdictional fact‚Äù (a term used loosely in the appeal) upon which the validity of the commissioner‚Äôs power to issue the warrant turned. See Gedeon v NSW Crime Commission [2008] HCA 43 at [47]-[57]. In summary: :(i) Where evidence is obtained by use of the surveillance device which is not authorised under the Act (by warrant or as an exception to the prohibition), it is unlawfully obtained evidence. It cannot be used unless Judge is convinced that it should be allowed. :(ii) If there is a warrant, the warrant can be challenged but only in limited circumstances. The decision to issue the warrant cannot be challenged if the warrant is valid on its face. :(iii) If the warrant was obtained by deceiving the issuing Judge, the evidence is likely to be inadmissible. :(iv) If the police believe the warrant authorises the use of the device, but it does not, the trial Judge must balance competing considerations including the right to privacy and whether the breach was reckless or merely an oversight.  Requirement to Inform Subject of Surveillance  Under section 52, If an eligible judge is satisfied that, having regard to the evidence obtained by the use of the surveillance device and to any other relevant matter, the use of the surveillance device was not justified and was an unnecessary interference with the privacy of the person concerned, the Judge may direct the person to whom the warrant was issued to supply to the subject of the warrant, information regarding the warrant and the use of the device. Before giving a direction under this sections the Judge must give the person to whom the warrant was issued an opportunity to be heard on the matter.  Reporting and Record Keeping  A person to whom a surveillance device warrant is issued must, within the time specified in the warrant, send a written report to the eligible judge or magistrate who issued the warrant and also to the Attorney General. The report must state: :(a) whether or not a surveillance device was used pursuant to the warrant; :(b) (if used) the type of surveillance device; :(c) the name (if known) of any person whose private conversation was recorded or listened to, or whose activity was recorded by the device; :(d) the period during which the device was used; :(e) the particulars of any premises or vehicle on or in which the device was installed or any place at which the device was used; :(f) the particulars of any previous use of surveillance device in connection with the offence in respect of which the warrant was issued.  Inspections  Section 48 of the Act states that the Ombudsman must, from time to time, inspect the records of each law enforcement agency (other than the Australian Crime Commission) to determine the extent of compliance with the Surveillance Devices Act 2007 (NSW) by the agency and law enforcement officers of the agency. The Ombudsman must make a written report to the Minister at 6-monthly intervals on the results of an inspection under section 48. Within 15 days, this report must be placed before both Houses of Parliament.  Review of the Act  Section 63(2) of the Act states that a statutory review \\"is to be undertaken as soon as possible after the period of 5 years from the date of assent to this Act.\\" Section 63(3) states \\"A report on the outcome of the review is to be tabled in each House of Parliament within 12 months after the end of the period of 5 years.\\" The date of assent was 23 November 2007, 5 years from that date was 23 November 2012. As at 17 June 2015 a report had not been tabled. On 31 May 2015, New South Wales Attorney-General said that the Surveillance Devices Act was under review and stated; :\\"The Department of Justice continues to consult with stakeholders on whether the Act's policy objectives remain valid and whether the terms of the Act remain appropriate for securing those objectives.....The review will consider the relevant case law.\\"  Criticisms   Number of Warrants Issued  It was reported by The Australian in 2013 that Police in NSW have obtained three times more surveillance device warrants than the combined Queensland Police Service, South Australia Police, Western Australia Police and Tasmania Police over 3 years. Statistics published by the NSW Ombudsman reveal that NSW officers obtained 1600 surveillance device warrants in the two years to December 2012. That compares with 204 for Western Australia, 143 for Queensland, 73 for South Australia and at least 66 for Tasmania in the three years to June, according to annual reports held by those states. Figures were not available for Victoria.http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/state-politics/nsw- the-top-state-for-police-wiretaps/story-e6frgczx-1226792187662  No Relevant Information  The NSW Council for Civil Liberties have asked for amendments to the Act, with more stringent checking of police requests to use devices after it was found that only 43% of warrants resulted in relevant information being obtained.  Reporting Concerns  On April 14, 2014, it was reported that the NSW Council for Civil Liberties and the NSW opposition were concerned about the lack of oversight into reporting after Ombudsman Bruce Barbour found police were breaching the Surveillance Devices Act 2007 (NSW) by recording outside warrant terms and failing to report back to judges and the Attorney General on surveillance device use.  \\"Rubber Stamping\\"  The Age reported that in 2014, NSW Courts refused less than 2 per cent of police applications for surveillance device warrants. Only 6 of 363 applications were rejected in the first half of 2014 - an increase from no rejections out of 878 application in the 12 months prior. Shadow NSW Attorney-General Paul Lynch states; :\\"The very low rate of refusals suggests either that applications for surveillance device warrants by NSW police are consistently of an almost perfect standard, or that the process of approval lacks rigour\\" A 2015 report from the Ombudsman found that police were \\"systematically failing to destroy recordings that weren't needed for criminal investigations, in breach of the Act. Instead they were being archived.\\"  Australian Uniform Surveillance Laws  In a report into Serious Invasions of Privacy in the Digital Era in March 2014, the Australian Law Reform Commission (‚ÄòALRC‚Äô) found that there were significant inconsistencies between states and territories in the laws with respect to the types of devices regulated and with respect to the offences, defences and exceptions. It was argued that this inconsistency results in uncertainty and complexity, reducing privacy protection for individuals and increasing compliance burdens for organisations. The ALRC recommended that surveillance device laws should be uniform throughout Australia, to be achieved through Commonwealth legislation.https://www.alrc.gov.au/sites/default/files/pdfs/publications/final_report_123_whole_report.pdf  Terrorism Related Offences  When the Act was introduced in parliament, former Attorney General and Minister for Justice, John Hatzistergos emphasised that a major function of the Act was to allow law enforcement agencies ‚Äúevery possible tool at their disposal‚Äù to ‚Äúconfront the very real threat of terrorism occurring on Australian soil.‚Äùhttp://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/parlment/nswbills.nsf/1d4800a7a88cc2abca256e9800121f01/cbee638a2d4fa787ca25737f001c8a18/$FILE/LC6407.pdf The NSW Council for Civil Liberties noted that although considerable time was dedicated by the New South Wales Government in linking the use of surveillance device warrants to terrorism-related offences. The NSW Ombudsman Reports outline the crimes for which a warrant has been sought and ‚ÄòTerrorism offences‚Äô are listed in the ‚ÄòOther‚Äô category along with offences including ‚Äòcorrupt conduct‚Äô, ‚Äòmanslaughter‚Äô and ‚Äògambling offences‚Äô. In 2012 the ‚ÄòOther‚Äô category accounted for only 3% of the warrants issued during the reporting period.https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/nswccl/pages/601/attachments/original/1418077111/2013_submission_surveillance_devices_act.pdf?1418077111  Warrant Period  Warrants are valid for 90 days from issuance. In the Second Reading Speech the Hon. Michael Gallacher (member for the Opposition) provided that the 90-day period is too long. Under the old Act, the period a warrant was valid for was 21 days. If it was needed for a longer period of time an application for an extension could be made. He spoke of the ease at which police officers were able to extend their warrants if necessary under the old act and stated that the 21-day provision put forward by the Opposition will enable ‚Äúa degree of checks and balances and ensure the maintenance of probity‚Äù. Member for the Greens Ms Rhiannon Lee describes the extension of the warrant period as ‚Äúan extraordinary shift. The Government was offered no convincing case for such a lengthy extension.‚Äù Hatzistergos replied that ‚Äúa bunch of bleeding hearts, the Council for Civil Liberties actually supported it [move to a 90-day warrant period]‚Äù. In a submission to the Department of Attorney-General and Justice regarding the statutory review of the Surveillance Devices Act 2007 (NSW) dated 27 September 2013, the NSW Council for Civil Liberties state that they never supported this extension, and maintain the position that the 90-day period should be reduced to 21 days.  Ethics of Surveillance  The ethics of surveillance in general and the Surveillance Devices Act 2007 (NSW) in particular have been criticised by members of both the Labor party and the Greens. During the Second Reading Speech, member for the Greens, Ms Rhiannon Lee said; :‚ÄúIn recent years since the 9/11 tragedy there has been no attempt to get the balance right [on surveillance]. Consequently the balance has swung in favour of the police. The authorities have cracked down and as a result people have lost their basic rights. We also should not be blinded by technological advances in surveillance as though they are magic silver bullet that will solve crime in New South Wales, catch all the terrorists and make everybody feel safe. It is dangerous to cultivate such a notion because technological surveillance will not be the solution that it is often presented to be. If surveillance powers are abused, people are left open to victimisation and discrimination. The Council of Civil Liberties submission on the draft surveillance bill in 2006 stated: ::‚ÄòCovert intrusions leave a person vulnerable to mistaken data- matching. The knowledge that words and actions may be being monitored restricts autonomy and hampers personal growth and the development and enjoyment of relationships. In the hands of the unscrupulous, covert surveillance leaves victims open to blackmail.‚Äô‚Äù  Controversies   Police Bugging Scandal ‚Äì ‚ÄòOperation Prospect‚Äô  In 2003, Strike Force Emblems was established in response to allegations that warrants were improperly obtained during Operation Mascot, an investigation into police corruption in the late 1990s. The warrants authorised a large number of people, mostly police officers, to have their private conversations ‚Äòbugged‚Äô. This included the controversial ‚ÄòBell warrant‚Äô containing 114 names. The investigators involved in Strike Force Emblems believed that false or misleading information had been used to obtain the warrants but their investigations were obstructed by a lack of co-operation on behalf of the New South Wales Crime Commission. Nearly a decade later in October 2012, the New South Wales Government announced that the Ombudsman would investigate allegations concerning the conduct of officers in the NSW Police Force, the Crime Commission and the Police Integrity Commission in relation to the matters investigated in Strike Force Emblems which occurred between 1998 and 2002. The Select Committee on the Conduct and Progress of the Ombudsman‚Äôs Inquiry ‚ÄúOperation Prospect‚Äù states that in 2012 the legislative council was assured by the government that the Ombudsman would report in 6 months. The final hearings were not completed until 31 March 2015. The Acting NSW Ombudsman, John McMillan's, report to Parliament was tabled on 20 December 2016.

Triebel worked through the 1990s in a collaboration between Institut Gustave Roussy and Merck Serono to establish LAG-3's mechanism of action in T cells and dendritic cells. In 2001 he founded Immutep SA, a biotech company, to develop the therapeutic potential of LAG3. In 2014 this company was acquired by Prima BioMed, where Triebel remains Chief Scientific and Medical Officer. Early life and education He completed his Doctor of Medicine degree at Poitiers University in 1981 and then a four-year clinical hematology fellowship in Paris hospitals. In 1983, Fr√©d√©ric Triebel received the Gold Medal of the Paris Medicine University. In parallel, Triebel gained a PhD in Immunology at the University of Paris VI in 1985. His PhD thesis was in the field of immunogenetics, focused on the mechanisms that activate human antigen-specific T-cells. Career From 1986 until the late 1990s, Triebel headed the cellular immunology group in the Department of Clinical Biology of the Institut Gustave Roussy. In 1990 he gained a Chair in Molecular Immunogenetics and Biotherapy at the University of Paris XI. Between 1991 and 1996 was director of an INSERM unit (U333). He founded Immutep SA in 2001 in order to develop the clinical potential of LAG3 and stayed with this company through to its acquisition by Prima BioMed in 2014. Triebel remains Chief Scientific and Medical Officer of Immutep. From 1993 to 1998, Fr√©d√©ric Triebel was appointed as member of the Institut Universitaire de France.http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000530291 Work on LAG3 prior to 2001 Triebel reported the first cloning of the LAG3 gene in 1990, and two years later his team were able to show that the LAG-3 protein was a ligand for MHC Class II molecules like CD4. In 1997 the Triebel lab identified the LAG-3 amino-acid residues involved in LAG-3/MHC class II interaction. In 1998 Triebel et al. performed the first characterization of the human CD4/LAG-3 gene locus, in the process identifying the LAG-3 promoter regulatory elements. Also in 1998 the Triebel team were the first to characterizing the negative regulatory role of LAG-3 on CD3/TCR signaling. His team was the first to show that, as a soluble molecule, LAG-3 activates antigen-presenting cells through MHC class II signalling, resulting in antigen-specific T-cell responses. Soluble LAG3, in a dimeric recombinant form called LAG-3Ig is now Immutep's lead compound. Immutep Fr√©d√©ric Triebel founded Immutep in 2001 with John Hawken, a bioentrepreneur, to acquire the intellectual property which Triebel had created with INSERM and the Institut Gustave Roussy related to LAG3 and then move LAG3-based products into the clinic. Serono granted an exclusive worldwide license. The company raised ‚Ç¨2.5m in venture capital in late 2003 and another ‚Ç¨2.5m in January 2005. Between 2001 and 2014 Immutep scientists did further basic and applied research on LAG3 and also completed a number of clinical studies, most notable in metastatic renal cell carcinoma in 2009 and metastatic breast cancer in 2010.

What allows a person to go beyond the \\"animal\\" nature is the most common religion that imposes specific normative system and is a way to regulate behaviour.

Contrary to its title, the film is not an adaptation of Alice in Wonderland but that of Jack and the Beanstalk. Plot Oswald lives in a house with his grandmother. Although they have a low income, they don't feel so down. One day the landlord pays them a visit. The landlord tells them they have been unable to pay rent to the house in a timely manner, and therefore they need to move out in a few hours. While the grandmother is saddened by this, Oswald offers her hope as he intends to sell their cow. Oswald heads to the outdoors, where he sells the cow to a wizard. In exchange, the wizard offers a sack of beans. Nevertheless, Oswald is pleased of what he got as he happily rushes back towards the house. But on the way, he stumbles, and the beans in the bag drop into a hole in the ground. In no time the beans grow into a huge stalk that stretches toward the sky. One of the stalk's stems catches Oswald, and carries him upward. When the stalk reaches its peak, Oswald is surprised to see a large castle in the clouds. Intrigued by the castle's presence, Oswald enters a window to explore the building. Upon going inside, Oswald finds an anthropomorphic doll tied onto a clock's pendulum. Oswald comes to and frees her. As gratitude, the doll tells him there is a hen that lays golden eggs. Oswald and the doll reach a room where the special hen is located. When the doll asks for an egg, the hen is considerate to lay one. But when Oswald himself asks, the hen, for some reason, refuses. The hen goes to make some noise which wakes up a giant bull. And when the bull pursues them, Oswald and the doll have no choice but to leave. After exiting the castle, they climb down the stalk. The giant bull follows them in the same way. Back on the ground, Oswald's grandmother is outdoors in another meeting with the landlord who comes to signal her family's move. When the grandmother spots Oswald coming down the stalk, the ruthless landlord goes on the cut down the tall plant with an ax. But in doing so, the landlord ends up smashed under the giant bull who is unconscious. Oswald and the doll make it safely to the ground, and celebrate.

He was involved in the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford and later was the librarian-curator of the Museum for the Somerset Archaeological and Natural History Society. Gray was born in 1872 in Lichfield. In 1888 he started working for the archaeologist Augustus Pitt Rivers and trained in archaeological techniques and later took over as his secretary. In 1899 he became assistant to Henry Balfour at the Pitt Rivers Museum before leaving to become curator at the museum in Taunton, which later became the Museum of Somerset, where he stayed until 1949 and wrote frequent papers for their journal. During this time he was involved in the dismissal of Frederick Bligh Bond as archaeologist at Glastonbury Abbey when he claimed that much of his work was helped by the \\"spirits of Glastonbury monks\\". After leaving Pitt- Rivers he led the excavations at Arbor Low in 1901 and 1902, and then worked on the rings on Bodmin Moor. In 1904 he was involved with Arthur Bulleid in the excavation of Glastonbury Lake Village and later at Meare Lake Village. One of Gray's contributions to archaeology was the scale of the excavations undertaken and the detailed records kept following the teaching of his mentor Pitt-Rivers. He also developed techniques of making three dimensional models of the sites. From 1908 to 1913 he was responsible for excavations at Maumbury Rings, and from 1908 to 1923 at Avebury. His discovery of over forty antler picks at or near the bottom of the henge ditch at Avebury proved that it had been dug out of solid chalk to a depth of using red deer antlers as picks. In 1922 he excavated Cadbury Camp, and from 1926 to 1929 he was at Windmill Hill, Avebury with Alexander Keiller. In 1943 he bought the Treasurer's House in Martock to preserve it. His wife bequeathed it to the National Trust in 1970. Gray was president of the Somerset Archaeological and Natural History Society from 1951 to 1952 and died in 1963.

Description Jones Island is an island located at the northern end of Anxious Bay at the mouth of Baird Bay about south of the town of Baird Bay and about south-southeast of the town of Streaky Bay on the west coast of Eyre Peninsula in South Australia.RAN, 1979 The island is about long with a maximum width of .Robinson et al, 1996, page 477 The island is reported as having a perimeter consisting of ‚Äúsharp cliffs‚Äù to its south eastern coast which is exposed to the ocean and a ‚Äúledge‚Äù on its sheltered north western side. Access to the island is reported as being weather dependent due to the absence of a suitable landing point (i.e. beach or inlet) on its sheltered side and the presence of adverse sea conditions caused by waves diffracted around its shoreline.Robinson et al, 1996, page 180 Formation, geology and oceanography Jones Island was formed about 6000 years ago following the rise of sea levels at the start of the Holocene.Robinson et al, 1996, Page 12 Jones Island consists of a calcarenite layer over a granite base. It is reported as being the remnant of a ‚Äúcalcarenite wall that once held back the ocean from the low-lying valley to the north‚Äù.DEH, 2006, page 4 Jones Island is the permanently exposed part of a submerged reef system extending from the southern headland of Baird Bay across the south side of the mouth of the bay in a south-southwest direction for a distance of about .DMH, 1985, chart 39 Flora and fauna Flora A survey carried out during 1983 on Jones Island found that its vegetation consisted of the following five groupings: coast daisy-bush, nitre-bush, Austral stork's bill, introduced pasture mainly on the north western side of the island and round-leaved pigface.Robinson et al, 1996, page 178 Fauna Australian sea lion mother and cub Vertebrate animals are represented by mammals, birds and reptiles. As of 1996, mammals are represented exclusively by the Australian sea lion which uses the island both as a haul out and as a breeding colony. As of 2006, the following bird species have been observed on the island: white-faced heron, sooty oystercatcher, welcome swallow, silver gull, little grassbird, rock parrot, osprey, Australian pelican, black cormorant, black-faced cormorant, willie wagtail, crested tern, common starling, and masked plover.DEH, 2006, pages 65, 68, 69, 70 and 71 While most of the bird species are reported as using the island as a roost, the Australian pelican also uses it as a breeding colony.DEH, 2006, page 69 As of 2006, only one species of reptile, the bull skink, has been observed.Robinson et al, 1996, page 180 History European discovery and use Jones Island is one of the islands off the west coast of Eyre Peninsula where native vegetation was cleared for ‚Äúgrazing by early pastoralists‚Äù.DEH, 2006, page 19 The island was named in 1908 after J.W. Jones who was a senior employee of the South Australian Government and whose roles are reported as including Secretary to the Premier and Secretary to the Commissioner of Public Works.DEH, 2006, page 4 Protected areas status Jones Island first received protected area status along with the unnamed island in Baird Bay as a fauna conservation reserve declared under the Crown Lands Act 1929-1966 on 16 March 1967.. Since 1972, it has been part of the Baird Bay Islands Conservation Park. Since 2012, the waters adjoining the shoreline of Jones Island are in a habitat protection zone within the West Coast Bays Marine Park. The island is also located at the south eastern boundary of an area which covers the full extent of Baird Bay and which has been listed since at least 1996 as a \\"wetland of national importance\\" in the Directory of Important Wetlands in Australia.Robinson et al, 1996, page 144DEH, 2006, page 5DEWNR, 2012, page 26Eyles et al, 2001, pages 73 & 77DOE, 2010 See also *List of islands of Australia Citations and references Citations References  Islands of South Australia Uninhabited islands of Australia Great Australian Bight ","title":"Jones Island (South Australia)"},{"id":"46534285","text":"East Portal is an unincorporated community in Mineral County, in the U.S. state of Montana.

Her case, among others, sparked international attention towards Indonesia's capital punishment and drug prohibition laws. Background Veloso was born in Cabanatuan, Nueva Ecija. She is the youngest of five siblings. She and her husband married when she was around 17 years old but they later separated. They have two sons. Prior to her arrest, in 2009, Veloso worked in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates for about six months. Her father said that she left her job because her employer attempted to rape her. Conviction Veloso was arrested in Indonesia in April 2010 for smuggling of heroin in a suitcase. Throughout her trial, she maintained her innocence, claiming that she was duped into carrying the suitcase by her godsister who convinced her to go to Indonesia after losing a job in Malaysia. Veloso was sentenced to death in October 2010 but was spared due to a moratorium on capital punishment enacted by Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono. She was again scheduled to be executed in January 2015 after the election of Joko Widodo as President of Indonesia. She was scheduled to be executed in Nusa Kambangan together with the Bali Nine duo from Australia, Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran; Brazilian Rodrigo Gularte; an Indonesian and four Nigerians at 1:00 AM WIB (2:00 AM PHT) on 29 April 2015. At midnight on 29 April 2015, Veloso was granted a stay of execution so she could act as a witness during the trial of her alleged human trafficker. News of the reprieve came so close to the scheduled time of her execution that several news outlets reported erroneously that it had occurred. The front page headline on one newspaper read \\"Death Came Before Dawn\\". She was reprieved after reports that her trafficker had surrendered to the police, which had prompted Philippines President Benigno Aquino III to make a final appeal for clemency on the basis that her testimony could be invaluable in the prosecuting her alleged recruiter. Veloso's alleged trafficker Maria Kristina Sergio, along with Sergio's live-in partner Julius Lacanilao and an African national tentatively identified as \\"Ike\\", will face charges of human trafficking, illegal recruiting and estafa (fraud). Her mother believes Veloso was spared by a 'miracle'; the other eight prisoners scheduled for execution alongside her were executed by firing squad early on the morning of 29 April. According to The Jakarta Post, on 12 September 2016, Indonesia President Joko Widodo reported that Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte had authorized Veloso's execution. However, on the same day, a Manila Bulletin article said that Manny Pi√±ol, the Philippines Agriculture Secretary, said that Duterte actually asked for clemency for Veloso. Veloso was still awaiting execution in her Indonesian prison cell on 19 June 2017. In August 2016, motions were heard to depose her testimony regarding the human trafficking charges against Maria Kristina Sergio and Julius Lacanilao.The motion was granted, but no time was set for when the deposition was to occur. Judge Reyes denied a defense motion in November to block the deposition, stating she found no compelling reason to reverse her decision. On 13 February 2017, the Hon. Anarica J. Castillo-Reyes affirmed the motion to take Veloso's deposition. The resolution scheduled the deposition to be done on 27 April 2017. The Court of Appeals ordered a temporary restraining order on 24 March, preventing the prosecutor from interviewing Veloso. Associate Justice Ramon M. Bato Jr., on behalf of the Court of Appeals, issued a proclamation on 22 May finding in favor of the defense motion that disallowed taking Veloso's deposition, because it was claiming that it violated the plaintiffs' right to face their accuser. On 16 June 2017, the Veloso family filed a motion for reconsideration through the National Union of Peoples' Lawyers, asking the Court of Appeals to rescind the order preventing the prosecutor from deposing Veloso at the Yogyakarta prison. The family's argument for the motion was that Veloso may run out of time and be executed before she could testify. The motion stated, \\"No damage can be irreparable as what Mary Jane stands to suffer ‚Äî to be muzzled before she is silenced forever, to die without ever being heard.‚Äù Impact She has been compared to Flor Contemplacion and Sarah Balabagan due to their backgrounds as expatriate maids with death sentences. Veloso's case gained support in Indonesia and internationally after her appeals for clemency were rejected. Notable Indonesians who supported her included chef Rahung Nasution, French- Indonesian singer Anggun, Archbishop Ignatius Suharyo Hardjoatmodjo, and maid Erwiana Sulistyaningsih. Supporters in Veloso's home country of the Philippines included boxer Manny Pacquiao, who even visited her at her Yogyakarta prison, migrant and human rights organizations. Internationally, United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, Nobel Peace Prize winner and former East Timor President Jos√© Ramos-Horta, British tycoon Richard Branson, English musician Tony Iommi and American author Eve Ensler spoke publicly in support of Veloso. The petition for her release at Change.org was the fastest- growing petition from the Philippines ever and gained over 250,000 signatories from over 125 countries. On 27 April 2015, during the ASEAN Summit in Kuala Lumpur, representatives from the ASEAN Youth Forum met with Widodo in an attempt to save Veloso's life.

Samples of potable water in Hong Kong were found to contain excessive levels of heavy metals including lead, nickel and cadmium in 2015. Such discoveries of contamination caused widespread crisis within the city. The scandal began in June 2015 when the Democratic Party announced that testing of drinking water at Kai Ching Estate in Kowloon revealed lead contamination. The Hong Kong Housing Authority subsequently confirmed that the levels of lead exceeded the standard established by the World Health Organization. Since the initial discovery at Kai Tak, lead contamination of drinking water has been found at numerous other housing estates, schools, and public buildings across Hong Kong.  Heavy metal content in domestically used water  Portable water that is used in Hong Kong indicated high levels of heavy metal when it was tested. The heavy metals include lead and nickel. The discovery was made in 2015 when the Democratic Party undertook the responsibility of testing the water that was used at Kai Ching Estate. Hong Kong Housing Authority also discovered the presence of heavy metal in the water that was used was higher in comparison to the World Health Organization standards. Since lead water pipes have been used in the past there are certain acceptable limits of lead occurrence in drinking water where Hong Kong standard limit is at 10 micrograms of lead per litre. Helena Wong who is a member of the Democratic Party led to the exposure of the presence of high levels beyond the set standard of lead occurrence in domestic used water in an estate in Kowloon City. The source that resulted to high level of lead in the water was the illegal welding at the joints of the water pipes. After the discovery was made the government tried to shift the blame to the contractor but the contractor rejected the blame. The contractor claimed that his organisation was responsible for the installation of outside pipes thus didn't undertake the mandate to install the pipes inside the building. Lead standards Lead is a toxicant that can cause serious and irreversible health damage. Children are especially vulnerable to its effects. Due to the historic usage of lead water pipes, many jurisdictions have legal limits on safety levels of lead content in drinking water. Hong Kong standards limit the acceptable lead content of drinking water to 10 micrograms of lead per litre, the same standard as Europe, Australia, Taiwan, Japan and Singapore. For comparison, the United States allows 15 micrograms while Mainland China allows 10 micrograms per litre. Discovery and cause On 5 July 2015 Democratic Party legislator Helena Wong exposed the lead contamination in tap water at Kai Ching Estate, a newly constructed public housing estate in Kowloon City. Samples had been sent for testing at one of the six laboratories authorised by the government.http://www.ejinsight.com/20151111-carrie-lam-query-about-test- lab-worried-legislator/ According to the Water Supplies Department, the public monopoly supplier of potable water, the contamination was caused by illegal soldering at the joints of water pipes. Government officials attempted to pass the blame onto a building contractor. The contractor in turn rejected the accusation, saying that he had installed outside piping and had no role in installing pipes inside the building to each apartment. He asserted that materials used by his firm were approved by the housing authorities, and suggested the government may have not diligently checked the presence of prefabricated materials used in constructing other parts of the public housing projects. On 13 July 2015, after being identified by the WSD as being accountable for pipe work of Kai Ching Estate, licensed plumber Lam Tak-sum refuted HA's accusation, saying he was only responsible for the pipes connecting the water mains to water tanks of blocks, and that his scope excluded pipe work inside the flats and testing of water quality. However, Leung Chung-lap, assistant director of WSD, rebutted Lam's claim and said records showed that LP was also responsible for the pipelines into flats. Public disquiet further intensified after the press and public discovered throughout the following months of more and more instances of lead contamination, including in schools and on other premises. Of the 11 public rental housing estates with lead in water identified as of 10 September 2015, six were built by Yau Lee Construction Company, two by China State Construction Engineering (Hong Kong) Limited, two by Paul Y Engineering, and one by Shui on Group. However, the plumbing in public estates may be built by a subcontractor. In the case of Kai Ching Estate where the scandal began, the plumbing contractor was the Ho Biu Kei Construction & Engineering Company. The head of Ho Biu Kei responded that the construction materials he used were approved by the authorities, and that his company was only responsible for the plumbing on the outside of the building, not the plumbing in the flats. The interior plumbing comprises prefabricated components manufactured by Shenzhen Hailong Construction Products Co., Ltd., a subsidiary of China State Construction Engineering. On 25 September 2015 the Task Force on Excessive Lead in Drinking Water set up by the government released a preliminary finding that solder joints were the cause of the lead contamination, as previously asserted by the Water Supplies Department. The task force also found that copper alloy fittings leach lead, but not to an excessive degree. Elemental analysis of solder from Kai Ching Estate found it comprises up to 41 per cent lead, or 585 times the British Standard of 0.07 per cent. Helena Wong revealed in early November that Chief Secretary Carrie Lam and a Health Department official had separately asked Wong in July, shortly after she made her revelations, for the name of the laboratory that conducted the tests. Wong herself refused to identify the laboratory she mandated, and added that laboratories had received queries from the government, leading to fears that the government was attempting end the affair by putting pressure on laboratories not to perform any further tests. Contaminated buildings Kai Ching Estate water plumbing Kai Ching Estate temporary water supply Samples of water contaminated with lead have been identified at a range of public and private buildings of various ages, but especially in public housing estates constructed in the past decade. Individual buildings and institutions have commissioned water testing at their premises across the city. The government is conducting testing at many schools and public estates. Housing  Lead has been found in the water of numerous public housing estates, particularly those opened in the past decade. In addition to Kai Ching Estate, these include Kwai Luen Estate (Kwai Chung), Hung Hom Estate, Tung Wui Estate (Wong Tai Sin), Choi Fook Estate (Choi Wan), Un Chau Estate (Sham Shui Po), Ching Ho Estate (Sheung Shui), Lower Ngau Tau Kok Estate, and four other as of 10 September 2015. As of the same date, 64 other public housing developments were tested but no excessive lead contamination found. This does not necessarily clear these estates of the possibility of contamination, as the number of tests completed to date varies in each location and the testing has not been exhaustive of each housing block or drinking water tap. Lead contamination has also affected private residential developments. Property management company Savills Guardian conducted testing at The Caldecott, a luxury estate in Kowloon Tong built in 2004, and found 19 micrograms of lead per litre of water sourced from a kitchen tap. A water sample from The Austin, a newly built luxury development atop Austin Station, was found to contain 41 micrograms of lead per litre. Schools Lead contamination was discovered at numerous schools. SKH St. Thomas' Primary School in Sham Shui Po, the first case, where test results on potable water were 330% above WHO guidelines was disclosed by Apple Daily on 23 August. Another Kowloon school, St. Francis of Assisi's Caritas School (SFACS) in Shek Kip Mei, reported contamination above WHO standards in three out of five samples taken from its premises. One sample was found to contain 220 mg of lead per litre of water; two other samples, from the kitchen and canteen, were found to have 25 mg and 26 mg of lead per litre, respectively. This spurred the Hong Kong Professional Teachers' Union to urge the government to test water in all of Hong Kong schools, and give financial assistance and issue guidelines to schools opting to have their own water supply tested. However, Secretary for Education Eddie Ng refused, saying that as many schools had since installed water filters for their drinking fountains and faucets, and that students themselves had started bringing their own drinking water supplies, the government would prioritise water standards at public housing estates. The Baptist Rainbow Primary School in Wong Tai Sin announced the discovery of water contamination on 31 August 2015. It marked the first time that lead contamination had been found in an older building. The school was built in 1984. The English Schools Foundation collected more than 300 water samples for testing from its 21 schools across Hong Kong. It announced in September 2015 that samples from four schools (King George V School, Sha Tin College, South Island School, and West Island School) contained elevated levels of lead. The ESF subsequently shut off the sources of contaminated water. Reaction The lead contamination of water has resulted in a public outcry and intense media scrutiny.  Palliative measures  From 10 July, the government commenced supplying free bottled water to households in all affected estates, numbering 30,000 in total. It was subsequently revealed that some 6.5 million bottles of AS Watson water were supplied to affected residents up to end of October, at an estimated cost to the taxpayer of HK$40 million. In early November, Chief Secretary Carrie Lam announced that households affected by a tainted water would receive rebates of up to HK$660 (US$85) on their water bills. The four main water pipe contractors for the affected estates agreed to install temporary pipes and undertake permanent replacement at a total cost of HK$140 million as a gesture of goodwill. They also agreed to pay HK$20 million in compensation to affected tenants without any admission of responsibility.  Political reaction  Pre-empting the government confirmation of high concentration of lead at Kai Ching Estate, Chiang Lai-wan pro-establishment legislator from the DAB claimed that the Democratic Party's test results were scaremongering. Later, the media reported that her husband, Raymond Leung Hai-ming, was an independent non- executive director of China State Construction, the contractor of Kai Ching Estate. Chiang's speech led to a doubt on the involvement of conflict of interests in her position. Members of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong urged the government to thoroughly investigate the scandal. On 16 July 2015 Neo Democrats legislator Gary Fan Kwok-wai and Labour Party legislator Cyd Ho Sau-lan invoked Legislative Council (Powers and Privileges) Ordinance (PNP) to investigate the crisis. The motion was passed in geographical constituency by a margin of 3 votes but failed in the split voting arrangement with Functional Constituencies dominated by pro-establishment legislators. On 22 July 2015, the Democratic Party legislator Wu Chi-wai tabled the same motion on the LegCo panel on housing, but this was again rejected by the pro-establishment lawmakers by a margin of 11:8. On 13 August, the government appointed a Commission of Inquiry into Excess Lead Found in Drinking Water chaired by Mr Justice Andrew Chan. On 20 August, the Housing Authority's tender committee announced that it would delay the tendering process for construction of four new public housing estates. Some of the contractors bidding on these developments were blamed for causing lead contamination of water in previous estates they had built. As Secretary for Education Eddie Ng initially refused to test the water supply in all kindergartens or install water filters to help protect the health and welfare of highly vulnerable children, uproar only abated when Chief Secretary Carrie Lam announced on 3 September that tests would be conducted on supplies to kindergartens across the territory to ensure the safe potable water for the most vulnerable schoolchildren. The government's handling of the crisis caused CY Leung's support rate to hit a new low since he came to power in 2012. Results of a survey released in early September showed Leung was disapproved of across all demographics. Approvals amounted to 22 percent and disapprovals were at 62 percent ‚Äì a net popularity of negative 39 percentage points; similarly, the satisfaction rate for the HK government stood at 21 percent while its dissatisfaction rate was at 50 percent ‚Äì a net of negative 29 points. In September 2015, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) opened an investigation into whether corruption or abuse of power contributed to the lead contamination incident. The case was submitted to the ICAC by the Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood and People Power in July. In May 2016, after a one year long investigation, an inquiry commission formed by the government concluded that the incident has been a \\"collective\\" failure of numerous government departments. No specific person or department has been found guilty. On 11 July 2016, a meeting was held for LegCo House Committee to discuss \\"Report of the Commission of Inquiry into Excess Lead Found in Drinking Water\\" released by the government previously. Lawmakers condemned that, in light of the scandal, no government officials had stepped down under the current Principal Officials Accountability System, and Chief Secretary for Administration Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor even did not offer an apology. They criticised that the accountability system existed in name only.  Sanctions for contractors  Four main contractors were barred from tendering seven new projects involving construction of 18,000 flats under HA from March to September 2015. In August 2015, main contractors installed water filters for affected households and do the replacement or cleaning of water filters regularly. On 6 November 2015, the Tender Committee from the Housing Authority Committees suspended them from submitting tenders to one year. In November 2015, main contractors announced that they would pledge $20 million for paying the water bills of 29,000 affected households for about a year. Contractors were required to change all the pipes inside the affected households. The non-compliant water pipes in common areas of 11 affected public estates have been progressively replaced since March 2016, starting with Kwai Yuet House at Lower Ngau Tau Kok Estate on 17 October 2016.

It occurred during the Quit India Movement. The Tamralipta Jatiya Sarkar had set up Police Stations, Military Departments, Courts and even a system for revenue collection. The Government functioned from December 17, 1942 to August 8, 1944. It was dissolved on the explicit directions of Mahatma Gandhi, taking note of the end of the Quit India Movement. The chief protagonists were Satish Chandra Samanta, Sushil Kumar Dhara, Ajoy Mukherjee and Matangini Hazra.

He founded Chandos Records in 1979. Biography Born in Southend-on-Sea, Couzens was the son of Vera and William Couzens. His father worked for the Ford Motor Company in engine research, and his grandfather was a department store owner. He taught himself the trombone as a youth, performed in dance bands, and did his national service in the Royal Air Force band. Couzens arranged music for EMI and the BBC, including work for the latter's programme Friday Night is Music Night. His skills at arrangements came to the attention of Ron Goodwin, who hired Couzens to arrange one of his own film scores. The two subsequently collaborated on cinema scores over a period of about 10 years and over 30 films on scores, including such films as 633 Squadron (1964), Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines (1965) and Where Eagles Dare (1968). During this period, Couzens had founded his publishing house Chandos, which had a particular focus on music for brass bands. With newly gained experience from his film work, he expanded Chandos into an engineering and recording firm, with a mobile studio. As a freelance producer, he engineered recordings for labels such as RCA, recruiting his son Ralph into the business when the latter was age 16. In 1979, after the termination of his contract with RCA, Couzens formed Chandos Records as an independent record label, with his son as engineer and Janet Osbourne as designer. Chandos had hoped to distribute their recordings through EMI, but this arrangement did not come to fruition, which forced Couzens father and son to sell their records directly themselves across the UK. He made Chandos one of the earliest independent record labels to use digital recording technology in the early 1980s. In 2004, Couzens transferred day-to-day production duties to Ralph Couzens, and took the titles of chairman and senior producer for the label. Couzens received an honorary doctorate from the University of East Anglia in 2007, and a 'Special Achievement' honour from Gramophone in 2010. Couzens was married twice. His first marriage, to Isle Hauguth in 1956, lasted until her death in 2005, and produced four children, Ralph, Mark, Philip, and Isabella. His second marriage was to Deborah Frogel, in 2006. His four children and his second wife survive him. References External links * Rob Barnett, \\"30 Years of Chandos - An Interview with Brian and Ralph Couzens\\" (15 December 2008).

A wide range of care and support is offered at the hospice, based in the Vale of Glamorgan in south Wales, in the community, at hospital or in schools. On 14 October 2014, the Welsh charity hosted its first Research and Innovation Conference,https://www.wales.nhs.uk/sites3/events.cfm?orgid=970&id;=8218 in partnership with Cardiff University, at The Vale Resort. The event provided a showcase for the research and innovation projects of healthcare professionals and academics working in paediatric palliative care. History In 1988 Suzanne Goodall, a newly retired occupational therapist from Beddau in south Wales, felt compelled to bring a children's hospice to Wales and registered T≈∑ Hafan as a charity in 1990. In 1993, the site for the hospice building was acquired from Llandough NHS Hospital. The next few years saw huge support from the likes of the South Wales Echo, who launched an appeal, and Diana, Princess of Wales, who became the first patron of the Welsh charity. In 1995, on request from Princess Diana, Luciano Pavarotti performed a concert in Cardiff Castle to raise money for the charity. The building of the hospice started in 1996, and the completed building was handed over to T≈∑ Hafan for fitting and equipping in 1997. After much hard work and with the kindness and generosity of the public, T≈∑ Hafan opened its doors for the first time in 1999. In 2004, the Queen acknowledged Suzanne's achievement by investing her as an MBE in the New Year's Honours List. Beautiful Lives, a four-part BBC One documentary series aired in 2011, followed the lives of the children, families and staff of T≈∑ Hafan. A follow-up episode focusing on Catherine and Kirsty, teenage twins who use T≈∑ Hafan's services, aired in 2012. Events T≈∑ Hafan hosts a series of annual fundraising events, including the Welsh Three Peaks, the Rainbow Run and the Taff Trail Cycle Challenge. Patron and celebrity ambassadors The Prince of Wales became patron in 2001. Current celebrity ambassadors are Leigh Halfpenny, Rhodri and Lucy Owen, Mark Colbourne, John Barrowman, and Mark Wallace. Crackerjackpot hospice lottery Crackerjackpot Lottery in support of T≈∑ Hafan, is the largest hospice lottery in the UK. The weekly top prize is ¬£2,000, with a rollover jackpot of ¬£12,000.

He subsequently moved on to work on two other films, Motta Shiva Ketta Shiva (2017) and Shivalinga (2017). Lawrence revived the project in August 2017 and revealed he was finishing the script. The regular supporting cast of Kovai Sarala, Manobala, Sriman and Devadarshini were retained. Sun Pictures, who had recently produced who had previously produced Enthiran (2010), agreed to produce their film, marking their second production. In late September, the following actresses were added to the project: Oviya, following her popularity on the Tamil reality show Bigg Boss, Vedhika from the first film, and newcomer Nikki Tamboli. The shoot of the film began in Chennai during the first week of October 2017. Nivetha Joseph was the costume designer for this film. The movie was released on 19 April 2019.  Music  Raghava Lawrence further inked a deal with DooPaaDoo.com which is owned by lyricist Madhan Karky. It was revealed that the film will have songs from six independent music directors throughout the DooPaaDoo.com platform, with 2 of film's songs are composed by singer Saravedi Saran, while each one song will be composed by Sekar Sai Bharath, Jessie Samuel (who earlier sung one of the songs in the film Jarugandi), Bharath Madhusuthanan and the duo of Raj Thillaiyampalam-Kapilan Kugavel. The background music was composed by Thaman, who earlier composed for director's previous Kanchana and Kanchana 2 film.  Reception  The film was an average grosser at box office. The film received positive reviews from Wetalkiess. The dubbed Kannada version titled Kanchana 3 was panned by critics. Film Companion South wrote, \\"In theory, I am a fan of mixing humour and horror. I just wish they worked more on the writing. I can live with the non-existent craft in these films, but is it too much to ask a horror-comedy to have some quality horror and some quality comedy?\\"  Release  The movie was released on 19 April 2019.

It aired on Fox in the United States on December 7, 2014. Plot Bob's father, Big Bob, is throwing his annual Christmas party at his restaurant, Big Bob's Diner. Linda urges them all to go, though Bob and his father do not get along. Bob institutes a \\"15 Minute Rule\\", which represents his father's ability to say something offensive enough to him within 15 minutes that Bob cannot stand to be around him and must leave. Since he was a child working in Big Bob's Diner, his father has not understood nor respected his son's desire to make creative burgers. As a boy, the first time he made one (called the \\"Baby, You Can Chive My Car\\" Burger) for his father's regular, Henry, Big Bob threw it away and made Henry \\"the usual\\", a tuna melt, before Henry could have a taste. At the party, Big Bob is cooking for his customers. The kids greet their grandfather, then head to his basement to build Bob a last minute Christmas present out of Big Bob's basement junk. Meanwhile, Linda and Bob meet Big Bob's regulars: Henry, Max, and Pete, who owns the gay bar, The Junk Yard, next door. Learning that Big Bob is short staffed that night, Linda suggests that Bob help him in the kitchen in an attempt to get them to reconcile. Bob reluctantly does so, setting the 15 minute timer. The two trade awkward small talk. 20 years earlier, Big Bob's Christmas gift to \\"Little Bob\\", then a young man, was to reveal his plan to change the diner to \\"Big Bob & Son's Diner\\" and make Little Bob his business partner in front of all his friends and customers. However, Little Bob snaps, saying that he doesn't want to work with his father because he is rigid and puts down all his creative ideas. Humiliated in front of his friends, Big Bob angrily tells Little Bob to leave, which he does, storming out and saying he will start his own restaurant with creative, interesting burgers. Down in the basement of Big Bob's Diner, the kids' makeshift presents all fail, and with nothing else to give, they hastily wrap a snow globe with a newspaper in Big Bob's desk. Upstairs, Big Bob gruffly criticizes Bob's ability to make a simple grilled cheese just as the timer goes off. Linda then submits Henry's order: the usual. Seeing this as his chance to prove himself, Bob announces that he'll make Henry exactly the same burger he never got to try 20 years ago and that Henry can decide which of their food tastes better. The two men race to make their food and despite Big Bob's pleas, Henry ultimately gives in and eats Bob's burger, announcing how irresistibly delicious it is. Bob triumphantly gloats and Big Bob, humiliated once again, sadly tells Bob he won and leaves. Bob is immediately ashamed and when the kids give him their present, he sees that the newspaper has the first review of Bob's Burgers ever written. Realizing that his father saved it all these years, he goes with Pete next door to The Junk Yard, where Big Bob is sulking. The bar is having its Country Line Dance Night, and Bob is surprised to learn that his father has since taken up line dancing. The two talk it over during the line dance, with Bob expressing his frustrations, but recognizing that his father always loved him and even secretly supported him, and that it was wrong of him to embarrass him in front of his friends tonight and 20 years ago, even if he isn't sorry that he struck out on his own. His father admits that he understands why he had to leave and knows he is hard to work with, saying that things were hard after Bob's mother was no longer around. The two later stand outside the diner and see Linda and the kids running the restaurant in their absence. Big Bob tells Bob that he has a great family, happy kids, and is a good father, and the two rejoin the party to the customers' cheers. Big Bob wishes everyone a Merry Christmas. Reception Alasdair Wilkins of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B+, stating that ‚Äú'Father Of The Bob' then is a good example of why a show doesn‚Äôt need to be surprising to be successful. It‚Äôs entirely possible for an episode to be predictable and still good just as long as the episode finds satisfying ways to give us what we expect.\\" Robert Ham of Paste gave the episode a 9.2 out of 10, stating, \\"No show does heartwarming quite like Bob‚Äôs Burgers. Even when they‚Äôre hitting on the well-worn holiday themes of forgiveness and family togetherness, they balance that out with hilarious bits of weirdness...\\" The episode received a 1.6 rating and was watched by a total of 3.18 million people. This made it the fourth most watched show on Fox that night, behind Brooklyn Nine-Nine, Family Guy, and The Simpsons.

It is located 86 km south of Junagadh, 23 km from Sutrapada, and 386 km from the State capital Gandhinagar. The local language is Gujarati. History The village is said to have been re-peopled by KardiaKardia means a Rajput who subsists by labour or service, kar as contrasted with garas and Kardia with Garasia. Hamir of Sutrapada in 1839 and the population consists principally of Kardia Rajputs of the Barad, Mori, Jhankat, and Gohil tribes. But it was founded early in the fifteenth century by Raja or Garasia Bhuvad. Thus the tank is called the Bhuvad Talav ; and the writer gathers from a Sanskrit inscription that the tank was excavated by Bai Vagti, daughter of Bai Magti, wife of Raj Bharam of Barad race for the spiritual benefit of Shri Bhuvad, so probably Vagti was the widow of Bhuvad who was doubtless a Garasia of some adjacent village. The inscription mentions that it was inscribed in 1401 (Samvat 1457) in the victorious reign of Raj Shri Shivgan. This Shivgan was probably a Vaja ruler of Somnath. His name occurs also in the inscription at Phulka near Una, the date of which is 1389 (Samvat 1445) so that the two inscriptions clearly refer to the same Shivgan. In the village is a grove of Ravan Tad trees or the branched variety of the palm trees. Demographics The population according to the census of 1872 was 275 souls, but this number dwindled to 268 in 1881 consequent on the famine of 1878‚Äì79. Nearby villages are Pedhavada, Pransli, Fachariya, Arnej, and Solaj. There are temples of Bhudvagham, Amrutalayam, Sukhnath Mahadev, Ram and Hanuman in Bhuva Timbi.

It was released on 28 May 2012 on Night Slugs. It received critical praise, and has since been acclaimed as an influential release in UK dance music by publications such as The Quietus and Fact. Background and production The press release for Classical Curves, published by Night Slugs in April 2012, detailed it as being 'a record that owes equal parts to Philly Club as it does to Laurie Anderson, The Neptunes as it does to Einst√ºrzende Neubauten, Steve Poindexter as it does to the soft jazz leads of Pat Metheny. It detailed Jam City's own atmospheric intents, noting almost synesthetic details about its musical textures and sound palette. > We are engulfed in booming, monolithic kick drums/We are floating on a pink > cloud. We are thrashed and contorted by sheets of metal/We are suspended in > breathy quiet of sighing voices and raindrops kissing the windowpane ‚Äì and > then it erupts again. Jam City aimed to tailor his productions towards the club environment, noting \\"...when you‚Äôre forced to experience that in a club it brings it to life in a totally different way, and I think the more you go to clubs and hear music on a really loud soundsystem, the more you‚Äôre able to try and write music for that environment. You think about space and shape a bit more.\\" On this basis, he attempted to \\"make [his music] more and more minimal\\". He also noted that he was becoming fascinated by the 'aesthetics of wealth and the modern world', \\"like mansions in Beverly Hills or Dubai. I don‚Äôt even know how I‚Äôd begin to make a club track that sounded like some mansion in the Hollywood Hills, but it‚Äôs just an easy starting point\\" and that this interest fed into his productions.Jam City Dummy Mag Interview The resulting glossy, post-dubstep sound established Jam City's reputation for creating instrumentals from club music tropes. Multiple tracks on Classical Curves such as 'Her', 'The Courts' and 'How We Relate to the Body' use staccato-based rhythms directly inspired by Jersey club music. Critical reception Classical Curves appeared in multiple end-of-year lists and received positive review from the press. Rory Gibb of The Quietus called it \\"one of the most interesting album-length listens to come from a UK club producer in a while, [...] a reminder that many sub-heavy dancefloors post-dubstep ought often to be demanding more for their money.\\"The Quietus Fact magazine's Tom Lea said \\"Both Classical Curves and Girl Unit‚Äôs recent Club Rez feel like they could mark the start of a new stage for Night Slugs.

In an interview with The Quietus, Night Slugs head Bok Bok said \\"I would like to state that I think it's really nice that people are becoming aware of this album's long term influence... It's interesting, I can play a whole set of tracks that basically rip off two or three key tracks on Classical Curves.

They were developed from blue-light receptors (so called LOV-domains) found in plants and various bacteria. They complement the GFP-derivatives and ‚Äìhomologues and are particularly characterized by their independence of molecular oxygen and their small size. FbFPs absorb blue light and emit light in the cyan-green spectral range.  Development  LOV-domains are a sub- class of PAS domains and were first identified in plants as part of Phototropin, which plays an essential role in the plant's growth towards light. They noncovalently bind Flavin mononucleotide (FMN) as coenzyme. Due to the bound FMN LOV-domains exhibit an intrinsic fluorescence, which is however very weak. Upon illumination with blue light, LOV-domains undergo a photocyle, during which a covalent bond is formed between a conserved cysteine-residue and the FMN. This causes a conformational change in the protein that is necessary for signal propagation and also leads to the loss of fluorescence. The covalent bond is energetically unfavorable and is cleaved with a protein specific time constant ranging from seconds to hours. In order to make better use of the fluorescence properties of these proteins, the natural photocycle of these LOV-domains was abolished by exchanging the conserved cysteine against an alanine on a genetic level. Thus, upon blue light irradiation, the protein remains in the fluorescent state and also exhibits a brighter fluorescence. The first FbFPs that were generated in this fashion were subsequently further optimized using different methods of mutagenesis. Especially the brightness but also the photostability of the proteins were enhanced and their spectral characteristics altered.  Spectral characteristics  Typical excitation and emission spectrum of FMN-binding fluorescent proteins (FbFPs) Typically FbFPs have an excitation maximum at a wavelength of approximately 450 nm (blue light) and a second distinct excitation peak around 370 nm (UV-A light). The main emission peak is at approx. 495 nm, with a shoulder around 520 nm. One variant of Pp2FbFP (Q116V) exhibits a 10 nm blue shift in both the excitation and emission spectra.  Photophysical properties  The photophysical properties of the FbFPs are determined by the chromophore itself and its chemical surrounding in the protein. The extinction coefficient (Œµ) is around 14.200 M‚àí1cm‚àí1 at 450 nm for all described FbFPs, which is slightly higher than that of free FMN (Œµ = 12.200 M‚àí1cm‚àí1 .). The Fluorescence-Quantum yield (Œ¶) varies significantly between different FbFPs and ranges from 0.2 (phiLOV2.1) to 0.44 (EcFbFP and iLOV). This represents an almost twofold increase compared to free FMN (Œ¶ = 0.25). The difference to free FMN is even more significant in the case of the photostabaility, the proteins resistance to bleach out during prolonged and intense irradiation with blue light. Based on the bleaching-halftime (the times it takes to reduce the initial fluorescence intensity to 50% upon illumination) the genetically engineered variant phiLOV2.1 is approximately 40x as stable as free FMN. This stabilizing effect can be observed for almost all FbFPs, although it is usually in the range of 5x - 10x. The average fluorescence lifetime of FbFPs is in the range of 3.17 (Pp2FbFP) and 5.7 ns (e.g. EcFbFP). They are thereby much longer than the ones of GFP derivatives, which are usually between 1,5 and 3 ns. FbFPs are therefore well suited as donor domains in F√∂rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) systems in conjunction with GFP derivatives like YFP as acceptor domains.  Advantages and disadvantages  The main advantage of FbFPs over GFP is their independence of molecular oxygen. Since all GFP derivatives and homologues require molecular oxygen for the maturation of their chromophore, these fluorescent proteins are of limited use under anaerobic or hypoxic conditions. Since FbFPs bind FMN as chromophore, which is synthesized independently of molecular oxygen, their fluorescence signal does not differ between aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Another advantage is the small size of FbFPs, which is typically between 100 and 150 amino acids. This is about half the size of GFP (238 amino acids). It could for example be shown that this renders them superior tags for monitoring tobacco mosaic virus infections in tobacco leaves. Due to their extraordinary long average fluorescence lifetime of up to 5.7 ns they are also very well suited for the use as donor domains in FRET systems in conjunction with e.g. YFP (see photophysical properties). A fusion of EcFbFP and YFP was e.g. used to develop the first genetically encoded fluorescence biosensor for oxygen (FluBO) The main disadvantage compared to GFP variants is their lower brightness (the product of Œµ and Œ¶). The commonly used EGFP (Œµ = 55,000 M‚àí1cm‚àí1; Œ¶ = 0.60 ) for example is approximately five times as bright as EcFbFP. Another disadvantage of the FbFPs is the lack of color variants to tag and distinguish multiple proteins in a single cell or tissue. The largest spectral shift reported for FbFPs so far is 10 nm. Although this variant (Pp2FbFP Q116V) can be visually distinguished from the others with the human eye, the spectral differences are too small for fluorescence microscopy filters.

It has egg-shaped, twisted leaves and heads, or short spikes of white or creamy- white flowers in December. It is classified as a threatened species. Description Melaleuca tortifolia is a shrub growing to about tall. Its leaves are arranged in more or less opposite pairs and are long, wide, egg- shaped with the end tapering to a point. The leaves are flat but usually twisted, with 3 to 5 longitudinal veins. The flowers are white, pale cream or pink in colour and are arranged in heads or short spikes on the ends of branches that continue to grow after flowering. The heads contain 2 to 10 groups of flowers in threes and are up to in diameter but sometimes the flowers may be in small groups of individual flowers. The petals are long and fall off as the flower ages. The stamens are in five bundles around the flowers, each bundle containing 10 to 16 stamens. Flowering usually occurs in December and is followed by the fruit which are woody, almost spherical capsules in diameter.Melaleuca tortifolia growing on Mount Barren Taxonomy and naming Melaleuca tortifolia was first formally described in 1984 by Norman Byrnes in Austrobaileya. The specific epithet (tortifolia) is from the Latin tortus meaning \\"twist\\" or \\"turn\\" and folium meaning \\"a leaf\\" referring to the often twisted leaves. Distribution and habitat Melaleuca tortifolia is only known from Barren Mountain near Ebor where it grows in heath in wet places. Conservation Melaleuca tortifolia is a threatened species listed as 2Rc-t in the ROTAP classification, meaning that it is rare but without any identifiable threat, and all the known individual plants are in a conservation reserve.

It was one of the oldest naval hospitals in the United States, having operated from 1838 to 1948. Two of the structures in the former hospital's site are designated New York City Landmarks. The entire hospital complex is listed on the National Register of Historic Places along with the rest of the Navy Yard. History Establishment and operation The first hospital at the Brooklyn Navy Yard was established within the main shipyard. However, its facilities were described as inadequate; an 1811 letter described the hospital as being in a pond that flooded during high tide, and without any sterile lining to prevent disease transmission. In 1824, the Secretary of the Navy purchased a dedicated tract for a new Brooklyn Naval Hospital. This plot was not connected to the rest of the Navy Yard at the time. The hospital was established the following year. At the time the hospital was constructed, the area was still largely rural, and its buildings secluded from the developed sections of Brooklyn. The hospital's main building was not actually completed until 1838, with additional wings added two years later. A pharmaceutical laboratory was added to the main property in 1853; the building no longer exists. E. R. Squibb, the inventor of the anesthetic ether, was the first person to run the laboratory. He worked on improving a distillation method for ether during his tenure at the hospital until he left in 1857. Shortly afterward, when the American Civil War broke out, Squibb provided drugs to the Naval Hospital from his laboratory on nearby Furman Street. The Brooklyn Naval Hospital was active from the American Civil War through World War II. At first, the hospital treated sailors and dock workers, and had a capacity of 125 beds which could hold 150 patients. The Brooklyn Naval Hospital became the main hospital in the United States Navy's hospital system in the 1850s. The two-story Surgeon's House was completed in 1863. It was estimated that during the course of the Civil War, the hospital treated almost a quarter of all Union casualties, and annexes were built so the hospital could treat up to 450 patients at once. After the war, the hospital also started treating civilians. By the end of the 19th century, the mud flats separating the hospital and the rest of the Brooklyn Navy Yard were filled in and developed. Work on a new wing to the original building began in 1895, and was completed in 1900. By 1904, the Brooklyn Naval Hospital was ranked one of the best civilian hospitals in the U.S. Two quarters numbered 2 and 3 were built for medical staff in 1905. A medical supply depot was completed circa 1910, and a lumber shed was completed in 1910. The medical supply depot later became an officer's quarters, while the lumber shed was later converted into a morgue. By 1913, the quarters for the officer in command of the medical supply depot was being converted into a facility for patients with contagious diseases. In 1915, three small brick quarters buildings numbered 5 through 7 were built at the hospital's northwestern edge, away from the existing buildings. This was done in an effort to quarantine anyone with contagious diseases. Circa 1917, the United States' entry into World War I necessitated further expansion of the hospital. The original hospital building's capacity was doubled to 600 with the construction of a new wing, and the supply depot was moved to Sands Street so the former supply depot building could be converted into additional facilities for patients. A nurses' quarters, with capacity for 130 nurses, was built in 1919 at the northern boundary of the hospital grounds. An additional wing for the original building opened in 1920. These improvements, along with four additional buildings that no longer exist, allowed the hospital to accommodate 3,000 patients at a time during World War I. After World War I ended, the number of patients declined until 1938 (just before World War II), when a national emergency was declared. In preparation for World War II, the Works Progress Administration refurbished the Naval Hospital's 37 buildings, although no new structures were built. The hospital accommodated 65,197 patients over the course of the war. The Navy's first Cardiac Consultation Service was founded at the hospital in 1941. The Brooklyn branch of the Red Cross Service, also helped the hospital's patients with rehabilitation activities. Closure In April 1948, after the war ended, the Navy announced that it would be closing the Brooklyn Naval Hospital. Despite objections from U.S. Representative James J. Heffernan, the hospital was officially decommissioned on June 30, 1948. Most of the hospital's patients were relocated to the St. Albans Naval Hospital, a newly constructed facility in St. Albans, Queens. Subsequently, the hospital was converted into the United States Naval Receiving Annex, Brooklyn. Some of the buildings were to be repurposed into additional housing. After the greater Navy Yard was decommissioned in the 1960s, the Navy retained the former hospital buildings as administrative structures until 1989. The structures are largely in the same state as they had been since abandonment. However, several buildings had been demolished during the late 20th century. Skeletons in the former hospital's cemetery were rediscovered in 1997 during a survey. Two years later, a report on the cemetery was published. In 2012, Steiner Studios proposed to build a media campus at the former hospital site. The Naval Hospital campus would be an annex to the existing Steiner Studios lot, located just west of Brooklyn Naval Hospital. Steiner Studios planned to restore the hospital buildings starting in 2017, and restoration was expected to take nearly a decade. The extant buildings included the main building, surgeon's house, quarters 4 through 7, bachelors' and nurses' quarters, carriage houses and stables, the medical supply depot, and the morgue/lumber shed. Steiner proposed to convert these structures into production, post-production, and production support space. The hospital, along with the rest of the Navy Yard, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in 2014. The Steiner Studios plan calls for the restoration of 15 NRHP-listed buildings at the Brooklyn Naval Hospital campus, but would also demolish some of the NRHP- contributing artifacts to make way for the new facility. Structures with a total floor area of would be demolished and replaced with landscaped lawn space. Notable structures Main building Side view of the main hospital building The Brooklyn Naval Hospital's main building is Building R95, a , 2-story Greek Revival structure with a granite facade. The building was designed by Martin E. Thompson. The front portion of the building was built starting in 1830 and was completed in 1838. Two wings were completed in 1840, and were attached to the front section in a rough \\"E\\" shape. The long side of the \\"E\\" contains a symmetrical portico recessed into the walls and surrounded by eight 2-story-tall stone Doric piers. The front portico, facing west onto Hospital Road, contains ten bays while the sides each contain nine bays, and there are twelve-over-twelve-pane double-sash windows with wooden frames on all elevations of the building. Additional entrances are located on the sides of the building, and a second portico. During the Civil War, a temporary wooden annex with capacity for another 300 patients was added, though this annex might have once treated 500 patients simultaneously. The wooden annex was torn down at the end of the war. Two additional wings were added in 1900 and 1920 but were also demolished; the original building and the two 1840 wings remain. The structure was made a New York City designated landmark in 1965. The building was cited as a \\"rare surviving example of early institutional design\\" in the city's landmark report. Surgeon's House A two-story Surgeon's House (Building R1), designed in the French Second Empire style, was built in 1863 by builder True W. Rollins and civil engineer Charles Hastings. The entrance to the house is symmetrical and contains a small pair of steps to a large doorway, with segmental arches and balustrades on either side of the entryway. The facade of the house contains a variety of window designs, including a large bay window on the north side of the first floor, and segmental arch windows on the second floor and at the front side of the first floor. There are sixteen rooms in the house itself, as well as a servant's quarters. The house also contains a Mansard roof with a full-height attic, as well as dormer windows from the attic that stick out from the slope of the roof. A curved driveway leads from the main entrance. The Surgeon's House is also a New York City designated landmark, having been marked as such in 1976. Cemetery The hospital's official cemetery, the U.S. Naval Hospital Cemetery, was established in 1831. The hospital's cemetery stopped burying soldiers in 1910, when it had reached its burial capacity. In 1926, Congress provided funding for the decommissioning of the U.S. Naval Hospital Cemetery. Subsequently, 987 soldiers' graves were exhumed and re-interred at Cypress Hills Cemetery. A park on the hospital cemetery's site, the Naval Cemetery Landscape, was opened in May 2016. Other structures A two-story brick carriage house, Building R103, was built around 1900. It contained two garage slots on the first floor, and a second story with rectangular windows and stone windowsills with flush lintels. The carriage building contained single-paneled wooden doors at the side and rear of the building, as well as a second-story entrance on the east side that was accessed by a no-longer-extant stair. A gable-roofed brick annex, Building R109, is attached to the carriage house. It is located on a slope, with two stories on the lower eastern side and one story on the higher western side of the building. There are segmental arched windows on the longer elevations of the building, as well as a garage with sliding wooden doors on the southern side. Quarters 4, also known as Building R4, was built in 1864 and served several purposes. It was a surgeon's residence until 1903, a directors' residence from 1903 to 1919, a nurses' quarters in 1919, and a sick officers' quarters after 1920. Quarters 4 was built in the Italianate style, with two wings. The asymmetrical three-story gable-roofed main building contains a single-pane wooden door at its front entrance, and six-over-six and two-over-four-sash windows with round arches at the top of each window. The third story was not included in the building's original construction, as it was built in 1917. A two-story wing is attached to the north facade and contains an entrance with segmental arches, as well as rectangular windows. A balcony runs along all three stories on the west side the building and was constructed around 1947; it contains one-over-one windows with metal frames. The medical supply depot (Building RD) was based on a design by architect Ernest Flagg. The design was similar to that of the naval hospital at the United States Naval Academy (which Flagg also designed), with a slightly utilitarian buff-colored brick facade, a hip roof, and classical- style elements. The lumber shed (Building R426) also had a hip roof, but was one story high and located near the original hospital building's eastern wall. The lumber shed was later converted into a morgue.

Fans may be mobilized to support such causes in response to celebrity endorsements; however, activists may also leverage content worlds and fan-like activities as resources to be reconfigured for political engagement, as in the cases where real-life rights groups have used imagery and tropes from Avatar (2009 film) to attract mainstream media attention in the West Bank village of Bil'in and Orissa, India. Notable groups that are associated with fan activism include the Harry Potter Alliance, Fans4Writers, Nerdfighteria and the Organization for Transformative Works.  History of Fan Activism  Fan activism was originally geared toward fans wanting to save their favorite television shows. For example, in 1969, Bjo and John Trimble led a letter-writing campaign to \\"save Star Trek\\" to guarantee the show survived more series. More recently, Stargate SG-1 fans quickly responded on the Internet to rumor of the show's cancellation. In this case, they were able to use information found on various websites to figure out how networks made decisions regarding TV shows and argued for its continuation. There is some debate whether or not this fan activism represents traditional activism. While fan activism is considered to be a form of cultural activism by fans and some political scientists, it is often overlooked in literature, \\"suggesting a residual distinction between high and low culture\\". Gene Roddenberry provided a strong base base for fan activists when he connected a utopian and humanist philosophy with science fiction and further used science fiction to support gender and racial equality. The rise of fan activism has been attributed to the emergence of new media, and is described as \\"not about the mix between political concerns and culture but rather action that looks like political activism but is used toward nonpolitical ends.\\" Nevertheless, a 2012 quantitative study by Kahne, Feezell, and Lee suggests that there may be a statistically significant relationship between youths' participation in interest-driven activities online and their civic engagement later on in life.\\" Most recently, there has been a connection made between the students of the MarchForOurLives movement and Dumbledore's Army from the Harry Potter series.  Fan Activist Groups  There are several fan activist groups that have created platforms to promote social change. The three that have attracted a significant amount of research include the Harry Potter Alliance, The Racebending Movement, and the Nerdfighters.  Harry Potter Alliance  The Harry Potter Alliance (HPA) consists of more than 100,000 members who support several causes including Doctors for Health, Free Press, and The Gay-Straight Alliance. This movement, which was established in 2005 by its non-profit leader Andrew Slack, parallels Harry Potter's endeavors to combat Voldemort to the broader society's goals to challenge dominant power structures that oppress marginalized groups. The HPA has been active in its strides toward providing financial relief toward populations in need. For example, following the 2010 Haiti Earthquake, the HPA assembled to raise approximately $123,000 to provide five cargo planes that supplied medical resources to the country following this momentous event. The HPA also organizes its members into four Hogwarts houses to strengthen group solidarity and encourage members to spread awareness about social and political issues. Like in Harry Potter, these houses compete to earn points based on their abilities to inspire change and encourage direct action.  The Racebending Movement  Following the release of the 2010 live-action film, The Last Airbender, the Racebending Movement emerged to promote racial diversity in the Hollywood film industry. The film received criticism for casting white actors as the main characters who came from predominately Asian heritage. As a form of protest against the whitewashing of non-white characters, a community of fans created the Racebending.com website to advocate the fair representation of minority groups. On this site, a large number of users post comments that instigate debates among active community members. This movement also has a strong presence on Tumblr where users cast people of color as traditionally white characters such as Bruce Wayne, Hermoine Granger, and Luke Skywalker.  Nerdfighters  Hank and John Green created the Nerdfighters community in 2007 after gaining popularity from their Brotherhood 2.0 project where each brother posted a video to YouTube every other day for a year. Unlike fan activist groups such as the Harry Potter Alliance and the Racebending movement, the Nerdfighters community does not dedicate its efforts only toward promoting change. Rather, this community has a multifaceted creative output that incorporates music, fiction, and other forms of media with challenges, pranks, and games. The activities of the Nerdfighters community derive themselves from the work and interests of Hank and John Green; for example, the community's Positive Pranking Project consists of pranks that are similar to those found in John Green's novels Paper Towns and Looking for Alaska. The commonalities that appear between Green's books and the Nerdfighters include the objectives of establishing an environment that reinforces respect for others, intellectual and philosophical beliefs, linguistic play, and the goal to make world a better place for everyone.

An increasing number of studies have recently explored the relationship between intelligence and personality, in particular the Big Five personality traits. General relationship Intelligence and personality have some common features; for example, they both follow a relatively stable pattern throughout the whole of one‚Äôs life, which is genetically determined in different degrees. In addition, they are both significant predictors of various outcomes, such as educational achievement, occupational performance, and health. However, the traditional view in psychology is that there is no meaningful relationship between personality and intelligence and they should be studied as separate entities. Firstly, intelligence is considered to be a cognitive process, while personality is recognised as being non-cognitive, and this implies that there is a great distinction between personality and intelligence. However, other psychologists argue that the distinction between cognitive and non-cognitive is vague because almost all personality traits have cognitive attributes, although they are more obvious in some traits than in others. For example, neuroticism is a personality trait, but is also related to rumination and compulsive thinking about possible threats, while agreeableness is associated with understanding and considering the mental state of others. In addition, different methods are generally used to assess intelligence and personality. Intelligence is normally measured by means of ability tests, whereas personality is usually assessed by means of questionnaires. Furthermore, different typical measurements lead to another conceptual distinction, which is that intelligence is considered to indicate individuals‚Äô maximal performance, while personality is believed to reflect their typical behaviour. However, others argue that multiple methods can be used to assess intelligence and personality; for example, questionnaires that require to be rated by self, peers or observers can also be used to measure individuals‚Äô mental ability, although these kinds of measurement may lack accuracy. Therefore, different typical methods cannot prove that the relationship between intelligence and personality is a meaningless one. In addition, since individuals‚Äô ability can also affect their typical behaviour, IQ can predict outcomes related to aspects such as performance at work, academic achievement, and health. Therefore, ability tests can provide indices of both maximal performance and typical behaviour. By personality trait Openness/Intellect Openness shows the strongest positive relationship with g among the Big Five personality traits, ranging from r=.06 to r=.42. Individuals with a high level of openness enjoy the experience of learning and prefer an intellectually stimulating environment. Therefore, openness shows a significant moderate association with crystallized intelligence (r=.30), but a non-significant low association with fluid intelligence (r=.08), and these results are consistent with those of other studies. Some psychologists have recently pointed out that previous instruments used to measure openness actually assessed two distinctive aspects. The first is intellect, which reflects intellectual engagement and perceived intelligence and is marked by ideas, while the second is emotion, which reflects the artistic and contemplative qualities related to being engaged in sensation and perception and is marked by fantasy, aesthetics, feelings and actions. On this basis, intellect was found to be associated with the neural system of the working memory, which is related to g, whereas openness was not. In addition, according to a study of genetic behaviour, intellect is genetically closer to intelligence than openness. Conscientiousness The association between conscientiousness and intelligence is complex and uncertain. Individuals with a lower level of intelligence are always assumed to tend to behave in an orderly fashion and do extra work, which is related to being conscientious, in order to compensate for their lower level of cognitive ability. However, although intelligence has been observed to be negatively correlated with conscientiousness in some studies, others have not found this correlation to be significant and have even found a positive relationship. Furthermore, some interaction has been found between conscientiousness and intelligence. Conscientiousness has been found to be a stronger predictor of safety behaviour in individuals with a low level of intelligence than in those with a high level. This interaction may also be found in educational and occupational settings in future studies. Therefore, relatively speaking, an increase in either conscientiousness or intelligence may compensate for a deficiency in the other. Extraversion The results of a meta-analysis research conducted in 1997, which consisted of 35 studies, indicated that there is a very small, but statistically significant positive correlation between extraversion and g (r=.08). Another recent meta-analysis of extraversion, which comprised 50 new studies, reported a similar correlation (r=.05). There are some moderating variables in the relationship between extraversion and g including differences in the assessment instruments and samples‚Äô age and sensory stimulation; for example, no meaningful correlation was found between extraversion and intelligence in the samples of children. Furthermore, Bates and Rock (2004) used Raven‚Äôs matrices and found that extraverts performed better than introverts with increasing auditory stimulation, whereas introverts performed best in silence. This result is consistent with that of Revelle et al. (1976). In addition, different measures and different sub-traits of extraversion have been found to cause significantly different correlations. Neuroticism Neuroticism has been found to have a reliable negative association with g(r=-.33). However, other researchers have recently reported a lower coefficient of .09 for general mental ability and emotional stability. Although these studies have some differences, they all indicate that intelligence increases with a decrease in negative emotion. One of the reasons for this negative correlation is Test anxiety, which refers to the psychological distress experienced by individuals prior to, or during, an evaluative situation. This is closely associated with neuroticism and has a negative influence on individuals‚Äôperformance in an intelligence test (r=-.23). Some argue that all the aforementioned evidence indicates that neuroticism is related to test performance rather than true intelligence. However, according to the results of a longitudinal study recently conducted by Gow et al., (2005), neuroticism influences an age-related decline in intelligence and there is a small negative correlation between neuroticism and a change in the level of IQ (r=-.18). Although it is still debatable if neuroticism reduces general intelligence, this study provided some valuable evidence and a direction for research. In addition, some interaction between intelligence and neuroticism has been found. Individuals with a high level of neuroticism demonstrated a poor performance, health, and adjustment only if they had a low level of intelligence. Therefore, intelligence may act as a buffer and compensate neuroticism in individuals. Agreeableness No significant association between agreeableness and g has been found in previous research. However, some components of agreeableness have been found to be related to intelligence. For example, aggression is negatively associated with intelligence (r is around -.20) because unintelligent people may experience more frustration, which may lead to aggression and aggression and intelligence may share some biological factors. In addition, emotional perception and emotional facilitation, which are also components of agreeableness, have been found to be significantly correlated with intelligence. This may be because emotional perception and emotional facilitation are components of emotional intelligence and some researchers have found that emotional intelligence is a Second-Stratum Factor of g.

Allen was the son of William Allen, a master in the navy and presumably a follower of Admiral Sir Robert Calder. He entered the navy as a second-class volunteer in July 1827. In that grade and as second master he served with credit, principally on the west coast of Africa and in China. In 1841 he was advanced to be master, and in 1842-44 was master of the Dido, with Sir Henry Keppel, in her celebrated cruises against the Malay pirates of Borneo. In 1850-51, he was master of the Resolute in the Arctic, under Captain Austin, whom he followed from the Blenheim, and was in charge of the magnetic observations. In 1854-55 he was master of the Hogue blockship in the Baltic, and rendered efficient service by his survey, often under fire, of the approaches to Bomarsund. In 1863 he was promoted to the then new rank of staff-commander, and in 1867 to that of staff-captain. In 1866-67 he was master-attendant and harbour-master at Malta; and in 1867 was appointed in the same capacity to Devonport, from where he was transferred to Deptford. When that dockyard was closed in October 1870, he retired with the rank of captain. He was a silent, thoughtful man, singularly modest and retiring. The subordinate position in which so much of his service was passed prevented his name from coming prominently before the public; but in the navy his reputation as a sound and skilful navigator and pilot stood very high, and was officially recognised in his nomination to C.B. in 1877. He died in London in 1903. Personal life Allen married twice. His first wife brought him a daughter and four sons, who all entered the public service, navy, army, or marines.

He was President of the Indigenous Social Justice Association (ISJA), and a prominent campaigner for the rights of Indigenous Australians. Early life Ray Jackson was a member of the Stolen Generations. In 1943, when Jackson was two years old, his father was killed in World War II, fighting Japanese forces on the Kokoda Track. Jackson said that instead of his biological mother receiving a war widows pension, the Australian government removed her four children (including Jackson) from her custody due to her Aboriginality. His name was changed and he was sent to a Catholic institution for a year, before being adopted by a white family. It was not until his teen years that he discovered he had been adopted. He never found his biological family, and never learned the original name they had given him. Activism Jackson was one of Australia's most prominent and knowledgeable campaigners on the issue of Aboriginal deaths in custody. He campaigned for justice for the families of victims, Eddie Murray, Mark Mason and TJ Hickey. Between 1991 and 1997, Jackson was coordinator of the Aboriginal Deaths in Custody Watch Committee, which was financed by the government agency, ATSIC. In an interview published by Green Left Weekly, Jackson said: > \\"We were so well set we had a hotline any blackfella could call, anytime. If > a copper so much as verballed a black kid, we'd get a call and be out at the > police station, no matter where it was ‚Äî at the latest ‚Äî a day later, > interrogating them.\\" However, when the government led by Prime Minister John Howard cut all funding to the committee, Jackson established the Indigenous Social Justice Association (ISJA) to continue the work. Jackson's small Waterloo apartment was full of shelves and folders containing meticulous records about Aboriginal deaths in custody. He would attend the scenes where people had died at the hands of police, and represent the deceased's families when dealing with the police and authorities. In December 2013, the French government agency Commission nationale consultative des droits de l'homme awarded Jackson's Indigenous Social Justice Association a prize of 70,000 euros (US$95,100) in recognition of its contribution to human rights. Jackson was responsible for hundreds of rallies and actions, especially in remembrance of lost lives to injustices. Jackson confronted police annually in enabling the TJ Hickey January marches from Redfern where he died to NSW Parliament in the heart of the City of the Sydney. Jackson was often a speaker at protest rallies for Aboriginal rights. Affectionately known as Uncle Ray, he would always attend the rallies wearing in his trademark black cap, decorated with social justice pins. He was a prominent supporter of the Redfern Aboriginal Tent Embassy, and was a familiar sight there up until his death. Death In the months before his death, Ray Jackson had not been feeling well, and a week before his death he was hospitalised with pneumonia. Shortly after attending a meeting of the Indigenous Social Justice Association, he died peacefully in his sleep on 23 April 2015. His granddaughter found him in bed that day in his Waterloo flat. At Jackson's request, his body was donated to the University of Sydney.

In 1936, the London County Council tried to rename the street Marylebone High Street, along with Thayer Street and James Street so that the whole north-south route from Oxford Street to Marylebone Road would have the same name. The proposal was opposed by the shopkeepers and small traders of the other streets who worried about the cost of the change, possible customer confusion, and the association with Marylebone Road rather than the closer Oxford Street. The occupants of Mandeville Place felt that they did not want to lose the higher class associations of Oxford Street in order to be associated with shopkeepers, and the prestige of the Mandeville Place was particularly useful for members of the medical profession resident in the street.

The movement uses cowbell and bicycle pedals to portray the sound of coal falling into the breakers and uses the rhythm to encompass more of a 'rock feel' to the piece. ::In this movement, Julia Wolfe uses a speech by John L. Lewis who fought for safe working conditions for these miners. ::This movement was created and inspired by an interview conducted with Barbara Powell, the daughter and granddaughter of miners. In an interview, she stated, ‚ÄúWe all had gardens‚Äù and began listing flower names. ::The words used in this movement were taken from a coal-powered railroad ad; coal during the 20th century was a fuel source for the nation, and this is the movement's theme. The movement ends with the story of Phoebe Snow, a historical railway advertising character, traveling to Buffalo while her \\"gown stays white from morn till night\\" ‚Äì a quote from the railway company's advertising campaign. Composition Anthracite Fields runs approximately an hour and combines elements of folk and classical music. Its libretto contains various oral histories, speeches, interviews, advertisements, and other texts from the history of the region. On her inspiration and research for the composition, Wolfe wrote: Analysis of \\"Flowers\\" The fourth movement \\"Flowers\\" is the brighter or less ominous movement of the oratorio. The form of the fourth movement could be argued to be in an A B C form. The entire composition is a minimalist piece making the exact transitions difficult to define. Minimalist pieces have great repetition and change chords within the piece slowly. It is much the case for ‚ÄúFlowers.‚Äù The piece starts with a guitar playing repeated sixteenth notes and the vocal part slowly repeating ‚Äúwe all had flowers.‚Äù The instruments change slightly in rhythm for the entire first half of the song which is barely noticed. The changes are small and it‚Äôs usually a change in rhythm from playing on beat one to instead starting on a different beat. The vocal parts also change their rhythm splitting up the word ‚Äúflower‚Äù into smaller beats. While all this is happening the chordal structure still remains in the same area. It isn't until measure 70 that a major change is seen. At that point, the first thing to be noticed is the lyrics that now start naming off flower names instead of the repeating ‚Äúflower‚Äù over and over. The guitar also returns in a new triplet rhythm giving the section a different feel from what was there before. This section also grows in small increments to the C section of the piece. The soprano lines start lengthening starting at measure 106 and keeps elongating the flower names ever so slightly until a change is heard at 123. Both soprano lines start holding their lines over two measures. The notes slow down much like how the beginning sounded but the lyrics and instruments are performing rhythms much different from what the listener first hears. It clearly a different section of the piece and continued it until the very end of the composition. The rhythm throughout the movement shows a cycle. From beginning to end, the movement starts in longer rhythms but as the piece continues, the rhythms become more condensed, sporadic, and returns to longer rhythms in the end. The vocal lines ‚ÄúWe all had flowers‚Äù and ‚ÄúWe all had gardens‚Äù have longer notes such as half notes and quarter notes. For the word ‚Äúflower‚Äù specifically, the ‚Äúflo‚Äù has two quarter notes that are tied and ‚Äúwers‚Äù is a dotted half note tied to a whole note. As the piece continues, that the idea of ‚Äúflo‚Äù being shorter in rhythm while ‚Äúwers‚Äù remains longer appears even when the rhythmic value of the notes has changed. As an example, measure 22 has ‚Äúflo‚Äù being a tied eighth note to a quarter note and ‚Äúwers‚Äù has a quarter tied to a dotted quarter. This pattern remains prominent until measure 34. The same motif from the beginning is still there, but the rhythm has been expanded on from previous rhythms. By the middle of the piece, the vocal lines between each part becomes more rhythmically dense. As of measure 45, the only word sung is flowers. The voices sing ‚Äúflowers‚Äù in two 16th notes with an 8th rest (constantly repeated) or split up the word and sing ‚Äúflau‚Äù/‚Äúwers‚Äù in 8th notes consistently throughout the measures. The voices exchange these rhythms with each other creating an echo. By using 16th notes and 8th notes, the word ‚Äúflower‚Äù is sung much quicker or even spoken. The use of the rhythms not only create an echo effect but also forces the listener to focus on the word. The sporadic nature of this section creates an idea of flowers blooming everywhere instead of just focusing in one place. Measure 70 is when a list of flower names are sung. Notice that each syllable of the flower name is split into repeated quarter notes. This pattern continues until measure 105 when the quarter notes are dotted quarters. By measure 129 there are notes that are elongated through three or more measures. One noticeable elongated flower name is ‚Äúforget-me- nots‚Äù. By measure 129, ‚Äúfor-get-me‚Äù is sung with a half note and then a variation of longer notes such as a quarter notes tied with a dotted quarter and repeated. The purpose is to focus on the idea of ‚Äúdon‚Äôt forget me.‚Äù As a tribute to the miners that have passed in an accident, the composer chose to elongate ‚Äúfor-get-me‚Äù to create a haunting effect and at the end wrap it up with ‚Äúforget-me-not.‚Äù This movement is used to illustrate that these miners and workers should not be forgotten. The piece clearly lays out that the tonic is in A minor. An example occurs in the beginning where the lyrics say ‚Äúflowers.‚Äù In the syllables ‚Äú-weres,‚Äù it is held with a sustaining A, clearly labeling the tonic of piece. In the vocal parts, when one line is in the middle of a phrase another line comes in, and creates a sustaining echo. In each of the vocal parts, it remains diatonic. In the beginning, the range in each of the vocal parts is only an octave from A3 to A4. Each of the vocal parts resolve on the tonic. Although, sometimes the alto‚Äôs resolves on 6th, which gives a minor-third harmony (starting on measure 23). Whenever the lyrics says \\"flowers,\\" the first syllable is either down a 4th or 5th then leaps up to the tonic on the second syllable. Most of the dissonances in the vocal parts are whole step apart. Then in measure 30 the last syllable of ‚Äúflowers‚Äù ends on a G. And then the song changes. In measure 34, rather than the vocalists resolving to the tonic through a 4th or a 5th they resolve in sixteenth tones a whole step apart. In measure 52, everyone sings staccato eighth notes and the dissonances are either are primarily a whole step apart, or a 4th and 5th apart.

The theatre's manager is Tony Deeming. It is run as a charity by Nuneaton Arts Council.The theatre's charity number is 259613. With a regular annual attendance of over 30,000, the Abbey is the only public theatre in Nuneaton, and one of the busiest venues in Warwickshire. History The Nuneaton Arts Council was founded in 1969 by a group of local arts devotees who noted the continuing demise of other venues in Nuneaton. They saw the need to provide a focal point for all aspects of arts, and so when the local Territorial Army drill hall became available, the new Arts Council began the conversion of building to satisfy the needs of the artistic community. The task was completed in 1974, and the very first performance was from the Nuneaton Pantomime and Revue Society, with their production of \\"Finian's Rainbow\\". For several years in the 1980s the theatre also took on the role as the town's only cinema following the closure of the last full time picture house (The Ritz) and continued semi-regular screenings until the new Odeon multi-screen complex opened in the nearby Bermuda Estate. The theatre has had a chequered past, with ups and downs over the past 50 years, including a couple of near closures the most notable being the asbestos situation in 2003. That saw the building closed with no notice after asbestos was identified in many parts of the venue, some of which had been disturbed during recent modification works to upgrade the facilities. The doors were closed for 6 months, but after agreement with the local authority (the building's landlord) a rescue package was agreed and the theatre re-opened in the early autumn and has not looked back since. On 22 January 2007, a performance of the Pied Piper of Hamelin went up half an hour late after contractors had inadvertently concreted emergency doors shut. In 2008, The Masqueraders Theatrical society became another society that had to move from the Civic Hall, Bedworth to the Abbey Theatre, due to the costs of hiring the much larger Bedworth venue. November 2008 saw an entire winter season at the Abbey nearly come to a complete halt because due to the demolition of the old Co-op Hall, situated immediately behind the theatre, which was to become a Lidl supermarket. Access to the backstage areas of the theatre was under threat but last minute talks narrowly avoided all shows in that month being cancelled. August 2012 saw the theatre granted planning permission to install air conditioning in all public areas of the building, improving the customer experience, as previously watching a show at the Abbey was a hot affair. In June 2014, the theatre took part in the UK Heritage Open Weekend and the public were invited to take a look around the theatre. In March 2015, the theatre was the venue for what was thought to be the largest ghost hunters convention in the UK. During March 2015 the venue was also used for a Beats project which was featured on BBC Radio One. One of the biggest challenges to the Abbey, and to all UK theatres, was in 2020 when the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic created a global situation which saw all UK venues close on March 16th. At the time of editing this wiki theatres were still closed, but on July 5th the UK government announced a ¬£1.57 billion rescue package of grants and loans for the arts industry. It was hoped that this injection of funding would ensure the survival of many theatres across the country until such time as they could re-open their doors safely to the public. Facilities The main house The main house seats 250 people with space for 4 wheelchair users with a carer seat by the side of each. The stage is a little over 3 feet high from floor level, the seating is raked (stepped) to the back of the auditorium. Bar The bar can be used for non-theatre events and has in the past hosted smaller events such as comedy nights, small acoustic sessions, and meetings. In the bar area are chairs, sofa's and various screens for showing advertising for forthcoming events. Milby room The Milby room can accommodate up to 60 people. It is used as a rehearsal space for various groups, for local chess club meetings every Monday evening, and by the local neighborhood watch team for local resident meetings. Etone Lounge This is the biggest space outside of the main house and can be used to put on small productions, as this space can seat up to 100 people depending on the layout. This space is mainly used for rehearsals for the local groups as well as for meetings if required. The future In February 2014 it was announced that the NAC was working in conjunction with Nuneaton and Bedworth Borough Council (NBBC) to design and build a brand new community arts complex within the town's ring road, which would provide many more opportunities for a programme with increased quantity, quality and diversity. Although this project has yet to be fully realised, in 2019 the NAC became associated with the Transforming Nuneaton Project (TNP) and the prospect of achieving this long-term goal for the NAC to move to larger premises is now truly in sight.

Born at Morris Hall, near Norham, on 18 September 1849, he came from an old Northumbrian family, being third and youngest son of Thomas Hodgson (b. 1814), who, on the death of a brother in 1869, succeeded to the estates of Stelling and Ovington and assumed the surname of Archer-Hind. The father, a learned horticulturist, graduated B.A. from Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1837 and M.A. in 1840. His wife was his first cousin, Mary Ann, second daughter of John Thomas Huntley, vicar of Kimbolton. Richard Dacre Hodgson was taught Latin and Greek early, by his father, and when he was at Shrewsbury School, where he went in 1862, and was the pupil of Benjamin Hall Kennedy and Henry Whitehead Moss, his father continued to assist his studies. In 1868 he won an open minor scholarship at Trinity College, Cambridge, and in the following October he went into residence at the university, living with his parents, who now moved to Cambridge, as they had formerly moved to Shrewsbury, that he might have the comforts of a home life. He was elected to a college foundation scholarship in 1869 and to a Craven University scholarship in 1871. In 1872 he was placed third in the first class of the classical tripos and won the first chancellor's medal for classical learning. He was elected to a fellowship in his college in October 1873 and was appointed assistant lecturer in April 1877 and assistant tutor in December 1878. At Easter 1899 he was made a senior lecturer, and in December 1903 he retired from the staff. During the last two years of his life Archer-Hind was an invalid. He died at Cambridge on 6 April 1910. The body was cremated at Golder's Green, and the ashes were buried at Cambridge. He married on 17 March 1888 Laura, youngest daughter of Lewis Pocock. He left one son, Laurence, born in 1895. Work Both in Latin and in Greek the exceptional quality of Archer-Hind's scholarship was recognised from the beginning of his Cambridge career. But Greek came to interest him more than Latin. At a later time, while his love of Pindar, √Üschylus, and Sophocles never wavered, his admiration for Plato grew exceedingly. In 1883 he published an admirable edition of the Ph√¶do, in which he investigated the argument of the dialogue, and traced its relations to the rest of Plato's writings. A second edition appeared in 1894. In 1888 he brought out his magnum opus, an original and complete edition of the difficult, important, and neglected Tim√¶us, which gave a new impetus to Platonic studies. The translation is exact and scholarly; the commentary is helpful, learned, many-sided; and in the introduction Archer-Hind sets out the results of his profound study of Plato's metaphysics. His aim is to \\"show that in this dialogue we find, as it were, the focus to which the rays of Plato's thoughts converge, that in fact the Tim√¶us and the Tim√¶us alone enables us to recognise Platonism as a complete and consistent scheme of monistic idealism.\\" Archer-Hind's conception of the theory of ideas as \\"a thorough-going idealism\\" is the key at once to Platonic philosophy and to Platonic science. Papers in the Journal of Philology supplemented the editions of the Ph√¶do and the Tim√¶us. In 1905 Archer-Hind published a volume of Translations into Greek Verse and Prose that Henry Jenner considered to be admirable. An industrious teacher and a singularly efficient examiner, Archer-Hind took no prominent part in the affairs of the university; but his occasional allocutions at university discussions and college meetings were incisive and epigrammatic. He was always an earnest supporter of the movement for the education of women, and gave much time to the affairs of Newnham College and the instruction of its students. His literary interests were by no means limited to the classical tongues. He loved his garden, and kept an exact record of the rare plants which it contained. He took a passionate interest in music; his knowledge of certain favourite composers was intimate and minute, and had made a careful study of Greek music.[Information from Mrs. Archer-Hind, Dr. J. W.

Kennedy, who in 1932 became the resident District Officer at Funafuti for the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony, gave him work blasting reef passages. He was given a job on Ocean Island as a hospital dresser and as the Ellice community liaison person. He ended up leading a strike of Ellice Island workers against the British Phosphate Commission. World War II During the Pacific War Neli Lifuka was on Vaitupu working as a Coastwatcher to identify any Japanese activity. He was later engaged in organising Tuvaluans to work at Funafuti on building the American base and unloading ships. Post- War years After World War II Kennedy encouraged Neli Lifuka in the resettlement proposal that resulted in the purchase of Kioa island in Fiji in 1946. Neli Lifuka organised the collection of the funds to purchase Kioa.Michael Goldsmith, Review of Klaus-Friedrich Koch, Logs in the Current of the Sea, Journal of the Polynesian Society, 87:4 (1978), 361-62 Initially 37 people migrated from Vaitupu to live on Kioa Island; within a decade, more than 235 people followed. In June 1945 Neli Lifuka was appointed the magistrate on Vaitupu. He alienated Colonial administrators for not strictly enforcing laws. He also alienated some of the elders because of his comparative young age to be person in authority in the Vaitupuan community. He resigned in 1951 after being caught in flagrante delicto with the pastor‚Äôs wife. Thereafter he worked for the Colony Cooperative Society and again worked on an inter-island vessel. In 1956, he joined the Kioa community and became the chairman of its council.

To the Workmen of Europe and the United States\\" is a minor political pamphlet written by Karl Marx in May 1869. In it, Marx responds to the violent repression of strikes which had occurred in Belgium the previous month. Background Socialism, as a political ideology, first emerged in Belgium in the second-half of the nineteenth century. Karl Marx had briefly lived in Brussels as an exile between 1845 and 1848 but had made no inroads into the dominance of Belgian politics by Liberal and Catholic parties. The reign of Leopold II () first saw the rise of organised socialist political groups and parties, most notably among the industrial workers in the southern region of Wallonia. Trade unions were legalized in 1866, opening the way to organised labour politics. The International Workingmen's Association held its first conference outside Switzerland in Brussels in 1868 as Belgian socialism, under figures such as C√©sar De Paepe, expanded dramatically. A strike broke out in April 1869 in the industrial towns of Seraing, Li√®ge Province and Frameries, Hainaut Province which was repressed with violence. At least nine strikers were killed by the Garde Civique, a militia, during the ensuing confrontation. A detailed report of the strike was provided to the International by the Belgian socialist Eug√®ne Hins. Text Marx's pamphlet was prepared in French and English versions and presented to the General Council of the International on 4 May 1869 and was officially published as a leaflet in London on 12 May 1869. It was subsequently republished, either integrally or in condensed form, in a number of Belgian and European newspapers. In the text, Marx contrasts the relative acceptance of strikes in the United Kingdom and the United States with the aggressive posture taken in Belgium. He writes: Marx suggests several explanations for the violent repression of the strike. He considers that the Belgian Army provoked the rioting which was used to justify the repression of the strike and accuses conservative political and commercial interests in Belgium of complicity. He also suggests that the violent repression was intended to send a political message to the French Emperor Napoleon III. He draws a comparison with the British repression of the Morant Bay rebellion of 1865 in Jamaica. Ultimately, he attacks the government of Walth√®re Fr√®re-Orban for \\"conspicuously playing the gendarme of capital against labour\\" and threatens that the result will be the weakening of proletarian support for Belgian independence, enabling the possible future annexation of Belgium by the Great Powers. He calls for money to be collected by workers from Europe and the United States to compensate the families of the workers killed.

It was originally raised as the 8th Battalion, Royal Northumberland Fusiliers, formed as a 2nd Line Territorial Army duplicate unit of the 4th Battalion, just before the outbreak of the Second World War as a motorcycle battalion and served as such in the Battle of France in May 1940. It was converted to a reconnaissance unit in April 1941 and fought in North-West Europe from June 1944 until May 1945 when the war in Europe ended. In July 1946, over a year since the end of the war in Europe, the regiment was placed in suspended animation, formally reconstituted on 1 January 1947 and immediately disbanded. History Formation By 1939 it became clear that a new European war was likely to break out and, as a direct result of the German invasion of Czechoslovakia on 15 March, the doubling of the Territorial Army (TA) was authorised, with each unit and formation forming a duplicate. Consequently, the 8th Battalion, Royal Northumberland Fusiliers was formed as a duplicate of the 4th Battalion on 18 June 1939 organized as a motorcycle battalion. Second World War On 2 October 1939, the battalion was assigned to the 23rd (Northumbrian) Division. The division was sent to France on 22 April 1940, on labour and training duties, without any of its artillery or the bulk of its signals and administration units. On 20 May 1940, the division suffered heavy casualties trying to delay the German advance at Arras and had to be evacuated at Dunkirk. On its return to the United Kingdom the 23rd Division was disbanded due to the heavy losses it had suffered and the two infantry brigades were sent to other divisions. After Dunkirk, the battalion left the 23rd Division on 29 June 1940. It was under command of Home Forces until November 1940 when it joined the 3rd Infantry Division, a Regular Army formation, as a motorcycle battalion. The battalion was only of only two Territorial Army units in the division, the other being 76th (Highland) Field Regiment, Royal Artillery. On 30 April 1941 it was transferred to the Reconnaissance Corps and redesignated as 3rd Battalion, Reconnaissance Corps, on 6 June 1942 as 3rd Regiment, Reconnaissance Corps and finally on 1 January 1944 it was transferred to the Royal Armoured Corps as 3rd (Royal Northumberland Fusiliers) Reconnaissance Regiment. It remained part of the 3rd Infantry Division until August 1945. Men of the 3rd Battalion, Reconnaissance Corps 'de-bus' from their Universal Carriers at Sturminster Newton in Dorset, 28 August 1941. The 3rd Infantry Division remained in the United Kingdom, training for many years until it landed on Sword Beach on 6 June 1944D-Dayand fought through the Battle of Normandy (Caen, Bourgu√©bus Ridge, Mont Pin√ßon), the Netherlands (The Nederrijn) and later the invasion of Germany the (Rhineland and the Rhine), ending the war in Bremen. By the end of the war the 3rd Reconnaissance Regiment had lost 90 officers and other ranks killed in action. Post-war The regiment was placed in suspended animation in July 1946. The Territorial Army was disbanded at the end of the Second World War but this was a formality. TA units were reactivated on 1 January 1947, though no personnel were assigned until commanding officers and permanent staff had been appointed in March and April 1947. The 3rd Reconnaissance Regiment was reconstituted on 1 January 1947, converted to infantry with its former title (8th Battalion) and immediately disbanded.

It was completed August 18, 1991 and is dedicated to Cho-Liang Lin.Rouse, Christopher (1991). Violin Concerto: Program Note by the Composer. Retrieved April 27, 2015. Composition A performance of the Violin Concerto lasts approximately 25 minutes. The work is composed in two movements: #Barcarolle #Toccata The two- movement structure of the work alludes to the form of B√©la Bart√≥k's Violin Concerto No. 1. Instrumentation The work is scored for solo violin and an orchestra consisting of two flutes (2nd doubling piccolo), two oboes (2nd doubling cor anglais), two clarinets (2nd doubling bass clarinet), two bassoons (2nd doubling contrabassoon), four horns, two trumpets, three trombones, tuba, timpani, three percussionists, celesta, harp, and strings. Reception Stephen Wigler of The Baltimore Sun praised the piece, saying, \\"It is a beautiful work, accessible yet challenging, and one that is very difficult to play.\\" Wigler continued, \\"Rouse's treatment of the solo instrument puts it ‚Äî as it is not in many other contemporary concertos ‚Äî at the center of things. The work, which runs about 25 minutes, is organized around the violin in ingenious ways. It opens with an extended, yearning violin cadenza; the first movement 'Barcarolle' ends with yet another cadenza in much the same mood ‚Äî this time accompanied by a persistent heartbeat by the timpani and lower strings with some exquisite interjections by the harp and celesta; and the piece ends with yet another cadenza ‚Äî this time in perpetual motion and packed with furious 16th notes and flying double stops.\\" David Gutman of Gramophone similarly lauded the work, writing, \\"Rouse makes his customary allusions, working within a two-part structure that is both satisfying and unusual. The Barcarola's opening tissue of music for string quartet (the soloist plus three orchestral players) is memorably savaged by a tutti chord that subsides into C minor. Its equally haunting conclusion leads immediately to the concluding Toccata, which has the requisite raciness and dazzle of the romantic concerto finale while remaining no more than quasi- tonal.\\" Music critic Tony Haywood also commended the concerto, noting the architecture and a strong interplay between the soloist and orchestra.

Its Greek Revival building was built in 1837, when the school was founded, and was used by that institution until 1860. The building is regionally distinctive as one of a few surviving Greek Revival school buildings with a Greek temple portico. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. Description and history The Norridgewock Female Academy is set in the village of Norridgewock, adjacent to the later Eaton School building on the north side of Mercer Road, just west of its junction with Upper Main Street. It is a 1-1/2 story brick structure with a front-facing gable and a modest Greek temple front with four Tuscan columns and fully enclosed wood frame pediment. The tympanum of the pediment is finished in flushboard, and haas two sash windows at its center. Below the portico, the facade is three bays wide, with a simple entry flanked by sash windows. At the rear of this block a single-story wood frame ell extends to the left, joining it to a wood-frame carriage house. The Norridgewock Female Academy was established in 1837, and the main block of this building was constructed that year on land donated by Dr. Amos Townsend. The school operated until 1860; among its notable graduates was Rebecca Sophia Clarke, who later wrote children's books under the pen name \\"Sophie May\\". The property was then used by the Eaton School (founded 1865) prior to the construction in 1866-67 of its Second Empire edifice next door. This building was then adapted by the Eaton School for use as faculty housing, a role it filled until the 1880s, when it was sold into private hands. The building was purchased by the Norridgewock Historical Society in 1994, which now houses its museum in the building.

Biography The younger son of Colonel George Craven Armstrong, of the East India Company's army, and of Georgianna, daughter of Captain Philip Hughes, he was born at Lucknow, India on 20 July 1836. He was privately educated and was nominated to a military cadetship in the company's service in the year 1855. During the Indian Mutiny he was attached to the 59th Bengal native infantry, and afterwards to Stokes's Pathan horse, a newly raised regiment of native irregulars. As second in command of the latter he was dangerously wounded in the course of the operations around Delhi. On the suppression of the mutiny he was appointed orderly officer at Addiscombe Military College, a post which he occupied till the closing of that institution in 1861, when he retired from the army with the rank of captain. In 1866, Armstrong took up the duties of secretary and registration agent to the Westminster Conservative Association, and his efforts were largely responsible for the electoral defeat of John Stuart Mill by W. H. Smith in November 1868. After acting for a short time as financial manager of Watney's brewery, he was offered in 1871 the editorship and management of The Globe newspaper, then in the hands of a Conservative syndicate led by George Cubitt. The paper was losing money, but Armstrong, without previous experience of journalism, transformed it into a valuable property, and made it an influential supporter of Benjamin Disraeli in the London press. The Globe was made over to him by the owners in 1875, and in 1882 he acquired a major interest in The People, a Sunday conservative paper with a large circulation. Armstrong acquired a handsome fortune, but he took no part in public or political affairs outside the columns of his paper. Perhaps the best remembered incident in connection with his editorship of the Globe was the disclosure in its pages, on 30 May 1878, of the terms of the Salisbury- Schouvaloff Treaty. A summary of that document had been brought to the paper by an occasional contributor, Charles Marvin, to whom the foreign office had given employment as an emergency \\"writer\\". The official denial of its correctness was followed by the publication in the same paper on 14 June of the full text. Proceedings were instituted against Marvin by the government, but were then dropped. In 1892 Armstrong received a baronetcy in recognition of his services to the Unionist party; he had given the editorship of the Globe in 1889, and in 1899 the control of the paper passed to George Elliot Armstrong, his second surviving son, who succeeded to the baronetcy. He died on 20 April 1907, after a long illness, and was buried at Woking. Personal life Armstrong married on 2 February 1865 Alice Fitzroy, daughter of the Rev. Charles Joseph Furlong, who survived him. His eldest son, Arthur Reginald, lieutenant 19th Hussars, died at Secunderabad 1 November 1898. A portrait in oils by Herkomer belongs to his widow.

Arnold was organist successively at St. Columba's College, Rathfarnham, near Dublin (1852), St. Mary's Church, Torquay (1856), and New College, Oxford (1860). Arnold graduated Mus. Bac. at Oxford in 1853 and Mus. Doc. in 1860. In 1865 he succeeded Wesley at Winchester, retaining the post for the rest of his life. He was a fellow of the College of Organists, acting as an examiner for that body. He died at Winchester on 31 January 1902, and was buried there. He married on 6 June 1867 Mary Lucy Roberts, who survived him with three sons and a daughter. An alabaster tablet to his memory, with a quotation from one of his works, was placed in the north transept of the cathedral in 1904. Arnold, whose sympathies were with Bach and his school, was a composer, chiefly of church music. His published compositions include a national song, Old England (1854); an oratorio, Ahab, produced by the National Choral Society at Exeter Hall (1864); Sennacherib, a sacred cantata, produced at the Gloucester Festival of 1883; The Song of the Redeemed, written for and produced at St. James's Church, New York (1891); An orchestral introduction and chorus in praise of King Alfred, performed at the inauguration of the Alfred Memorial at Winchester in 1901, besides two motets, two psalms, anthems, part songs, and two sonatas.

He was a writer for The Manchester Guardian for seventeen years. Biography Arnold was born at Hobart, Tasmania, on 18 September 1852, eldest son and second child of Thomas Arnold; his mother was Julia, daughter of William Sorell, registrar of deeds, Hobart, and his elder sister was the novelist Mrs. Humphry Ward. On the return of his parents to England in 1856 Arnold lived mainly with his father's relations at Fox How, Ambleside. From 1862 to 1865 he was at the Oratory School, Birmingham, where his father was classical master under John Henry Newman. When Thomas Arnold left the Roman Catholic church, his son was sent to Rugby School, where he lived for a year with the headmaster, Frederick Temple, and then in September 1866 entered Charles Arnold's house. He matriculated on 14 October 1871 at University College, Oxford, then under the mastership of George Bradley, and was elected to a scholarship in 1872. He took a second class both in honour moderations (in 1873) and in lit. hum. (in 1875). After graduating B.A. in 1876 Arnold settled at Oxford, combining literary work with private coaching. In 1879 Arnold became a journalist, joining the staff of the Manchester Guardian and settling in Manchester; he wrote (and sub-edited) for the paper for seventeen years. He was a Gladstonian liberal in politics, and a combative participant in the long Irish Home Rule controversy of 1885‚Äì95. He helped to develop the literary section of the Guardian and he encouraged local artists, taking part in the establishment of the Manchester School of Art. His house at Manchester was the centre of a political, literary, and artistic circle. He retired from the Manchester Guardian, due to spinal disease, in 1898, and the next year he moved to London, where he saw friends and wrote a little. Occasionally he travelled south. On his return from a visit to St. Jean-de-Luz he died at Carlyle Square, Chelsea, on 29 May 1904. He was buried at Little Shelford, near Cambridge. A memorial volume by his sister Mary Augusta Ward and Charles Edward Montague, William Thomas Arnold, Journalist and Historian, was published in 1907. Politics A Gladstonian liberal in politics, he fought with courage and consistency through the long home rule controversy of 1885-95. Subsequently, in 'German Ambitions as they affect Britain and the United States' (1903), a collection of letters originally contributed to the 'Spectator' under the signature 'Vigilans et √Üquus', Arnold proved his mastery of foreign contemporary literature and his ability to draw prudent deductions from it. History, literature, and art continued to compete with politics for his interest. Leisure Arnold never ceased to devote his scanty leisure to Roman history. In 1886 he published a critical edition of the section on the Punic war in his grandfather's 'History of Rome' ; and contributions between 1886 and 1895 to the 'English Historical Review ' showed the strength of his interest in ancient history. As years went on Arnold grew fastidious over writing on his chosen subject ; and though to the last he kept up with the latest research, eight chapters of an incomplete history of the early Roman empire, posthumously edited by E. Fiddes under the title of 'Studies in Roman Imperialism' (1906), are all that remain of his accumulated material. They bear witness to his width of knowledge, maturity of thought, and cautious temperament. Works In 1879 he won the Arnold prize with an essay on The Roman System of Provincial Administration to the Accession of Constantine the Great, which was published in 1879. It was digest of the literary and epigraphic sources. A new edition, revised from the author's notes by Evelyn Shirley Shuckburgh appeared posthumously in 1906. In 1886, he published a critical edition of the section on the Punic War in his grandfather Thomas Arnold's History of Rome; and contributions between 1886 and 1895 to the English Historical Review showed his continuing interest in ancient history. Eight chapters of an incomplete history of the early Roman empire were posthumously edited by Edward Fiddes as Studies in Roman Imperialism (1906). Arnold issued a scholarly edition of John Keats (1884; new edit. 1907). He was a contributor to Thomas Humphry Ward's English Poets (1880‚Äì2); and some dramatic reviews by him were published in The Manchester Stage, 1880‚Äì1900 (1900). He revised his father's edition of John Dryden's Essay of Dramatic Poesy in 1903. German Ambitions as they affect Britain and the United States (1903) was a collection of letters originally contributed to The Spectator under the signature \\"Vigilans et √Üquus\\".Memoir of William Thomas Arnold (with portrait) by his sister, Mrs. Humphry Ward, and his colleague of the Manchester Guardian, C.

The plot follows a young, inexperienced, adventure-seeking man named Domenico who is deeply affected by the appearance and stories of a mysterious refugee in his village, and thus decides to take his inheritance and leave the village to go on adventuring. Synopsis This novel is based on the motif of the Gospel parable of the Prodigal Son. Its main hero is Domenico, the younger son of the most powerful villager. He is greatly influenced by the story told by the fugitive, a person gripped by a mysterious fear. Domenic demands of his father his share of the inheritance and leaves to get to know the world. Over the years, Domenico meets many different people and gets caught up in the War of Canudos.  Themes  In this novel, traditional motifs of good, evil, love, morality and the like are illuminated in a new light and unfold as dramatic narrative against a background of an odd merging of humour and aesthetics. There are many memorable characters in the novel. The narrative is easy-going and dynamic, and is accompanied by bold linguistic experiments that create a textual fabric that is utterly peerless and uniquely characteristic of Guram Dochanashvili.book.gov.ge References 1975 novels Georgian-language works Novels by Guram Dochanashvili Georgian novels Allegory Adventure novels Georgian magic realism novels ","title":"The First Garment"},{"id":"46536807","text":"Gerhard Thomsen (23 June 1899 ‚Äì 4 January 1934) was a German mathematician, probably best known for his work in various branches of geometry.

In 1919 he became of the first students at the newly founded University of Hamburg majoring in mathematics and natural science. Aside from a temporary interlude Thomsen studied in Hamburg until 1923. He received a certification to teach at highschools the fall of 1922 and finally his PhD in the summer of the following year. After he worked shortly as an assistant at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology before returning to Hamburg in a similar capacity in the spring of 1925. While working on his habilitation thesis Thomsen spend one year in Rome on Rockefeller grant to study with Levi-Civita. He received his habilitation in Hamburg in 1928 and started a position as a tenured professor at the University of Rostock in the fall of 1929. On 11 November 1933 Thomsen gave an inflammatory talk entitled \\"√úber die Gefahr der Zur√ºckdr√§ngung der exakten Naturwissenschaften an Schulen und Hochschulen\\" (On the danger of marginalizing the exact sciences in schools and universities), that received a large amount of publicity in academic circles. While the talk seemed supportive of some aims of the nazis, it also directly attacked their suppression of education in the sciences. This caused him to be investigated by the Gestapo. Thomsen was killed by a train on a railroad track in Rostock on 4 January 1934. It is assumed that he committed suicide possibly triggered by the Gestapo investigation. Work In Hamburg Thomsen assisted Wilhelm Blaschke to apply Felix Klein's Erlangen Program on differential geometry. He also edited and organized Blaschke's lectures on differential geometry for publication as a series of three books. Thomsen wrote 22 papers on various topics in geometry and furthermore a few papers on theoretical physics as well. The latter were mostly written in Italian rather than in German. Thomsen also wrote a book on the foundations of elementary geometry. In elementary geometry Thomsen's theorem is named after him. Notes James T. Smith: Methods of Geometry.

Lanherne The Arundells of Lanherne ‚Äî \\"the Great Arundells\\" as they were styled ‚Äî appear to have settled in Cornwall, about the middle of the thirteenth century, at the place so called (now the site of a nunnery), situated on the western slope of a wooded valley, lying between St Columb Major and the sea; or possibly before that time at a place in the adjoining parish of St Ervan, named Trembleath (Journal of the Royal Institution of Cornwall, September 1876, pp. 285‚Äì93). The presence of Ardundell's family in England is dated back to ninenteenth century, at the time of William the Conqueror. A very early member of the family, Roger, was marshal of England; and according to the Exeter Cathedral 'Martyrologium,' William de Arundell, who died in 1246, was a canon of that cathedral; about the same time a Roger Arundell lived opposite St. Stephen's church in that city. In 1260 a Sir Ralph Arundell was sheriff of Cornwall; and a few years later we find a John Arundell holding lands at Efford, near Bude, and other Arundells were landowners in the eastern part of the county. Of the Sir John Arundell, the story of whose expedition against the Duke of Brittany in 1379 is recorded by the chroniclers, a separate and fuller account is given below. His grandson, Sir John Arundell, K.B., The Magnificent, was a great church benefactor (notably to the celebrated lost church of St. Piran-in-the-Sands ‚Äî Perranzabul√¶), and, according to his will, dated 18 April 1433, possessed no less than fifty-two complete suits of cloth of gold. He was a naval commander, and was sheriff of Cornwall four times, and M.P. for the county in 1422-3. The Arundells intermarried with most of the old Cornish families ‚Äî nearly all of them now extinct ‚Äî thus adding considerably to their vast possessions, until at length, in the twenty-ninth year of Henry VI, John Arundell, born about 1421, had become the largest free tenant in Cornwall, his estates being of the value of 2,000l. per annum. He was sheriff and admiral of Cornwall, and a general for Henry VI in his French wars, but was attainted in 1483. The Arundells acquired Lanherne by marriage with the heiress of that family; and they also formed, at different periods, alliances with the Carminows, the Grenvilles, the Bevils, the Lambournes, the Carews, the Trevanions, the Erisys, and other Cornish families. Another John Arundell was bishop of Exeter (1502-4); and of him too, as well as of another member of the Lanherne family, who became bishop of Chichester in 1458, fuller accounts will appear below. A grandson of the above-named admiral ‚Äî also a Sir John Arundell ‚Äî was made knight-banneret on the field of Therouenne, died in 1545, and was buried in the church of St Mary Woolnoth, Lombard Street. He was the father of the erudite Mary Arundell. Another Sir John Arundell, who died in 1589 ‚Äî or, according to the Isleworth Register (Oliver's Collections), in 1591 ‚Äî at Isleworth, was converted to Catholicism, as Dodd tells us in his 'Church History,' by Father Cornelius (a native of the neighbouring town of Bodmin). In defence of Cornelius Sir John Arundell lost his own liberty, and was confined for nine years in Ely Palace, Holborn (cf. Morris's Troubles of our Catholic Forefathers, 1875; Simpson's Edmund Campion, 1867; and Challoner's Memoirs of Missionary Priests, 1803). The next prominent members of the Lanherne family are Sir Thomas (d.1552) and Humphry Arundell (1513-1549-50), of both of whom accounts are given below. From Sir John Arundell, the knight- banneret of Therouenne, descended the Arundells of Wardour Castle; and by the marriage of Mary Arundell, in 1739, to Henry, seventh Baron Arundell of Wardour, the Lanherne and Wardour branches of the family were, after a separation of more than two centuries, reunited. Trerice The Arundells of Trerice were seated in the parish of Newlyn East, about five miles south of Lanherne; and some fine portions remain of their mansion of the sixteenth century. At an early period they had another residence at Allerford in West Somerset, but they were seated at Trerice at least as early as the reign of Edward III. At first they bore different arms from the Lanherne Arundells, apparently owing to a difference of opinion as to which was the elder branch; but ultimately they adopted the same, viz. sable, six swallows argent. However this may be, 'precisely to rip up the whole pedigree,' as Richard Carew, the Cornish historian, who married into the Tolverne branch of the family, observes, 'were more tedious than behooveful.' The earliest Trerice Arundell of note seems to have been a Sir John, vice-admiral of Cornwall early in the fifteenth century. When sheriff of Cornwall he was sent by King Edward IV to retake St. Michael's Mount, which had been seized by the Earl of Oxford. Sir John had removed from Efford, by the seaside, to Trerice (an inland abode), owing, it is said, to a prophecy (Hals) that 'he would be slain in the sands.' Yet he did not avert his fate; for, on the strand near Marazion, he lost his life in 1471 in a skirmish; and his remains lie in the chapel of St Michael's Mount. The Arundells of Trerice evidently continued in royal favour, for one of them received an autograph letter from the queen of Henry VII, announcing to him the birth of a prince, her son. Henry VIII appointed another Sir John Arundell (grand-nephew of him who was killed at the Mount) his esquire of the body. He was known as 'Jack of Tilbury.' He is noticed below, as well as his grandson, 'John Game to the Toes' ‚Äî 'John for the King' ‚Äî and his great- grandson, Richard Arundell, first Baron Arundell of Trerice. Carew is full of information as to this branch of the family. The male line of the family became extinct by the death of the fourth baron, John, in 1768; and Trerice ultimately passed into the hands of Sir Thomas Dyke Acland, Bart. An uncle of the last baron, the Hon. Richard Arundell, who died in 1759 without issue, was M.P. for Knaresborough, clerk of the pipe, surveyor of works, master and warden of the mint, and a commissioner of the treasury. Amongst the legal representatives of the Arundells of Trerice in 1829, was Ada Byron, daughter of the poet. Tolverne The Arundells of Tolverne were seated at a very early date at the place on the left bank of the Fal which gives them their distinctive name; but no trace remains of their abode. They seem to have separated from the main stem of Lanherne at an earlier date than the Arundells of Trerice, and to have settled at Tolverne in the reign of Edward I, in consequence of Sir John Arundell of Trembleath (son of Sir Ralph Arundell of Lanherne, who was sheriff of Cornwall in 1260) marrying Joan le Soor of Tolverne. Sir Thomas Arundell, who died in 1443, is another of the early Arundells who appears upon the scene. Like the Arundells of Lanherne and Trerice, the Arundells of Tolverne intermarried with good Cornish blood, but this branch chose generally the western families for their alliances, such as Reskymer, Trefusis, St. Aubyn, Godolphin, and Trelawny. The grandson of Thomas Arundell, who died in 1552 (who was also called Thomas, and who was knighted by James I), having seriously impaired his fortune by endeavouring to discover an imaginary island in America, called 'Old Brazil,' sold Tolverne, and afterwards lived at Truthall in the parish of Sithney. John Arundell, son of Sir Thomas, one of the Truthall Arundells, was a colonel of horse for Charles II, and a deputy governor of Pendennis Castle, in 1665, under his relative Richard, Baron Arundell of Trerice; he died in 1671. Of the Minor Arundells, the branch which settled at Menadarva, in the parish of lllogan, appears to have been founded by one Robert Arundell, a natural son of 'Jack of Tilbury.' Hals has, as usual, some odd gossip about him. One of his descendants, Francis Arundell of Trengwainton near Penzance, was born about the year 1620, and died in 1697. He followed that unusual course amongst the Cornish gentry of taking up arms for the parliament, holding the rank of captain. The Arundells sold Menadarva in 1755 to the Bassets of Tehidy. Another branch settled at Trevithick, about two miles west of St. Columb Major. Various others of the minor Arundells appear from time to time (but fallen from their high estate) in the church registers in the eastern part of Cornwall: one of the line, William, more than two centuries ago, married Dorothy, a descendant of that Theodoro Pal√¶ologus who was buried at Landulph in 1637. She is described in the parish register as being 'ex stirpe imperatorum;' so that there probably still flows in the veins of many a rustic in the neighbourhood of Callington and Saltash the mingled blood of those Arundells who came over to England with the Conqueror, and that of the Byzantine emperors of the East.

Extending from Eden Street to Billings Avenue, it encompasses a well-preserved concentration of summer \\"cottages\\" built during Bar Harbor's heyday as a resort for the wealthy in the early 20th century. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. __TOC__ Description and history \\"Chantier\\", 116 West Street The main village of Bar Harbor is set at the northeastern end of Mount Desert Island on the central coast of Maine. It occupies a nub of land that projects slightly from the surrounding coast, and has coastlines that run east‚Äìwest and north‚Äìsouth. The central business district is located near the center of this nub, focused on the junction of Mt. Desert Street and Main Street. West Street runs parallel to Mt. Desert Street, providing access to the north portion of the coastline. The district extends along West Street from its western junction with Eden Street (where it abuts the Harbor Lane- Eden Street Historic District) to Billings Avenue in the east. Lining the street on both sides are seventeen historically significant summer houses, all built between 1870 and the 1910s, representative of the period when Bar Harbor grew to its height as an exclusive summer resort community. It is home to one of the best concentrations of these summer houses to survive the island's 1947 fire, which destroyed a significant number of such properties. The oldest house in the district, \\"The Kedge\\", is a relatively modest Second Empire house that was built in 1870 and moved to the West Street area in 1886, when the street was formally laid out. \\"Petunia Cottage\\" (1877) was the first building to be built on what became West Street; it is a Queen Anne Victorian that was one of the first houses to be built as a rental property. Following the layout of the road there was a boom in construction, with a significant number of architect-designed properties built lining the waterfront. Stylistically these early houses are all reflective of the Shingle, Queen Anne, or Colonial Revival, which were popular at the time. Three houses were designed by the noted Boston firm Rotch and Tilden, and two were designed by New York architect William A. Potter. In the early 20th century the houses began to increase in scale and elegance. The 41-room\\"Historical society seeks to buy 116-year-old Bar Harbor mansion\\" - Bangor Daily News, September 28, 2018 \\"La Rochelle\\", completed in 1902,\\"Resplendent Refugee\\" - Portland Monthly, November 2017 is a lavish brick mansion in the style of a French chateau, and was one of the area's showpiece houses. It was purchased for around $4.5 million from the Maine Seacoast Mission by the Bar Harbor Historical Society in 2019.\\"LaRochelle purchase is a go\\" - Mount Desert Islander, January 2, 2019 The Mission had named the building The Colket Center, after Campbell's Soup heirs Tristram and Ruth Colket, who donated the building to the organization in 1972, but \\"La Rochelle\\", which is carved into the masonry of the main gates, is the official name. The principal non-residential property, the Bar Harbor Club, is a large Tudor Revival building erected in 1929-30; its early membership included many of society's elites. While some of these summer estates remain in private ownership, a number of them are now owned by Maine Seacoast Mission, a social service agency. In 2017, the town of Bar Harbor revised its list of historic properties, which meant that those property owners will have imposed on them additional requirements should they wish to demolish or renovate said property.

However, by the early 14th century, the primitive monastery was abandoned. The small chapel is remarkable for being partially carved into the cliff and having Romanesque elements.

He was a colleague and great personal friend of Michel Foucault at the College de France; Foucault mentions him in a newly discovered essay review of a book that Ruffe published in 1976 entitled De la biologie √† la culture (From Biology To Culture)Foucault Studies (18) October 2014 pp.128-130Foucault Studies October 2014 Bio‚Äêhistory and Biopolitics 1976 Contributions and Works Ruffi√© studied at St. Stanislaus College of Carcassonne, and obtained medical degrees from medical schools in Toulouse, Montpellier and Paris and Toulouse Sciences Faculty Doctor of Medicine, PhD, Associate Professor of the University Professor of Hematology chair at the Toulouse Faculty of Medicine from 1965 to 1972 Director General of the Regional Blood Transfusion Centre in the region Midi-Pyr√©n√©es . professor of physical anthropology at the Coll√®ge de France in 1972 based in Toulouse on blood typing center of the CNRS, he led in parallel.

He created in 1960 the blood typing, which allows to find an individual by his blood characteristics and is a major contribution to modern Forensic science that later spread and led to DNA testing. This technique also later allowed for the studies of kinship of human populations, as well as the movement of people. He wrote several books on the subject of biologizing thesis, like \\"From biology to culture\\" or \\"Sex and death\\". It went against the established ideas of his time establishing this method of what was considered as tracing two facts in anthropology: According to Ruffi√© the concept of race had a meaning in primitive humanity. Also, the concept Convergence was well established in humans for about six thousand years, probably related to the development of long-distance trading. This long-term influence of Cultural biology had later influenced Stephen Jay Gould , who he mentions in his public works (The Panda's Thumb: More Reflections in Natural History).

Its objectives were to promote British traditions and culture at the expense of others in the state, especially to suppress any social or political influence from German Australian citizens and residents, whether born in Australia or not. Background The Colony of South Australia was settled beginning in 1836 as a free colony. Immigrants were encouraged from Great Britain, and also migrants were encouraged from Europe, in particular German and Wendish Lutherans from Silesia who were seeking to escape religious oppression by Prussia. Over 5400 Germans immigrated in the 1850s. Many of these settled in their own communities including Klemzig, Hahndorf, the Barossa Valley and Lobethal. Over time, these farmers and tradesmen and their families spread across more of the colony (state after 1901). In many of these communities, the Lutheran church had a Lutheran school nearby, quite a few of which taught in the German language. League objectives The league began in Port Adelaide and also established a branch in Adelaide itself. It was supported by several community leaders, including the Governor of South Australia, Sir Henry Galway. The All-British League sought to intern all \\"subjects of enemy origin\\" and remove voting rights, prohibit from parliaments, and remove status as Justice of the Peace. The League referred as \\"alien enemies\\" not only immigrants from Germany, regardless of whether they had sworn allegiance and been naturalised as British Subjects or Australian citizens, but also to their Australian-born descendants. It was explicitly non-partisan in politics, but sought to influence whatever politicians were in power. Supporters The league received support from senior officials. These included *Sir Henry Galway, Governor of South Australia *Sir Samuel Way, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of South Australia * John Verran member for Wallaroo and former premier of South Australia *J. P. Wilson MLC Opposition Not all British Australians supported the objects of the All- British League. One contributor to a newspaper noted that the entire British Royal Family would fail the parentage test to join the All-British League due to intermarrying with other European royalty, and that there were already Australians of German parentage killed or injured fighting for the British side.

On stage, St. Lenox consists of Andrew Choi and a rotating list of musicians from Columbus and New York City, including Chris Hills, Nick Federinko, Jorge Vega, Brandon Vitruls and Jesse Waits. St. Lenox is currently on the Anyway Records label. AllMusic states that the project \\"ha[s] resulted in some of the most unique and unconventionally thrilling pop music in the late 2010s,\\" noting Choi's use of \\"profoundly engaging biographical narratives\\" and American social commentary, observing \\"he has certainly carved out his own distinctive niche and owns it completely.\\" Similarly, Popmatters refers to Choi's penchant for auto-biography and American commentary as Whitmanian, stating that St. Lenox \\"celebrates himself, New York City, the diverse people and occupations of Americans, and the body electric\\" in his work. Biography Early life Prior to St. Lenox, Andrew Choi was a concert violinist, who attended the pre-college program at Juilliard School, where he was a student of Won Bin Yim and Dorothy Delay. Choi was a 1st Prize winner of the American String Teacher's Association National Solo Competition for the violin. Choi was also the concertmaster of the World Youth Symphony Orchestra at the Interlochen Center for the Arts. Choi received an undergraduate degree from Princeton University, a PhD from The Ohio State University and a JD from New York University. Ten Songs About Memory and Hope (2015) St. Lenox's debut album, Ten Songs About Memory and Hope has received critical acclaim, with NPR noting Choi's \\"gigantic voice\\" and observing \\"He belts out his regrets with uncanny melisma, like John Darnielle channeling Tony Clifton.\\" Dusted Magazine observed \\"confessions include Mountain Goatsesque fictions ... detailed memories with slightly sci-fi skews of the present ... But he belts them with an utter lack of guile ... You want to hang out with the guy. You want to hear him talk.\\" College Music Journal called St. Lenox \\"a mournful ... act that features odd but slowly ingratiating melodies and time signatures, not to mention Choi‚Äôs tear-stained, journal-like lyrics that spill out and around the songs. Live, it can be arrestingly intense or just curious, depending on your ability to let love in, as Nick Cave might say. And actually, there‚Äôs a darkness to St. Lenox that probably means he has a few Cave CDs on his shelves.\\" Comparisons with the Mountain Goats include statements from John Darnielle, who called Choi a \\"lyricist of the highest order,\\" remarking that he was \\"feeling really evangelical about just how good a lyricist Andy choi is.\\" Alternatively, Josh Terzino of Music. Defined notes that St. Lenox has \\"a storytelling style reminiscent of a young Billy Joel.\\" In 2015, Ten Songs About Memory and Hope was placed on a number of local and regional End-of-Year lists. Of note, the Editor-in-Chief of Noisey (VICE's music division) named the song \\"Bitter Pill\\" one of the ten best songs of the year, noting \\"this might be one of the saddest songs I‚Äôve ever heard.\\" Ten Hymns from My American Gothic (2016-2017) In October 2016, St. Lenox released his sophomore album, \\"Ten Hymns From My American Gothic,\\" written as a gift to his father, who immigrated from South Korea, in honor of his 70th birthday. Commenting on the album in Angry Asian Man, Choi noted that the album focused on first and second-generation American narratives, and was written as a form of modern American social realism. Given the timing of the release, some writers interpreted the album as a commentary on the 2016 Presidential Election. The album was critically well-received, with PopMatters calling the record \\"nothing short of a 21st century pop masterpiece,\\" and praising St. Lenox as a \\"singular voice\\" in a period marked by \\"the ever increasing white noise overwhelming the internet in the wake of the great democratization of recording.\\" The review, noting the immigration themes throughout, compared the song \\"People From Other Cultures\\" to the \\"Parents\\" episode of Master of None. AllMusic similarly praised the album as an example of \\"true 21st century songwriting\\" observing that St. Lenox‚Äôs \\"gutsy indie pop chronicles the modern American experience in a dazzling litany of soulful free verse.\\" The Harvard Crimson, comparing Choi‚Äôs voice to Chris Stapleton and Van Morrison proclaimed it a \\"stellar album, covering the experience of the children of immigrants from the emotional highs of boundless optimism to cultural disconnect ‚Ä¶ one of the most interesting releases of the year.\\" Premiering the video for the song \\"Thurgood Marshall\\", Stereogum described Choi‚Äôs voice as \\"one of the most striking instruments in music today.\\" The song \\"Thurgood Marshall\\" was additionally featured as a Best Songs of the Week at Consequence of Sound and Vulture, and referenced as part of the popular culture history of the late Supreme Court justice in Time Magazine. \\"Ten Hymns\\" appeared on a number of national and regional End-Of-Year lists, in particular making the Best Albums of 2016 list at PopMatters, as well as being one of the highest rated albums of 2016 on Metacritic, receiving a Metascore of 85. The record was also the highest rated indie pop record from PopMatters for the year 2016, as well as the highest rated indie pop record of 2016 according to album review aggregator Album Of The Year. Ten Fables of Young Ambition and Passionate Love (2018) In May 2018, St. Lenox debuted material from his third album, \\"Ten Fables of Young Ambition and Passionate Love\\" on podcast Improv4Humans, performing a live version of the opening track, \\"Hashtag Brooklyn Karaoke Party\\" with comedians Paul F. Tompkins, Janet Varney, Seth Morris and Matt Besser. St. Lenox subsequently released the album in September 2018. Stereogum premiered the record, hailing St. Lenox as \\"a truly unique and captivating American songwriter,\\" and exclaiming that \\"no one sings like Andrew Choi.\\" PopMatters praised the record's literary qualities, describing St. Lenox as \\"a lyrical genius\\" with comparisons to Walt Whitman, noting \\"Choi's a Whitmanian who ... celebrates himself, New York City, the diverse people and occupations of Americans, and the body electric ... full of wry observations about the people and places he encounters and his search for love that capture the old courage teacher's modern sensibility.\\" AllMusic similarly highlighted the record's distinctly American observational commentary, noting that St. Lenox \\"manages to remain relatable and grounded, spinning with great fervor tales that while unique to his path could also belong to thousands of other Americans trying to navigate their way across the confusing social landscapes of their own cities and communities ... Choi's extravagant presentation and lingering Midwestern humility somehow cancel each other out and into the creative enigma that is St. Lenox.\\" As with \\"Ten Hymns\\", \\"Ten Fables\\" appeared on a number of national and regional End-Of-Year lists, in particular being ranked #43 on PopMatters Best Albums of 2018 List, as well making the AllMusic list of Best Indie Pop and Indie Rock Albums of 2018. Influences St. Lenox's voice has drawn a variety of comparisons, with Cincinnati CityBeat pointing to similarities with Cee-Lo Green, Ryan Adams and Adam Levine. El Correo compares St. Lenox's voice to that of Cee-Lo Green and Stevie Wonder. Willfully Obscure notes \\"I'd more accurately slot his soaring, penetratingly melodic timbre somewhere between Stevie Wonder and Adam Levine. But upon deeper investigation ... something all the more indigenous and captivating, a la Jeff Buckley or Rufus Wainwright.\\" Notably, Stereogum has referenced St. Lenox's voice in an increasingly wide variety of contexts, comparing his voice to that of John Darnielle, Michael Stipe, Jamie Stewart, Craig Finn, Cee-Lo Green and Wesley Willis. Other Appearances St. Lenox appeared on a limited-run streaming series, organized by staff at MTV called \\"Streamed Dumplings\\". He also made a brief musical appearance on the TLC show Extreme Cheapskates, serenading a couple on their first date.

He had two Junior Lightweight Title shots against Tod Morgan in 1926‚Äì27, but was unable to take the championship. Moving up in weight class, he also excelled as a Lightweight. His long career spanned twenty-three years and included over two hundred verified bouts.  Early boxing career  Joe Glick was born in the Williamsburg area of Brooklyn, on February 22, 1903 and began training as a boxer in his teens. He worked as a tailor prior to his boxing career. Barely eighteen in 1921, he won nine of his first eleven fights in the Brooklyn area, showing exceptional promise at an early age. Six of his first eleven wins were won by knockout. He lost only two of his better publicized fights in 1922, setting an exceptional early fight record. On January 26, 1923, he was knocked out by Petey Hayes at the 9th Coast Defense Armory in New York, but did not incur another loss until June 9, 1923 against Jimmy Hutchinson. He had only two additional losses in 1923, as the quality of his competition continued to steadily improve.  Boxing career as jr. lightweight contender and top lightweight  At 23, in a ten-round bout on January 29, 1926, Glick defeated Johnny Dundee, the former 1923 Featherweight and Junior Lightweight champion who was nearing the end of an exceptional career. According to the Milwaukee Sentinel, the rising Glick was a 2‚Äì1 favorite against Dundee, who, despite his reputation, had been retired from the ring for six months prior to his bout with Glick.\\"Glick is 2 to 1 Favorite to Beat Johnny Dundee\\", The Milwaukee Sentinel, Bend, Oregon, 29 December 1926, pg. 10 Partly as a result of this win, Glick was matched with Tod Morgan, Junior Lightweight Champion on September 30 of that year and was decisively defeated in his first fifteen- round title shot in Madison Square Garden. According to the Associated Press, Glick took only one round of the fifteen-round match. Close match with Jr. Lightweight Champion Tod Morgan In a second World Junior Lightweight Title on December 16, 1927, Glick fared better against Morgan in a controversial match. Glick lost the bout as a result of punching Morgan below the belt in the fourteenth round. At least one source, Oregon's Bend Bulletin wrote that for each of the three times Morgan was down on the canvas, \\"it was from a questionable body blow which was struck near the foul line.\\" The Bulletin also noted that the \\"9000 fans started yelling low blow as early as the second round\\". Glick dropped Morgan for nine counts once in the second and twice in the fifth, and may have won the bout had he not been disqualified for a low left to the groin in the fourteenth by referee Eddie Forbes. Morgan was hurt by loops to the head, often to the jaw, and digs to the body at several points in the bout. Glick began the first with a strong and effective attack against Morgan. Glick was first warned of a low blow in the third round, and had lost previous fights to low blows.\\"Boro Fighters Tendency to Hit Low Cost Title; Tod's Gameness Counts\\", Brooklyn Daily Eagle, Brooklyn, New York, pg. 8, 17 December 1927Glick had lost other fights from low blows in \\"Glick Claims He Did not Foul Morgan\\", The Evening News, Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, pg. 8, 17 December 1927 Though he was ahead on points prior to the foul, Glick subsequently lost his second chance at the Junior Lightweight title. He would never get a third opportunity.\\"Joe Glick Loses Chance at Junior Lightweight Crown on Foul\\", The Bend Bulletin, Bend, Oregon, 17 December 1927, pg. 2 In between these two bouts with Morgan between January 1926 and December 1927, Glick stayed busy fighting exceptional boxers including Benny Bass and Jack Bernstein. Future Boxing Hall of Fame recipient Bass would at one time hold both the World Jr. Lightweight and Featherweight Title. Bernstein had briefly taken the World Jr. Lightweight Title on May 30, 1923 at the Coney Island Velodrome against Johnny Dundee. Glick was unable to beat Bass in his three meetings, but did obtain one no decision. Shortly before his second bout with Morgan, he defeated Bernstein in a widely attended ten-round match on November 14, 1927 at Madison Square Garden. Brief boxing suspension and bout with Baby Joe Gans Oddly, Glick was suspended for a full year from boxing by the Philadelphia Boxing Commission for stalling during his bout with Al Gordon in Philadelphia on February 13, 1928. The suspension applied only to Philadelphia, and Glick fought extensively in New York and New Jersey the remainder of the year, meeting elite lightweights.\\"Joe Glick Suspended\\", The Pittsburgh Press, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, 15 February 1928, pg. 22 On November 16, 1928, in one of his most well attended bouts, Glick met Baby Joe Gans in Madison Square Garden in New York before a crowd of nearly 19,000. The United Press expressed distaste in the quality of the match, though the local New York Times was quite impressed with the quality of Glick's fighting, and the crowd ardently supported the ten round points decision in favor of Glick, the New York native. After the zenith of his early career as a Junior Lightweight in January 1929, Tex Ricard, manager for Jack Dempsey, still rated Glick third among top Lightweights in America.Ricard, Tex \\"How Ricard Ranked Them\\", The Pittsburgh Press, Pittsburgh, PA, 8 January 1929, pg. 36 Exciting bouts with Champions Jimmy McLarnin, Kid Kaplan, Jack \\"Kid\\" Berg, and Tony Canzoneri In January and March 1929, Glick faced the exceptional Jimmy McLarnin, a former Lightweight champion, but lost to him in both bouts. Glick's first bout with McLarnin in Madison Square Garden on January 11, garnered large attendance, and though Glick lost the ten round bout by unanimous decision, McLarnin's nose was broken in the bout. His second bout with McLarnin in the Garden on March 1, attended by nearly 19,000, ended when Glick was knocked out in the second round. Glick also lost to Louis \\"Kid Kaplan,\\" former Featherweight champion, in April 1929. In 1930, Glick fought Tony Canzoneri, former World Featherweight champion, and hall of famer Jackie \\"Kid\\" Berg, Featherweight World Champion from 1930‚Äì31. Canzoneri beat Glick in a ten-round decision, taking the lightweight title later that year. Berg would defeat Glick in two decisions that year.Blady, Ken (1988). The Jewish Boxer's Hall of Fame, Shapolsky Publishers, New York, New York, p. 277. By 1933, Glick's career began to wane, and though he continued to box talented boxers, he lost a number of his bouts, with some by knockout. In 1933‚Äì35, he lost twelve well publicized bouts. On September 1, 1934, he was knocked out by Ceferino Garcia, a 1939 World Middleweight champion in only the second round of a ten-round match in Pismo Beach, California. On October 26, 1934, he was knocked out in less than a minute by Freddie Steele in Yakima, Washington. During this period, Glick had begun to appear as a movie extra in the Los Angeles area.  Movie career after professional boxing  Near the end of his professional boxing career around 1933, Glick moved to Los Angeles and appeared in a number of films, primarily as an extra, often appearing in the movie's credits. In 1933, Glick appeared briefly on screen in 20th Century Pictures' The Bowery. In this rough slice-of-life movie set in the New York Bowery in the East end of Manhattan in the 1890s, several of the characters played thugs or boxers. The film starred actors Wallace Beery and Fay Ray, and Glick appeared with ex-Middleweight World Champion Al McCoy, as well as boxers Jim Flynn, Phil Bloom, Frank Moran, British boxer William Thomas, known as \\"Kid Broad,\\" Jack Herrick and Abe Hollandersky. The boxing extras were well cast. Bloom, Flynn, Moran, and Hollandersky had all boxed frequently in New York, and several had lived there.Hollandersky, Abe (1958) The Life Story of Abe the Newsboy, Hero of a Thousand Fights, Published by Abraham Hollandersky, Los Angeles, pg. 310. Glick also appeared briefly in the 1933 Paramount Productions's, Tillie and Gus, an adventure film about the purchase of a ferry boat, the Fairy Queen. Another rough slice-of-life movie in which Glick appeared was the black and white 1934 Paramount Productions's film, LimeHouse Blues. Not atypical of the movies in which ex-boxers found roles, the film depicted rough street life. It was set in London's LimeHouse Causeway, a riverfront slum, and the main character, Harry Young ran a smuggling business out of his club. In 1938, Glick played an extra in MGM's The Crowd Roars. In this successful boxing movie with Robert Taylor as the lead, Glick briefly appeared in a background gymnasium scene with boxers Larry Williams, Maxie Rosenbloom, Jimmy McLarnin, Abie Bain, Frankie Grandetta, Jack Roper, Tommy Herman, Larry Williams, and Abe \\"The Newsboy\\" Hollandersky.\\"Pretty Boy to HeMan\\", Dallas Morning News, pg. 12, Dallas, TX., 9 August 1938. Glick also played a small role in Imperial Pictures', May 1957 release of Monkey on My Back, which often included the subtitle The Barney Ross Story. Loosely based on the life of Lightweight, Junior Welterweight, and Welterweight boxing Champion Barney Ross, the film cast Ross as the character Cameron Mitchell in a major role. His real life cornerman Art Winch was played by Richard Benedict. Boxers appearing in the movie included Ceferina Garcia, who both Ross and Glick had boxed with painful results, Joe La Barba, and Tommy Herman. Though the only film ever made about the triple world title holder and recipient of the Silver star, it was a disappointment to Ross and his family who felt it sensationalized Ross's drug addiction.Century, Douglas (2006) Barney Ross, The Life of a Jewish Fighter, Schocken Books, Random House, New York, pg. 146. Glick died on September 5, 1978 in Woodland Hills, a suburb of Los Angeles, California.

Background Before the election the Conservatives controlled the council with 33 councillors, while the Liberal Democrats had 10 seats, Labour had 3, there was 1 independent and 2 seats were vacant. Boundary changes since 1999 reduced the number of wards from 36 to 32 and the number of councillors fell by four. Although all of the seats on the council were up for election, in Norton and Whittington, and Pinvin, there was no election as there was only one candidate in each ward. One-third of the Conservative councillors stood down at the election, as well as independent John Smith who had represented Pershore on Wychavon District Council from its first election in 1973. Election result The Conservatives remained in control of the council after winning 31 of the 45 seats on the council. The Liberal Democrats remained the largest opposition with 12 seats, while Labour took two seats. Overall turnout at the election was 37.94%, almost 4% higher than at the 1999 election. Among the defeated candidates was the Labour leader on Worcestershire County Council, Peter Pinfield, who lost in Droitwich East. Meanwhile, the Conservative leader of the council, Malcolm Meikle, held his seat by 39 votes and the Liberal Democrat group leader, Margaret Rowley was elected by 19 votes after recounts in both wards.

Her father was a bomb sawyer. Harvesting bombs after the war was a means of survival in her village. Bombs were sawed to extract the TNT inside, which was used to catch fish. The outer shells were sold to recyclers as scrap metal. Her father was injured by a bomb on a nearby hill. He needed a corneal graft and it took him 6 months to recover. The bomb accident tore her family apart, causing numerous events later. \\"It was not a big deal though\\", Linh said. \\"The big deal is that every year, around 4,000 people in Vietnam are severely injured and die due to accidents with explosives. The danger is not a deterrent for bomb sawyers, who regard it as their only source of income.

When Linh went to Aruchour village ‚Äì a remote area in Nepal to do volunteer work - she found out people over there speak English very well although they are very poor. Linh spent a whole day in the library of a primary school reading a Nepalese English textbook. Then, she made a comparison with the English textbooks in Vietnam and realized there was something wrong in the English textbooks for Vietnamese students. She then wrote a letter to the Minister of Education. After publishing it on Facebook, the letter received more than 24.000 \\"Like\\" clicks and more than 10.000 \\"Share\\" clicks and later went viral. Linh said, \\"I still don't know why people appreciated me after that. I suppose that anybody can write a letter like me, to say anything they want to say. That was not bravery.

VHV's goal is to set up at least one free English class in each province of Vietnam by 2020 for children, especially for disadvantaged ones from 9‚Äì12 years old, to be taught by our volunteers and travelers. In explaining the reason why she chooses English as the focus of her project, Linh recalled her time in Nepal, saying people there were in deep poverty, living without the Internet, TV or phones but spoke English very well. \\"As a person who is not very good at English, I see those who are good at the language having the chance to land well-paid jobs in Vietnam,\\" she added. \\"I don't want language to be a barrier for Vietnamese people.\\" \\"Our target is not how many VHV students we teach but raising people's awareness of how important English is,\\" Linh stated. \\"When people understand the language's importance, they will learn it voluntarily.\\"Nepal blizzard survivor offers travelers home in return for language lessons Volunteer House Vietnam has so far obtained significant results: Over 2000 volunteers from over the country have registered to be its members; 80 free accommodations from 20 provinces of Vietnam have been offered to Volunteer House Vietnam, 4 English classes in Ho Chi Minh City and 4 English classes in Hanoi were established. With the growth of volunteers and the support from the community, Linh believes that Vietnamese children can confidently communicate in English - which is the key for them to open the door to the world in the near future.Travellers take their time to give something back Writer Linh started writing at an early age and became a journalist, a novelist and co-author of 10 books for teenagers. Linh said, her first writing was a divorce agreement for her mother, which, in her thought, was the only way to help protect her mother from being beaten by her father. Domestic violence is common in the countryside of Vietnam but many women - including her mother - are reluctant to divorce their husbands, as they are afraid of people judging them and assume that domestic violence is normal. After being co-author of ten books of short stories for teenagers, Linh has recently published her first novel \\"Over the Hill\\" (Vietnamese: B√™n kia ƒë·ªìi) This novel received good reviews from critics.B√™n Kia ƒê·ªìi (Over The Hill) - Vo My Linh This novel talks about a character named Nu. Nu is a special kid who always had a different perspective from the majority. Nu's house is nearby a hill. She wanted to climb on the hill to see something but many old folks in her village told her not to because a lot of souls of soldiers who died in the American war were there. Nu was scared but she still kept the thought in her mind that she would go there one day. When Nu grew up, she saw most of the people around her had a humdrum life. They accepted what they had and did not want to change. NU lost faith in people. Then she decided to quit her job to travel. She hoped she could find some good things in India. Nu met many types of people on the way. She became a good friend with a monk. The monk attempt to rape her later. Nu run away from him. The journey took Nu back to Vietnam, to the village where Nu grew up. This time, she decided to climb to the top of the hill. She looked over the hillside but didn't see anything, not even a ghost, nor a beautiful flower there. However, when she looked back, she found out her village was very beautiful from that view. That was also the time Nu realized that she has grown up and been more mature. The village did not change after many years. If Nu were a kid again, she would have found it ugly. When people are mature, they try to comply and accept things easier. Comments About the letter for the minister The Former Deputy Prime Minister in Vietnam, Mr. Vu Khoan, shared: \\"I really had a strong impression about Linh. When her letter became famous on the social network, somebody blamed the Minister of Education due to that. However, when she gave an interview, Linh said, \\"I don't want to blame the Minister because my English was not good. I blame myself first because I didn't try everything to learn it.

M., et al. \\"Halostagnicola larsenii gen. nov., sp. nov., an extremely halophilic archaeon from a saline lake in Inner Mongolia, China.\\" International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology 56.7 (2006): 1519-1524. PUB MED doi: 10.1099/ijs.0.64286-0 It is a halophilic, neutrophilic, chemo-organotroph and was isolated from samples taken from a saline lake in China. The etymology of the name comes from hals, halos Greek for salt, stagnum Latin for a piece of standing water, -cola Latin for inhabitant or dweller, and Larsenii named after the Norwegian microbiologist, Helge Larsen, who was a pioneer in research regarding halophiles. Discovery In September 2003, researchers from the University of Seville, Spain, obtained samples of sediment from a lake in Inner Mongolia, China. Lake Xilinholt is an extremely saline lake, thus providing the optimum growth conditions for Halostagnicola larsenii . The samples were cultivated in a 20% saline solution.Nutrient agar plates were used to cultivate the samples. The media contained sodium chloride and was optimized at a pH of 7.5. H. larsenii grows optimally at 15% NaCl, 37 ¬∞ Celsius and pH 7-8. It is unable to grow at temperatures above 50 ¬∞ Celsius. Further characterization of the species was conducted and it was proposed by Castillo et al., that strain XH-48 be identified as a new species within the Halostagnicola phylum. Characterization Morphology Morphology was determined using phase contrast optics by an Olympus BX41 microscope. Cells of Halostagnicola larsenii XH48 are 0.5-1.0 micrometers wide and 1.0-3.0 micrometers long. Cells of H. larsenii are pleomorphic, and display rod, square or disc shaped cells. This reflects the strain's ability to change size and shape in response to changes in the environment, such as salinity. The colony morphology of H. larsenii is circular, smooth, opaque and pink in color. Polar ether lipids found in its membrane include phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylglyceromethylphosphate. These lipids were extracted with chloroform and methanol. Tests revealed this organism is oxidase positive and catalase negative. Metabolism Halostagnicola larsenii is a halophilic, neutrophilic, chemo-organotroph and uses oxygen as its terminal electron acceptor. H. larsenii can utilize a variety of carbohydrates such as fructose, glycerol, lactose, glucose, arabinose, acetate, ribose, starch, maltose, galactose, ribose, xylose, glutamate, and propionate as substrates for growth. Growth substrates were determined through the use of the isolation medium, which contained the substrate being tested along with yeast extract. Additionally, H. larsenii undergoes assimilatory nitrate reduction to nitrite to ammonia.\\"Nitrogen Metabolism: H. Larsenii.\\" Nitrogen Metabolism: H. Larsenii. KEGG, n.d. Web. 23 Apr. 2015. This process differs from nitrate reduction because it occurs aerobically and uses ferrodoxin as an electron donor.Guerrero, M. G. \\"Assimilatory nitrate reduction.\\" (1985): 170-171. Antibiotic Resistance H. larsenii is resistant to the following antibiotics: ampicillin, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, gentamicin, nalidixic acid, neomycin, penicillin G, rifampicin, streptomycin, and tetracycline. The organism is sensitive to bacitracin and novobiocin. Antibiotic sensitivity and resistance was determined using the agar diffusion test in which paper discs saturated with antibiotics were placed on agar plates. Ecology Halostagnicola larsenii was originally discovered in a saline lake in Inner Mongolia, China. It has also been isolated from rock pit sea water in the West Coast of Maharashtra, India.Kanekar et al. ‚ÄúExploration of a haloarchaeon, Halostagnicola larsenii isolated from rock pit sea water, West Coast of Maharashtra, India, for production of Bacteriorhodopsin (BR).\\" Journal of Applied Microbiology. (2014) PUBMEDdoi: 10.1111/jam.12784 Typically, haloarchaea such as H. larsenii require high salinity environments for growth and can be found in the sediment of aquatic environments such as freshwater lakes.Luque, R., et al. \\"Diversity of culturable halophilic archaea isolated from Rambla Salada, Murcia (Spain).\\" Extremophiles 16.2 (2012): 205-213. Genomics In 2014, the complete genome of H. larsenii was sequenced using Illumina dye sequencing HiSeq 2000 by Iain Anderson as part of the Archaeal Tree of Life Project supported by the Joint Genome Institute. The genome consists of 2.79 Mega-bases \\"Halostagnicola Larsenii XH-48, Complete Genome.\\" National Center for Biotechnology Information. U.S. National Library of Medicine, n.d.

The 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequence of H. larsenii was studied using ARB software.
