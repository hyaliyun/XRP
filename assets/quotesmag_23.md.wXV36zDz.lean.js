Early life Edye Rolleston Manning was born in Australia on 14 February 1889, the son of William Alexander Manning, a solicitor practising in Sydney, Australia. He was educated at Bedford Modern School in England before going on to study medicine at the University of Edinburgh. Military career When the First World War broke out, Manning ceased his studies at Edinburgh and joined the cavalry, serving in France and Belgium with the 15th Hussars. Frustrated by the stalemate of trench warfare he transferred to the Royal Flying Corps where he attained RAeC Certificate No. 2253 on 9 October 1916. He was wounded at the Battle of the Somme in July 1916 while serving with No. 3 Squadron. As Commanding Officer of No. 6 Squadron, Manning was responsible for the evacuation of the British High Commissioner from Suliemanieh in Kurdistan, after which he was made a Companion of the Distinguished Service Order. In 1928 he chose to go on half-pay in order to attempt a flight from England to Australia in a Westland Widgeon he owned privately. He got as far as Tunis before crashing at Lebda; Manning was uninjured but his plane was a write-off and he was forced to abandon the attempt. After his aborted flight, Manning became Officer Commanding of RAF Hornchurch (1930) and RAF Manston (1933) before retiring in 1935 to become a stockbroker in Sydney. At the advent of the Second World War he was persuaded to return to the Royal Air Force, becoming Officer Commanding No. 221 Group (RAF) as a group captain in March 1941, establishing a \\"string of airfields stretching from Lashio to Mingladon\\". In January 1942 he was appointed Air Commodore of the Group. Manning died on 26 April 1957. There is a photographic portrait of Manning at the National Portrait Gallery, London.

Al-Anbari was killed by a US military airstrike on 13 November 2015. History Abu Nabil al-Anbari was an Iraqi policeman who, following the 2003 invasion of Iraq, joined al-Qaida in Iraq and took part in the Iraqi insurgency. Arrested by American forces in 2008, Abu Nabil spent time in detention in Abu Ghraib prison before being released after a year and a half, upon which he returned to militancy. However, not long after he was released, he was captured and imprisoned again, being detained in Abu Ghraib prison until he was freed in a mass prison break in 2013. He would later serve as ISIL's \\"governor\\" of Salahuddin Governorate, responsible for the group's operations there, including the attack on the city of Samarra. As the governor of Salahuddin Governorate, he was responsible for overseeing the execution of up to 1,700 Shia Iraqi Air Force cadets in the Camp Speicher massacre. In 2014, ISIL's leadership dispatched him from Iraq to Libya as part of a delegation to gather pledges of allegiance to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi from local militants and lead the nascent ISIL branch in the country. Death Al-Anbari was killed in a US airstrike outside of Derna, Libya on 13 November 2015. The Libya Herald reported local claims that al-Anbari had not been killed in the airstrike, however a eulogy to Abu Nabil al-Anbari was published online by a member of ISIL some weeks later. In a statement following the strike, Pentagon press secretary Peter Cook said \\"Abu Nabil's death will degrade [ISIL's] ability to meet the group's objectives in Libya, including recruiting new members, establishing bases in Libya, and planning external attacks on the United States.\\" He added: \\"Reporting suggests [he] may also have been the spokesman in the February 2015 Coptic Christian execution video,\\" referring to a video which showed the beheading of 21 Egyptian Copts in Libya after their kidnapping in 2015. His killing was the first military action by the United States against an ISIL target outside of Iraq and Syria while still connected to the organization's core leadership (other militants struck in countries like Nigeria and Afghanistan are not believed by US officials to be directly linked to the Iraq and Syria based leadership). In January 2016, ISIL confirmed al-Anbari's death and launched a series of attacks and bombings across Libya named \\"the battle of Abu al-Mughira al-Qahtani\\" in his honour.https://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2016/01/islamic-state-libyan- province-goes-on-offensive-in-libya.php Al-Anbari was succeeded as leader of ISIL in Libya by Abdul Qader al-Najdi.

The water is muddied still further by Butt's bare statement that Flow Moss Cottage was simply renamed \\"Astley\\" implying no change of location.

AGST's purpose is to enable its member seminaries to offer advanced degrees, especially doctorates, to prepare scholars and leaders for the Church and society in Asia. AGST was self-consciously modelled on the South East Asia Graduate School of Theology, which is operated by the Association for Theological Education in South East Asia. Bong Rin Ro notes that AGST was formed to stop the \\"brain drain\\" of Asian Christian workers to the West: \\"The Asian Church had depended on western seminaries and churches too long, and the time had come for us to be independent from the West in theological education; otherwise, we would not be able to grow ourselves.\\" He goes on to note that one of AGST's objectives was to \\"encourage cultural adaptation of theological education.

It was headlined by American pop group Maroon 5, joined by rappers Big Boi and Travis Scott as guests. Several musicians reportedly turned down offers to perform the show due to their support for Colin Kaepernick‚Äîwho has accused the NFL and its franchises of colluding against him due to his national anthem protests against police brutality. As such, Maroon 5, Big Boi, and Scott, along with national anthem singer Gladys Knight, were criticized by fans and critics for accepting the invitation. In response to the controversy, Scott only agreed to participate if the NFL made a donation to a charity supporting social justice, and Maroon 5 later announced a similar donation to Big Brothers Big Sisters of America. In response to an online petition, a brief clip featuring the cast of SpongeBob SquarePants (referencing an episode that, itself, centered around a halftime show) was shown as a tribute to the show's creator, Stephen Hillenburg, who had died in November 2018. Many fans of the show online criticized the performance as the petition intended for the entirety of Sweet Victory to be played, instead of the short clip leading into Sicko Mode.https://www.cbsnews.com/news/spongebob-squarepants-fans-have-mixed- reactions-to-super-bowl-halftime-show-appearance-2019-02-03-atlanta/ The show itself received largely negative reviews and had the lowest ratings in 10 years. Critics considered it to be boring and underwhelming, and argued that the choice of Maroon 5 was intended to be \\"safe\\" and uncontroversial in the wake of the Kaepernick controversy. Background Maroon 5 performing in 2011 As early as September 2018, multiple sources had reported that Maroon 5 were to headline the Super Bowl LIII halftime show, but the NFL had not yet made an official announcement. In October 2018, it was reported that Pink and Rihanna had each declined an offer to headline, the former because the negotiation process was too lengthy for her taste and the latter due to her support of Colin Kaepernick. In December, Billboard reported that Houston-based rapper Travis Scott was expected to make a guest appearance. On January 13, 2019, the NFL officially announced that Maroon 5 would headline the show, joined by Scott and Big Boi, an Atlanta native and member of the hip-hop duo Outkast. In an interview, Maroon 5 lead singer Adam Levine explained that the band wanted to bring the halftime show \\"back to a time when it was a little more simple, when the focus was the connection to the songs.\\" After the death of Stephen Hillenburg, creator of the Nickelodeon cartoon SpongeBob SquarePants, on November 26, 2018, an online petition emerged requesting that David Glen Eisley's song \\"Sweet Victory\\"‚Äîfeatured in the episode \\"Band Geeks\\", which followed Squidward Tentacles as he organized an ensemble to perform the halftime show at the \\"Bubble Bowl\\"‚Äîbe performed at the show. By December 24, 2018, the petition on Change.org had over one million signatures, and the Twitter account of Mercedes-Benz Stadium also acknowledged the campaign. During the halftime show, a short animation featuring Squidward, Mr. Krabs, Mrs. Puff, SpongeBob, and Patrick, as well as footage of the Bikini Bottom band from the episode, was used to introduce Scott for his performance of \\"Sicko Mode\\". According to animator Nico Colaleo, the animation was completed in a few days. Controversy Several acts reportedly turned down invitations to perform the halftime show due to their support of Colin Kaepernick's protests against police brutality. Maroon 5, Scott, and Big Boi faced criticism for their decision to perform at the halftime show, due to the alleged blacklisting of Colin Kaepernick by the NFL and its franchises for protesting police brutality by kneeling during the national anthem before games. Several artists‚Äîincluding Jay-Z, Cardi B, and Rihanna‚Äîreportedly turned down offers to headline the show as a display of solidarity. A petition was organized calling for Maroon 5 to drop out of the show and accusing them of \\"choosing to side with the NFL over its players.\\" In an interview, Kaepernick's attorney, Mark Geragos, compared Maroon 5's participation to strikebreaking, and argued that if the band wanted to cross the \\"intellectual picket line\\", they needed to \\"own it\\", explaining that \\"if anything, it's a cop out when you start talking about, 'I'm not a politician, I'm just doing the music.' Most of the musicians who have any kind of consciousness whatsoever understand what's going on here.\\" A week before the game, the halftime show's press conference was cancelled by the NFL. Although the league stated that Maroon 5 had wanted to focus on their preparations for the show, media outlets theorized that the band was trying to avoid the possibility of having to discuss the controversy. In an interview with Entertainment Tonight, Levine discussed the band's decision to accept the gig and explained, \\"I silenced all the noise and listened to myself and made my decision based upon how I felt... I'm not in the right profession if I can't handle a little bit of controversy. It's what it is. We expected it. We'd like to move on from it and speak through the music\\". In response to the controversy, Scott agreed to participate in the halftime show only if the NFL joined him in donating $500,000 to Dream Corps, an organization founded by Van Jones that supports social justice efforts. Maroon 5 subsequently announced that they had joined with the NFL and their label Interscope Records to donate the same amount to Big Brothers Big Sisters of America. Reception Dominic Patten of Deadline Hollywood called the show \\"terrible\\" and stated it lacked \\"lift-off or soul.\\" Writing for Yahoo! Entertainment, Lyndsey Parker called it the \\"dullest ... most underwhelming and instantly forgettable halftime show of all time.\\" Alex Suskind of Entertainment Weekly called it \\"lackluster\\" and \\"boring\\". Greg Kot of The Baltimore Sun called it an \\"empty-calorie display of corporate-pop competence.\\" Cl√©mence Michallon of The Independent gave it two stars out of five and stated it \\"failed to impress.\\" Jon Caramanica of The New York Times felt that \\"in a performance that was dynamically flat, mushy at the edges, worthy of something much worse than derision: a shrug. It was an inessential performance from a band that might have lost some moral authority if it had any moral authority to lose.\\" Rhian Daly of NME said it was \\"surprise-free, trite, and soulless\\" and \\"with Maroon 5's set, [Levine]'s given the world an easy target ‚Äì one that's boring, trite, and saying absolutely nothing of any value whatsoever.\\" Jake Nevins of The Guardian also gave the performance two out of five stars, writing \\"Adam Levine's torso can't save tedious affair.\\" However, Kevin Coffey of the Omaha World-Herald said \\"it was exactly what it needed to be.\\" Maeve McDermott of USA Today observed that the performance felt \\"safe\\" and \\"dialed-in\\", with \\"zero surprises and nothing that could add to the headache the league has already endured\\", and noting that Maroon 5's portions of the show relied heavily on early hits from their debut album rather than newer material (aside from \\"Sugar\\" and \\"Moves Like Jagger\\"). Feeling that the guest artists were more exciting (although noting Scott's portion, due to the SpongeBob SquarePants introduction and crowd surfing exit, was the only \\"genuinely weird\\" moment of the show), she wrote that the choice of Maroon 5 as headliner was \\"misguided\\" for a Super Bowl held in Atlanta, the \\"nexus of hip-hop\\", and that the show was \\"distinctive only for how uncontroversial it was, how wholly a missed opportunity it represented, and how much of Levine's truly abysmal dance moves we were all forced to watch.\\" The short clip featuring the cast of SpongeBob SquarePants was noted as a highlight of the show by several news outlets. However, fans of the animated show had a mixed reaction, with many expressing disappointment on social media that Maroon 5 did not play the song \\"Sweet Victory\\" as requested by the online petition. Fifty-five complaints were sent to the FCC over the halftime show, due to a sequence in which Levine removed his shirt. The complaints, alleged that it was a double standard for CBS to be fined for briefly showing a female breast on-air during a previous halftime show, but not receive equal or greater punishment for showing male breasts on air. Adam Levine respond after the performance with a message, he stated: \\"When we accepted the responsibility to perform at the SBHTS, I took out my pen and just wrote. Some of the words that came to me in that moment eventually make their way onto the incredible lanterns that flew high and low tonight. We thank the universe for this historic opportunity on the world's biggest stage. We thank our fans for making this possible. And we thank our critics for always pushing us to do better. One Love\\".

Plot  The movie introduces Sangraal, son of king Ator, whose realm and people are destroyed by evil warlord Nantuk. Sangraal and the remainder of his people flee his wrath and begin searching for a new home. After defending some villagers from an attack by Nantuk's troops, they gladly accept the newcomers as part of their community. Their leader, Belem, even offers Sangraal to become his co-ruler. Meanwhile, the warlord - who has assumed kinghood after Ator's fall - has angered the Goddess of Fire and Death, whom he owes his power and whose cult he leads: she demands that Sangraal be sacrificed; either that or Nantuk will lose his power, his kingdom and his life. Nantuk sends out more men to destroy the village sheltering Sangraal, and has his troops murder everyone while the captured and crucified protagonist must watch. He witnesses his wife's death at the hands of the Goddess of Fire and Death and falls unconscious before being freed by Belem's daughter, Ati, and Li Wo Twan, a travelling archer. After Ati and Li Wo Twan patch the barbarian up, Sangraal decides to visit the powerful wizard Rudak - he might have the power to bring his wife back to life. Meanwhile, Nantuk promises his Goddess to torture Sangraal and cast him into her fiery altar with his own hands. The trio narrowly manages to escape several ambushes and finally makes it to the mountain where Rudak dwells. Rudak, however, convinces Sangraal to finally let go of his dead wife, as no one has the power to bring back the dead. Instead, Sangraal must face his destiny and fight evil: he must seek out a shrine which contains everything he needs to win this battle. The journey ahead is dangerous, even without Nantuk's servants and their ambushes, but the trio is able to overcome all the obstacles and escape the traps set up for them. Despite getting captured several times, Sangraal finally manages to find the shrine Rudak had mentioned, which contains a powerful, magical crossbow. Meanwhile, Ati and Li Wo Twan are ambushed once more, leaving the archer dead and Ati captured. Sangraal then pursues Ati and her capturers all the way to Nantuk's headquarters, which contains the Goddesses' altar. He challenges the evil king to a duel, which the king agrees to - it will be fought according to the usual rules, meaning that none of his servants may interfere. After the barbarian gets the upper hand, Nantuk calls for help from his guards. However, they refuse, so he tries to make a run for it. The pursuit carries on for a while, but eventually, the two clash again at a beach, resulting in unarmed hand-to- hand combat. When Nantuk draws a concealed dagger, Sangraal manages to disarm his enemy by stepping on his wrist, with the dagger sticking blade up in the sand. With a slight push, Sangraal disposes of his enemy, who is impaled on his own dagger. Afterwards, the protagonist returns to the late king's cave, to find Ati abandoned by Nantuk's servants. Before they can leave, the Goddess reappears and threatens to take both Sangraal and Ati's life, laughing at the blade Sangraal considers swinging at her and burning it. But her laughter ends when the barbarian loads his magical crossbow and kills her with a shot in the gut. The movie ends with a shot of Sangraal and Ati riding into freedom.

East window of Old St. Paul's Episcopal Church, Baltimore, Maryland, by Helen Maitland Armstrong, above reredos by Louis Comfort Tiffany, photographed after 1933. The window depicts the glorification of God and was installed ca. 1904. Helen Maitland Armstrong (1869‚Äì1948) was an American stained glass artist who worked both solo and in partnership with her father, Maitland Armstrong. Her work is considered among the finest produced in America in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Early life Helen Maitland Armstrong was born in 1869 in Florence, Italy, to American diplomat and stained glass artist Maitland Armstrong and his wife Helen, who was a descendant of Peter Stuyvesant and a niece of the politician Hamilton Fish. Her six siblings included book designer and author Margaret Neilson Armstrong and magazine editor Hamilton Fish Armstrong. In 1878, the sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens, who was a friend of her father's, created a bronze portrait plaque of her from a photograph. She studied at the Art Students League of New York but received much of her artistic training from her father, who made her a junior partner in his firm of Maitland Armstrong & Co. Career Armstrong's oeuvre centers on stained glass windows for churches but also includes mosaics, murals, and illustrations. The stained glass she created both solo and in business partnership with her father until his death in 1918 is considered among the finest in late 19th and early 20th century America, ranking alongside the work of Louis Comfort Tiffany and John La Farge, both of whom were friends of Armstrong and her father. She is a member of the first generation of women artists to take advantage of the new stained glass techniques pioneered by La Farge and Tiffany, along with Lydia Field Emmet and her sister Rosina Emmet Sherwood. Her earliest work dates from the 1890s; in 1893, a cartoon for one of her stained glass windows was shown in the Women's Building at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. Armstrong and her father together created drawings for stained glass windows‚Äîmany of them memorials‚Äîfor the First Congregational Church (St. Louis, Missouri), Christ Church (Rye, New York), Jekyl Island Chapel (Brunswick, Georgia), First Presbyterian Church (Newburgh, New York), All Souls' Episcopal Church (Biltmore, North Carolina), Earl Memorial Chapel (Troy, New York), and Vassar College. Armstrong's solo work‚Äîwhich the New York Times termed \\"exceptional\\"‚Äîincluded stained glass window designs for dozens of churches and chapels, as well as a government building and several private residences. She designed 16 windows using a 15th-century painted-glass technique for a private mausoleum for Alva Belmont in Woodlawn Cemetery. One of her windows for St. Andrew's Dune Church in Southampton, New York, was blown out by the Great New England Hurricane of 1938 and found intact afterwards half a mile away. Armstrong's masterpiece may be the east window at Old St. Paul's Episcopal Church in Baltimore, Maryland, created as part of a general renovation of the church in 1904. Depicting the glorification of God, it is the focal point of the interior. Above it is a mural showing the Lamb of God, and beneath it is a stone reredos by Tiffany with other Christian symbols such as the peacock (symbolizing resurrection). Armstrong also illustrated a number of books for the publisher A.C. McClurg. Amstrong and her sister Margaret illustrated several books together, including Max M√ºller's 1906 Memories: A Story of German Love. Armstrong died in the house where she was raised at 58 W. 10th St. in New York City on November 26, 1948. The Metropolitan Museum in New York holds a collection of her drawings and watercolors for stained glass windows as well as designs for an altarpiece and a mural.

McClelland was also an expert on the European/American antiques. She was a writer for interior journals such as: Collier's, Country Life, House Beautiful, and House and Garden. She was an expert on wallpaper and the Scottish furniture designer Duncan Phyfe of New York. She received several rewards for her work. Being multilingual gave her the opportunity to be internationally active and to be known beyond the US as a writer, speaker, interior decorator, wallpaper designer, and collector of antique furniture. She traveled widely and met figures of the time such as Picasso. Throughout her career she was an advocate for the professionalization of interior decoration throughout various means such as training, experience, and professional organizations. Although not formally schooled in interior decoration, Nancy McClelland believed that her on-the-job training and study of architecture and antiques abroad, along with her experience, made her a professional. And she may have helped to write AID's 1931 definition of an interior decorator: \\"A decorator is one who, by training and experience, is qualified to plan, design and execute structural interiors and their furnishings, and to supervise the various arts and crafts essential to their completion.\\" Throughout her long career, she wrote and lectured about the necessity of training for decorators, which helped to separate professionals from the amateurs. In 1922, Harold Eberlein and she published a correspondence course calledThe Arts and Decoration Practical Home Study Course in Interior Decoration for both home and professional decorators. By the 1930s, she advocated a college education and, later, worked with AID to develop a four-year university curriculum that was \\"equivalent in scope to the comprehensive course in architecture\\" offered in universities.  Early life  McClelland was born in a middle-class family of Methodist ministers in Poughkeepsie, New York in 1877. In 1897, she received of a Bachelor of Arts in Latin and English from Vassar College in Poughkeepsie. She was a member of Phi Beta Kappa. She was multilingual and spoke French, Italian, German, and Spanish.  Career  McClelland first started her career as a reporter of stories of women's interests for the Philadelphia Press from 1897 to 1900. Next, McClelland worked in the advertising department of Wanamaker's Department Store, where she also had an opportunity to create window displays and store exhibits. She thus commenced her study on what she called \\"proper and effective arrangement.\\" From there, she traveled to Paris as a 'representative and buyer' for Wanamaker's. While in Paris, she studied art and art history, and visited places, such as chateaux and museums. She also began to study and collect wallpaper and antiques. During her stay, she met the leading French artist of the 20th century Pablo Picasso and also literary innovator and pioneer of Modernist literature Gertrude Stein. In 1913, McClelland returned to the US and opened Au Quartrieme on the fourth floor of Wanamaker's in New York, a shop that sold mostly European antiques. The first of its kind in a department store, it also held several sales of important American antiques too. In 1922, she left Wanamaker's and opened her own store, Nancy McClelland Inc. in New York City. The firm specialized in formal period- style interiors in 18th-century French styles in addition to English Regency, English Georgian, and American Colonial. McClelland also worked with such clients as Henry Francis DuPont, John D. Rockefeller, and Electra Havemeyer Webb. In addition, she restored and/or decorated various houses and museums, such as Mount Vernon, the plantation home of George Washington in Virginia, and the Henry Wadsworth Longfellow House in Portland, Maine. In 1924, she published her first book, Historic Wallpapers. A definitive study in its day, it remains an important source of information for wallpapers. She also wrote Duncan Phyfe & The English Regency (1939), which examined the work of the famous cabinet maker Duncan Phyfe. She believed the Regency period to be the most \\"polished\\", most \\"animated\\", and most \\"corrupt\\" era for the English society. Her other books were The Practical Book of Decorative Wall-Treatments (1926), Furnishing the Colonial and Federal House (1936), and The Young Decorators (1928), an early book about decorating for children. She also wrote numerous articles for magazines, including Collier's, Country Life, House Beautiful, and House and Garden. Ever an advocate for professionalism, McCelland was a member of the Decorator's Club and was one of the first woman decorators to join the Architectural League once it opened its membership to women in 1934. She was also a founding member of the American Institute of Interior Decorators (A.I.I.D.), which changed its name to American Institute of Decorators (A.I.D.) in 1936. In 1941, McClelland was elected as fifth, and first woman, president of A.I.D. She served from 1941 to 1944. During her tenure as president of A.I.D. the organization admitted students for the first time.  Honors  McClelland received several rewards, including the French Chevalier of the Legion of Honour in 1930, and the first annual Justin Allman Wallpaper Award wasgranted to her in 1946 by the National Walpaper Wholesaler's Association. She was awarded with the Michael Friedsam Medal of the Architectural League of New York for service to the cause of the industrial arts.  Legacy  Nancy Vicent McClelland died on October 1, 1959 at the age of 82. In memory of her and her work, her firm established a scholarship fund for A.I.D.

One of several facilities historically referred to as Elstree Studios, the Shenley Road studios first opened in 1925. The studio complex has passed through many owners during its lifetime, and is now owned by Hertsmere Borough Council. Known as the studios used for filming The Shining, Star Wars and Indiana Jones (its largest stage is known as the George Lucas Soundstage), the studios are used both for film and television productions. With the BBC Elstree Centre nearby, a number of the stages are leased to BBC Studioworks, and are used for recording television productions such as Strictly Come Dancing. History=British International and Associated British British National Pictures Ltd. purchased of land on the south side of Shenley Road and began construction of two large film stages in 1925. After discord among the partners, which by this time included Herbert Wilcox, their solicitor John Maxwell invested and was able to gain control of the company.Patricia Warren British Film Studios: An Illustrated History, London: B.T Batsford, 2001, p.61 The first film produced there was Madame Pompadour (1927). By 1927, Maxwell controlled all the stock, and the company was renamed British International Pictures (BIP) and the second stage was ready for production in 1928. Maxwell placed Alfred Hitchcock under contract in a 3-year, 12-picture deal, and after several silents, he was responsible for Blackmail (1929), the first British talkie released, which was produced at the studios. At the end of the silent- film era, six new sound stages were built; three of these were sold to the British & Dominions Film Corporation (see below) with BIP retaining the remaining stages. Elstree Calling (1930), made by BIP, was reputedly Britain's first musical film.Paul Duncan Alfred Hitchcock: Architect of Anxiety, 1899‚Äì1980, Taschen, 2003, p.46 Ian Conrich, Estella Tincknell Film's Musical Moments, Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2006, p.32. BIP became Associated British Picture Corporation (ABPC) in 1933. Maxwell died in 1940 and during World War II, the studios were used by the War Office for storage.Warren, p.71 In 1946, Warner Brothers acquired a substantial interest in ABPC, appointed a new board and decided to rebuild the stages. This was completed in 1948 and work began on Man on the Run followed by The Hasty Heart starring Richard Todd and Ronald Reagan. The Shenley Road studios were frequently used in the 1960s for productions by ABPC's television arm, ABC Television. Later episodes of The Avengers were among these. Several similar productions by ITC were also filmed there, including The Saint, The Baron and The Champions. All of these series made extensive use of a townscape standing set constructed at the rear of the studio site, originally for the 1961 Cliff Richard film The Young Ones. EMI and others The Main Gate entrance at Shenley Road (late 1990s). In 1969, Electrical and Musical Industries (EMI) finally gained control of ABPC and the studios were renamed EMI-Elstree Studios.Warren, p.76 In 1969, Bryan Forbes was appointed head of production of the film studio (see EMI Films). Dennis Barker, in his obituary of Forbes for The Guardian, states that \\"This amounted virtually to an attempt to revive the ailing British film industry by instituting a traditional studio system with a whole slate of films in play.\\"Barker, D.

Retrieved 9 May 2013 In his autobiography A Divided Life he states that \\"They were years of high hopes, of excitement, often of fulfilment and contrary to what various pundits said after the event, the programme proved a commercial success, returning according to the latest [1992] figures a profit in excess of ¬£16,000,000 on a capital outlay of ¬£4,000,000.\\"Bryan Forbes, A Divided Life -page 108 During the period 1970‚Äì73, when EMI had a short-lived production and distribution deal with the American MGM film company, the facilities were known as the EMI-MGM Elstree Studios. In 1974, Andrew Mitchell took over from Ian Scott as managing director of the studios but was almost immediately told to close the facility and lay off all the staff. Due to the sterling efforts of Mitchell and the help of John Reed who was on the board of EMI and Alan Sapper the head of the ACTT Union, he turned the studios into a Four Wall facility, which effectively meant reducing the staff to administration, with the exception of the Dubbing facility and having freelance crew being brought in by each production company. This was inevitable due to the changing nature of cinematic styles that relied increasingly on location shooting and the reduced financial involvement of EMI in its own film productions, thus rendering a permanent production staff employed full-time at the facility redundant. Films shot at the facility over the next few years included the Agatha Christie mystery film Murder on the Orient Express (1974), directed by Sidney Lumet; Ken Russell's Valentino (1977; Stanley Kubrick's The Shining (1980); Fred Zinnemann's drama film Julia (1977); and most significantly for the studio's immediate survival through a deal brokered by Andrew Mitchell, George Lucas with Star Wars (1977). This led to subsequent Lucas productions such as the Star Wars sequels and Indiana Jones franchise being made at Elstree and also brought in directors Steven Spielberg and Jim Henson. This was the golden era of the construction picture, which essentially required large studio facilities to fulfill the filmmakers' vision, before computer-generated imagery technology and Elstree became synonymous with this kind of picture due to the success of the Star Wars and Indiana Jones films. In 1979, Thorn Electrical Industries merged with EMI after EMI's debacle with its invention of the CT Scanner, and the studios were renamed Thorn-EMI Elstree Studios. Sale, partial demolition, and present The studios were put up for sale in 1985. A management team beat off all other prospective buyers with the help of Alan Bond but the team had difficulty raising their share of the purchase price and Bond took over. Soon afterwards he sold the studios to the Herron-Cannon Group in 1986. In 1988, Cannon sold the studios to the leisure and property company Brent Walker plc and much of the backlot was sold off and demolished with a Tesco superstore being built on the land. The Elstree Studios facility hosts some historic soundstages. Stages at Elstree Studios. A \\"Save Our Studios\\" campaign was launched in 1988 by managing director, Andrew Mitchell, local Town Councillor and studio historian Paul Welsh, with the support of many film actors and the general public. Hertsmere Borough Council stepped in and bought the remaining facilities in February 1996 and appointed a management company, Elstree Film & Television Studios Ltd., to run the studios in 2000. The purchase ended an eight-year struggle that was due to have culminated in High Court action. Brent Walker's offer to sell the site to the Council, for an undisclosed sum (but no more than its worth as a film studio), represented a victory for the local authority in upholding the planning agreements that protected the studios. The studios are now most commonly known for being the home of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? and the Big Brother UK house (previously at Three Mills Studios in Bow, East London). The Big Brother house was actually built on top of the studios' old underwater stage where scenes in The Dam Busters (1955) and Moby- Dick (1956) were filmed. Elstree Film & Television Studios Ltd's lease expired at the end of March 2007. It was announced in 2012 that the studios would be the temporary home of BBC Studios and Post Production during the redevelopment of Television Centre. Shows such as Strictly Come Dancing and Pointless were based on the site from spring 2013. The original plan was for the BBC to move back to refurbished Television Centre studios in 2015, however due to delays in the broader redevelopment of the old Television Centre site in July 2014, the lease was extended until 2017. Elstree Studios are now operated by Elstree Film Studios Ltd, a company controlled by Hertsmere Borough Council. Feature film production continues alongside television production, commercials and pop promos; recent productions include 44\\" Chest, Bright Star, 1408, Son of Rambow, Amazing Grace, The Other Boleyn Girl, Notes on a Scandal, Breaking and Entering, Flyboys, Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, Star Wars: Episode II ‚Äì Attack of the Clones and Star Wars: Episode III ‚Äì Revenge of the Sith, Dancing on Ice and Are You Smarter Than A 10 Year Old? for Sky television among many others. On 25 November 2019 it was announced that Elstree Studios would continue with their partnership with BBC Studioworks to provide television studio facilities.

She initially gained recognition as the first African American winner of the Miss America title when she was crowned Miss America 1984 in September 1983. Several weeks before the end of her reign, however, a scandal arose when Penthouse magazine bought and published unauthorized nude photographs of Williams. Williams was pressured to relinquish her title, and was succeeded by the first runner-up, Miss New Jersey 1983, Suzette Charles. She was the first Miss America to give up her crown. Thirty-two years later, in September 2015, when Williams served as head judge for the Miss America 2016 pageant, former Miss America CEO Sam Haskell made a public apology to her for the events of 1984. Miss America 1984 When she was 20 years old, Williams was approached by scouts from the Miss Syracuse pageant who had seen her perform while a student at Syracuse University. Despite their encouragement, Williams was not interested in participating in the pageant. She later changed her mind when she realized that she could earn scholarship money. Although she had never participated in a beauty pageant before, she won the title of Miss Syracuse in April 1983. She then went on to win Miss New York in July 1983 During the preliminaries for the Miss America pageant, Williams won \\"Preliminary Swimsuit\\" and \\"Preliminary Talent\\" (with a vocal performance of \\"Happy Days Are Here Again\\"). She was also crowned Miss America 1984 on September 17, 1983, becoming the first African American woman to win the title. During her reign as Miss America, Williams was criticized in some venues for winning. She later stated that \\"there were a lot of people that did not want me to be representative of the United States and Miss America. And not just white people alone. There were a lot of people who had issues ... I was too light. My eyes were the wrong color. My hair wasn't the right texture and getting criticism for being who I was.\\" She was also the target of persistent racist hate mail and death threats (which she documented in her memoir, You Have No Idea). Thirty years later, when Miss America 2014 Nina Davuluri (who was also a former Miss New York and Miss Syracuse) became the target of a racist social media backlash, Williams recounted the similarities with her own experiences, stating that she \\"wrote a book about everything that I went through, and I spent a lot of time talking about the death threats, the FBI, the sharpshooters ... it was a graver situation and more dangerous years ago‚Äîthe change that was happening and the uproar because of the color of my skin.\\" Williams would later comment that she was one of five minority contestants that year, noting that ballet dancer Deneen Graham \\"had already had a cross burned on her front yard because she was the first black Miss North Carolina [1983].\\" She also pointed out that \\"Suzette Charles was the first runner-up, and she was biracial. But when the press started, when I would go out on the‚Äîon the tour and do my appearances, and people would come up and say they never thought they'd see the day that it would happen; when people would want to shake my hand, and you'd see tears in their eyes, and they'd say, I never thought I'd see it in my lifetime‚Äîthat's when, you know, it was definitely a very special honor.\\" Resignation In July 1984 (two months before the end of her reign), Williams learned that nude photos of her, taken before her involvement with the pageant, would be published without her consent in a future issue of Penthouse. Williams believed that the private photographs had been destroyed; she stated that she never signed a release permitting publication or use of the photos in a public format. In contrast, Hugh Hefner, the publisher of Playboy, was also given the opportunity to publish these photos but turned it down stating: \\"The single victim in all of this was the young woman herself, whose right to make this decision was taken away from her. If she wanted to make this kind of statement, that would be her business, but the statement wasn't made by her.\\" The black-and-white photos dated back to the summer of 1982 (after her freshman year at Syracuse University) when she worked as an assistant and makeup artist for Mount Kisco, New York photographer Tom Chiapel. At the time, Williams stated that Chiapel said that \\"he had a concept of having two models pose nude for silhouettes, basically to make different shapes and forms. The light would be behind the models. I was reluctant, but since he assured me that I would be the only one to see them and I would not be identifiable in the photographs, I agreed. He had also gotten another model to agree to this.\\" In a 2012 interview with NPR, Williams discussed these events stating that her mother: > Kept saying, \\"you're just like your father; you're too trusting\\". And > there's a part of me that, I do give people the benefit of the doubt ... > it's also being free ... that was the mode I was in at that particular time, > when I took those racy pictures, because I was already in college so you > can't tell me what to do. So‚ÄîI wasn't actually in high school‚Äîso my > mentality was what‚ÄîI'm living my own life; I'm a spirited, young woman; I > can handle this; I can handle anything. And at 19, you think you rule the > world, and you can control things. And a lot of times, you don't. After learning that Penthouse would be publishing these photos, the Miss America Organization responded by giving Williams 72 hours to resign. Williams later stated that \\"the heightened spectacle and circus of it all was kind of crazy. I had people saying 'Fight for the crown! Fight for the crown!' and people chanting 'Don't give it up! Don't secede! Williams also later noted that the situation was particularly hard on her mother Helen, who felt that she should not resign as Williams had performed her \\"duties and excelled at everything I was asked to do plus doing 50% more of appearances that were not scheduled because I was the first African American Miss America.\\" Helen was also upset that \\"the pageant did not come to my support, they felt I needed to resign.\\" Williams, however, decided to resign, and formally announced her decision at a press conference held on July 23, 1984. The title subsequently went to the first runner-up, Miss New Jersey Suzette Charles who served out the final seven weeks of Williams' reign. On September 7, 1984, Williams filed a $500 million lawsuit against Chiapel and Penthouse publisher Bob Guccione; she dropped the lawsuit a year later stating that she wanted to put the scandal behind her. Ultimately, Penthouse published the unauthorized photos in its September 1984 issue, which the PBS documentary Miss America described as \\"the most successful issue Penthouse magazine ever printed, netting Guccione a windfall profit of $14 million.\\" 1984‚Äì2015 After her resignation, Williams rebounded as a recording artist and actress. However, she also faced a long period of what she would later describe as \\"the betrayal, and the humiliation, that happened to me on a grand scale.\\"Essence magazine concurred stating that Williams was the subject of \\"public shaming and bullying from the public at large\\" and The Philadelphia Inquirer noted that her \\"career and reputation tanked. Overnight, [Williams] went from being America's darling to a national disgrace.\\" She would also later state that these events delayed her career by about ten years, as \\"it seemed like an eternity in which I was the punch line to every late-night monologue ... Joan Rivers, whom I adored and met on The Tonight Show during my reign, was particularly relentless. Just when I figured she'd exhausted every possible Vanessa Williams joke, she'd have a whole new slew of them.\\" Williams would also later tell of one audition that she had during the late 1980s for a theatrical role. She was denied the role, however, because \\"the wife of lyricist Ira Gershwin decreed: 'Over my dead body will that whore be in my show. In addition, her parents experienced \\"an incredible amount of shame and humiliation\\" and were equally the subject of harassment at the time. Thirty years after the scandal broke, Amanda Marcotte suggested in The Daily Beast that > we owe a lot to Vanessa Williams for being a pioneer when it comes to > showing the world how to recover when you've been unjustly shamed for being > sexual. Williams could have slunk off into the shadows in shame, which no > doubt many people at the time expected her to do. Williams picked herself up > and kept fighting for a career as an entertainer, first by becoming a > successful singer and then becoming a well-known comic actress ... Sleazy > people tried to drag Vanessa Williams down with accusations of being sexual > 30 years ago, but she moved on, showing she had nothing to be ashamed of. In addition, Williams commented on her ability to persevere after these events in a 2015 interview with Entertainment Tonight by stating that \\"you can't give up ... you always have to remember what you're made of and not let circumstances get in the way. They might delay your progress for the moment, but you always have to remember who you are, and that will give you the eyes on the prize.\\" Miss America 2016 Williams at the conclusion of her performance of \\"Oh How the Years Go By\\" at Miss America 2016 Thirty-two years later, Williams returned to the Miss America stage on September 13, 2015, where she served as head judge for Miss America 2016 and sang \\"Oh How the Years Go By\\". After this performance, former Miss America CEO Sam Haskell issued a public apology to Williams, stating: > I have been a close friend of this beautiful and talented lady for 32 years. > You have lived your life in grace and dignity, and never was it more evident > than during the events of 1984, when you resigned. Though none of us > currently in the organization were involved then, on behalf of today's > organization, I want to apologize to you and to your mother, Miss Helen > Williams. I want to apologize for anything that was said or done that made > you feel any less the Miss America you are and the Miss America you always > will be. Williams responded by stating that she did the \\"best that I could, in my reign as Miss America, from 1983 to 1984.\\" A few months after the pageant, Williams discussed the apology in an interview with Gayle King, Charlie Rose, and Norah O'Donnell for CBS This Morning. King asked her about the circumstances that led to it stating, \\"I think many people were touched when the Miss America pageant issued an apology to you.\\" Williams credited Haskell (who was one of her judges during the Miss America 1984 pageant) for orchestrating her return. While both she and her mother initially responded with hesitation to the invitation, Williams finally agreed to participate on the condition that she could sing her song \\"Oh How the Years Go By\\" (to symbolize the passing of time since she was Miss America). She did not know what Haskell would say, stating that she was simply told to stand and wait for him during the commercial break that would take place after her song. It was only when he arrived and placed his hand on her back (where she noticed that his hand was shaking) that Williams realized something significant was about to happen. Williams said that one of the most important outcomes of the apology was the positive impact that it had on her mother, who \\"endured a lot\\" during that period. After the pageant, Williams' replacement Suzette Charles stated in an interview with Inside Edition that she was perplexed over the apology and suggested that it was given for the purpose of ratings. Williams had previously commented on the events surrounding her return, stating in an interview with Robin Roberts that \\"there's a lot of people who feel I should return, so the people who harbor the resentment I understand it but realize that all of those people that were part of the old guard are no longer there.\\" In the same interview, Roberts mentioned to Williams that in the present day (c. 2015), \\"people now release [similar] things to make a career.\\" Williams responded: \\"That's crazy. To think that oh you can look at a scandal and think that that would be good for your career, where for me it took every ounce of credibility and talent that I had and wiped it out.\\" NotesFurther reading=Articles *\\"Vanessa Williams: New Miss America (cover story).\\" Jet, October 10, 1983. *\\"Here She is: Beautiful, brainy, and black, Vanessa Williams is by no means your ordinary beauty queen.\\" Ebony, December 1983: 132‚Äì136. *\\"Ex-Miss America Endures Pain, Embarrassment Sparked by Flap Over Nude Pictures.\\" Jet, August 6, 1984: 60‚Äì62. *\\"Letters to the Editor: Miss America.\\" Ebony, October, 1984.

It was built in s by South Sea Islander labour. It is also known as Dry-rubble Boundary Wall. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 13 May 1996.  History  The former Sunnyside sugar plantation, which initially comprised , is situated on Windermere Road, to the east of Bundaberg. The property was established by Edward Turner in 1875, and used to grow sugar from the early 1880s, in which work South Sea Islanders were employed until the turn of the century. In 1884 Turner established a juice mill on the property, piping his cane juice to the Millaquin refinery. Remnants of the sugar plantation era include two weeping fig trees (Ficus benjamina), an area of 29 burials in three rows, as well as a dry-rubble wall along Windermere Road. Initially the wall extended almost the full road frontage of Portion 85, but it has been reduced to about half this length (). The economy of Bundaberg was underpinned by the sugar industry from the early 1880s. During the late 19th century when South Sea Islanders were employed, it progressed from being the second largest sugar producing region in Queensland to the largest by 1900. The employment of Islanders was always controversial; a raft of legislation being introduced to protect their welfare in response to incidents of exploitation, and then to phase out their employment in favour of the use of white labour. The township of Bundaberg was established on the banks of the Burnett River. Timbergetters came through the area in the 1860s and were later followed by sugar planters taking advantage of the lands made available under the Crown Lands Alienation Act 1860 and the 1865 Coffee and Sugar Regulations. By 1868 the district surveyor John Thompson was instructed to mark out a town on the south bank of the river. This was completed by 1869 and the town was declared a port of entry in June 1871. The port serviced the copper mines of Mount Perry, although in competition with the nearby port of Maryborough. Sugar became the industry which underpinned the prosperity of Bundaberg, with the first of many sugar mills there established by Richard Palmer in 1872. Edward Turner, his wife Janet and daughter Pauline arrived in Hervey Bay aboard the \\"Sultana\\" in 1866. A native of Oswestry, Shropshire, England and a stonemason/bricklayer by trade, Turner reputedly first went prospecting on the Palmer River goldfields. He then worked as a stonemason for Robert Cran at his plantation Yengarie, west of Maryborough. Turner purchased a town allotment in Churchill Street, Maryborough, in 1867 which he sold in mid 1874. He then selected in the Woongarra Scrub to the east of Bundaberg in June 1874. His selection, Portion 85, comprised of agricultural land and 40 (16ha) of second class pastoral. He lived on the property which he named \\"Sunnyside\\" from January 1875. By the following year Turner had cleared and cultivated 18 acres. He built a slab house with three rooms and a kitchen with a brick oven and a number of outbuildings; established a waterhole and a well; built a pigsty and a calf paddock and was growing maize at this time. By 1880 he had 20 acres under cultivation, with an unknown crop. Turner fulfilled the conditions of his selection under the Crown Lands Alienation Act 1868 and in 1881 he applied to purchase the property, and a deed of grant was issued. Turner used South Sea Islander labour, as did most farmers in the district. The use of South Sea Islander labour had been pioneered in Australia in the 1840s by Benjamin Boyd in the New South Wales (NSW) Riverina District, employing them as shepherds in lieu of convict labour. The procurement of South Sea Islander labour to Queensland was initiated by Captain Robert Towns. He had been involved in the importation of Asiatic labourers during the 1840s and 1850s in NSW, and was also part of a push for the use of Indian coolie labour in the early 1860s in Queensland. At the time the concept that labouring in the tropics was unhealthy for Europeans had widespread currency. The Queensland Government removed restrictions on the introduction of Asiatic labour in May 1861, which led to the introduction of South Sea Island labourers to Queensland. Robert Towns' first group of 67 South Sea Islanders arrived in Brisbane on the \\"Don Juan\\" on 14 August 1863. They went to work on his cotton plantation Townsvale (later Veresdale) on the Logan River, where Towns hoped to capitalise on declining cotton production in America during the Civil War. Captain Claudius Whish used Islanders on his Oaklands Sugar Mill near Caboolture as did Captain Louis Hope on his Ormiston sugar plantation at Ormiston, near Cleveland. In 1865 a group of Islanders was landed at Bowen, to be employed by pastoralists. By March 1868, 2107 Islanders had been brought to Queensland, employed in various capacities including agricultural and pastoral work, and as servants in the towns. They lived and worked anywhere from Mackay and Bowen, to the Wide Bay district and west to Roma. South Sea Islanders were generally employed on three-year contracts bound by the Masters and Servants Act 1861. By 1868, there were reports that the recruitment of South Sea Islanders had devolved into kidnapping (a practice known as blackbirding). In response the Polynesian Labourers Act 1868 was enacted to regulate recruitment. Under the Act, the Islanders were required to sign a contract for up to three years, on a minimum wage of ¬£6 per year plus rations and a trip home after three years. Deaths and desertions were to be reported to the nearest magistrate. In 1870 government agents were appointed to sail with the recruiting vessels to supervise the conditions of appointment. During the 1870s and 1880s there was ongoing public criticism and political debate about the use of Islander labour. The number of recruitments increased from 1539 in 1868 to 10,057 by 30 June 1884. A number of Acts of Parliament were introduced to protect the Islanders from unscrupulous recruiters and employers including the Kidnapping Act of 1872 and the Pacific Islanders Labourers Act 1875. Following a Select Committee enquiry into Polynesian Labour, further amendments were initiated in 1877 and 1878 but not legislated. Then in December 1880 new Premier Thomas McIlwraith rescinded the 1868 Act, introducing a new Pacific Islander Labourers Act 1880 which set limitations on the age of recruits, their living conditions, medical service and ration provisions. Islanders could only be employed in tropical or semi-tropical agriculture, including the cultivation of sugar cane, cotton, tea, coffee, rice and spices. South Sea Islanders working in Bundaberg had initially arrived through Maryborough. The first direct shipment into the Port of Bundaberg occurred in May 1879, by the schooner \\"Lucy and Adelaide\\". The Islanders numbered 81 males and seven females. The number contracted to each farm or plantation is unknown. Labourers were recruited from a number of locations including the Solomon Islands, New Hebrides, and Loyalty Islands, all with different languages and customs. This region is now known as Melanesia, and includes the Bismark Archipelago of Papua New Guinea. Despite claims that Edward Turner was personally involved in the recruitment trade, no evidence has been found indicating his ownership of any boat engaged in recruiting Islanders. Turner continued to plan the development of his farm. In December 1883 he subdivided a two and a half acre lot (Sub 1, Portion 185) (1ha) from the north-western corner of his allotment along Windermere Road. A juice mill was established on this site, in partnership with Frederic and Charles Buss. They had a number of sugar plantations and numerous business interests in the region, including a store in town that became Buss and Turner in 1886 after James Edwin Turner (no relation to Edward Turner) from Sydney joined the firm. Edward Turner's juice mill was operational by 1884, when cane was crushed and the juice piped to the Millaquin Refinery (established 1881) for treatment. Juice mills were commonplace in the area with 24 established between 1882 and 1884, including at Ashgrove, Avoca, Fairymead, Glenmorris, Grange, Kepnock, Mabbro, Summerville, Windermere, and Woodbine by October 1883. Hummock, Oakwood, and Spring Hill mills were established in 1883 and Seaview, Mon Repos, and Sunnyside and Woodlands in 1884. Sunnyside's juice mill site (Sub 1), was transferred to Edward Turner's sole ownership in March 1888. In order to ensure the viability of the juice mill, Turner acquired another parcel of land on the southern slopes of The Hummock (Portion 87) in October 1888. This expanded his property to , financed by a ¬£2000 mortgage from the Commercial Banking Company of Sydney against the Sunnyside property. Sunnyside was typical of the smaller family-run sugar plantations in Bundaberg, which were generally between . Many had their own juice mills, piping juice to Millaquin refinery - as opposed to the large plantations such as Fairymead, of and Bingera of which had large mills. The type of work undertaken by the South Sea Islanders on the property and their conditions were summarised by the eldest son Herbert Turner in his 1955 publication: \\"Rural Life in Sunny Queensland\\". He indicated that a property of approximately 150 acres with a juice mill required about 45 Islanders. The first duty of an owner was to supply each Islander with a new blanket, clothing, and a hat, a plug of tobacco, which was subsequently supplied weekly, and the clothing half-yearly. His pay was between ¬£20 and ¬£25 which was paid half yearly at the Immigration Depot in the presence of the Inspector of Polynesians. Three meals were supplied daily, as specified by Government regulations. While some of the properties had been cleared initially by the selectors, the role of the Islanders was to clear the remaining virgin scrub: felling, burning and clearing the large volcanic stones, which were collected and sometimes drilled and blasted. Rocks unearthed during this process were placed on wooden sleds, pulled by draught horses. Big rocks which would not fit on the sled would be broken up with spalling hammers. These pieces would then be placed on corn bags; an Islander on each corner, it would then be carried to the sled. When full, the sleds were taken to the end of the paddock where they were unloaded. Dry-rubble walls were constructed in layers, with larger stones placed around the outside and smaller stones used for infill. This seems to have been a common construction method in the Woongarra and was employed at Sunnyside to make a wall along the northern boundary of the property. About 6 examples of it remain in the Bundaberg district, including one associated with the former Mon Repos sugar plantation and entered in the Queensland Heritage Register (the South Sea Islander Wall). Edward Turner was a stonemason and it is probable that he directed construction of the wall at Sunnyside. The creation of dry-stone boundary walls was commonplace in England where many of Queensland's settlers originated. Islanders were also employed in planting cane, by following behind a horse-drawn plough driven by a European, and dropping cane plants into the furrows. Similarly at harvest time, the Islanders would be involved in cutting and loading cane into horse- drawn drays driven by Europeans. Inspectors of Polynesians monitored the health and welfare of the Islanders. The first appointed to oversee Bundaberg and Maryborough in 1875 was also the sub-collector of customs. His 1877 replacement Charles Horrocks regularly inspected accommodation, clothing and weighed the food rations for the Islanders. Instances of large numbers of Islanders dying on individual farms were investigated, with one of the worst examples being those employed by Robert Cran at his Maryborough plantations of Yerra Yerra, Yengari and Ilawarra. Seven deaths occurred at Yerra Yerra in 1878 due to dysentery from contaminated water. Again in 1880 a high mortality rate led to a medical investigation which blamed poor food, long working hours, bad water, and a lack of proper care for the sick. The first inspector to be specifically allocated to Bundaberg was William O'Connell in 1882. The death rate remained high amongst the Islander population. Statistics provided to Parliament in 1888 indicated there had been 40,861 Islanders brought to Queensland since 1868, with 23,700 returned to their islands and 7635 deaths, although it was noted that not all deaths had been reported. While the statistics provided annually were broken down by district, they were not provided in relation to specific plantations. For example, in 1892, there were 186 deaths in Bundaberg, which was 66 more than the previous year, with dysentery a common cause. The rates remained high in subsequent years also, with 181 Islanders dead in 1893 and 175 in 1894. Economic historian Ralph Schlomowitz suggests that a general lack of immunity to a range of diseases to which Europeans had developed a partial immunity, such as measles, smallpox, influenza, tuberculosis, pneumonia, typhoid, dysentery and meningitis, proved fatal to both indigenous Australians and South Sea Islanders. He argued that the overall death rate of Pacific Islanders decreased from an average of 80 per 1000 (1879‚Äì87) to 35 per 1000 by 1893, suggesting that immunity built up over time. However, Islander deaths in Bundaberg appeared to be increasing. This was evidenced in statistics provided for the large plantations between December 1895 and December 1900, where Bingera experienced 135 deaths and Fairymead 58, both with increasing annual rates during this timeframe. Deaths on Sunnyside occurred in both the Turner family and amongst the Islander labourers in the late 1880s to early 1890s. The Bundaberg Genealogical Association, using newspaper sources, identified seven reported deaths of Islanders on Sunnyside plantation; these being Coora, 9/09/1887; Tartal 24/04/1888; Yantircca 12/03/1888; Byeena 21/08/1888; Beeteah 12/01/1889; Charlie 18/02/1889 and Neeoo 17/02/1889. The causes of these people's deaths are unknown, and the location of their burials is not known. It was commonplace to bury Islanders on the sugar plantations on which they worked. Over 600 Islanders were also buried in the Bundaberg general cemetery, the earliest recorded in 1879. Oral tradition states that a number of Islanders who worked on Sunnyside were buried on the property. Investigations undertaken by the Bundaberg Regional Council in 2012-13 indicated the location of 29 possible graves to the south-east of the two mature fig trees. Deaths in the Turner family over this period have been attributed to typhoid, reputedly from drinking contaminated water from the well. Eldest daughter Pauline Fielding died in November 1889, followed by fourteen year old Isabella in December. Then their mother Janet Turner died in January 1890. It is likely that some Islanders on Sunnyside may also have succumbed to typhoid at this time. A further family death occurred in October 1894, when Edward's 19-year-old son Clarence drowned in the waterhole after suffering an epileptic fit. His body was found by his brother-in-law, Henry Albert Cattermull. In the meantime, a change in government in 1883 led to new laws aimed at excluding Islander labour. The preference for white labour was implicit in the Pacific Islanders Labourers Act 1884 which was much more specific than the 1880 Act in relation to the type of work an Islander could be employed in, specifically restricting them to field work. The Pacific Island Labourers' Amendment Act 1885 legislated against the issue of recruitment licences for Islanders after 31 December 1890. The Crown Lands Act 1884 in tandem with the Sugar Works Guarantee Act 1884 moved to establish small family-run farms underpinned by the opening up of former crown land and leases. Interim measures to compensate for the loss of cheaper Islander labour included the commencement of the government-supported, co-operatively- owned central mill system and some government-owned mills. The first of these was established in Mackay in 1886, to only crush cane cut by white labour. In early 1889, a Royal Commission inquired into the viability of the sugar industry which was in decline at that time. From its 1865 initiation by Louis Hope, the industry had expanded rapidly over the subsequent twenty years. However, there was a marked decline between 1885 and 1893, attributed to drought and a slump in world sugar prices. Bundaberg farmers formed a small company which set up a rum distillery in 1888 which helped the industry through these hard times. Edward Turner's evidence to the commission indicated that he owned in total, 110 (44.5ha) of which were under sugar cultivation, and a further 20 (8ha) cultivated for other purposes. He employed seven Europeans and 45 Islanders. His total wage bill for 1888 was ¬£588 to Europeans and ¬£1420 to the Islanders, which indicates an annual income of ¬£84 for a European and ¬£31.10/- for an Islander. At that time he considered he could not successfully run the plantation without South Sea Islander labour. By the end of 1891 it was evident that the prohibition of Islander labour would lead to the collapse of the sugar industry. New legislation was enacted in April 1892, stipulating conditions of employment for Islanders. It has been argued in Raymond Evans' \\"History of Queensland\\" (2007) that following the rewriting of the legislation the recruitment of Islanders was a reformed business, with so many pieces of protective legislation, regulation and inspection schedules in place that the prospects of exploitation and ill- treatment of workers were substantially reduced. Islanders became more skilled in negotiations and bargained for higher wages and more liberal contracts. This occurred on Sunnyside in 1893. A new Inspector of Polynesians in Bundaberg, Henry St George Caulfield was appointed in April 1887. Caulfield had 13 years experience overseeing immigrant labour in Ceylon, and was thought to be \\"zealous in his duties as an inspector of plantations, and investigator of islanders' complaints against their employers\\". In July 1893, seven Islanders from Sunnyside Plantation complained to Caulfield that they were not being given enough food. Earlier that week they had burnt down one of their huts and set fire to the cane in protest. The Capricornian newspaper described the events as a \\"Kanaka strike\\". The Inspector came to Sunnyside and after interviewing others on the farm agreed they had not been given enough food. Caulfield referred to an earlier case dating from 1890 where it was proved Edward Turner supplied insufficient food. Turner was charged with breaching the Masters and Servants Act, and was fined. The agreement with the Islander named Tong, who brought the charge to the court, was cancelled. Tong said he had never received good food from Turner in the five years he had worked there, but that this was the first time he had complained to Caulfield. Turner had remarried a widow, Sarah Barney, who brought five children to the marriage. It was Sarah's responsibility to provide food, although Edward was held accountable. Turner was also charged with assaulting an Islander named Raincombe. This occurred during the July banking crisis, where eight of Queensland's banks closed, including the Commercial Banking Company of Sydney with which Turner had his ¬£2000 mortgage. While this would not justify the insufficient supply of food to Islander labourers on Sunnyside, it does suggest one reason for it to have happened. Most banks reopened by August. Initiatives to improve the general health and welfare of South Sea Islanders in Bundaberg included an Islanders' hospital, designed by the Government Architect and built at a cost of ¬£512 in 1893. The provision of a hospital had been referred to in the Pacific Islanders Immigration Act 1892, although it was not mandatory. Christian guidance was provided by Florence Young of Fairymead Plantation who started the Queensland Kanaka Mission in 1886, as an evangelical and non-denominational church (South Sea Islander Church). The Anglican Church was active in converting the Islanders who attended Sunday Service, while also providing evening classes teaching them to read. The process of sugar growing, crushing and refining changed dramatically in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, initiated in part by the Sugar Works Guarantee Act 1893 which provided for construction of government-supported central mills, employing white labour. Sixty farmers from Gin Gin were the first in the region to successfully establish a co-operative mill in 1896. Bundaberg was the second largest sugar producing region in Queensland between 1880 and 1900 when Islanders were employed. It produced 5797 tons (5890 tonnes) to Mackay's 12,023 tons (12,215 tonnes) in 1884. While all centres continually improved their output during the late 19th century, Bundaberg's output gradually closed the gap with Mackay. In 1893 Bundaberg produced 23,423 tons (23,798 tonnes) to Mackay's 24,872 (25,271 tonnes). By 1900, some sugar produced in Childers, Maryborough and Tiaro was processed in Bundaberg, and their production statistics were then included with Bundaberg, skewing the statistics in Bundaberg's favour. In 1900, 59,076 tons (60,023 tonnes) were produced, compared with 17,521 (17,802 tonnes) in Mackay. By that time Ingham had out-produced Mackay with 20,222 tons (20,546 tonnes). During 1901-1902 the Sunnyside property, including the juice mill site was transferred into the ownership of Edward Turner's eldest son Herbert Turner and son-in-law Henry Cattermull. They had phased out Islander labour on the property by then. In February 1902, Herbert married Annie Thomas, the daughter of William Thomas, the engineer who designed and managed the Millaquin Mill. They built a house on The Hummock property, Portion 107, which was known in the family as \\"Top Farm\\". Edward Turner moved to a new property at Maroondan near Gin Gin. Sunnyside was reputedly one of the few plantations in the Bundaberg district able to produce and crush during the drought of 1900-1903. Following Federation, the White Australia Policy predicated the end of Islander labour. New acts were introduced by the Commonwealth Government, requiring the end of South Sea Islander recruitment from 31 March 1904 and deportation of all Islanders by 31 December 1906. However, there were exemptions for those who had arrived prior to 1879; who had married women not of their race; whose children were being educated in state schools; and those who possessed freehold land or who were fearful of their lives if returned to their former homes. The Sugar Labour Commission, established to report on the repatriation of Pacific Islanders, took evidence in Bundaberg in April 1906. Frank Courtice, city organiser of the Bundaberg District Workers Union, said he supported the development of the State refinery system and the cutting up of plantations into smaller farms run by individual farmers. This concept was supported by Henry Albert Cattermull, overseer on Sunnyside, who said he had used white labourers since 1902, who were mostly local farmers' sons, and he found them more reliable than itinerant workers. Henry St George Caulfield also gave evidence in relation to the number of Islanders still in the district, which he estimated to be 1100. There had been some problems returning South Sea Islanders to their homes and others were keen to remain in Queensland. During the 1893 economic crisis, the Queensland National Bank formed a company known as Qunaba (QUeensland NAtional BAnk) which took over the financially struggling Millaquin refinery. It erected a new juice mill on site in 1906, making the small private juice mills obsolete. Millaquin then acquired numerous other plantations in the early 1900s. Sunnyside sold its cane to Windermere in 1911, and then Millaquin acquired both Windermere and The Hummock by 1912. Changes in Sunnyside's ownership occurred in the early 20th century. Edward Turner died in April 1910, having been thrown from his horse at Maroondan. His property was divided between his son Herbert and son- in-law Henry Albert Cuttermull and his unmarried daughter Gertrude. His second wife Sarah had committed suicide in April 1907. The Sunnyside juice mill was closed down in 1911. In 1922 the Sunnyside Plantation was transferred to Benjamin and Sydney Herbert Courtice. They took out a ¬£6000 mortgage with Cattermull. By that time Cattermull was a local councillor, having been president of the Cane Growers Union formed in 1908. Ben Courtice was later Chairman of the Cane Growers Association. Cattermull died in 1935 and the mortgage over the plantation was transferred to his executors. Another of the Courtice brothers, Fred, was a Labor Party member of the Queensland Legislative Council and became Chairman of the Woongarra Shire in the 1940s. Ben Courtice became a Senator in 1937 and was Minister for Trade and Customs from 1946 until 1949. The former Sunnyside plantation remains in the ownership of the Courtice family. The grave of former owner Sidney Thomas Courtice 1/04/1922-13/08/2007) is located under the westernmost of the two mature fig trees on the northern part of the property and is not considered to be of state heritage significance. Some subdivision has occurred on Sunnyside, with a number of large house sites excised along Windermere Road including Lot 5 on RP 179915 in 1981; Lot 7 on RP 893076 in 1995; and Lot 8 on RP 825941 in 1997. The two mature fig trees on the property were likely to have been planted toward the end of the period that Islanders worked there and were used to mark the entrance to the house (original house no longer extant). Weeping fig trees (Ficus benjamina) are not native to the Bundaberg region and were known to have been introduced as street trees in Bourbong Street in 1891 (Bourbong Street Weeping Figs). It is also known that local bank manager, member of the Queensland Acclimatisation Society and trustee of the Bundaberg Botanic Gardens, William Fullerton, was cultivating them for distribution around the town in 1897. It is likely the two fig trees growing at Sunnyside today were planted after this time. The Bundaberg and District South Sea Islanders Action Group was formed in the 1980s to improve understanding of the history of South Sea Islander peoples in the area and their important contribution to the sugar industry, and to locate sites significant to this history. The group has indicated it has a strong association with the fig trees, burials and dry- rubble wall on Sunnyside. The listing originally focused on the wall remains, but was substantially expanded in 2013 to include the fig trees and graves after a long campaign by the Action Group in conjunction with the current owner, former federal MP Brian Courtice, a staunch advocate of recognising the abuses that occurred at Sunnyside and the graves of those who had died as a result. Ground penetrating radar was used on the site, finding 29 graves. The discovery spurred the Heritage Council to accede to the campaign and grant the current listing; it was ultimately successful despite a hostile initial report by the relevant Department that had recommended listing only the trees.  Description  The former Sunnyside Sugar Plantation, now known simply as Sunnyside, comprises about 40.4 hectares of arable land, with some fenced areas for horses and cattle and an area comprising a house, gardens and various sheds. The dry-rubble wall runs along the north-eastern boundary with Windermere Road, while the two mature fig trees stand about to the south of the road in the north-west corner of 9/SP155824, and the burials site about to the south-east of them. Dry-rubble wall, 2009 The dry-rubble wall extends for about along the frontage of the former Sunnyside Sugar Plantation along Windermere Road. It is constructed of local surface volcanic rock, colloquially known as blue metal, collected when the land was being cleared for sugar cultivation in the 1880s. Some of the rocks show signs of spalling prior to removal from the fields. The wall is composed of larger rocks on the outside with smaller rocks piled into the cavity and used to fill the gaps between the larger ones. This process has been repeated upwards in the layers. There is no mortar used in the construction. Two mature weeping fig trees (Ficus benjamina) are also located on the property to the south-west of the wall. Planted approximately apart, they have trunks of about in diameter and their height is estimated at in 2012. They are set back approximately from the Windermere Road property boundary (to centreline of trunks) in the north-west corner of the allotment, and were planted in front of the early house on the property (removed in 1957). The heritage boundary part taking in these trees is set off from the outermost edge of the tree canopies of the trees by two metres. All other features and structures within this area are not considered to be of cultural heritage significance, including fencing, the house (a nineteenth century house relocated to the property in 1957) and its garden, the grave of Sidney Thomas Courtice and its marker, and a recent metal shed to the west of the house. Burials area, 2013 The site of 29 South Sea Islander labourer burials mapped by Bundaberg Regional Council in 2012 is located about to the south-east of the fig trees. The burials were mapped in three rows aligned approximately parallel to the lot boundaries. The northernmost row comprised 13 ground anomalies interpreted as burials. That to the south comprised 10 burials while that south again, 6 burials. A number of trees and post-and-rail fences stand within the area of the heritage boundary part that takes in these burials. These features are not considered to be of cultural heritage significance. Also identified in this area was a raised, linear ground feature believed to be part of a roadway-also known as a headland- dating from the sugar plantation era.  Heritage listing  The former Sunnyside Sugar Plantation was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 13 May 1996 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The dry-rubble boundary wall and burial site on the former Sunnyside Sugar Plantation survive as important evidence of the enormous contribution made by South Sea Islanders to the establishment of a viable sugar industry in Queensland. In particular, they remain as testament to their contribution to the development of the sugar industry in the Bundaberg region, one of the major sugar districts in the state. The wall is also important physical evidence of the manual nature of this contribution, for without the availability of indentured labour, Woongarra Scrub farmers could not have converted their lands to an activity as initially labour-intensive as sugar growing. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The boundary wall, which is approximately in length, survives as one of the more intact examples of its type in the Bundaberg district, which around the turn of the century was chequered with such structures. In this sense it is rare. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Queensland's history. The dry-rubble wall and burial site on the former Sunnyside Sugar Plantation are significant for their potential to contribute to further study and better understanding of the role of South Sea Islanders in the sugar industry and Queensland's history; and their burial practices, working conditions and health. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Although diminished in length, what survives of the dry-rubble wall is substantially intact, and provides a good example of this type of construction employed in the Bundaberg district in the late 19th century. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The South Sea Islander community of Bundaberg has indicated that this place facilitates a strong and special spiritual association with their ancestors who lived and worked on Sunnyside plantation. The dry-rubble wall, two fig trees and burial site on the former Sunnyside represent a distinctive phase of Queensland's history and may potentially be used to illustrate events which have had a profound effect on the lives of descendants of the South Sea Islanders and of their communities. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The dry- rubble wall, fig trees and burial site at Sunnyside have an important association with the exploitation of the large South Sea Islander workforce employed in the Bundaberg district in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

It gradually became the premier stronghold of the German Reich.Fran√ßois Roth, Metz annex√©e √† l‚ÄôEmpire allemand, in Fran√ßois-Yves Le Moigne, Histoire de Metz Toulouse, Privat, 1986 p.350  Construction and facilities  The Feste Schwerin is designed in the spirit of the \\"detached forts\\" concept developed by Hans Alexis von Biehler in Germany. The goal was to form a discontinuous enclosure around Metz with strong artillery batteries spaced with a range of guns. The fort was built by German engineers between 1878 and 1880.  Successive assignments  From 1890 the garrison manned by the Corps XVI, stationed at Metz and Thionville. When it was taken over by the French army in 1919, the fort was renamed Fort Decaen. It was taken in 1940 by the Germans, who occupied it 1940‚Äì1944. Fort Decaen is no longer in use.  Second World War  In early September 1944, at beginning of the Battle of Metz, and the German command integrated the defensive system set up around Metz. On September 2, 1944, Metz was declared one of the \\"Hitler fortresses\\", that must be defended to the last by German troops. The next day, September 3, 1944, the troops of General Walther Krause took position on a line from Pagny- sur-Moselle to Mondelange, passing west of Metz by Chambley-Bussi√®res, Mars- la-Tour, Jarny and Briey. After an initial withdrawal on 6 September 1944, German lines rested firmly on the Forts of Metz. On November 9, 1944, as a prelude to the Allied assault on Metz, as many as 1,299 heavy bombers, B-17s and B-24s, dumped hundreds of bombs on fortifications and strategic points in the combat zone of the United States IIIrd army. Most bombers dropped their bombs without visibility from over 20,000 feet, so the military targets were often missed. At Metz the 689 loads of bombs destined to strike the seven forts, designated as priority targets, did nothing but collateral damage.. The Fort Jeanne d'Arc was the last of the forts of Metz to surrender. Determined German resistance, bad weather and floods, inopportunity, and a general tendency to underestimate the firepower of the fortifications of Metz, helped slow the US offensive, giving the opportunity to the German Army to withdraw in good order to the Saarland. The objective of the German staff, which was to stall US troops for the longest possible time at Metz before they could reach the Siegfried Line, was largely achieved.

Canae is mentioned by the ancient writers Herodotus, Strabo, Pliny, Livy, Ptolemy, Sappho, Thucydides, and Mela.  History  According to the first- century Greek geographer Strabo, Canae was founded by Locrians coming from Cynus in eastern Greece. Canae was built on the island of Argennusa (also spelt Arginusa), beside a small promontory hill variously called Mount Cane (), Aega (Œë·º∞Œ≥·æ∂), or Argennon (·ºåœÅŒ≥ŒµŒΩŒΩŒøŒΩ).Stephanus of Byzantium, Ethnica The name Canae (ŒöŒ¨ŒΩŒ±Œπ) means \\"(city) of Mount Cane\\"; the district that included Argennusa and the neighboring two islands of Garip and Kalem was called Canaea.

He was appointed lecturer in biochemistry at Royal Holloway in 1972, professor of biochemistry in 1996, and remained there throughout his career. For his PhD he studied carotenoid formation in mutants of Phycomyces blakesleeanus, developing cell extracts for in vitro assays of enzyme activities. These cell free systems facilitated investigations on the mode of action of bleaching herbicides that inhibit carotenoid formation. Since the 1990s he has focused on the biosynthesis of carotenoids and other isoprenoids in higher plants, particularly tomato. This research led to tomato lines with elevated and altered carotenoids. His laboratory was the first to produce a GM tomato with elevated levels of Œ≤‚Äìcarotene (provitamin A). His work on the regulation of Œ≤‚Äìcarotene formation established the advantage of using a single bacterial gene, rather than multiple plant desaturases, in the modification of plants to produce lycopene. This discovery was instrumental for the development of Golden Rice, a type of genetically modified rice that can be used to alleviate vitamin A deficiency. His laboratory has also developed methods to identify and quantity genetically modified proteins in foods, the presence of mechanically recovered meat in meat products and the identification of the animal species in processed foods.

It was built by the British in 1915, and saw use during World War I. It became obsolete following the construction of Fort Campbell in 1938. History In October 1914, the British authorities made St. Paul's Bay an examination anchorage, and decided to build a battery to identify shipping on the way to the Grand Harbour, and fire warning shots to ships who were not obeying the regulations. In May 1915, two submarines were sighted off Malta outside the range of coastal artillery, hastening the need to build a battery in the north of the island. One of the gun emplacements Between 30 November and 10 December 1915, the Royal Malta Artillery removed two 6-inch QF guns from the obsolete Wolseley Battery in the south of Malta, and mounted them in a position on the eastern end of the Wardija Ridge. The site was naturally protected so no permanent fortifications were built, and the battery only consisted of two gun emplacements. The two guns were designated Wardija Battery on 31 December 1915, and fell under the command of the Western Section Royal Garrison Artillery. The battery remained in active service throughout the course of World War I. Wardija Battery became obsolete in 1938, when its role was taken over by Fort Campbell. In World War II, a gun Laying radar set was established on the site of the battery. Wardija Battery's two gun emplacements are still intact today.

Zayn al-'Abidin al-'Abidin al-'Alawi al-'Amili, or Mir Sayyid Ahmad 'Alavi 'Amili, (d. between 1644 - 1650; ) was a Safavid philosopher and theologian of the Philosophical school of isfahan. Life and education Little is known about his life. His ancestors were residents of Aleppo and his father also sojourned there for a long time. His father migrated to Safavid Iran as part of the large-scale immigration of the Shia Levantine Ulama to Iran that had been going on ever since the reign of king Ismail I (r. 1501‚Äî1524). His family sojourned in Isfahan. Sayyed Ahmad himself was born in Isfahan, and received education under the supervision of Mir Damad and Shaykh Bahai. He was counted as one of the eminent pupils of Mir Damad's school of thought. He also had a family relationship with Mir Damad as he was his son-in-law and cousin. He was familiar with Hebrew language in order to deal with the texts of the Old Testament and New Testament. Works Nearly fifty works are attributed to him in which the commentary of Qabasat (amounting up to 700 pages) is one of them. He wrote the commentary by the direct order of Mir Damad. He also has written a book by the name of \\"Izha Al Haq\\" as the earliest essay against Abu Muslim. Although Sayyed Ahmad followed the ways of his teacher, he simultaneously tried to show his dominance on other predecessors such as Farabi and Fakhr Al Din Samaki. Some other books written by him are: * Miftah Al Shefa (i.e. MiftƒÅ·∏• al-shifƒÅ º, the keys of healing) as a commentary on Avicenna's The book of healing * Masqal Al Safa (i.e. Mi·π£qal-i ·π£afƒÅ º) as a response to christian missionary * Lataef Al Qeybah (i.e. La·π≠ƒÅ ºif-i ghaybah) Death He died between 1644 and 1650.

Those descendants were Tudhaliya IV during Kurunta's reign, and Suppiluliuma II during Hartapu's reign. It is known that Suppiluliuma II, last known Great King of Hattusa and usurper from Hartapu's point of view, conquered Tarhuntassa during a military campaign. This may have brought Hartapu's reign to an end. Tarhuntassa may have been ruled by the great king of Hattusa again and collapsed together with the rest of the Hittite empire.Trevor Bryce: The World of the Neo-Hittite Kingdoms: A Political and Military History. Oxford, New York 2012, p. 29. Tarhuntassa may have survived the collapse of the Hittite empire. Possible evidence is given by a Hieroglyphic Luwian inscription from Karah√∂y√ºk in south-central Anatolia. In this an inscription dated to the (later?) 12th century BC, a certain Armanani informs about a visit of a great king named Ir-Te≈°≈°ub in the land POCULUM, at which event the great king gave control of three cities within the country of POCULUM to Armanani. It is sure that Ir-Te≈°≈°ub was a Great King, but his country is unknown. One hypothesis is that he was a Great King of Carchemish and successor of Kuzi-Te≈°≈°ub. The other hypothesis is that he may in fact have been a Great King of Tarhuntassa. This hypothesis is based on epigraphic similarities between the inscription from Karah√∂y√ºk and the inscriptions of Hartapu. This would imply that the royal line represented by Hartapu continued at least to the early Iron Age.Trevor Bryce: The World of the Neo-Hittite Kingdoms: A Political and Military History.

In 2019, a farmer near the site of T√ºrkmen-Karah√∂y√ºk discovered a stele commissioned by Hartapu to commemorate his victory over Phrygia written in Luwian Hieroglyphics. Archaeologists from the University of Chicago joined the Konya Regional Archaeological Survey Project to excavate the stele, and the excavations of the archaeological mound at the site, which is believed to be the capital of Hartapu's as yet unnamed kingdom, will continue in 2020.

Adoption Demands of the Nation, which were read by Ivan Kukuljeviƒá Sakcinski at a meeting of Grand National Assembly, were unanimously adopted in the National Home palace. Demands of the Nation were actually political program of the People's Party which had governed all Croatian counties since 1842. The session of the Grand National Assembly that was held on March 25, 1848, as a result of the Illyrian movement and social upheavals all across Europe in mid-19th century, is considered to be the beginning of the modern Croatian Parliament (Sabor). The session is important because it was for the first time in history attended by members of all social classes representing the Triune Kingdom Croatia, Dalmatia and Slavonia. In addition to members of different classes, session was attended by students of the Zagreb People's Orthodox Academy and attenders of the Roman Catholic Episcopal seminary. Demands of the Nation were actually political program of the People's Party so they were printed in the form of a leaflet with a print run of 15,000 bilingual Croatia-German copies so they could be made known to a larger number of people.

Deaccessioning is defined as the process by which a work of art or other object is permanently removed from a museum‚Äôs collection.Report from the AAMD Task Force on Deaccessioning. 2010. AAMD Policy on Deaccessioning. The Association of American Museum Directors, June 9, 2010. Retrieved from Accessed November 14th 2015. Deaccession policy The process undertaken by a museum to deaccession a work involves several steps that are usually laid out in a museum's collection management policy. The terms under which an object may be considered for removal, as well as the individuals with the authority to approve the process are outlined in the deaccession section of this article. Additionally, this section lays out the legal restrictions and ethical considerations associated with removal of the object and the types of disposal that are appropriate based on the reason for the deaccession. Decision process Each museum establishes its own method and workflow for the deaccession process according to its organizational structure. However all object deaccessioning involves the two processing steps of deaccession and disposal. The process begins with the curator creating a document called a \\"statement of justification,\\" which outlines their decision criteria and reasoning for presenting the work as a possible deaccession. In order to determine if a work should be deaccessioned from a museum's collection, a curator or registrar completes and documents a series of justification steps and then present their findings to the museum director and governing board for final approval. Deaccession criteria There are a number of reasons why deaccessioning might be considered. The following is a typical list of criteria for deaccession and disposal: * The work is no longer consistent with the mission or collecting goals of the museum. * The work is of poor quality and lacks value for exhibition or study purposes. * The physical condition of the work is so poor that restoration is not practicable or would compromise the work‚Äôs integrity or the artist‚Äôs intent. Works damaged beyond reasonable repair that are not of use for study or teaching purposes may be destroyed. * The museum is unable to care adequately for the work because of the work‚Äôs particular requirements for storage or display or its continuing need for special treatment for proper and long term conservation. * The work is being sold as part of the museum's effort to refine and improve its collections, in keeping with the collecting goals reviewed and approved by the museum's board of trustees or governing body. * The authenticity or attribution of the work is determined to be false or fraudulent and the object lacks sufficient aesthetic merit or art historical importance to warrant retention. * The work is a duplicate that has no value as part of a series. * The work may have been stolen or illegally imported in violation of applicable laws of the jurisdiction in which the museum is located or the work may be subject to other legal claims, including but not limited to repatriation under The Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) and art found to have been plundered during WWII by the Nazis. Deaccession justification steps The typical steps that need to be taken in order to justify the deaccession and disposal of the work include: * Verification of legal status: Staff verifies that the museum possesses official legal title of the work and check their records in order to ascertain if there are any restrictions that exist in the original gift, bequest, or purchase which may hinder or limit disposal options, including transfer of copyright or trademark. ** The need to establish clear and unrestricted title is important because it ensures the museum can dispose of the work the via legal sale without risk of improper title transfer.Malaro, M. and I.P. DeAngelis (2012). A Legal Primer on Managing Museum Collections. Chp. 5: The Disposal of Objects. pp.248-272. Washington D.C.: Smithsonian Institution Press. See tangible personal property. ** Donor restrictions are also uncovered at this stage of the process. Some donor restrictions determined at the gifting or bequest of the work or works may hinder the deaccession and/or the disposal process. *** For example, the museum is looking to deaccession one piece of a set that was gifted and the donor's \\"deed of gift or bequest\\" included a request that the set remain together. In this case, the museum might need to seek legal counsel and take the documents to a judge to gain release from the deed of gift or bequest restrictions. ** In the process of determining clear title, provenance research should ideally be conducted, especially if the deaccession process was instigated by a claim of illicit title, such as in the case of a Nazi looted work or stolen work of antiquity. *** See UNESCO Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property and AAM statement on the \\"Standards Regarding the Unlawful Appropriation of Objects During the Nazi Era\\" *Physical examination: A conservator conducts an assessment of the work to determine its current condition, future maintenance needs, and viable disposal options, such as possible sale or destruction. *Object evaluation: Acquiring through one or more appraisers reasonable evaluations of the work would be helpful especially if the work is to be disposed of via sale, auction, transfer or exchange for value in kind with another institution. *Director and/or governing board approval: Following an internal review by all relevant staff, all documentation is presented to the governing board and/or the CEO/museum director for final approval. The workflow and final decision on deaccession is subject to the collection policies workflow and charters for each museum. *Notification of donor and/or external stakeholders: Once the governing board and/or the CEO/museum director approves the deaccession the last step before beginning disposal is the notification of donor and external stakeholders of the deaccession. Although the museum holds clear title of the work and is not obliged by law to contact the donor of intent to deaccession, many museums contact donors or relatives out of courtesy. Museums may also confer with local community advisory groups, such as museum members, local collectors, other local museums, and volunteers about the deaccession to inform and gain community perspective on the work and its value to the collection. Disposal Disposal is defined as the transfer of ownership by the museum after a work has been deaccessioned. Following approval of deaccession from the governing board and/or the CEO/museum director, the work is disposed of and the title of ownership is completely transferred away from the museum or terminated. The method chosen is determined by the physical condition of the work, the intrinsic value or cultural value of the work and extrinsic value or monetary value of the work. With all methods of disposal, museums are charged to maintain and retain all records of the object, its deaccession and disposal. The process of disposal is completed through the following methods: *Donation of the object to another museum, library, or archive for educational purposes **This is the ideal disposal choice for museums as it assures that the object will remain accessible to the public. Museums seek out possible institutions where the object might a useful addition to the collection or is better equipped to maintain the object.Antonio Molinari - Adam and Eve, an example of a deaccessioned work: Deaccessioned in 1988 from Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and purchased by Ball State University Museum of Art, Muncie, Indiana from Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in 1989. *Exchange of the object for another object with another museum or non-profit institution **This is another viable method for assuring that the object remains accessible to the public in some way. Exchanges are made in such a way that there is relatively equal value of the items involved, not just monetarily but historically. ***Museum should be able to justify the trade, including any exceptional circumstances that would favor one party over another. This is why obtaining an appraisal of the object from more than one appraiser is a mandatory step in the deaccession process. See object evaluation above. *Educational and research programs **Often works deaccession from the collection can be reallocated into educational programs, to be used for hands-on demonstrations, school outreach programs, or testing for conservation research. In this case it is understood that the work will be subject to physical destruction over time. In this case, the work would be re- accessioned into a study or educational collection that is not as closely monitored as that of the main collection. *Physical destruction **Objects that may have deteriorated due to an inherent vice, natural disaster, vandalism, accident, or other causes as well as works that made be considered hazardous, such as those containing drugs, chemicals, explosives, or asbestos should be disposed of via physical destruction. If dealing with hazardous materials, the proper authorities should be consulted in order to determine the best method of destruction. The method of destruction will depend on the type of material and completed in such a ways as to be irreversible. This is also the best method for works that are found to be fakes or forgeries. See physical examination above. **Human remains or certain items of religious or cultural sensitivity might need to be handled in a prescribed way in order to meet legal requirements or cultural standards. See NAGPRA from more information. *Repatriation. **Repatriation is the process of returning an object to their place of origin or proper owner. This is method of disposal is used for objects found to be illicitly held by the museum, such as Nazi looted art and objects requested for return according to NAGPRA. The illicit status of an object would be determined upon claim of repatriation via NAGPRA or claim by proper owner, in the case of Nazi looted or other stolen works. In either case, clear title and provenance would be determined during the step in which the legal status is verificated. See verification of legal status above. *Return to donor. **Similar to the process of repatriation, if the work was donated to the museum and the donor or legal heir can be located at time of deaccession processing, the museum may elect to return the object to the donor. This is not the best option for museums for a few reasons. First, it removes the work from public accessibility and second, it can cause tax complications, as a deduction can be given for a portion of the work's value upon donation and the return of the work to the donor may result in an audit or at least IRS claim on the deduction value previously received.An auction at Christie's. *Private sale and public auction. **Another method of disposal that is not the best option for museums. Museums hold collections in the public trust for public access. Though the best manner in which to generate funds from disposal for future accessions and care of current collection, disposal of works via sale or auction takes the work away from public access and places it into the hands of private citizens. Deaccession and museum ethics Several professional museum associations have drafted codes of ethics governing the practice of deaccession. Two majors areas of ethical concern that are common in these codes of ethics are the prohibition of sale or transfer of collection items to museum trustees, staff, board members, or their relatives and the need to restrict the use of proceeds from any works disposed of via sale or auction.Weil, Stephen E. A Deaccession Reader. Washington, DC: American Association of Museums, 1997. The first of these ethical concerns is rather straightforward. The second has become a point of contention in recent years since museums and cities, like Detroit, have been struggling with financial shortfalls. According to the Association of Art Museum Directors: \\"Funds received from the disposal of a deaccessioned work shall not be used for operations or capital expenses. Such funds, including any earnings and appreciation thereon, may be used only for the acquisition of works in a manner consistent with the museum‚Äôs policy on the use of restricted acquisition funds.\\" This stipulation was relaxed in April 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its negative impact on museum revenues, permitting some degree of deaccession through 2022 in order to \\"support the direct care of the museum‚Äôs collection\\". According to the American Association of Museums: \\"Proceeds from the sale of nonliving collections are to be used consistent with the established standards of the museum's discipline, but in no event shall they be used for anything other than acquisition or direct care of collections.\\"Code of Ethics for Museums, AAM. Washington DC. 1994, p. 9 According to the AASLH (the American Association for State and Local History): \\"Collections shall not be deaccessioned or disposed of in order to provide financial support for institutional operations, facilities maintenance, or any reason other than the preservation or acquisition of collections.\\"A Statement of Professional Ethics, American Association for State and Local History, Nashville, Tennessee, 1992. According to the International Council of Museums: Proceeds should be applied solely to the purchase of additions to museum collections. These associations have each determined to their own degree that all proceeds from sale or auction should be restricted to the future acquisition of collection objects and/ or to the ongoing maintenance of current collection holdings. Their decision and perspective on the practice of deaccession reflects a long-term view of museum collections as items held in public trust and preserved for access, appreciation, education, and enjoyment of not only today's public but the future public. See public trust doctrine. An example of a recent controversy over deaccessioning was Northampton Museum and Art Gallery's sale of its ancient Egyptian statue of Sekhemka to an unnamed buyer despite protests from local residents and the Egyptian government. In 2014, Arts Council England deleted the museum from its accredited list. Views on deaccessioning Deaccessioning is a controversial topic and activity, with diverging opinions from artists, arts professionals and the general public. Some commentators, such as Donn Zaretsky of The Art Law Blog critique the notion of \\"the public trust\\" and argue that deaccessioning rules should probably be thrown out altogether. Others, such as Susan Taylor, director of the New Orleans Museum of Art and the AAMD's current president, believes that proceeds from the sale or funds from the deaccession can only be used to buy other works of art.

He grew up in the segregated area of Omega, Louisiana, and worked as co-director of the Council of Federated Organizations (COFO), as director of Mississippi's Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), and as one of the organizers of the Mississippi Freedom Summer of 1964. Dave Dennis worked closely with both Bob Moses and Medgar Evers as well as members of SNCC, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. Dennis' first involvement in the Civil Rights Movement was at a Woolworth sit-in organized by CORE and he went on to become a Freedom Rider in 1961. More recently Dennis has put his activism toward a new project, the Algebra Project, which is a nonprofit organization run by Bob Moses that aims to improve the mathematics education for minority children. Dennis also speaks about his experiences in the movement through an organization called Dave Dennis Connections. Early life Dave Dennis was born in 1940 on a plantation of a sharecropper in Omega, Louisiana. All he knew was a life of segregation, he says in one interview with Ebony magazine, \\"I grew up in this life where you had to stay in your place\\" (Ugwuomo). Dennis grew up extremely poor, in the Shreveport area where he lived people didn't have even the most basic utilities. He didn't know what it was like to have these basic utilities until he was nine years old. Even after Dennis' family moved to the inner city of Louisiana, black citizens including his family were \\"only able to get basic utilities by entering white territory.\\" He was the first of his family to graduate from high school. He graduated from Southern High School which was connected to Southern University where the beginnings of student protests were forming. Dennis during this time in his life wasn't interested in being a part of any protests or demonstrations, he says, \\"I didn‚Äôt have this interest in civil rights that you might think most people are born with\\". He didn't want any part of the civil rights activism, \\"Things were happening [in the country] and I was trying to run from them‚Äù. College Dave Dennis attended Dillard University in New Orleans and continued to ignore the civil rights protests until he met a young woman named Doris Castle, who supported the movement, and became involved with the movement through Castle. \\"She was handing out meeting flyers and speaking to a group of students on campus one afternoon. I thought she was cute, walked over to talk to her after her presentation and, sooner than I realized, agreed to attend a CORE demonstration,\\" he said. This was Dennis' first demonstration, and he was part of a sit-in at a Woolworth store in New Orleans. This was his first of 30 arrests in relation to the Civil Rights Movement. However, the turning point when Dennis decided to become involved in the movement was a statement said in the meeting debating whether to continue the Freedom Rides or not when someone stood up and said, \\"There is no space in this room for both God and fear.\\" He made a choice to be on that bus, to continue the ride. Dennis dropped out of school and started this new path of his life., although he eventually received his Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degrees from Dillard University and a Juris Doctor from the University of Michigan Law School. Organizations *Co-director of Council of Federated Organizations (COFO) *Mississippi director of the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) *One of the coordinators of the Mississippi Freedom Summer Important events Dennis began his activism when he became involved in a Woolworth sit-in in New Orleans during his college years. Dave Dennis was also one of the Freedom Riders to continue the original Freedom Ride from Alabama to Jackson, Mississippi in 1961. The freedom ride was the turning point in his activism. Dennis tried to establish a CORE presence in Mississippi that was previously lacking, by being active in the Delta Project and in the Jackson boycott, and also set up a Home Industry Cooperative in Ruleville which consisted of eighteen local women who made rugs, quilts, and aprons to sell to northern civil rights supporters. Dennis also spent time in Hattiesburg where he met a local woman, Mattie Bivins, whom he married. Dennis was frustrated with CORE's lack of support in Mississippi. However CORE wasn't pleased with Dennis‚Äô strategies; for one, he didn't care which organization got the credit for the successes of the movement, but they still valued Dave Dennis. Dennis wanted to establish a voter registration drive in Madison County, Mississippi, ‚ÄúFor Dennis, Madison County was the ideal location for a CORE project. Blacks there made up more than 70 percent of the county‚Äôs 33,000 inhabitants and constituted over 60 percent of Canton‚Äôs 10,000 residents‚Äù. Dennis also proposed to CORE that Canton was in close proximity to Tougaloo College which made it possible to involve college students in the voter registration drive as well. CORE finally agreed and after two years of violence from the police and threats from the Klan, they were unable to organize the black communities in Madison County. In 1964 Dennis and Moses‚Äô plan for Freedom Summer came to life. Dennis discusses the reasons for bringing in white Northerners as a means for national attention, \\"we also knew that if a black was killed that there would not be the type of attention, on the state as would be if a white was killed, or if a white was injured badly, it would bring on more attention than if a black was injured. You see there had been blacks killed and blacks beaten in Mississippi for years and although there would be some small uh, little publicity on it, the government never did really act in any type of affirmative manner in order to try to stop that type of violence against black people, and we felt that they would if in terms if that existed towards whites\\". However, during that summer a tragedy occurred as three of the Freedom Summer volunteers were killed by the Ku Klux Klan. Dennis was impacted greatly by these deaths because he had worked with these men, he was in fact supposed to be with them but couldn't because he had bronchitis. Dennis felt at fault for their deaths, \\"I feel very responsible for Chaney and them...you never get over that. I guess I will live with it until the day I die\\". Dennis gave an impassioned eulogy at James Chaney's funeral scolding the \\"living dead\\" in Mississippi and all over the country. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJm5kBS_sEM The deaths of Goodman, Schwerner, and Chaney left Dave Dennis cynical and skeptical of the methods and the cost of the Southern Freedom movement, \\"a lot of people were hurt or killed because, indirectly, Bob Moses and I would say go do this and go do that... So you don't get over that stuff. It happens. It's part of the ball game. But the thing that hurts more than anything else is the question you can't answer: it is whether or not it was worth it for the gains that you got at the time\\". Other activism *Co-organizer of a challenge to the Mississippi Democratic Party at the 1964 National Democratic Convention and also to the Louisiana Democratic Party at 1972 National Democratic Convention. *Co-Organizer of numerous sit-ins and demonstrations in New Orleans, Shreveport, and Baton Rouge in Louisiana and in Hattiesburg, Clarksdale, Canton, and Jackson in Mississippi. *Established the first African American cooperative in the south, the Ruleville Mississippi Quilting Cooperative, which was formed of 18 women from that town. After the movement After Dennis disconnected himself from Mississippi, he went to University of Michigan Law School, received a Juris Doctor degree, and eventually opened up his own law firm in Lafayette, Louisiana named David J. Dennis Law Firm. At a reunion for the anniversary of the Freedom Summer in 1989, Dave Dennis reconnected with Bob Moses who he hadn't seen since 1965 and learned of his project to teach algebra to sixth graders in inner-city schools, and Dennis became intrigued by Moses' idea. They wanted to expand the program into the black public schools of the Delta of Mississippi. They eventually expanded into Mississippi as well as Louisiana, Kentucky, and Arkansas. Today Dennis maintains the position of director and CEO of the Southern Initiative of the Algebra Project: the nonprofit organization that aims to improve minority children's mathematics education. He also speaks about his experiences in the movement and lessons he learned from those experiences. He shows people how they can be involved in their own communities and change the world, he says, in order to make a difference in the world, it doesn't take a lot, but simply looking to oneself, ‚ÄúIt [takes] looking in the mirror and saying, ‚ÄòWhat can I do?‚Äô‚Äù.

Life Jolanda Kodra was born an Italian, Iolanda Guazzoni, in 1910, in Rome, Italy, and was a niece of Enrico Guazzoni, an Italian screenwriter and film director. She was pursuing studies in a classical lyceum, when she met with Malo Kodra, originally from Gjirokast√´r, who was a student in Rome. A fitness teacher, he brought her to Albania in 1931. She soon learned Albanian and started not only to communicate well, but also to publish poetry in Albanian as well as literary criticism articles in well known magazines Hylli i Drit√´s, P√´rpjekja shqiptare, Fryma, Njeriu and Tomori on Naim Frash√´ri, Gjergj Fishta, Migjeni, and Ndre Mjeda. Kodra worked particularly on Migjeni and Mjeda, which she later translated into Italian. She was one of the first women to publish in Albania, in the company of Selfixhe Ciu and Musine Kokalari. After World War II she worked as a translator from and into Italian, as well as Russian, of, among other, writers such as Petro Marko and Sterjo Spasse. She was allowed to neither teach by the communist regime nor to go back into her home country until 1962, one year before her death. Work as a translator Kodra translated into Italian almost the complete work of Migjeni, She worked on his poetry in the version of 1957, published by Sk√´nder Luarasi, and finished them in 1962, entitled Poesie e prose. The only song missing is the Kanga e fundit. Also she omitted Migjeni's notes, as well as certain subtitles of some poetries such as that of Dityramb Nietzsche-an, Melodis√´ komb√´tare (To the national melody) and the dedications. Her translations of the 1960s are very precious, because nowadays hard to find. Kodra is very true to the original text as a translator, which was a must in those years for a translator. For this reason there is an emotional shift in Kodra's translations.

The Hampton House building, designed by George Oatley, is a Grade II listed building. History The hospital was founded as a dispensary in 1832 and became a hospital in 1852. From 1925, the hospital was based in its own building, Hampton House, in the Cotham area of Bristol. It joined the National Health Service in 1948. On 7 January 2013, the hospital moved operations from Cotham to the South Bristol Community Hospital. In-patient services had been provided at Hampton House until 1986, when they were moved to the Bristol Eye Hospital, with out-patients continuing at Hampton House. Homeopathic services ceased at the hospital in October 2015, partly in response to a 10:23 Campaign, which opposed the public funding of homeopathy, led by the Good Thinking Society and public figures such as Simon Singh and Edzard Ernst. University Hospitals Bristol confirmed to the clinical commissioning group (CCG) that it would cease to offer homeopathic therapies from October 2015, at which point homeopathic therapies would no longer be included in the contract.

Way Back Home  A Himalayan Travelogue = Episode Guide  Episode 1 ‚Äì Kullu and Manali = The journey begins ‚Äì Rohan travels from Delhi to Manali, to find his hometown covered in a blanket of snow. He explores the narrow alleyways of the bazaar eating thupka and momos, eventually making his way to the streets of Old Manali where children were sledging down the snowy slopes. An integral part of every pahadi‚Äôs life during the winter is keeping warm. Rohan discovers the process of \\"tandoor\\" making and the joys of bathing in hot Sulphur springs. He then shows us his favourite spots in and around Manali that include the local pine forest, a special picnic spot by the river and the ultimate chill spot ‚Äì \\"Jogni Falls\\". = Episode 2 ‚Äì Kullu Valley and Parvati Valley = Having spent the formative years of his life in Manali, Rohan is extremely passionate about skiing. In this episode, he travels to Solang Nala to see locals and tourists enjoying themselves in the snow, and also to have a couple of runs down the slopes himself. He travels to the mysterious village of Malana in Parvati Valley to see how the villagers celebrate the festival of \\"Phaguli\\" - the local New Year. The episode ends with a short hike up to \\"Bijli Mahadev\\", a small temple dedicated to Lord Shiva. This marks the end of the time spent in Kullu, and beginning of the real journey into the winter wonderlands of his home - Himachal. = Episode 3 ‚Äì Mandi and Kangra Valley = Rohan makes his way to the holy town of Rewalsar where the Buddhist community has come together to celebrate the birthday of the Great Master Padmasambhava. The main event of the day is the \\"Chham\\" or the \\"Devil‚Äôs Dance\\" where a group of monks adorns elaborate costumes and masks and dance in perfect synchrony with one another to depict tales of Great Buddhist Masters. He then makes his way to the ancient Kangra Fort, which lies nestled in the foothills of the Dhauladar Range. From here he travels to the quaint town of Bir where he discovers the joys of village life and the thrill of jumping off a cliff and soaring in the sky! = Episode 4 ‚Äì Kangra Valley and Chamba Valley = One of the main goals of this journey was to go off the beaten track and try and discover new places and experience new things. While travelling around Kangra, Rohan hears of a temple that remains submerged in the Maharana Pratap Sagar Lake for most of the year, and only emerges from the water during spring. He hops onto a boat to look for this hidden temple and finds a surreal sight waiting for him. He then drives deep into Chamba Valley to the remote town of Bharmour, from where he embarks on an action-packed journey to the village of Kugti ‚Äì the last village in Chamba Valley. Back in Kangra, Rohan spends a relaxing few days in McLeodganj before trekking up to Triund where he pitches his tent under the starry night. = Episode 5 ‚Äì Sangla Valley (Lower Kinnaur) = Leaving the foothills of Kangra behind, Rohan starts climbing higher towards the Sangla Valley in Kinnaur. While exploring the stone paved pathways of Kamru Village, Rohan stumbles upon a procession in which the local deity is visiting different households to bring in the New Year. It is a day filled with various rituals and ceremonies that end in a party with a lot of singing, dancing and drinking! The party never ends in Sangla Valley as the New Year celebrations are followed by the festival of Holi. Rohan marches along with a parade from village to village as they perform skits and sing and dance while gathering an audience as they move along. After five whole days of making merry, the villagers bring out their deity to culminate the celebrations and to pray for a good year. = Episode 6 ‚Äì Upper Kinnaur = In Kalpa, Rohan yet again witnesses the celebration of the New Year, but this time around things are a bit psychedelic! Bejeweled men and women dance to trippy beats as the \\"Mountain Fairies\\" watch on. From Kalpa, he drives further up the valley to the village of Nako. Everything changes along the way. The landscape flips completely from lush, green grass covered slopes to bear, brown gigantic jagged mountains. The way the people look and talk, what they eat and wear, even the religion changes as Rohan travels higher into the Himalayas. = Episode 7 ‚Äì Spiti Valley = The vast panoramic views in whitewashed Spiti give one the feeling of being a tiny, insignificant speck floating in the Universe. The majestic Kee Gompa stands proudly on top of a hillock looking out at the vast valley below. Rohan travels to the Upper Belt of Spiti to one of the highest villages ‚Äì Kibber, where he stays with a retired teacher and learns a thing or two about the harsh living conditions in the region. He then moves to a village called Dhankar where he gives high altitude organic farming with yaks a shot! = Episode 8 ‚Äì Spiti Valley = Spiti Valley sizzles with mystic magic! One can actually feel the energy pulsating in the air. Rohan spends a day at the magnificent Tabo monastery. The pyramid-like structures enclose statues and paintings, which are in almost perfect condition and give one a glimpse into the past. He is then invited to spend a special \\"ladies-day-out\\" with the women of Lari. The last stop in Spiti takes the crown for being the most spellbinding place of them all ‚Äì Langza, \\"the Home of the Gods\\". It is one of the highest villages in the world and certainly the most mesmerizing! Out here people believe in the forgotten sect of Tantric Buddhism. Rohan was fortunate enough to witness a Tantric ritual that involved communication with the supernatural entities. = Episode 9 ‚Äì Lahaul Valley = Rohan treks across the mighty Rohtang Pass to enter Lahaul where his family‚Äôs roots truly lie. He visits the village of Tholang where his grandfather was from, and is surprised to find that it is no longer a \\"village\\" but rather a collection of concrete blocks amidst potato fields. Even though Lahaul remains cut off from the rest of Himachal for almost half the year, it is probably one of the most affluent areas of the state. But most of the Lahauli‚Äôs have left the home behind in search of better opportunities. Rohan then heads out to the tiny little village of Teeling where his mother grew up. He meets two old aunts of his who take care of the family‚Äôs home and fields. Like everyone else, his family too has left Lahaul far behind in hopes of finding a brighter future. = Episode 10 ‚Äì Lahaul Valley = The grand Mahakala Puja performed at the Shashur Gompa is a treat for all the senses. Monks draped in maroon robes chant verses in Tibetan accompanied by banging cymbals and bellowing horns. Hours pass by as one sits transfixed by the sounds. In Upper Keylong, Rohan explores an ancient Lahauli home to find out how people lived in the good old days. He ends his trip in Lahual at the Khangsar Khar, a long forgotten castle that lies sadly dilapidated in the heart of the valley. As is the case with most of Lahaul, empty rooms and corridors lie lined with cobwebs and no one to look after them. = Episode 11 and 12 ‚Äì Leh and Ladakh = Rohan is in his closure mode as he recalls and reminisces his entire journey over the past few months all, he is just lost in the vastness of the Valley and takes on a bike ride across to clear his mind. He also explores the influence of religion in the valley and the why it‚Äôs become an international tourist destination. He is also intrigued by the architecture in the towns and gets inquisitive with an expert on the subject. Towards the end he also experiences a traditional Leh funeral ceremony and wonders thoughts into mortality where his purpose is sort of defined as to what he needs to do with his life and what his calling is, at this juncture the shows flashes all the memorable moments in the journey and concludes. = Episode 13 ‚Äì Behind the Scenes = The Last Episode of the Season 1 Way Back Home series gets Behind the Scenes with the cast and filmmakers.

The book's main focus is 1954-1960.Douglas, Davison M. (William and Mary School of Law). \\"Make Haste Slowly: Moderates, Conservatives, and School Desegregation in Houston.\\" The American Historical Review, 06/2000, Vol.105(3), p.961 [Peer Reviewed Journal]. Retrieved on November 15, 2015. The book's title originates from a statement from a member of the HISD board of education, who asked the district to \\"make haste slowly\\" in response to a court order stating that schools should be integrated \\"with all deliberate speed\\".Pitre, p. 513. In 2003 Benjamin H. Johnson of Southern Methodist University wrote in Texas Books in Review that \\"The battles over desegregation so vividly described by William Kellar are really the middle chapters of a still-unfinished story\\", citing magnet schools causing tension regards related to de facto segregation as well as the decline of HISD infrastructure and the decrease of HISD's tax base.Johnson, Benjamin H. (Southern Methodist University). \\"Houston's lingering departure from Jim Crow.\\" (Make Haste Slowly: Moderates, Conservatives, and School Desegregation in Houston)(Book review) Texas Books in Review, Spring, 2003, Vol.23(1), p.6(1). Available from GALE Group, Gale Document Number: GALEA207324548. Background Sources used by the author included testimonies from minutes from HISD school board meetings, newspaper archives, and oral histories.Shabazz, p. 377. Content The initial portions of the book discuss pre-World War II Houston's race relations and segregation. Chapters 4-7 discuss the debates and disputes within the HISD school board in regard to how it should handle its upcoming desegregation.Cole, p. 686. The final chapter of the book includes material about a failed secessionist movement from a predominately White community wishing to avoid desegregation, the demographic changes and white flight from HISD, and an assessment of Brown v. Board of Education.Fultz, p. 499. Thomas R. Cole of the University of Texas Medical Branch described chapters 4-7 as the \\"real contribution\\" of the book. Reception Cole concluded that the book has \\"useful comparisons\\" to school district desegregation in other Southern cities and new information regarding Houston's desegregation.Cole, p. 687. Cole criticized the \\"wobbly narrative structure\\", arguing that the author failed to \\"bring new insight\\" to the participants of Houston's school desegregation and that the book did not \\"bring the story to life\\" because the book only relied on printed sources with some oral history interviews. The book did not state whether television footage of the school board meetings existed and/or whether Keller had attempted to locate it. In addition Cole stated that Keller had provided \\"little evidence\\" for the argument that the business community had caused the peaceful desegregation, even though the claim was plausible. Michael Fultz of the University of Wisconsin-Madison wrote that the book, a \\"more or less readable account\\", presents anti-desegregation efforts \\"convincingly and depicted in their true ugly light.\\"Fultz, p. 500. Fultz stated that the book had some editorial issues: duplicate phrasing, and disparate quotes. Fultz wrote that some of Kellar's arguments were \\"somewhat plausible\\" but should have been backed up by more documentation. Merline Pitre of Texas Southern University wrote that the book is \\"well-researched and well-organized\\", and she recommended the book for undergraduate and graduate students as well as historians, including professionals and non-professionals. She added that \\"Kellar is best when he deals with the period of desegregation and not background information\\". Amilcar Shabazz of the University of Alabama wrote that the book \\"is a useful case study of Houston and school desegregation.\\"Shabazz, p. 378. He argued that the book should have included socioeconomic structure theory in regard to the business community's handling of the desegregation issue,Shabazz, p. 377. and that the book was in a \\"bind\\" by mentioning the resegregation in the Houston area schools and yet also championing the \\"success\\" of desegregation in Houston. Raymond Wolters of the University of Delaware described the book as \\"a competent but narrowly focused\\" and \\"valuable account of the school board debates and demographic trends of Houston\\".Wolters, Raymond (University of Delaware). \\"Make Haste Slowly: Moderates, Conservatives, and School Desegregation in Houston\\" (Review). Journal of American History, June, 2000, Vol.87(1), p.302(1).

Bucknall has written for multiple newspapers and outlets, including The Spectator, The Scotsman, and Country Life. Bucknall was educated at the Harrow School and the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst and served as an officer in the Coldstream Guards for 12 years. He is the grandson of Lt Gen Gerard Bucknall and younger brother of James Bucknall. After retiring Bucknall set out on a 5,500 mile journey from Venice to Istanbul via 36 islands and every island chain in the Greek Archipelago. It included 57 sea passages on 35 ferries, four landing craft, three hydrofoils, a fishing caique and a sea plane. The story of the trip became his first book, In the Dolphin's Wake. In 2012 Bucknall embarked on another trip, where he walked 1,411 miles from London to Rome following the Via Francigena, an ancient pilgrim path. The story of this journey, Like a Tramp Like a Pilgrim, was published by Bloomsbury Publishing in July 2014. In December 2014, Buckall and his former army driver Jock Davis, now a sergeant in the Metropolitan Police, walked 133 miles from Dorset to London in order to raise funds for homeless servicemen and women. A year later, they followed it up with a 335-mile walk from the Scottish borders to St Paul's Cathedral in London, following the journey made by George Monck, 1st Duke of Albemarle when he marched from Coldstream to London enabling the Restoration of King Charles II. Their 14-day walk raised ¬£28,000 for homeless veterans. Bucknall was admitted as a Freeman of the City of London in 2015.

It was built from 1879 to 1880 by J & A Overend. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  Splitters Creek railway bridge under construction The contract for the first section of the Mount Perry railway was awarded to J. & A. Overend and Company in November 1878. Progress on the railway was delayed during 1879 by construction of the bridge over Splitters Creek. The original design required screw pile foundations, but a deep bed of boulders was encountered and cast iron caissons, later filled with concrete and brickwork, had to be sunk instead. Work was further delayed by an unsuccessful attempt by the contractors to use coffer dams to aid the sinking of the piers. The bridge was completed in 1880 with the use of compressed air equipment obtained from the engineer for the Fitzroy River bridge. The contract was completed in February 1881 at an additional cost of ¬£1,461 due to the difficulties experienced in building the bridge. The railway was opened for traffic between North Bundaberg and Moolboolaman on 19 July 1881. The bridge's aging plate girders and long timber spans caused restrictions on the use of heavy engines on the line and as early as 1916, no two attached PB15 or B15 class locomotives were permitted on the bridge at the same time. By 1958 two attached locomotives were allowed on the bridge at the same time if sanctioned by the District Superintendent and only at a speed not exceeding . By 1971 two attached diesel-hydraulic locomotives were allowed on the bridge at the same time provided the train was stopped before crossing and the speed did not exceed . The last operating section of the railway, from North Bundaberg to Gin Gin including the bridge, was closed to traffic on 25 January 1993.  Description  The bridge comprises two plate girder spans with timber longitudinals and timber approach spans including spans strengthened with strut and crown, other spans by truss and tie rods. Metal girders are continuous over two spans and support cross-girders at lower flange level. These carry longitudinal timber stringers on which the rails rest.  Heritage listing  Splitters Creek Railway Bridge was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. A late 19th century timber trestle bridge, representative of a type once more widespread in Queensland, with riveted half-through continuous plate girder main spans which are the oldest extant of their type in Queensland.

He was the eldest son of Count Vela Ladr√≥n, whom he succeeded. Juan's father is last cited as count on 28 July 1174 and died shortly thereafter. Juan is first recorded as holding √Ålava in November 1174, when he was in Pamplona to witness the charter of the village of Villanueva de Araquil (Hiriberri). Although his father maintained his independence of action by dividing his allegiance between King Sancho VI of Navarre and King Alfonso VIII of Castile, Juan does not appear to have ever attended the Castilian court while he was lord of √Ålava. In 1175, Alfonso VIII invaded the Basque lands of √Ålava, Vizcaya and Guip√∫zcoa. There is no record of Juan governing √Ålava in 1178, after the arbitral decision of Henry II of England the previous year. In a treaty of 15 April 1179 Alfonso recognised the sovereignty of Navarre over √Ålava. In the same treaty Juan was granted the right to switch allegiance to the king of Castile if the king of Navarre ever tried to dispossess him of any of his lands without a trial. It is unknown in what circumstances Juan was removed from √Ålava, but before the year was out Sancho had taken over the county. Sancho divided √Ålava into several smaller tenancies. By 1181, Juan had taken up service with Alfonso of Castile. On 21 March he signed as a witness the treaty of Medina de Rioseco, which ended a war (1179‚Äì81) between Castile and Le√≥n and defined their border around the river Cea. On 12 May 1182 he was with the royal court at Toledo. There is no further record of him after that.

As far as the NHS is concerned Rutland is generally treated as part of Leicestershire. History From 1947 to 1974 NHS services in Leicestershire were managed by the Sheffield Regional Hospital Board. In 1974 the boards were abolished and replaced by regional health authorities. Leicestershire came under the Trent RHA. Regions were reorganised in 1996 and Leicestershire came under the West Midlands Regional Health Authority. From 1974 there was an area health authority covering the county. From 1982 there was one district health authority. Eight primary care trusts were established in the county in 2002: Eastern Leicester PCT, Leicester City West PCT, Leicestershire County and Rutland PCT, Charnwood & North West Leicestershire PCT, Hinckley and Bosworth PCT, Melton, Rutland & Harborough PCT, and South Leicestershire PCT. They were merged into two: Leicester City PCT and Leicestershire County and Rutland PCT in 2006. They were managed by the Leicestershire, Northamptonshire and Rutland Strategic Health Authority which was merged into NHS East Midlands in 2006. Sustainability and transformation plans In March 2016 Toby Sanders (Accountable Officer of NHS West Leicestershire Clinical Commissioning Group) was appointed the leader of the Leicester, Leicestershire and Rutland Sustainability and transformation plan footprint. The plans envisage closing all the acute beds at Leicester General Hospital. The University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust would have a net reduction of 243 acute beds. Maternity services in Leicester and Melton Mowbray will be consolidated onto one site at the Royal Infirmary. The in- patient facilities at Fielding Palmer Community Hospital in Lutterworth and Rutland Memorial Community Hospital in Oakham would close. Leicestershire is one of the areas piloting a new accountable care system which is proposed to involve two NHS trusts, three clinical commissioning groups, three local councils, the local ambulance service provider and social enterprise Derbyshire Health United. Leaders of Leicester City Council, Leicestershire County Council and Rutland County Council complained in September 2017 that plans were being concocted in secret with no public involvement or scrutiny and threatened to withdraw co-operation. Progress has been described as hesitant and secretive. A virtual 256-bed ‚Äòhospital‚Äô called Intensive Community Support has been established with staff of about 170 organised in five joint teams of district nurses, community mental health nurses, GPs and social workers focussed in keeping patients out of hospital. Each team has about 50 beds - in patients own homes. On average it supports a patient for about ten days. There are also plans to move 150,000 outpatient appointments out of hospitals into primary care settings. Setting this up was supposed to permit the closure of 65 acute beds, but in March 2018 they had not closed. the hospital trust says it is short of 105 beds. Staff at the University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust will be cut by 1500, while primary care staff will be increased by 234. The three clinical commissioning groups decided to appoint a single accountable officer and management team in December 2018 with a view to a merger. Commissioning Leicestershire Health and Wellbeing Board places stress on the importance of housing and has put a housing specialist in Leicestershire Partnership Trust‚Äôs Bradgate Unit and three housing support officers at Leicester Royal Infirmary. Blaby District Council hosts a team of technical housing and grants officers, occupational therapists and adaptations specialists which is to be extended to the whole county. The number of over-85s in the county is forecast to grow by 187% by the late 2030s. Primary care Out-of-hours services are provided in the county by Central Nottinghamshire Clinical Services and in the city by Derbyshire Health United. There are 568 GPs in Leicestershire and Rutland. Acute services University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust Mental health Leicestershire Partnership NHS Trust and Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust. Community services The Sustainability and transformation plan envisages a cut of 40%, ¬£29 million, to the NHS Continuing healthcare programme which supports more than 1300 patients in the county.

Gonzo's Quest was the first platinum game of NetEnt, a leading global supplier of online casino software and games. The game has been described as \\"a medium variance slot\\", but the paytable is rather generous. (95% RTP)  Theme  Gonzo the conquistador arrives to the Peruvian coast in a galleon. He steals a treasure map and sets off to search for Eldorado, the lost city of gold. Gonzo is a constant feature of the game, entertaining the player with his antics. The character's look and name are based on Gonzalo Pizarro, a 16th-century Spanish conquistador and the brother of the more famous Francisco, the conqueror of the Inca Empire. Considering the controversial nature of the Spanish conquest of the Americas, the theme was challenged by some as questionable.  Gameplay  The game has 3D graphics and a pastel palette. It begins with a short 3D animation video describing the setting. In the gameplay itself, there are seven different symbols in the reels: Fire, Alligator, Fish, Bird, Moon, Snake and Heath. There is also a wildcard symbol, the Question Mark. At the time of its release, the game distinguished itself among other slot games with its avalanche feature. While other games had spinning reels, the symbols in Gonzo's Quest fall into the reels. When a winning line is formed, its symbols explode and are replaced by new ones in another avalanche, which means there can be several payouts in a single spin. There are 20 different paylines. The Free Fall feature awards bonus rounds when three or more bonus icons appear. Five such icons result in the top payout.  Reception  The game has received positive reviews since its launch in 2010. Most recently, Droid Slots published a five-star review, praising the game's novelty features and large payouts while objecting to its having no mini-games. The review concludes: \\"Five years after it was released, the game doesn‚Äôt fail to entertain. The Avalanche reels, the Free Falls Feature and the multipliers are generous, the 3D video and the graphics are stunning and the overall performance of the slot is something we cannot find fault with. So, if you are on a look out for a game that will withstand the pressure of time, then Gonzo‚Äôs Quest is the one to stick with.\\" Pixies of the Forest commented: \\"This is one good looking game that knocks the spots off the competition... This design excellence extends to the soundtrack too, which is a multi-layered sonic production that really does sync up with the game‚Äôs action... It‚Äôs definitely one of the defining games of the last decade and we can guarantee you‚Äôll have a lot of fun on its reels, no matter what kind of playing style you like to adopt.\\" AllGamesNews said: \\"What you can usually count on with Net Entertainment is that you're going to not only play games that are stunning in terms of their visual effects, but also have the right combination of 3D effects and sounds that make it a full entertainment experience.\\"  Virtual Reality  NetEnt already announced that in the summer 2018 they will be releasing Virtual Reality version of Gonzo's Quest. This version of the game will enable players to experience Gonzo's Quest in 3D. Player will be able to look around in a full 360-degree view. A paytable and other necessary elements will be visible at all time, without a need to pause/leave the game. To see them players will simply need to turn their heads.

A follow-up to his 2009 film Moon, it stars Alexander Skarsg√•rd, Paul Rudd, Justin Theroux, Robert Sheehan, Noel Clarke, Florence Kasumba, and Dominic Monaghan, revolving around a mute bartender (Skarsg√•rd) searching for the love of his life (Seyneb Saleh) who has mysteriously disappeared. A third installment, a graphic novel called Madi: Once Upon A Time In The Future, will be released in 2020. It was released on Netflix on 23 February 2018 and received negative reviews, with praise for the visuals but criticism for its pacing, plot, and mishandled subject material; it drew unfavorable comparisons to Blade Runner from many critics. Plot A childhood accident leaves Leo mute and his devout Amish mother refuses surgery. As an adult in 2035, he works as a bartender at a Berlin strip club owned by Maksim and dates cocktail waitress Naadirah. She confides in her friend Luba that she has not told Leo about her past or her desperate need for money. After Stuart, a rowdy customer, sexually harasses Naadirah, Leo assaults him. Naadirah talks Leo down by telling him that she needs to keep her job. Naadirah shows up at Leo's apartment and attempts to tell him about something important. Leo shows her an elaborate bed he has been carving as a present for her. Naadirah is overcome with emotion and they have sex. Elsewhere, Maksim's mobsters meet two American surgeons, Cactus Bill and Duck, who run a black-market clinic. Bill desperately wants to leave Berlin and has pressed Maksim to provide forged documents for him and his young daughter, Josie. Duck, however, enjoys living in Berlin and runs a side business where he installs implants and performs cybernetic surgery. Stuart returns to the strip club and taunts Leo, leading to a fight and Maksim firing Leo. When he's unable to contact Naadirah, Leo asks Luba for help, but Luba refuses. An anonymous text message leads Leo to a black-market bazaar run by Stuart. Bill and Josie are there, and Bill takes Josie away as Stuart confronts Leo. Suddenly remembering that Naadirah wrote an address on his notepad a while back, Leo leaves the bazaar after using charcoal to read the imprint. Naadirah's address leads Leo to Oswald. When Leo expresses interest in a picture of Naadirah, Oswald assumes Leo works for Maksim's underling Nicky Simsek, who is skimming money from Maksim's prostitutes. Leo meets with Simsek, who is babysitting Josie. Leo befriends Josie and leaves the money from Oswald and a note incriminating Simsek in front of Maksim's henchmen. After tracking down Naadirah's address, Leo discovers Luba instead. Luba admits that he and Naadirah have been working as prostitutes to earn the money she so desperately needs. Luba also expresses anger at Naadirah having loved Leo instead of himself. Tracking down Naadirah's mother, Leo learns Naadirah is Josie's mother and realizes Bill is responsible for Naadirah's disappearance. After Bill and Duck torture Simsek on Maksim's orders, Bill discovers pictures of naked children on Duck's computer. Bill threatens to break Duck's arms if he ever touches a child, but Bill becomes elated when Maksim reports he has the forged documents ready. Bill takes Duck out on the town in celebration, offering his house to Duck. It is during this time that Duck casually reveals that he was the one who had been anonymously texting Leo, as a way to vent his frustrations with Bill. A security guard stops them for a casual theft, and Bill threatens to kill the guard. When Duck intervenes, Bill strikes him. Upset by this treatment, Duck texts Bill's destination to Leo. Leo takes a support beam from the bed he made, uses it to beat up Maksim and his henchmen, and then takes Bill's forged documents. In Bill's house, Leo finds a badly wounded Simsek and Naadirah's asphyxiated corpse in a bag, murdered by Bill. After killing Simsek, Bill attacks Leo, only to have Leo impale Bill on his own knife. Duck arrives at Bill's house, refuses to take Bill to a hospital, and instead, turns the surveillance camera installed in Josie's room towards Bill's face, so he will see what Duck will do with Josie, taunting him with the idea of his plans of the future molestation of his daughter. Duck knocks out Leo and implants an electrolarynx so he can hear Leo apologize for killing Bill. When Leo refuses, Duck takes him to the bridge in the one photo Leo has of Naadirah. Leo still refuses to apologize, takes a deep breath and throws them both into the water. Duck drowns and Leo shouts a warning to Josie not to get close to the bridge's edge. Both of them safe and sound, Leo tells Josie he will take her to her maternal grandmother. After some time has passed a healed Leo sits with Josie in a restaurant, both drawing pictures.

During the film's development, Jones had expressed his desire for Sam Rockwell to reprise his role from Moon in a cameo appearance that was to act as an epilogue for the character, and that the film would be the second installment in a trilogy consisting of Moon, Mute and yet to be announced third film. In October 2016, Justin Theroux officially joined the cast, joining Skarsg√•rd, Rudd, Noel Clarke and Florence Kasumba. Filming Filming began on September 28, 2016. The film was shot on site in Berlin by cinematographer Gary Shaw, who worked with Jones on Moon. Music Clint Mansell composed the film's score. In a series of Instagram posts titled Mute & Me, he cited the culture of 20th century Berlin as a major influence, claiming that \\"Berlin has been, and continues to be, a cultural hot bed of our times\\". Mansell drew from multiple forms of Berlin culture, including \\"poets and artists, musicians and philosophers, dreamers and drunks, lovers and the lost and lonely, the wild, the beautiful, and the damned\\". During background research for the film, Mansell claimed to have drawn inspiration from works of German expressionism such as Metropolis, the crime drama M, as well as works of classic and contemporary film noir like In A Lonely Place, Cape Fear, Chinatown, Brick, and Blood Simple. Mansell also looked at the works of New German Cinema filmmakers like Werner Herzog, Rainer Werner Fassbinder, and Wim Wenders. He points to Fassbinder's World on a Wire as a specific sci-fi influence from that era. He also looked at the krautrock group Popul Vuh and their collaborations with Herzog on Aguirre, Wrath of God, and Nosferatu the Vampyre. Mansell cited Jones' father David Bowie's Berlin Trilogy of albums as being a major influence in terms of representing Berlin culture, along with other Brian Eno-produced albums like Ultravox!. Release Originally scheduled for release in 2017, Mute was released on Netflix on 23 February 2018. Marketing The film was heavily promoted and discussed by Jones on Twitter with production stills and concept art. On 6 January 2017 three stills from the film were released, showing characters Leo, Cactus Bill, and Duck with the backdrop of a futuristic Berlin. Critical response On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 20% based on 76 reviews, with an average rating of 4.3/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Visually polished but narratively derivative and overall muddled, Mute is a would-be sci-fi epic whose title serves as an unfortunate guide to how it might be best enjoyed.\\" On Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, the film received a weighted average score of 35 out of 100, based on 24 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews.\\" ReferencesExternal links  * 2010s mystery films 2010s science fiction films British films British mystery films British science fiction films German-language Netflix original films Films about disability Male bisexuality in film Cross-dressing in film Films directed by Duncan Jones Films scored by Clint Mansell Films set in Berlin Films set in the future German films German mystery films German science fiction films English-language Netflix original films Babelsberg Studio films British neo- noir films German neo-noir films British multilingual films German multilingual films 2010s multilingual films Cyberpunk films ","title":"Mute (2018 film)"},{"id":"48553551","text":"Publix Escape to Miami in the park in 2013.

He played college football at Michigan, and was selected by the Kansas City Chiefs in the fourth round of the 2017 NFL Draft. He owns the school record for most receiving touchdowns in a game, tied with Derrick Alexander with four. His 207 receiving yards against Indiana during the 2015 season also ranks as the third-highest total in school history. Early years Chesson was born in Monrovia, Liberia, on December 29, 1993, and grew up during the First Liberian Civil War. His father, Jehu Chesson Sr., worked in the financial industry but joined Lutheran World Service as a relief worker during the war. Chesson moved with his family to neighboring C√¥te d'Ivoire at the age of two and then to St. Louis, Missouri, three years later, where his father took a job working for MasterCard. Chesson grew up in St. Louis and began playing American football in the eighth grade. He attended Ladue Horton Watkins High School where he played at the wide receiver position. He caught 53 passes for 757 yards as a senior, and he was selected as a first-team All-Missouri player. He was also the Missouri high school champion in the 300-meter hurdles in 2011. College career Chesson accepted a scholarship to play football at the University of Michigan. As a freshman in 2012, he redshirted and did not see game action. As a sophomore in 2013, he had a 33-yard touchdown on his first collegiate reception and caught 15 passes for 221 yards. As a junior in 2014, he caught 14 passes for 154 yards. Chesson also saw action on kickoff returns, and in an October 10, 2015, game against Northwestern, he returned the opening kickoff 96 yards for a touchdown. Chesson's return against Northwestern was the first kickoff returned for a touchdown by a Michigan player since Darryl Stonum accomplished the feat in 2009 against Notre Dame. On November 14, 2015, Chesson had a breakout game, catching 10 passes for 207 yards and four touchdowns against Indiana. Three of the four touchdowns were scored in the first half, and the fourth came on a fourth-down play with two seconds remaining in regulation and Michigan trailing 34 to 27. Chesson's 207 receiving yards ranks as the third highest single-game total in Michigan football history. He also tied Derrick Alexander's Michigan single-game record of four receiving touchdowns set in 1992. He was subsequently named the Co-Big Ten Offensive Player of the Week, along with Jake Rudock. Chesson and Rudock became the second-ever pair of teammates in conference history to share the Big Ten Offensive Player of the Week Award. During the 2015 season, Chesson led Michigan with 1,085 all-purpose yards and 12 touchdowns. He established new career highs with 50 receptions and 764 receiving yards and nine receiving touchdowns. He also had 166 return yards and one touchdown on four kick returns and 155 rushing yards and two touchdowns on eight carries (19.4 yards per carry). Following the 2015 season, Chesson was named to the All-Big Ten offensive first-team, and was awarded the Bo Schembechler Most Valuable Player Award, by his teammates. Professional career Chesson was drafted by the Kansas City Chiefs in the fourth round, 139th overall, in the 2017 NFL Draft.

The work lays out the most influential statement on North Korean agricultural policy and its implementation transformed the country's agriculture from a traditional into a modern one. Crop yields were increased, but some environmental problems like deforestation ensued. The Theses set out an application of Kim Il-sung's Three Revolutions Movement on agriculture. The three revolutions are: ideological, cultural and technological advancements in the agricultural field. The piece has become iconic and has been referred to in other important texts including the leaders' works. Overview The Theses laid out a framework for the first North Korean agricultural and environmental policy that was indigenous and ideological. Much of that policy has remained the same ever since. The Theses were a change of paradigm in the way North Korean agricultural policy was thought, and remains Kim's most referenced work on the subject. It is considered on of his most important work overall. Robert Winstanley-Chesters calls it a \\"rare thing among North Korean texts, a piece of acutely coherent and systematic writing and thinking\\". This makes North Korean agricultural policy \\"knowable and accessible for analytical review\\", contrary to how media and academic narratives emphasizing the \\"opacity\\" of North Korea describe it. It is one of only two writings of Kim Il-sung that is titled a \\"thesis\\", the other one being Theses on Socialist Education (1977). It is not known why Kim chose the qualifier; comparable works carry different titles. In addition to standalone publications, the work is included in various collections of Kim Il-sung's works. It has been published, in addition to Korean, in English, French, Spanish, German, Arabic, and Danish. History In August 1962, Kim Il-sung led a joint conference of local party and economic officials which convened in Changsong County, North Pyongan Province. It was out of this meeting that the Theses were conceived. The Theses were formally accepted by the eight plenum of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea on 25 February 1964. Three revolutions in agriculture According to the Theses, agricultural development was to be done by applying Kim's Three Revolutions Movement: evoking ideological, cultural and technological change. A cultural reform was the continuation of the consolidation of cooperatives into larger units that had been started earlier. The goal was to set up an \\"organic relationship\\" between state-owned industries and the cooperatives. Technological projects included the intensification of the use of chemicals and machinery. The Theses elevated agriculture in hierarchical status by putting the \\"peasantry over the urban working class, agriculture over industry and the rural over the urban\\" with the aim of eliminating the \\"distinctions between the working class and the peasantry\\". The Theses sought not only to increase agricultural production but also to socially transform the peasantry into \\"socialist farmers\\". While the working class would lead the peasants, industry and urban areas should aid them. The ultimate goal is to improve the livelihood of farmers. The Theses also emphasized education. Agricultural research should be set up and that information conveyed to farmers. Instead of practices of modern agronomy such as established soil and hybridization research, Kim Il-sung meant a Juche type education: farmers should embody the \\"creativity\\" of the masses, \\"work around shortages\\", and solve all problems independently. In reality, however, farmers were often penalized for doing things in their own way. Five key technological changed by the Theses were: the expansion of irrigation, the supply of electricity to the countryside, realignment of land to enable mechanization of agriculture, increase in the use of chemicals and fertilizers, and the reclamation of swamps and tidal lands. Impact on agricultural practices The Theses rapidly and widely transformed North Korean agriculture from what used to be a traditional economy relying on crop rotation, organic fertilizer and gravity-fed irrigation, to a modern one. A year after publication, North Korea's trade union for agricultural workers, the Farmers' Union of Korea, was reorganized along the lines of the Theses and renamed Union of Agricultural Workers of Korea. Kim had also emphasized the role of the County Cooperative Farm Management Committees. The Theses had a great impact on irrigation systems in the country. Historically, gravity-fed irrigation had been used in Korea, but the Theses called for the industrialization of that system. Consequentially, an elaborate and extensive system of pumps, consisting of 3,505 pumps in the main trunk network by 1998, was built. The span of irrigated areas was expanded some 50-fold between the 1950s and 1990s. Massive upland areas became arable. The reforms inspired by the Theses were a success. By around 1973, North Korea had sufficient rice production to meet basic needs. During the late-1980s, harvests reached record levels. Regardless of these advances, the policies inspired by the Theses were also the cause of future crises, notably erosion and forest degeneration. More tractors were constructed as stipulated by the Theses, but due to military buildup, resources were not always available. Nevertheless, since 1972, the number of tractors at 30,000 was doubled in two years time. Agriculture became more capital intensive and less labor was required. Legacy in North Korean political texts The Theses are extensively referenced in North Korean literature, and many foundational texts trace legitimacy back to it. Kim Il-sung spoke about land management often, and in addition to the Theses he authored On Strengthening Land Management, Let Us Make Effective Use of Mountains and Rivers and For the Large-scale Reclamation of Tidelands on the topic. His son and successor Kim Jong-il, too, authored works on land management, as did the current leader Kim Jong-un. The latter, as his first published work, authored On Effecting a Drastic Turn in Land Management to Meet the Requirements for Building a Thriving Socialist Nation in 2012. In 2014, Kim Jong-un extensively revisited the original Theses in his New Year's address, as well as a text entitled Let Us Bring About Innovations in Agricultural Production under the Unfurled Banner of the Socialist Rural Theses published on 7 February.

Life The daughter of William Henry Tildesley and Rebecca Fisher, she was born in Willenhall, Staffordshire and was educated in Birmingham. She trained as a teacher and spent three years teaching. She was involved in statistical work during World War I, working with Professor Karl Pearson of University College London. In 1918, she was named Crewdson Benington research student in craniometry, working under Professor Pearson. In 1920, she was named by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research to work on the human osteological collections at the Hunterian Museum at the Royal College of Surgeons. In 1923, Tildesley published Sir Thomas Browne: his skull, portraits and ancestry. The stated purpose of this document was to explore to what extent various racial characteristics and knowledge about the individual could be derived from a study of their skull. While Tildesley found that Browne's skill was typical of English males, she concluded that, in this case, there appeared to be little correlation between the characteristics of the skull and its owner's mental capacity. Also in 1923, she was named a research assistant in charge of the collections at the Hunterian Museum; she served as a curator of human osteology for the museum from 1932 to 1934. In 1939, Tildesley was named a fellow of the Royal Anthropological Institute (RAI). She served on the council for the RAI for a number of years and was vice-president from 1952 to 1955. She also served as chair of the Comit√© de Standardisation de la Technique Anthropologique. She was named a member in the Order of the British Empire for her contributions to anthropology. She died at Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire at the age of 95.

It was created on the Unity engine by AlternativaPlatform, a Russia-based game developing company. The game used the free-to-play business model, where players could download and play the game for free. However, players could also pay real-world money in the form of micro transactions to get \\"X Crystals\\". These X Crystals unlocked special cosmetic features for tanks and blueprint containers which could unlock and upgrade modules. The open beta testing started on September 15, 2016 and the full game was released on Steam on April 20, 2017. The game was shut down in early 2020. Gameplay Players control their own tank, created from a variety of turret and hull combinations, and compete against each other in a variety of maps and game modes. At the moment, Tanki X features three game modes: Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, and Capture the Flag. Players can create their own tank combination from a selection of different turrets and hulls, all unique in their strengths and weaknesses. Capture the Flag on Tanki X map \\"Area 159\\".  In-game Currency and Ranking System  For every tank destroyed or flag captured, players build up a number of XP (rank experience points) which they are rewarded, and container points. The number of experience gained is based on various factors including the number of opponents destroyed, killstreak and the amount of XP earned throughout the match. The amount of XP players gain has its own set of rewards. Players gain new ranks at particular XP milestones which publicly represent their level of skill, dedication, and time playing the game. Players can also buy X Crystals. X Crystals are a premium currency, which is bought with real-world money and unlocks special skins, graffiti, special shell colors for turret ammo, paints for tanks and containers for module blueprints. X crystals can also be earned by completing missions and entering certain promo codes.  Ranked Battles  The ranked battle system is a ranking ladder which organizes players using RP (reputation points), which are rewarded or lost at the end of a completed battle. These points place players within a certain league, depending on how much RP they have. From lowest to highest, there are 5 leagues: Training, Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Masters. Upon entering a league for the first time, the game will grant players with the paint and 5 containers for the corresponding league. Every 2 months, the league system enters a new season. At that time, the game will award players with crystals, x crystals, and league containers for the league they ended the season in. The game also reduces each player's RP by a certain amount, depending on where they are at. Reception On September 15, 2016, Tanki X began its Open Beta test.

Its role is to provide fast jet aircrew to the Operational Conversion Units for the RAF's jet attack aircraft, the Typhoon and the F-35 Lightning. No. 4 FTS has primarily provided advanced flying and more recently jet aircraft training to aircrew students, although during World War II it was called upon to take part in offensive operations, a role it took on with great success. History On , No 4 Flying Training School opened at Abu Sueir in Egypt to train pilots, primarily for squadrons based in the Middle East Between 1935 and 1936, the expansion of the RAF in line with the increasing tensions in Europe led to major changes in how the RAF delivered flying training. Civilian flying training organisations were used to provide basic flying instruction, while the Service schools focused on the more advanced training. On 1 September 1939, two days before war was declared in Europe, it moved to RAF Habbaniya, the large RAF base in Iraq, where intense flying training activities could take place in clearer skies. Because of its location, few aircrew students were sent out from the UK, and the school had to recruit from the Middle and Far East. After completing the course, pupils were sent to Abu Sueir for further training or directly to operational squadrons in theatre. In February 1940 the school was renamed No. 4 Service Flying Training School, to differentiate it from an Elementary Flying Training School. The school moved to a war footing, forming 'Y' Operational squadron to defend against air attack. The School also took on further training of Observers and air gunners, in line with requirements. By Spring 1941, other training schemes were beginning to produce sufficient pilots, and it was decided to close the school in September. However, the political situation in Iraq deteriorated, and the School was forced to fight. The Habbaniya Air Striking Force was created from the School (plus the 3 Vickers Valentia aircraft of Iraq Communications Flight) under the command of Group Captain W A B Saville.Dudgeon A rebel coup in Baghdad resulted in a British deployment in Basrah to protect Iraqi oil resources. The rebels began to gather troops and artillery south of Habbaniya airfield. The School's instructors combined with the more experienced pupils to man the aircraft and weaponise them. On 2 May 1941, the School attacked the enemy positions. The battle for Habbaniya lasted 5 days, during which the School's aircraft had flown 584 sorties, fired 100,000 rounds and dropped 45 tonnes of bombs on the enemy, finally forcing the rebel forces to retreat. Their overall contribution to the situation in Iraq led to the recapture of Baghdad by British forces, and during the emergency which lasted almost a month, 4 SFTS flew 1605 operational sorties, the majority crewed by student pilots. By June, the aircraft were redeployed elsewhere and on 1 July 1941, the School was disbanded. Second Formation On 3 February 1947, No 4 FTS reformed at Heany, near Bulawayo in what was Southern Rhodesia, using Avro Ansons, Tiger Moths and Harvards. By 1948, the School's role of training both pilots and navigators had become unworkable, and navigation training was moved to the new No. 3 Air Navigation School at Thornhill in Rhodesia, along with their Anson aircraft. In October 1949, the Air Council mandated changes to the status of cadets, and officer training became a part of the syllabus. Upon completion, those who qualified for their wings and met officer quality standards were commissioned. By November 1950 all pilot and navigator candidates were commissioned before they started their flying training as Acting Pilot Officers, and received full commissions upon gaining their wings. In October 1953, the final passing out parade took place, and the School disbanded again on 26 January 1954. Third Formation The RAF's Advanced Flying Schools operating in the early 1950s provided a step between elementary flying training and the operational conversion unit. The restructuring of flying training in the RAF led to a renumbering of AFSs, and on 1 June 1954, No. 205 AFS at Middleton St George operating Meteor jet aircraft, was renumbered as No. 4 FTS. In January 1955, the School re-equipped with the Vampire T.11 trainer. 4 FTS moved to Worksop in June 1956 and absorbed No. 211 FTS and its Meteor aircraft, which it operated alongside the Vampires for 18 months. On 9 June 1958, 4 FTS again disbanded. Fourth Formation From 1958, 4 FTS's role was carried on by No. 7 FTS on the Vampire at RAF Valley, until 15 August 1960, whereupon it was renumbered 4 FTS again. At this stage, the School took on the role of training students for Coastal and Transport Commands, using Varsity T.1s. This was short-lived, and by March 1962 this role was transferred to No. 5 FTS at Oakington. 4 FTS started to receive the new Folland Gnat T.1 on 7 November 1962, and the School was solely a Gnat unit by August 1963. Students from the Jet Provost stream came through onto the Gnat for advanced Jet training, and then proceeded onto No. 229 OCU at RAF Chivenor for air warfare training. In 1964, the School formed the Yellow Jacks aerobatic team. By 1965, this resulted in the formation of the Central Flying School's Red Arrows. In 1967, the Hunter T.7 and F.6 were brought into service, supplementing the Gnat squadrons, and were involved in the training not only of 'long-legged' pupils who found the small Gnat constrictive, but also of foreign Air Forces. The Hawk T.1, which is currently flown by the School, was first delivered in 1976. The last Gnat course graduated on 24 November 1979, and in 17 years the School had flown more than 157,000 Gnat hours and trained 1421 students. Over 17 years, the School flew 89 Gnats, and 28 were written off in accidents. The Hawk was the first jet trainer in the Air Force that was not an adaptation of a fighter aircraft. It was extremely suited for its role, being designed to replace the several different types then in service with the RAF - the Jet Provost, the Gnat and the Hunter. The Hawk was so successful that it allowed the RAF to retire the Hunter and Gnat fleets a year earlier than planned. Easy to operate and simple to maintain, the Hawk was more economical than the Gnat, as well as having increased range and the ability to spin, a vital training task. In July 1977, the School's first Hawk course started. Role and operations 208(R) Squadron Following Elementary Flying Training, fast jet students from the Royal Air Force and the Fleet Air Arm of the Royal Navy progress onto basic fast jet training on the Tucano T.1, upon which RAF students are awarded their 'wings', before being posted to 4 FTS at RAF Valley to complete the Advanced fast jet course in flying the Hawk jet trainer and learning air warfare and tactics. Upon passing the advanced course, they are streamed to one of the Operational Conversion Units, either No. 29 Squadron for the Typhoon or (from July 2019) No. 207 Squadron for the Lightning. Due to the obsolescence of the Hawk T.1 aircraft No. 208 Squadron was disbanded in April 2016. However, due to the introduction of the Lightning into service and a consequent need for greater numbers of pilots, it was announced in August 2018 that a second Hawk T.2 squadron would be formed under 4FTS at Valley. No. 25(F) Squadron will reform to assume the role of converting pilots from the Tucano to jet propulsion, with IV Squadron to focus on weapons and tactics training.

Vacuum cooling is generally used for cooling food products having a high water content and large porosities, due to its efficacy in losing water from both within and outside the products. This is the most widely used technique for rapid cooling of food product which has been proven to be one of the most efficient and economical method of cooling and storage of vegetables, fruits, flowers & more. This cooling technology not only strongly improves the product quality, but also increases the shelf life of product and at the same time it reduces the cooling costs compared to the conventional cooling method available. Principle The technology is based on the phenomenon that as the vapour pressure on a liquid reduces, its boiling point reduces. The boiling point of a liquid is defined as the temperature at which the vapour pressure of the liquid is equal to the external pressure. When the pressure above a liquid is reduced, the vapour pressure needed to induce boiling is also reduced, and the boiling point of the liquid decreases. By reducing pressure we can even boil off water at lower temperatures. This rapid evaporation of moisture from the surface and within the products due to the low surrounding pressure, absorbs the necessary latent heat for phase change from the product itself. This latent heat required for evaporation is obtained mostly from the sensible heat of the product and as a consequence of this evaporation the temperature of the product falls and the product can be cooled down to its desired storage temperature. Process An airtight chamber is maintained by removing air from the inside of the chamber using a vacuum pump. The products to be cooled are kept in that airtight chamber. As the pressure is reduced the boiling point of water reduces and water starts to evaporate, taking the heat from the product. As a consequence of this evaporation the product temperature begins to decrease. This cooling process of the products continues until it reaches the desired product temperature. For maintaining steady cooling process, it is necessary to evacuate the chamber continuously. Other factors that determine the cooling process are surface area of product, available for heat transfer and also the product sensitivity during losing water. Advantages As the product is cooled uniformly throughout the body without any temperature gradient in the body, the shelf life of the product increases. Disadvantage Sometimes excess moisture loss during the cooling process will deteriorate the product quality and therefore there is a limit to the cooling process. This problem is to be taken care of by maintaining the required pressure, temperature and time of cooling. References * H.M. Ozturk, H.K.

It lies in a valley in the Chugach Mountains near the middle of the north shore of the Turnagain Arm of Cook Inlet. It is about southeast of downtown Anchorage and about northwest of Bird, and about west-northwest of Girdwood. Description The community is located just west of Indian Creek and north of the Seward Highway within the Indian Valley. (The Seward Highway provides the only roadway access to Indian.) Although not part of the Chugach State Park, the community is entirely surrounded by the park. Although the Alaska Railroad passes through the southern edge of the community (and has a siding that runs most of the length of community) none of the railroad's regular passenger trains stop in Indian. However, there are two special event trains that operate out of the Anchorage station that turn around (reverse direction) in Indian before returning to Anchorage. These two trains include the annual Easter Train and the Holiday Train (which runs twice each day on selected Saturdays in December). Neither train allows passengers to disembark in Indian. The origin of the community (and currently one of the main attractions) is the Indian Valley Mine. The mine was established 1920 and is currently listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

B. Padmakumar. It stars Sudev Nair, Ameer Niyas and Anusree in the lead roles and features Sukanya, Geetha Vijayan and Valsala Menon in supporting roles. The film was produced by Rejimon for Kirthana Movies. The story deals with the deep and intricate emotional relationship between two men, Kiran (Sudev Nair) and Richard (Ameer Niyas). It deals with this subject in a sensitive manner, shedding light on mental attachment, rather than the sexual relationship. It won the 2014 Kerala State Film Awards for second best film and best actor (Sudev Nair). Plot The film starts with a flashback in which Richard (Ameer Niyas) and Pavithra (Anusree) are getting married in a church. It is revealed that Pavithra was an orphan living in an orphanage associated with the Roman Catholic Church. In the present, Richard is seeing Dr. Leela Iyyer (Sukanya) for marital problems. He tells Dr.Iyyer that he cannot properly have a physical relationship with his wife, Pavithra. Upon hearing this, Dr.Iyyer asks Richard to tell her exactly what happened after his marriage. After their wedding, Richard goes to his apartment in the city with his new wife. He doesn't show any interest in his new wife. One day, Pavithra asks Richard to take her to a church. When they get back from the church, Kiran (Sudev Nair) was waiting for them in the apartment. Richard is uncomfortable seeing Kiran in his apartment. In a series of flashbacks, it is revealed that Richard and Kiran met in college and Richard was able to help Kiran get his life together after he turned to drugs for his problems. They both come from well off, but troubled families. Kiran and Richard form an intricate emotional and physical bond which ends in them living together. One day, Kiran presents the idea of adopting a child to strengthen their bond. Kiran asks Richard, who is bisexual, to marry a woman and abandon her after she bears a child. The woman ends up being Pavithra. Pavithra eventually finds out about Kiran and Richard's relationship after she walks in on them having sex. The trouble Richard goes through to not hurt Pavithra or lose Kiran forms the rest of the movie.

It was designed by the Department of Public Works and built from 1896 to 1911. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 25 August 2000.  History  A provisional school had been established with the construction of the Mount Perry railway line opening on 25 September 1882 to service the educational needs of children of railway workers employed by the contractors O'Rourke & McSharry. The original school closed with the completion of the Bundaberg- Mount Perry railway line in 1884. In 1896 a local committee proposed that the Department of Public Instruction establish a school for local children of the Boolboonda area. The school opened in 1897 and in 1909 was declared a State School. It was closed for enrolments in 1973. The Mount Perry railway (originally known as the Bundaberg Railway) was built by the Queensland Government to service the Mount Perry copper mines. The construction of the railway line to Mount Perry opened up the district to large scale commerce whereby freighting of grain increased from in 1882 to in 1886 and timber from the nearby Watawa area grew from in 1883 to in 1884. With the advent of the railway, a growing number of families settled in the area, especially those associated with the maintenance of the Mount Perry railway line. It was these local families that agitated for the establishment of a school. Enrolments were received from the farming component of the community, railway workers, and also with miners associated with the exploitation of wolfram and molybdenite in the Boolboonda area. The first letter of application for the establishment of a school at Boolboonda was sent on behalf of four residents with twenty children aged between five and thirteen, all living within a ten kilometre radius of the proposed school location. The nearest school maintained by the Queensland Government was at Drummer's Creek (Dingle Dell) some eight kilometres distant. A building committee was elected on 16 May 1896, consisting of William Wormington, Peter Campbell and Henry McDade. The original proposed site was to be on ten acres of land, to the north of the Mount Perry railway line. The Department of Public Instructionapplied for the use of this land which was part of the railway reserve. The Railway Department rejected this request, and instead selected a second location on the southern side of the railway line, all being part of a forfeited mineral lease. Construction of the building took place between October 1896 and January 1897, although surveying of the proposed school reserve still had yet to be undertaken. The school was completed on 23 January 1897, and was inspected by the head teacher at Mount Perry State School. Cost of the building totalled . The school was opened as a provisional school on 22 March 1897, the first teacher appointed was Kate Ruddy, and some twenty-four children were enrolled in first year. The concept of a provisional school was developed to cope with increase in the number of new settlements and townships in the latter part of the nineteenth century. The government developed a criterion whereby a minimum of 30 children was required in an area before a school would be erected. In areas such as Boolboonda, where this criteria could not be met, the government gave financial assistance to local committees to establish provisional schools. Provisional schools were regarded as an interim measure until a state school could be built and were often hastily erected by voluntary labour using basic materials. These schools were seen as a convenient means of providing elementary education throughout the colony and soon became an integral part of the educational landscape. In 1909 the school changed in status from a Provisional to a State School, Class 10. Some two years later with the increasing number of enrolments (38 in 1911), the school committee requested that an additional verandah be constructed. The work was carried out in September for a cost of . The Boolboonda State School in the period of 1916-23 experienced a great deal of tension and conflict between some of the school committee members and the head teachers (themselves local people). An inquiry was conducted in 1922, a result of which was the transfer of a local teacher and the appointment of one from outside of the district. The average number of children who attended the Boolboonda State School varied from 16 children in 1897 to a high of 25 children in 1903, and again in 1922. Attendances climbed at the end of the 1940s and remained high until the middle of the 1950s. Numbers then averaged at around 16 until the middle of the 1960s but experienced a decline post 1966. With a declining attendance of local children of around seven in the period of 1967 -1972, the decision was taken to close the Boolboonda State School in February 1973. From 1897 until its closure in 1973 some eighteen teachers taught at the Boolboonda State School. The longest serving of these was Margaret Campbell who was teacher at Boolboonda from 1926 until 1958. After closure the Boolboonda State School grounds and building were then held in trust by local residents and used as a community meeting area until the Kolan Shire Council became trustee in the early 1980s. The land is now a Reserve for Park and Recreation with the Kolan Shire Council as Trustee of the reserve and building.  Description  The Boolboonda State School is located at Tunnel Road, Boolboonda on a large portion of land which slopes gently away from the road entry. The school building is sited well back from the road amongst a cluster mature trees, of mixed species, which create an intimate sense of enclosure around the structure. An earth closet is located to the rear of the school building further up the slope. The school building is a timber framed and weatherboard clad structure, rectangular in plan and elevated slightly above the ground on timber stumps. The roof is clad with corrugated metal sheeting and consists of a central gable and verandah skillion roofs to the front and rear of the building. Timber louvred vents punctuate both gable ends. Storm water from the roof is collected in two corrugated metal sheet water tanks located on the eastern side of the building. Entry to the school is by a set of stairs to the front northern verandah which appears to have once extended the entire width of the building. This verandah is now enclosed at the eastern end. The rear verandah is a later addition to the building and is partially enclosed at both ends creating a semi enclosed space. The balustrade to the front verandah consists of a top and middle rail while the rear verandah balustrade has a top and bottom rail with timber batten infill. Windows to the building are all double hung however vary from a six pane configuration on the eastern and western elevations to a four pane configuration on the northern and southern elevations On the western elevation a timber framed sun hood shelter a bank of three double hung windows while on the eastern face metal sunhoods are set over single double hung windows set central to the school building and verandah enclosure. Internally the school building is a single volume space with a small verandah enclosure in the north east corner. The floor is unfinished timber boarding and the walls and ceiling are lined with timber tongue-and-groove boards. The ceiling follows the gable roof form but is truncated across the apex of the roof. The outhouse to the rear of the school building is timber framed and clad with weatherboards and has a simple vertical timber batten screen to its entry. The roof is a single sheet of curved corrugated metal sheeting.  Heritage listing  The former Boolboonda State School was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 25 August 2000 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. As an intact example of a provisional school constructed at the end of the nineteenth century and with little change or modification to the building, it serves as an important reminder of the development of state education to rural communities throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The grounds include a variety of mature plantings that create a picturesque surround to the school buildings. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Boolboonda School, as with many educational institutions, forms a strong axis around which the community revolves. The Boolboonda and surrounding district residents have used the school for educational purposes, as a meeting place, for public functions and over the years has been a central gathering place for the residents of the area. The community's sense of association with the place has been strengthened by the fact that the residents of the Boolboonda area paid for the purchase of the land and former school following its closure.

The arch was originally built in 1615 as part of the Wignacourt Aqueduct, but it was destroyed between 1943 and 1944. A replica of the arch was constructed in 2015 and inaugurated on 28 April 2016. Original arch Santa Venera-facing side of the replica arch The Wignacourt Aqueduct was constructed between 1610 and 1615 to carry water from springs in Dingli and Rabat to the Maltese capital Valletta. It was named after Alof de Wignacourt, the Grand Master of the Order of St. John, who partially financed its construction. Birkirkara-facing side of the replica arch The aqueduct was carried through underground pipes or over a series of stone arches where there were depressions in the ground level. To commemorate the construction of the aqueduct, the Wignacourt Arch was constructed at an area where the aqueduct crossed the road leading from Valletta to Mdina. The Baroque archway had a large arch in the centre, and a smaller arch on either side. It was decorated with three fleurs-de-lis, a relief of Wignacourt's coat of arms, and two marble plaques with Latin inscriptions. The plaque on the side facing Santa Venera read: The plaque on the side facing Birkirkara read: Coat of arms of Alof de Wignacourt on the reconstructed arch The area around the arch remained rural until the early 20th century. A tram used to pass near the arch between 1905 and 1929. After World War II, the suburb of Fleur-de-Lys developed in the area, and it got its name from the heraldic symbols on the arch. Destruction On 18 April 1943, a Royal Air Force breakdown lorry heading to the airfield at Ta' Qali at night with no street light hit the arch and severely damaged its Santa Venera-facing fa√ßade. The central arch was dismantled by military personnel under the supervision of the Public Works Department about two months later. The arch was completely destroyed on 12 February 1944, when a Royal Army Service Corps truck hit the remaining parts of the structure. The stone remains were supposedly stored by the British but, similar to several other historic relics, they were never retrieved by the Maltese and the whereabouts are unknown. However, the arch's two marble plaques were repossessed. A roundabout with a fountain was later built on the site of the arch. Some arches of the aqueduct were demolished in order to widen the road and make way for this roundabout. Reconstruction The surviving arches of the Wignacourt Aqueduct were restored between 2004 and 2005. The chairman of the Bank of Valletta, whose headquarters is located close to the arch, promised to build a replica of the arch but initially nothing materialized. In 2012, the Fleur-de-Lys Administrative Committee and the Birkirkara Local Council announced that they were planning to rebuild the arch to the same dimensions of the original. The police force had initially objected to the project, believing it could become a traffic hazard, but of similar risk comparisons to other monumental arches and gates in Malta, such as the Portes de Bombes. The plans were eventually approved by the Malta Environment and Planning Authority in October of the same year, but they were placed on hold since a tender appeal had to be sorted out. In April 2013, the tender was awarded to Vaults Ltd instead of V&C; Contractors who had originally won the tender. The replica arch cost ‚Ç¨280,000 to build, and ‚Ç¨100,000 of these were donated by the Bank of Valletta. ‚Ç¨40,000 were taken from the Good Causes Fund, while the remaining ‚Ç¨140,000 were paid by the Birkirkara Local Council. While preparations were being made for rebuilding the arch, a dispute arose between the Birkirkara and Santa Venera Local Councils on what to call the arch. The former said that it should be called Fleur-de-Lys Gate, while the latter insisted on using the name Wignacourt Arch. In September 2013, the Santa Venera council took the Birkirkara council to court and accused it of causing \\"historical damage\\" by calling the arch with an incorrect name. The councils agreed on using the name The Wignacourt Arch known as the Fleur-de-Lys Gate in August 2014. Reconstruction of the arch began on 1 August 2014, but work stopped soon afterwards after part of the original arch's foundations was found. Reconstruction continued in January 2015, and it was complete by the end of November 2015. Some finishing touches were made in February 2016, including the installation of two marble plaques. The arch was inaugurated on 28 April 2016 by Prime Minister Joseph Muscat and mayor of Birkirkara Joanne Debono Grech. Plaque commemorating the reconstruction A plaque with the coat of arms of Birkirkara and the following inscription was installed to commemorate the reconstruction: Commemorations In 2015, the Central Bank of Malta minted a ‚Ç¨10 silver coin, and MaltaPost issued a set of two stamps to commemorate the 400th anniversary of the Wignacourt Aqueduct.

He planned and began the restoration of the Ch√¢teau de Saint-Germain-en-Laye, home of the Museum of National Antiquities. Life Moulins Cathedral 1860s. Bishop Simon Louis Marie de Dreux-Br√©z√© with priest and two laymen, probably Millet and Paul Selmersheim Eug√®ne Millet was born in Paris on 21 May 1819. He was in the class of 1837 at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts (School of Fine Arts), where he studied under Henri Labrouste and Eug√®ne Viollet-le-Duc. Millet recalled that Labrouste provided his own drawings to teach his pupils, including studies of classical Italian works and his own designs, since he did not trust the √âcole's materials and was trying to reinvent the discipline of architecture. Millet later became associated with the Gothic Revival led by Viollet-le-Duc. Millet became an assistant to Viollet-le-Duc in 1847 in the Documents service. After 1848 Millet was appointed architect for the buildings of the dioceses of Troyes and Ch√¢lons-sur-Marne. In 1853 the prefect of the Aube started a dispute with Millet over Troyes Cathedral, claiming he was neglecting the work and should be replaced. Viollet-le-Duc wrote a passionate tribute in Millet's defense, giving high praise for a quality of the work he had done at Troyes in the face of many difficulties. The tribute is remarkable in that Viollet-le-Duc was not known for modesty about his own skills. In 1857 Millet continued the project of building the Moulins Cathedral that had been started by Jean-Baptiste Lassus. Ch√¢teau de Saint-Germain-en-Laye Millet was assigned the task of restoring the Ch√¢teau de Saint-Germain-en-Laye in 1855, and was told to remove all traces of the cells that the Ministry of War had installed when it was used as a prison between 1836 and 1855. In 1857 he reported that all the partitions forming the cells and dungeons had been demolished and the rest of the chateau had been cleaned. He was given the job of restoring the ch√¢teau to hold the planned National Museum of Antiquities. He proposed two alternatives. The first was to keep the ch√¢teau with all its additions, while consolidating the parts that were in poor condition or incomplete. The second, which was approved, was to remove the additions and restore it to its state under Francis I of France. Millet worked closely with Count √âmilien de Nieuwerkerke, superintendent of the √âcole des Beaux-Arts, with the artillery officer Jean-Baptiste Verch√®re de Reffye and with Alexandre Bertrand, the first conservator of the museum. Work began in 1862 with the destruction of the West pavilion. The work progressed from the north-west angle of the ch√¢teau and advanced eastward around the building, restoring the lines of the donjon of Charles V of France that had been concealed by the additions of Louis XIV. Stones for exterior repair were cut in the grounds of the chateau. The interior was floored in oak, with walls painted with designs and decorations, and the windows were individually designed. On 7 July 1874 Millet was given responsibility for the diocesan buildings of Reims and for completing the Clermont-Ferrand Cathedral in place of Viollet-le-Duc, who had resigned. In 1875 Millet replaced Labrouste as inspector-general of diocesan buildings. He was also professor of construction at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts. Death and legacy  Eug√®ne Millet died in Cannes on 24 February 1879. He is buried in Saint Germain en Laye in a tomb designed by Viollet le Duc, who himself died later that year. His nephew, the architect Paul Selmersheim, paid tribute to Millet in a limited edition of Millet's Monographie de la restauration du ch√¢teau de Saint Germain en Laye. The monograph describes and reproduces 100 of Millet's drawings. Millet left behind 318 very detailed drawings of the planned Ch√¢teau de Saint-Germain. Auguste Lafollye took over responsibility on Millet's death, continuing until 1889. The work was finally completed in 1907 by Honor√© Daumet, who placed an inscription above the entrance saying \\"This ch√¢teau was restored from 1862 to 1906 by Eug√®ne Millet.\\" Restorations Ch√¢teau de Saint-Germain-en-Laye (from the 1892 monograph) An incomplete list of buildings with which Millet was involved: *Eglise d'Ebreuil, Allier *Clermont Ferrand (1874) *Eglise de Saint-Beno√Æt- sur-Loire *Eglises de Souvigny, Allier *Eglise Notre-Dame-des Menus; Boulogne (1860‚Äì65) *Cath√©drale de Moulins (1857) *Cath√©drale de Reims (1875‚Äì79) *Saint Pierre de Montmartre (1872) *Cath√©drale Saint-Pierre; Saint Paul, Champagne ‚Äì Ardennes *Saint Hilaire, Sa√¥ne et Loire (1851) *Eglise de Paray le Monial (1856) *Saint-Fiacre; Fontenailles *Ch√¢teau de Saint Germain en Laye, Yvelines (1859‚Äì79) *Pavillon de la Muette, Saint Germain en Laye, Yvelines (1862) *Sainte Chapelle, Saint Germain en Laye, Yvelines *Eglise de Souvigny, Allier *Eglise Paroissiale Saint-Etienne, Mareil-Marly.

However Barton is able to fire his weapon and the fleeing robber whom he recognizes as Ferguson (Bud Geary) who tosses the money he‚Äôs stolen into a water trough where it is latter collected by his crime partner, Pretty Boy Murphy (Don Costello). Red captures Ferguson, however Murphy delivers the stolen cash to the head of the gang, saloon owner, Denver Jack (Roy Barcroft). Denver Jack plans to use a photograph that he took of Ferguson robbing the bank in order to maintain control over Ferguson, less he talk and confess all to the Marshal of Laredo. Jack has maintained similar evidence on all of his men and considers Ferguson as no different. Denver Jack‚Äôs continuing threat of matches around Pretty Boy Murphy, horribly scarred from a fire, continually terrorizes the henchman, demonstrating the cold cruelty of the gang-boss. Denver contacts his lawyer, Larry Randall (Jack McClendon), who tells him that if the courier fails to identify Ferguson, the gunman must be released. Denver Jack sends Pretty Boy to work Barton over and thus frighten the courier into keeping quiet. Barton refuses to identify the gangster and Red is compelled to release Ferguson. Randall is dismayed by Denver‚Äôs methods and Larry‚Äôs fianc√©e, Judy Bowers (Peggy Stewart), becomes furious that he is working for such a bad person as Denver Jack. Judy‚Äôs father, the banker Mel Bowers () is angry as well and orders Larry to never see his daughter again. Randall wants to win Judy back and so breaks his ties with Denver Jack and recovers the stolen money, which is returned to the banks. Larry expresses his regrets for working with Jack and says that it is over. Bowers agrees to allow Larry to continue to see his daughter provided that he continues to honor his words and remain straight for six months. However, as they are talking, Bowers is gunned downed by Pretty Boy and Larry is arrested for murder. Laredo‚Äôs Dr. Allen (Wheaton Chambers) tells Red Ryder that he was present at the beginning of Randal and Bowers‚Äô conversation, and that he saw Larry kill the father. Larry is puzzled by Dr. Allen‚Äôs statement because the doctor had left before the shooting. Suddenly, he comes to the realization that Denver Jack must also be blackmailing Allen. Denver Jack approaches Larry Randal at a later time and promises that he will get Randal released from jail if he promises to continue to work for him. Randal refuses and so later, it is Dr. Allen‚Äôs testimony that results in a conviction. In the meantime, Red Ryder has become increasingly more suspicious of Denver Jack and arranges for Larry to break out of jail. He follows Randall to Allen‚Äôs office where Larry confronts the doctor who confesses that he is being blackmailed by Denver Jack. Overhearing the admission, Red bursts into the room and orders Allen to write a confession. Unfortunately, before the doctor can finish the letter, he is shot dead by Pretty Boy, who fires through a window. Denver Jack complains loudly to the locals that Red Ryder is in league with Larry Randall and works to stir up the gathering crowd against the Marshal. As the rowdy crowd closes in, Red, Larry and Little Beaver manage to get away. Later that evening, Red returns to Denver Jack‚Äôs office and discovers Jack‚Äôs blackmail material. Denver Jack and Pretty Boy Murphy capture Red and trap Little Beaver when Larry tries to escape. To protect the Indian boy, Larry allows himself to be returned to jail, now guarded over by Pretty Boy. Read starts a fire and escapes but not before forcing Pretty Boy to confess to the killings of Bowers and Allen. Red manages to stop Larry‚Äôs hanging just it time and stops Denver Jack.

(2008) The Defence Regulation 18B British Union Detainees List. Revised edition. Friends of Oswald Mosley. p. 7. In 1942, Burgess set up a distribution centre for anti-Semitic literature for the BUF in Edgware, Middlesex. According to Graham Macklin, Burgess was lucky to escape prosecution for seditious libel.Graham Macklin, Very Deeply Dyed in Black: Sir Oswald Mosley and the Resurrection of British Fascism After 1945, London: IB Tauris, 2007, p. 31 By 1944, Burgess, along with Jeffrey Hamm, had taken control of BLESMAW. The organisation had been founded as an alternative to the Royal British Legion in 1937. The League held its first meeting in Hyde Park on 4 November 1944 promoted itself as a fascist organisation that endorsed racial purity and \\"Britain for the British\\", and inspired a hostile reaction from the crowd.Stephen Dorril, Blackshirt: Sir Oswald Mosley & British Fascism, Penguin Books, 2007, p. 542 Under Hamm and Burgess, the group became active in East London, where it was involved in street violence.Barberis et al, Encyclopedia of British and Irish Political Organizations, p. 177 Burgess was ousted from the group by 1946, however, as Hamm viewed him as a rival for the leadership. Burgess then linked up with Alexander Raven Thomson in his group the Union of British Freedom, a network designed to co-ordinate the activities of several small, regional discussion groups that were sympathetic to Mosley.Macklin, p. 39 Burgess was well regarded by other Mosleyites in the immediate postwar period for his habit of delivering anti-Semitic speeches on Friday nights at Hampstead Heath although many of those in attendance were Jewish. During one such speech was allegedly attacked with a razor by members of the 43 Group.Trevor Grundy, Memoirs of a Fascist Childhood: A Boy in Mosley's Britain, London: Heinemann, 1998, p. 40 However, his olive skin also led to rumours that he was of a Romani descent. Another rumour was that his wife, Olive, had been a communist, which was true, as she had served as a member of the Communist Party of Great Britain's Hendon branch.Macklin, p. 153 As a sideline l, Burgess imported pornographic magazines from the United States, a source of mirth for some of his fellow members, but that was ultimately ended when one of his political colleagues reported Burgess to the police for what he considered an immoral practice.Macklin, p. 160 Joining the Union Movement (UM) upon its formation, he became head of the influential Kensington branch and was initially required to work alongside Hamm at the party's headquarters. However, tensions between the two men were such that Mosley was eventually forced to end the arrangement and to send Hamm to Manchester to take charge of the northern section of the party.Macklin, p. 58 In 1949, Burgess stood as a local councillor in Kensington South, London. He received 2.5% of the vote and was not elected. The UM went into decline after Mosley's decision to move to Ireland in 1951. In an attempt to arrest that trend, Burgess and his associate Derek Lesley- Jones set up the Special Propaganda Service, a group of 18 activists whose twin roles were to travel the country supplying local branches with propaganda material as well as to infiltrate Communist Party events and to cause disturbances. However, internal divisions within the UM saw that initiative abandoned, which made Burgess resign from the UM in February 1953.Macklin, p. 61  References  Further reading  *An early history of Union Movement.

Accessed through: World Register of Marine Species at: http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=152 on 2018-07-22 The family name Turridae was originally given to a very large group of several thousand sea snail species that were thought to be closely related. The family was described with about 700 genus-group taxa and an estimated 10,000 Recent and fossil species.Bouchet, P. 1990. Turrid genera and mode of development: the use and abuse of protoconch morphology.Malacologia 32:69-77 However, that original grouping was discovered to be polyphyletic. In recent years, the family Turridae has been much reduced in size, because a number of other families were created to contain the monophyletic lineages that had previously been thought to belong in the same family. The common name \\"turrids\\" is still used informally to refer to the polyphyletic group.  Distribution  Species in the family Turridae are found worldwide; most are found in the neritic zone. Shell description The shape of the shells is more or less fusiform. The whorls are elongate to broadly conical. Turrids are carnivorous, predatory gastropods. Most species have a poison gland used with the toxoglossan radula, used to prey on vertebrates and invertebrate animals (mostly polychaete worms) or in self-defense.Duda, T.F., Jr., Kohn, A.J. & Palumbi, S.R.

Some turrids have lost the radula and the poison gland. The radula, when present, has two or three teeth in a row. It lacks lateral teeth and the marginal teeth are of the wishbone or duplex type. The teeth with a duplex form are not shaped from two distinct elements but grow from a flat plate, by thickening at the edges of the teeth and elevation of the rear edge from the membrane. Female turrids lay their eggs in lens-shaped capsules.  History of the taxonomy  The family Turridae, in the older broadest sense of the group, was in the past perceived as one of the most difficult groups to study because of a large number of supra-specific described taxa,Sysoev, A.V. (1993) Appendix 2 Genus-group taxa of Recent Turridae S.L. Bulletin of the Natural History Museum of London, Zoology, 59, 163‚Äì169 which were complicated by their species diversity.Sysoev, A.V. (1991) Preliminary analysis of the relationship between turrids (Gastropoda, Toxoglossa, Turridae) with different types of radular apparatus in various Recent and fossil faunas. Ruthenica, 1, 53‚Äì66. This led to an outcry by Melvill & Standen in 1901: Although some species were relatively common, many were rare, some being known only from single specimens; this is another factor that made studying the group difficult. Turridiae was in this sense a heterogenous family that contained, more or less, all conoideans not included in the Conidae and Terebridae. Most of this was based on radula and shell characters. Taylor et al. (1993) tried to rely more on anatomical characters and moved several subfamilies from Turridae to Conidae.Taylor JD, Kantor YI, Sysoev AV (1993) Foregut anatomy, feedings mechanisms and classification of the Conoidea (= Toxoglossa)(Gastropoda). Bull Nat Hist Mus Lond (Zoology) 59: 125-170 ;2005 taxonomy According to the taxonomy of the Gastropoda by Bouchet & Rocroi, 2005, which attempted to set out a stable taxonomy, this family consisted of the following five subfamilies: * Turrinae H. Adams & A. Adams, 1853 (1838) - synonyms: Pleurotominae Gray, 1838; Lophiotominae Morrison, 1965 (n.a.) * Cochlespirinae Powell, 1942 * Crassispirinae McLean, 1971 - synonym: Belinae A. Bellardi, 1875 * Zemaciinae Sysoev, 2003 * Zonulispirinae McLean, 1971 ;2011 taxonomy The 2005 classification system for the group was greatly changed by the 2011 publication of an article revising the taxonomy of the superfamily Conoidea, Bouchet P., Kantor Yu.I., Sysoev A. & Puillandre N. (2011) A new operational classification of the Conoidea. Journal of Molluscan Studies 77: 273-308. The authors presented a new classification of the superfamily Conoidea on the genus level, based on anatomical characters but also on the molecular phylogeny as presented by Puillandre N., et al., 2008.Puillandre N., et al., 2008 \\" Starting to unravel the toxoglossan knot: molecular phylogeny of the ‚Äúturrids‚Äù (Neogastropoda: Conoidea)\\".

Guards on a steamboat were extensions of the main deck out from the boat‚Äôs main hull. Guards were originally adopted for side-wheel steamboats to protect the paddle wheels and to provide a mounting point for the outer ends of the paddle wheel shafts. The main deck planking extended out over the guards, and when a steamboat was fully loaded, and sunk deeply in the water, it often appeared that the edges of the guards marked the line of the hull. The size of the guards was governed, on a sidewheeler, by the width of the paddle-wheels and their housings. On early steamboats operating on the Mississippi and Ohio rivers the overall width of the vessel, counting the guards, did not exceed more than about one-third of the hull width. However, by the 1850s, the width of the guards in extreme cases was more than twice the width of the hull. For example, the hull of the Jacob Strader, a large vessel (905 tons) built in 1853 for the Cincinnati and Louisville Mail Line, was 27.5 feet wide, but measured over the guards the main deck was 69 feet across. While the Strader was an extreme case, it was common for guards to make the main deck 50 to 75 per cent wider than the hull. Guards were also used on sternwheelers, where, with the paddle wheel being mounted at the stern, they had no structural function on the vessel. On sternwheelers the guards gave additional room to store freight and fuel, allowed a passage between different parts of the boat, and provided a place for passengers to promenade. One problem with guards was that they could make the steamboat less stable, and with the type of boilers used on the Ohio-Mississippi boats, even a list of ten or twelve inches to one side could cause the boilers to malfunction, which, if prolonged, could result in an explosion. This was difficult to manage, especially when for example passengers would crowd along one side of a boat to observe an attraction.

The actress previously made a guest appearance in the show as Hayley Doven in 2010. She also auditioned for the role of Bianca Scott, before she was cast as Ricky in early 2013. She made her first screen appearance during the episode broadcast on 2 April 2013. In April 2016, it was announced Sveen had left Home and Away after three years to pursue new acting roles, and she made her screen exit on 7 June 2016. Ricky is portrayed as honest, fun, capable and someone with a good heart. Sveen said she shared some similarities with her character, including a passion for surfing. Ricky was introduced as the younger sister of Adam Sharpe (Martin Lynes) and a love interest for Darryl \\"Brax\\" Braxton (Steve Peacocke). Adam used Ricky to carry out a revenge scheme against Brax and his brothers. Brax and Ricky later developed a relationship, which put some pressure on Sveen as Brax's previous relationship with Charlie Buckton (Esther Anderson) had been popular with viewers. Their story arc saw Ricky wait for an incarcerated Brax, a miscarriage, a brief relationship with Nate Cooper (Kyle Pryor) and another pregnancy, which resulted in the birth of Ricky and Brax's son. Sveen won the Logie Award for Most Popular New Talent in 2014 for her portrayal of Ricky. Casting In the 30 March ‚Äì 5 April 2013 edition of TV Week, Erin Miller reported that actress Bonnie Sveen had been cast as Ricky Sharpe, a potential love interest for established character Darryl Braxton (Steve Peacocke). Sveen previously appeared in the small guest role of Hayley Doven in 2010. She later auditioned for the role of Bianca Scott, but Lisa Gormley was cast instead. Sveen told Tim Martain from The Mercury that she was \\"thrilled\\" to receive the ongoing role of Ricky. She continued, \\"I wanted Ricky more than anything I've ever auditioned for. I often think of my Nan [a huge fan of the show]. Home and Away was often on the telly at her house...and now I'm a River Girl.\\" Sveen made her first screen appearance as Ricky on 2 April 2013. Development=Characterisation In her fictional backstory, Ricky was surround by criminal activity due to her elder brother Adam Sharpe (Martin Lynes). When she was a teenager she rebelled against that world. Sveen explained that she put a lot of herself into the role, and described Ricky as \\"boisterous and fun\\", with \\"a wicked sense of humour\\". Ricky also has a fragile side and a good heart. Sveen said she was very similar to Ricky and stated, \\"We have the Huon River at home in Tasmania, so I guess I'm a bit of a 'River Girl' in real life! I have two brothers, and I grew up with a lot of male friends, so I can identify with Ricky being surrounded by all those Braxton boys.\\" Sveen also said that they both loved their surfboards and that she had noticed that Ricky had become \\"more girlie\\" than when she first appeared. As Ricky is a pro surfer, Sveen took lessons on how to surf and hold the boards the right way. She explained, \\"I was pretty hungry to spend as much time as I could in and around the water and so made sure it became a big part of my life.\\" Introduction Ricky came to Summer Bay to attend Heath Braxton's (Dan Ewing) engagement party. Ricky was a friend of the family. Peacocke commented, \\"Ricky was always the cheeky younger sister. She was always too young, but now she's grown up and looks great!\\" Ricky and Darryl Braxton (Steve Peacocke) spent the party getting reacquainted and Brax expressed his sorrow about Adam's death. Ricky and Brax later went back to his house and had a one-night stand. Peacocke said there was a spark between the characters and he believed Ricky would help take Brax back to a happier time. Sveen confirmed that Ricky was hiding a big secret, which made her cautious about starting a relationship with Brax, so she tried to keep him \\"at arm's length\\". Brax became curious about Ricky's past when he learned the police wanted to speak with her. Brax admitted that he had developed feelings for Ricky, in an attempt to get her to open up to him. Sveen commented, \\"Initially, she doesn't believe what he's telling her and is a bit terrified. She wants nothing more than to tell him what's going on, as that would simplify everything if she could be up-front.\\" It later emerged that Adam was alive and using Ricky to exact his revenge on Brax and his brothers, as he believed that they had left him for dead. When Ricky started to develop genuine feelings for Brax, she decided to end their relationship to protect him. She then visited Adam at his beach-side house, where he was recovering from the injuries he sustained in the roadside collision. Adam told Ricky that the Braxtons were \\"the scum of the earth\\" for leaving him to die, but she started to have doubts about his story as she had come to realise who the family really were. As part of the revenge scheme, Ricky used Brax's laptop to transfer a large sum of money into Connie Callahan's (Celia Ireland) bank account, in the hope that Connie would assume that Heath had sent her \\"dirty money\\" and revoke access to his daughter. The scheme helped to drive a wedge between the brothers, as Heath assumed that Brax had sent Connie the money to convince her to keep him away from his daughter. Ricky began to have regrets about the scheme and told Adam that Brax cared about him. However, Adam refused to listen and threatened to kill Brax if she did not do as she was told. Peacocke commented, \\"It's a really compromising situation. Adam is lying about this bloke she has started to fall in love with, and she's gutted because she is realising that Adam has got it all wrong.\\" With Ricky's help, Adam framed Casey Braxton (Lincoln Younes) for armed robbery leading to his arrest. Realising that they had gone too far, Ricky pleaded with Adam to stop his revenge campaign against the Braxtons. When she threatened to tell Brax the truth, Adam ordered Ricky to be held hostage alongside Tamara Kingsley (Kelly Paterniti), Casey's girlfriend. He then tried told Brax to choose which woman he wanted to save. Meanwhile, Tamara was shocked to learn that Ricky had been in on the plan from the start. Ricky convinced Tamara to trust her, before she seduced their guard and escaped. However, Tamara was too slow and the guard caught her. Ricky was also recaptured and Adam threatened to kill them both. After Brax and Kyle rescued a badly injured Tamara, Brax tried to get to Ricky before Adam could hurt her. He arranged to meet Adam at a warehouse, where he rescued Ricky. She tried to warn him that the whole thing was a trap, but Brax refused to leave her and Adam shot him. During the subsequent court case, Ricky knew there was a strong chance that she would be handed a prison sentence. Peacocke told an Inside Soap reporter that Brax realised that if he told the court that he and Ricky were in a relationship, he could avoid testifying against her. When Tamara, who was suffering with amnesia, took to the stand, she managed to recall that Ricky had tried to help her, which resulted in Ricky getting a suspended sentence. RelationshipsDarryl Braxton= Actor Steve Peacocke (pictured) played Ricky's first love interest Brax. Sveen admitted that she felt some pressure being cast as a love interest for Brax, following his popular relationship with Charlie Buckton (Esther Anderson). She said fans should accept that Ricky is \\"an entirely different character\\" that already shared history with the Braxtons. Having forgiven Ricky for her part in Adam's revenge scheme, Brax asked her to move in with him, causing a rift in the family. Ricky's initial instinct was to turn the offer down, knowing how much it would upset Casey. But she eventually changed her mind and accepted. Sveen told Gavin Scott from TV Week that Ricky was \\"still in disbelief\\" that Brax's love for her had over ridden everything that had happened. She also explained that as Ricky had known them all her life, she did not want to get in the way of Brax and Casey's relationship. Casey was displeased upon learning that Ricky was moving in, leaving her stuck in the middle as he and Brax argued. A few months later, Brax started acting out of character when the Barrett brothers turned up in the Bay. His mysterious behaviour caused concern for Ricky and she was \\"disturbed by his inability to share\\". Ricky initially suspected that Josh Barrett (Jackson Gallagher) was Brax's son, but Brax soon admitted to accidentally killing Josh's father Johnny (Stephen Anderton). Speaking to Erin Miller of TV Week, Sveen told her that Ricky was \\"devastated\\" about Brax's confession and she also worried about how Brax would go about trying to redeem himself. Ricky begged Brax to keep quiet about Johnny's death, but he went to the police. After being found guilty of manslaughter, Brax was sent to prison for fifteen years. During their first visitation, Ricky was forced to consider how long they would be parted for. Sveen commented that Ricky was \\"heartbroken\\" as they were going to spend the rest of their lives together, and it was suddenly taken away from them. After Brax was led back to his cell, Ricky broke down in tears. Shortly after another prison visit, Ricky fainted. She turned to Nate Cooper (Kyle Pryor) for help and he suggested that she might be pregnant. Ricky took a pregnancy which came back positive. Kyle offered her his support and agreed not to tell his brothers when she asked. Of the development, Sveen stated \\"Ricky is so torn every way she turns and has no idea what to do. The strange thing about this is, despite Ricky being so maternal and protective of the people around her, she never thought she would become a mother. She just never considered it would be an option for her.\\" Sveen noted that while Ricky was conflicted, a baby would make the connection between Ricky and Brax stronger. Before Ricky could tell Brax about the pregnancy, he ended their relationship. Sveen called the scenes \\"taxing\\" and told Tvnz.co.nz that filming the story had \\"really hurt\\". Ricky later miscarried the baby. After learning that Adam was present when Johnny was killed, Ricky and Casey visited him in prison and learned he was actually responsible. They persuaded Adam to confess to Johnny's murder and Brax was freed. He was initially hopeful that he and Ricky would reunite, but he then learned that she dating Nate. While Brax respected Nate, he made it clear to him that he wanted Ricky back. When Ricky went to London for a job, Brax followed her and declared his love for her. Ricky rejected him, but he refused to give up and later crashed her photography assignment. Sveen told Rebecca Lake of TV Week that while Ricky thought Brax's gesture in London was romantic, he also sabotaged the biggest opportunity of her life. After Brax was rushed to the hospital with a blood clot, Ricky remained by his side and she contemplated giving their relationship a second chance. Ricky and Brax later had sex, which left Ricky questioning whether she had made a mistake. However, with some good advice from Hannah Wilson (Cassie Howarth), Ricky and Brax reunited. In 2015, Peacocke announced his departure from Home and Away. Brax's exit storyline saw him sent to prison for a murder he did not commit. Brax organised an escape plan during a prison transfer, but the car he was travelling in was run off the road into a river instead. To protect Ricky and his newborn son, Brax let everyone believe he was dead, except his best friend Ash (George Mason). Sveen told Kerry Harvey from Stuff.co.nz that she thought Brax's decision was \\"annoying\\", as she knew Ricky would have wanted to go with him. Sveen also spoke of Ricky's struggle with grief: \\"Brax has been a lifetime partner for her. She sort of grew up with him, had a bit of a crush on him. He's been her best friend and a sort of father figure to the people around her as well.\\" Sveen added that it would be \\"disturbing\\" to see Brax reappear in the Bay again, but believed that Ricky would want him to help her raise their son. =Nate Cooper= Nate supported Ricky through her miscarriage and when she got caught up in a bomb explosion at the hospital. Having accepted that her relationship with Brax was over for good, Ricky decided to move on with Nate. Sveen explained that Nate appealed to Ricky as he did not have baggage, and he was not dangerous or complicated. He also believed in Ricky and wanted to see her achieve her dreams. Ricky was \\"braced for disapproval\\" from the Braxtons and she was not looking forward to the repercussions, but Sveen said she would not let herself be defined by other people's opinions. Sveen also said that Ricky had not stopped loving Brax, but it was easier to forget about him with the distance. During a Yahoo7 feature on Ricky's love triangle, Sveen admitted that she felt \\"very challenged\\" by the scripts for her character's new romance with Nate. She explained \\"I think it now will be very interesting to see how they take Ricky now as an independent character away from the Braxtons. She embarks on what feels like a crazy decision to go with Nate, at a time that feels far too soon.\\" Sveen thought Nate had opened up a new world for Ricky and he was allowing her a chance to reinvent herself, as well as reigniting her passion for photography. When Brax returned to the Bay, Nate asked him to stay away from Ricky. She saw his actions as \\"condescending\\" and became frustrated at his interference. Ricky eventually told Nate to leave her alone and he worried that he had lost her for good. When Ricky learned that Nate had secured her a photography job in London, she immediately sought out Brax to tell him the news first. On her return from London, Ricky came to the conclusion that she did not want to be with either Brax or Nate. Nate later arranged for them to meet at Angelo's, where he declared his love for Ricky and told her he wanted to make her happy. However, Ricky eventually reunited with Brax. Sveen later commented that Ricky's relationship with Nate had been a welcome distraction from the pain of her miscarriage. Motherhood In late April 2014, Sveen started filming scenes for a pregnancy storyline. Ricky was \\"over the moon\\" when she learned she was pregnant with Brax's child. However, before she could tell him, she learned that Casey had been shot and killed. Ricky felt unable to tell Brax the news and she confided in Phoebe Nicholson (Isabella Giovinazzo), who urged her to be happy about the development before she worries about anyone else. In order to portray Ricky's pregnancy, Sveen was required to wear a prosthetic pregnancy suit for several months. The suit represented five different stages of the baby's growth. The storyline was played out over eight to nine months in real time, and Sveen commented that it felt \\"like the world's longest pregnancy. It's gone on for about a year since the time we started shooting.\\" Sveen carried out research at the Royal Hospital for Women and spoke to a midwife about how Ricky's behaviour would be affected by the various stages of pregnancy. Sveen said the pregnancy was one of her more memorable and fun storylines as an actor. Sveen filmed the birth scenes in late 2014. Ricky went into labour at home alone, forcing her to attract her neighbour John Palmer's (Shane Withington) attention. Sveen said that Ricky was \\"very scared\\" when she went into labour, as she did not think she would be doing it alone. She also said that Ricky was terrified without Brax and added, \\"she needs to manage everything and she doesn't like to lose that sense of control ‚Äì she's been a bit of a matriarch and she finds it difficult to lean on other people.\\" On the way to the hospital, John suffered a flat tyre, but they eventually made it to the ward. Kyle remained by Ricky's side as she gave birth to a son. Sveen told an Inside Soap writer, \\"It's an incredible moment for Ricky when she holds her son for the first time. She finally feels free of all the fear and anxiety. Her baby is her future now.\\" The actress added that despite the circumstances of the birth, Ricky would be a strong, but loving mother. A week after giving birth, Ricky introduced the baby to Brax for the first time. Sveen explained that Ricky was excited by the event and tried to remain upbeat during the meeting, knowing that Brax would have to go back to a lonely prison cell at the end. Ricky and Brax agreed to name their son Casey, after his late uncle. Following the visit, Ricky broke down and Sveen explained, \\"She doesn't feel the need to hide her sadness once she's out of Brax's sight. Ricky's able to drop the facade and let her feelings flood out. She's lonely and struggling, and feels a bit hopeless.\\" A few weeks later, Ricky was told that Brax had died and she struggled to stop Casey from crying. Sveen thought the baby was picking up on Ricky's anxiety. Ricky also found it hard to look at Casey as he reminded her of Brax. When Marilyn Chambers (Emily Symons) offered to look after Casey for the evening, Ricky took the opportunity to skip town to grieve for Brax on her own. Sveen added that Ricky \\"cares for Casey deeply\\", but she was just in a dark place. Marriage to Nate and Brax's return Ricky eventually reconciled with Nate Cooper, and Sveen said Ricky was the \\"happiest she's been in a long time\\". At Zac MacGuire (Charlie Clausen) and Leah Patterson-Baker's (Ada Nicodemou) wedding reception, Nate proposes to Ricky. Sveen described the moment as \\"a fairy-tale proposal\\" and Ricky immediately says yes. However, shortly afterwards, she learned from Ash and Phoebe that Brax was still alive. Ricky went into shock and then realised that she was angry with Brax, who let her believe he was dead for six months. Sveen said, \\"Ricky finally has everything she wants in her life and then this news makes her perfect world explode.\\" Nate did not take the news well and Ricky had to reassure him that it did not change anything between them. However, Nate chose to end their engagement, so she could deal with Brax. When asked if Ricky was still in love with Brax, Sveen replied that a part of her always would be, but learning that he was not dead just reaffirmed her love for Nate. In the show's first two-hander episode, Ricky came face-to-face with Brax. He emerged from the bathroom, leaving Ricky \\"in absolute shock\\". He tried to explain his reasons for faking his own death and leaving her and Casey behind. Of Ricky's reaction, Sveen commented \\"Ricky isn't having a bar of it. She believes that Brax should have let her in on his plan. She can't understand why he wouldn't trust her with this secret, rather than someone like Ash.\\" Brax asked for Ricky's forgiveness, but she made it clear to him that she was with Nate. Despite this, Brax tried to kiss her. Sveen explained that Ricky pulls away from the kiss and walks away, as she believes Nate is the right man for her. Brax begged Ricky to go on the run with him, but she refused and he left after being reunited with Casey. Sveen enjoyed filming the episode, saying it was good to work with Peacocke again. Departure On 5 April 2016, it was confirmed that Sveen would be leaving Home and Away as she had been cast in upcoming drama The Secret Daughter. Sveen thanked the cast, crew and viewers on her social media account following the announcement. She stated \\"Playing Ricky has shaped me forever. I carry every bond that was forged and so many fond memories, into the new beginning.\\" Ricky departed on 7 June 2016, after reuniting with Brax. Storylines Ricky comes to Summer Bay for Heath Braxton and Bianca Scott's engagement party. She is reunited with her former crush Darryl Braxton and they have a one-night stand. They continue to meet up, but Ricky always disappears afterwards claiming that she has to work. Brax learns the police are looking for Ricky and she tells him that she has been dealing with her late brother, Adam's estate. Ricky accesses Brax's business account and transfers $100,000 to Connie Callahan, the grandmother of Heath's daughter. When Kyle Braxton notices the missing money, Ricky tells him Brax is having money troubles. When Brax declares his love for her, Ricky rejects him. She then meets up with Adam, and it emerges that he is using her to get revenge on the Braxtons. Ricky pays Kyle to collect a package, which contains a gun, and plants it in Casey's Braxton's flat. Ricky tries to convince her brother to abandon his revenge plan, but he refuses. He then frames Casey for armed robbery. When Ricky threatens to tell Brax about the revenge plan, Adam takes her hostage alongside Tamara Kingsley. Ricky flirts with their guard and manages to overpower him and escape. However, she runs into Adam who takes her and Tamara to a warehouse. Ricky persuades Adam to release Tamara. Brax finds Ricky and frees her, before Adam shoots him. At the hospital, Ricky tells the police the truth about Adam's plan and her part in it. She tells Brax that she loves him and he later asks her to move in with him. At Ricky's trial, Brax refuses to testify, while Tamara remembers that Ricky tried to help her. Ricky is given a two-year suspended sentence. When Brax invites Josh Barrett to stay with them, Ricky initially believes that Brax is the boy's father. Brax explains that Josh's father, Johnny, had hit Casey and Brax pushed him away causing him to hit his head and die. Ricky asks Brax not to tell anyone, but he confesses to the police and is arrested. Brax is sent to prison for fifteen years, while Ricky agrees to support Josh. Ricky argues with Kyle when she learns that he warned her friend Nate Cooper away from her. Ricky faints after visiting Brax in prison and Nate suspects she is pregnant, which is confirmed by a pregnancy test. The rest of the family find out, but before Ricky can tell Brax, he breaks up with her. When she starts bleeding, Ricky believes she is losing the baby. At the hospital, she is given the all-clear, but she is then caught up in a bomb explosion. Ricky suffers minor injuries, but later miscarries the baby. Ricky spends time with Nate and kisses him. After Heath tells her not to wait for Brax, she moves out and begins dating Nate. Adam contacts Ricky and she agrees to meet him, along with Casey. Adam admits that he actually killed Johnny and Brax is released, just as Ricky is offered a photography assignment in London. When she learns Nate warned Brax to stay away from her, she tells them both that she is going to London and might not come back. Ricky invites Bianca to come with her, while Brax, Heath and Casey follow them there. Brax pleads with Ricky to give him a second chance, but she rejects him. Bianca and Heath later tell Ricky that Brax has been struck by a car . On her return home, Ricky breaks up with Nate. He tells her he loves her, but she has sex with Brax. She also tells him about the miscarriage and they get back together. Ricky is hurt when Nate introduces her to his estranged wife, Sophie Taylor (Bridgette Sneddon). Ricky tells Brax she wants a baby with him, but he replies that he does not want a child, as he is worried about turning into his father. He later changes his mind and Ricky discovers she is pregnant on the day Casey is killed by Jake Pirovic (Fletcher Humphrys). Ricky initially keeps the news from Brax, but tells him in a bid to halt his revenge campaign against Jake. Martin \\"Ash\\" Ashford turns up looking for Brax and he tells Ricky that he a friend from prison. Ricky grows uncomfortable with Brax and Ash's friendship, especially when Brax misses an ultrasound appointment to help Ash. At their rescheduled appointment, they learn they are expecting a boy.

Ricky goes into labour at home and John Palmer drives her to the hospital. She gives birth to her son with Kyle, Ash and Denny by her side. When Ricky takes the baby to see Brax for the first time, they agree to name him Casey. Ricky worries when she cannot get Casey to stop crying, while it appears everyone else can. Nate suggests that Casey is picking up on her fear and tension. Kyle informs Ricky of Brax's plan to break out of jail and decided to join him on the run. However, Kat breaks the news that Brax is presumed dead, after the car transferring him to a new prison had been run off the road into a river. Ricky accepts Brax's death and holds a small memorial for him. She later leaves Casey with Marilyn Chambers, while she goes away to grieve. On her return, Ricky holds a naming ceremony for Casey.

Wheat was an important early crop for the Whanganui District: by 1848, thanks to the influence of missionaries Richard Taylor and Father Jean Lampila, an estimated was being grown by MƒÅori along the Whanganui River. With funds from the government, local MƒÅori, and Governor George Grey, several water-driven flour mills were built in the 1850s. The mill at Matahiwi was named KƒÅwana Kerei in honour of Governor Grey, who had donated the millstones as a personal gift to the NgƒÅ Poutama people. It was built by local MƒÅori and millwright Peter McWilliam using of totara logs, salvaged from the bottom of the river by 100 volunteers. The millstones from Melbourne and the cast-iron machinery and brass bearings from Britain were carried upstream by a fleet of 32 canoes. Over 200 workmen were needed to transport the millstones and machinery to the mill site, and they celebrated afterwards with a 'monster picnic' lasting several days. Unlike many of the other MƒÅori-owned mills, which only operated briefly, the Kawana mill ground flour for over 50 years. It was run until shortly before it closed by the PƒÅkehƒÅ miller Richard (\\"William\\") Pestell, appointed by the New Zealand Government. Pestell had married into the MƒÅori family of TemƒÅ Panitua and was known to them as Wiremu Petara. Upon his retirement, his second son Richard continued running the mill until it closed in 1913. The building was gradually dismantled, only the machinery, wheel, and millstones surviving. In the 1930s its roofing iron was repurposed for the Matahiwi School. A two-room cottage belonging to Pestell also survived. The mill was rebuilt in the late 1970s to a design by architect Chris Cochran, the cottage was moved to its present site and restored, and both reopened to the public in October 1980.

At the airport on 11 January, immigration officials offloaded her from the flight,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Greenpeace-activist-offloaded- from-Delhi-London-flight/articleshow/45846371.cms but no reason was given to her for this act.https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jan/12/greenpeace-india- campaigner-prevented-from-travelling-to-the-uk Pillai wrote twice to the Secretary, Ministry of Home Affairs wishing to know the legal basis for the offloading,http://www.outlookindia.com/newsarticle/greenpeace-campaigner- stopped-from-boarding-london-flight/876795 but received no reply. She then took the matter to Delhi High Court, with her lawyer Indira Jaising arguing that there had been a \\"simultaneous violation of the right to free speech, right to freedom of association and personal liberty of movement.\\" http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/speaking-for-tribal- rights-not-anti-national-pillai-to-hc/ In a leaked report from June 2014, Greenpeace was accused of mounting protests that had brought down India's GDP by 2-3%. http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/ib-report-to-pmo- greenpeace-is-a-threat-to-national-economic-security/ In September 2014, a British greenpeace activist was deported from India despite having a valid visa. https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/sep/22/greenpeace-worker- refused-entry-india The Government's Justification The Ministry of Home Affairs was given a week to respond, but sought several extensions. Eventually, the Ministry filed an affidavit stating that the action was based on a look-out circular issued the day before her flight, at the request of the Intelligence Bureau.http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Was-IB-empowered- to-offload-green-activist-Priya-Pillai/articleshow/45903892.cms The reason given was that Pillai \\"would project the image of Indian Government 'negatively' at the international level.\\" The government claimed that \\"in- person testimony of local activists\\" dealing with sensitive subjects such as \\"religious freedom, tribal people, indigenous people, violence against women, human trafficking and dalit rights\\" damaged the country's reputation. This was particularly problematic since India was at least two decades behind the west in the energy sector. A \\"negative image\\" of India would \\"whittle down foreign direct investments‚Äù, and it was claimed that she was involved in \\"anti- national activities\\". At the same time, since the LOC is a \\"secret\\" document, it could not be shown to her. At one point, the Assistant Attorney General Sanjay Jain told the court: :If there is an undertaking that she will not make this speech before the MPs, then the LOC will be withdrawn. There is no general curtailment of her movement.http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/hc-asks-why- greenpeace-pillai-stopped-govt-says-doodh-mein-makkhi/ To this remark, Pillai said that she refused to :accept any such gag offer. I was exercising my fundamental right... If I accept that the government has a right to dictate what I can and can‚Äôt say, then India and all Indians would lose something priceless ‚Äì our absolute right to free speech. I cannot and will not accept that. Justice Shakdher wanted to know why the government had singled out an individual citizen. \\"The Indian state is not powerless. You have a plethora of trained diplomats doing a commendable job of protecting national interests. I don‚Äôt see how the state cannot meet the challenge posed,\\" Judgment In February, the Delhi High court expunged the ban on travel for Pillai, In his judgement, justice Rajiv Shakdher observed: :The point in issue is, why must the State interfere with the freedom of an individual, as long as the individual concerned operates within the ambit of laws framed by the legislature. :The core aspect of democracy is the freedom of an individual... The individual should be able to order his or her life any way he or she pleases, as long as it is not violative of the law... Amongst the varied freedoms conferred on an individual (i.e., the citizen), is the right of free speech and expression, which necessarily includes the right to criticise and dissent. Criticism, by an individual, may not be palatable; even so, it cannot be muzzled. : Many civil right activists believe that they have the right, as citizens, to bring to the notice of the State the incongruity in the developmental policies of the State. The State may not accept the views of the civil right activists, but that by itself, cannot be a good enough reason to do away with dissent. :Therefore... there was no basis for the respondents to issue an LOC qua the petitioner. That being so, the decision taken to detain the petitioner at the airport on 11.01.2015, in my opinion, was illegal being violative of the Ms Pillai's right under Article 21 and 19(1)(a) of the Constitution. While the judgment states that the process by which Look-Out Circulars (LOC) are issued is not \\"enacted law\\", it did not strike it down. Media Speculation on reasons What was surprising about the incident that it was issued despite many earlier instances where the courts had clearly stated that the right to issue LOC must be exercised with caution. In 2010, Justice S Muralidhar of the Delhi high court stated that \\"The power to suspend, even temporarily, a passport of a citizen, the power to issue an LOC, the power to offload a passenger and prevent him or her from travelling are all extraordinary powers, vested in the criminal law enforcement agencies by the statutory law. These are powers that are required under the law, to be exercised with caution and only by the authorities who are empowered by law to do so and then again only for valid reasons.\\" Thus, there was much media discussion regarding the motives for the action. It was seen as a continuation of harassment to activists involved in the Mahan Coal area. Accusation of totalitarian tendencies However, a broader issue was whether India was moving towards more restrictive views on personal liberty and freedom of speech, as in totalitarian regimes such as China. Former Attorney General Indira Jaysing said that \\"The government, it seems is misreading the mandate in the Lok Sabha as being a mandate to crush dissent.\\" An editorial in the Statesman callied it \\"another attempt at Fascist-authoritarianism\\". A columnist in Firstpost saw a broader tendency: :Unfortunately, it‚Äôs not a benign mistake by the intelligence officials or the home ministry, but the reflection of a tendency of authoritarianism. There are already reports that the government is getting ready to crack down on several civil society organisations and reportedly, there is even a \\"hit-list\\". It‚Äôs certainly part of a bigger plan. In a column in The Guardian, Aditya Chakrabortty remarked on lack of action from the Prime Minister in such incidents: :An environmentalist invited by British MPs to testify on abuse by mining firms was yanked from her London flight just before take-off. Just as with the Gujarat pogrom, the prime minister has no direct part to play in any of this ‚Äì rather he fosters the environment that makes it all possible.

Early life  Pearlena Lewis was the oldest of seven siblings. She was raised by her father, Clarence E. Lewis, a minister, and her mother, Margaret Tucker, in the segregated South. Lewis explained that segregation made her feel as if something were wrong with her as a child. Her father helped her learn about the segregation in a way that taught her to not feel hurt or insufficient, but to realize it was wrong and to do something about it. As her father continued moving up in ministry, Lewis' family joined what was known as the \\"black middle class\\". However, Lewis continued to feel the pain of inadequacy. She recalls, \\"On T.V., all of the commercials were white. In the magazines you saw white. All the models were white. Everything seemed to be saying 'white is right'.\\" She was heavily involved in the church, and though she did not agree, she was considered a leader and role model in school. It was hard for Lewis to find work. Her father forbade her and her sisters to work as a domestic for a white family, because he did not trust the white men.  Sit-in  In her senior year of high school, Lewis met Medgar Evers at a church service. He recruited her to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) North Jackson Youth Council. Before agreeing, Lewis researched the Council thoroughly. Lewis and her friend Corlia Liddell both decided to join. Lidell was elected president of the youth council, and Lewis was elected vice president. Because Lewis was from Jackson, Evers agreed for her to participate in the Woolworth's sit-in. They held strategy sessions a week before the event, during which they planned their transportation and media messages. Lewis stated, \\"We were just tired of sitting around and listening to adults say, 'Let's try this; let's try that.' I thought we had waited long enough.\\" As a distraction from the sit-in, picketing started at J. C. Penneys. Lewis partnered with two other black students - Memphis Norman and Anne Moody - and with and John Salter, Jr., a white professor, during the event. They each had strategic timing for when they would enter, and where they should sit. Another (white) student from Tougaloo, Joan Trumpauer (now Mulholland) stood outside as a look-out for any counter-protesters, and later took a seat at the counter; Lois Chaffee, a white faculty member at Tougaloo, also sat at the counter. Though they were refused service, they remained sitting in the white section of the restaurant. Verbal abuse began, including racial slurs. Verbal abuse escalated to physical fighting. Sugar, salt, ketchup, mustard, anything on the counter, were poured over their heads and smeared on their bodies. Lewis was pulled from her chair to the ground, but she fought her way back into her seat. Moody and Lois were also pulled from their seats. Norman was knocked to the ground by a punch to his face, and once on the floor, was kicked repeatedly in the face. Salter received a cigarette burn on the back of his neck, he was hit in the jaw with brass knuckles, and a pepper water mix was thrown into his eyes. Mulholland started to fear for their lives just before things started to draw to a close. The sit-in ended at about 2:00 p.m. when the president of Tougaloo College got a hold of the National Office of Woolworth, who advised the store manager to shut the store down.Moody (2011) An undercover policeman arrested Norman and one of his attackers, former police officer Benny Oliver (who had been kicking Norman in the face), but would not escort the participants outside, although the shop was surrounded by an angry crowd, so the president of Tougaloo College, Dr. A. D. Beittel, arrived and led the protestors out of the establishment. The sit-in participants ultimately returned to NAACP headquarters. Later that night, people came together to plan and organize more demonstrations. This event started the Jackson movement to stand up and fight back. Bill Minor, then the Mississippi correspondent covering civil rights events for the New Orleans Times-Picayune and who was there that day, says the Jackson Woolworth's sit-in was \\"the signature event of the protest movement in Jackson. The first one there was with real violence.\\" The following year, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was passed into law.  Legacy  Lewis was a natural leader in everything she did. Before Evers died, he asked her to continue the Jackson movement. He believed strongly in her spirit and strength. Death Lewis died in July, 2001. She is recognized as a strong figure in the NAACP and for her work in Jackson. References 1953 births 2001 deaths Activists for African-American civil rights Nonviolence advocates F. W.

Gameplay  Like the children's game called broken telephone or simply telephone, also known as Chinese whispers, Broken Picture Telephone relies on the breakdown of communications for entertainment value. Broken Picture Telephone gameplay involves a series of 11 or more rounds per game, in which each player can participate in only one round per game. The first and last rounds always require a text contribution; written-contribution turns alternate with drawing-contribution rounds. Whichever player is randomly selected to play round two creates a drawing based on the text provided in round one; the next randomly selected player writes a description of the drawing from round two; the round four player draws whatever the round three player described; and so on. The previous player's text is presented side-by-side with the drawing interface (post-2013 version shown) in drawing rounds For writing rounds, there is a character limit constraining possible submissions. For drawing rounds, the tools provided are rudimentary, consisting of eleven colors and a few brush sizes in the 2009 edition of the game. Each player has a maximum of ten minutes to submit their description or drawing. Games persist on the BrokenPictureTelephone.com site until finished, so that players can join a game hours or even days after it was begun. Until each game is concluded by the submission of its final text round, the full sequence of rounds is not visible to any site visitor, and when playing a round, players can see only the round immediately preceding their own.

Games with mature content are flagged as such by users‚Äîeither the player who added the mature content, or any other user who views the game‚Äîand users can opt not to be shown any games with content flagged as mature.  History  Broken Picture Telephone was created by American indie developer Alishah Novin in 2007 . After Jay Is Games published a review of the game in June of that year, the influx of new players temporarily overwhelmed the BrokenPictureTelephone.com servers even though the game had been migrated to new servers in anticipation of such an increase in site visitors. Problems with server load continued, along with some bugs in the game's code and issues with malicious users trolling games; Novin took the game offline in 2010. Only a message saying that development was continuing to address the problems with the game's functionality remained accessible on the website. An Android app version of the game was released 13 October 2012, with the first bugfix release, numbered 1.01, following on 16 October. The browser version of the game remained defunct for several years until it was relaunched in 2013.  Reception  Broken Picture Telephone was rated #62 in PC Magazine list of the Top 100 Web Sites of 2009, and #5 in Jay Is Games's top ten games of 2009 in the Simple Idea category. Gamezebo praised the way its gameplay \\"tends to rapidly degenerate into hilarious misunderstandings\\" and called it \\"maybe one of the greatest online games ever.\\" Appszoom magazine called the Android release \\"insanely-addicting\\", and Jay Is Games noted that site visitors \\"can spend a lot of time just browsing through the archives of completed games and laughing at the results.\\" Academic analysis has identified BPT with the New Games movement, due to its goal being \\"a shared fun experience, rather than one team winning and one losing.\\" Numerous gaming-review sites lamented the 2010 shuttering of the game.  Similar games  Online multiplayer games with similar mechanisms of play, some of which were first released during the period when BPT was not available, include Broken Phone, DoodleOrDie, Drawception, DrawGuess and Teledraw.

I admired her elegant style, her ability to observe and her wit. Einar Rosenborg of DN accompanied her at least during the greater debates. I think it was above all he who encouraged Elin Brandell and advised her in her Riksdag Causeries. She did not actually engage in any political comments but had her strength in the skillful descriptions of the atmosphere and her quick, witty and often rather ambushing personality analysis. She was quite a celebrity and one could see how the gentlemen of the chamber glanced longingly toward her as a mention by Mrs Apolitical was a distinction, whether she delivered appreciation or criticism.

They became a local success, enjoying a hit in the Twin Cites area with their version of \\"Hey Joe\\". In hopes of reaching a wider audience they relocated, playing for a short time in Tucson, Arizona, but eventually moved their base of operations to Denver, Colorado, where they briefly signed to A&M; Records, recording an unreleased album for the label. The group made recordings at Norman Petty's studio in Clovis, New Mexico, before moving to Washington, DC in 1969 and auditioning in New York City to secure another recording arrangement that never materialized. In the intervening years since their breakup in 1969, the group's work has attracted the attention of garage rock and psychedelic enthusiasts and has been included on various re-issues and compilations. History=Minnesota The Stillroven was founded by students at Robbinsdale High School in Robbinsdale, Minnesota, a suburb of Minneapolis in 1965 and was at first known as the Syndicate. Their original lineup consisted of John Howarth and Mark Moorhead on guitars, Rock Peterson on bass, Dave Dean on keyboards, and Phil Berdahl on drums. Lead vocals usually alternated between various band members. It was soon after Mark Moorhead departed in 1966 that the band decided to change their name to the Stillroven. They recruited Danny Kane as his replacement on guitar. It was also at this time that they met local disc jockey Peter Huntington May who would become their manager and produce their records. In 1966 they went to a studio located in a basement to cut their first single, \\"She's My Woman\\" b/w their version of \\"(I'm Not Your) Stepping Stone,\\" which was released on the Falcon label. Only 50 promotional copies were pressed for radio stations. However, their next single cut at Dove Recording Studio in Bloomington, Minnesota featured a raucous version of \\"Hey Joe\\" b/w \\"Sunny Day,\\" and gained significantly more exposure than their first, becoming a hit in the Minneapolis area. The success of the single was not enough prevent Peterson and Kane from departing in 1967. They were replaced with Jim Larkin on rhythm guitar and Dave Berget on bass. Their next single, \\"Little Picture Playhouse\\" b/w \\"Cast Thy Burden Upon the Stone,\\" displayed the hallucinogenic influence of psychedelia. The band opened for Sonny and Cher (though Cher could not attend due to an illness) at the Minneapolis Auditorium. Relocating to West Still the band failed to gain traction outside of the Minneapolis area, a difficulty compounded by their manager's decision to move to Tucson, Arizona and conduct their affairs from a distance. Larkin and Berget left the band not long after they had arrived and were replaced by Mike O'Gara on guitar and Mike Flaherty of bass. In 1968, with O'Gara and Flaherty now in the lineup, they recorded a version Moby Grape's \\"Come in the Morning\\" b/w \\"Necessary Person,\\" which were both sung by O'Gara, but due to internal dissention in the group, the single was pulled after the first hundred copies were printed and then re-released with another cover version but this time of the Small Faces' \\"Tell Me Have You Ever Seen Me\\" with Dave Berget on vocals, which replaced \\"Come in the Morning\\" as the A-side. This would be the band's last original release. The band traveled to Tucson, Arizona, where for two months they were booked at the Dunes on Speedway Blvd. On April 16 they performed as an opening act for Buffalo Springfield at the Dunes and would regularly appear there through May. In July Mike Flaherty left the band and Dave Berget rejoined. The band signed under new management with James Reardon and Associates. They continued to do shows in Tucson and even scored a deal A&M; Records to record an album, which they recorded, but which has never been released. In November, the Stillroven moved their base of operations to Denver, Colorado. In April 1969 they went to Clovis, New Mexico to record several songs, which included a cover of the Temptations' \\"Get Ready,\\" at Norman Petty's studio, where such luminaries as Buddy Holly and Roy Orbison had recorded many of their hits with Petty in the 1950s. East coast In May 1969 the band traveled to Washington, DC to stay at the home of Bonnie Diamond, who had met the band earlier in Aspen, Colorado and who was known as a \\"jet setter\\" with connections in the music business. She arranged for them to audition for producer Phil Ramone and record executives from Electra Records in New York City. They were asked to audition and later record a cover version of a song from the Broadway play, Oh! Calcutta! Having no interest in recording the song, they turned down the arrangement and briefly returned to Washington, DC. They were offered a residency in New York at the Scene in Greenwich Village, but rejected it due to the early morning time slot. With a final lineup consisting of Phil Berdahl, Dave Dean, Dave Berget, Mike O‚ÄôGara, and Dave Rivkin, and with Berdahl and Dean as the only two original band members, the band finally returned to Minnesota, playing their last gig in July 1969 at a club called the Prison in Burnsville. Shortly thereafter the band broke up. Post-breakup In the intervening years following their breakup, the band's work has come to the attention of garage rock and psychedelic enthusiasts and collectors. An anthology of their work, Cast Thy Burden Upon the Stillroven, was released in on Sundazed Records in 1996. In addition to their better known songs, the album included numerous previously unreleased tracks. In 2005, the unissued album recorded for A & M in 1968 was released on the CD, Too Many Spaces.

With the help of his customers, Stewart began collecting Old West memorabilia shortly afterward. As the collection grew, it was moved multiple times. The museum was officially established as the Black American West Museum and Heritage Center in 1971 and located at 221 24th Street, where it spent one year before moving to the intersection of East Colfax Avenue and Detroit Street. Stewart next moved his collection to the Clayton School for Boys in 1975. It was moved to the Five Points neighborhood in 1985, to a space on 26th and Welton Streets.

It was designed by F H Faircloth and built in 1902. It is also known as A.E. Gorrie, Baker and Confectioner, Isis Bakery, Childers Hot Bread and Cake Shop, and Sutton's Bakery. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  The Childers Bakery is one of a row of conjoining shops situated between the Palace Hotel and Kerr's Buildings. It and the adjoining newsagency were built in 1902 for Alfred Gorrie to the design of Bundaberg architect FH Faircloth, following a fire that destroyed most of the south side of the main street of Childers. Faircloth was responsible for much of the new building following the fire, the effects of which transformed the appearance of Childers. Childers is located in what was once the heart of the Isis Scrub. Following logging of the dense Scrub in the 1870s, Childers was promoted in the 1880s by Maryborough interests as an agricultural district. The land in the immediate vicinity of the present town of Childers was surveyed in 1882 into farm blocks. There was no official town survey; Childers developed following private subdivision at the railhead of the 1887 extension line from Isis Junction. This was opened on 31 October 1887, and was intended principally to facilitate the transport of timber from the scrub. The coming of the railway not only promoted the development of the town of Childers; it also proved the catalyst for the establishment of a sugar industry in the district in the late 1880s. At the opening of the railway to Childers, Robert Cran, owner of Maryborough's Yengarie mill, announced that he would erect a double crushing juice mill at Doolbi, to supply his mill at Yengarie. This was completed in 1890, with the juice being brought in railway tankers from the Isis. Further expansion of the sugar industry in the Isis was closely related to the activities of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, which erected a central crushing mill in the district 1893-94, and began crushing in 1895. By 1895, at least three other mills had been established in the Isis, with another two under construction, and Childers had emerged as the flourishing centre of a substantial sugar-growing district. 1902 was a very dry year and Childers had no fire brigade. On 23 March, a catastrophic fire swept through the south side of the main street in town, where virtually all the buildings were timber and closely built. Those stores destroyed were: S Oakley, bootmaker; FD Cooper, commission agent; R Graham, fruiterer; ME Gosley, tailor; Foley, hairdresser; M Redmond, Palace Hotel; WB Jones, auctioneer; W Couzens, fruiterer; H Newman, general storekeeper; WJ Overell and Son, general merchants; P Christensen, cabinet maker; W Hood, stationer; T Gaydon, chemist; W Lloyd, hairdresser; Mrs Dunne, fruiterer; Federal Jewellery Company; Dunn Bros, saddlers; H Wegner, bootmaker. The Bundaberg architect F H Faircloth was engaged to redesign many of the replacement buildings and called the first tenders in June 1902. Frederic Herbert (Herb) Faircloth was born in Maryborough in 1870 and was a pupil of German-trained Bundaberg architect Anton Hettrich. Faircloth set up his own practice in Bundaberg in 1893 and was very successful, eventually being responsible for the design of almost every major building in Bundaberg. He was also to have a major effect on the appearance and character of Childers. Prior to the fire, photographs show a timber building on this site, which may have been Overell's Drapery. Following the fire, this land was purchased by Alfred Gorrie. A row of 5 shops were built, two of which were owned by Gorrie and the remaining three were owned by chemist Thomas Gaydon and occupied as a single tenancy by a hardware store. Like other post fire buildings in Childers this set of shops were masonry rather than timber, a choice no doubt influenced by the fire, and were elegant single story buildings with large glass shop fronts. Striped ogee awnings across the footpath were supported by decorative posts with cast iron infill. Each shop had a separate roof, some lit by lanterns and the individual tenancies were also marked by the visual separation of the facades by the use of classic revival pediments, urns, and balustrades. Gorrie rented out one of his shops to hairdresser and barber William Lloyd, whose premises had been destroyed in the fire. This shop he occupied himself as A.E. Gorrie, baker and confectioner. In 1930 the shop was leased to Beatrice Sutton who was also a baker and the business was later run as Sutton Brothers, bakers. In 1941 Gorrie died and the property passed to Edward Gorrie who sold it to William and Annie McKay in 1958. It was purchased in 1976 by Earle and June Robinson who subdivided the property so that each shop was on a separate title. The shop has changed hands several times before passing to the current owners, but appears to have always been a bakery. It is now Childers Hot Bread and Cake Shop.  Description  The bakery is one shop within a row of single story masonry shops built conjointly on the south side of Churchill Street, adjoining the Palace Hotel. It has a corrugated iron roof concealed by a parapet. In common with a number of shops on this side of the street, this building has classical revival pediments, some curved and some triangular, linked by a balustraded parapet topped by urns. The shop front is shaded by an ogee profile corrugated iron awning supported by posts to the street, although the cast iron valance is no longer present.  Heritage listing  The Childers Bakery was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. It is important in demonstrating the evolution of Queensland's history representing evidence of the development of Childers in the early twentieth century in particular, the rebuilding of the south side of the main street in the early 1900s following the 1902 fire. Together with much of the southern side of Childers main street it provides clear evidence of the impact of fire on Queensland towns where adequate water supply and fire services were lacking. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. It is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of early 1900s country town masonry commercial buildings, in particular the awnings, shop fronts, lanterns, and overall form. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. It contributes to the picturesque townscape of Churchill Street which is both remarkably architecturally coherent and intact. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. It has a special association with the life and work of Bundaberg architect FH Faircloth who was responsible for much of the appearance of the town of Childers in the twentieth century.

She belonged to the first female reporters in Sweden and was long portrayed as such in the Swedish press. She was employed at Svenska Dagbladet in 1897-1899 and a freelance for Dagens Nyheter from 1896 onward, and a celebrity in the contemporary Swedish press. She used the signatures Cendrillon and Catherine. Early life She was born to the sea captain S. Hallman in Trollh√§ttan. After the death of her father, she and her siblings were placed by her mother as foster siblings with relatives for economic reasons, and she was brought up as foster child by her paternal aunt and her spouse doctor G.B. Kn√∂s in Vadstena. After having finished her studies, she visited Paris in 1894. There, she shared a room with an Armenian woman and became attached to a group of Armenian radicals who called her la blonde vierge. She claimed that the group was planning to assassinate the Ottoman sultan, and that they tried to convince her to perform the assassination by having her placed as an agent in the Imperial Harem, but that she refused and returned to Sweden. In 1898, however, she visited Manchester where she was reunited with the Armenian poet and freedom fighter Stefan Sissak-Bardizbanian, whom she married. The marriage lasted for three months, after which they separated. She herself stated that she married merely because she was pregnant: she placed her son Staffan as foster son with her sister. Media career Anna Sissak-Bardizbanian is confirmed as journalist from at least 1896, when she was a freelance at Dagens Nyheter. Between 1897 and 1899, she had a steady employment as a reporter in the Svenska Dagbladet. She was often referred to as the first female reporter in the Stockholm press. A contemporary article in Illustreradt Hvad Nytt from 1898 write: \\"The Stockholm press was given its first female reporter last year when madame Anna Sissak made her entrance in the Svenska Dagbladet [...]. She writes notices and performs interviews with fearlessness and talent. Any newspaper would find a co-worker as her a sharp one. With her sympathetic female nature and personal freshness she is well received wherever she goes - which is not always the case with her male colleagues. But they are not jealous because the find in her a good and able comrade.\\"Berger, Margareta, Pennskaft: kvinnliga journalister i svensk dagspress 1690-1975 [Penholders: Female journalists in Swedish press 1690-1975], Norstedt, Stockholm, 1977 Sissak-Bardizbanian was not literary the first female reporter in the Stockholm press: between 1884 and 1896, six of the seven biggest newspapers in the capital of Stockholm employed women co-workers, and at least two were employed at Svenska Dagbladet before her - but she was certainly a member of the pioneer generation of women reporters in Stockholm and very possibly the first well known female reporter there. In 1898, she became a member of the Publicistklubben, which was still uncommon for a woman. Her employment at Svenska Dagbladet was a short one, but this was common for most reporters in the Swedish press at this time regardless of sex or success. Later life She continued as a freelance reporter the following years, but her life is somewhat unclear. She had a daughter with a millionaire in Gothenburg, who wished to marry her and unsuccessfully tried to trace her absent husband so that she could have a divorce, but never managed to find him, and adopted their daughter instead. She eventually moved to Paris, where she wrote freelance articles for Dagens Nyheter and was employed at some point at the Sainte-Genevi√®ve Library: she socialized in theosophical circles and was occasionally given money from Verner von Heidenstam and Ellen Key. According to her relative B√∂rje Kn√∂s, \\"she was very beautiful and shined with life and health and opposition to the suffocating Oscarian atmosphere here at that time\\", and that she lived \\"en entirely Bohemian life style\\" in Paris.Berger, Margareta, Pennskaft: kvinnliga journalister i svensk dagspress 1690-1975 [Penholders: Female journalists in Swedish press 1690-1975], Norstedt, Stockholm, 1977 She likely died of tuberculosis in Lugano in 1919.

Since its first recorded, nonsexual use in a tweet posted in 2009,First recorded use of \\"Netflix and Chill\\" on twitter.com the phrase has gained popularity within the Twitter community and other social media sites like Facebook and Vine. By 2015, \\"Netflix and chill\\" had become an Internet meme and its use on teenage social media was commonly described as \\"sexual\\" by Fusion. History=Origins The first recorded use of the phrase \\"Netflix and chill\\" was in a Twitter post by \\"NoFaceNina\\" (La Shanda Rene Foster) on January 21, 2009. It said, \\"I'm about to log onto Netflix and chill for the rest of the night.\\" Early use of the phrase was without sexual connotations, referring simply to the act of watching the online streaming service, typically by oneself. By 2013, Netflix's popularity in the US had risen greatly, having accumulated millions of paid subscribers, increasing verb use of the brand and this phrase as a standalone compound noun. The euphemistic nature of the phrase is believed to have been established in mid-2014, and by the end of the year had spread throughout the African- American Black Twitter community, as seen by many now typing chill within scare quotes. In April 2015, a definition of the phrase was added to Urban Dictionary stating that it meant \\"code for two people going to each other's houses and [having sexual intercourse] or doing other sexual related acts\\". Soon, the term would spread beyond the Black Twitter community, becoming an Internet meme and gaining the attention of news websites such as The Guardian and the Daily Mirror. Impact As the phrase entered into common lexicon, events, products, and services associated with the phrase started to emerge, including acknowledgement from Netflix itself. In September 2015, a joke app in the style of Tinder had been created for users to organize \\"Netflix and chill\\" sessions. At two separate universities, students planned \\"Netflix and chill\\" festivals, with one being canceled by authorities as they believed too many people would be in attendance. During the World Maker Faire in New York, Netflix unveiled a prototype for a large button called \\"The Switch\\", which, when pressed, will dim the lights in the users' residence, activate the \\"Do Not Disturb\\" feature on their cell phones, and prepare Netflix for streaming‚Äîeliminating most distractions from their activities. This has been frequently referred to as the \\"Netflix and chill button\\". In October 2015, entrepreneur Kori Williams created and sold a line of condoms named Netflix and Chill. The condoms were approved by the FDA for use to prevent pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases. In November 2015, the Netflix logo outside the company's headquarters in Los Gatos, California had been spray-painted to add the words \\"and chill\\". In December 2015 Ariana Grande released the holiday EP Christmas & Chill, its title a seasonal variation on \\"Netflix and chill\\". In January 2016, artist Tom Galle and company ART404 created a \\"Netflix & Chill Room\\" in New York City for rent on Airbnb. In early February 2016, Netflix released the results of a survey on how users in relationships use their service, described as a \\"Netflix and chill study\\". The results were accompanied with a series of social media posts with the hashtag \\"#DatingWithNetflix\\" promoting the idea of a positive impact for couples using the service. In June 2016, singer-songwriter Danah released a song titled \\"Netflix and Chill\\" on SoundCloud. The track was produced by Wippy Lion, a member of Australian pop group Justice Crew. The song is a tongue-in-cheek representation of the term's use in popular culture. In January 2020, Ben & Jerry's announced a new ice cream flavor called \\"Netflix & Chilll'd\\".

Oldroyd and her husband, Tom Shaw Oldroyd, amassed one of the largest private shell collections in California. Ida was recognized as an active and early pioneer of conchology in the western United States. She was a charter member of the American Malacological Union, which she served as vice-president in 1934 and as honorary president from 1935 to 1940. Early life Ida Mary Shepard was born on November 25, 1856 in Goshen, Indiana, to parents William H. and Delia Mary (Gillett) Shepard. She attended high school in Saline, Michigan, and attended the University of Michigan from 1883 to 1885, earning a teaching certificate but not graduating. In 1888 her family moved to Long Beach, California, where she began collecting shells. In September, 1895, she married Tom Shaw Oldroyd, a fellow shell collector. The two collected extensively in southern California, amassing a large collection and obtaining rare specimens brought in on the nets of fishermen. Career In 1914, Oldroyd was recruited by the California Academy of Sciences to classify and pack a portion of the shell collection of Henry Hemphill, in preparation of the collection's transfer to the Academy following Hemphill's death. In 1916 she was hired by Stanford University, which had then acquired the Hemphill collection, to catalog the collection. A year later, Stanford purchased the Oldroyds' private collection and hired the Oldroyds as curators in the Department of Geology, where they served for the rest of their lives. In the mid 1920s, the Stanford shell collection was the second largest in the world. They continued to collect from California and Washington state, and in 1929‚Äì30 traveled the world, collecting and facilitating the acquisition of large collections upon their return. In 1922 she was hired as a consultant by the American Museum of Natural History in New York, where she spent several months studying and organizing the conchology collection. Oldroyd produced several papers, and is known for her major works: Marine Shells of Puget Sound and Vicinity (1924) and The Marine Shells of the West Coast of North America, a four-volume series published between 1924 and 1927. Oldroyd was a charter member of the American Malacological Union and served as its vice-president in 1934 and as honorary president from 1935 to 1940. Death and legacy Oldroyd died on July 9, 1940 in Palo Alto, California, at the age of 83 after several months of declining health. At the time of her death, the Stanford shell collection was considered the largest of any American university. Oldroyd described over 20 species of mollusk as well as a species of coral. She is commemorated in the names of several mollusk species, including Tellina idae Dall, 1891; Mitra idae Melvill, 1893; Odostomia (Chrysallida) oldroydi Dall & Bartsch, 1909; Alvania oldroydae Bartsch, 1911; Bittium oldroydae Bartsch, 1911; and Melanella oldroydae Bartsch, 1917, as well as the coral Dendrophyllia oldroydae. Husband Tom Shaw Oldroyd was born in Huddersfield, England, on June 13, 1853, and his family moved to Flushing, New York, in 1855. In 1880 he moved to California, settling in Long Beach where he began collecting shells. Tom specialized in fossil shells of the Pleistocene. He died of heart trouble on November 3, 1932, at the age of 80. He is commemorated in the names of around 10 species.

The film is directed by Adam Wingard and written by Charles & Vlas Parlapanides and Jeremy Slater. The film stars Nat Wolff, Lakeith Stanfield, Margaret Qualley, Shea Whigham, Paul Nakauchi, Jason Liles and Willem Dafoe, and follows the story of an American high school student named Light Turner, who finds a mysterious supernatural notebook known as the \\"Death Note\\", which can kill anyone whose name is written in its pages. The film was screened at FrightFest in London, and was then released on Netflix on August 25, 2017, and received mixed to negative reviews. A sequel is currently in the works, with Greg Russo attached to write the screenplay. Plot In Seattle, Washington, high schooler Light Turner stumbles across the \\"Death Note\\", a mysterious leather-bound notebook with instructions that state that by writing a person's name down within it, that person will die in the manner prescribed. Light then meets the death god Ryuk, the notebook's owner. Ryuk convinces Light to use the notebook; Light writes down a bully's name and shortly witnesses him killed in a freak accident. That night, Light tries it again, using the name of his mother's killer, Anthony Skomal, and learns the next morning from his father James, a police detective, that Skomal died as Light had written. At school, Light shows Mia the book, and demonstrates by killing a known criminal felon during a televised hostage situation. The two decide to work together to rid the world of criminals and terrorists, using the name \\"Kira\\" (derived from the Japanese trans-literation for \\"Killer\\", so as direct investigative attention away from their continent). Kira's actions draw the attention of enigmatic international detective \\"L\\", who deduces Kira is a Seattle-based student with close ties to the police, and indirectly concludes Kira can only kill by knowing the name and face of their victim. Working with James and police, L has several FBI agents track Light and other suspects. Light refuses to kill them when Mia suggests it, but soon the agents commit mass suicide, which Light believes Ryuk made them do. James threatens Kira over public broadcast but when he fails to be killed, L confronts Light about being Kira, and prepares the police to thoroughly search Light's home. Light decides to use the Death Note to force L's personal assistant Watari to travel to Montauk, New York and find L's adoption record there; Light plans to burn the notebook page with Watari's name once he knows L's name to stop Watari's death, and then kill L. Mia helps to sneak the notebook out before the search. Light and Mia go to the school prom, using the event to ditch L and police. Light recovers the notebook just as Watari contacts him with L's name from the orphanage he was raised in, but Light cannot find the page in the notebook. Watari is then killed by security for trespassing before he can reveal L's name, being \\"Lebens Dorn\\". Light discovers Mia took Watari's page, caused the agents' suicide, and has written Light's name in the book, set to kill him at midnight, but she offers to burn his page if he turns the notebook over to her. Light flees, telling Mia to meet him at the Seattle Great Wheel. Meanwhile, L learns of Watari's death and becomes unstable, leaving on a personal manhunt against Light, while James orders L to be detained. L corners Light, but a Kira Supporter, hearing that Light is Kira, knocks L out, letting Light escape. Mia meets Light at the wheel, and they ride to the top. There, Mia steals the notebook, but realizes too late this was Light's plan: Light has written her death in the notebook contingent on her taking it. Ryuk then makes the wheel collapses, sending Mia falling to her death, while Light and the notebook fall into the nearby waters. The page with Light's name lands in a burning barrel in front of L's eyes. Prior to meeting Mia, Light had used the book to coerce a criminally-charged doctor to rescue him and put him into a medically-induced coma, while having another criminal recover the Death Note and continue Kira's killings before returning the book to his bedside, killing both after their role is complete. Meanwhile, L is ordered off the case for his apparent misconducts, but in defiance he raids Mia's home, finding the notebook page with the agents' names and deduces its capabilities. In a hysterical fit, he considers writing Light's name. When Light wakes from his coma at a hospital with James, who has come to conclude Light is Kira, by his side, he tries to convince James that his actions were \\"the lesser of two evils\\", prompting Ryuk to laugh and comment that \\"humans are so interesting\\" ending the film. Cast * Nat Wolff as Light Turner / Kira: A bright yet isolated high-school student who discovers the titular \\"Death Note\\" and uses it to kill criminals by writing their names and causes of death, in a bid to change the world into a utopia without crime, and thus, alongside Mia Sutton, becoming the world-famous serial killer known as \\"Kira\\", while being both praised and feared by law enforcement agencies and the worldwide media and public. In stark contrast to his manga counterpart, this version of Light lacks much of the original's ruthless, sadistic and sociopathic tendencies and is depicted in a more sympathetic and humanized light. * Lakeith Stanfield as Lebensborn Atubia / L: A nameless, highly-intelligent and esteemed‚Äîbut also socially eccentric and quirky‚Äîinternational consulting detective with a past shrouded in mystery and who is determined to capture \\"Kira\\" and end his reign of terror. * Margaret Qualley as Mia Sutton / Kira: Light's classmate and girlfriend, who assists him in his world-wide massacre of criminals as the god-like vigilante: \\"Kira\\", eventually seeking to kill those who seek to stop them and becoming dangerously obsessed with the book's power. In an interview with io9, Adam Wingard revealed that rather than being based on the manga character Misa Amane, Sutton is an original character based on the sociopathic qualities of Light Yagami. * Shea Whigham as Detective James Turner: Light's widowed father and a veteran Seattle police detective, who assists L in finding the mysterious \\"Kira\\", unaware that he is his own son. Unlike the original manga version, James has lost his wife in an acquitted hit and run crime and has a more strained relationship with his son. * Paul Nakauchi as Watari: L's assistant and foster-father. *Jason Liles and Willem Dafoe as Ryuk: A demonic Shinigami (god of death) and the original owner of the Death Note, who begins communicating with Light when he receives the book and inquisitively observes his activities as \\"Kira\\" with amusement. Liles played the character in costume, while Dafoe provided voice work and performance capture for the facial elements. Producer Masi Oka makes a cameo as Detective Sasaki: a Tokyo police detective investigating one of Light's murders. Chris Britton, who played Sochiro Yagami, James Turner's original counterpart from the manga, in the English dub of the Death Note anime, makes a cameo appearance as Aaron Peltz, a serial child molester and one of Light's victims.  Production =Development In 2007, the Malaysian newspaper The Star stated that more than ten film companies in the United States had expressed interest in the Death Note franchise. The American production company Vertigo Entertainment was originally set to develop the remake, with Charley and Vlas Parlapanides as screenwriters and Roy Lee, Doug Davison, Dan Lin, and Brian Witten as producers. On April 30, 2009, Variety reported that Warner Bros., the distributors for the original Japanese live-action films, had acquired the rights for an American remake, with the original screenwriters and producers still attached. In 2009, Zac Efron responded to rumors that he would be playing the film's lead role by stating that the project was \\"not on the front burner\\". On January 13, 2011, it was announced that Shane Black had been hired to direct the film, with the script being written by Anthony Bagarozzi and Charles Mondry. Warner's studios planned to change the background story of Light Yagami into one of vengeance instead of justice and to remove Shinigami from the story. Black opposed this change, and it had not been green-lit. Black confirmed in a 2013 interview with Bleeding Cool that he was still working on the film. In July 2014, it was rumored that Gus Van Sant would replace Black as the film's new director, with Dan Lin, Doug Davison, Roy Lee and Brian Witten producing through Vertigo Entertainment, Witten Pictures and Lin Pictures. On April 27, 2015, The Hollywood Reporter revealed that Adam Wingard would direct the film, that Lin, Lee, Jason Hoffs and Masi Oka would produce, and that Niija Kuykendall and Nik Mavinkurve would oversee the studio. Producers stated the film would receive an R rating. In April 2016, TheWrap reported that because Warner Bros. had decided to make fewer films, the studio put the film into turnaround but allowed Wingard to take the project elsewhere. Within 48 hours, Wingard was reportedly approached by nearly every major film studio. On April 6, 2016, it was confirmed that Netflix had bought the film from Warner Bros. with a budget of $40‚Äì50 million and a recent draft of the script being written by Jeremy Slater. Production officially began in British Columbia on June 30, 2016, (where Vancouver doubled as Seattle) overseen by DN (Canada) Productions, Inc. Atticus Ross and Leopold Ross composed the score for the film. Casting The cast and crew of Death Note at the 2017 San Diego Comic-Con On September 29, 2015, Nat Wolff was cast in the lead role. On November 12, 2015, Margaret Qualley joined the film as the female lead. In June 2016, Lakeith Stanfield joined the cast. On June 30, 2016, it was announced that Paul Nakauchi and Shea Whigham had joined the cast. On August 2, 2016, Willem Dafoe was announced to voice the Shinigami Ryuk. In the wake of Dafoe's casting, Brian Drummond, who voiced Ryuk in the English dub of the anime, voiced his approval citing the casting of Ryuk. Oka, one of the film's producers, announced that he also has a role in the film. Early casting announcements, similar to other Hollywood productions based on Japanese manga such as Dragonball Evolution and Ghost in the Shell, resulted in accusations of whitewashing. In response, producers Roy Lee and Dan Lin stated that \\"Our vision for Death Note has always been to...introduce the world to this dark and mysterious masterpiece. The talent and diversity represented in our cast, writing, and producing teams reflect our belief in staying true to the story's concept of moral relevance‚Äîa universal theme that knows no racial boundaries.\\" Wingard addressed the concerns over the film, explaining that the film is an American take on the Death Note story, stating, \\"It's one of those things where the harder I tried to stay 100 percent true to the source material, the more it just kind of fell apart... You're in a different country, you're in a different kind of environment, and you're trying to also summarize a sprawling series into a two-hour-long film. For me, it became about; what do these themes mean to modern day America, and how does that affect how we tell the story.\\" Wingard also stated that he mainly attempted to make a unique and different take on the original manga, while also trying to keep the core themes and elements of the original manga intact, such as the cat and mouse dynamic between the main protagonists: Light and L, the themes of morality and justice, the difference between good and evil, certain characteristics and elements of the original manga characters (such as Light's father still being a police officer, L's mannerisms and personality traits, along with his background and past originating from a secluded orphanage, Light being depicted as an intellectually-gifted and introverted high school student, Ryuk's personality traits and affinity for apples).  Release  The film was screened at FrightFest in London, before being released on Netflix on August 25, 2017. On July 20, 2017, the film was screened early for audiences at San Diego Comic-Con International 2017.  Marketing  On March 22, 2017, Netflix released a teaser of the film on YouTube. An additional trailer was released on June 29, 2017.  Critical reception  Death Note received mixed reviews. On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 39% based on 74 reviews, and an average rating of 4.73/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Death Note benefits from director Adam Wingard's distinctive eye and a talented cast, but they aren't enough to overcome a fatally overcrowded canvas.\\" Metacritic gave the film a score of 43 out of 100, based on 14 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Jeanette Catsoulis for The New York Times wrote that the film \\"feels rushed and constricted\\" compared to the volume of the source material, but praised how Wingard's direction focused on \\"mood over mayhem\\" to make the adaptation his own. Peter Debruge for Variety said that he felt that Wingard took the film adaptation towards a Donnie Darko-styled work that would capture the interest of more Western audiences compared to the original work, but made the work capture the feel of a theatrical film rather than a work confined to its original medium. Debruge also wrote that despite the philosophical concepts of murdering via the Death Note, \\"the movie never quite reckons with just how twisted a concept it‚Äôs peddling, and that‚Äôs easily the scariest thing about it\\". Brian Tallerico for Rogerebert.com gave the film one of four stars, stating that the changes that Wingard had made from the original work did not serve any artistic or thematic purpose, nor captured the cat-and-mouse game between Light and L that was core to the original work, and because the producers \\"refused to make Light the antihero he needed to be\\", the addition of Mia as a love interest \\"[left] the project hollow at its center\\", but mainly praised the performances of Stanfield and Dafoe. Tsugumi Ohba and Takeshi Obata, the original creators of Death Note, have praised the film, with the former stating, \\"In a good way, it both followed and diverged from the original work so the film can be enjoyed, of course by not only the fans, but also by a much larger and wider audience\\".  Controversy  A few months after release, it was discovered that the images of the train accident in the movie were real footage of a 2010 train collision in Buizingen, Belgium in which 19 people died. Both the rail operator and survivors have criticized this as disrespectful to the victims.  Sequel  In an interview with Heat Vision, director Adam Wingard stated that Netflix had wanted to make at least two films, if enough people watch the first one. He said: \\"There are definitely lots of places to go, and we know generally where we would take it. Hopefully people will watch it and Netflix will order a sequel. They definitely are ready to. They just need people to watch it.\\" On August 22, 2018, it was announced through a THR report that a sequel was in the works, with Greg Russo reportedly writing the script, after Sarandos called the film a \\"sizable\\" success.

Early military and political career A son of a landed peasant, Boldin was fortunate enough to attend primary and two years of secondary school before beginning work with his father. In 1914 he moved into the village of Vysokaya where he worked in grain processing and bread making. He was drafted into the Russian Imperial Army on July 28, 1914, during World War I. He received several months of infantry training before his regiment, the 23rd Rifle Regiment, was deployed to Sarakomysh on the Turkish front. He served for three years on this front against the Turks, taking part in operations around Erzurum and Kars, and also completing his secondary schooling.Glantz, p 46 Following the February Revolution in 1917, Boldin became politically active. He served as an elected member of his regimental and divisional revolutionary committees until he was demobilized in December, when he returned to the Insa Region. After the Bolsheviks seized power he became active in local and regional politics. From January 7 to March 14, 1918, he was assistant head of the Insa District Executive Committee, then chaired it until January 7, 1919. He joined the Communist Party in June 1918, and attended the All-Russian Congress of Soviets in July, representing Penza. Following this he served in several positions in local administration and in the Party. In October 1919, Boldin restarted his military career by volunteering for service in the Red Army in the ongoing Civil War. At its height, he served as a company commander fighting Finnish forces on the Karelian peninsula. He then went to Western Front, fighting in defense of Petrograd against White Russian forces, and later against Polish forces near Polotsk and Lepel in the Polish‚ÄìSoviet War. In April 1920, he was promoted to command of a battalion, and in August to a regiment. By December 1921, Boldin had shown enough military potential that he was enrolled in the Vystrel Officer Rifle School, from which he graduated in September 1923.Glantz, p 46-47 Between the wars Boldin was posted to Tula after his graduation, taking command of a rifle regiment that he had to form from scratch. He also got involved in political work by serving in the city's Soviet. In November 1924, he was assigned to form and command the Separate Moscow Rifle Regiment (later 1st Moscow Separate RR) as a training establishment for testing new weaponry. Boldin remained politically active, serving as a member of the Moscow Regional Bolshevik Committee. From November 1925 to October 1926 he attended the Frunze Military Academy, while also keeping up his political activity. In a pattern of military and political assignments, Boldin moved up a ladder of increasingly responsible assignments until 1939, and his loyalty was unquestioned during the 1937 purges.Glantz, p 47-48 Occupation of Poland, Latvia and Bessarabia In September 1939, Boldin was chosen to command a Cavalry-Mechanized Group in the Special Western Military District on the border of Poland. This mobile grouping of two cavalry corps, one tank corps, one rifle corps, and a separate tank brigade, formed the mobile lead of Belorussian Front when it entered eastern Poland on the morning of September 17. After this short, undistinguished campaign, later in that month Boldin was assigned to head the military delegation which effected the Soviet occupation of Latvia. His next assignment came in October when he was named as commander of the Odessa Military District. In June 1940, the STAVKA formed a Southern Group of Forces with the intention of staging an invasion of Romanian Bessarabia. Gen G.K. Zhukov, commander of Kiev Military District, was given overall command of the Group, with Boldin in command of the bulk of the Group's forces, the 9th Army. The invasion was carried out from June 28‚Äì30, and Boldin was simultaneously promoted to the rank of lieutenant general.Glantz, pp 48-49 Great Patriotic War At the outbreak of Operation Barbarossa, Boldin was the deputy of Gen. Dmitry Pavlov, commander of the Western Military District. Both men saw clear indications of the impending attack, but their warnings to the High Command were ignored. Late on June 22, Pavlov ordered Boldin by phone to mount a counter-attack against German forces advancing on Grodno. Boldin flew in a light aircraft under heavy fire to the command post of 10th Army near Bialystok. In the prevailing chaos it was impossible to carry out any effective attack, and by June 27 the 3rd, 4th and 10th Armies were all encircled west of Minsk. Boldin, at the head of a small group, spent the next 45 days fighting for survival behind enemy lines. Finally, on August 10, leading a total of 1,650 officers and men, his group broke through to Soviet lines near Smolensk. STAVKA Order No. 270 praised the feat of Boldin's \\"division\\", and he became a popular hero in those dark days.Glantz, p 49 His next assignment was back in the re-formed Western Front, as deputy to his old friend, Gen. I.S. Konev. As Army Group Center launched Operation Typhoon on October 2, Boldin was assigned to command a Front operational group, once again to mount a counter-attack against advancing German forces. This was little more successful than the first, and soon he and his group was encircled near Vyazma. In the course of a successful breakout Boldin was wounded, and spent the next month in hospital and recuperation in Moscow.Glantz, p 49-50 In late November, he was summoned to a meeting by Marshal B.M. Shaposhnikov, Chief of the Red Army General Staff, and assigned to command 50th Army, currently in Western Front and defending the city of Tula. The previous commander, Mjr. Gen. A.N. Yermakov, had been arrested for dereliction of duty as a result of his actions when the army had been partly encircled at Bryansk.Glantz, Colossus Reborn, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2005, pp 681-82n82 Boldin later admitted that defending the city against Gen. Guderian was a challenging task to undertake. But although Tula was very deeply outflanked by the beginning of December, it never fell. In conjunction with the rebuilt 1st Guards Cavalry Corp and 10th Army, 50th went on the offensive and drove Guderian's forces back from the southern approaches to Moscow later that month.Glantz, p 50 Boldin remained continuously in command of 50th Army until February 1945, being promoted to the rank of Colonel-General on July 15, 1944. In spite of his public image as a hero, his superiors saw his military gifts as limited; the 50th Army was usually relatively low in strength and was used in secondary roles. In October 1943, the Army was transferred to Belorussian Front and Boldin came under command of Gen. K.K. Rokossovsky. The latter shared the general opinion of Boldin's talents and kept him in limited roles until his army was transferred to 2nd Belorussian Front in April 1944. Subsequently, in November, Rokossovsky was moved to the latter Front, and again Boldin was under his command. When the East Prussian operation began on January 14, 1945, the 50th Army was sent to keep an eye on the German forces defending along the August√≥w Canal. All but a small rearguard of those slipped away to battle the Front's main forces and it was 48 hours before Boldin noticed, all the while reporting that the full force was still in place. Rokossovsky had seen enough, and in February, just as the army was being transferred to 3rd Belorussian Front, Boldin was relieved of command, and his chief of staff, Lt. Gen. F.P. Ozerov, took over for the duration.Dr. Boris Sokolov, Marshal K.K. Rokossovsky, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2015, p 380 After two months on the sidelines, Boldin was appointed as deputy commander of the 3rd Ukrainian Front in the final weeks of the war. Later life Beginning in July 1945, Boldin spent a year in command of an army, this time the 27th. He then got the prestigious assignment of command of the 8th Guards Army of the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany, which he held until March 1951, likely because of his political reliability. He commanded the Eastern Siberian Military District for two years, and after a short stint in Gorky Military District, he was assigned as First Deputy Commander-in-Chief of Kiev Military District until 1958. He was now due for retirement, with a final assignment as Military Consultant to the Defense Ministry Group of General Inspectors.Glantz, pp 52-53 In 1961, he published his memoirs, Pages of Life, and also several articles about the initial days of the war and his role in the defense of Tula in the journal, Voenno- istoricheskii Zhurnal. He died in Kiev on March 28, 1965. ReferencesFurther reading *David Glantz, \\"Ivan Vasilievich Boldin\\", in Stalin's Generals, (Harold Shukman, Ed.), Phoenix Press, 2001 *K. K.

The 1981 edition was approved by Pope Paul VI through the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments which authorizes exemplary Marian images that are approved for a Canonical Coronation. The work is also considered as an important instruction and teaching in Mariology, Marian cult and devotion.

Early life  Shimizu was born in Miki, Hyogo, Japan on 23 April 1984. He started playing baseball when he was in the second grade at Hirata Elementary School in Miki, becoming the team's catcher due to his strong arm. After leading Miki Junior High School to third place in a regional tournament as the team's catcher and number four batter, he wanted to enroll in a high school known for its baseball program. However on his parents' advice that \\"only a handful can feed themselves playing baseball\\", he instead enrolled in the academically known Ono High School in Miki. He became the high school's main catcher in the summer of his first year, helping his team reach the quarter finals of the Hyogo Prefectural High School Tournament in his final year. Heeding his parents advice further, Shimizu enrolled at Kwansei Gakuin University rather than trying to turn professional after high school. Due to an injury to the university club's main catcher, he was able to take the role immediately upon joining the club, remaining in the position for his four years of university. In his final year he was named in the Kansai University League's best nine in both the spring and autumn seasons. He had a total of 6 home runs while at university. Shimizu was drafted by the Hanshin Tigers in the fourth round of the 2006 university/adult draft. Professional career In 2007 Shimizu was evaluated highly during practice matches and pre-season matches, earning a place on the first-team roster for the start of the season. However, he did not get an opportunity to play for the first team and was eventually sent to the Tigers' farm team in the Western League. He played 41 games for the farm team, with a batting average of .260 and 5 home runs. In 2008, he played in 54 Western League matches, including 47 as a catcher. His batting average fell and he hit only 3 home runs. During the year he was wearing contact lenses, but underwent laser corrective surgery at the end of the year. In 2009, he again started the season in the first-team squad due to leading catcher Akihiro Yano being injured. He made his first appearance for the Tigers' first team in the second match of the season, on 4 April 2009 against the Tokyo Yakult Swallows. On 17 May he made his first start and recorded his first hit, also against the Swallows. He appeared in a total of 20 first-team games, as well as 23 games for the farm team in which he had a batting average of .278. Personal life At the end of the 2009 season Shimizu announced his intention to marry a classmate from his junior high school in December 2009.

She was the first woman elected as president of the Texas Society of Pathologists (1945), of the Tarrant County Medical Society (1947), and of the Texas Medical Association (1960). She endowed the second chair of the Texas Tech University School of Medicine and received many awards during her career, including induction into the Texas Women's Hall of Fame, Recognition of Merit from the Texas Medical Association, and receipt of the George T.

In 1912, she enrolled in Texas Christian University and upon graduation in 1917 began working in the medical laboratory of Truman C. Terrell in Fort Worth, Texas. She applied to numerous medical schools but was rejected because they did not accept women, but did gain approval when she applied to the University of Louisville School of Medicine, in Louisville, Kentucky. The 1918 flu pandemic convinced her to pursue a career in pathology and Owen graduated with her degree in 1921. She returned briefly to Fort Worth and after receiving approval to observe autopsies at the Mayo Clinic, she traveled to Rochester, Minnesota. Her observation of a few weeks turned into a job for one year, after which she went to Madison, Wisconsin to study anesthesiology. By 1927, she had returned to Fort Worth and joined both the Tarrant County Medical Society and the State Medical Association of Texas. Career In 1933, Owen accepted a position as a pathologist at Bellevue Hospital Center in New York City, but after a year, she returned to Terrell's lab, where she eventually became chief pathologist for Terrell Laboratories. In 1936, she discovered that the talcum powder used on surgical gloves caused infection and peritoneal scarring. The discovery led to changes in surgical practices and an award of an honorary doctorate for Owen from Texas Christian University. In 1945, she was elected as the first woman president of the Texas Society of Pathologists and two years later, in 1947, she was elected as the first woman president of the Tarrant County Medical Society.

The Tarrant County Medical Society honored her with the Gold-Headed Cane Award in 1952 for her research, and she was later recognized by the American Veterinary Medical Association. In 1953 Owen received a Recognition of Merit from the Texas Medical Association (TMA) for an occupational medicine exhibit. In 1958, she was awarded the George T. Caldwell Award from the Texas Society of Pathologists. In 1960, Owen was elected as the first woman president of the TMA and nine years later, they honored her as only the fifth person and first woman with the Distinguished Service Award. In 1965, Owen sponsored a health fair to raise funds for a health museum, which was subsequently built and named the May Owen Hall of Medical Science in her honor. In 1966, she contributed $300,000 to establish a scholarship trust fund through the TMA for medical students.

A follow-up to 1971's The London Howlin' Wolf Sessions, the concept was to combine American bluesmen with British blues/rock stars. The album was an attempt to capitalise on the increasing popularity of traditional blues music and blues artists in Britain. The London Muddy Waters Sessions won the 1972 Grammy Award for Best Ethnic or Traditional Folk Recording; it marked the second of six times that Muddy Waters would win that award. The Players The album features Waters on slide and acoustic guitar, backed by Sammy Lawhorn and Rory Gallagher on guitar, Carey Bell Harrington on harmonica, Rick Grech on bass, George Fortune and Steve Winwood on piano and organ, Mitch Mitchell from Jimi Hendrix Experience and Herbie Novelle on drums and Rosetta Hightower on vocals, Ernie Royal and Joe Newman on trumpet, Garnett Brown on trombone and Seldon Powell on tenor saxophone. Irish blues- rocker Gallagher, who began a successful solo career following the demise of his trio, Taste, played on three tracks, providing solos on \\"Young Fashion Ways\\" and two others. Winwood reprised his keyboard role on the Howlin' Wolf sessions, making appearances on three tracks. Fortune, a swinging-jazz-blues player, played on the remaining tracks. Mitchell, who had worked with Georgie Fame's Blues Flames prior to joining the Jimi Hendrix Experience and drew his greatest inspiration from jazzmen such as Elvin Jones, played on most of the album. On the shuffles like \\"I'm Ready\\" and \\"Blind Man Blues\\", the drummer is New York session veteran Novelle. Grech was best known as one-fourth of Blind Faith, together with Winwood. It is also noteworthy that Blind Faith included two ex-Cream members, Ginger Baker and Eric Clapton -- the latter having played on The London Howlin' Wolf Sessions, but Grech had become a member of Traffic, another band led by Winwood. Blues harp man Carey Bell was essential. Like Muddy, Bell was born in Mississippi and came of age in Chicago; Like Lawhorn, he was a long-time member of Muddy Waters' band, having previously worked with John Lee Hooker, Eddie Taylor and Earl Hooker. Bell alternated between a standard Marine Band harp and the big double-key chromatic harp which was his specialty.

By 1872, the legislature established the State Board of Education, which was to consist of the Governor, Secretary of State, and an elected Superintendent of Public Instruction. The Board had authorization to approve textbooks, approve rules for schools, grant diplomas and teacher certifications, and revoke diplomas and certificates on grounds of immorality or non-professionalism. Board membership and responsibilities remained essentially the same until 1941, with additional boards and commissions added to report to the State Board of Education, such as the state Board of Textbook Commissioners in 1899; the State Board for Vocational Education in 1919; and the Commission on Americanization to focus on immigrants in 1925.

Deconsecrated after World War Two, it became the property of the Comune di Ivrea in the 1970s, who converted it into a conference hall. The Baroque portal was moved to the parish church of San Bernardino in Ivrea.Comune of Ivrea, entry on church.

The film stars Kevin James, Zulay Henao, Andy Garc√≠a, Maurice Compte, Kelen Coleman, Andrew Howard, and Rob Riggle. The film was released on November 11, 2016. Plot Sam Larson (Kevin James) is a lonely accountant who plans to publish a fictional novel, Memoirs of an International Assassin, which is about an assassin who goes about murdering people for money, but is having trouble with his ending, especially the signature line his main character says at the end of the book. While playing pool with his good friend Amos (Ron Rifkin), Amos tells Larson about a mysterious assassin, known as the Ghost, who supposedly died in a helicopter crash, but some say he jumped before the helicopter crashed. Inspired, Larson finishes his novel with that ending, despite Amos's objections. His novel finished, Larson has trouble finding someone to publish his novel, but just as he is about to give up, he gets a call from a virtual publisher, Kylie Applebaum (Kelen Coleman), who wants to publish his book. Larson agrees, but a couple of days later, he finds his book's title changed to a nonfictional memoir called True Memoirs of an International Assassin. He confronts Applebaum about this, and she reveals that she changed it to get more copies sold. He finds himself ostracized from Amos, who feels that Larson betrayed him by revealing information that he didn't want to be revealed, and tells Larson to stop writing other peoples' stories and start living his own. After Amos confronts him, Larson tells Applebaum that he cannot be this person anymore, but Applebaum reveals that she got Larson an interview with Katie Couric. Larson initially isn't sure but decides to do it after Applebaum mentions that she has ten other authors who want this opportunity. At the interview, Couric reads a passage that indicates that Larson was addicted to death (which is why he became an assassin). At this, Larson becomes uncomfortable, and promptly flees the scene, and returns home. Soon after, however, he gets kidnapped and sedated. When Larson wakes up, he is greeted by El Toro (Andy Garc√≠a), a terrorist who wants to start a revolution by murdering the President of Venezuela, Miguel Cueto (Kim Coates), (thus revealing Larson is in Venezuela), and El Toro wants Larson to do it himself, since he believes him to be the Ghost. El Toro warns Larson that if he wasn't the Ghost, he would kill him slowly, thus prompting Larson to lie about him being the Ghost. Larson then asks El Toro to get him a reconnaissance in Caracas, and El Toro tells his second-in-command, Juan (Maurice Compte), to take him there. At the reconnaissance, Juan reveals that he suspects Larson not to be the Ghost, and threatens to kill him. Larson then escapes while he is distracted. Larson then tells the nearest police about the situation and asks to take him to the Embassy. However, there the police reveal their true intentions, being the henchmen of the gangster Anton Masovich (Andrew Howard), and demands money. Larson then tries to call Applebaum, but believing that he is just playing with her, Applebaum hangs up. Before the police can kill him, Larson is saved by a DEA agent, Rosa Bolivar (Zulay Henao). After they escape, Bolivar asks Larson to talk with Masovich to clear up the situation. There, Masovich asks Larson to kill El Toro, as he would be affected should the president be killed. Larson pretends to agree after seeing Masovich's violent behavior. Meanwhile, CIA agents William Cobb (Rob Riggle) and Michael Cleveland (Leonard Earl Howze) meet with the president and General Ruiz (Yul Vazquez) in regards to Larson, and they agree to meet with him. Larson and Bolivar then talk about the situation at a restaurant, but before they can do anything, Juan, who caught up with Larson, captures and takes him hostage. Juan and Larson then talk about the situation regarding the President. However, Larson tries to get Juan to steal a truck, but in the process, he gets captured by General Ruiz. General Ruiz then talks about the situations and how they are unnecessary and asks Larson to kill Masovich, as he has too much power, else Larson will be tried and executed for his involvement with killing the president, prompting Larson to agree. Cobb and Cleveland, who noticed this, decides to kill him indirectly, by filling in Masovich, who goes into a violent rage when he hears that Larson betrayed him. Larson meets Bolivar and fills her in with the situation. Bolivar then reveals that she always wanted to kill Masovich, as the DEA had written her off thanks to him. She then comes up with the plan that will humiliate both Masovich and the president, but Larson initially refuses, stating he just wants to go home. They are then promptly attacked by Masovich's minions, and they escape, but not before Sam gets shot in the shoulder. After they find a safe place, Bolivar changes her mind about the plan, but Larson is ready to do it. Larson then finds that Bolivar is worried about him, and Bolivar reveals she lost 5 partners in 2 years (though she claims that she was messing with him). Larson and Bolivar then return to El Toro's hiding place, and they get an army to infiltrate the inauguration ball of the president, which will be when they murder the president. When they reach there, Ruiz reminds Larson to kill Masovich, not the president, and Juan, disguised as a waiter under El Toro's orders, reminds him of El Toro's orders. Masovich then spots Larson and attempts to kill him, but Bolivar distracts him through dancing, while Larson meets with the president. After they dance, Bolivar and Masovich fight upstairs, while Larson forces the president to reveal his plan to kill Masovich. However, the president finds out about the plan but reveals he is depressed and hates his life. Larson tries to tell him to make a difference despite this, which will make him happy, but the president decides it is too late for him and promptly kills himself. Meanwhile, the fight between Bolivar and Masovich reaches the president's office and ends with Masovich getting shot and killed by Ruiz. Larson and Bolivar then get arrested by General Ruiz, but instead of going to jail, they are sent back to El Toro's hideout, and Juan apologizes to Larson for not believing him. Bolivar is then hired for the revolution by El Toro, and El Toro brings Larson by himself. However, once alone, El Toro, knowing Larson knows too much, prepares to kill him, but is interrupted by Cobb and Cleveland, who is asked to take him home. Larson is happy to go home but is worried about Bolivar. At the airport, Larson escapes and tries to save Bolivar, who is held captive by El Toro for information. Just as Juan is about to kill her, Larson appears armed. Larson convinces Juan to take his side, and they fight El Toro and attempt to free Bolivar. However, they are defeated, and El Toro takes Bolivar captive. Juan convinces Larson not to give up, and Larson follows them into the helicopter. After a brief struggle, Larson finally kills El Toro, who remarks that he always knew Larson was the Ghost. Larson and Bolivar then jump out of the helicopter and land in the water. They are then cornered by General Ruiz, who plans to take over the country, but first, he needs to kill Larson and Bolivar. General Ruiz is then killed by Amos, who is revealed to be the real Ghost, and promptly disappears. Six months later, Juan is now the president of Venezuela, with Bolivar watching his speech in regards to his experiences. Cobb and Cleveland, who are watching the speech as well, remark that he will be hard to control and that they hate the Ghost. Larson has become a bestselling author, having released his new book. At an interview with Katie Couric, Couric asks him whether the book was real, and Larson denies this, saying it is a work of fiction.

Legend and religious significance Image of sage thumb As per Hindu legend, during the divine wedding of Shiva and Parvathi, there was heavy crowd at Kailash. Sage Agasthya could not get a vision of the event and was praying to Shiva at this place and pleased by his devotion, Shiva appeared to him and his wife Lopamundra in Kalyana posture. The falls nearby the temple is thus called Agasthiyar Falls. As per another legend, sage Urosamar floated a set of flowers in Tamiraparani River and the first flower reached the shore at this place. The sage established a temple for Papanasanathar and worshipped the deity here. The lingam, the iconic form of Shiva in the temple is believed to an aspect of Surya, one of the planetary deities. The temple forms a series of Navagraha temples in the banks of Tamiraparani river where each of the nine planetary deities are considered to reside in one temples. The temples are classified as Nava Kailasam and the presiding deity of all the nine temples is Kailasanathar. The temple is associated with the planet Surya (Sun) and considered first in the series of the nine temples. The lingam is believed to have appeared from kala tree and is called as Mukkala Nathar. There are images of Somaskanda, Rishabaroodar and Agastya close to the image with unique sculptural representation. As per another legend, the king of celestial deities, Indra slayed a demon Dwastha, the son of Sukracharya (the Guru of Asuras) as he was performing a penance to seek superior powers against the Devas. Indra incurred Brahmatti Dosha, a sin attained for slaying the Brahmin. He roamed around a lot of places for doing penance and finally on the advise of Brihaspathi, he landed at Papanasam. Since his sin (Papam locally) was expiated in this place, it came to be known as Papanasam.

Wrapped trees take up much less space and are less likely to be damaged during shipment. The aim of the device is to replace work that previously required hand-tying individual trees, most often used at commercial nurseries. Tree balers use a funnel, through which the tree is forced, thereby compressing the branches tight to the trunk. The baler then wraps or ties the branches to maintain a compressed shape for shipment and storage. Simple machines are operated manually, usually requiring one person to push the tree through the funnel and another to wrap it. A mechanized baler does both operations and can bale over 100 trees per hour. According to the Berks-Mont News, the motorized christmas tree baler was invented in Pennsylvania in 1944. A manual baler may also keep the branches compressed by encasing the tree in a plastic netting, rather than wrapping them with twine. This type of baler is often used in retail sales of christmas trees to package the tree for transport by the customer. Manual balers do not compress trees as tightly as mechanized ones.

It is also known as the Palace Backpackers Hostel and the Palace Backpackers Memorial. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992. It was the site of a deliberately-lit fire that killed 15 backpackers in 2000.  History  The Palace Hotel was erected for Malcolm Redmond after a fire destroyed many of the buildings along the southern side of Childers' main street. The new masonry building replaced an earlier two storeyed timber hotel. The new hotel comprised public rooms on the ground floor with accommodation on the upper floor; the detached kitchen was located to the rear, with modest staff accommodation above. A large brick room opposite the kitchen may have operated as a storeroom at this time. In 1932, the hotel was acquired by Corser and Co Ltd, and again was leased. A new second storeyed accommodation wing at the rear to the building may have been added at this time. The Palace Hotel remained as an operating hotel until the 1980s, after which it was converted into a backpackers' hostel. On 23 June 2000, a fire was deliberately started at the hostel and 15 backpackers died. The Palace Hotel was rebuilt in its original early 1900s style. Queensland artist Sam Di Mauro made a long glass memorial wall that was set into the new building. Sydney artist Josonia Palaitis created a painting depicting all those who died based on photographs.Page 56 of \\"The Palace ‚Äì the story\\" by Wayne Heidrich  Description  Palace Hotel, circa 1928 The Palace Hotel is a two-storeyed rendered masonry and timber building with corrugated iron roofs. It comprises a rectangular wing with verandahs fronting Churchill St to the north (), linked by a narrow covered courtyard to a parallel wing to the south ( and s). Externally the building is complementary in materials, scale and form to other commercial buildings on Churchill St. At the same time, it rises above the predominantly single-storeyed shops on Churchill St, and is prominent in the townscape. Prior to the 2000 fire, the northern wing had ground floor public rooms, with accommodation rooms above. The south wing comprised two adjoining buildings; a service building to the west containing a kitchen to the ground floor and former staff accommodation upstairs, linked by a corridor to a ground floor function room and upstairs hotel accommodation. The Bundaberg Regional Council now operates a tourist information centre on the ground floor and the Palace Backpackers Memorial is on the upper floor.  Heritage listing  The Palace Hotel was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Palace Hotel is important in demonstrating the evolution of Queensland's history, in particular it represents evidence of the development of Childers in the early twentieth century, including the rebuilding of the south side of the main street in the early 1900s; and the form, detailing, additions to, and outbuildings of, the hotel are evidence of the evolution of a country town hotel. The Hotel is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of an early twentieth century country town hotel with its ground floor public rooms, upstairs modest accommodation, service wing, and significant contribution to a country town streetscape. It is important in exhibiting a range of aesthetic characteristics valued by the community, in particular the fine interiors, including the ground floor public rooms, and the building's significant contribution in form, scale, materials, and details to the architecturally coherent and picturesque Churchill Street streetscape and townscape.

In 2017, Netflix released a prequel to the film in the form of a television series, Suburra: Blood on Rome, set in 2008 and leading up to the events of the film. Plot In 2011, Filippo Malgradi is an Italian MP involved in a bill to change the classification of certain administrative areas; his objective is to allow a real estate project in Ostia so that it could be turned into a Las Vegas-like city. He has close relations with a local crime boss‚Äîknown as \\"Samurai\\", a former militant neo-fascist terrorist turned criminal under the cover of an unsuspecting pump station owner‚Äîwho also has deep interests in the real estate project. Samurai has privileged ties to the Vatican Bank, who will finance the project for profit. At a hotel room, Filippo fraternizes with two prostitutes, Sabrina and Jelena; Jelena, who is underage, dies of intoxication. When Filippo runs away as he attempts to dispose of the body with the other prostitute, she calls Alberto \\"Spadino\\" Anacleti to help dispose of the body by dumping it into a reservoir. Spadino is from a gypsy family who made a fortune by violent means as money lenders and debt collectors. They lent money to Sebastiano's father, a pimp who organises secret parties in his family villa for important members of the Italian high society. Sebastiano's father commits suicide after being unable to pay his debts, and Manfredi Anacleti, the patriarch of the Anacleti family, summons Sebastiano to convince him to relinquish all his property to pay for his father's debts. Spadino decides to blackmail Filippo into purchasing drugs and prostitutes from him and his family. Filippo asks Aureliano \\"Numero 8\\" Adami to intimidate Spadino, but the confrontation becomes more violent than expected, and Aureliano kills Spadino leaving Manfredi Anacleti infuriated and thirsty for revenge. Aureliano is a local thug who controls the target of the real estate project permitted by the bill in discussion. His father was also a criminal and a close friend of Samurai. He has agreed with Samurai a division in profits as long as he convinces a local small business owners to sell their properties at a bargain to Samurai. Aureliano is in love with a drug-addict named Viola. Sabrina, fearing for her life, asks Sebastiano for help, and he lets her stay at his house. She reveals the name of Spadino's killer to him, and he then decides to tell Manfredi in exchange for clemency and his family's villa. Anacleti's henchman unsuccessfully attempt to kill Aureliano. Fearful that an all-out war between Aureliano and Manfredi could threaten his real estate interests, Samurai decides to intervene between the two to bring peace. In the meantime Manfredi learns about the real estate project and also wants his share in the business. Manfredi blackmails Sebastiano to hand him over the prostitute Sabrina; in turn, Sabrina tells Manfredi Anacleti the name of the politician who is behind the project, which she reveals to be Filippo. Manfredi bursts into Filippo's apartment and takes his son as a hostage, demanding a participation in the business. Filippo, enraged, asks Samurai for protection. Samurai, who does not want to lose the transaction, attempts to reason with Aureliano but he tells Samurai that he is old and outdated. Samurai, offended by Aureliano's words and also fearful that the Vatican would back down on financing the project, decides to kill him and his henchmen. During the shooting, Viola hides and manages to escape. He decides to share the profits only with Manfredi. Manfredi goes back on his promise to return the family villa to Sebastiano, and severely beats Sebastiano. The bill is also approved, however, the body of Jelena is found on the shore, and Filippo is warned that the judiciary may investigate him. Meanwhile, Sebastiano, enraged, assaults Manfredi when he arrives home at night, beats him, and locks him in the cage of Manfredi's own ferocious pit bulls. After the approval of the bill, the Prime Minister resigns from office, which jeopardizes Filippo's parliamentary immunity, potentially leaving him at the mercy of the Judiciary. Finally, Samurai is killed while leaving his mother's apartment, by Viola.

As of October 2015, it is a member of the Austrian Traded Index (ATX), the index of the twenty largest companies traded on the Vienna stock exchange. 'Immo' is short for Immobilien, German for property.  History  C & S Immobilien Anlagen Aktiengesellschaft was established in April 1990 as a joint venture company owned by Constantia Privatbank and Bankhaus Schoeller & Co. In November 1994, C & S Immobilien Anlagen Aktiengesellschaft was merged into IMMOFINANZ, which had previously been established with the name of CPAG Immobilienvermietungs GmbH, had become a public company and been renamed C & S Realit√§ten Anlagen Aktiengesellschaft. Following the merger with C & S Immobilien Anlagen Aktiengesellschaft, the name was changed to IMMOFINANZ IMMOBILIEN ANLAGEN AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT. In 1991, the shares in C & S Immobilien Anlagen Aktiengesellschaft were admitted to the Second Regulated Market on the Vienna Stock Exchange, and from 1994 the shares of IMMOFINANZ. In 1996 the first capital increase was carried out and in the same year IMMOFINANZ shares were admitted to the Official Market on the Vienna Stock Exchange. In September 2006, the name was changed to IMMOFINANZ AG. In May 2013, the secondary listing of the shares on the Warsaw Stock Exchange took place. IMMOFINANZ is present today in Austria, Germany, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania and Poland. The core business includes the asset management and development of properties. Active portfolio management and utilisation of profitable sales opportunities ensures ongoing optimisation of the standing investment portfolio. With the sale of the entire logistics portfolio, which was completed at the beginning of February 2016, IMMOFINANZ placed its strategic focus on the office and retail asset classes in its core markets.  Financial crisis 2008  In the summer of 2008, international real estate and financial markets were hit by severe turbulence. Constantia Privatbank AG (CPAG), which, under the directorship of Petrikovics and Gertner, was responsible for the management of IMMOFINANZ, failed to react to the changed circumstances. These developments, along with poor management decisions, the correctness of which were/are the subject of criminal investigations, caused a crisis at IMMOFINANZ. In the wake of the global financial and economic crisis and the accompanying falling securities prices, IMMOFINANZ shares also came under strong pressure. For IMMOFINANZ, what was probably the most difficult phase in the history of the company up to that point began. The company today  As a commercial real estate company, IMMOFINANZ focuses on both the retail and office asset classes. In the office sector, the company ranks among the largest providers of space in many of the capital cities in its core markets. In Germany, IMMOFINANZ is constructing the new corporate head offices for trivago und Uniper in D√ºsseldorf. The IMMOFINANZ brand world was expanded during 2016 financial year to also include an international office brand named myhive. Characteristic features of myhive office buildings are: hotel inspired atmosphere, versatile infrastructure, international community, cooperation opportunities and networking as well as flexibility. In September 2016 the company Currently the third office project in the D√ºsseldorfer Medienhafen is under construction for IMMOFINANZ‚Äôs standing investment portfolio. This high- rise is designed as a multi-tenant building and will be the first office building under the IMMOFINANZ brand myhive in Germany.

VIVO! is a quality shopping center brand developed by IMMOFINANZ that focuses on fashion and entertainment. Immofinanz has been involved in a series of negotiations regarding a takeover or merger with its fellow ATX member CA Immo, also a property development company. Merger negotiations failed in 2014, as did an acrimonious takeover bid by CA Immo in spring 2015. In August 2016 IMMOFINANZ has announced, that approximately 26% of the CA IMMO shares were acquired. This acquisition was a first step towards a possible full combination of IMMOFINANZ and CA Immo by way of a statutory merger. End of February 2018, the Supervisory Board and Executive Board of IMMOFINANZ decided to continue the suspension of detailed discussions over a possible merger between CA Immo and IMMOFINANZ and to also evaluate other strategic options. In July 2018, the Supervisory Board approved the package sale of the approximately 26% investment in CA Immo to SOF-11 Starlight S.√† r.l., a member company of the Starwood Capital Group.

It was built . It is also known as Crow & Kingston and Kingston and Kingston. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 25 June 1993.  History  Kerr's Building was erected for Amelia Gertrude Overell, after a fire destroyed many of the shops along the southern side of Childers' main street. The town of Childers grew up around a railway terminus opened in 1887 to facilitate timbergetting in the Isis Scrub. What became the main street was subdivided into small allotments in the 1890s. In 1893, Frederick John Charlton and Henry Jardine Gray sold to Ellen Delaney. In 1898 the property was sold to Mrs Overell. It is not known what shops existed on the site at this time although J Delaney and later WJ Overell and Sons operated draperies in Childers. In March 1902 a fire destroyed the timber shop on the site, which was replaced by the existing masonry building. After the fire the southern side of the street was resurveyed resulting in the blocks becoming doglegged in shape. In 1907 merchants and importers, Crow and Kingston, acquired the site. After the winding up of the company of Crow and Kingston Ltd the site was purchased by cousins Jack and Bill Kingston, who operated the store as Kingston and Kingston, merchants and importers, drapers and grocers. The site remained in the Kingston family until 1974 when it was transferred to Marjorie Ann Kerr. In that year, the shop was extensively remodelled. This work included internal partitioning, boarding up of the skylight, installation of a suspended ceiling, re- concreting the floor, and the remodelling of the front awning. In 1977 the property was transferred to the present owners, who operate a real estate office. Alterations were carried out to enable the letting of various parts of the building. Existing tenants include a coffee shop and a hairdresser.  Description  Kerr's building fronts Churchill Street, the main street of Childers, to the north with rear access off Macrossan Street to the south. The single-storeyed masonry building is located within a cohesive group of predominantly 1900s shops with street awnings and decorative rendered facades. The building has a ribbed metal gabled roof with a central clerestory skylight to the east and west which has been boarded up. The rendered street facade is surmounted by a parapet with a heavy cornice and raised central pediment, supporting three urns, with EST 1902 in relief. The two shop fronts have face brick with aluminium framed glazing, with a recessed entry to the west tenancy and central corridor. An aluminium awning is slung from the facade replacing an earlier ogee awning on timber posts. Internally, the building has a central corridor with office space to the west, with a hairdresser behind, and a coffee shop to the east. Walls are rendered masonry or partition. There is a suspended ceiling throughout the building. At the rear, is an attached timber shed which is partitioned with a tenancy to the west and a store room to the east. It has a timber floor which is at a higher level than the front building, and no ceiling.  Heritage listing  Kerr's Building was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 25 June 1993 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Kerr's Building, Childers, erected , is important in demonstrating the evolution of Queensland's history, illustrating the development of Childers in the early 20th century. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. It is important in exhibiting a range of aesthetic characteristics valued by the Childers community, in particular its unity in form, scale and materials within the cohesive group of adjoining early 1900s shops; and its contribution to the streetscape of Churchill Street and to the Childers townscape.

Anekadhangavadeswarar is revered in the 7th century Tamil Saiva canonical work, the Tevaram, written by Tamil saint poets known as the nayanars and classified as Paadal Petra Sthalam, the 275 temples reverred in the canon. The temple has two daily rituals at various times from 5:30 a.m. to 8 p.m., and three yearly festivals on its calendar, of which the Thirukarthikai during (November - December) and Mahashivarathri during February - March being the most prominent. The temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamil Nadu. Etymology and legend thumb According to legend, Vinayaka, the son of Shiva, established Anegabeswarar in the form a Lingam (an iconic representation of Shiva). Anegabeswarar is believed to have killed the demon Iraniyapura king Kesi and arranged for the marriage of his daughter Vallabai with Vinayaga. Kubera, the king of wealth is also believed to have worshipped Angebeswarar. There are two Anegathangavadham temples, one in the North and one in the South. This temple is referred as Kachi Angegathangavadham to differentiate it from the northern shrine. Tirugnana Sambandar, a 7th-century Tamil Saivite poet, venerated Chandramouleeswarar in ten verses in Tevaram, compiled as the First Tirumurai. Sundarar, venerated Anegaveswarar in 10 verses in Tevaram, compiled as the Seventh Tirumurai. As the temple is revered in Tevaram, it is classified as Paadal Petra Sthalam, one of the 276 temples that find mention in the Saiva canon. Sundarar mentions that Shiva prefers to reside at this most happening place. Architecture Kanchipuram district The temple is located in Kanchipuram, on the way from the town to the Kanchi Kailasanathar Temple. Anekadhangavadeswarar temple complex has a single prakarams (outer courtyard) and a small rajagopuram (gateway tower) facing North. The central shrine faces east and holds the image of Anekadhangavadeswarar (Shiva) in the form of lingam made of granite. As in other temples in Kanchipuram, there is no separate shrine of Parvathi as it is believed that Kamakshi of Kanchipuram is the common Parvathi shrine for all Shiva temples. The granite images of Nandi (the bull and vehicle of Shiva) is located axial to the sanctum. As in other Shiva temples of Tamil Nadu, the first precinct or the walls around the sanctum of Anekadhangavadeswarar has images of Dakshinamurthy (Shiva as the Teacher), Durga (warrior-goddess) and Chandikeswarar (a saint and devotee of Shiva). There is a separate shrine for Periya Vinayaga. The temple precinct is surrounded by granite walls. Worship and religious practises The temple priests perform the puja (rituals) during festivals and on a daily basis. The temple rituals are performed two times a day; Kalasanthi at 8:00 a.m. and Sayarakshai at 6:00 p.m. Each ritual comprises four steps: abhisheka (sacred bath), alangaram (decoration), naivethanam (food offering) and deepa aradanai (waving of lamps) for both Anekadhangavadeswarar and Manonmani Amman. There are weekly rituals like ' (Monday) and ' (Friday), fortnightly rituals like pradosham and monthly festivals like amavasai (new moon day), kiruthigai, pournami (full moon day) and sathurthi. The Thirukarthikai during (November - December) and Maha Shivratri during February - March are the most prominent festivals celebrated in the temple.

Ian Broun Sprague (1920‚Äì1994) was an Australian twentieth century studio potter, ceramic sculptor and graphic artist. Delayed by the Second World War and a false start in architecture, he spent (broadly) his forties adapting Australian domestic pottery to a Japanese aesthetic of contemplative use;\\"The eloquent Taoist anthem of truth to materials, to clay, to glaze, to technique\\", John Teschendorff, \\"Introduction to the Ceramics Collection\\" in his fifties as a sculptor in two and three dimensional pottery; his sixties and seventies making landscape works on paper. Early life Sprague was born in Geelong, Victoria in 1920. He was the sixth and last child of Leslie Sprague, a wealthy grazier and Marion Broun, Armidale-born descendant of the Scottish Broun baronets.Broun is pronounced Brewin. The children were Audrey (later Mrs Edge), Edgar, Dirleen (later Mrs Molesworth), Zelma (later Mrs King), Mervyn and Ian. He was educated at Geelong Grammar.Kenneth Hood, \\"Introduction\\" in Trained as an architectural draughtsman, Sprague spent the Second World War in the AIF in New Guinea as a signals officer.National Archives of Australia series B883, service number VX110751 barcode 6095705 After the war he went to the University of Melbourne and completed an architecture degree in 1950. Other sources say 1948. But he found the next ten years in architects' offices in Melbourne and London tedious and unsatisfying. Sprague was 6 ft. 1 in. tall with fair hair and blue eyes. He appeared at Government House parties and as best man at fashionable weddings, but he never married. On a driving holiday in Scotland in 1957, he had a car accident which put him in hospital for five months. One knee was permanently damaged and a frequent source of pain. His surgeon suggested he restore the strength of his arms by taking up a craft. Pottery Lidded storage jar, Tenmoku glazed; 14cm x 15cm; Ian Sprague mark. Sprague attended the London Central School of Arts and Crafts 1958‚Äì1960. He spent two months at the David Leach pottery in Devon. He returned to Australia in February 1962, planning to make ethical pots in the Anglo‚ÄìJapanese tradition founded by Bernard Leach, David's father. Sprague bought a 15-acre estate in Upper Beaconsfield, Victoria. :I had this whole setup clearly in mind. I wanted to live out of Melbourne. I wanted to have animals, some land, and to be completely free to do what I wanted. On the estate he set up a pottery, designed and built a new house nearbyRobin Welch, \\"Mungeribar Pottery\\" in and renovated an existing five-room cottage. The house was made of \\"brick and timber, low stramit steel roof, cedar windows, wooden floors, slate, cork, bagged white brick interior.\\" Personal communication from a Sprague nephew. From England he had imported a Homer kiln capable of the high temperatures needed to make stoneware and porcelain rather than earthenware, and a Boulton's cone-driven wheel and pugmill. The equipment was on a commercial scale but devoted to studio work. The pottery was called Mungeribar: \\"red clay\\" in the local Aboriginal (Woiwurrung) language. :‚Ä¶ we finally arrived at a stoneware body mixing a local fireclay with commercial red clay, china clay and ball clay ‚Ä¶ it works well and reduces to a red-brown with lighter speckling ‚Ä¶ Most of the glazes we use are, as a result, in the darker earthy colours but speckled light greys and ochres are also possible. The Mungeribar Pottery's mark is a Macdonald's em impressed; Sprague's personal mark is a capital I over a horizontal separator and the Morse code for S‚Äîthree dots. Some pots are signed \\"IanS\\". Drawings and paintings are signed \\"Ian Sprague\\"; work signed simply \\"Sprague\\" is generally by his nephew Leslie. Sprague had met and liked the potter and Slade School technician Robin Welch (b. 1936) in England. He paid for Welch and his family to come to Mungeribar in 1962 so Welch could help him set up a fully professional pottery. The Welches returned to England in 1965. In the October 1965 issue of Pottery in Australia, Sprague described their successes and failures in setting up the pottery. The description and plans are so detailed as to amount to a specification for would-be imitators. Sprague produced a full range of functional domestic pottery from 1964 to 1980. In 1964 he established the Craft Centre in South Yarra, \\"a display centre and exhibition gallery for Australia's highest standard craft work\\". Sprague thus had control of every step of production from mixing the clay to passing wrapped pots over the counter. The Centre was owned and stocked entirely by him, and he travelled all over Australia in search of the best pottery, textiles, glassware, woodwork and jewellery. The opening exhibition showed the pottery of Robin Welch. Sprague sold the Centre in 1967, but soon started a campaign for a government funded centre, eventually established as the Meat Market Craft Centre in North Melbourne. In 1971 Sprague became president of the recently established Craft Association of Victoria. Dismayed by the quality of teaching in art schools and technical colleges, he ran many workshops around the country on the textural treatment of clay. :I feel that one should contribute something for the common good, although often a tremendous amount of one's creative work-time is used ‚Ä¶ Establishing and running a property, collecting paintings by Australian artists, pop and classical records and continually entertaining friends and visitors has not left me enough time for my own work.

Two ash-glazed storage jars, one with lugs, mid-1970s; 15cm x 10cm (with lugs), 13cm x 11cm (without); both with Ian Sprague mark. On one view, Sprague never produced great quantities of work himself; he was a self- effacing craftsman, not inclined to promote or exhibit his work. Yet he fired about 1,500 domestic pots of his own each year The reasoning: when Greenaway joined, they doubled the firings to make three thousand pots a year. So Sprague's share was 1,500 a year and scores of them are now in public collections.Leaver, page 17. :The brown stonewares, the nicely formed functional breadcrocks, teapots, fruit platters and teacups and saucers ‚Ä¶ made his a household name among the 1970s cognoscenti. Victor Greenaway was his apprentice 1969‚Äì73. (Greenaway's mark in his Mungeribar years was an impressed capital G.) Greenaway eventually became Sprague's friend and occasional manager. He considered Sprague :a gentleman potter ‚Ä¶ exceptionally skilled at his craft ‚Ä¶ For Welch, the greatest pleasure was to see shelves full of multiples of his own work but for Sprague, his objective was to place the hand-made piece of pottery in the house ‚Äî making cups and saucers and beautiful objects to use and feel and generally appreciate. In 1973 Sprague excised two acres of Mungeribar to provide Greenaway with land for a house of his own. The other apprentices at Mungeribar were Grattan Burley (for six months), Christopher Sanders (1976‚Äì78), who became a lifelong friend, and Trevor Hanby (1978‚Äì80). After 14 years of hands-on pottery making, Sprague ceded to Hanby the job of developing a full range of pots to be sold under the Mungeribar mark.Trevor Hanby, \\"Mungeribar Pottery\\" in In 1965 the famous Japanese potter Sh≈çji Hamada had made a range of pots at Mungeribar; they are now in the Hamilton Gallery. The Japanese potter Tatsuzo Shimaoka worked at Mungeribar in 1972. Throughout the 1970s such international masters as Harry Davis, Ian Auld, Fujiwara Yu and Michael Cardew visited. Non-functional pottery Celadon-glazed pottery bas-relief of his dog Sprint 1979; Ian Sprague mark. In the mid-1970s Sprague, following Robin Welch, produced a series of sculptures by adding anthropomorphic features to spindly thrown pots. Bearing such names as Critic, Totem and Warrior, they look like excavated chthonic mannikins. Ovoid forms originated on the wheel but were beaten and scraped into expressive asymmetry and ornamented with clay disks and straps. A large group of these was shown at Leveson Street Gallery, North Melbourne in December 1980. Entry 205C80. From 1973 at the latest he specialised in fireclay panels for architectural use as wall plaques or free- standing sculptures (Littlemore's Nine Artist Potters first edition of 1973 has photos of six of them). Later examples have a spine of coloured glass in clay wells. :Sprague produced his wall panels by cutting them from fireclay blocks, heating and scraping them, and applying bold simplified motifs. These rugged clay surfaces were often finished simply by pouring a strong solution of salted water on to their surfaces ‚Ä¶ [firing] resulting in a warm toasted surface effect.Christopher Sanders, Preface to :The hand-modelled clay panels ‚Ä¶ combine expressive abstract forms and a rare understanding of the modulation of two dimensional relief sculpture. Generally the panels were in groups of three, but installations of 8 panels (two by four), 42 (seven by six) or 27 (three by nine) were made, notably for the Modernist Beaumaris house of sculptor and portrait painter Shirley Hannan. Hannan was one of many clients who became admiring friends.Personal communication, Relton Leaver. Single panels were sometimes glazed bas-relief sculptures. Sprague laid out a design of 20,000 ceramic tiles in the Fitzroy Gardens, Melbourne in 1979 to form a \\"people's pathway\\". Four years later he contributed a \\"cave seat\\" to another community art-work, the Terracotta Mural Garden at Benalla, Victoria. Later life Sand dune drawing, Ian Sprague 1991; unsigned and undated. Made below Shirley Hannan's beach house inside Bournda National Park, NSW. By 1981 Mungeribar was too onerous and too cold for Sprague's health. He sold the Upper Beaconsfield estate and moved to a house and studio he had bought at Mooney Mooney on the Hawkesbury River. He made pots and sculptures in a small pottery as well as works on paper. These include lithographs and monoprints. There are many drawings of the river, boats, the rocky escarpments. Other drawings are of his whippet Sprint.Personal communication, a Sprague nephew. In 1992 he moved to a smaller house and studio at Sunshine Beach north of Noosa, Queensland. He died there two years later. Mungeribar had been consumed by a firestorm on Ash Wednesday 1983. Reputation Ian Sprague: studio potter 1920‚Äì1994, a retrospective exhibition curated by Relton Leaver, was held at the Victorian State Craft Collection Gallery in 1995. The review in The Age, headed \\"Master potter hailed\\", wrote of his \\"legendary contribution to contemporary ceramics\\". Examples of Sprague's work are held by the National Gallery of Australia, Canberra; the National Gallery of Victoria; the Victorian Ceramic Group; the Powerhouse Museum, Sydney; the Ian Potter Museum of Art. Photos A photo of Sprague by Mark Strizic in the collection of the National Gallery of Victoria is available online as Ian B. Sprague (1960s). It provides a rare glimpse of him working on a ceramic sculpture.

He collected plants in Europe and North America. Family Melvill was born at Hampstead, London, on 1 July 1845. He was a grandson of British administrator in India, Sir James Cosmo Melvill (1792‚Äì1861), his father being the latter's second son, also James Cosmo Melvill (1821‚Äì1880), onetime assistant Under-Secretary of state for India. His mother was Eliza Jane, daughter of Alfred Hardcastle of Hatcham House, Surrey. Melvill married on 30 July 1874, Bertha, daughter of George C. Dewhurst of Lymm, Cheshire and Aberuchill Castle, Perthshire, Scotland. The couple had two sons and four daughters. Education and career Melvill was educated at Harrow School, and Trinity College, Cambridge, which he entered in 1864. He graduated Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) in 1864, and Master (M.A.) in 1871. in later life he became an honorary Doctor of Sciences (D.Sc.) from Manchester University in 1908. His natural history interests were never professional. He went into business in the Lancashire cotton industry, first in the cotton merchant business of his uncle Edward Hardcastle (who was also MP for South East Lancashire and later Salford North) from 1871, then in 1887Caradoc and Severn Valley Field Club Transactions for 1930, Volume VIII, No 4, page 172. became director of the firm of Messrs G. and R. Dewhurst Ltd, of Manchester, Preston and London, East India and China cotton merchants. He retired in 1904 but resumed his directorship of the latter firm because of the enlistments of his sons and other staff, during the time of the First World War. Mevill also became a governor of Manchester University and Manchester Grammar School. He was President of the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society from 1897 to 1899. Politically he was a supporter of the Conservative Party but despite posthumous claims he was onetime Member of Parliament for Salford Southsection History of Botanical Recording.Botanical Society of the British Isles Herbaria United he neither served in Parliament nor contested the Salford seats as a parliamentary candidate at general elections. In 1904 he settled in Shropshire at Meole Hall, Meole Brace near Shrewsbury. In that county he became a governor of the Royal Salop Infirmary, an honorary curator of Shrewsbury Museum and president of the Caradoc and Severn Valley Field Club. Incapacitated by a fall which dislocated his shoulder, he died at Meole Hall on 4 November 1929 and was buried on 7 November in Shrewsbury General Cemetery in Longden Road. Natural history activities Melvill collected shells from the age of eight and ultimately possessed a collection representing 25,500 species of mollusc, including a thousand new species from the Persian Gulf and South Africa. His botanical collection, which included specimens assembled by other botanists, was one of the largest private herbaria in the country and was kept in a special building in his garden at Meole Hall. It was said to amount to three-quarters of the known plants in the world, especially grasses and ferns, most of which he gave to Manchester University. He presented that of British ferns and grasses to Harrow School, a collection later transferred to the National Botanic Garden of Wales.

It was designed by F H Faircloth and built in 1902. It is also known as Diamond Centre Jeweller and Robinson's Newsagency. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  The former Lloyd's Barber Shop is one of a row of conjoining shops situated between the Palace Hotel and Kerr's Buildings. It and the adjoining bakery were built in 1902 for Alfred Gorrie to the design of Bundaberg architect FW Faircloth, following a fire that destroyed most of the south side of the main street of Childers. Faircloth was responsible for much of the new building following the fire, the effects of which transformed the appearance of Childers. Childers is located in what was once the heart of the Isis Scrub. Following logging of the dense Scrub in the 1870s, Childers was promoted in the 1880s by Maryborough interests as an agricultural district. The land in the immediate vicinity of the present town of Childers was surveyed in 1882 into farm blocks. There was no official town survey; Childers developed following private subdivision at the railhead of the 1887 Isis railway line from Isis Junction. This was opened on 31 October 1887, and was intended principally to facilitate the transport of timber from the scrub. The coming of the railway not only promoted the development of the town of Childers; it also proved the catalyst for the establishment of a sugar industry in the district in the late 1880s. At the opening of the railway to Childers, Robert Cran, owner of Maryborough's Yengarie mill, announced that he would erect a double crushing juice mill at Doolbi, to supply his mill at Yengarie. This was completed in 1890, with the juice being brought in railway tankers from the Isis. Further expansion of the sugar industry in the Isis was closely related to the activities of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, which erected a central crushing mill in the district 1893-94, and began crushing in 1895. By 1895, at least three other mills had been established in the Isis, with another two under construction, and Childers had emerged as the flourishing centre of a substantial sugar-growing district. 1902 was a very dry year and Childers had no fire brigade. On 23 March, a catastrophic fire swept through the south side of the main street in town, where virtually all the buildings were timber and closely built. Those stores destroyed were: S Oakley, bootmaker; FD Cooper, commission agent; R Graham, fruiterer; ME Gosley, tailor; Foley, hairdresser; M Redmond, Palace Hotel; WB Jones, auctioneer; W Couzens, fruiterer; H Newman, general storekeeper; WJ Overell and Son, general merchants; P Christensen, cabinet maker; W Hood, stationer; T Gaydon, chemist; W Lloyd, hairdresser; Mrs Dunne, fruiterer; Federal Jewellery Company; Dunn Bros, saddlers; H Wegner, bootmaker. The Bundaberg architect F H Faircloth was engaged to redesign many of the replacement buildings and called the first tenders in June 1902. Frederic Herbert (Herb) Faircloth was born in Maryborough in 1870 and was a pupil of German-trained Bundaberg architect Anton Hettrich. Faircloth set up his own practice in Bundaberg in 1893 and was very successful, eventually being responsible for the design of almost every major building in Bundaberg. He was also to have a major effect on the appearance and character of Childers. Prior to the fire, photographs show a timber building on this site, which may have been Overell's Drapery. Following the fire, this land was purchased by Alfred Gorrie. A row of 5 shops were built, two of which were owned by Gorrie and the remaining three were owned by chemist Thomas Gaydon and occupied as a single tenancy by a hardware store. Like other post-fire buildings in Childers this set of shops were masonry rather than timber, a choice no doubt influenced by the fire, and were elegant single story buildings with large glass shop fronts. Striped ogee awnings across the footpath were supported by decorative posts with cast iron infill. Each shop had a separate roof, some lit by lanterns and the individual tenancies were also marked by the visual separation of the facades by the use of classic revival pediments, urns, and balustrades. Gorrie occupied one of his shops himself as a baker and confectioner. This shop was occupied by hairdresser and barber William Lloyd, whose premises had been destroyed in the fire. The shop was leased to another hairdresser in 1930 and then to other commercial tenants. In 1941 Gorrie died and the property passed to Edward Gorrie who sold it to William and Annie McKay in 1958. It was purchased in 1976 by Earle and June Robinson who subdivided the property so that each shop was on a separate title. It was used for many years as a newsagency, although it is currently a jewellers.  Description  The former barber shop is now a jewellers and is one shop within a row of five single story masonry shops built conjointly on the south side of Churchill Street, Childers' main street adjoining the Palace Hotel. It has a corrugated iron roof concealed by a parapet and in common with the other shops in this group and other buildings on this side of the street, has a classical revival pediment with a balustraded parapet topped by urns. The interior is lit by a lantern in the roof and appears to have changed little. The shopfront is also much as original and is shaded by an ogee profile corrugated iron awning to the street supported by posts, although the cast iron valance is no longer present.  Heritage listing  The former Lloyd's Barber Shop was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. It is important in demonstrating the evolution of Queensland's history representing evidence of the development of Childers in the early twentieth century in particular, the rebuilding of the south side of the main street in the early 1900s following the 1902 fire. Together with much of the southern side of Childers main street it provides clear evidence of the impact of fire on Queensland towns where adequate water supply and fire services were lacking. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. It is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of early 1900s country town masonry commercial buildings, in particular the awnings, shop fronts, lanterns, and overall form. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. It contributes to the picturesque townscape of Churchill Street which is both remarkably architecturally coherent and intact The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. It has a special association with the life and work of Bundaberg architect FH Faircloth who was responsible for much of the appearance of the town of Childers in the twentieth century.

It was built from to . It is also known as HR Lassig butchers, Leatherarts, and Wrench and Thompson butchers. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  Wrench and Thompson butchers shop in Childers, 1907 The Old Butcher's Shop is located just off the main street of Childers and near to the Federal Hotel. The complex includes the former brick butcher's shop, an adjoining timber shop and a dwelling act the rear. It served several generations in Childers as a butcher's shop. Following logging of the dense Isis Scrub in the 1870s, Childers, in the heart of the scrub, was promoted in the 1880s by Maryborough interests, as an agricultural district. The land in the immediate vicinity of the present town of Childers was surveyed in 1882 into farm blocks. There was no official town survey and Childers developed following private subdivision of land at the railhead of the 1887 Isis railway line from Isis Junction. This was opened on 31 October 1887 and was intended principally to facilitate the transport of timber from the scrub. The coming of the railway not only promoted the development of the town of Childers; it also proved the catalyst for the establishment of a sugar industry in the district in the late 1880s. At the opening of the railway to Childers, Robert Cran, owner of Maryborough's Yengarie mill, announced that he would erect a double crushing juice mill at Doolbi, to supply his mill at Yengarie. This was completed in 1890, with the juice being brought in railway tankers from the Isis district. Further expansion of the sugar industry in the Isis was closely related to the activities of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, which erected a central crushing mill in the district 1893-94, and began crushing in 1895. By 1895, at least three other mills had been established in the Isis, with another two under construction, and Childers had emerged as the flourishing centre of a substantial sugar-growing district. The land on which the shops are situated was originally granted as a selection to Ernest Dyne but changed hands before being extensively subdivided into town lots in 1892. William Ashby, a hotelier, bought subdivisions 1 and 3. It is not known if he built on this land and subdivided and sold the section on which the butchers shop stands in 1905, before building the Federal Hotel on the corner of Churchill and North Streets in 1907. This area of North Street appears to have developed as an offshoot of the nearby shopping area in the main street and was no doubt assisted by the presence of the hotel. The facade of the Old Butcher's shop bears the date \\"1896\\" which may refer to the establishment of either a butchery on this site, or of the establishment in trade of the proprietor. Given the similarities between this building and those erected in the main street after the 1902 fire, the building may well have been built during this era of reconstruction in the town rather than in 1896. although the timber building adjoining it may well have been an earlier butcher. In 1905 the property was transferred to Eliza Wrench, wife of Robert Wrench who is listed in the Post Office Directory as manager of Childers Cash Butchery, although a 1907 photograph of the shop shows the name of the proprietors as Wrench and Thompson. Wrench had been a butcher in Childers since 1896, though by 1907 he was also acting as an insurance agent and may have run the New Zealand Insurance agency in the timber building. He eventually worked only as an insurance and commission agent and valuer. The land was divided into two and that with the butcher shop complex was sold in 1911 to Hermann Lassig, also a butcher. His change to the signage of the building consisted simply of substituting his name for that of Wrench & Thompson and removing the New Zealand Insurance hoarding. The front of the shop in this and the earlier photograph show an open front to the shop. It is not known when the closed and tiled shopfront was installed. In 1915 the property was purchased by Daniel and Peter O'Regan, Daniel having been a butcher in Childers since at least 1900. In 1921 it was bought by the partnership of Robert Gant, William Branch, Richard Webb and William Webb and also run as a butchery. In 1928 it was purchased by Alexander Adie, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Isis Central Sugar Mill, who was to own five butchers shops. Adie died in 1940 and in 1944 the business became Stehbens Bros butchers, then Frank Slack, Butcher, before becoming Kings Meats Pty Ltd in 1962. Mr King was the last butcher to operate from the shop after a continuity of use that lasted over 60 years. The shop is said to have been used as an iceworks and was empty for some time before being purchased in 1976 by Leonard and Cheryl Derley who used it to establish a leathergoods and pottery business and several government agencies. The shop was bought in 1988 by Anita Campden-Main who opened it as a museum and tourist attraction. The property was sold in 1996.  Description  Interior of J.R.

The site comprises masonry butchers shop and adjoining timber shop with a dwelling at the rear. The main shop is constructed of brick and is a rectangular building with its long axis at right angles to the street. It has a gabled roof clad with corrugated iron and concealed by a parapet featuring a raised central section with an arched top, similar to shops in Churchill street. The shopfront is divided into two tenancies and has large display windows between and flanking the two panelled doors. It is shaded by an awning supported on two pairs of posts and is tiled at street level. The tiles are a glossy moss green with panels of geometric and stylised floral tiles in reds and greens beneath each window. Beside the windows at each side of the shop front are inset white feature tiles painted with the images of a bull and a ram in blue. The adjoining shop is a simple timber building with an exposed stud frame and corrugated iron gabled roof. It also has a corrugated iron street awning which is supported on plain timber posts. Behind the shop is a timber dwelling which was not inspected. The butcher's shop includes fittings and furniture from its use as a butcher.  Heritage listing  The Old Butcher's shop was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. As a handsome masonry commercial building in the commercial centre of Childers, the shop illustrates the change which took place in many Queensland towns as the simple timber and corrugated iron buildings of frontier settlement were replaced by more sophisticated premises as towns became stable and prosperous. The timber shop which adjoins it underlines this contrast. It is also an example of the fashion for building in brick in many country towns following the terrible fires which devastated commercial centres during the \\"King\\" drought of the early 1900s, caused by a combination of closely built timber structures and a water supply insufficient for fire-fighting. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Queensland's history. It contains much of its original equipment which has the potential to provide information on the way in which meat was processed for public sale and the equipment available to butchers, such as sausage machines, brine pumps, presses and mincers. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The old Butcher's Shop complex in Childers is an exceptionally good and intact example of this kind of premises. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The shops, particularly the masonry butcher's shop, which is constructed in a style similar to the rows of shops in Churchill Street, make a major contribution to the character of the streetscape of Childers.

She had accommodation for about 150 passengers, exclusive of third class passengers. On 27 January 1886 she was on a voyage from Southampton to St Malo when the bottom of her high-pressure cylinder blew out, scalding one of the firemen, and disabling the ship about 15 miles north of Guernsey. The tugs Rescue and Alert were sent from Guernsey to render her assistance. In 1910, 21 miles south of the Needle‚Äôs lighthouse, she collided with the Norwegian ship Sophie, of Lavinia, bound from Caleta Buena for Hamburg loaded with nitrate. The Sophie was struck on the starboard quarter and started to flood. In January 1911 she collided with her sister ship during a dense fog off the Needles and on 14 January 1914 the Hamburg-Amerika Company‚Äôs tender Ariadne collided with her.

In 2011, it was reported that the local industry only has a 0.02% market share of the $90 billion global industry. The majority of the game development industry is focused on outsourcing to foreign companies rather than creation of local content. According to the Game Developers Association of the Philippines (GDAP), there are about 4,000 professionals representing about 60 companies involved in the game development industry as of 2013. The Philippines' primary competitors in this field are China, Singapore, Malaysia and Vietnam. The first Filipino-developed commercial computer game was Anito: Defend a Land Enraged which was released in November 2003. 2 months prior to the release of Anito, in September 2003, a free and open source Solitaire card game named Drac was also released by Rico Zu√±iga, which makes Drac the first Filipino-developed computer game and game development framework.

Controversies and issues=1981 ban on video games On November 19, 1981 President Ferdinand Marcos banned video games in the country through a presidential decree, making the Philippines the first nation to ban video games. The decree was a response to complaints from parents and educators who alleged that games such as Space Invaders and Asteroids were detrimental to youth morals, viewing them as a \\"destructive social enemy\\" and existing \\"to the detriment of the public interest\\". Marcos also decreed the ban of pinball machines, slot machines, and other similar gaming devices. Filipinos were given two weeks to either destroy their video games and devices or surrender the materials to the police and army. Violators had to pay a fine amounting to about $600 and face 6 months to 1 year of prison. Playing video games in the country went underground. The ban was effectively lifted following the 1986 People Power Revolution. Localized ban on Defense of the Ancients While no video games have been banned nationwide since 1986, at least one title, Defense of the Ancients, has been banned at a barangay in Dasmari√±as, Cavite following complaints of delinquency and two murder incidents involving youths in the area resulting from brawls related to the game. Copyright infringement Unauthorized distribution of video games is a complex issue in the Philippines. Despite legislation against copyright violation, enforcement and cultural factors remain an obstacle in the country. Bootleg video games, along with warez, contribute to the underground economy of the country where video gaming is a popular form of entertainment among Filipino families. The inability of many Filipino families to afford video game software and hardware at legitimate prices leads them to turn to unlicensed goods. The Optical Media Board in cooperation with the police enforces intellectual rights law in the country.

They are not to be confused with another group of the same name, also from the Bay area, but from Marin County that had a more folk rock orientation and comprised the basis of the later group the Sons of Champlin. This group was known for a more primal 60s punk sound, which in spite of their lack of wider success, have come to the attention of garage rock collectors and enthusiasts over the years. Their work has appeared on several compilations. The band was initially formed as the Avengers, a surf rock outfit, by students at El Camino High School in Sacramento, California in 1965. Their membership included Ed Dunk on vocals, Don Wright and Hal Hanefield on rhythm guitar, Larry McGlade on lead guitar, Brent MacIntosh on bass, and Jack Androvich on drums. Eventually the group changed their name to \\"Six and the Single Girl\\" which was a homage to a singing diva at El Camino High whom the members fancied an association with, but later changed the name to the Opposite Six, which, itself a pun, grew out of their prior moniker. The band went to local media personality, Bill Rase's primitive studio to record a single featuring the self-pened \\"I'll Be Gone,\\" written by guitarist Don Wright which was a ragged Kinks and Rolling Stones- influenced number featuring Ed Dunk's nasal vocal and was backed with \\"Why Did You Lie?\\" The record was released on the Spectre label in January, 1966. The song became a big hit locally. After graduating from high school, the Opposite Six broke up. Don Wright later cut another version of \\"Why Did You Lie?\\" backed with \\"Draft Dodger Blues\\" on Spectre in the Fall of 1966 with former bandmates Brent MacIntosh and Jack Androvich, credited as Don Wright and the Head Set.

He came to wider prominence as a delegate from Mainz to the negotiations at M√ºnster that eventually ended the Thirty Years' War. Life=Provenance, early years and family Born in 1598, Nikolaus Georg von Reigersberg was the son of a butcher, also called Georg von Reigersberg, in Diedenhofen and his wife Anna Gudnacht. The younger Georg von Reigersberg studied Jurisprudence at Cologne and Mainz, concluding his studies with a double doctorate in canon and civil law. His first marriage, which took place on 24 August 1624, was to Maria Salome von Faber, the daughter of the cup- bearer Nikolaus Faber. She died in 1639, by which point the marriage had produced four recorded sons and one daughter. His second marriage was to the heiress Eva Maria von M√ºnster, who brought the Collenburg into the family. The Collenburg (hill), and a century later the Schloss Fechenbach, would become the family seat for their heirs. Career His professional career began in 1622 with a court appointment as secretary in the electoral chancelry of Mainz. From 1624 till 1651 he also served as Schulthei√ü in Aschaffenburg.Carsten Pollnick: Aschaffenburger Stadtoberh√§upter W√ºrzburg: Volksblatt Verlagsgesellschaft mbH 1983, He also presided as inquisitor in witch trials at Aschaffenburg, Gro√ükrotzenburg, W√∂rth und M√∂nchberg. However, he was relieved of his inquisitorial responsibilities in 1628 following allegations that he was using the office to enrich himself. In 1635 Elector- Archbishop Anselm Casimir Wambold von Umstadt appointed him to the nobility. Between 1640 and 1643 he was a member of the Elector-Archbishop's privy council, and Chancellor of the Archbishopric of Mainz. The size of von Reigersberg's footprint on history results not merely from a succession of court appointments and meetings with princes, but also from his participation in the peace negotiations at M√ºnster and Osnabr√ºck in March 1648 which led to the Peace of Westphalia and the end of thirty years of exceptionally destructive warfare. As the representative of Johann Philipp von Sch√∂nborn, who had taken over as Elector-Archbishop of Mainz in 1647, on 24 October 1648 von Reigersberg placed his signature on the treaty document. His was the first of the signatures placed by or on behalf of the Prince-electors. His contribution was prominently acknowledged by Emperor Ferdinand. In 1651, his politics being no longer in tune with the times, he requested to be released from his chancellorship. He died in 1652 and was buried in The Church of Our Lady in Aaschafenburg.

A list of 21 vehicles, had been released initially but that number quickly changed as other car makers joined in on the offer. The auto loan ceiling had been set at 250 million rials ($7120 at market exchange rate) with an interest rate of between 16-18%. The payback period is a maximum seven years or 84 installments. On November 15, 2015, The Central Bank of Iran sent a notice to automakers and dealers, asking them to watch for the limited number of car loans available. In a letter to the Ministry of Industries, Mine and Trade posted on its website on Saturday, the CBI reminded auto industry officials that the total amount set for auto loan scheme can cover no more than 110,000 vehicles. By the end of the day the loan ceiling had been reached making it the fast rise in sales in any car industries history. The loan is notable as it was the first and only financial offering by the Rouhani administration to offer a long term fixed-interest loan to the majority of car buyers. It is also notable that within the space of four days 110,000 car buyers put their name down for the item. The announcement indicates that starting Monday November 9, buyers of Iranian-produced cars will be eligible for a loan of up to 80 percent of the purchase price. Prior to the short term loan, vehicle production in Iran declined by 12.2% in the first seven months of the Iranian fiscal year (ended October 22) compared with the same period of last year. A total of 284,472 passenger and heavy-duty vehicles were produced during the period. Statistics released by the Ministry of Industries, Mining and Trade show that during the seven months, vehicle production has declined at the country‚Äôs top two vehicle manufacturing companies, Iran Khodro Co. and SAIPA, by 14.4% and 13.4% respectively, Eghtesad News wrote.  Fallout of Loan  After the abrupt end of the designated 6-month period, which happened under 7 days many would be car buyers were shocked to discover the entire loan amount ended so quickly. However, the government stated that auto loans would become part of a wider pack of financial policies over the course of the administration. One writer covering the issue for the Financial Tribune noted at the time; When the loan came to a screeching halt incredibly early, everybody was taken by surprise, including the government officials.

The prayer is part of the liturgy used in pilgrimages to the shrine of Husayn in Karbala. Muhammad al-Baqir, the fifth Shia Imam, recommended reciting Ziyarat Ashura on Ashura while facing Karbala, as a symbolic visit to the shrine. Etymology In Islam, a ziyƒÅrah () is a visit to the tomb of a saint or other holy person, such as Prophet Muhammad or Imam Husayn. ‚ÄòƒÄsh≈´rƒÅ‚Äô (), literally \\"tenth\\", is a holiday and a day of grief for the Muslims, falling on 10 Muharram of the Islamic calendar. The Martyrdom of Husayn ibn Ali and his family members and his associate (72 Martyrs) during the Battle of Karbala is commemorated on this day. Sources First page of Ziyarat Ashura Ziyarat Ashura is attributed to Muhammad al-Baqir, the fifth Shia Imam, who transmitted it to his followers. The prayer is found in sacred hadith narrated in particular by Shaykh Tusi in Misbah al-Mutahajjid and by Ibn Qulawayh in Kamil al-Ziyarat: The prayer is also found in Bihar al-Anwar by Allamah al-Majlisi and Mafatih al-Jinan by Abbas Qumi. Contents Ziyarat Ashura contains concepts like tabarra (dissociating from those who oppose God, oppose the Islamic prophet Muhammad or oppose his family), tawalla (loving the Ahl al-Bayt), self-sacrifice for society, and never surrendering to tyranny and oppression. Further reading The following commentaries are available: *Jannat al-Sarur fi Kayfiyat Tahqiq Ziyarat al-Ashura () by Sheikh Ali Esterabadi Tehrani *Tadhkirat al-Za'arin () by Sayyed Abu Hassan bin Mohammad Tabatabai Saravi *The Shifa al-Sudur by Mirza Abul Fazl Tehrani *Manuscripts of commentary on Ziyarat of Ashura by Muhammad Baqir Majlisi  Dua Alqamah  Dua Alqamah (Persian: ÿØÿπÿß€å ÿπŸÑŸÇŸÖŸá ) is the title of the supplication recited after Ziyarat Ashura by Shia Muslims. It is attributed to Muhammad al-Baqir, the fifth Shia Imam, who transmitted it to his followers. Alqamah is referred to one of companion of Ja'far al-Sadiq, the sixth Imam of the Shia, named Alqamah. According to the tradition in Mafatih al-Janan (Keys to the Heavens), Abbas Qumi believed this supplication is in honor of one companion of Ja'far al-Sadiq, named Safwan. So, the original name of the supplication is Safwan. According to the Mafatih al-Janan, Abbas Qumi narrated the Alqamah prayer from Muhammad al-Baqir, the fifth Imam of Shia, on day of Ashura by the authority of Alqamah ibn Mohammad ibn Hazrami through a chain of transmission.

Orlando was prepared to renounce territorial claims for Dalmatia to annex Rijeka (or Fiume as the Italians called the town) - the principal seaport on the Adriatic Sea - while Sonnino was not prepared to give up Dalmatia.

The case led to attention from the highest levels of the American and Guatemalan governments, including then-US president Bill Clinton, and led to concerns about whether the safety of students was adequately protected while traveling abroad. The students were studying at St. Mary's College of Maryland. Background The college at the time conducted annual tours for students to Guatemala. The 17-day tours were conducted during the winter recess and were offered for college credit. The school was conducting its third such tour and noted that there had been no problems on either of the previous tours. However, violence against women had been rising in the area. In July 1997, a public bus was hijacked with everyone being robbed and five women, including two American citizens, being raped. Four other American women were raped in Guatemala in other incidents in July and August 1997. Details A group of 13 students‚Äî12 women and 1 man‚Äîalong with 2 faculty members and 1 administrator from St. Mary's College were returning to Guatemala City after an excursion on an educational tour of Guatemala. At about 3:30pm on January 16, 1998, their bus was forced off the road by at least four gunmen. Gunshots were fired to force the driver to pull into a ditch alongside the road. The bus was forced into a nearby sugar cane field where it wasn't visible from the road. All of the group were robbed, but the gunmen were disappointed that they weren't carrying more cash. Five women were then selected to be raped. One was raped on the bus in front of classmates and the other four were raped in the field. The passengers on the bus were required to lie face down as each of the five women, one at a time, were raped multiple times. The women who were raped were aged 19 and 20. The rape victims returned to the United States on January 17, 1998 with the rest of the group following the next day. Criminal trial Two of the rape victims returned to Guatemala in January 1999 to testify against their attackers. The men accused were Cosby Urias, a 37-year-old laborer; Rony Polanco, a 25-year-old driver; and Reyes Guch Ventura, a 25-year-old peddler. All three men were convicted and sentenced to 28 years in prison: 18 years for rape and 10 years for robbery. Civil lawsuit Three of the students sued the college, alleging that the college failed to take reasonable steps to protect them. Included as additional defendants were the board of trustees, the college president Jane Margaret O'Brien, and the two professors and administrator who accompanied the group. One victim sued for $5 million; another for $500,000; and third for $250,000. The lawsuit was eventually settled with one student receiving $100,000 (the maximum amount allowed by law); another $65,000; and the third $30,000. O'Brien claimed that the college was not responsible but was willing to settle the lawsuit to avoid the pain to all of going to trial.

The film had its premiere at the Netherlands Film Festival on 25 September 2008 and was released on DVD the following year. The film stars Ramsey Nasr as a film director who decides to test his girlfriend's love for him. The movie's soundtrack was composed by Michel Banabila and Eric Vloeimans, and features songs from their album VoizNoiz 3 - Urban Jazz Scapes. Synopsis Director Martin (Ramsey Nasr) is in a relationship with his girlfriend Simone (Sallie Harmsen), who is also his co-star in a film he's making, Real Life. Inside this film Simone is playing a character whose boyfriend Milan (played by Martin) has decided to test her love for him. For the test Simone must try to fall in love with another man. If, after this point, she decides that she's truly in love with Milan, he will consider her love genuine. Outside of the film Martin casts Fjodor (Oren Schrijver) as the love interest for the fictional Simone, only for the two to continually butt heads over Martin's directorial style (which greatly resembles method acting), forcing Martin to drop the actor. He then casts the recently separated Dirk (Loek Peters) in Fjodor's role and this seems to be a good fit. Things grow complicated when Dirk begins to fall for the real Simone, who initially only responds to him in order to elicit genuine emotions for the film. However as filming progresses Simone begins to actually respond to and grow closer to her co-star. These confusing emotions are not helped by Martin, whose directorial style blurs the lines between reality and fiction.

They also expressed disappointment in the film given Westdijk's prior filmmaking efforts and the fact that it was the opening film for the Netherlands Film Festival. A review from NU.nl expressed the same concerns, as they thought that the film was nice but also believed that Westdijk could have accomplished more.

The people from different region flocking to this semi-town local market for Sweet Shops, Cloths, Shoes, Vegetables, and various other items. Besides the original inhabitants of Kosi-Mahananda-Ganga Region, the town witnessed an influx of permanent settlers from different regions of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. Its proximity to Jharkhand brought many Adivasis close to the town. The people here speak Hindi, Urdu, Angika, Maithili, Bhojpuri, Bengali, Marwari, Surjapuri, etc. The Area has a mix of Hindu, Muslim, Christian, and Sikh religion followers. There are many temples in which Temples of Lord Shiva, Goddess Kali and Durga near Kosi River, Lord Hanuman Temple in the market are famous. Economy The major source of living is agriculture. The rice industry is a flourishing business in this area. The industry here is mainly agro based. There are also a couple of old cycle trading companies with huge turnover. Pharmaceuticals business is also pretty good with huge turnover. The main crops are Paddy, Wheat, Corn, Banana, Vegetables, Pulses, and various spices. The agriculture is the mainstay of this area, but no proper irrigation facility and poor or no electric supply has hampered the rural area dependent upon agriculture. There is large scale migration of poor people to the various cities of India in search of jobs. Transport Kolasi is on NH 81 and is the junction point for paths leading to Korha, Katihar Town, Purnea, Simariya, Baijnathpur, Sandalpur, Shivadih, Semapur etc. Nearby District town Katihar is a major railway station under North-East Frontier Railway. It is a very old station. In fact, Katihar junction is a five (Eight if local lines taken together) line junction. 1st line goes to Barauni, 2nd line to Kolkata, 3rd line to Jogbani (Nepal border), 4th line to Guwahati, 5th line to Manihari. The other three local lines go to Purana Jute Mill, Naya Jute Mill and FCI. Katihar is also the headquarters of Katihar Railway Division. The major station under this division includes New Jalpaiguri, Siliguri, Darjeeling, Kishanganj etc. The world heritage Darjeeling Himalayan Railway falls under the jurisdiction of Katihar Railway Division. One can find trains to Nepal and Bangladesh border from here. In fact pre independence this station was connected with present-day Bangladesh. All the trains passing through Katihar stops here. One can get a direct train to most of the Indian cities from this station. The notable trains are Rajdhani Express, Capital Express, Avadh Assam Express, North-East Express, Dadar Express, Amprapali Express, Sikkim Mahananda Express, Amarnath Express, Hate Bazare Express, Bangalore Express etc. Due to lack of poor road network, train communication is the only source of communication. The village falls on the national highway; NH-81 passes through the area. Road connectivity is good. Bus service is also good to Purnea, Semapur, Manihari, Bhagalpur, Patna, Ranchi, etc. The nearest commercial airport is Bagdogra (160 km). There is an old time airstrip in nearby Katihar town which is mostly used as a helipad. The place is known as Hawai Adda.

The species was discovered in October 2003 and was described by Dr Shelley Barker, OAM (Medal of the Order of Australia), in 2005. The three specimens in the type series measure from 7 mm to 8.2 mm. The species belongs in the Castiarina balteata species group which currently comprises three similarly-sized described species: Castiarina balteata (Saunders, 1869), Castiarina williamsi (Barker, 1988), and Castiarina allensundholmi Barker, 2005.  Etymology  Named for Allen Michael Sundholm OAM, entomological enthusiast and co-discover of this species. Allen was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia (OAM) in 2016 for his major significant role in the early 1980s for saving from clearing 3 million hectares of mallee, mallee-heath and woodlands in what is now known as the incredibly ecologically rich and diverse Great Western Woodlands in the state of Western Australia, Australia.  Distribution = Spatial  Geographic = As at October 2015, geographically this species is known from only two localities: (1) Prior to October 2015 only three specimens were known, being the three specimens in the type series found by Alex Scott, Allen Sundholm and Joe Bugeja in October 2003. These were found west of Euabalong West, Lachlan Plains, central New South Wales, Australia. (2) Twelve years later, in October 2015, Allen Michael Sundholm found two specimens in the Goobang Range, New South Wales. This locality extended the known range of the species 200 km to the east. The species probably has a larger geographic distribution, but this cannot be confirmed without considerable additional field work. Nevertheless, despite considerable research undertaken by entomological enthusiasts in the areas to the west of the Euabalong West sites since 1980, no further specimens have been found, indicating that the Euabalong West sites (which are ecotonal between mallee habitats to the west and open woodlands to the east) may be at or near the western geographic limit for this species. = Altitudinal = The altitude where the three specimens in the type series were found averages 170 m above the 2015 sea level. The altitude of the Goobang Range locality is 565 m above the 2015 sea level.  Temporal  All five known adult specimens were found during October, from early October to late October. The occurrence of emerged and active adult specimens at any particular site may vary several weeks earlier or later than typical for that site from one season to the next, due to natural variability in the seasons.  Habitat dependencies The Euabalong West site is within the IBRA7 Cobar Penneplain (IBRA7 code COP) bioregion and at the extreme south-western corner of the Nymagee (IBRA7 code COP04) sub-bioregion. The Goobang Range locality is within the IBRA7 New South Wales Inland Slopes (IBRA7 code NSS) bioregion, and within the Inland Slopes (IBRA7 code NSS01) sub-bioregion. Note: For the most part IBRA region and IBRA subregion boundaries are indicative only. In many areas the abutting habitat types and micro-habitat types are either ecotonal or interdigitate to a degree that is too impractical to map. In other areas the severe or even total loss of habitat due to land clearing makes defining pre-human-habitation boundaries difficult, requiring a higher reliance on soil types. The plant community at the Euabalong West locality is an ecotonal remnant between an endangered complex of mallee habitats to the west and endangered remnant box woodlands to the east. Some of the mallee habitats to the west are protected with nature reserves. The plant community at the Goobang Range locality is an open woodland dominated by Callitris endlicheri (Black Cypress Pine). Some of the surviving habitats of the Goobang Range are protected within Goobang National Park.  Biology=Early stages (ova, larva, pupa) As with most species of Australian Buprestidae, nothing is known of the early stages of this species, including the other two species in the Castiarina balteata species group. Not only are the early stages of Castiarina allensundholmi unknown, but the larval host plant(s) are also unknown, nor how long it takes to complete its life cycle from one generation to the next. The adult host plant at the Euabalong West locality, Micromyrtus sessilis, does not occur at the Goobang Range site, but may occur nearby. The adult hostplant at the Goobang Range site, an undetermined species in Leptospermum, does not occur at or near the Euabalong west site. Identification of the larval host plant(s) of Castiarina allensundholmi would assist delineating its geographic range and habitat requirements. Identification of the larval host plant(s) of the two other known species in the Castiarina balteata species group may also be of help. However, there are currently no public resources allocated to identifying the larval host plants of any Australian Buprestid species. Adult (imago) The five known (as at October 2015) adult specimens of this species were collected from the flowers of Micromyrtus sessilis (near Euabalong West, NSW) and an unidentified species in Leptospermum (Goobang Range, NSW). As is typical for species in Castiarina, the adults of this species are doubtless nectarivorous, feeding on the nectar of the adult host plants when in peak bloom. They may also feed on the petals. Environmental factors such as climatic conditions, e.g. drought, or a certain amount of prior rainfall at a certain time of the season, may respectively either inhibit adult emergence or trigger pupation followed by adult emergence. Threats=Habitat loss If the two known (as at October 2015) localities for this species are any guide, then there has been severe loss of this species habitat since human settlement. Continued land clearance in its known range generally, particularly the two known sites, neither of which lies within a nature conservation reserve, would likely be significantly detrimental to its survival. Climate change No studies have been published to assess the impact of climate change on this species nor on any other described or undescribed species in the Australian Buprestid fauna, which comprises at least 1,600 species. However, given the very limited habitat within its known geographic range generally, rapid climate change (e.g. within 10 ‚Äì 100 years) to a climate beyond the climate variations this species can consistently withstand would likely be significantly detrimental to its survival.

Recent Developments  After over two years of fighting, the Sinjar Defense Units (HPS) left the Sinjar Alliance in 2017 to join the Peshmerga and serve under the Kurdish Government (KRG), who publicly denounced them months just before.  Sinjar Resistance Units (YB≈û)  The YB≈û is a militia that is made up of only Yazidi people, both men and women, with roots dating back to 2007. The YPG, a PKK affiliated militia known for its women fighters, played a large roll in the training of YB≈û forces, this links the YB≈û and the PKK heavily. In the summer of 2015 YB≈û troop numbers totaled around 2,000 Yazidi men and women. This number continues to swell due to training by YPG and other support. The YB≈û assisted the YPG in all actions in Sinjar. In YB≈û early existence it assisted in maintaining supply roads for HPS and YPG as a corridor was created for Yazidi safe passage out of Sinjar.  Sheikh Khairy Khedr  Sheikh Khairy Kedr was the first commander of the Sinjar Resistance Units (YB≈û ). He died fighting against ISIS during Sinjar massacre in 2014. He was an inspiration to the resistance, he came from the Yazidi villages that were bombed in 2007 and spent much of his life resisting the IS. One soldier who fought alongside Sheikh Khairy Khedr stated, \\"all the men cried for Sheikh Khairy. They said, ‚ÄòIf we lose Sheikh Khairy, we will become 1,000 Sheikh Khairy‚Äôs. We will resist.‚Äô Still, they cried‚Äô\\".  Zaki Shingali  Zaki Shingali led the YB≈û after Sheikh Khairy Kedr. Shingali died in 2018, just minutes after attending a vigil for those Yazidi‚Äôs that lost their lives in the ISIS assault on Sinjar. His vehicle was hit by a Turkish missile. Ankara commented on his death, saying that it was a success and that one of the most wanted PKK militants had been killed. He was specifically targeted for his PKK and Kurdish roots by the Turkish government and had been identified as a senior PKK figure. Shingali led the YB≈û using PKK ideology, and because of this, the PKK legacy lives on in the YB≈û to this day.  √äz√Ædxan Women's Units (YJ√ä)  The YJ√ä is a resistance unit composed of Yazidi women, many of whom are survivors of ISIS enslavement. Yazidi women and girls faced months, sometimes years of abuse from their ISIS captures. As a result, many of these women are at the forefront of the battle between ISIS and the Yazidis, ‚ÄúThere is no one like them!‚Äù Joined by their female comrades, the YPG, the YJ√ä plays a crucial role in defending the Yazidi people from IS attacks.  Training  The YPG provides three months of ideological training to new recruits. Much of this ideology comes from the PKK and Abdullah Ocalan. This mainly consists of making them to ‚Äúknow who they are, what they are doing, what it is to be equal. It‚Äôs easy to teach them to shoot, but psychologically...‚Äù. YPG trains many survivors of ISIS captivity, stating: ‚ÄúIsis took those women and children because they wanted to destroy their honour. We help train the Yazidi women to defend themselves and then they can control their own future‚Äù.  Group Politics  Their strategic position is a defensive one, only about 20% of percent of Sinjar is in the hands of Yazidis and Kurds, the rest is ISIS occupied, to avoid heavy casualties they hold their ground. The founding goals of YJ√ä were to defend Yazidi women's rights and Yazidi tradition as well as to protect Mount Sinjar. As time has passed, YJ√ä ideology has taken on a much more global scope by using PKK rhetoric known as Jineology. Currently, YJ√ä ideology maintains an aggressive stance; In 2017, YJ√ä issued a statement: ‚ÄúWe repeat over and over again that we are continuing our struggle and resistance anywhere for kidnapped Yazidi women and all oppressed women, we will hold the struggle flag high and continue our battle against all kinds of oppression and persecution wherever it existed‚Äù .  Sinjar Defense Units (HPS)  The HPS is one of the original three Yazidian resistance groups. It consisted of over 5,000 fighters, of which approximately 400 are women. HPS is led by Yazidian military commander, Haydar Shesho. In the initial attacks on Mount Sinjar, the HPS can be credited with protecting the Yazidis on Mount Sinjar as well as providing them with supplies to the best of their ability. The HPS did not share the same PKK ideology as the YB≈û and the YJ√ä and have since left the Sinjar Alliance.  Attacks on Sinjar  ISIS attacks on Sinjar City began on August 3rd, 2014https://go.gale.com/ps/retrieve.do?tabID=T002&resultListType;=RESULT_LIST&searchResultsType;=SingleTab&searchType;=BasicSearchForm&currentPosition;=1&docId;=GALE%7CA493733315&docType;=Article&sort;=Relevance&contentSegment;=ZGPP- MOD1&prodId;=ITOF&contentSet;=GALE%7CA493733315&searchId;=R2&userGroupName;=nysl_ca_unionc&inPS;=true.

Airstrikes directed towards ISIS strongholds played a key role in holding off ISIS advances towards Mount Sinjar. The majority of Yazidis found safe passage through a corridor into Iraqi Kurdistan, provided by the YPG, PKK, HPS and the newly formed YB≈û.  Yazidi and ISIS Relations  The Yazidis are a group of indigenous people from Iraq, Syria and Turkey. They practice an ancient religion that worships a monotheistic God. The Yazidi people have been subjected to persecution for their entire existence. In the age of the Ottoman Empire, the Yazidis suffered 72 Genocidal Massacres. Prior to ISIS, Al-Qaeda identified the Yazidis as ‚ÄúInfidels‚Äù. To this day the trend continues, Cale Salih wrote, ‚ÄúThe rise of Islamic fundamentalism more broadly has pushed thousands of Yazidis to seek asylum in Europe\\". According to estimates, 70,000 people, or about 15% of the Yazidi population in Iraq, has fled the country since recent persecution. Germany has absorbed most of the refugees.  PKK Involvement  While U.S. airstrikes and Peshmerga assistance receive most of the praise for the rescue of the Yazidis on Mount Sinjar in 2014, most Yazidi people agree that without the PKK they would not have found safe passage to Syrian Kurdistan. The PKK and YPG follow the ideology of Abdullah Ocalan, namely concerning the empowerment of women and upholding basic human rights. It is for this reason that the resistance groups came to the aid of the Yazidis, along with the Yazidis being considered ethnically Kurdish, exposing them to the ongoing war between the Kurds and the Islamic State.  Kurdish and PKK Relations  PKK philosophy like Democratic Confederalism and other ideology put forth by both the YB≈û and the YJ√ä are at odds with the Kurdistan Regional Government, which pursues full control over the Sinjar region and publicly demands the withdrawal of PKK-linked groups. The looming presence of the Kurdish government is precisely why some Yazidi KDP politicians denounced the alliance at first, PKK involvement appeared to threaten Yazidi autonomy. The PKK however is completely separate from KRG policy, and practices ‚ÄúGrassroots Democracy‚Äù, one PKK militant stated, \\"when the comrades liberate a village, they let the community to decide for itself\\". The KRG has publicly stated its distaste with the PKK regularly. After they left the Sinjar Alliance in 2017, leader of the Sinjar Defense Units (HPS), Haydar Shesho stated that PKK groups, like the Sinjar Alliance (YB≈û and YJ√ä), have no business in the Sinjar region.  Turkish Offensive  Since the United States removed troops from the Turkish and Syrian border on October 7, 2019, Yazidis have begun to flee their home villages in Syrian Kurdistan, fearing that history will repeat itself. One villager was quoted saying, \\"We left in the middle of the night for fear that they would kill us as happened with our people in Sinjar\\". The Turkish government publicly stated that it will clear its southern border of Kurds, primarily the YPG, YB≈û and other PKK backed groups, in what they claim is a resettlement plan for Syrian refugees living in Turkey. This will put Yazidis at double the risk for persecution by the Turks and other groups, by living in a Kurdish occupied area, and not being Muslim. Yazidi officials signed a letter in September, 2019 saying: ‚Äúthe current events in northeastern Syria, if not halted, will annihilate Yazidis from their ancestral homeland in Syria‚Äù. These threats maintain constant, even though the offensive is effectively over, in the time before Turkey halted it‚Äôs offensive, approximately 170,000 citizens were displaced, many of which were Yazidi. It is estimated that over 200,000 Yazidi people remain homeless or in shelters as a result of persecution by IS.  Quotes  YJ√ä Soldier: \\"For ISIS it's a haram. If you're killed by a woman, you don't go to paradise\\". Noble Peace Prize Recipient, Nadia Murad: ‚ÄúToday Turkey carried several air strikes in different locations in Sinjar. Sinjar continues to be a war zone. How can Yazidis recover from this genocide or go back home‚Äù.

Reception =Critical response The film received positive reviews from critics. Goutham V. S. of The Indian Express rated 3.5 stars out of 5 and stated that the director has showed discipline while handling dramatic situations and \\"has used his observations to good effect as the strong relationship bonds inside Jacob's family members and their informal homely behaviour was captured with shots that impart warmth and positive vibes, like the feel of an early morning coffee\\". He gave a special mention for the performance of Ahwin Kumar and praised the editing. Padmakumar K. of Malayala Manorama wrote \\"Being a story based on true incidents it could have been told in a more poignant manner. But Vineeth chose to play it safe by arranging the lighter and the turbid moments at regular intervals to make it an arresting narrative rather than delving deep into the heart of the issue\\" and rated 3 stars out of 5. He praised the performances of Renji Panicker, Lakshmy Ramakrishnan and Ashwin Kumar. Gautaman Bhaskaran of Hindustan Times awarded 3 out of 5 and stated \\"The movie stays pretty much focussed ‚Äì and does not stray into any romantic alleyways (though Jerry has a girlfriend) ‚Äì except to include a few squabbles which one of Jerry's brothers gets into. These add a certain balance to the film's structure, and with performances by most of the cast members ‚Äì particularly Pauly, Panicker and Ramakrishnan ‚Äì disarmingly understated, Sreenivasan's work is captivating (sic)\\". He appreciated the editing. Akhila Menon of Filmibeat rated 3.5 out of 5 and praised the performances of Renji Panicker, Nivin Pauly, and Lakshmy Ramakrishnan. She wrote \\"The director has perfectly narrated the well-written script, with the right mix of light humour and emotional elements\\" praising Vineeth Sreenivasan. She also lauded the cinematography, editing and the songs, especially \\"Thiruvaavaniraavu\\". Anu James of International Business Times awarded 4 out of 5 and mentioned \\"Although the movie is predictable, the beautiful moments we come across make us feel relaxed, eager to know how the movie progresses. The first half is totally a Renji Panicker show, while the second half belongs to Nivin as the hero\\". She praised the performances of Renji Panicker and Lakshmy Ramakrishnan, cinematography, editing, and songs. Sanjith Sidhardhan of The Times of India stated \\"Vineeth has taken extra effort to tell this real-life story as honestly as possible, the added attention may have dropped the entertainment quotient a tad. The film, however, makes up with several feel-good moments that accentuate the value of relationships\\". He praised the casting and performances of Lakshmi Ramakrishnan, Renji Panicker, Ashwin Kumar, and Nivin Pauly, and also cinematography and music. He rated 4 out of 5 stars. Mani Prabhu of NDTV is written \\"the first hour of the film, which brilliantly establishes the Jacobs' kind of family, despite baiting us with continuous Vishu movie cliches, superbly spins each of them in tasteful angles\\", \\"the second half of the film, which gives all the opportunities for unabashed melodrama and parental sentiments, is surprisingly restrained, refreshing and free of bloat. The romantic track is brushed away confidently with a two-minute exposition. Characters don't go out of their way for the sake of entertainment\\". He also praised the performances of Nivin Pauly, Renji Panicker, Lakshmy Ramakrishnan, and Sreenath Bhasi. Sify described it \\"Emotional roller coaster\\" and wrote \\"...the story has been narrated in a highly conventional manner to the extent that things get a bit predictable at times. But considering this has been a real life story that a family actually went through, it can be justified generally\\".

The practice was prevalent in the Saurashtra and Kutch region of India. The phrase is a euphemism literally meaning \\"feeding of milk\\". History During a census in 1805, the British officials found almost no girls in Jhareya Rajput families of the Kutch and Kathiawar regions. The 11th edition of Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (1910) noted under the topic Infanticide that this method was practiced by some Rajputs to avoid paying dowry later. It noted that Rajahs sometimes paid over as a dowry. The British resident in Baroda, Colonel Walker, insisted on banning the practice while signing pacts with the local Rajputs. The practice however continued until the late 19th century.

It is situated in the east of the city, into which it was incorporated on 1 April 1914. There are roughly 13,300 people in Schinkel. The name Schinkel is possibly a reference to the flank-like (Schenkel) form of the Schinkelberg (Schinkel Hill); however the exact meaning and origin of the name are unknown. Contrary to some claims it is unlikely that the district was named after the Prussian builder Karl Friedrich Schinkel. Colloquially and among local residents, the district tends to be referred to as ‚Äúder‚Äù (the) Schinkel.  Geography  The Schinkel district's original boundaries originally encompassed today's districts of Schinkel, Schinkel-Ost, Widukindland, the southern part of Dodesheide, the western part of Darum/Gretesch/L√ºstringen and the north-west corner of Voxtrup; in the city of Osnabr√ºck districts were not arranged based on the boundaries of former areas or communities. Next to the district of Schinkel there is also the district of Schinkel-Ost, which is home to about 3,500 people. The district of Gartlage is also commonly regarded as being part of Schinkel, even though it never actually lay within Schinkel's boundaries.  Infrastructure  Pauluskirche (St. Paul's Church) Heilig-Kreuz-Kirche (Church of the Holy Cross) Gnadenkirche (Church of Mercy) During World War II most of the residential houses in Osnabr√ºck were destroyed in air raids. The first attack on the Schinkel area, on 23 June 1940, was directed at the Osnabr√ºcker Kupfer- und Drahtwerk (Osnabr√ºck Copper and Wire Works, abbreviated OKD, today KM Europa Metal) ‚Äì by the time the war finished in May 1945, 65% of it had been destroyed. Today's Schinkel is characterized by its integration of numerous nationalities. The district is home to numerous primary schools and kindergartens; however the local library had to close in 2010 due to the city's troubled economic situation. The district is also popular among older citizens. Around the Sch√ºtzenstra√üe area lies the beating heart of Schinkel: numerous shops, pharmacies, doctors and bank branches. Every Wednesday there is a Wochenmarkt (weekly market) on Ebertallee, located between the Heilig- Kreuz-Kirche and the Pauluskirche. On Buerschen Stra√üe there are several new facilities for senior citizens as well as the ‚ÄúJunger Schinkel‚Äù (Young Schinkel) project. A residential area with terraced houses has encouraged many families to live in Schinkel. Sports clubs (such as VfL Osnabr√ºck, SC T√ºrkg√ºc√º, VfB Schinkel, Blau-Wei√ü Schinkel, Sportfreunde Schinkel-Ost), a citizens‚Äô association, numerous choirs and a convivial atmosphere also define this district's character. Its spacious indoor swimming pool ‚Äì the Schinkelbad ‚Äì attracts many visitors. Schinkel is also the location of the osnatel-Arena, located by the Bremer bridge ‚Äì the stadium of VfL Osnabr√ºck. Schinkel is the home of the 1. Osnabr√ºcker Nachbarschaftsverein (First Neighbourhood Association). There are also two Evangelical/Protestant churches ‚Äì the Pauluskirche and the Jakobuskirche (Jacobus Church) ‚Äì two Catholic churches ‚Äì the Heilig-Kreuz-Kirche and the St. Maria Rosenkranzkirche (St. Mary's Rosary Church) ‚Äì and two mosques (Fatih Camii and Takwa). The Reformed Protestant Gnadenkirche (Church of Mercy), built in 1960, was completely pulled down apart from its bell tower due to financial difficulties, to make way for a day care centre for children.Neue Osnabr√ºcker Zeitung, 7 May 2011, p.27 The Schinkelberg and Gartlage are two green belts, which offer their residents particularly good opportunities for recreation. Two bunkers are situated on Oststra√üe ‚Äì the Ostbunker and a round bunker on the site of the railway repair works. It is colloquially referred to as ‚ÄúOtto Bunker‚Äù; this name is even visible on the bunker itself.Luftschutz, Bunker und Stollen in Osnabr√ºck (Air Raid Protection, Bunkers and Tunnels in Osnabr√ºck) (in German) The railway depot in Schinkel, which was established in 1876, was in earlier times colloquially referred to as ‚ÄúKamerun‚Äù (Cameroon).‚ÄúUnser Schinkel‚Äù (Our Schinkel) newspaper (in German) The depot was demolished in April 2009; since then a discount food and clothing store has been built on the site. Schinkel is a district rich in tradition, with developed residential and business infrastructure. Its roots stretch back to the 19th century. Leasers and traders live and work here ‚Äì some have done for generations. This cultural image is more pronounced here than in any other district of Osnabr√ºck.  Personalities  The pastor Richard Karwehl was active in the evangelical Pauluskirche during the period of Nazi rule ‚Äì having taken up opposition to National Socialism due to his Christian convictions, he was also an active figure in the Confessing Church. The square in front of the church is named after him (Richard-Karwehl-Platz). The journalist and author Harald Wehmeier (born 1953) was born in Schinkel.  Transportation  Osnabr√ºck's tram line 3 operated in Schinkel until 1958, running from the terminus station ‚ÄúSchinkel‚Äù on the corner between Sch√ºtzenstra√üe and Bremer Stra√üe and passing through Sch√ºtzenstra√üe and Buersche Stra√üe towards Neumarkt-Martiniplatz (today Heinrich-L√ºbke-Platz, named after Germany's second Federal President) in the Weststadt district. Today the district is served by bus lines 11/12/13, 71/72, 91/92 ‚Äì each running every ten minutes ‚Äì connecting it to the nearby Innenstadt (city centre) and surrounding districts. The construction of a regional train station in the Bremer Br√ºcke/Halle Gartlage area is being considered ‚Äì earlier a platform for special trips was situated here. The police have given support to this idea in the citizens‚Äô forum, with regards to football matches and visitors to the stadium.

Plot In the Russian Empire at the end of the 19th century, Hanne Liebe is a little Jewish girl who lives in a small town on the Dnieper where she is submitted to racial prejudice notably at the Christian-Russian school that she attends. Hanne- Liebe grows up and in her last year at school, she falls in love with a Russian boy, Sasha. Fedya, the son of her neighbour, the rich and anti-semitic merchant Suchowerski, with whom she played when she was a child, spreads a rumour that they are having an affair. As a result, she is expelled from school. Her mother asks a matchmaker to find a suitable husband for her, in order to get her married as soon as possible. Revolted by the man presented to her, Hanne-Liebe flees to Saint Petersburg, to live with her brother Yakov. Yakov, who was cursed by his father when he became an Christian Orthodox, is now a successful lawyer. He is very happy to see his sister again but his wife refuses that she lives with them. Jakov arranges for her to live with some childless friends, the Florovs, where she is very happy. Sasha is also living in St. Petersburg and he has joined one of the revolutionary circles which are flourishing in a context of social unrest. At a literary and political evening organised by the Florovs, Hanne Liebe meets Sasha again, who introduces her to his friend Rylowitsch, another revolutionary. Yakov recognises him as a secret police agent and asks Sasha to come to his office the following day to warn him but Sasha is arrested the same evening. Hanne Liebe, worried that Sasha had not come to his appointment goes looking for him and is arrested in her turn. Thanks to Yakov she is released, but only under the condition that she goes back to her hometown. As the social unrest is increasing, the head of the secret police decides to foment some pogroms to re-direct the people discontent towards the Jews. Rylowitsch dressed as a monk travels through the country, stirring up anti-Jewish feelings with false rumours. In 1905, a general strike is decided and the revolution spreads through the country. The Tsar must make some concessions and adopts the October manifesto granting new civil rights and the release of political prisoners. Yakov, having learned that his mother is dying travels back to his home town, where Suchowerski and Rylowitsch are busy fomenting hostility against the Jewish population. After a procession in honor of the Tsar the people led by Suchowerski and Rylowitsch storm the Jewish ghetto, killing people, plundering their property, and setting the synagogue ablaze. Yakov is shot dead by Rylowitsch and Hanne-Liebe is chased by Fedya. Meanwhile, Sasha, who had been released from jail, convinces the revolutionary leaders to let him use a locomotive to go back to his hometown where he feels that Hanne Liebe is in danger. He arrives just in time to rescue her from Fedya whom he shoots dead. Hanne-Liebe and Sasha join the crowd of Jews fleeing Russia.Review, synopsis and link to watch the film:  Cast  * Polina Piekowskaja as Hanne-Liebe * Wladimir Gaidarow as Jakow Segal * Thorleif Reiss as Alexander Krasnow (Sasha) * Adele Reuter-Eichberg as Hanne-Liebe's mother * Johannes Meyer as Rylowitsch * Richard Boleslawski as Gawrik Suchowerski (Fedja) * J.N.

It was shot near Berlin, in , where a city consisting of 25 different buildings was built, with a synagogue and an orthodox church and separate Russian and Jewish quarters. In order to guarantee the authenticity of the film, Dreyer together with the set designer Jens Lind had travelled to Lublin in Poland, where he had visited the Jewish quarter. In addition, several of the actors were coming from Moscow theaters and for the crowd scenes, actual Jewish refugees from Russia were employed, some of them having personally experienced some fifteen years before events similar to the pogrom described in the film.  Preservation and Restoration  The original German version is considered lost but a version with Russian intertitles has been found at the Cin√©math√®que de Toulouse and, on that basis, a digitally restored version was created by the Danish Film Institute in 2006. New intertitles were created on the basis of the original script by Dreyer completed by a Swedish censorship list.

MS Rotterdam shares her name with six previous Holland America ships and will become the company's new flagship upon her debut. Originally named Ryndam, she will be the third of HAL's Pinnacle class in the fleet and is scheduled to be delivered in July 2021.  History = Planning and construction  On 19 January 2017, Carnival Corporation announced that it had signed a memorandum with Fincantieri for the third Pinnacle-class vessel for HAL. The vessel was planned to be designed in line with the features and dimensions offered on her sister ships, MS Koningsdam and MS Nieuw Statendam, at 99,500 GT and with a guest capacity of approximately 2,660 passengers. Construction for the then- unnamed ship inaugurated with the steel-cutting on 13 March 2019 at Fincantieri's shipyard in Marghera. On 7 April 2019, HAL announced the name of the third Pinnacle-class ship as MS Ryndam in honor of the name's history with the cruise line. On 3 October 2019, HAL marked a milestone in the construction of Ryndam, when the first hull block was floated out to sea from Fincantieri's shipyard in Palermo. She had her keel laid on 21 November 2019 in Marghera. The rest of the ship's hull blocks are being constructed in Marghera, and the ship's steel superstructure was expected to be completed in July 2020, with an official float-out happening shortly thereafter. On 30 July 2020, HAL announced that Ryndam would be renamed MS Rotterdam in honor of the name's storied heritage within the company's history and after MS Rotterdam had been sold earlier in the year. HAL also announced that her delivery would be postponed from May 2021 to 30 July 2021, citing the COVID-19 pandemic.  Operational career  Rotterdam was originally scheduled to set sail for her maiden voyage, from Trieste to Civitavecchia, on 21 May 2021, calling in Dubrovnik, Kotor, Corfu, Taormina, and Naples. However, due to the postponement of the ship's delivery, the maiden voyage is postponed to 1 August 2021. She will then re-position to Amsterdam, where she will be homeported for her inaugural season, cruising to Northern Europe, including Norway, Iceland, and the Baltic region. In October 2021, she will sail to Fort Lauderdale for her North American debut.

Geography Located just to the east of the town of Childers, Doolbi is bordered to the south by the Bruce Highway. The land in Doolbi is almost entirely used for farming with a small area of residential housing and the Isis Golf Course in the centre of the locality; there is no commercial development. History In 1890 the first sugar cane crushing mill in the Isis district was established at Doolbi. The mill produced juice, which was then taken to Yengarie for processing into sugar. In 1900, the Doolbi mill was upgraded to produce sugar. As more sugar mills opened in the district, there was not enough cane to keep them all profitable and the Doolbi mill closed in 1924. The mill was in the south-western corner of the present Isis Golf Course () and an old brick chimney is still visible. Horton State School opened circa 1888.

At the time of its release the song was a hit, and got constant airplay in Brazilian radio and television. Marcelo is the composer, singer and solo player of the biggest hit of Los Hermanos, the song Anna Julia, which was later covered by Jim Capaldi in an English-language version, featuring Capaldi, Deep Purple's Ian Paice on drums, The Jam's Paul Weller in bass and the beatle George Harrison on solo guitar.BBC news (August/2001) The song was also recorded in Spanish by Los Hermanos, and in Italian by Daniele Groff. After this initial success, Anna Julia gradually featured less in Los Hermanos' setlists. The band felt that the song, a radio ballad, did not represent the band's style, and was, according to Camelo himself, \\"a sticky song that the label made us play to exhaustion\\".

She was a keen Protestant and opponent of \\"that most detestable idollatrie of the papists\\".The Feminist Companion to Literature in English, eds Virginia Blain, Patricia Clements and Isobel Grundy (London: Batsford, 1990), p. 255.Julia Gasper, \\"Cunningham, Lady Margaret (d. 1622?)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (Oxford, UK: OUP, 2004 Retrieved 15 November 2015. Pay-walled This erroneously refers to James Cunningham as the 6th Earl. Her sister was Lady Ann Cunningham. Account of cruelty Lady Margaret suffered great cruelty at the hands of her first husband, Sir James Hamilton of Crawfordjohn, whom she married on 24 January 1598. Initially, she continued to live with her parents and early attempts to join him at his Evandale estate were rebuffed. Her memoir describes him as \\"unkind, cruell and malicious\\": he failed to give her money for food, believed \\"misreports\\" against her, and turned her out of the house naked in the middle of the night, so that she and her maidservant were forced to take shelter in the minister's house. She states that she was sick and pregnant at the time. As a modern commentator has pointed out, her detailed account is of importance also as \\"evidence of the acute vulnerability of wives and the inability of law, custom, and even powerful kinsmen to guarantee protection from brutal husbands.\\" Later, while reconciled with Hamilton, Lady Margaret expressed her strong Protestantism and rejoiced in the possibility of her husband's salvation from \\"that most detestable idollatrie of the papists.\\" The close of this letter declares an intention to add a \\"poor basket of stones to the strengthening of the walls of Jerusalem\\". This follows almost verbatim a passage in Anne Locke's 1590 dedication to the Countess of Warwick.Warwick University document citing National Library of Scotland Retrieved 15 November 2015 However, after bearing Hamilton five children, Lady Margaret refused to sleep with him any more because of his adultery and his \\"excommunication for slaughter\\". She had left him by the time she wrote up her memoirs in 1608, which were published in Edinburgh in 1827. The estrangement left her living in penury with her children in Libertoun.Possibly, at \\"Libberton\\" near Crawfordjohn. Happier marriage After Hamilton's death in or after 1608, Lady Margaret was remarried as the third wife of Sir James Maxwell of Calderwood. Her letters show this to have been a happy marriage. The couple had two sons and four daughters. Her daughter Jean by her first marriage married James, a son of Maxwell by an earlier marriage of his. After she had been widowed again, Lady Margaret wrote in 1622 from Malsly to her sister, Lady Ann Cunningham, the Marchioness of Hamilton, appealing to her to help the children who survived her and enclosing a will dated 2 October 1622.

Groundbreaking was commenced by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on November 11, 2015, and construction is scheduled for completion by December 2017. The project will utilize regasified liquefied natural gas (RLNG) for fuel, with diesel as an alternate backup. A 40 kilometer long transmission line with a capacity of 500 kilovolts will also be constructed between the new plant and a grid station in southern Lahore. Bidding was open to international firms for the 82 billion rupee project. China's Harbin Electric Company was announced as the lowest evaluated bidder for the project on October 2, 2015, having offered a levellised electricity cost of 7.973 cents per unit, outbidding the Turkish conglomerate Enka ƒ∞n≈üaat ve Sanayi A.≈û. and GE Consortium which both stood in second with 8.185 cents per unit tariff, followed by China Machinery Eng Co (CMEC) & SEFC at 8.304 cents, and Hyundai Engineering at 8.332 cents per unit. Project Financing Plans for the project call for private sector investment to construct the plant, with the private company then selling electricity to the government of Pakistan at pre-negotiated rates. It is not financed under CPEC projects. As the project is to be constructed largely by the private sector, financing loans for the project do not fall under the concessionary loan agreement which finances CPEC projects, but it will still qualify for subsidized loans with an interest rate of 5% which are to be dispersed by the Exim Bank of China. For comparison, loans for previous Pakistani infrastructure projects financed by the World Bank carried an interest rate between 5% and 8.5%, while interest rates on market loans approach 12%.  Project Troubles  Along with its sister Bhikki plant, the site faces issues with power generation. The Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) was given notice of zero power generation by the plants and issued investigations. As of November 2019, the current PM of Pakistan Imran Khan wishes to privatize the Balloki power plant along with a few others.
