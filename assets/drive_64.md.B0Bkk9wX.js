Early life and education  Whitfield was born on November 8, 1860 on his father's plantation in Wayne County, North Carolina. He was a member of the Whitfield family, a prominent planter family in the American South. In 1863, Whitfield and his father moved to their plantation in Leon County, Florida. Whitfield later moved to the nearby city of Tallahassee, Florida, where he studied law at the West Florida Seminary, later attending the University of Virginia receiving his Bachelor of Laws degree in 1886. He was admitted into the Florida Bar later that year.  Political career  In 1888, Whitfield, a bank teller at the time, became the personal secretary of Florida Governor Edward A. Perry. The following year, he was appointed Clerk of the Florida Supreme Court. Whitfield, a Democrat, served in this position until June 19, 1897, when he was appointed Florida State Treasurer, succeeding Clarence B. Collins, who had resigned following his impeachment in the Florida House of Representatives for mismanaging state funds. Whitfield served as State Treasurer until March 1903, when he was appointed Florida Attorney General following the election of the incumbent, William Bailey Lamar, to the U.S. House of Representatives. = Florida Supreme Court = In February 1904, Whitfield was appointed to the Florida Supreme Court by Governor William Sherman Jennings. Whitfield served on the court until his retirement on January 4, 1943, making him the second-longest serving Florida Supreme Court justice, only behind William Glenn Terrell. Additionally, Whitfield was elected Chief Justice by the court three times, serving in that role from January 1905 until June 1905, 1909 until 1913, and 1935 until 1937. Whitfield's tenure on the court was marked by a period of great uncertainty regarding the rights of African Americans in Florida. Whitfield himself did not have an opinion on the topic as a whole, rather regarding it on a case-by- case basis, often leading to conflicting opinions. For example, Whitfield wrote the majority opinion for Montgomery v. State (1908), in which he wrote that it is unlawful to exclude black jurors from trials. On the other hand, however, he reaffirmed racial segregation in Florida East Coast Ry. Co. v. Geiger (1913), which upheld separate but equal, and Parramore v. State (1921), which upheld a ban on mixed-race marriages. Whitfield retired from the court on January 4, 1943, due to declining health.  Personal life  Whitfield married Leila Nash on November 25, 1886. Nash died from complications following the birth of their first child, John Nash, in 1897. Whitfield later married Margaret Howard Rudolph on June 12, 1901. They had five children together, Mary Croom, James Bryan Jr., Julia, Margaret, and Randolph.  Death and Legacy  Whitfield died on August 20, 1948 at his home in Tallahassee, Florida. He is buried in Tallahassee's Saint Johns Episcopal Church Cemetery. In 1945, Whitfield received an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from the University of Florida. The University of Florida also has a scholarship in his memory, the Judge James Bryan Whitfield Constitutional Law Scholarship.

It uses a body-on-frame construction, with rear-wheel-drive and selectable four-wheel-drive, and is available with either gasoline or diesel engines. In Australia, it was being marketed as the X-Series, with model names relating to engine size, thus as the X240 and the X200. The vehicle has passed the European tests regarding environment protection, safety and performance and is entitled for marketing throughout the European Union. It is the successor of the Great Wall Haval H3 and both cars are nearly identical, except for their front designs. Features It uses Mitsubishi 4G63 and Mitsubishi 4G69S4N petrol engines of 2.0 and 2.4 litres, or the GW2.5TCI diesel. In October 2010, the more powerful but smaller (2.0 litres) GW4D20 diesel was added to the lineup. The Haval H5 comes with either a five-speed or a six-speed manual transmission, depending on model. It uses disk brakes. It has three trims: Standard, Luxury and Premium. The Premium trim features power windows, power door locks, rear window defrosters, leather seats, power adjustable driver's seat, six speakers, a DVD player, GPS and a power sunroof all as standard. Heated seats are optional. Styling of the body and rear end of the Haval H5 is extremely similar to the exterior design of the Isuzu Axiom.

Warren developed the technique of producing stereoscopic images of the breast with X-rays while working in the Department of Radiology at the University of Rochester School of Medicine. Warren was commissioned as a colonel in the United States Army Medical Corps in 1943 and appointed Chief of the Medical Section of the Manhattan Engineering District. He was responsible for the health and safety of the thousands of personnel involved in the Manhattan Project. He was present at the Trinity nuclear test in Alamogordo, New Mexico where he was responsible for the safety aspects of the detonation of the world's first nuclear weapon. He led a survey team from the Manhattan Project to assess the effects of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In 1946 he was Chief of the Radiological Safety Section of the Joint Task Force for Operation Crossroads, the nuclear test at Bikini Atoll. In 1947 Warren became the first dean of the School of Medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). Under his leadership, the new school grew from nothing to a major medical school. Although controversial and opposed by James Bryant Conant, Warren would speak out about the dangers of nuclear fallout from weapons testing from about 1947 onwards and upon the Castle Bravo test in 1954 his views were lent some credence, which informed opinion leading up to the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.Greene, Benjamin (2006). Eisenhower, Science Advice, and the Nuclear Test-Ban Debate, 1945‚Äì1963. Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press. page 10-11 Warren became Vice Chancellor, Health Services in 1962 at UCLA. From 1963 to 1965 he served as special assistant to President John F. Kennedy and later Lyndon B. Johnson on mental retardation. Returning to UCLA in 1965, he became professor emeritus, a position he held until his death in 1981. In 1971, he was awarded the Enrico Fermi Award for his contributions to science and medicine. Early life Stafford Leak Warren was born in Maxwell, New Mexico on June 19, 1896. He attended the University of California, Berkeley, where he earned his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1918. He married Viola Lockhart on May 22, 1920. Their marriage produced two sons and a daughter. He went to medical school at the University of California, San Francisco, graduating with his Doctor of Medicine degree in 1922. He then did post-doctoral work at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and Harvard University. University of Rochester Warren joined the faculty of the Department of Radiology at the University of Rochester School of Medicine in 1926, becoming an Assistant Professor of Medicine. The department was a new one that had only been founded in 1921, based upon the ideals of medical education propounded by Abraham Flexner in his 1910 Flexner Report. The medical school had opened in 1925 and did not graduate its first class until 1929. Warren was one of the original group that Dean George Whipple assembled to staff the new medical school. At Rochester, Warren investigated the effects of artificial fever, including its possible use for treating gonococci infections. He was also interested in radiography. In 1930, Warren became an Associate Professor of Medicine. That year he published \\"A Roentgenologic Study of the Breast\\". X-ray imaging of the breast had first been investigated by Albert Salomon at the University of Berlin in 1913. He produced images of over 3,000 mastectomy specimens, and observed different forms and stages of cancer. He was even able to detect an undiagnosed cancer in a breast that had been removed because of a large cyst. However, Salomon apparently did not appreciate the life saving potential of his observations. Warren used radiology to track changes in breast tissue as a result of pregnancy and mastitis. He developed a stereoscopic technique, using patients rather than specimens and adapting general purpose X-ray equipment to his needs. His method involved having the patient lie on her side with one arm raised while being X-rayed. In 119 women who subsequently underwent surgery, he correctly found breast cancer in 54 out of 58 cases. This represented a leap forward, as it made diagnosis of breast cancer possible without surgery. It also sparked intense interest in the technique around the world. Today mammography saves thousands of lives. Manhattan Project In February 1943, Warren met with Dr Albert K. Chapman, the vice president and general manager of Eastman Kodak, Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves, the director of the Manhattan Project and Colonel James C. Marshall, the commander of the Manhattan Engineer District (MED). They asked him about his work with radiation and isotopes and asked Warren to become a civilian consultant for the MED. In March 1943, Warren met with Major Hymer L. Friedell at the MED's New York City headquarters. Friedell had joined the Metallurgical Laboratory in August 1942 from the University of California, Berkeley, where he had been involved in radiology research under Dr Robert S. Stone. Friedell requested information about safety matters involving radiation. Warren was unable to provide all the information, but agreed to initiate research at Rochester. alt=A group of men in uniforms stand in front of a wooden building. One, holding a box, is very tall, towering over the Asian man next to him. Friedell recommended that in view of the scope of the Manhattan Project, a more senior officer be placed in charge. In October, Groves penned a letter to the Surgeon General of the United States Army, Major General Norman T. Kirk, requesting that he cooperate with the Manhattan Project in furnishing medical supplies, providing funds for medical care of military personnel, and directly commissioning Warren and other doctors at specified ranks. This letter was signed by Lieutenant General Brehon B. Somervell and delivered in person by Colonel Kenneth D. Nichols, who had replaced Marshall as the district engineer. Kirk was furious at what he saw as usurpation of his statutory responsibilities as Surgeon General. When told that Warren was the man the district had in mind to commission as a colonel, and apparently familiar with Warren's work only from his use of radiation to treat venereal disease asked \\"Why do you want that clap doctor?\\" Warren was duly commissioned as a colonel in the United States Army Medical Corps on November 3, 1943. He was appointed as chief of the MED's medical section and medical advisor to the director of the Manhattan Project, with Friedell as his deputy. Warren's office was initially located in New York City but moved to Oak Ridge, Tennessee soon after. Warren's initial task was to staff hospitals at Oak Ridge, Richland, Washington and Los Alamos, New Mexico. Warren's section was responsible for medical research, but also for the MED's health and safety programs. This presented an enormous challenge, because workers were handling a variety of toxic chemicals, using hazardous liquids and gases under high pressures, working with high voltages used in novel ways, and performing experiments involving explosives, not to mention the largely unknown dangers presented by radioactivity and handling fissile materials. Yet in December 1945, the National Safety Council presented the Manhattan Project with the Award of Honor for Distinguished Service to Safety in recognition of its safety record. Between January 1943 and June 1945, there were 62 fatalities and 3,879 disabling injuries, which was about 62 percent below that of private industry. Warren was personally responsible for the safety aspects of the Trinity nuclear test on 16 July 1945 at Alamogordo, New Mexico. There was considerable concern about radioactive fallout and a network of geiger counters was established to track the fallout cloud. Groves found Warren at the base camp shortly after the explosion and was displeased to discover that Warren had been awake for the previous 48 hours. Groves had US Navy Captain George Lyons take over so Warren could get some rest. Fortunately, no problems arose with the test. Aerial view of the Able mushroom cloud rising from the lagoon with Bikini Island visible in the background. The cloud carried the radioactive contaminants into the stratosphere. The atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were carried out on 6 and 9 August 1945. On 11 August, Groves phoned Warren and ordered him to organize a survey team and proceed to Guam, and thence to Japan to evaluate the effect of the atomic bombs and take measures to insure the safety of Allied troops occupying the cities. Initially the survey team was to accompany the assault troops of the III Amphibious Corps and the V Amphibious Corps in the invasion of Japan, but Japan surrendered on 14 August, the day the survey team departed San Francisco by air. The survey team arrived on Tinian on 17 August, where it was split into two parties, one under Warren and the other under Friedell. Warren's party, equipped with portable geiger counters, arrived in Hiroshima by air on 8 September as part of a group headed by Brigadier General Thomas F. Farrell that also included Brigadier General James B. Newman Jr and Japanese Rear Admiral Masao Tsuzuki, who acted as a translator. They remained in Hiroshima until 14 September and then surveyed Nagasaki from 19 September to 8 October. They were impressed by both the damage done by the atomic bombs and the extensive Japanese preparations for an American invasion. The detonation of the two atomic bombs in Japan \\"raised as many military and medicomilitary questions as they answered\\". A series of nuclear tests was planned, codenamed Operation Crossroads. Some 42,000 personnel were deployed to Bikini Atoll as part of Admiral William H. P. Blandy's Joint Task Force 1 to conduct the test. Their health and safety was Lyons's responsibility, but the specialised job of radiological safety was handled by the Manhattan Project. Warren, as Chief of the Radiological Safety Section (RADSAFE), planned and implemented measures to assess, limit and control the impact of radiation. Teams were given special training at Oak Ridge in the operation of instrumentation to measure radioactivity, and the interpretation of their readings. Training was also conducted aboard en route to Bikini Atoll, where it arrived on 12 June 1946. In all, some 3,500 personnel were assigned to RADSAFE. Warren was appalled by the effects of radioactive contamination on the environment. \\"The deadly range of radioactive products from the atomic bomb has been clearly demonstrated under controlled conditions...\\" he wrote, \\"the only defense against atomic bombs still lies outside the scope of science. It is the prevention of atomic war.\\" Warren left the Army on 6 November 1946. He temporarily became the Chief of the Medical Section of the Atomic Energy Commission, the civilian agency which succeeded the Manhattan Project. In February 1947, he was replaced by Dr Shields Warren. For his services with the Manhattan Engineer District. Warren was awarded the Army Distinguished Service Medal and the Legion of Merit. University of California Toward the end of World War II, a group of physicians proposed that the University of California should establish a medical school in Southern California. One of them was the urologist Elmer Belt, whose patients included the Governor of California, Earl Warren. The University of California Board of Regents voted to establish a medical school as part of the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) on October 19, 1945. In 1946 the California State Legislature unanimously voted $7 million to establish the new school, and Earl Warren signed it into law. In 1947, Warren was appointed the new school's first dean. Once again he found himself involved in creating a new medical school. His first appointments were three former associates in Rochester: Dr Charles Carpenter as the first professor of infectious disease; Dr. Andrew H. Dowdy as the first professor of radiology; and Dr John S. Lawrence, who had pioneered the use of phosphorus-32 as a radioactive tracer, as professor of medicine. With Dr William P. Longmire Jr, a 34-year-old plastic surgeon from Johns Hopkins University recruited by Lawrence as professor of surgery, they became the \\"Founding Five\\" of the new school. Initially, the new school was accommodated in wartime Quonset huts scattered about the UCLA campus. Warren was still wearing his army fatigues. Construction of permanent accommodation commenced in 1949. By 1951 when the first students, 26 men and two women, arrived there were 15 faculty members. By the time the first class graduated in 1955 there were 43 faculty members. The UCLA Medical Center opened in 1955. Under Warren's leadership, the school grew steadily, adding Schools of Dentistry, Nursing, and Public Health. Against some influential opposition, Warren established his medical school on the UCLA campus rather than in another part of the city. He strove to integrate not only the structures but the faculty with other departments of the university. He fostered the development of a major biomedical library as both a tangible and intellectual link between the life sciences and the health sciences. Warren became Vice Chancellor, Health Services in 1962. From 1963 to 1965 he served as special assistant to President John F. Kennedy and later Lyndon B. Johnson on mental retardation. Returning to UCLA in 1965, he became professor emeritus, a position he held until his death in 1981. His first wife Viola died in 1963 and on July 18, 1970 he married Gertrude Turner Hubberty. In 1971, Warren was awarded the Enrico Fermi Award. His citation read: He died on July 26, 1981 in Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles. He was survived by his wife and three children. His papers are in the UCLA Library, Department of Special Collections.

All taxation is ultimately overseen by the Bhutan Ministry of Finance, Department of Revenue and Customs, which is part of the executive Lhengye Zhungtshog (cabinet). The modern legal basis for taxation in Bhutan derives from legislation. Several acts provide for taxation and enforcement only germane to their subject matter and at various levels of government, while a smaller number provide more comprehensive substantive tax law. As a result, the tax scheme of Bhutan is highly decentralized. The duty to pay taxes is affirmed by the Constitution of 2008 individually as well as in commerce. The Constitution also confirms the ability of local governments to raise taxes in accordance to laws passed by Parliament. Under the Constitution, taxation is specifically disqualified as the subject of national referenda, leaving tax laws within the exclusive purview of Parliament. Individual and corporate taxation Bhutanese law generally provides for individual and corporate taxation based on income, sales, imports, and movable and immovable property. Bhutan has regulated corporations since 1989, most recently under the Companies Act of 2000. These regulations include taxation of corporate income. As of 2011, Bhutan's Corporate Income Tax rate was 30 percent on net profits; in addition, the Business Income Tax was another 30 percent on net profits. In 2000, Bhutan enacted its Sales Tax and Customs Excise Act. The Act sets forth the duty to pay sales tax and excises on goods and services within Bhutan as well as customs on imports according to rates and schedules published by the Ministry of Finance. The Act also provides Department of Revenue and Customs agents broad authority to inspect, confiscate, demand accounting, and to detain, fine, and prosecute those who contravene the tax laws. The Act also sets forth a procedural framework for resolving disputes, which may be appealed to the Royal Court of Justice. The Income Tax Act of 2001 represents the first modern, comprehensive Act on income taxation in Bhutan, for both individuals and companies. The Act also provides for sales tax, bankruptcy, and administrative processes for hearing disputes. As of 2011, the Department of Revenue and Customs imposes no taxes on the first Nu.100,000 of income; taxes up to Nu.250,000 at 10%; up to Nu.500,000 at 15%; up to Nu.1,000,000 at 20%; and Nu.1,000,001 and above at 25%. In addition, property transfers are taxed at 5%. Rural taxes are also imposed on land, houses, and cattle. Other direct duties includes the motor vehicle tax, foreign travel tax, royalties, business and professional licenses, health contribution taxes, and municipal taxes. As part of Bhutan's program of decentralization, local governments and municipalities ‚Äì including dzongkhags, gewogs, and thromdes, have been authorized to collect property, services, and transactional taxes since at least 1991. Notably, the Local Government Act of 2009 allows thromdes (municipalities) to levy a separate tax on vacancy and underdevelopment. Other legislation authorizes or imposes taxes against particular subject matter. For example, the Tobacco Control Act of 2010 requires persons importing tobacco to pay a tax and to furnish proof of payment upon demand. Like many such laws, the Tobacco Control Act defines a set of offenses and penalties for contravening its taxation provisions. Use of tax money The government either allocates tax revenues for specific state expenditures or deposits them into a Consolidated Fund. The government uses the Consolidated Fund according to budgets passed by law, and may also make grants and investments for the public interest. The national budget is overseen by the Finance Minister, who reports regularly to the National Assembly. The Pay Commission, an independent government body, establishes the pay rate and expenditure budget for members of government. Public expenditure of collected funds is governed by the Public Finance Act of 2007. Tax exemptions Under the Constitution of Bhutan, the Royal Family receives annuities set by Parliament and is exempted from taxation. Registered civil society organizations (\\"CSOs\\") are exempt from tax on income or other gains earned as a result of investing endowed property or other funds in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Department of Revenue and Customs. The two types of CSO, Public Benefit and Mutual Benefit Organizations, may be granted exemptions from customs duties or other taxes besides income taxes on a case by case basis under sets of regulations and procedures issued jointly by the Civil Society Organizations Authority and the Department of Revenue and Customs. No customs or duties are levied on goods imported into Bhutan from India, as per the nations' Agreement on Trade and Commerce. Foreign diplomatic missions, international organisations, and government agencies are generally exempted from paying customs duties and sales tax. Under the Sales Tax Act, the Ministry of Finance may also exempt any other person from sales, customs, and excise taxes at its discretion. Organizations exempt from customs duties must still pay sales tax when importing goods into Bhutan, however. Vehicle import tax controversy Taxation has been a topic of controversy since democratization in Bhutan. In June 2010, the first democratically elected government of Bhutan revised the import duty scheme on imported light private vehicles, raising taxes without following the procedures for bicameral presentment and debate required by the Constitution. The move was supported by some Bhutanese as curbing congestion and pollution while promoting mass transit development. The National Assembly opposition party contested the action in the High Court of Bhutan, Constitutional Bench, winning the initial suit. On appeal to the Supreme Court of Bhutan, the Attorney General argued that the tax revision was supported by pre-constitutional laws on direct and indirect taxation that remained unrepealed. The Attorney General also argued against judicial reviewability of political actions, a position based largely in United States jurisprudence developed by Louis Brandeis and supported by American case law. In December 2010, while the lawsuit was pending, the government ordered a halt of all imports subject to the tax, a move the opposition criticized as contempt of court. On February 24, 2011, the Supreme Court unanimously affirmed the High Court ruling against the government. The government lifted the import ban in early March 2011 and stated its intention to refund the taxes it had collected illegally, although it may reintroduce the tax revisions and pass them in the constitutional process. The government, though shaken by the ruling, has declared it will not resign over the debacle. After the controversy, the World Bank in its Financial Management Accountability Assessment warned that Bhutan's financial matters needed better legislative scrutiny. The World Bank cited inadequate examination and debate in Parliament before passing budgets, which include tax schedules. Furthermore, the World Bank decried the inability of Parliament to modify proposed budgets, but only to ratify proposals of the Ministry of Finance. History During the reign of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal (1594‚Äì1651), taxes in Bhutan were levied by penlops (regional governors). In 1865, Ashley Eden described the taxation in Bhutan as not so much a system as \\"squeez[ing] as much as possible out of the people under them.\\" Modernly, governmental authority was fully consolidated in 1907 with the establishment of the Wangchuck Dynasty and the modern state of Bhutan. Before the 1960s, the Bhutanese government collected taxes in kind and in the form of \\"labor contribution\\". Taxes in kind were gradually phased out in favor of nominal monetized taxes on land, property, business income, and consumption of good and services. In 1961, the National Assembly established the Gyaltse Kha Lowa (Accounts and Audit Committee) to oversee government revenue and properties. In 1968, the National Assembly made the Gyaltse Kha Lowa into the Ministry of Finance under the impetus of increasing development. In 1971, the Ministry saw the establishment of its Department of Customs, later to become the Department of Revenue and Customs, responsible for implementing much of the tax law. In 1974, the Royal Government began experimenting with decentralization, devolving some governmental powers ‚Äì including taxation ‚Äì to the municipalities of Thimphu and Phuntsholing. The Bhutanese government enacted major reforms to the tax structure in 1989 and again in 1992. The reforms of 1989 included Bhutan's first business income tax, replacing its previous 2% turnover tax; abolishing export and nuisance taxes; and exempting plant machinery from sales and import duties. The 1992 reforms aimed to simplify administrative procedures for compliance and transparency.

He became an ace twice over; once while flying Sopwith Pups and again while piloting Sopwith Camels. Early life Arnold Jacques Chadwick was born in Toronto, Ontario, Canada on 23 August 1895. Note: Franks names the month and year; the date is taken from The Aerodrome website elsewhere referenced. He was the only son of C. W. Chadwick; the elder Chadwick was the manager of Colonial Realty Corporation. World War I Chadwick joined the Royal Naval Air Service and was commissioned as a temporary Flight Sub-Lieutenant on 30 December 1915. He originally served in 5 Naval Wing after being trained. On 2 October 1916, while on a bombing raid aimed at Zeppelin hangars, he was shot down. He managed to evade capture and escape to the neutral country of the Netherlands. Once repatriated, Chadwick was assigned to 4 Naval Squadron in Bloody April 1917. Using a Sopwith Pup dubbed DO-DO, he scored his first aerial victory on 26 April 1917, driving down a German Albatros D.II fighter plane out of control. On 25 May 1917, Chadwick destroyed an Albatros reconnaissance two-seater in the vicinity of Bray Dunes in the early morning. That same evening, he teamed with Langley Frank Willard Smith and two other British pilots to attack and destroy a German Gotha G multi-engine bomber north of Westende. The following day, he shared in a victory southwest of Furnes, when he and Albert Enstone destroyed a German recon machine. On 3 June 1917, he crashed an Albatros D.V to become an ace on Sopwith Pups. Naval 4 then upgraded to Sopwith Camels. Chadwick would first score with one of them on 25 June, when he flambeed an Albatros recon two-seater over Roulers. On 3 July 1917, he drove down a German recon machine over Ghistelles. Three days later, he would share in the destruction of an Albatros two-seater in the same area. On a 10 July evening patrol, he drove down an Albatros D.V, then aided Ronald M. Keirstead to drive down a second one. Chadwick was now a Camel ace. On 25 July 1917, Chadwick, Enstone, and Keirstead joined to destroy a German seaplane northward of Ostend. It was Chadwick's final victory. Three days later, he singlehandedly assaulted a formation of nine German airplanes. Losing the battle, he was forced to ditch in the English Channel off the coastal town of La Panne. His drowned corpse would wash ashore near Dunkirk on 17 August 1917 On 11 August 1917, Chadwick was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross in an unusual joint citation. He, Albert Enstone, Langley Frank Willard Smith, and Alexander MacDonald Shook were cited for: \\"...exceptional gallantry and remarkable skill and courage whilst serving with the R.N.A.S. at Dunkirk during May and June, 1917, in repeatedly attacking and destroying hostile aircraft.\\" Arnold Jacques Chadwick is buried in Plot G.1 at Adinkerke Military Cemetery, Adinkerke, Arrondissement Veurne, West Flanders (West- Vlaanderen), Belgium.Findagrave website at https://www.findagrave.com/cgi- bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid;=116644916 and https://www.findagrave.com/cgi- bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GSln;=chadwick&GSfn;=arnold&GSmn;=jacques&GSbyrel;=all&GSdyrel;=all&GSob;=n&GRid;=11977577&df;=all&.

The association represented marine stewards and stewardesses, marine pantrymen and crew attendants. The union operated a closed shop, with all workers employed in the industry members of the union, and operated on a 'no OK card - no job' principle. The Association amalgamated with the Seamen's Union of Australia in 1988.  Politics  For most of its history the union had poor relations with the more radical, left-wing maritime trade unions due to the strong communist influence in these organisations, and was aligned with the right wing of the Labor movement, as represented by the Democratic Labor Party. The Marine Stewards' Association resisted industry-wide strike action in August 1935, when members of the Seamen's Union of Australia advocated a strike over pay and conditions.Fitzpatrick, Brian and Cahill, Rowan J. (1981). The Seamen's Union of Australia 1872-1972: A History. Sydney: Seamen's Union of Australia. . The Marine Stewards' Union was the first maritime union to admit women into its membership, albeit initially in very low numbers and only on passenger ships. Robert James (Bob) Heffron was for a number of years in the 1920s the Secretary of the NSW Branch of the Federated Marine Stewards and Pantrymen's Association, and between 1959 and 1964 was Premier of New South Wales.  Amalgamation  Despite a long history of proud independence, the association began to consider amalgamation during the 1980s, as generational change reduced animosity with other maritime trade unions, and changes in the industry, such as automation and a reduction in passenger travel by sea, reduced the membership base. The process of amalgamation with the Seamen's Union was initiated in 1985, and completed in 1988. Amalgamation reduced the cost of running a small organisation, and allowed more concerted action on board ships, where previously up to 8 separate unions could have had coverage on a ship of 40, with each union holding separate meetings. The greater industrial strength of the new SUA (later to amalgamate with the Waterside Workers' Federation to become the Maritime Union of Australia) led to achievements, including new hiring arrangements which gave greater job security to ships' stewards.

He arrived in Canada on July 1, 1884 and engaged in the building trade while living in Victoria. In 1894 he moved to Burnaby where he acquired a five-acre parcel of land which today forms the north east section of Central Park. Patterson worked as an engineer for Armstrong Morrison & Balfour and later became foreman boilermaker for the Vancouver Engineering Works. He founded Vulcan Iron Works of New Westminster in 1903, was the first postmaster of the Edmonds district in 1909 and was a member of the New Westminster Board of Trade in 1911. He was elected a Burnaby school trustee in 1912, was a director of the British Columbia Electric and Water Heat Company and owned and operated a real estate business where he purchased and developed properties as far away as Barkerville. He also founded and operated an insurance company for many years. Patterson Avenue, which he originally cleared as a trail, and Patterson station, where he built the original interurban stop along the British Columbia Electric Railway, are named for the family. Patterson was born in Partick, Lanarkshire, Scotland on January 2, 1860. He was one of three sons born to John Murdoch Paterson of Rutherglen, and Margaret (Purdon) Paterson of Partick. He attended the Glasgow common school, and worked as a ship joiner at Barclay Curle & Company (founded in 1818) in Whiteinch, Scotland. He was later employed in the Anchor Line Shipyards (founded in 1856) in Partick. After his arrival in Canada, he added a second \\"t\\" to the spelling of his last name which changed it from \\"Paterson\\" to \\"Patterson\\". On February 7, 1891 in Victoria, British Columbia, he married Frances Mabel Webb, a granddaughter of Thomas Webb, founder of Thomas Webb & Sons makers of fine English glass. Together, Dugald and Frances Patterson raised seven children. In 1915, during World War I, Patterson accepted a commission by the British government to travel overseas to supervise a group of Canadians in the construction of submarines for the Royal Navy on the River Clyde near Glasgow, Scotland. It was here that he sustained an injury which left him in a wheelchair for the rest of his life. Upon his return home, he remained active in both municipal affairs and the arts. He developed a plan that would preserve ravines as parks in Burnaby, and he published a book of poetry prior to his death in Vancouver in 1931. The family home, known today as Dugald and Frances Patterson House, has been a heritage landmark in Burnaby since 1994, and is listed on the \\"Canada's Historic Places\\" website.

Early years Armitage was born on 21 December 1906 in Nungambakkam, Madras, the first child of Frank and Muriel Armitage. His father was commissioner of police in Madras city. At the age of ten he was sent to Highfield School at Liphook, Hampshire, where he was captain of the cricket team in his final year. From 1920 to 1925 he attended Winchester College. He became a district and secretariat officer in Kenya. Armitage married Gwladys Lyona Meyler (b. 2 May 1906, Natal) on 18 February 1930 in Highlands Cathedral, Nairobi, Kenya. Their children were Robert Jeremy, born on 16 June 1932 in Poole, Dorset, England and Richard Hugh Lyon, born on 30 May 1937 in Canford Cliffs, Dorset, England. Gold Coast In July 1948, Armitage was financial secretary of the Gold Coast. After the governor had said he was willing to consider the creation of an agricultural bank, Armitage said his government was \\"deeply committed in principle\\" to taking action and \\"would find it difficult to retreat\\". In 1949, Armitage was chairman of a committee to consider establishing a national bank. He tried to dampen nationalist demands by ruling out the idea of a Reserve Bank, but did not succeed. By 1950, Armitage was Minister of Finance of the Gold Coast. At the end of 1950 the colonial government proposed to increase export duties on cocoa. The world price for the crop was rising, and the government felt that the planters would waste increased profits on luxuries, while the government would use it for development plans. Armitage was prepared to face opposition from cocoa producers, but prayed for five years of rising world prices to solve all economic problems. Armitage recommended appointment of a first-rate economic expert to manage the economy during the cocoa boom. He said the country \\"is rapidly moving out of the extremely restricted economy of the years before the war and so the holder should be someone who has experience of financial and economic matters, at least in other parts of Africa and possibly experience from other parts of the world\\". In his budget speech in 1953, Armitage explained the policy he had followed: \\"(Sterling) balances have accrued ... largely because the raw materials produced in the Gold Coast, mainly cocoa, have brought in large earnings and the Government ... increased taxation partly in an endeavor to lessen the amount of money which would exert an inflationary pressure ... and partly to build reserves.\\" Armitage did not mention that the project to build the Akosombo Dam over the Volta River was starting to seem feasible, and funds would be needed for that purpose. The Gold Coast gained independence in 1957 as Ghana. Cyprus Armitage was Governor of Cyprus from 1954 until 25 September 1955. At the time of his appointment there was growing agitation by the Greek Cypriots for enosis, or union with Greece, although this was opposed by the Turkish Cypriots. The Greek government supported the movement, but the British did not want to give up an important base in the eastern Mediterranean. Few of the Greek Cypriots were willing to compromise. In September 1954, Armitage said that the self- styled moderates had \\"no organisation, no party, no funds, no agents and they will win nothing\\". An attempt was made on Armitage's life on 1 April 1955. Bombs exploded all over the island on that day as EOKA insurgents opened a violent campaign for self-determination. Armitage asked for permission to declare a state of emergency in July 1955, in response to the EOKA insurrection, but this was not granted. He was nervous of loss of control, wanted to \\"nip trouble in the bud\\" by detaining leading members of EOKA and he was allowed to try to detain its more militant members under the Detention of Persons Law of 15 July 1955.Simpson (2002), pp. 20-1 For several months Armitage tried to find a way to deport Archbishop Makarios and the Bishop of Kyrenia, both of whom publicly supported union with Greece. Existing laws did not cover the situation of the Archbishop, who advocated a peaceful approach. A state of emergency was eventually declared, which allowed for deportation without cause. By then, Armitage had been replaced as governor by Field Marshal Lord Harding of Petherton, leaving office in September 1955. Nyasaland Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland =Unrest and State of Emergency= Armitage arrived in Nyasaland on 9 April 1956 to take over from Geoffrey Colby as Governor. One of the main issues he had to face was the unpopularity of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, which had come into being in 1953. He resisted proposals to \\"federalize\\" administration of European farming by the creation of a Federal ministry, while leaving African agriculture a responsibility of each of the three territories. He considered that this would result in the diversion of resources away from African agriculture, a serious concern for the indigenous population. He also resisted moves to make the Federation independent. He said that moving too quickly towards the status of a Dominion could \\"stimulate early and violent African opposition, which would at best discredit Federation and at the worst break it\\". In September 1957 he met a delegation from the Nyasaland African Congress headed by its president TDT Banda, who asked for legislative reforms including an elected legislative assembly with most members elected by Africans. He also met representatives of Charles Matinga's Progressive Party, who were seeking to follow a more moderate path, with nominated representatives to work with the government. He summarised the views of Matinga's party as: \\"In other words they wanted a lot of friendly Africans and Europeans to collaborate with friendly officials. But, of course, politics cannot be this easily organized\\". Several of the younger members of the Nyasaland African Congress had little faith in the ability of T D T Banda, who they also accused of dishonesty, and wished to replace him with Dr Hastings Banda (no relation), then living in the Gold Coast. Dr Banda announced he would only return if given the presidency of Congress: after this was agreed he returned to Nyasaland in July 1958 and T D T Banda was ousted. Banda and Congress Party leaders started a campaign of direct action against federation, for immediate constitutional change and eventual independence. As this included resistance to Federal directives on farming practices; protests were widespread and sometimes violent. In January 1959, Banda presented the Congress proposals for constitutional reform to Armitage. These were for an African majority in the Legislative Council and at least parity with non-Africans in the Executive Council. Armitage rejected these proposals, and this led to demands within Congress for an escalation of anti-government protests and more violent action. On 18 February 1959 there was an attack on the airstrip at Fort Hill by a mob armed with pangas. As Congress supporters became more violent and Congress leaders made increasingly inflammatory statements, Armitage decided against offering concessions, but prepared for mass arrests. Armitage had discussions with Roy Welensky the Prime Minister of the Federation, Southern Rhodesia officials and Sir Arthur Benson the Governor of Northern Rhodesia. These meetings coordinated plans to for mass arrests of members of the nationalist parties of each of the three territories, declaring a State of Emergency in any of them where this was considered necessary, and to send European troops from Southern Rhodesia to Nyasaland. On 21 February, European troops of the Rhodesia Regiment were flown into Nyasaland and, in the days immediately following, police or troops opened fire on rioters in several places, leading to four deaths. In deciding to make widespread arrests covering almost the whole Congress organisation, Armitage was influenced by a report received by the police from an informer of a meeting of Congress leaders at which, it was claimed by the Head of Special Branch that the indiscriminate killing of Europeans and Asians, and of those Africans opposed to Congress was planned, the so-called \\"murder plot\\". There is no evidence that such a plan existed, and the Nyasaland government took no immediate action against Banda or other Congress leaders but continued to negotiate with them until late February. On 3 March 1959 Sir Robert Armitage, as governor of Nyasaland, declared a State of Emergency over the whole of the protectorate and arrested Dr. Banda, the president of the Nyasaland African Congress, other members of its executive committee and over a hundred local party officials: Congress was banned the next day. Those arrested were detained without trial, and the total number detained for Congress membership finally rose to over 1,300. Over 2,000 more were imprisoned for offences against the Emergency Regulations, including rioting and criminal damage. The stated aim of these measures was to allow the Nyasaland government to restore law and order after the increasing lawlessness following Dr Banda's return. Rather than calming the situation immediately, in the emergency that followed fifty-one Africans were killed and many more were wounded. =The Devlin and Armitage reports= In the debate in the House of Commons on 3 March 1959, Alan Lennox-Boyd, the Colonial Secretary, stated that it was clear from information received that Congress had planned the widespread murder of Europeans, Asians and moderate Africans, ‚Äú‚Ä¶in fact, a massacre was being planned\\" and, later in the same debate, the Minister of State at the Colonial Office, Julian Amery, reinforced what Lennox-Boyd had said with talk of a ‚Äú‚Ä¶conspiracy of murder\\" and \\"a massacre‚Ä¶ on a Kenyan scale\\". It was subsequently difficult for ministers to repudiate these statements. Harold Macmillan decided to set up a Commission of Inquiry headed by Lord Devlin, which exposed the failings of the Nyasaland administration, and concluded it had lost the support of those it governed. The Devlin Commission's report is the only example of a British judge examining whether the actions of a colonial administration in suppressing dissent were appropriate. Devlin's conclusions that excessive force was used and that Nyasaland was a \\"police state\\" caused political uproar. His report was largely rejected and the state of emergency lasted until June 1960. Macmillan not only broadly rejected the Devlin Report, which had taken several months to prepare, but engineered the production of the rival Armitage Report, which was prepared very quickly so it could be released on the same day as the Devlin Report. The Colonial Office obtained an early draft of the Devlin Commission‚Äôs report and passed a copy to Armitage, which he used to prepare a document attacking its findings. Armitage then joined a high level working party in London which drafted a despatch to counter the Devlin Report. =Leaving Nyasaland= The Nyasaland African Congress, which had been banned in 1958, was re-formed as the Malawi Congress Party in 1959. Banda's detention became a political issue in the 1959 general election in the United Kingdom, although the Conservatives retained power. Under pressure from the press, the government decided to release Banda in March 1960. Before Band's release, Armitage was involved in a further controversy. During the visit of Harold Macmillan to Blantyre in January 1960 as part of his African tour, a demonstration led by Malawi Congress Party activists against continued emergency restrictions and the Banda's imprisonment was witnessed by British and other journalists, some of whom reported that the police provoked a riot, which they suppressed with excessive and indiscriminate violence against demonstrators and spectators in which European officers were directly involved.Coffey (2015), pp. 158-9 Several British newspapers called for an impartial inquiry into the so-called \\"Blantyre riot\\", which Armitage resisted that the journalists had exaggerated, if not invented, claims of police brutality. However, the Colonial Secretary, Ian Macleod agreed under parliamentary pressure to a judge-led inquiry and instructed Armitage to arrange it.Coffey (2015), pp.161, 172 The ensuing Southworth Commission by Justice Frederic Southworth of the Nyasaland High Court was appointed by Armitage to inquire into the disturbances and, in particular into allegations of police brutality, including by two named senior European policeman. It was not mandated to inquire into press coverage.Kalinga (2012), pp. 435-7 Southworth cleared the Nyasaland police of brutality and heavily criticised British correspondents for distorting events. Southworth‚Äôs stinging attacks, less on the integrity of the journalists involved than about their personalities and apparent preconceptions about the use of force damaged his claim to be impartial.Coffey (2015), pp. 175-6, 178-9 The British Government was concerned by Southworth‚Äôs attacks on the press and minimise its adverse impact by having the report published as a Nyasaland Government document, not a British Government one, and by only making a short written parliamentary statement, avoiding any parliamentary debate.Power (2012), p. 194 The press coverage highlighted to the British public and parliament the strength of African opposition to the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland and the degree of coercion needed to preserve the Federation, and served to discredited Armitage.Coffey (2015), p. 186 Armitage had imprisoned Banda, not realising that he was the only African politician who could negotiate a credible constitution for the protectorate. Devlin's conclusion that there was no murder plot and that Banda was not involved in promoting violence opened the way for the British government to deal with him. Despite Lennox-Boyd's rejection of the Devlin Report, once Iain Macleod replaced him at the Colonial Office late in 1959, Devlin was approached for advice. Armitage, on the other hand, was discredited and he was seen by Macleod as an obstacle to progress. Although Macleod gave Armitage instructions to arrange for rapid constitutional advancement in May 1960, which set the country on the road to one-party rule., he advised Armitage to go on leave pending retirement in August 1960. Glyn Smallwood Jones became acting Governor until Armitage retired in April 1961. Armitage retired without returning to Nyasaland in April 1961. Armitage died in Amesbury, Wiltshire, England, on 7 June 1990 at the age of 83. He was buried in Bridstow, Herefordshire.

Two years later, when Caracas was invaded by the army of Jos√© Tom√°s Boves, he fled to Cuman√°. Some accounts say he remained there, teaching art, others say he travelled through the West Indies. Either way, after Venezuela became part of Gran Colombia, he returned to Caracas. In 1821, Carlos Soublette offered him the position of Corregidor, which he reluctantly accepted and, one year later, was promoted to Alcalde ordinario. From 1821 to 1823, he also worked on decorating the meeting room of the Cabildo.

He was born in the town of Guama, Yaracuy State, on June 30, 1809 and died in Caracas on February 9, 1887.  Biography  His parents were Jos√© Mar√≠a Fern√°ndez and Luisa P√°ez, sister of general Jos√© Antonio P√°ez. As the nephew of a General, he became familiar with the events and personalities of the Spanish American wars of independence at an early age. From 1821 to 1823, he studied drawing and watercolors at a studio operated by a retired French artillery captain named Lessabe (or Lasabe) in Caracas. He then went to New York City, where he continued his education with Mariano Velazquez de la Cadena and others. When he returned to Venezuela in 1827, he studied mathematics and topographical drawing at the Army Engineering Command in Puerto Cabello, and was later stationed in Bogot√° and Cartagena. During this period he participated in the punitive expedition under Daniel Florence O'Leary that went to Antioquia to suppress the revolt of General Jos√© Mar√≠a C√≥rdova against the dictatorship of Sim√≥n Bol√≠var. After the breakup of Gran Colombia, he was invited by the Italian geographer Agust√≠n Codazzi to participate in creating a survey map of Venezuela. This work lasted from 1833 to 1839, during which time he made miniatures and engravings to include with the maps. He went to Paris with Codazzi in 1840 to oversee the printing of the maps by Thierry Fr√®res, a well-known lithography firm, where Codazzi published the Atlas f√≠sico y pol√≠tico de la Rep√∫blica de Venezuela. On the same trip, he developed some of the drawings for the Resumen de la historia de Venezuela by Rafael Mar√≠a Baralt and Ram√≥n D√≠az. Cover of the \\"Physical and Political Atlas of Venezuela\\", drawn by Fern√°ndez. (1840) In 1842, the Venezuelan government appointed a commission to repatriate the remains of Sim√≥n Bol√≠var from Santa Marta, an event that Fernandez recorded with about twenty drawings. Several of them were lithographed by the firm of Aagard, M√ºller and Stapler in 1844. Due to the strong enmity between his uncle, the General, and Jos√© Tadeo Monagas, the General's friends and family were persecuted so Fern√°ndez had to go into exile in 1849, to New Granada. In 1850, upon the recommendation of Codazzi, he was appointed to the \\"Comisi√≥n Corogr√°fica\\", where he provided illustrations for descriptions written by the historian Manuel Anc√≠zar. He was, according to critics, the most qualified of the three painters who participated in the commission because he combined a skill for painting miniatures with a knowledge of topography. The prints he made during the project numbered about thirty, and are divided thematically into landscapes of natural phenomena, sites of historical and archaeological significance, roads, ethnic groups and customs. He resigned from this position in 1852, due to disagreements with the other members, and returned to Venezuela. Shortly after, he traveled to France to perfect his skills. He stayed there for a few years, then came back to Caracas to take an appointment as Director of the Institute of Fine Arts, a position he held until his death in 1887. Between 1870 and 1873, he created a series of tempera landscapes of Zulia State. He also decorated the Pa√©z's home in Valencia as well as designing the \\"Plaza de Bol√≠var\\" in Maracaibo and planning restorative work on Solano Castle in Puerto Cabello. His most famous work is his portrait of Bolivar, painted in 1873 and later used on several denominations of the Venezuelan Bol√≠var banknote.

He is regarded as the founder of the Scalp Level School of painting, a contemporary to the French Barbizon School of Naturalist painting. He is associated with the D√ºsseldorf school of painting. Life and work Born in an ethnically mixed part of Alsace, France, on January 17, 1826; Hetzel's family spoke primarily German and emigrated to the United States when he was aged two. They traveled from a Baltimore port to a neighborhood in Allegheny City (Deutschtown), in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Hetzel attended Allegheny City school and was apprenticed to a local sign- and house-painter. After four years' training, he earned an artisan's apprenticeship, painting the interior murals of riverboat public rooms and local Pittsburgh saloons. George was sent to the Kunstakademie D√ºsseldorf between 1847‚Äì49 and studied Da Vinci's Chiaroscuro (the use of light and dark shadows to heighten depth and drama), which became a signature stroke in his later works. It is thought that Hetzel was first introduced to the bucolic setting of Scalp Level (at the intersection of Paint Creek and Little Paint Creek outside of Johnstown, Pennsylvania) around 1866 during a fishing trip. He was then an instructor at the Pittsburgh School of Design for Women and encouraged his colleagues and students to make Scalp Level their summer retreat and work \\"en plein air\\". Hetzel exhibited at the National Academy in New York City between 1865-1882 and at the Pennsylvania Academy until 1891. He was included in the 1876 Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia and shown in the first Carnegie International in 1896. He also exhibited at the World's Columbian Exposition, 1892-1893. The J. J.

The type species is Y. sinensis. Y. sinensis was first described in 1973 as a new species of the erythrosuchid Vjushkovia. In 1985, it was reassigned as its own genus of rauisuchid. A 1992 study supported the original classification of Youngosuchus sinensis as an erythrosuchid, but more recent studies classify it as a \\"rauisuchian\\"-grade loricatan archosaur completely unrelated to Vjushkovia, which is most likely a synonym of Garjainia. Description Youngosuchus is known from a well-preserved skeleton recovered from the Kelamayi Formation in the Junggur Basin of Xinjiang, China. The skeleton, referred to as IVPP V 3239, includes a complete skull, cervical vertebrae, ribs, the pectoral girdle, and forelimbs. Youngosuchus has a large, deep skull with sharp recurved teeth. Osteoderms are not present on the skeleton, a possible indication that Youngosuchus did not have the body armor present in other early archosauriforms. Classification The skeleton of Youngosuchus was first described in 1973 by Chinese paleontologist Yang Zhongjian, better known as C.C. Young. Young described it as Vjushkovia sinensis, a third species of the erythrosuchid genus Vjushkovia. Erythrosuchids are basal archosauriforms that are closely related to Archosauria, the group that includes living crocodiles and birds. In 1985, Russian paleontologists N.N. Kalandadze and Andreii Sennikov erected Youngosuchus as a new genus for V. sinensis, naming it after Young. They considered the two other species of Vjushkovia to members of the erythrosuchid genus Garjainia, and reclassified Y. sinensis as a rauisuchid. Rauisuchids are more derived than erythrosuchids because they lie within Archosauria, specifically within the clade Crurotarsi. Youngosuchus lacks several common erythrosuchid features. The skull table of Youngosuchus is flat, while in erythrosuchids the same region is slightly depressed. The depression of erythrosuchids is a remnant of the pineal foramen that was present in more primitive reptiles. The lack of a depression in the skull table of Youngosuchus suggests that it belongs to a more derived group than erythrosuchids. Another difference between Youngosuchus and erythrosuchids can be seen in the antorbital fenestra, a hole in the skull in front of the eyes. In Youngosuchus, the fenestra is large and triangular, but lacks the depressed upper and front margins seen in the skulls of erythrosuchids. The assignment of Youngosuchus to Rauisuchidae was not widely accepted initially. Paleontologist J. Michael Parrish kept Y. sinensis as a species of Vjushkovia in his 1992 study of erythrosuchids, and continued to recognize Vjushkovia as a valid taxon distinct from Garjainia. Sennikov, along with paleontologist David J. Gower, rejected Parrish's conclusions in 2000 by considering V. triplocostata, the type species of Vjushkovia, a junior synonym of Garjainia prima. In his 2000 overview of rauisuchians, Gower did not consider Y. sinensis to be a synonym of G. prima, instead suggesting that it was a rauisuchid. Martin Ezcurra (2016)'s study of archosauromorph classification placed Youngosuchus as a close relative of the loricatan Batrachotomus, positioned far away from Garjainia (which was considered indistinguishable from Vjushkovia).

Detail of cartoon from Le Chat noir, January 17, 1885.Pierrot lunaire: rondels bergamasques (Moonstruck Pierrot: bergamask rondels) is a cycle of fifty poems published in 1884 by the Belgian poet Albert Giraud (born Emile Albert Kayenburgh), who is usually associated with the Symbolist Movement. The protagonist of the cycle is Pierrot, the comic servant of the French Commedia dell'Arte and, later, of Parisian boulevard pantomime.For Pierrot's general history, see Storey (1978). The early 19th-century Romantics, Th√©ophile Gautier most notably, had been drawn to the figure by his Chaplinesque pluckiness and pathos,Storey (1978), pp. 93‚Äì110. and by the end of the century, especially in the hands of the Symbolists and Decadents, Pierrot had evolved into an alter-ego of the artist, particularly of the so-called po√®te maudit.Lehmann; Palacio; Storey (1985), pp. 297‚Äì304. He became the subject of numerous compositions, theatrical, literary, musical, and graphic. Giraud's collection is remarkable in several respects. It is among the most dense and imaginatively sustained works in the Pierrot canon, eclipsing by the sheer number of its poems Jules Laforgue's celebrated Imitation of Our Lady the Moon (1886).On Laforgue, see Lehmann; Palacio; Storey (1978), pp. 139‚Äì55. Its poems have been set to music by an unusually high number of composers (see Settings in various media below), including one, Arnold Schoenberg, who derived from it one of the landmark masterpieces of the 20th century. Finally, it is noteworthy for the number of themes of the fin-de-si√®cle‚Äîwhich is to say, of Symbolism, the Decadence, and early Modernism‚Äîthat it elaborates within the tight confines of Giraud's verse form:For a full discussion of these themes, see Jean Pierrot. *the growing materialism and vulgarity of late-19th-century life, and the artist's flight into an interior world; *the quest of that artist for a purity and untrammeled freedom of the soul, often through a derangement of the senses (advocated most famously by Arthur Rimbaud) via the ecstasy of music or drugs like alcohol; *the deconstruction of romantic love, inspired in part by a skepticism √† la Arthur Schopenhauer and a growing scientific candor (which will result in Krafft-Ebing's Psychopathia Sexualis of 1886) about sex; *the dogging of young genius by disease, especially consumption, leading to the facile equation (elaborated notoriously in the Degeneration of Max Nordau) of modern art with degeneracy; *the assumption of a religious burden by the modern artist, and his or her consequent ascension as prophet; *the transmutation of art into a hermeticism (vide St√©phane Mallarm√©, T.S. Eliot, James Joyce) through which it can be enriched with sacred value, spared the gaze of the philistine, and engaged with the dissonant incongruities of modern life: Giraud's poems are non-linear fragments shored against Pierrot's ruins; *and yet finally: an undermining of the whole enterprise by self-mockery and irony, calling the high creative project (and the motives of the artist indulging in it) in doubt. Verse form, style, and structure Each of Giraud's poems is a rondel, a form he admired in the work of the Parnassians, especially of Th√©odore de Banville.Kreuiter, p. 59. (It is a \\"bergamask\\" rondel, not only because the jagged progress of the poems recalls the eponymous rustic dance, but also because 19th-century admirers of the Commedia dell'Arte characters [or \\"masks\\"] often associated them with the Italian town of Bergamo,As Giraud himself does, throughout the poems: see \\"To my Bergamask Cousin\\" (#13), \\"Spleen\\" (#15), \\"Perfumes of Bergamo\\" (#35), and \\"Pierrot's Departure\\" (#36). from which Harlequin is said to have hailed.) Unlike many of the Symbolist poets (though certainly not all: Verlaine, Mallarm√©, even the early Rimbaud and Laforgue, worked comfortably within strict forms), Giraud was committed to traditional techniques and structures as opposed to the comparatively amorphous constraints of free verse. He exclaimed to his friend Emile Verhaeren, after reading the latter's Les Moines (The Monks), \\"What I disapprove of with horror, what angers and irritates me is your improvising disdain for verse form, your profound and vertiginous ignorance of prosody and language.\\"Cited in Kreuiter, p. 61, n. 34. Such an attitude leads the critic Robert Vilain to conclude that, while Giraud shared \\"the Symbolists' concern for the careful, suggestive use of language and the power of the imagination to penetrate beyond the surface tension of the here-and-now\\", he was equally committed to a Parnassian aesthetic.\\"Pierrot lunaire: Cyclic Coherence in Giraud and Schoenberg\\", in Delaere and Herman, p. 130. He adheres to the sparer of the rondel forms, concluding each poem with a quintet rather than a sestet and working within rather strictly observed eight-syllable lines. As is customary, each poem is restricted to two rhymes alone, one masculine, the other feminine, resulting in a scheme of ABba abAB abbaA, in which the capital letters represent the refrains, or repeated lines. Within this austere structure, however, the language is‚Äîto use Vilain's words‚Äî\\"suggestive\\" and the imaginative penetration beneath the \\"here-and-now\\" daring and provocative. Like Laforgue after him, Giraud uses neologisms (\\"Bourr√®le!\\" [\\"Executioner!\\" or \\"Torturer!\\"]),Not found with this spelling in any dictionary, the word is apparently, as Kreuiter notes (p. 100), a fusion of the verb \\"bourreler\\" (to torment or torture) and the noun \\"bourreau\\" (executioner or torturer). unusual word choices (\\"patte\\" [which usually means \\"paw\\"] for Pierrot's foot), and ambiguities (\\"Arlequin porte un arc-en-ciel\\", meaning \\"Harlequin bears [or carries or wears] a rainbow\\")These last two examples are also discussed by Kreuiter, pp. 104, 76. to enrich the fantastic atmosphere of the poems. His syntax is sometimes elliptical or fractured, as in the first line of the cycle: \\"Je r√™ve un th√©√¢tre de chambre\\" (\\"I dream a chamber theater\\"), instead of the usual \\"Je r√™ve d'un th√©√¢tre de chambre\\".Noted by Kreuiter, p. 69. And the imagery, especially in the similes, traffics often in the jarringly unexpected. Sometimes it is lyrically tender (clouds are \\"like splendid fins/Of chameleonic fish of the sky\\" [12: \\"The Clouds\\"]);Henceforth all titles in parentheses (or, as here, brackets) refer to the poems in Giraud (1884); numbers that precede them indicate their placement in the cycle. sometimes it is shockingly brutal (Pierrot's thought of his \\"last mistress\\", the gallows, \\"is like a nail/That drunkenness drives into his head\\" [17: \\"The Gallows' Song\\"]). At its most dreamlike, it has a disturbing obscurity of reference (\\"sinister\\"‚Äîand unexplained‚Äî\\"black butterflies\\" swarm in the sky and blot out the sun [19: \\"Black Butterflies\\"]); at times it suspends all laws of materiality (a moonbeam penetrates the \\"varnished case\\" of a violin to caress its \\"soul\\" with its \\"irony\\"‚Äî\\"like a luminous white bow\\" [32: \\"Lunar Violin\\"]). The result is Dal√≠-esque: a series of sharply etched transcriptions of proto- Surreal visions.The composer Roger Marsh (2007b) writes that, \\"Reading poems about heads being drilled with cranium drillers [45: \\"Cruel Pierrot\\"] and omelettes being thrown into the night sky [7: \\"Lyrical Cuisine\\"], one could be forgiven for assuming that Giraud was associated with the Dadaists or Surrealists, but they were not to emerge for another thirty years\\" (p. 6). \\"With its Baroque intensity of detail and its fin de si√®cle aura\\", as Giraud's American translator writes, \\"Pierrot Lunaire is a work not to be forgotten.\\"Richter, pp. xxix‚Äìxxx. Because the rondel is such a tightly \\"closed\\" form, each poem seems to stand as an independent unit, isolated from the other poems around it. Giraud heightens this sense of disconnection by eschewing sustained narrative, presenting Pierrot's situation as a series of stark vignettes. Sometimes these vignettes are clustered rather coherently (as in those dealing with Pierrot-as-modern-Christ‚Äî27: \\"The Church\\", 28: \\"Evocation\\", 29: \\"Red Mass\\", and 30: \\"The Crosses\\"),As Marsh (2007a) puts it, \\"There is no single narrative, but rather...a number of mini-narratives...\\" (p. 110). But to go on to say, as he does, that the poems within these \\"mini- narratives\\" form \\"a logical sequence\\" (p. 110) seems to strain the meaning of \\"logical\\". but, more often than not, they seem random in their placement (and thus may be explained, at least in part, Schoenberg's not scrupling to change their order in his song-cycle).Marsh (2007a) is in complete disagreement on this point. \\"As poetic cycles go,\\" he writes, \\"Pierrot Lunaire has more coherence and narrative structure than most\\" (p. 110). But the narrative structure that he proceeds to trace (pp. 110‚Äì116) seems often to be imposed on the poems (see note 18 below). The effect of all these structural and stylistic techniques is both comic and unsettling, as the poem \\"Disappointment\\" (4: \\"D√©convenue\\") suggests: The scene is completely without context: the poem that precedes it, 3: \\"Pierrot-Dandy\\", is about Pierrot's making up his face with moonlight;But he is not said to be doing so in readiness \\"to meet his guests\\", as Marsh has it (2007a), p. 110; he is not given any motive for painting his face. This is one example of many that could be cited of Marsh's tendency to generate narrative where Giraud provides none‚Äîand even may be said to be actively suppressing it. the poem that follows it, 5: \\"Moon over the Wash-House\\", identifies the moon as a washerwoman. Nowhere else in the cycle is this party revisited; it is impossible, therefore, to understand the import of the gathering or the identity of the guests. (Are the \\"Gilles\\" among the guests? or are they part of the entertainment? Is it Pierrot who has whimsically stolen away the viands? or is it stingy Cassander?) The frozen gestures (\\"their forks in their fists\\"), the air of blank incomprehension (shared as much by the reader as by the guests), the finicking nicety of the language (\\"elytra\\" [pl. of \\"elytron\\" = \\"wing- case\\"]) all contribute to the ambiguous black comedy of the poem. Synopsis In a familiar dichotomy of the Symbolists, Pierrot lunaire occupies a divided space: a public realm, over which the sun presides, and a private realm, dominated by the moon.In Giraud's playlet Pierrot Narcisse (1887), Pierrot explains to Eliane that \\"there are two races\\" of men‚Äî\\"one enamored of activity and reality\\" and \\"entranced/By the splendid banality of life\\"; the other a \\"race of dreamers, of visionaries\\" who are \\"born under Saturn's sign\\". He concludes: \\"The one comes from the sun, the other from the moon;/And you would be doing better to unite the antelope with the shark/Than the sons of Pierrot with the daughters of Harlequin\\": in Giraud (1898), p. 223; tr. Storey (1978), p. 137, n. 17. The waking, sunlit world, populated by Pierrot's Commedia dell'Arte companions, is marked by deformity, degeneracy, avarice, and lust. Its Crispins are \\"ugly\\", and its Columbine \\"arches her back\\", apparently in expectation of sexual pleasure (1: \\"Theater\\"). The meretriciously multicolored Harlequin‚Äî\\"shining like a solar spectrum\\" (11: \\"Harlequin\\")‚Äîis an \\"artificial serpent\\" whose \\"essential goal\\" is \\"falsehood and deceit\\" (8: \\"Harlequinade\\"). An old serving-woman connives in his scheming by accepting a bribe to procure Columbine's favors (11: \\"Harlequin\\"). These puppets live under a sky swarming with \\"sinister black butterflies\\" that \\"seek blood to drink\\", having \\"extinguished the sun's glory\\" with their wings (19: \\"Black Butterflies\\"). The sun itself is nearing the end of that glory: at its setting it seems like a Roman reveler, \\"full of disgust\\", who slits his wrists and empties his blood into \\"filthy sewers\\" (20: \\"Sunset\\"). It is a \\"great sun of despair\\" (33: \\"The Storks\\"). Pierrot is of the dreaming, moonlit world. His is an enchanted interior space, in which sequestered violins are caressed by moonbeams, thereby setting their souls, \\"full of silence and harmony\\", thrumming (32: \\"Lunar Violin\\"). He lives there as an aloof isolato,Pierrot appears with companions (not counting the moon) in only two poems‚Äîwith brigand tipplers in 14 (\\"Pierrot the Thief\\") and with Harlequin and Columbine in 48 (\\"Supper on the Water\\"). Cassander also puts in an appearance with Pierrot, but as a victim only, not a companion: Pierrot dreamily draws a bow over his belly, like a viola, in 6 (\\"Pierrot's Serenade\\"); he knocks him out with a rope in 37 (\\"Pantomime\\") and bores a smoking-hole in his skull in 45 (\\"Cruel Pierrot\\"). encountering in a \\"sparkling polar icicle\\" a \\"Pierrot in disguise\\" (9: \\"Polar Pierrot\\") and seeking, \\"all along the Lethe\\", not Columbine the fickle woman but her ethereal floral namesakes‚Äî\\"pale flowers of moonbeams/Like roses of light\\" (10: \\"To Columbine\\"). The moon is, aptly, a \\"pale washerwoman\\" (5: \\"Moon over the Wash-House\\") whose ablutions minister chiefly to the mind. For Pierrot has lost the happy enchantments of the past: the moribund pantomimic world seems \\"absurd and sweet, like a lie\\" (37: \\"Pantomime\\"), and the \\"soul\\" of its old comedies, to which he sometimes mentally propels himself, with an imaginary oar of moonlight (36: \\"Pierrot's Departure\\"), is \\"like a soft crystal sigh\\" bemoaning its own extinction (34: \\"Nostalgia\\"). Now, at the end of the century, Pierrot resides in a \\"sad mental desert\\" (34: \\"Nostalgia\\"). He is bored and splenetic: \\"His strange, mad gaiety/Has flown away, like a white bird\\" (15: \\"Spleen\\"). Too often the moon seems like a \\"nocturnal consumptive\\" tossing about on the \\"black pillow of the skies\\", deceiving the \\"carefree lover passing by\\" into mistaking for \\"graceful rays/[Its] white and melancholy blood\\" (21: \\"Sick Moon\\"). When Pierrot cannot find relief in her customary magic‚Äîin the \\"strange absinthe\\" of her beams, this \\"wine that we drink with our eyes\\" (16: \\"Moon-Drunk\\")‚Äîhe takes pleasure in tormenting his enemies: he makes music by drawing a bow across Cassander's pot-belly (6: \\"Pierrot's Serenade\\"); he bores a hole in his skull as a bowl for his pipe (45: \\"Cruel Pierrot\\"). (Cassander is a target because he is an \\"academician\\" [37: \\"Pantomime\\"], a dry-as-dust guardian of the Law.) Madness seems to be lurking at Pierrot's elbow, as when he makes up his face with moonlight (3: \\"Pierrot- Dandy\\"), then spends an evening trying to brush a spot of it from his black jacket (38: \\"Moon-Brusher\\"). At his most despairing, he is visited by thoughts of his \\"last mistress\\"‚Äîthe gallows (17: \\"The Song of the Gallows\\"),Pierrot's relationship with the gallows, like his relationship with the moon, has its origin in folk verse. In a newspaper review of 1847, Gautier noted that French schoolboys have long inscribed their books with \\"a mysterious hieroglyphic representing a Pierrot hanged on a gibbet, beneath which one reads, as a kind of admonition, this meaningful legend in macaronic Latin\\": \\"Aspice Pierrot pendu/Quod librum n'a pas rendu;/Si Pierrot librum reddidisset/Pierrot pendu non fuisset [Behold Pierrot hanged/For not having returned a book;/If Pierrot had returned the book/He would not have been hanged]\\": tr. Storey (1985), pp. 113‚Äì114. at the end of whose rope he dangles in \\"his white Moon robe\\" (18: \\"Suicide\\"). That the moon, indeed, seems to connive in his extinction is suggested by its sometime appearance as \\"a white saber/On a somber cushion of watered silk\\" that threatens to come whistling down on Pierrot's neck (24: \\"Decapitation\\"). His consolation is that the art in which he resides will have eternal life: \\"Beautiful verses are great crosses/On which red Poets bleed\\" (30: \\"The Crosses\\"). The old succor of religion is replaced by that of poetry, but at a cost‚Äîand with a difference. What is summoned to \\"the altar of [these] verses\\" is not the gentle Mary but the \\"Madonna of Hysteria\\", who holds out \\"to the incredulous universe/[Her] Son, with his limbs already green,/His flesh sagging and decayed\\" (28: \\"Evocation\\"). To the assembled faithful, Pierrot offers his heart: \\"Like a red and horrible Host/For the cruel Eucharist\\" (29: \\"Red Mass\\"). The new Lamb of God is a consumptive, his Word a confession of both self-sacrifice and impotence. And yet, for all the harshness of this portrait, the tone of the poems lightens considerably towards the end of the cycle. The dance of a \\"fine pink dust\\" on the horizon announces the sunrise in poem 41 (\\"Pink Dust\\"); Pierrot joins Harlequin and Columbine for a sumptuous repast in poem 48 (\\"Supper on the Water\\"); and in one of the last vignettes in which Pierrot appears, he is the possessor of a \\"bright and joyous lantern\\" (44: \\"The Lantern\\"), marking a turn from the dark Symbolist world to the light. The poet and Pierrot Giraud's imagined identification of himself with his protagonist is complete; it is, in fact, often difficult to determine whether the subject of a given poem is Pierrot or Giraud.Jean de Palacio writes that, \\"While Pierrot is not confused with the writing 'I,' he shares with him a privileged rapport and is most often the 'I's' double\\" (p. 27). (To distinguish a \\"narrator\\" here is probably to make too nice a distinction.) The \\"I\\" that makes occasional appearances claims relation to Pierrot \\"through the Moon\\"; he lives, like Pierrot, \\"by sticking out. . ./[His] bleeding tongue at the Law\\" (13: \\"To my Bergamask Cousin\\"). Also like Pierrot, he \\"discovers drunken landscapes\\" in absinthe (22: \\"Absinthe\\") and savors the \\"morbid and mournful charm\\"‚Äî\\"Like a bloody drop of spittle/From a consumptive's mouth\\"‚Äîof melancholy music (26: \\"Chopin Waltz\\"). Both are nostalgic for Pierrot's past, that \\"adorable snow\\" of yesteryear, when the zanni of the old comedies was a \\"lyre-bearer,/Healer of wounded spirits\\" (31: \\"Plea\\"). And both are staunch in their commitment to an anti- materialistic idealism, Giraud seeing in the whiteness of Pierrot‚Äîand of snow, swans, and lilies‚Äîa \\"scorn of unworthy things\\" and a \\"disgust for weak hearts\\" (40: \\"Sacred Whitenesses\\"). Art they hold in worshipful regard: Giraud's book, his \\"poem\\", is \\"a ray of moonlight stoppered up/In a beautiful flagon of Bohemian glass\\" (50: \\"Bohemian Crystal\\"). But, paradoxically, both, as artists, are self-estranged: ironically, the interior quest for \\"sacred whitenesses\\", for a purity of soul, is synonymous with the assumption of a falsehood, a mask‚Äîone of theatrically clownish extravagance that borders on madness and fatal excess. In 39: \\"The Alphabet\\", an apparent anomaly in the cycle, in which Giraud imagines himself as Harlequin,He does so apparently because Harlequin, in his multicolored costume, is traditionally regarded as chameleonic. not Pierrot, the poet recalls dreaming, as a child, of \\"a multicolored alphabet,/In which each letter was a mask\\", a dream that agitates his \\"foolish heart\\" today. It is a revealing confession: an admission that the agents of his creations as an artist, the alphabet, are ideally not agents of self-expression but of self-fabrication under the mask of an Other. And this Other‚ÄîPierrot‚Äîis himself a fabrication, a mercurial puppet in a \\"chamber theater\\" of the mind (1: \\"Theater\\"). Pierrot lunaire offers a performance, not an expression, of the selfPalacio notes that, \\"[a]t the moment when the poet Albert Giraud ... puts distance between himself and Pierrot, he assimilates himself to him all the more strongly by stealing his origins, his costume, and the essence of his poetry\\" (p. 28). This view is in sharp contrast with that of Vilain, who argues that Giraud ends his cycle with an air of \\"solidly founded self-possession\\" (in Delaere and Herman, p. 131).‚Äîa fact in which much of its \\"modernity\\" resides. Settings in various media In 1892, the poet and dramatist Otto Erich Hartleben published a German translation of Pierrot lunaire; he retained the rondel form of the poems, but he attempted no rhymes, altered line lengths, and made other substantive changes. Some commentators see his versions as improvements on the originals, although recent criticism has shifted somewhat in Giraud's favor.Marsh (2007b) quotes Charles Rosen on Giraud the poet (\\"justly forgotten\\") and Susan Youens on the poems (\\"pallid pastels\\", providing a mere \\"draft\\" for Hartleben's \\"finished work\\"), then rejoins with some heat: \\"This is grossly unfair and demonstrably wrong\\" (p. 9). For a full assessment, see the Delaere and Herman collection. However their respective merits will eventually be judged, it was Hartleben's versions that first drew composers to the poems and that provide the texts for almost all of the early settings we have. The bullet-point that follows lists early 20th-century musical settings chronologically and notes the number of poems that were set by each composer (all, except Prohaska's, are in the Hartleben translations) and for which instruments. *Pfohl, Ferdinand: 5 poems (\\"Moon- rondels, fantastic scenes from 'Pierrot Lunaire'\\") for voice and piano (1891);Although Hartleben's translations did not appear in print until 1892, they were familiar earlier to the literary community through his readings: Marsh (2007a), p. 107. Marschalk, Max: 5 poems for voice and piano (1901); Vrieslander, Otto: 50 poems for voice and piano (46 in 1905, the remainder in 1911); Graener, Paul: 3 poems for voice and piano (c. 1908); Marx, Joseph: 4 poems for voice and piano (1909; 1 of 4, \\"Valse de Chopin\\", reset for voice, piano, and string quartet in 1917); Schoenberg, Arnold: 21 poems for speaking voice, piano, flute (also piccolo), clarinet (also bass clarinet), violin (also viola), and violoncello (1912); Kowalski, Max: 12 poems for voice and piano (1913); Prohaska, Carl: 6 poems for voice and piano (1920); Lothar, Mark: 1 poem for voice and piano (1921).\\"Appendix: Musical Pierrots around 1900\\" in Brinkmann, pp. 163ff. All of Schoenberg's settings and several by Vrieslander and Kowalski are gathered in the Musicaphon CD Pierrot: Ein Clown hinter den Masken der Musik/Pierrot: A Clown behind the Masks of Music (M 56837, 2001). (The collection also includes five Songs of Pierrot [1911] by Eduard K√ºnneke, set to poems by Arthur Kahane.) =Arnold Schoenberg and Pierrot lunaire= The most famous and important of these settings is Schoenberg's atonal Thrice-Seven Poems from Albert Giraud's \\"Pierrot lunaire\\", scored for what is now known as the Pierrot ensemble and a Sprechstimme voice. \\"For all the rough critical ride Schoenberg's compositions have received in general,\\" writes the musicologist Jonathan Dunsby, \\"Pierrot lunaire has come to be regarded since its first performance in 1912 as a masterpiece.\\" And he continues: > Wherever we look in the history of its reception, whether in general > histories of the modern period, in more ephemeral press response, in the > comments of musical leaders like Stravinsky or Boulez, in pedagogical > sources or in specialized research studies, the overwhelming reaction to > Pierrot has been an awestruck veneration of its originality.Dunsby, p. 1. The most obvious manifestation of that originality is the Sprechstimme required of its vocalist, and among those who have met its challenges should be mentioned Albertine Zehme (who commissioned the work and performed, dressed as Columbine, in its first productions), Bethany Beardslee, Jan DeGaetani, and Christine Sch√§fer. As an homage to Schoenberg, the English composers Peter Maxwell Davies and Harrison Birtwistle founded The Pierrot Players in 1967; they performed under that name until 1970.Hall, pp. 72-77. The similarly inspired Pierrot Lunaire Ensemble Wien, founded in Vienna by flautist Silvia Gelos and pianist Gustavo Balanesco, is still performing internationally. In 1987, the Arnold Schoenberg Institute in Los Angeles commissioned the settings of the remaining twenty-nine poems that Schoenberg had neglected, utilizing the Pierrot ensemble (Sprechstimme optional), by sixteen American composers‚ÄîMilton Babbitt, Leslie Bassett, Susan Morton Blaustein, Paul Cooper, Miriam Gideon, John Harbison, Donald Harris, Richard Hoffmann, Karl Kohn, William Kraft, Ursula Mamlok, Stephen L. Mosko, Marc Neikrug, Mel Powell, Roger Reynolds, and Leonard Rosenman. The settings were given their premieres between 1988 and 1990 in four concerts sponsored by the Institute.The Harris and Kraft cycles have been recorded and released on CD. (The director of the Institute, Leonard Stein, added a setting of his own to the final concert of the project.)Daniel Cariaga, \\"First eight premieres of 'Pierrot Project'\\", Los Angeles Times, February 5, 1988; Martin Bernheimer, \\"'Pierrot' sequels via Schoenberg Institute\\", Los Angeles Times, November 9, 1988; Gregg Wager, \\"Nine premieres in third 'Pierrot Project' concert\\", Los Angeles Times, January 27, 1989; Timothy Mangan, \\"Final installment of Pierrot Project at USC\\", Los Angeles Times, January 27, 1990. Schoenberg's Pierrot has kindled inspiration not only among fellow composers but also among choreographers and singer- performers. Dancers who have staged Pierrot lunaire include the Russian-born American Adolph Bolm (1926), the American Glen Tetley (1962), the German Marco Goecke (2010) and the French Kader Belarbi (2011). Also, the avant-garde Triadic Ballet (1923) by Oskar Schlemmer and Paul Hindemith was inspired by Schoenberg's song-cycle. The theatrical/operatic possibilities of Schoenberg's score have been realized by at least two major ensembles: the Opera Quotannis, which staged a version of Pierrot lunaire (with singer Christine Schadeberg) at the New School for Social Research in 1995 and, more recently, the internationally acclaimed contemporary music sextet eighth blackbird, which premiered a \\"cabaret opera\\" dramatizing the Schoenberg cycle in 2009. Its percussionist, Matthew Duvall, played Pierrot, and, in addition to the remaining five musicians and a singer/speaker, Lucy Shelton, the production included a dancer, Elyssa Dole. The work, which was toured in 2012 to mark the centennial of Schoenberg's composition of Pierrot lunaire, was conceived, directed, and choreographed by Mark DeChiazza. In the summer of 2014, the freelance curator Niamh White, composer Ewan Campbell, and pianist Alex Wilson founded the British arts collective The Pierrot Project in an attempt \\"to create events that combined both music and art, and to establish opportunities for talented young artists and musicians to work together in unique, informal settings for large cross-arts audiences.\\"\\"The Pierrot Studio\\", n.p. The first of its events unfolded in the fall of that same year, when the music group Dr. K Sextet, which had been born at London's Royal College of Music in 2009, performed extracts from Pierrot lunaire, accompanied by an exhibition of artworks responding to each of its three sections (October 2014); mounted a \\"Pierrot-Kabarett\\" featuring new settings of Schoenberg's Brettl-Lieder (January 2015); and offered original interpretive responses to the central \\"dark\\" section of Pierrot lunaire (April 2015).Antonia Couling, \\"After ArnoldDr K Sextet\\", Classical Music, April 2, 2015. Subsequently, the Project commissioned artists Tim A. Shaw, J√∂rg Obergfell, and Sara Naim to work with composers Ewan Campbell, Stef Conner, and Chris Roe to create \\"collaborative works that explore Sch√∂nberg's life, mind and work, for an exclusive 2 week showing at Display Gallery in London: 5th-17th February 2016,\\" preceded by a February 4th concert by the Dr. K Sextet, which performed among the resulting installations.\\"The Pierrot Studio\\", n.p. Known as The Pierrot Studio, this new project was staged in a \\"psychic, virtual or imagined\\" recreation of Schoenberg's own studio, furnished with \\"re-imaginings of Sch√∂nberg's 'miusical' sketches and painted self portraits.\\"\\"The Pierrot Studio\\", n.p. The programs included an abstract light-and-sound \\"rendering of Sch√∂nberg's moonscape in Pierrot Lunaire\\" and \\"a series of masks and musical motives\\" conjuring up \\"the various archetypal Pierrot characters.\\"\\"The Pierrot Studio\\", n.p. Schoenberg has attracted at least one prominent parodist: in 1924, Hanns Eisler, a student of Schoenberg, published Palmstr√∂m (Studies on 12-tone Rows), in which a Sprechstimme vocalist, singing texts by Christian Morgenstern, parodies the musical lines of Pierrot to the accompaniment of flute (or piccolo), clarinet, violin (or viola), and violincello. =Re-enter Giraud: the French poems renascent= Beginning in the early 1980s, scholars and musicians began to take a fresh look at Giraud's original texts, thereby initiating an implicit interrogation of the superiority of the Hartleben translations. Two works are especially illustrative of this development. The first, the volume Pierrot Lunaire, of 1982, is a retranslation of the Hartleben versions back into French by the poets Michel Butor and Michel Launay, who conclude their work with poems of their own inspired by Giraud. The second, Variations: Beyond Pierrot (1995), is a work by the American composer Larry Austin. Each of its three ten-minute sections features a Sprechstimme soprano who sings fragments of Schoenberg's 21 selections accompanied by flute, clarinet, violin, cello, and piano. She sometimes renders those fragments in Giraud's original French, sometimes in Hartleben's German, at other times in English and Japanese. Drawing upon live computer- processed sound and computer-processed prerecorded tape, the composition attempts (in Austin's words) to go \\"beyond Schoenberg's musical melodrama\\" to create a \\"multi-lingual dream of the essences of the poems\\".Quoted in Richter, p. xxix. In 2001 and 2002, the British composer Roger Marsh set all fifty of the original French poems for a (mostly) a cappella group of singers. Sometimes they sing in French accompanied by a narrator, whose English translations are woven into the music; sometimes they sing in both French and English; sometimes they speak the poems in both languages (in various combinations). The few songs entirely in French are intended to be glossed by action in performance. Instruments occasionally brought in, usually solo, are violin, cello, piano, organ, chimes, and beatbox. The English texts were derived from literal translations of Giraud's poems by Kay Bourlier.See Marsh (2007b), \\"The Translations\\", p. 18, as well as the notes on the individual tracks, pp. 3‚Äì5. Giraud's original texts (and apparently one of Hartleben's) also stand behind the Seven Pierrot Miniatures (2010) by the Scottish composer Helen Grime, though hers cannot be called \\"settings\\", since voice and words are absent. The seven poems she selected‚Äî12: \\"The Clouds\\", 2: \\"Decor\\", 22: \\"Absinthe\\", 18: \\"Suicide\\", 27: \\"The Church\\", 20: \\"Sunset\\", and \\"The Harp\\",Not in Giraud's cycle, \\"Die Harfe\\" is probably an original poem by Hartleben; see Richter's commentary, p. xxiii, and Marsh's note in (2007a), p. 107, n. 30. It is translated in Richter, p. 102. none used by Schoenberg‚Äîwere merely \\"points of departure\\" for her suite for mixed ensemble.Helen Grime, Programme Note. =Beyond both Giraud and Hartleben: Pierrot lunaire reimagined= In 2013, the Arab-American composer Mohammed Fairouz set the poet Wayne Koestenbaum's ten Pierrot Lunaire poems (2006)From Koestenbaum's collection Best-Selling Jewish Porn Films (New York: Turtle Point Press, 2006).‚Äîall original in content, though retaining titles from the Giraud/Schoenberg cycles‚Äîto a theatrical score for tenor and the Pierrot ensemble. In these new settings, Pierrot, \\"erotomane, cin√©aste, clown, troubadour, analysand, synaesthete\\", goes wandering \\"through circles of a moonlit inferno, where he confronts shadows of charmed, histrionic luminaries\\", including Susan Sontag, Virginia Woolf, Patty Duke, Mae West, and Diana Vreeland.Wayne Koestenbaum, quoted in Mohammed Fairouz, Pierrot Lunaire, Huffington Post, July 24, 2013. The painters Paul Klee, Federico Garc√≠a Lorca, Theodor Werner, Marc Chagall, Markus L√ºpertz, and Fernando Botero have all produced a Pierrot Lunaire (in 1924, 1928, 1942, 1969, 1984, and 2007, respectively). The British writer Helen Stevenson published a Chinese-box-like, postmodern set of variations on Giraud's poems in her 1995 novel Pierrot Lunaire,The would-be artist of that novel, Talbot Hardy, muses at one point that there must be \\"an original Pierrot Lunaire somewhere, of which they were making more and more perfect copies all the time\\" (p. 203). The student of postmodernism will rightly be suspicious of that \\"perfect\\". and Bruce LaBruce released his Canadian/German film Pierrot Lunaire, a gender-bending interpretation of the Schoenberg cycle, in 2014. Pierrot Lunaire is also a familiar figure in postmodern popular art: like the American experimental/drone music artist John DeNizio,Pierrot Lunaire Albums. Brazilian, Italian, and Russian rock groups have called themselves Pierrot Lunaire.The Russian group is always referred to in English as The Moon Pierrot, but the Russian name (–õ—É–Ω–Ω—ã–π –ü—ä–µ—Ä–æ) is translated more accurately as \\"Pierrot Lunaire\\". The Soft Machine, a British group, included the song \\"Thank You Pierrot Lunaire\\" in its 1969 album Volume Two; the Scottish musician Momus included the track \\"Pierrot Lunaire\\" in his 2003 album Oskar Tennis Champion; and the avant-pop star Bj√∂rk, known for her interest in avant-garde music, performed Schoenberg's Pierrot Lunaire at the 1996 Verbier Festival with Kent Nagano conducting. In 2011, the French graphic novelist Antoine Dod√© published the first volume of his projected trilogy, Pierrot Lunaire, and in issue #676 of DC Comics, Batman R.I.P.: Midnight in the House of Hurt (2008), Batman acquired a new nemesis, who shadowed him--and plotted against Robin, the Boy Wonder--for ten more issues: his name was Pierrot Lunaire.

Five years later, he enrolled at the Academy of Fine Arts in Caracas, where he studied with and Miguel Navarro Ca√±izares.Brief biography @ MCN Biograf√≠as. In 1875, he received a government scholarship that allowed him to study in Paris and Rome. He returned in 1881, with sketches of the Assumption of the Virgin, commissioned by Jos√© Antonio Ponte (1832-1883), the Archbishop of Caracas, that he used for murals at Caracas Cathedral, painted with the assistance of Crist√≥bal Rojas. In 1883, he portrayed the final moments of Sim√≥n Bol√≠var, to commemorate the centennial of Bol√≠var's birth. The following year, he travelled to Peru on behalf of Tovar, making sketches at the sites of the battles of Jun√≠n and Ayacucho for paintings that Tovar had been commissioned to create for the Palacio Federal Legislativo. As it turned out, Herrera had to complete the Battle of Ayacucho after Tovar's death. He later took up journalistic pursuits in addition to painting, signing his writings with the pseudonym \\"Santoro\\". He was a major contributor to the cultural affairs bi-weekly, ' (The Illustrated Cripple, named by one of its founders, who had a bad leg), and a co-founder of El Granuja (The Rogue). In 1892, he was appointed Director of the government \\"Office of Buildings and Ornamentation\\" (Edificios y Ornato de Poblaciones) and, in 1908, became Director of the Art Academy, following the death of Emilio Jacinto Mauri. Early the following year, he was faced with a strike by a large group of students who were demanding changes in the curriculum. Two years later, together with Pedro Arismendi Brito (1832-1914), a former General and respected man of letters, he drafted regulations for the \\"Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes\\", which included music and acting as well as painting and sculpture. He also tendered his resignation, which was not accepted so, despite being the target of student protests, he retained the position until his death.

S. Platou and Otto Torgersen in 1957 Frithjof Stoud Platou (21 August 1903 ‚Äì 12 August 1980) was a Norwegian architect. He worked for the international architects Lars Backer and Erich Mendelsohn before he established his own architectural firm in Oslo. Among his most famous works are the Grand Hotel and the Kon-Tiki Museum, both in Oslo. Personal life Platou was born in Hamar to the banker Gabriel Andreas Stoud Platou (1858‚Äì1911) and his wife Ingeborg Sophie Falck (1864‚Äì1958). His only brother was Ragnar Stoud Platou, who later became a ship broker. Platou was nephew of Christian Emil and Waldemar Stoud Platou, and cousin of Karen Platou. In 1931, Platou married Aagot Jeanette Robsahm (1907‚Äì56), a daughter of wholesaler Andreas Robsahm (1878‚Äì1949) and his wife Aagot Manskow (1883‚Äì1970). Career In 1921, he took an examen artium in Hamar. He thereupon travelled to Switzerland where he studied architecture at Eidgen√∂ssische Technische Hochschule Z√ºrich from 1922 to 1926. He also studied economics in London in 1925. Lars Backer thereafter employed him as assistant in Oslo. In 1929‚Äì30, Platou was employed by Erich Mendelsohn. In 1930, Platou started his own architectural firm, which he named after himself. The Norwegian architects Otto Torgersen and Bernt Heiberg worked in his firm, which designed various functionalist buildings in Oslo. After the Second World War, the office was expanded with more architects, who designed many banking centers and enterprise buildings in Oslo. They also designed the Kon-Tiki Museum at Bygd√∏y and the headquarters of the Norwegian Association of Local and Regional Authorities at Vika in the Oslo city centre. After a fire in 1957, Platou designed a new building for the Grand Hotel in Oslo the following year. In 1971, his architectural firm was converted into a limited company. For many years, the firm performed major assignments abroad. Platou was co- founder of the engineering, architecture and design firm Norconsult, and headed the company from 1963 to 1968. He also had honoraries in some other architectural organisations in Norway. He died on 12 August 1980.

The dietary staples were bread, wine and olive oil, but also included legumes, fruits and vegetables, dairy products, fish and meat. Religious beliefs, which prohibited the consumption of certain foods, shaped the Israelite diet. There was considerable continuity in the main components of the diet over time, despite the introduction of new foodstuffs at various stages. The food of ancient Israel was similar to that of other ancient Mediterranean diets. Sources Information about the food of the ancient Israelites is based on written sources, archaeological records and comparative evidence from the wider region of the ancient Levant: The primary written source for the period is the Hebrew Bible, the largest collection of written documents surviving from ancient Israel. Other texts, such as the Dead Sea Scrolls, Apocryphal works, the New Testament, the Mishnah and the Talmud also provide information. Epigraphic sources include ostraca from Samaria and Arad. The Bible provides names of plants and animals that were used for food, such as the lists of permitted and forbidden animals (for example, and ), and the lists of foods brought to the king‚Äôs table (for example, ) or the foods that the Israelites are said to have longed for after leaving Egypt (). These lists indicate the potential foods that were available, but not necessarily how regularly the food was eaten or how significant it was in the cuisine, which needs to be derived from other sources. Archaeological remains include the items used for the production of food, such as wine or olive presses; stone and metal implements used in the preparation of food; and amphorae, jars, storerooms and grain pits used for storage. Animal bones provide evidence of meat consumption, the types of animals eaten, and whether they were kept for milk production or other uses, while paleobotanical remains, such as seeds or other carbonized or desiccated plant remains provide information about plant foods. Using both written and archaeological data, some comparisons can be drawn between the food of ancient Israel and its neighbors. Although there is much information about the foods of ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, the inferences that can be made are limited due to differences in topography and climate; Israelite agriculture also depended on rainfall rather than the river-based irrigation of these two civilizations, resulting in the preference for different crops. Ugarit and Phoenicia were closer neighbors of ancient Israel, and shared a topography and climate similar to that of ancient Israel. Thus, conclusions about the food and drink in ancient Israel have been made with some confidence from this evidence. History Significant milestones in the availability and development food production characteristic of Israelite cuisine occurred well before the Israelite period. On the other hand, vestiges of the cuisine and the practices associated with it continue to resonate in later Jewish cuisine and traditions that developed in Israel and Babylonia during the Talmudic period (200 CE ‚Äì 500 CE), and may still be discerned in the various culinary styles that have developed among Jewish communities since then. =Pre-Israelite= Wild species of barley and emmer wheat were domesticated and cultivated in the Jordan River Valley as early as the 9th millennium BCE. Archaeologists have found the carbonized seeds of two kinds of primitive wheat, einkorn and emmer, and two-rowed barley, in the earliest levels of digs at Jericho, one of the first cities in the world. During the Pottery Neolithic period (6000 ‚Äì 4300 BCE), the development of pottery enabled people to produce portable containers for the transportation and storage of food, and an economy based on agriculture and herding developed. Archaeological evidence indicates that figs, lentils and broad beans were being cultivated from Neolithic times. During the Chalcolithic period (4300 ‚Äì 3300 BCE), large pottery containers, indicative of settled peoples, appear in the archaeological record. Date palm cultivation began in the Jordan River Valley, and the earliest date pits have been discovered at Ein Gedi by the Dead Sea. In the Golan, olives trees were grown and olive oil was produced there. Chickpea cultivation dates back to the Bronze Age (3300 ‚Äì 1200 BCE) and grapes and olives became important crops in the hill country. Wine and oil were traded for wheat with the cities on the coastal plain, and for meat and skins with semi-nomadic herders. Wine and carobs were also exported to Egypt during this period. At Arad in the northern Negev, the remains of wheat, barley and legumes have been found, along with stone-lined storage pits for grain from this period. Pottery was imported from Cyprus and Mycenae in Greece for the first time, probably for use as good-quality tableware. After the Bronze Age collapse of urban culture, there was an increase in herding and the disappearance of smaller agricultural communities. =Israelite period= Granaries from an Iron Age Israelite fortress in the Negev, reconstructed at Derech Hadorot, Hecht Museum, Haifa. The Israelite presence emerged during the Early Iron Age (1200‚Äì1000 BCE), at first in the central hill country, Transjordan and the northern Negev, and later in the Galilee, while the Philistines and other Sea Peoples arrived at roughly the same time and settled in the coastal regions. Pastoralism and animal husbandry remained important, and walled open spaces in villages that probably served as paddocks have been discovered. The construction of terraces in the hills, and of additional plastered cisterns for water storage, enabled more cultivation than before. Storage pits and silos were dug into the ground to hold grain. Under the united Israelite monarchy, central store cities were built, and greater areas of the northern Negev came under cultivation. The Gezer agricultural calendar, detailing the crops that were raised, dates from this period. After the division of the Israelite kingdom, Jerusalem and a number of other cities expanded, supported by the surrounding villages and farms. These were called ‚Äúdaughters of‚Äù the major towns in the Hebrew Bible (for example, and ). Large food storage facilities and granaries were built, such as the city of Hazor. During the later Iron Age (Iron Age II) period, roughly the same period as the Israelite and Judean monarchies, olive oil and wine were produced on a large scale for commerce and export, as well as for local consumption. The ancient Israelites depended on bread, wine and oil as the basic dietary staples and this trio is often mentioned in the Bible (for example, and ) and in other texts, such as the Samaria and Arad ostraca. Written and archaeological evidence indicate that the diet also included other products from plants, trees and animals. Seven basic agricultural products, called the Seven Species, are listed in the Bible: wheat, barley, figs, grapes, olives, pomegranates, and dates (). The Bible also often describes the land of Israel as a land \\"flowing with milk and honey\\" (for example, ). The cuisine maintained many consistent traits based on the main products available from the early Israelite period until the Roman period, even though new foods became available during this extended time. For example, rice was introduced during the Persian era; during the Hellenistic period, as trade with the Nabateans increased, more spices became available, at least for those who could afford them, and more Mediterranean fish were imported into the cities; and during the Roman period, sugar cane was introduced. =Post-Second Temple era= The symbolic food of the ancient Israelites continued to be important among Jews after the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE or AD and the beginning of the Jewish Diaspora. Bread, wine, and olive oil were seen as direct links to the three main crops of ancient Israel ‚Äî wheat, grapes, and olives. In the Bible, this trio is described as representing the divine response to human needs () and particularly the need for the seasonal rains vital for the successful cultivation of these three crops. (). The significance of wine, bread and oil is indicated by their incorporation into Jewish religious ritual, with the blessings over wine and bread for Sabbath and holiday meals and at religious ceremonies such as weddings, and the lighting of Sabbath and festival lights with olive oil. Characteristics The daily diet of the ordinary ancient Israelite was mainly one of bread, cooked grains, and legumes. Bread was eaten with every meal. Vegetables played a smaller, but significant role in the diet. Legumes and vegetables were typically eaten in stews. The Israelites drank goat and sheep‚Äôs milk when it was available in the spring and summer, and ate butter, cheese, and honey. Figs and grapes were the fruits most commonly eaten, while dates, pomegranates, and other fruits and nuts were eaten more occasionally. Wine was the most popular beverage and sometimes other fermented beverages were produced. Meat, usually goat and mutton, was eaten rarely by most Israelites and was reserved for special occasions such as celebrations, festival meals, or sacrificial feasts. The wealthy ate meat more frequently. Olives were used primarily for their oil, which was used raw and to cook meat and stews. Game, birds, eggs, and fish were also eaten, depending on availability.http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20180508-israels-millennia-old- biblical-diethttp://www.asor.org/anetoday/2016/07/the-daily-stew-everyday- meals-in-ancient-israel/https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/eating-in- historical-jerusalem Most food was eaten fresh and in season. Fruits and vegetables had to be eaten as they ripened and before they spoiled. People had to contend with periodic episodes of hunger and famine; producing enough food required hard and well-timed labor, and the climatic conditions resulted in unpredictable harvests and the need to store as much food as possible. Thus, grapes were made into raisins and wine; olives were made into oil; figs, beans, and lentils were dried; and grains were stored for use throughout the year. An Israelite meal is illustrated by the biblical description of the rations that Abigail brought to David‚Äôs group: bread loaves, wine, butchered sheep, parched grain, raisins, and fig cakes ().The text also mentions five sheep, but ordinarily, meat was reserved for special occasions. Foods =Grains and bread= Durum wheat was the wheat most commonly grown in ancient Israel Grain products constituted the majority of the food consumed by the ancient Israelites. The staple food was bread, and it was such a vital part of each meal that the Hebrew word for bread, lehem, also referred to food in general. The supreme importance of bread to the ancient Israelites is also demonstrated by how Biblical Hebrew has at least a dozen words for bread, and bread features in numerous Hebrew proverbs (for example, , ). Bread was eaten at just about every meal and is estimated to have provided from 50 to 70 percent of an ordinary person‚Äôs daily calories. The bread eaten until the end of the Israelite monarchy was mainly made from barley flour; during the Second Temple period, bread from wheat flour become predominant. Porridge and gruel were made from ground grain, water, salt, and butter. This mixture also formed the basis for cakes, to which oil, called shemen, and fruits were sometimes added before baking. The Israelites cultivated both wheat and barley; these two grains are mentioned first in the biblical list of the Seven Species of the land of Israel and their importance as food is also seen in the celebration of the barley harvest at the festival of Shavuot and of the wheat harvest at the festival of Sukkot. Rice was introduced during the early Second Temple period through contact with the Persians. By the Roman period, rice had become an important export, and the Jerusalem Talmud states about rice that ‚Äúthere is none like it outside Israel,‚Äù and that notable rabbis served rice at the Passover seder. Barley Barley was the grain most commonly used to make into flour for bread in Iron Age Israel. Barley (hordeum vulgare) was the most important grain during the biblical period, and this was recognized ritually on the second day of Passover in the Omer offering, consisting of barley flour from the newly ripened crop. Furthermore, its significance to Israelite society, not only as a source of food, is illustrated by the biblical method for measuring a field by the amount of barley (rather than of wheat) with which it could be sown. Barley was initially predominant because it matured earlier and tolerated harsher conditions than wheat, growing in areas with less rainfall and poorer soils, such as northern Negev and the hill country. It had high yield potential and was resistant to insect infestation. It could be sown without plowing and could therefore be grown on small plots of land that oxen or even donkeys could not reach, and it did not need artificial irrigation. It ripened a month earlier than wheat and was thus available to replenish supplies used up during the winter sooner than wheat, and also provide some food security if the more vulnerable wheat crop was poor or failed. Two varieties of barley were cultivated: two-rowed, and six-rowed. Two-rowed barley was the older, hulled form; six-rowed barley was unhulled and easier to thresh, and, since the kernels remained intact, store for longer periods. Hulled barley was thus the prevalent type during the Iron Age, but gruels made from it must have had a gritty taste due to the barley‚Äôs tough outer layers. Bread was primarily made from barley flour during the Iron Age (, ), as barley was more widely and easily grown, and was thus more available, cheaper, and could be made into bread without a leavening agent even though wheat flour was regarded as superior. It was presumably made from dough that was a simple mixture of barley flour and water, divided into small pieces, formed by hand into round shapes, then baked. However, barley declined as the staple from the biblical period to a poverty food by the end of the Second Temple period, and by the Talmudic era, it was regarded mostly as animal fodder. Wheat Emmer wheat (triticum dicoccum) was initially the most widespread variety of wheat, as it grew well in the warm climate and was resistant to fungal rot. It was high yielding, with large grains and relatively high amounts of gluten, and bread made from emmer wheat flour was thus fairly light in texture. However, emmer required time-consuming pounding or roasting to remove its husk, and during the Iron Age, durum wheat (triticum durum), a descendant of emmer, gradually replaced emmer and became the favored grain for making fine flour. Durum grew well in the rich soil of the larger valleys of the central and northern areas of the country, where rainfall exceeded 225 millimeters per year, was higher yielding than emmer, and its grains released more easily from the chaff. It could therefore be separated from the husk without roasting or pounding first, thus reducing the work required for threshing, and also leaving most of the grains whole, which was better for longer storage. However, durum is a hard grain and was difficult to grind with the early hand-held grindstones. The flour also had to be sifted repeatedly to obtain fine flour (such as the solet required in the Temple offerings). Thus, durum was primarily used for porridges, or parboiled and dried, or roasted and boiled, and barley flour continued to be used for making bread until another hybrid of emmer, common or ‚Äúbread‚Äù wheat (triticum aestivum) replaced barley as the primary grain after the Greek conquest of the land of Israel; this together with durum wheat, became widespread during the Greco-Roman period, constituting the bulk of the grain crop by the end of the Second Temple period. The introduction of common wheat, which contained more starch and had a higher level of gluten, spread the use of wheat for bread- making and led to the production of loaves that were more lightly textured than barley and durum wheat breads. Preparation of grains A series of developments in technology for threshing, milling, and baking improved both the quantity and the quality of the grain and the means for preparation that were available from the beginning of the Iron Age until the end of the Second Temple period. In the early Iron Age, grain was threshed to remove it from the stalks by beating it with sticks or by oxen treading on it. This usually broke most of the grain kernels, which limited their storage time because broken kernels spoil more quickly than unbroken ones. The development of the threshing-board, which was pulled over the stalks by oxen, left most of the grain kernels intact and enhanced their storage time. Numerous threshing floors and threshing boards have been discovered at archaeological sites of ancient Israel. Once separated from the stalks, the grain was used in a number of ways: Most simply, unripe kernels of grain were eaten fresh, particularly in the spring, before ripe grain was available, and both unripe and ripe grain was roasted over fire for immediate use. Ripe grains of wheat were also parboiled and dried, like modern bulgur, and then prepared as porridge. Whole or cracked grain was also used in stews and to make gruel. Most frequently, grains were ground into flour to prepare bread. Bread making Bread was the main source of nourishment in biblical times, and making bread was a daily activity: An upper hand stone was used to grind grain on the lower quern stone. Bread-making began with the milling of the grain. It was a difficult and time-consuming task performed by women. Each household stored its own grain, and it is estimated that it required at least three hours of daily effort to produce enough flour to make sufficient bread for a family of five. The earliest milling was performed with a pestle and mortar, or a stone quern consisting of a large lower stone that held the grain and a smooth upper stone that was moved back and forth over the grains (). This often left small pieces of grit in the flour. The use of the millstone became more widespread during the Iron Age, resulting in greater speed and increased production of flour. Smaller versions for household use, the rotary or beehive quern, appeared during the early Persian period. After the grain was milled into flour, it was mixed with water and kneaded in a large trough. For dough made with wheat flour, starter, called seor, was added. The starter was prepared by reserving a small portion of dough from a previous batch to absorb the yeasts in the air and thus help leaven the new dough. Seor thus gave the bread a sourdough flavor. Once prepared, the dough could be baked in various ways: Initially, the dough was placed directly on the heated stones of a cooking fire or in a griddle or pan made of clay or iron (). In the time of the First Temple, two types of oven were used for baking bread: the jar-oven, and the pit-oven. The jar-oven was a large pottery container, narrowing into an opening toward the top; fuel was burned on the inside to heat it and the dough was pressed against the outside to bake. The pit-oven was a clay-lined excavation in the ground in which the fuel was burned and then pushed aside before the loaves were baked on the heated surface. People also began placing a convex dome, initially earthenware and later metal, over the pit-oven and cooking the flatbreads on the dome instead of on the ash-covered surface; this type of oven is probably what was meant by the biblical machabat, often translated as ‚Äúgriddle‚Äù. The Persians introduced a clay oven called a tanur (similar to the Indian tandoor), which had an opening at the bottom for the fire, and through which the bread was placed to be baked on the inner wall of the upper chamber from the heat of the oven and ashes after the flames had died down. This continued to be the way in which Yemenite Jews baked bread until modern times. The remains of clay ovens and fragments of bread trays have been found in several archaeological excavations. All these methods produced only thin loaves, and the custom was thus to break bread rather than cut it. The bread was soft and pliable and used for dipping and sopping up gravies and juices. The Romans introduced an oven called a \\"furn\\" (\\"purni\\" in Talmudic Aramaic): a large, wood-burning, stone-lined oven with a bottom on which the dough or baking sheet was placed. This provided a major advance in bread and pastry baking, and made the baking of much thicker loaves possible. A variety of breads were produced. Probably most common were unleavened flat loaves called ugah or kikkar. Another type was a thin wafer, known as a rakik. A thicker loaf, known as hallah, was made with the best-quality flour, usually for ritual purposes. Bread was sometimes enriched by the addition of flour from legumes (). The Mishna (Hallah 2:2) mentions bread dough made with fruit juice instead of water. The sugar in the juice, interacting with the flour and water, provided some leavening and sweetened the bread. The Israelites also sometimes added fennel and cumin to bread dough for flavor and dipped their bread in vinegar, () olive oil, or sesame oil for extra flavor. =Legumes= After grain, legumes such as lentils, broad or fava beans, chickpeas, and peas were the main element in the diet and were the main source of protein, since meat was rarely eaten. Broad beans, chickpeas, and lentils are the only legumes mentioned in the Bible but lentils, broad beans, chickpeas, fenugreek, field peas and bitter vetch have been found at Iron Age Israelite sites. By the Roman period, legumes are mentioned frequently in other texts. They are cited as one of the elements of the ‚Äúwife‚Äôs food basket‚Äù in the Mishna (Ketubot 5:8), by which it is estimated that legumes supplied 17% of daily calories at that time. Lentils were the most important of the legumes and were used to make pottages and soups, as well as fried lentil cakes called ashishim (similar to Arabic felafel), such as those that King David is described as distributing to the people when the Ark of the Covenant was brought to Jerusalem.According to Tova Dickstein, a researcher at Neot Kedumim in Israel, ashishim were honey-dipped pancakes made from crushed red lentils and sesame seeds.Biblical cuisine inspires Bible learning in Israel Stews made of lentils or beans were common and they were cooked with onion, garlic, and leeks for flavor. Fresh legumes were also roasted, or dried and stored for extended periods. They were then cooked in a soup or a stew. The Bible mentions roasted legumes (), and relates how Jacob prepared bread and a pottage of lentils for Esau (). =Vegetables= Vegetables are not found often in the archaeological record, and it is difficult to determine the role that they played, because plant foods were often eaten raw or were simply boiled, without requiring special equipment for preparation, and thus barely leaving any trace other than the type of food itself. Vegetables also are not mentioned often in the written record, and when the Bible does mention them, the attitude is mixed: sometimes they are regarded as a delicacy, but more often, they were held in low esteem (for example, (, ). Vegetables were perhaps a more important food at the extremes in society: the wealthy who could afford to dedicate land and resources to grow them, and the poor who depended on gathering them in the wild to supplement their meager supplies. More people may have gathered wild plants during famine conditions. Vegetables that were commonly eaten included leeks, garlic, onions, black radishes, net or muskmelons (sometimes misidentified as the cucumber) and watermelons. Other vegetables played a minor role in the diet of the ancient Israelites. Field greens and root plants were generally not cultivated and were gathered seasonally when they grew in the wild. Leafy plants included dandelion greens and the young leaves of the orach plant. Leeks, onions, and garlic were eaten cooked in stews, and uncooked with bread, and their popularity may be indicated by the observation in the Bible that they are among the foods that the Israelites yearned for after leaving Egypt. Gourds and melons were eaten raw or flavored with vinegar. Black radishes were also eaten raw when in season during the autumn and winter. The Talmud mentions the use of radish seeds to produce oil and considered eating radishes to have health benefits. Wild lettuce, or \\"chazeret\\", was eaten as a bitter herb at the Passover meal Wild herbs were collected and eaten uncooked or cooked. These are known to have included garden rocket and mallow, and both leaf chicory and endive. Wild lettuce, known as chazeret, was a leafy herb with prickly, red tinged leaves that became bitter as they matured. It was cultivated from around 800 BC. Sweeter head-lettuce was only developed and introduced by the Romans. Bitter herbs eaten at the Passover sacrifice with the unleavened bread, matza, were known as merorim. \\"Chazeret\\" is listed in the Mishna (Pesahim 2:6) as the preferred bitter herb for this Passover ritual, along with other bitter herbs, including chicory or endive (ulshin), horehound (tamcha), reichardia or eryngo (charchavina), and wormwood (maror). Mushrooms, especially of the Boletus type, were gathered in many areas, particularly when plentiful after a major rainfall. The Talmud mentions mushrooms in connection with their exemption from tithes and as a dessert at the Passover seder. Sesame seeds were used in the preparation of oil, were eaten dry, or were added to dishes such as stews as a flavoring; the leftovers after pressing out the oil were eaten in a cake form. The Hebrew for sesame, shumshum, is related to the Akkadian samassammu, meaning ‚Äúoil plant‚Äù, as the seeds contain about 50% oil, which was pressed from the seeds. Sesame is not mentioned in the Bible, but the Mishna lists sesame oil as suitable for lighting the Sabbath lights, and the oil was also used for frying. =Fruit= Fruit was an important source of food for the Israelites, particularly grapes, olives, and figs. Grapes were grown mostly for wine, although some were eaten fresh at harvest time, or dried as raisins for storage, while olives were grown exclusively for their oil, until the Roman period. Other fruits that were eaten were the date, pomegranate, and sycamore fig. The ancient Israelites built terraces of leveled areas in the hill country for planting a variety of crops, including grains, vegetables, and fruit trees. All the trees, with the exception of the olive, produced fruit that could be eaten fresh or juiced while in season. Fruit was also processed for later use in a variety of ways: fruit with high sugar content was fermented to make alcoholic beverages; grapes were most commonly used for this. Fruit was also boiled down into thick, sweet syrup, referred to in the Bible as dvash (honey). Grapes, figs, dates, and apricots were also dried and preserved individually, put on a string, or pressed into cakes. Since dried fruit is an efficient source of energy, such were prepared as provisions for journeys and long marches. Olives and olive oil The olive is one of the biblical Seven Species and one of the three elements of the ‚ÄúMediterranean triad‚Äù in Israelite cuisine. Olive oil was used not only as food and for cooking, but also for lighting, sacrificial offerings, ointment, and anointment for priestly or royal office. Olives were one of ancient Israel‚Äôs most important natural resources The olive tree was well suited to the climate and soil of the Israelite highlands, and a significant part of the hill country was allocated to the cultivation of olive trees, which were one of ancient Israel‚Äôs most important natural resources. Olive oil was more versatile and longer-lasting than the oil from other plants, such as sesame, and was also considered to be the best-tasting. Although olives were used to produce oil from the Bronze Age, it was only by the Roman period that the techniques were introduced to cure olives in lye and then brine to remove their natural bitterness and make them edible. Olives were harvested in the late summer and were processed for oil by crushing them, pressing the mash, and separating the oil from the flesh. In the early Iron Age period, this was done by treading the olives in basins cut into rock, or with a mortar or stone on a flat slab. In the later Iron Age period, the introduction of the beam press made large scale processing possible. The discovery of many ancient olive presses in various locations indicates that olive oil production was highly developed in ancient Israel. The oil production center dating from the 7th century BC discovered at Ekron, a Philistine city, has over one hundred large olive presses and is the most complete olive oil production center from ancient times yet discovered. It indicates that ancient Israel was a major producer of olive oil for its residents and other parts of the ancient Near East, such as Egypt, and especially Mesopotamia. In addition to the large- scale olive oil production for commerce and export, presses have been found in ordinary houses, indicating that this was also a cottage industry. Archaeological remains at Masada and other sites indicate that the most common olive cultivar was the indigenous Nabali, followed by the Souri. In Roman times, other olive cultivars were imported from Syria and Egypt. There is also some written information about olive oil. The Bible describes its use in relation to certain sacrifices in which olive oil is used (for example, (, ). However, these sacrificial ‚Äúrecipes‚Äù can be assumed to represent some of the everyday uses of oil and methods for cooking and frying. Olive oil was mixed with flour to make bread in the story of Elijah and the widow of Zarephath () and is also noted as a valuable product for eating (). Olive oil is also mentioned on the Samaria and Arad ostraca. The consumption of olive oil varied with social class: it was less available to the poor, but it may have become more available later in the Israelite period as the means of production improved and became more widespread. By early Roman times, the Mishna indicates that it was one of the four essential foods that a husband had to provide his wife, and it has been calculated that at a minimum, this represented about 11 percent of the overall calories supplied by the ‚Äúfood basket‚Äù described at that time. Grapes Grapes are another of the biblical Seven Species and were used mainly for the production of wine, although they were also eaten fresh and dried. Grapes were dried in the sun to produce raisins, which could then be stored for a long time. Raisins were also pressed into clusters and dried as cakes, which kept the interior raisins softer. Grapes were also used to produce a thick, honey-like liquid, called grape honey (dvash anavim), that was used as a sweetener. Grape honey was made by treading the grapes in vats, but instead of fermenting the liquid produced, it was boiled to evaporate its water, leaving behind the thick, grape syrup.  Figs  figs were a significant source of winter food Figs were an important source of food. Figs were cultivated throughout the land of Israel, and fresh or dried figs were part of the daily diet. A common way of preparing dried figs was to chop them and press them into a cake. Figs are one of the biblical Seven Species and are frequently mentioned in the Bible (for example, , and ). The remains of dried figs have been discovered from as early as the Neolithic period in Gezer, Israel and Gilgal in the Jordan Valley. The fig tree (ficus carica) grew well in the hill country and produced two crops a season. Early-ripening figs were regarded as delicacy because of their sweetness and were eaten fresh. Figs ripening in the later harvest were often dried and strung into a chain, or pressed into hard round or square-shaped cakes called develah and stored as a major source of winter food. The blocks of dried fig were sliced and eaten like bread. The Mishna mentions figs as one the components of the prescribed ‚Äúwife‚Äôs food basket‚Äù and they are estimated to have constituted 16% of the overall calories of the basket.  Dates  Dates were eaten fresh or dried, but were mostly boiled into thick, long- lasting syrup called ‚Äúdate honey‚Äù (dvash temarim) for use as a sweetener. This syrup was prepared by soaking the dates in water for some time until they disintegrated and then boiling the resulting liquid down into thick syrup. The honey in the Biblical reference of ‚Äúa land flowing with milk and honey‚Äù is probably date honey. Fresh, ripe dates were available from the mid- to late- summer. Some were sun-dried and pressed into blocks to dry completely and then used throughout the year, especially as food for travelers. Dates were also fermented into one of the ‚Äústrong drinks‚Äù referred to in the Bible as ‚Äúshechar‚Äù. The date palm required a hot and dry climate and mostly grew and produced fruit in the Jordan Rift Valley from Jericho to the Sea of Galilee. In these arid areas, the date was sometimes the only plant-food available and was a primary component of the diet, but it was less important elsewhere.  Pomegranates  Silver half shekel coins minted during the First Jewish‚ÄìRoman War show three pomegranates on the reverse. Pomegranates were usually eaten fresh, although occasionally they were used to make juice or wine, or sun-dried for use when the fresh fruit was out of season. They probably played a minor part in Israelite cuisine but were symbolically important as adornments on the hem of the robe of the high priest and the Temple pillars and embossed on coinage; they are also listed in the Bible as one of the Seven Species of the Land of Israel. Other fruits and nuts The sycamore fig, carob, mulberry, and possibly the apple were also eaten. Usually, these fruits were not cultivated but were picked in the wild when they were in season. The sycamore fig (ficus sycamorus) was very common in the warmer parts of Israel and was grown primarily for its wood, but it provided a steady supply of small figs, eaten mainly by the poor. Other native trees producing fruits included the carob, which was probably popular due to its sweet taste, and the black mulberry. The tapuah, which means ‚Äúapple‚Äù in modern Hebrew, is mentioned in the Bible, but it is not clear if this referred to another fruit, such as the quince. Almonds, walnuts, and pistachios were eaten and are mentioned in the Bible. Almonds were widespread in the region from prehistoric times, and the Bible mentions almonds (shaked) and pistachios (botnim) as among the ‚Äúchoice fruits of the land‚Äù sent by Jacob as a gift to the ruler of Egypt (). Almonds and pistachios were probably eaten primarily by the wealthy. The walnut reached Israel from Mesopotamia by at least 2000 BCE and is mentioned once in the Bible (). Walnuts became common during the Second Temple period and so widespread that the word for walnut, egoz, became the generic Hebrew word for nut at that time. =Wine and other drinks= The Israelites usually drank water drawn from wells, cisterns, or rivers. They also drank milk (for example, as mentioned in the Bible in ), often in the form of sour milk, thin yogurt, or whey, when it was available in the spring and summer. They drank fresh juices from fruits in season as well. The most strongly preferred beverage was wine, although some beer may have also been produced, and wine was an important part of the diet and a source of calories, sugar, and iron. Making wine was also a practical way to preserve fruit juices for long-term storage. Usually, wine was made from grapes for everyday use, as well as for rituals, such as sacrificial libations. Less often, wine was made from pomegranates and dates. Wine The Mediterranean climate and soil of the mountainous areas of the area are well suited to viticulture, and both archaeological evidence and written records indicate the significant cultivation of grapes in ancient Israel and the popularity of wine-drinking. The production capacity apparent from archaeological remains and the frequent biblical references to wine suggest that it was the principal alcoholic beverage of the ancient Israelites. Based on the remains of wine production facilities and storage rooms, it has been estimated that on average, people could have consumed one liter of wine per person per day. Ancient Israelite wine press at Migdal HaEmek. Many rock-hewn winepresses and vats, dating to the biblical period, have been found. One typical example at Gibeon has a wide surface for treading the grapes and a series of collecting vats. Archaeological finds at Ashkelon and Gibeon indicate large-scale wine production in the 8th and 7th centuries BC, which most likely developed to supply the Assyrian empire, and then the Babylonians, as well as the local population. Vineyards are mentioned many times in the Bible, including in detailed descriptions of the method for establishing a vineyard () and the types of vines (). The Bible refers to several types of wine, and one of the Arad ostraca also mentions wine among the supplies being sent to a garrison of soldiers. Another indication of the importance of wine in ancient Israel is that Hebrew contains numerous terms for various stages and types of vines, grape varieties, and words for wine. The word yayin was used both as a generic word for wine and as a term for wine in its first year, once it had undergone sufficient fermentation from the initial stage, when it was called tirosh. The type of wine was determined by the grapes, the time allowed for fermentation, and the age of the wine. The often coarse and unrefined taste of ancient wine was adjusted to make it more drinkable. Spices were added directly to the wine to improve the aroma, and other ingredients, such as honey, pepper, herbs, and even lime, resin, or seawater were added to improve the flavor or disguise a poor-tasting wine. Wine was also sweetened by the addition of grape juice syrup. Wine was also sometimes given an aroma by rubbing the winepress with wood resin. Wine could also be added to drinking water to improve the taste, especially towards the end of the summer when rainwater had been standing in a cistern for at least six months. This also had the beneficial effect of lowering the bacterial content of the water. Grapes were important for the production of wine in ancient Israel After the grape harvest in mid-summer, most grapes were taken to wine presses to extract their juice for winemaking. Once fermented, wine was transferred to wineskins or large amphorae for storage. Israelite amphorae were typically tall with large handles and little decoration, and the handles were often inscribed with the name of the city in which the wine had been produced, the winemaker‚Äôs stamp, and sometimes the year and the vintage. Amphorae made long term storage possible, especially in caves or cool cellars. Glass bottles were introduced only in the 1st century AD by the Romans. The insides of amphorae were often coated with a preservative resin, such as from the terebinth, and this imparted a pine flavor and aroma to the wine. Before the jars were sealed with pitch, they were filled completely and often topped with a thin layer of olive oil to prevent spoilage due to exposure to air. During the Greek period, the style of winemaking changed. Ripe grapes were first dried to concentrate the sugars, and these then produced a much sweeter and higher alcohol content wine that needed to be diluted with water to be drinkable. Before this, watered-down wine was disparaged, but by the time of the Talmud, wine that did not require dilution with water was considered unfit for consumption. Beer Beer, produced by brewing barley, was another alcoholic beverage common in the ancient Near East. Beer was the primary beverage of ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia and it can be assumed that in Israel, which is located between the two, beer was also known. The biblical term sekhar may refer to beer or to alcoholic drinks in general. The production of bread and beer were closely linked, since barley was the same key ingredient used for both, and most of the tools used in beer production, such as mortars, querns and winnowing baskets were also the same as for bread making. Archaeological evidence specific to beer making is thus uncommon, and earlier indications were that the ancient Israelites did not often drink beer. More recently, Iron Age sites in Israel have produced remains such as beer jugs, bottles, strainers and stoppers, all of which provide evidence that the Israelites drank beer. Nonetheless, the widespread cultivation of grapes, used primarily for winemaking, indicates that wine drinking was probably far more common than beer drinking. =Meat= The Israelites usually ate meat from domesticated goats and sheep. Goat‚Äôs meat was the most common. Fat-tailed sheep were the predominant variety of sheep in ancient Israel, but, as sheep were valued more than goats, they were eaten less often. The fat of the tail was considered a delicacy. Beef and venison were eaten primarily by the elites, and fattened calves provided veal for the wealthy (for example, as mentioned in the Bible, ). For most people, meat was eaten only a few times a year when animals were slaughtered for the major festivals, or at tribal meetings, celebrations such as weddings, and for the visits of important guests (). Only at the king's table was meat served daily, according to the Bible. Although most meat was obtained from domesticated animals, meat from hunted animals was also sometimes available, as the story of Isaac and Esau (), certain Biblical lists (for example, ), and archaeological evidence indicate. The remains of gazelle, red deer, and fallow deer are the most commonly found in the archaeological record. Archaeological evidence from an Iron Age market excavated at Ashkelon shows that game was also sold to those who could not hunt or trap them themselves. However, meat from wild animals was more common at times of economic distress and in the northern areas, where forests and open land provided a habitat for more wild animals. Meat was prepared in several different ways. The most common was to cook it with water as a broth or a stew (for example, ). Meat stewed with onions, garlic, and leeks and flavored with cumin and coriander is described on ancient Babylonian cuneiform tablets, and it is most likely that it was prepared similarly in ancient Israel. Stewed meat was considered to be a dish worthy of serving to honored guests (). A less common way to prepare meat was to roast it over an open fire, but this was done particularly for the meat of the Passover lamb. For long-term storage, meat was smoked, dried, or salted, according to indications in texts and ethnographic studies. =Poultry and eggs= The Israelites ate domesticated birds such as pigeons, turtledoves, ducks, and geese, and wild birds such as quail, and partridge. Remains from archaeological excavations at the Ophel in Jerusalem and other Iron Age sites show that domestic birds were available, but consumption was small. The inclusion of pigeons and turtledoves in the Biblical sacrifice lists implies that they were raised domestically, and the remains of dovecotes discovered from the Greek and Roman periods confirm this. Biblical references and archaeological evidence also demonstrate that wild birds were hunted and eaten. The turtledove was present from about April to October, while the rock pigeon was available throughout the year. The pigeon appears to have been domesticated in Sumeria and Canaan during the second millennium BC, and remained the predominant fowl in ancient Israel until the end of the Second Temple period. Nonetheless, to avoid the spread of disease, pigeons could only be raised in small numbers and were thus fairly costly and not a regular part of the diet. Geese, originally domesticated in ancient Egypt, were raised in ancient Israel. They are most likely the ‚Äúfattened fowl‚Äù on King Solomon‚Äôs table (). Goose breeding is also discussed in the Mishna. Like other animals, birds were fattened for consumption on special occasions, and for the wealthy. It is unclear when chicken became part of the diet. There are some archaeological remains from Iron Age sites, but these were likely from roosters as a fighting bird, which are also pictured on seals from the period as a symbol of ferocity, such as on the 6th century BC onyx seal of Jaazaniah. Chicken became common around the 2nd century BC, and during the Roman period, chickens emerged as an important feature of the cuisine, with the Talmud describing it as ‚Äúthe choicest of birds.‚Äù By Roman times, pigeons and chickens were the principal poultry. Until the domestication of the chicken, eggs were available in limited quantities and were considered a delicacy, as in ancient Egypt. The most common birds ‚Äì turtledoves and pigeons ‚Äì were reared for their meat and not for their very small eggs. Biblical references to eggs are only in reference to gathering them from the wild (for example, and ). Eggs seem to have increased in use for food only with the introduction of chickens as food and were commonly used as food by Roman times. =Fish= The Israelites ate a variety of fresh and saltwater fish, according to both archaeological and textual evidence. Remains of freshwater fish from the Yarkon and Jordan rivers and the Sea of Galilee have been found in excavations, and include St. Peter‚Äôs fish and mouthbreeders. Saltwater fish discovered in excavations include sea bream, grouper, meager, and gray mullet. Most of these come from the Mediterranean Sea, but in the later Iron Age period, some are from the Red Sea. Fishermen supplied fish to inland communities, as remains of fish, including bones and scales, have been discovered at many inland sites. To preserve them for transport, the fish were first smoked or dried and salted. Merchants also imported fish, sometimes from as far as from Egypt, where pickled roe was an export article. Remains of Nile Perch from Egypt have been found, and these must have been smoked or dried before being imported through the trade network that connected ancient Near Eastern societies. Merchants shipped fish to Jerusalem, and there was evidently a significant trade in fish; one of the gates of Jerusalem was called the Fish Gate, named for a fish market nearby (, , , , ). It is unclear to what extent fish played a role in the cuisine, but it is apparent that fish became steadily more available during the Israelite and Judean monarchies. Fish products were salted and dried and sent great distances. However, even in the later Persian, Greek, and Roman periods, the cost of preserving and transporting fish must have meant that only wealthier inhabitants of the highland towns and cities could afford it, or those who lived close to the sources, where it was less expensive. In the Galilee, small-scale fishing was a fundamental component of the agrarian economy. =Dairy foods= Goats, and, to a lesser extent, sheep, provided milk for part of the year, and milk and dairy products were a significant source of food. Dairy products are mentioned in the Bible (for example, , , and , and a repeated description of the Land of Israel in the Bible is ‚Äúa land flowing with milk and honey‚Äù (for example, , , and )). Fresh milk could not be stored for long without spoiling. Typically, thick sour milk called laban was drunk because the Israelites stored the milk in skin containers, in which it curdled quickly.DailyLife, pg. 68: However, the meal that Abraham is described as serving to his guests (Gen 18:8) shows that fresh milk was an important part of a sumptuous meal. Fresh milk was also a thirst-quenching drink, as described in the story of Yael and Sisera (Judges 4:19). Milk had to be processed to preserve it. This was done by first churning it, using a goatskin or clay container to separate the butterfat from the whey. The butterfat was processed by boiling and then cooling it to make clarified butter, which could then be stored for a long time. Clarified butter was used principally for cooking and frying. Butter churns have been excavated at Beersheba, dating from the 4th century BC, and other ancient Israelite sites. Goat milk and sheep‚Äôs milk cheeses were the most prevalent types of cheese. Soft cheese was made using cloth bags filled with soured milk. The thin liquid was drained through the cloth until a soft cheese remained in the bag. A hard cheese was made from fermented soured milk: Milk was poured into special moulds in which it curdled and was then hardened by drying in the sun or by heating numerous, small, cheese molds with holes for draining the whey. Cheese is not mentioned often in the Bible, but in one case, David is sent to take a gift of cheese to the commander of the army (). The Mishna and Talmud mention using the sap of fruit trees, such as figs, to harden cheese (a method still used by nomadic herders of the region until modern times). Using fig sap instead of animal enzymes to make cheese also conformed to the prohibition on mixing meat and milk. =Honey= Fruit syrup called ‚Äúdvash‚Äù served as the primary sweetener and was most often made from dates. It was not until Talmudic times that the word ‚Äúdvash‚Äù, now translated as ‚Äúhoney‚Äù, generally meant bee honey. The Biblical term ‚Äúdvash‚Äù usually did not mean bee honey, but thick syrup obtained from grapes, figs, or dates. This syrup was similar to the date syrup, or ‚Äúhalek‚Äù, that many Jews continue to use in modern times.Roden pg. 627 The Biblical references to ‚Äúhoney from the crag‚Äù () or ‚Äúhoney from the rock‚Äù () could refer either to fig honey, as fig trees commonly grew in rocky outcrops, or to honey collected from wild bees, which made their nests in these places, as they still do in the region until today. The Bible refers to honey from bees in only a few instances, for example, when Samson eats honey from bees made in the carcass of a lion () and when Jonathan eats honey from a honeycomb (), and these references are to honey obtained from the wild. Nonetheless, the oldest archaeological find relating to beekeeping discovered to date is an apiary dating from about 900 BC at Rehov, a Bronze Age and Iron Age site in the Jordan Valley. The hives, made of straw and unbaked clay, could have housed more than a million bees, and indicate that honey was produced on a large scale. It is most likely that the inhabitants of Tel Rehov imported the bees from Anatolia, because they were less aggressive than the local bees and produced a higher yield of honey. It is also possible that the domestication of bees for honey production was introduced from Egypt during the Iron Age, and honey was being obtained from domesticated bees from late in the Iron Age period. =Seasonings= Hyssop, called ezov, was used as a seasoning. The most common and important seasoning was salt (), demonstrated by how it is referenced throughout the Bible, and by how its use was mandated with most sacrifices (). Salt was obtained from the Mediterranean or the Dead Sea. It was produced by evaporating seawater from both natural and artificially created drying pans along the Mediterranean coast. It was also obtained by mining salt deposits, such as at Sodom near the Dead Sea. Salt had to be transported to other locations, so most communities had to purchase it. Food was also flavored by plants, most native to the region and either cultivated, or gathered in the wild, although a few spices were imported. Garlic, onions, and possibly fenugreek were used to season cooked foods, as well as being eaten as vegetables. Herbs and spices included capers, coriander, cumin, black cumin, dill, dwarf chicory, hyssop, marjoram, mint, black mustard, reichardia, saffron, and thyme. Some seasonings were imported, such as myrrh, galbanum, saffron, and cinnamon, but their high cost limited their widespread use. Spices for special feasts were imported by the wealthy and royalty from Arabia and India and were highly valued. These included various types of pepper, and ginger. Another seasoning was vinegar, which was produced by extra fermentation of new wine. It was used for seasoning foods, pickling vegetables, and medicinal purposes. Storage and preparation of food Storing water and food was critical for survival, and particularly, being able to store enough food for use from one harvest to the next. To protect grain from damp and vermin, underground granaries were used for the bulk storage of grain. Families also stored grain, wine and oil in large pottery jars in their houses. When well protected, wheat, barley, legumes and nuts could be kept for long periods. Rainwater from roofs and courtyards was collected in cisterns to supplement natural sources like springs and wells. Storage jars from Iron Age Megiddo. Fermentation, oil extraction and drying were all ways of converting food into products that could be stored. Feeding crops to animals was also a means of \\"storage on the hoof\\" with the animals converting the fodder into meat or milk. Food was cooked in pots made of clay and placed on earthenware stands built in a horseshoe shape, so that the fire could be lit through the opening, under the pot, or pots were suspended above the fire from tripods. Cooked food included soups and stews that were a mixture of meat and vegetables. Beans and lentils were likely to have been cooked several times a week. However, vegetables, such as melons, garlic, leek and onions were also eaten uncooked. Meals Meals eaten by the Israelites fell into two categories: daily meals, and festive or ritual meals. =Daily meals= Pottery serving jugs from Iron Age Megiddo. Daily meals were prepared by women. Two daily meals were usually eaten by the family, either in the home or in the field. The first meal was eaten in the late-morning, as a break in the workday, and could include roasted grain, olives, figs or some other fruit, bread dipped in olive oil or vinegar, or bread eaten with garlic, onions, or black radishes for flavor, and water or wine. A description in the Book of Ruth provides an example of this kind of meal: the harvest workers eat bread, dipped in vinegar, and parched or roasted grain (). Agricultural workers, who comprised the largest part of the population, also ate a light meal in the early morning before leaving for their work in the fields (). The second meal was the main meal of the day and was eaten in the evening. In addition to bread, it typically included soup or a stew of vegetables or legumes, served in a common pot into which everyone dipped their bread. Also served from time to time were cheese and fruits such as fresh figs and melon when in season, as well as dried fruits. Water, wine, and milk could also accompany the meal. Small bowls were used for both eating and drinking. Small jugs contained condiments like olive oil, vinegar, and sweeteners. Wide-mouthed pitchers held water and milk, while spouted decanters with narrow, ridged necks with built- in strainers held wine. =Festive meals and feasts= Festive meals were held to mark significant occasions, entertain important guests, or as sacrificial or ritual meals. The meal was prepared by both men and women. Meat was always served at these meals and many people participated so that there would be no leftovers that would go to waste. Ritual feasts and banquets in ancient Israel, and the ancient Near East in general, were important for building social relationships and demonstrating status, transacting business and concluding agreements, enlisting divine help, or showing thanks, devotion or propitiation to a deity, and for conveying social instruction. These meals were imbued with significance by the occasion and were a time for entertainment and enjoyment. Israelite house. Festive meals were held only from time to time, but they are the ones recorded by biblical and extra- biblical sources. Many biblical stories are set within the context of a meal, such as the accounts of the food Abraham prepares for his visitors (), the stew which Jacob prepares for his father, Isaac, and the Passover meal (). In the story of Abraham hosting the three visitors, Abraham offers cakes, a well prepared young calf, curds, and milk. This meal has similar elements to an earlier meal described in the story of Sinuhe, an Egyptian nobleman who lived for a time in Canaan around 1900 BCE, at which bread, wine, cooked meat, roast fowl, and dairy products were served. One of the distinguishing features of the meals of the wealthier social class, as illustrated in the stories of Abraham and Sinuhe, was the more frequent consumption of meat. A description of the provisions for Solomon's kitchen also illustrates this: \\"Solomon's daily provisions consisted of 30 kor of fine flour and 60 kor of flour, 10 fat oxen, 20 pasture-fed oxen, and 100 sheep and goats, in addition to deer and gazelles, roebucks and fattened geese\\" (). This account describes the provisions that were possible to obtain for those with the resources to purchase them and indicates they were sufficient to provide sumptuous meals for thousands of people. Another example of a lavish meal celebrating an important occasion is the inauguration of the Temple by Solomon (, ). Similar meals are described regarding Hezekiah's temple consecration () and Passover celebration (). In contrast to the simplicity of the daily fare of ordinary people, the cuisine of the royal courts of the ancient Near East was sophisticated, and it is assumed that the dishes served at the table of King Solomon and other Israelite kings were also elaborate. King David had officials who were in charge of wine cellars, olive stores, cattle, olive and fig trees () and the royal kitchen was a complex organization. The kings of Israel are recorded as having displayed an extraordinary measure of royal hospitality, like other kings of the ancient Near East who held elaborate banquets. Solomon‚Äôs royal table is described as providing such a variety of foods that the Queen of Sheba is said to have been amazed that the reports of Solomon‚Äôs wealth did not exceed what she had seen (). Royal entertainment in Israel included music (), large numbers of guests (), and presumably many servers and cupbearers, though these are not expressly mentioned in the Bible. Feasts and banquets were important social and political tools throughout Israel‚Äôs history, especially in the early years of the Israelite monarchy, when an invitation to the king‚Äôs table was important for creating and maintaining political support and was also an important marker of social status and influence. Regular meals too, developed as expressions of common identity, social unity and communal celebration. By the Roman period, Jewish communities came together at banquets for both food and company and the weekly Sabbath meal was an occasion for families to gather and enjoy both food and company. =Hospitality= Depiction of Abraham hosting his guests The practice of hospitality was a fundamental custom of Israelite society and serving food was integral to the hosting of guests. Additionally, in ancient Israel, the belief that God had delivered Israel from slavery resulted in the social imperative and religious commandment to look after guests and strangers as an act of recognition and gratitude. The importance of hospitality to the Israelites can be inferred from the texts of the Bible, in numerous instances, including the stories of Abraham hosting the messengers, Gideon‚Äôs call to leadership (), the hospitality of the woman from Zarephath towards the Prophet Elijah () and the Shunammite woman towards Elisha (), David‚Äôs hosting of Mephiboshet, son of Jonathan () and Hezekiah‚Äôs invitation to the people of the northern kingdom of Israel to celebrate the Passover in Jerusalem (). Meals at which important guests were present were viewed as special occasions, and as such, meat was served. The order in which the guests were served indicated the recognition of the social status of the guest. The choice of meat and dishes indicated the importance of the occasion. The Bible illustrates this in relating how Samuel hosted Saul, who, seated at the head of the hall is served first with a portion of meat that has been especially reserved for him (). Certain parts of the animal, such as the breast and the right thigh, were considered to be the best portions and were reserved for the most honored participants in the meal. Guests were always served before family members. The host would also sit with the guests to encourage them to eat and see to all their needs, as related in the story of Abraham, who waited on his visitors while they ate. =Sacrificial meals= Sacrificial meals were eaten when a portion of a sacrifice was reserved for the priest (kohen) or the ordinary Israelite who brought the offering was permitted to eat a portion with his family at a festive meal. The offerings considered ‚Äúmost holy‚Äù were eaten by the males of the priests in the court of the Temple sanctuary (). The meal was considered to be a part of the priest‚Äôs duties. Other offerings could be eaten by the priests with their families in any ritually clean place (). The ordinary Israelite had to eat his share within a fixed time, with his family, guests, and any Levites and strangers that he invited. Depending on the type of sacrifice, the animals that were brought as sacrifices could be a lamb, kid, goat, ram, calf, bull or cow; bird offerings were doves and turtledoves (pigeons). Of these, the guilt offering (asham) () and the communal peace offering (shalmei tzibur) () were eaten only by the male priests (kohanim). Other offerings, such as the Firstborn offering (), could be eaten by the priests and other members of their households, while for the personal peace offering (shalmei yachid) () and Thanksgiving offering (), the breast and thigh meat were eaten by the priests and other members of their households and the remainder by ordinary Israelites. The Tithe offering () could be eaten by anyone and the Passover offering () was eaten by all who had purchased a share in the sacrifice. Meal offerings called mincha all consisted primarily of flour and were either completely or partially burned on the altar. Those not entirely burned on the altar were eaten by the priests. Some mincha offerings were fried or baked before being offered. Types of mincha included fine flour (solet) mixed with oil and of which a portion was given to the kohen; flour mixed with oil and fried on a griddle or on a pan; bread called challot mixed with oil and baked in an oven; and wafers (rekikim) smeared with oil baked in an oven. There were also baked goods, all made of wheat flour and baked in an oven, which were not burned on the altar. These were the twelve unleavened and specially shaped showbreads, eaten by the priests after they had been displayed; two loaves of leavened bread prepared for the festival of Shavuot and eaten by the priests; thanksgiving breads, which included leavened bread, unleavened bread, unleavened wafers and scalded loaves, with one of each kind given to the priests and the remainder eaten by the owner and guests; and the unleavened loaves and wafers accompanying the Nazirite‚Äôs sacrificial ram, one of each kind given to the priests and the remainder eaten by the Nazirite and guests. Whole extended families or clans also participated in a sacrifice that was offered on occasions such as the New Moon, and it is referred to as both the ‚Äúsacrifice of days‚Äù and a kinship sacrifice. In the early Israelite period, before the centralization of sacrificial offerings as an exclusive part of the Temple services, these sacrifices were offered at various locations. David is described as leaving Saul‚Äôs table to participate with his family in Bethlehem () and Elkanah goes to Shiloh to participate with his household in the annual sacrifice (). Perhaps the oldest and most important feast celebrated by the Jews is the Passover. The original feast, with its origins in the story of the Exodus, consisted of a sacrificial lamb, bitter herbs and unleavened bread eaten by each family at home. Under the Israelite monarchy, and with the establishment of the Temple in Jerusalem, the sacrifice and celebration of Passover became centralized as one of the three pilgrimage festivals. Families who were able to travel to Jerusalem ate the Passover meal together in Jerusalem. Those who could not make the pilgrimage celebrated the holiday by holding a special meal and observing the Feast of Unleavened Bread. Forbidden foods In addition to requiring that certain foods be eaten for sacred purposes, the Israelite diet was shaped by religious practices which prohibited the consumption of certain foods, both in terms of the animals permissible for eating, and the manner of their preparation. The cuisine of the Israelites thus differed from that of their neighbors in significant ways. For example, ancient Mesopotamian recipes describe foods cooked with animal blood and milk added to meat stews; this would have been avoided by the ancient Israelites. Only animals specifically slaughtered for food or for use in the sacrificial service could be eaten. Detailed lists of which animals, birds, and fish could be eaten and which were prohibited appear in the Bible ( and ), and animal bones found in the archaeological record tend to support this, with some exceptions. For the Israelites, food was one way for self- definition. While it is impossible to know to what extent dietary laws were observed, self-definition is most likely the basis for certain biblical lists of different kinds of animals permitted or forbidden for consumption. The taboo against eating certain animals, particularly the pig, may have developed from the early Iron Age.Borowski, Every Living Thing, 140‚Äì44 Archaeological evidence from various sites shows that the consumption of pork, while limited, was higher in the early Iron Age but had mostly disappeared during the later Iron Age. Sites in the highlands and the coastal plains show low levels of pig utilization in the early Iron Age, but on the coastal plain, excavations such as Ekron show a higher consumption of pig; this is usually associated with the arrival of the Philistines. However, even at Philistine sites, pig remains were a small proportion of the bones discovered, and these decline after the initial period of settlement. This may have been due to unsuitable environmental factors for raising pigs. At archaeological excavations at Mount Ebal in Samaria, from the period immediately after the Israelite conquest, animal bones discovered were only from animals considered permissible, such as cattle, sheep, goats, and deer. In addition, some taboos did not relate to the source of the food but to the way in which they were prepared, as in the prohibition against boiling a young goat in its mother‚Äôs milk (and mentioned in the Bible in three separate instances: , , ). Milk and its by-products served as offerings in Near Eastern pagan worship to gods and kings. Milk was used in connection with the phenomenon of reproduction, and a goat kid would be cooked in its mother's milk. Thus, the Israelite practice was to avoid an act similar to that carried out by the Canaanites as part of their cult worship (). The Israelites believed that since an animal‚Äôs blood represented its life, its blood should not be consumed (). The blood of a slaughtered animal was thus drained before the meat was used and the blood itself was not used as a cooking liquid or drink. There are no biblical lists containing forbidden plants, so it can be assumed that any plant or fruit was permissible as food, with their use limited only by taste, or toxicity (for example, ) and the fulfillment of religious requirements such as the tithes.

He was part of a trio of colorful sportscasters in New Orleans from the beginning of the 1960s extending up until almost 2000. The others were Wayne Mack of the New Orleans NBC affiliate WDSU-TV, and Buddy Diliberto of then New Orleans ABC affiliate WVUE-TV. All three had distinct personas, fitting of New Orleans's unique culture, with Glaudi being known as the \\"Dean of New Orleans Sportscasters\\".http://www.nola.com/opinions/index.ssf/2012/02/hap_glaudi_left_his_mark_on_ne.html Photographs of Hap Glaudi appear at the Radio Theatre of New Orleans website.  Early life and education  A lifelong resident of New Orleans, Lloyd Alfred Glaudi was born on November 7, 1912. He attended Jesuit High School (New Orleans), giving him his first connection to institutions owned and operated by the Society of Jesus. It was at Jesuit High School that Glaudi earned the moniker \\"Hap\\", as he was always happy and that characterization was contracted to \\"Hap\\". Fellow broadcaster Ron Brocato reported that Glaudi himself financed his high school education through fortunate winnings at the horse race track. Brocato reported, \\"He [Glaudi] earned his tuition betting on a winning longshot at the Fair Grounds given to him by a bookie.\\" During his freshman year at Jesuit High he entered the English Writing Contest with a story about an exercise boy at the New Orleans Fairgrounds who discovers a criminal plot. His story won the Gold Medal and the then school president told Hap he wouldn't have to pay tuition in the future. Glaudi continued to higher education at Loyola University of New Orleans, maintaining strong ties to the Society of Jesus. Glaudi commenced his professional journalism career with the now defunct New Orleans Item newspaper, one of two major daily afternoon newspapers serving New Orleans at the time. During Glaudi's 25-year tenure with the Item, Glaudi became feature sportswriter for high school sports in the Greater New Orleans area, endearing him to many locals. Prep sports, together with horse racing, became particular areas of passion for Glaudi as a sports journalist. Healthy competition at the time between Glaudi and New Orleans Times-Picayune sports writer N. Charles Wicker made this a \\"Golden Age of Prep Sports\\", according to journalist Brocato's reports.  Television broadcasting career  Hap Glaudi's transition to broadcast journalism coincided with the rise of local television news, as afternoon daily newspapers declined in circulation. Glaudi became WWL-TV's lead sportscaster in 1964, a tenure that would extend until 1978. It is noteworthy that Jesuit- educated Glaudi would sign on professionally with then Jesuit-owned WWL-TV, true to his Jesuit roots. During this time, WWL-TV emerged as the premier local television news station in New Orleans, with Glaudi as lead sportscaster. As WWL-TV's evening news long remained at the top of the local television ratings, and with Glaudi handling the sports portion of the evening news, the local broadcast community informally dubbed Glaudi the \\"Dean of New Orleans Sportscasters\\". With a soft spot for horse racing and prep sports, these remained a focal point of Glaudi's broadcasts, continuing even after the arrival of the New Orleans Saints to the market in 1967. He was often teamed with newscasters Garland Robinette and Angela Hill as well as meteorologists Al Duckworth and Nash Roberts, providing a team chemistry with considerable appeal to the New Orleans broadcasting market. A flavor for Hap Glaudi's distinct style is easily seen in WWL-TV's own video report of Glaudi's death on December 29, 1989.WWL-TV tribute to Glaudi's passing on December 29, 1989. He was succeeded on WWL-TV by Jim Henderson. A history of New Orleans television, including Glaudi and the WWL-TV news team of the 60s and 70s has been published.Dominic Massa, New Orleans Television (Images of America), Arcadia Publishing, 2008, .  Other work  Glaudi added radio to his broadcasting outlets featuring affiliated radio station WWL (AM), which broadcast New Orleans Saints football games. Glaudi provided post-game analysis in the form of a call-in radio show variously named \\"Hap's Fifth Quarter\\" or \\"Hap's Point After\\", in addition to other broadcasting duties for WWL. Outspoken and passionate though he was about the Saints, Glaudi never took issue with even the most opinionated and overbearing of callers.Glaudi's post-game radio show for New Orleans Saints games. WWL (AM) being a 50,000 watt \\"clear-channel station\\", Glaudi's radio broadcasts were heard through much of the United States and even into Ontario, Canada. It was a result of his AM radio broadcasts that Glaudi began to have national exposure. New Orleans during the 1960s suffered a deep racial divide that extended into prep sports. Publicly prodded by Glaudi, then predominately white Jesuit High School and then predominately African-American St. Augustine High School agreed to play each other in high school basketball in 1965, being the two top New Orleans area prep basketball teams. This event commenced the end of the racial divide in high school sports in the New Orleans area. This event inspired the made-for-television movie Passing Glory. Jesuit High School (New Orleans) offers a Lloyd (Hap) Glaudi Scholarship. Glaudi was the first sportscaster to be named to the New Orleans Prep Sports Hall of Fame.  Personal life  Glaudi appeared in a December 19, 1964, episode of CBS-TV's hit show Gunsmoke, \\"Aunt Thede,\\" in a bit part as a Townsman. A common practice at the time was for the major networks to select individuals that they perceived as local celebrities to take bit parts in the parent network's popular television shows both to promote their show and their affiliates. Glaudi lived in New Orleans all of his life, with his wife Millie and three daughters, who maintain close ties to the Greater New Orleans area, until his death of lung cancer at age 77, on December 29, 1989.

It has been shown to be a distinct species incapable of cross-breeding and phylogenetically removed from other species of Pleurotus. P. tuber-regium is a saprotroph found on dead wood, including Daniellia trees in Africa. As the fungus consumes the wood, it produces a sclerotium, or storage tuber, either within the decaying wood or in the underlying soil. These sclerotia are round, dark brown with white interiors, and up to 30 cm wide. The fruiting bodies then emerge from the sclerotium. Both the sclerotium and the fruiting bodies are edible. In addition to being saprotrophic, P. tuber-regium is also nematophagous, catching nematodes by paralyzing them with a toxin. P. tuber- regium has a history of economic importance in Africa as food and as a medicinal mushroom. Industrial cultivation is not yet common, but studies have shown P. tuber-regium can be grown on organic wastes such as corn, sawdust, cardboard. Mycelial growth occurs between 15 ¬∞C and 40 ¬∞C, with an optimum growth rate at 35 ¬∞C. A recent study demonstrated that polysaccharides of P. tuber-regium are able to delay the progression of diabetes and associated complications in rats with insulin resistance [7]. P. tuber-regium can degrade polyethylene film. References 7. Huang H.Y., Mallikarjuna Korivi, Chaing Y.Y., Chien T.Y., and Tsai Y.C. (2012).

It includes poposaurids, shuvosaurids, ctenosauriscids, and other unusual pseudosuchians such as Qianosuchus and Lotosaurus. However, it excludes most large predatory quadrupedal \\"rauisuchians\\" such as rauisuchids and \\"prestosuchids\\". Those reptiles are now allied with crocodylomorphs (crocodile ancestors) in a clade known as Loricata, which is the sister taxon to the poposauroids in the clade Paracrocodylomorpha. Although it was first formally defined in 2007, the name \\"Poposauroidea\\" has been used for many years. The group has been referred to as Poposauridae by some authors, although this name is often used more narrowly to refer to the family that includes Poposaurus and its close relatives. Poposauroids went extinct at the end of the Triassic period along with other non-crocodylomorph pseudosuchians. However, they were among the most diverse and long-lasting members of non-crocodylomorph Pseudosuchia, with Xilousuchus (a ctenosauriscid) living near the very beginning of the Triassic and Effigia (a shuvosaurid) surviving up until near the end of the Triassic. Despite the high level of diversity and anatomical disparity within Poposauroidea, certain features of the clade can be determined, particularly in the structure of the snout and pelvis (hip). Many of these features are examples of convergent evolution with dinosaurs, with bipedal poposauroids such as Poposaurus and shuvosaurids having been mistaken for theropod dinosaurs in the past.  Description  Poposauroidea was a diverse group of pseudosuchians, containing genera with many different ecological adaptations. Some (Poposaurus and shuvosaurids) were short-armed bipeds, while others (ctenosauriscids and Lotosaurus) were robust quadrupeds with elongated neural spines, creating a 'sail' like that of certain \\"pelycosaurs\\" (like Dimetrodon) and spinosaurids. Lotosaurus and shuvosaurids were toothless and presumably beaked herbivores while Qianosuchus, Poposaurus and ctenosauriscids were sharp-toothed predators. The ecological disparity of many members of this clade means that it is difficult to assess what the ancestral poposauroid would have looked like. = Skull and vertebrae = The skull of Qianosuchus, the earliest-diverging genus of poposauroid. Note the arrangement and structure of skull bones around the enlarged nares. Poposauroids can be differentiated from other pseudosuchians by the structure of the tip of the snout, particularly the premaxillary bone which lies in front of the nares (nostril holes). This bone possesses two bony extensions (\\"processes\\") which wrap around the nares. The anterodorsal process, which wraps above the nares to contact the nasal bones on the top edge of the snout, is typically quite short in pseudosuchians. However, poposauroids have elongated anterodorsal processes, longer than the main premaxillary body. The posterodorsal process, which wraps below the nares to contact the maxilla on the side of the snout, possesses the opposite state. It is much shorter in poposauroids (compared to other pseudosuchians), restricted to only a portion of the lower edge of the nares. This has the added effect of allowing the maxilla to form the rest of the hole's lower and rear edge, with the front edge of the maxilla becoming concave as well. Although these snout features are rare among pseudosuchians, they are much more common in certain avemetatarsalians (bird-line archosaurs) such as pterosaurs and saurischian dinosaurs. The rear branch of the maxilla tapers in most poposauroids, with the exception of Qianosuchus. This contrasts with loricatans, in which this branch is rectangular in shape. However, poposauroids also possess several features which are unusual compared to archosaurs in general. For example, in most archosaurs each side of the braincase possesses a pit from where the internal carotid arteries may exit the brain. In early poposauroids, these pits migrated to the underside of the braincase, thereby resembling the primitive condition seen in archosaur relatives such as Euparkeria and proterochampsians. Nevertheless, this reversion is undone in shuvosaurids (and possibly earlier, although no braincase material is known in Poposaurus or Lotosaurus). In addition, most poposauroids possessed elongated necks, and all of them had long and thin cervical ribs. This second neck trait contrasts with the condition in other pseudosuchians, phytosaurs, and pterosaurs, which have short and stout cervical ribs. The neural spines of the dorsal (back) vertebrae are thin and plate-like, even in members of Poposauroidea without sails. This differs compared to the vertebrae of most other early pseudosuchians (as well as Euparkeria and phytosaurs), which have neural spines that expand outwards to form a flat, rectangular surface when seen from above. = Hip =  Pelvis  Like other reptiles, the pelvis of poposauroids is formed by three plate- like bones: the ilium which lies above the acetabulum (hip socket), the pubis which is below and in front of the acetabulum, and the ischium which is below and behind the acetabulum. The ilium is a large, complex bone, with a forward- pointing (preacetabular) process, a rear-pointing (postacetabular) process, and a lower portion which forms the upper edge of the acetabulum. In most archosaurs, the lower portion of the ilium is wedge-shaped, forming the inner face of a \\"closed\\" acetabulum. However, in poposauroids the lower portion of the ilium is concave, creating a partially to completely \\"open\\" acetabulum formed by open space instead of bone. The only other archosaurs with open hip sockets are dinosaurs and (to a lesser extent) crocodylomorphs. The upper edge of the acetabulum is formed by a pronounced ridge on the ilium, known as a supraacetabular rim or crest. The pelvis of Poposaurus, showing the many traits unique to poposauroid hips. Although all poposauroids possessed open acetabula, most other specializations of the ilium did not evolve until the clade containing Poposaurus and the shuvosaurids. For example, the supraacetabular crest projects downwards, rather than outwards in this clade. This trait is rare in archosaurs, only evolving independently in a few early theropod dinosaurs such as Coelophysis and Dilophosaurus. Another feature is the presence of an additional diagonal crest which branches upwards from the supraacetabular rim. Although such a crest evolved independently in a number of different archosaurs, this specific subset of poposauroids is unique in having the crest be inclined forwards (rather than vertical) and confluent with the elongated preacetabular blade, which is another derived feature of the clade. The pubis and ischium were also specialized in poposauroids. In every other archosaur, the two bones contact each other on the lower edge of the acetabulum. However, in poposauroids other than Qianosuchus and Lotosaurus, the bones do not touch, leaving the acetabulum open not only from the sides, but also from below. The width of the pubis is variable at different parts of its shaft. The portion near the acetabulum is thickened, but the tip of the bone (except in Qianosuchus) is very thin when seen head- on. In most other archosaurs, the pubis has a consistent width. However, theropod dinosaurs and a few other archosaurs have a distal part of the pubis which is thinner than the proximal part. Shuvosaurids and Lotosaurus also possessed ischia (on either side of the body) which were fused to each other at the midline of the body.  Sacrum  Although the ancestral archosaur only had two sacral (hip) vertebrae, many different archosaur groups acquired additional sacral vertebrae over the course of their evolution. Nesbitt (2011) argued that additional sacral vertebrae formed between these two 'primordial' vertebrae. He gave the well-preserved sacrum of the poposauroid Arizonasaurus as evidence to this process. Poposauroids have three to four sacral vertebrae, with the last and third-to-last vertebrae articulating with the ilium in a way similar to the two primordial vertebrae of more primitive archosauriformes such as Euparkeria and phytosaurs. The second-to-last vertebra has a form unlike the vertebrae of these archosauriforms, and Nesbitt concluded that it was an 'insertion', formed from the innermost sections of the two primordial vertebrae. Although this process is not unique to poposauroids, it is only known in a few other archosaur lineages, such as Batrachotomus, silesaurids, and dinosaurs. Basal poposauroids such as Arizonasaurus and Qianosuchus only had three sacral vertebra, with the second vertebra being the 'insertion'. However, more advanced poposauroids such as Poposaurus and shuvosaurids have four sacral vertebrae, with the third vertebra being recognizable as the 'insertion'. This means that the first vertebra must have been another addition, seemingly the last dorsal vertebra which had been repurposed and transformed into a sacral vertebra. This incorporated dorsal vertebra is known as a 'dorsosacral'. The presence of dorsosacrals is a trait with an irregular distribution among archosaurs, being known in a few ornithosuchids and aetosaurs as well as a variety of dinosaurs (most commonly in ornithischians and theropods) In almost all archosariforms, the sacral ribs of the first 'primordial' sacral vertebra contact the ilium near the base of that bone, close to its contact with the pubis. However, poposauroids have first 'primordial' sacral ribs with additional forward branches, which lie on the inner edge of the ilium's preacetabular blade. In poposauroids more advanced than Qianosuchus, the sacral vertebrae fuse into a single bone, the sacrum. This fusion occurred incrementally, at different portions of the vertebra. For example, the zygapophyses fused together as early as the ctenosauriscids. The centra (main cylindrical portion) of the sacral vertebrae also may have fused as early as the ctenosauriscids. The bases of the neural arches (the portion of the vertebrae above the spinal cord) were fused in some ctenosauriscids (Arizonasaurus) but not others (Bromsgroveia), and were also fused in all poposauroids more advanced than the ctenosauriscids. = Other features = Unlike most pseudosuchians, poposauroids lack bony scutes known as osteoderms. The only exception to this is Qianosuchus, which possessed numerous tiny osteoderms, lying in a row extending down the neck and body. In all poposauroids, the tip of the fibula (outer shin bone) is symmetrical and straight when seen from the side, rather than slanted as in other non- crocodylomorph pseudosuchians. Poposauroids more advanced than ctenosauriscids had flattened, \\"hoof-like\\" pedal unguals (toe claws). Some poposauroids had very short arms compared to the length of their legs, although disarticulation in Qianosuchus and a lack of limb material in ctenosauriscids means that it is unknown whether this trait was basal to the group as a whole. Missing data for ctenosauriscids also obscures when certain traits of the caudal (tail) vertebrae and ankle bones were gained or lost within Poposauroidea. History Franz Nopcsa first used the term Poposauridae in 1923 to refer to poposauroids. At this time, the sole member of the group was Poposaurus, which was considered to be a theropod dinosaur. Over the following years, poposauroids were placed in various groups, including Saurischia, Theropoda, and Carnosauria. This classification existed up until the 1970s, when better remains indicated that Poposaurus was a pseudosuchian rather than a dinosaur. Other genera such as Sillosuchus and Shuvosaurus were later erected. Like Poposaurus, Shuvosaurus was originally thought to be a theropod dinosaur. Sankar Chatterjee reclassified poposauroids as theropod dinosaurs with his description of the new genus Postosuchus in 1985. Chatterjee even considered poposauroids to be the ancestors of tyrannosaurs. Postosuchus was widely considered to be a poposauroid for the next ten years and was included in many phylogenetic analyses of Triassic archosaurs. In 1995, Robert Long and Phillip A Murry noted that several specimens referred to Postosuchus were distinct from the holotype, and so they assigned those specimens to the new genera Lythrosuchus and Chatterjeea. In 2005, Sterling Nesbitt noted that \\"ctenosauriscids\\" such as Arizonasaurus, Bromsgroveia, and Lotosaurus shared many similarities with \\"poposaurids\\" such as Poposaurus, Sillosuchus, and \\"Chatterjeea\\" (now known as Shuvosaurus). He proposed that they formed a clade (informally named \\"Group X\\") to the exception of other pseudosuchians. \\"Group X\\" was formally given the name \\"Poposauroidea\\" by Jonathan C. Weinbaum and Axel Hungerb√ºhler in 2007. In their paper, Weinbaum and Hungerb√ºhler described two new skeletons of Poposaurus and incorporated several new characters of the genus into a phylogenetic analysis. Poposauroidea was recovered as a monophyletic grouping, while other rauisuchians (namely Rauisuchidae and Prestosuchidae) were placed as basal forms of a new group called Paracrocodyliformes. Brusatte et al. (2010) conducted a phylogenetic study of archosaurs that resulted in a grouping referred to as Poposauroidea. Unlike many recent studies, they found Rauisuchia to be monophyletic, consisting of two major clades: Rauisuchoidea and Poposauroidea. However, the monophyly of Rauisuchia was not strongly supported in Brusatte et al.'s analysis. They noted that if their tree was enlarged by one step, Poposauroidea fell outside Rauisuchia to become the sister group of Ornithosuchidae, which is thought to closely related to, but outside, Rauisuchia. In their tree, Poposauroidea included genera usually classified as poposauroids as well as several other genera that were not previously placed in the group. One of these genera, Qianosuchus, is unique among pseudosuchians in its semiaquatic lifestyle. Qianosuchus mixtus, an unusual semiaquatic archosaur that was placed as the most basal poposauroid in Nesbitt's phylogenetic analysis. In his massive revision of archosaurs which included a large cladistic analysis, Sterling J. Nesbitt (2011) found Xilousuchus to be a poposauroid most closely related to Arizonasaurus. Nesbitt's analysis did not recover a monophyletic Rauisuchia or monophyletic Rauisuchoidea. Poposauroidea was found to be monophyletic, and more resolved than in previous analyses, with Qianosuchus as the most basal member of the group and Lotosaurus grouping with shuvosaurids instead of ctenosauriscids. The cladogram below follows Nesbitt (2011) with clade names based on previous studies.

History Originally consecrated in 1665, and then rebuilt in 1789, it was elevated to Cathedral status in 1825 with the appointment of Bishop Coleridge to head the newly created Diocese of Barbados and the Leeward Islands. The first parish church to be built was St. Michael's Parish Church, which was located where St. Mary's Anglican Church now stands. The original St. Michael's Parish Church was a small wooden church constructed between 1660 and 1665. Destroyed by a hurricane in 1780, the church was rebuilt nine years later. The church was later damaged in the great hurricane of 1831 but not destroyed. When the Diocese of Barbados was established, St. Michael's Parish Church became St. Michael's Cathedral, with Bishop William Hart Coleridge as its first bishop in 1825. St. Michael Cathedral is made of coral stone with a beautiful tower and stunning stained glass windows. Inside the church is a marble baptismal font dating to the 17th century.

It usually specifies a particular program. The government may at the same time prohibit non-governmental organizations from advocating for any other feminist program.  About  State feminism is when the government or the state adopts policies that are beneficial to women's rights and the improvement of women's lives. The term was coined by Helga Hernes in 1987. Feminist theorists in the 1980s had begun to reconsider the role that governments could have on positive outcomes for women's lives. A state, as a system, could support the interests of different classes, genders and \\"racial hierarchies.\\" It could also support a diverse number of programs that have different levels of support within government or society. Women who study state feminism look at the effectiveness of various government programs, and how they improve women's rights and their status in their localities. Some researchers, such as Elisabeth Friedman, have suggested that it is essential that there is a strong women's movement that works independent of the state in order for state feminism to be successful. In Australia and the Netherlands those involved with the promotion of state feminism can be called \\"femocrats.\\" It can also be useful to apply the concept of state feminism to examine the policies towards women in countries that have a strong central state, such as Japan. The idea of state feminism is often conflated with the creation of women's policy agencies in governments. However, the creation of such policies does not mean that feminist outcomes are taking place Research Network on Gender Politics and the State (RNGS). Basically, state feminism should not be confused with the action taken in regards to agencies in the government that support policies for women, according to Dorothy E. McBride and Amy G. Mazur in \\"Women's Policy Agencies and State Feminism.\\" McBride and Mazur identify two types of state feminism: \\"Movement State Feminism\\" and \\"Transformative State Feminism.\\" The former describes when the government reacts to the women's movement in a place by creating policies that promote \\"demands based on gender consciousness, women's solidarity, and the cause of women.\\" The transformative process is where the demands already started within the state become \\"explicitly feminist\\" and work towards full gender equality and the possibility of transforming relationships between genders. State feminism can also drive a government to become more broadly democratic in nature.  Turkey  In the 20th century, Turkey's government \\"preempted feminism\\". The Turkish national government's program in the 1920s included mandatory de- hijabicization (unveiling of women), access for women to more education and work, and political rights for women, all as part of a national effort to emulate some Western cultural characteristics in a Muslim nation. In the 1980s, second-wave feminism appeared, among daughters of leading women of Turkey's Kemalist movement, the women being feminist within the government's definition and leadership. The state feminism they followed, according to scholar Margot Badran, covered parts of patriarchy with an appearance of Western progressivity.  Yemen  In South Yemen, also known as the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen (with the subsequent unification of two Yemen's into one, the former PDRY is now generally south Yemen), state feminism had little effect on patriarchy and did not have much influence beyond Aden, a port city in the PDRY. \\"Women in the south ... seemed to believe their gains would never be rescinded. They behaved as feminists, if by that is meant shaping the lives of their choice by accessing the new options offered them. But they did not embrace a feminist ideology or identity, as this was preempted by the state. When the socialist regime collapsed, the fragile gains of state feminism went with it.\\" \\"Northern women had acquired an acute gender consciousness and developed practical feminist skills ... but they had no legitimate political space. Southern women had been able to exploit the educational and professional benefits conferred under state feminism, but they did not have the independent ideological space in which to develop a feminism of their own.\\" Post-unification Yemen has been analyzed by one author., citing  Sweden   Middle East  In the 1980s and 1990s, \\"feminist activists and scholars in the Middle East assailed the limits of 'state feminism' and exposed its patriarchal dimensions.\\"  Communist and socialist regimes  \\"Sharon Wesoky characterized the relationship of an emergent women's movement to the [Chinese] state as 'symbiotic,' containing elements of both autonomy and dependence, and operating largely within rather than in opposition to party-state institutions.\\" State feminisms' have been discredited elsewhere as well [e.g., in China] following the collapse of communist and socialist regimes.\\", citing  Criticism  \\"Many feminists [...] consider the notion of a state feminism to be an oxymoron.\\" Independent women's movements may be prohibited by the government. State feminism can also be a way that the government takes over the role of speaking for and on behalf of women, rather than letting women themselves speak and make demands.

The complex consists of two major buildings facing each other on al-Mu'izz li-Din Allah street (al-Muizz Street), in the Fahhamin Quarter, in the middle of the historic part of Cairo, Egypt. The eastern side of the complex includes the Sultan's mausoleum, a khanqah, a sabil (water distribution kiosk), and a kuttab (Islamic primary school), while the western side of the complex is a mosque and madrasa. Today the mosque-madrasa is still open as a mosque while the khanqah-mausoleum is open to visitors as a historic site. History A well-known drawing of the Ghuriya buildings and the market street in between them, made by David Roberts in 1839.The second last of the Mamluk sultans, Sultan Qansuh al-Ghuri was the last Mamluk sultan to enjoy a reign of any duration (1501‚Äì16). He was called 'Al-Ghuri' after the barracks Al-Ghuri, where he was garrisoned.Behrens- Abouseif, Doris. \\"Cairo of the Mamluks\\". Cairo:AUC Press, 2008. p 295 He was the governor of Tarsus, then the chamberlain of Aleppo and he was involved heavily in the military campaign against the Ottomans in 1484. Al-Ghuri died of a heart attack while fighting the Ottoman Turks outside Aleppo, following the defection of Amir Khayrbak in the midst of the battle. His body was never found, and was not buried in his mausoleum on which he had spent a fortune. Like other Sultans of his time, Al-Ghuri is portrayed as energetic, cruel, superstitious and despot leader. Harsh punishments were imposed on people during his reign for crimes committed or during money collection. Despite cruelty, Al-Ghuri had a huge fond of music, poetry and flowers and was attracted to Sufis and other pious men. He was a great patron of architecture, and a man of refined cultural tastes. Although the economic conditions was somewhat miserable, the sultan pursued to the very end of his reign a passion for regal pomp, spending considerable funds and confiscating properties to build representative buildings. Layout The funerary complex has a remarkable layout as a double architectural composition, with two blocks straddling the main street in the heart of medieval Cairo. There are two blocks: the western - consisting of a mosque with its minaret; the eastern one is a funerary complex, consisting of a mausoleum, a hall called Khanqah, a maq'ad (reception hall), a graveyard and a sabil-kuttab.Behrens-Abouseif, Doris. \\"Cairo of the Mamluks\\". Cairo:AUC Press, 2008. p 296 Both the buildings are built above shops connected to markets stretching along the side street. To provide shade for the street a wooden roof links the buildings. Although the dome and the minaret are separated by the street, they were conceived as a single, harmonious composition and were united by blue ceramic decoration. These blue ceramics are similar to the blue ceramic decoration other the sultan's minaret at Al-Azhar.Behrens-Abouseif, Doris. \\"Cairo of the Mamluks\\". Cairo:AUC Press, 2008. p 297 The complex was designed to reveal its minaret- and-dome composition to an onlooker coming from the south. Unlike other religious complexes, the facades of the complex are not adjusted to the street alignment. They rather follow the orientation of the two sides of the complex. This creates a square and is semi-enclosed at the north end by the projection of the sabil-kuttab of the mausoleum, and at the south end by the projection of the minaret of the madrasa. The open space was rented to people to create market stalls. The market and the rents helped pay for the upkeep of al- Ghuri's complex. Mosque The facades of the two buildings are not identical, however they have similar features such as the high-relief carving running along their upper walls. The portal recesses have marble paneling in variations of black and white. The columns at the corner of the mosque have capitals of Coptic and Byzantine styles, indicating that the Mamluk craftsmen were imitating pre-Islamic designs. The huge minaret is visible from near Bab Zuwayla, and is a four storied rectangular tower of a considerable height. This tower had a four-headed upper structure and was the first of its kind to be built in Cairo. The present top with five-headed structure is a modern addition after the collapse of the top in the nineteenth century. The interior is richly paved and paneled with black and white marble. However the stone carving covers the walls but it is of poor quality, shallow and repetitive. Khanqah and mausoleum The main facade of the funerary compound is paneled with recesses crowned with a rectangular muqarnas crest, including windows of various shapes.Behrens-Abouseif, Doris. \\"Cairo of the Mamluks\\". Cairo:AUC Press, 2008. p 300 The main portal leads to an unusual vestibule with two opposite entrances, the one on the right-hand side leading to the mausoleum and the other to the khanqah. On the northern edge a sabil-kuttab projects into the street with three facades. The mausoleum on the south side of the interior presently has only its rectangular base and transition zone. The dome, made of brick and covered completely with green tiles, collapsed at the beginning of the century. On the left or north side of the entrance resides the khanqah, though no living units were attached to it. The waqf deed says that Sufis had their meetings there, but there are no living accommodations provided for them. however, there are a few living units attached to the madrasa across the street. The khanqah is a T shaped hall with a mihrab, decorated like the mausoleum and the Mosque with a polychrome marble dado and pavement. Each of the three mihrabs of the complex has a distinct pattern of marble mosaics. The polychrome marble pavement of the sabil, displaying a dense composition of twenty-pointed geometric stars, is one of the most elaborate in Cairo.Behrens-Abouseif, Doris. \\"Cairo of the Mamluks\\".

Located in present-day Abia State, under the governance of Umuahia North Local Government, it is predominantly inhabited by Igbo people who speak a slightly different dialect of Igbo. The neighbouring kingdoms near Ibeku are interconnected by history and culture. To the south are the kingdom of Olokoro, Afor Ibeji, Amakama, Ubakala. To the east is Oboro. West are the clans of Umuokpara and Ohuhu. Then north are Uzuakoli and Abiriba. These areas were one time a part of what was called the Bende region in now Abia State. Ibeku people are a good portion of the Igbo (Ibo) speaking people of Nigeria. Igbo is spoken throughout West Africa in various dialects. Ibeku people have custodians of these traditional values in each of the seven clans called Egwu Asaa that make up Ibeku Nation. These seven Clans are Osaa, Amaforo, Ndume, Afaraukwu, Emede, Isieke, Afarata. Each has an Eze that is titled accordingly with a name to reflect that clan. Ibeku clan has a Royal Highness with the title Ogurube Ibeku. The present Ogurube is His Royal Highness Eze Samuel Iheonu Onuaha, The Ogurube IV of Ibeku. His cabinet is made up of all the Eze from the seven egwu asaas. These individual egwus are autonomous in terms of organization in localities headed by their own Eze. History The history of Ibeku can be traced through present-day Igbo culture, tradition (omenala) and heritage, archives, archeology and various methods used in organization of its people. The lack and in places paucity of data has tended to encourage unrestrained speculation which in fact largely accounts for some insupportable hypotheses being put forward by many early or pioneer archaeologists, concerning the nature of culture change in Ibeku, Umuahia-Ibeku, eastern Nigeria. One of such flawed hypotheses was that the peopling of the forest region (southern Nigeria and indeed, all of the Guinea zone of West Africa) was a much later development than that of the northern open savanna area. Recent archaeological research has shown that people were already living in western Nigeria (specifically Iwo-Eleru at Isarun, Ondo state) as early as 9000 BC and perhaps earlier at Ugwuelle-Uturu (Okigwe) in south-eastern Nigeria (Shaw and Daniels 1984: 7-100). This is the area of Ibeku clan. Lack of adequate funding and dating facilities has also caused a lag in archaeological research in ibeku area of Nigeria and indeed, all of West Africa. Many sites threatened by construction work such as bridges, roads, houses and dams are not normally rescued because there are no sources of funding. The governments, both state and federal have not been supportive enough of archaeological work, partly because both the leaders and the peoples do not recognize the role a sound knowledge of the past can play in nation-building. There is up to now, no well-equipped dating laboratory either to process charcoal samples or potsherds. The only laboratory in West Africa is in Senegal and it is far from being well equipped. Consequently, it is restricted mostly to processing charcoal samples collected from sites in Senegal. Given this problem, samples collected from archaeological excavations have to be sent abroad for processing. This delays the rate at which archaeological information is put into its proper time perspective. It seems also that a great deal more time and attention are paid to the later phases of human settlement history than the earlier. Consequently, much more is known of Iron Age and historic settlements in Ibeku as a whole. Some considerable amount of work has been done for these phases in Benin City in Nigeria, Niani in Niger Republic and Jenne-Jeno in Mali, among other places in West Africa. One reason for this interest in the later phase seems to rest in the fact that there is a meeting point between historic settlement archaeology and oral traditions in the region generally and the fact that people can identify much more easily with this phase because it is more recent and by this fact closer to our times. It is pertinent to note that there is no settlement archaeology tradition(s) in ibeku (umuahia ibeku) Nigeria up to the early 1980s. Even at places like Ife, Old-Oyo, Benin and Zaria where some relatively limited archaeological work has been carried out, efforts were mainly concentrated on walls (Soper 1981: 61-81; Darling 1984: 498-504; Leggett 1969: 27). In Southern Nigeria, where Ibeku is located, proto-historic settlements were generally composed of mud or sun-dried brick houses. Most if not all these house structures and defensive and/or demarcatory walls have either been destroyed or obliterated by erosion. The tradition(s) of constructing houses with stones in the pre colonial past was well reflected in many parts of Northern Nigeria. In fact, many hill-top settlements in this area of Nigeria were composed of stone houses - a direct response among other things, to opportunities offered by the immediate environment (Netting 1968: 18-28; Denyer 1978: 41-47). Despite the nature of the soil chemistry (acidic soil), stone buildings are still better preserved than mud houses. Relics of ancient settlements are much fewer in the south, including ibeku, than in the north, because of the different building materials as well as techniques of construction which are partly determined by diverse historical experiences among other things. Hill-tops and slopes offer abundant boulders which could be dressed for construction, while in the plains, it is much easier to obtain mud for building houses. For example, the dispersed mode of settlement of the present-day Tiv as opposed to the nucleated rural settlements on the hill-tops and slopes in ancient times, coupled with their shifting agricultural system, as well as the factor of refarming and/or resettlement of former sites by some daughter groups which hived off, from the original stock, make most ancient settlements and recently abandoned sites (made up of sun-dried brick houses) difficult to discover at least in a fairly well preserved state (Sokpo and Mbakighir 1990, Personal Communication). This preservation problem among others further make the task of establishing stratigraphic sequences a little bit difficult. Nigeria is divisible into zones on the basis of techniques of construction as follows: #Mud construction techniques which are very common in most parts of southern Nigeria and in Ibeku. #Stone construction techniques which are very common in most parts of Northern Nigeria; and #Combination of mud and stone construction techniques. This development is common in Tivland, where the ancient houses and protective walls on hill-tops were constructed of stones, while present- day houses in the plains are usually constructed of mud. Given our experiences in Ibeku (umuahia ibeku) Nigeria, the third category of construction is very useful for generating models. These are models derivable from oral traditional data and ethnographic resources. Such models, if carefully applied to archaeological situations, can greatly fill the gaps in our knowledge of the past of the Ibeku peoples.

They did record a second album in 1972 with ex-Supertramp bassist-vocalist Frank Farrell replacing the departed Alan Barry, but the record was shelved by CBS and not initially released. The master tapes of this album were re-mastered and released as Contrasts: Urban Roar to Country Peace in 2015, with the full involvement of Graham Field. According to Field, CBS management changed and \\"the new faces did not want to know us\\", so the group disbanded. Field had the rights to the name Rare Bird, and returned to working in that area and in television themes. McCulloch went on to become a founder member of Greenslade.

The subalpine district surrounds its primary structure, the Paradise Inn, a rustic-style hotel built in 1917 to accommodate visitors to the park. The Paradise Inn is a National Historic Landmark. Five other buildings are included in the district. The district was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on March 13, 1991. It is part of the Mount Rainier National Historic Landmark District, which encompasses the entire park and which recognizes the park's inventory of Park Service-designed rustic architecture. District The Paradise area had been burned by an 1885 forest fire that left a great deal of standing timber in a \\"silver forest\\", primarily Alaska Cedar. Much of this timber was harvested to build park structures, particularly the Paradise Inn. The area's chief attractions are the wildflower meadows above the built-up area. The development of the area was undertaken by the Rainier National Park Company, which built the Paradise Inn in 1917 and added the annex in 1920, as well as the Guide House the same year. Three other buildings were built by the National Park Service. The Paradise area formerly included a group of 215 frame cabins built in 1930, served by the Paradise Lodge of 1931, which were open year-round. The cabins were sold in 1942 to be used to house defense workers As part of the Mission 66 program, the Paradise area was proposed as a day-use area, with the Inn to be demolished. Public pressure resulted in the preservation of the Inn and its renovation. The Paradise Lodge was intentionally burned on June 3, 1965 to make room for parking for the new Paradise Visitor Center. Buildings The 1917 Paradise Inn is a large hotel with a prominent dormered roof, built in an \\"alpine\\" variant of the National Park Service Rustic style. The inn's interior features exposed log structure, with a high lobby housing handcrafted log furniture. Fourteen doors open off the lobby to the northeast, flanked by log buttresses that follow the slope of the roof to the ground, carrying the local snow loads. The Inn was designed by Heath, Grove and Bell, of Tacoma. Twenty-eight guest rooms were in an attached wing above the dining room, with a further wing housing suites and rooms. The Paradise Inn Annex was built in 1920, slightly downhill from and parallel to the main inn's lobby. The 3-1/2 story timber frame building is connected to the main Inn by a multi-story bridge. Designed by Seattle architect Harlan Thomas, the version finally constructed was scaled down from the originally- proposed structure, which was to be long with a central stone pavilion and exposed log framing. The portion that was built was to have been the south wing, and construction was simplified to plain framed construction, measuring by . The Guide Service Building is a 3-1/2 story timber frame structure opposite the Paradise Inn. It was built by the Rainier National Park Company in 1920 features a distinctive gambrel roof to house mountain climbing guides. The basement contains a small auditorium and stage, while the ground floor houses offices. The upper levels are dormitory spaces. The Paradise Ranger Station is a small 1-1/2 story building with a steeply-pitched cedar shingle roof. The ranger station was completed in 1922 to a design by the National Park Service Landscape Engineering Division. The roof, supported on rubblestone walls, was designed to shed the heavy winter snowfall typical of the Paradise area. A system of cables anchored to the hillside resists the downhill pressure of the snow load. The Paradise Comfort Station is a public toilet facility. It was built in 1928 to a design by the Park Service Western Region Branch of Plans and Designs, supervised by Thomas Chalmers Vint. In contrast to the ranger station, the comfort station features a strongly built low-pitched roof built in reinforced concrete. The walls were clad in stone veneer. The roof was designed to resist a snow load weighing 35 pounds per cubic foot, for a 1225-pound-per-square-foot loading. The Paradise Ski-Tow Powerhouse was built to house a portable ski-tow system. Paradise was a significant skiing venue during the 1930s, but the Park Service did not permit a permanent ski lift facility. The ski-tow house was built in 1937 by the Civilian Conservation Corps with a steeply pitched roof similar to that of the ranger station.

He specialized in the ancient cultures of present-day Ghana and Nigeria. He helped establish academic institutions, including the Ghana National Museum and the archaeology department at the University of Ghana. He began working with the University of Ibadan in 1960, where he later founded and developed its archaeology department. He led this for more than 10 years before his retirement in 1974. Igbo-Ukwu Shaw's excavations at Igbo-Ukwu, Nigeria revealed a 9th-century indigenous culture that created sophisticated work in bronze metalworking, independent of any Arab or European influence and centuries before other sites that were better known at the time of discovery. He was awarded the C.B.E. in 1972 for his contributions. In 1989, he was made a tribal chief in Nigeria. In addition, Shaw worked on expanding communications about African archaeology; in 1964, he founded the West African Archaeological Newsletter, which he edited until 1970; from 1971-1975, he edited the West African Journal of Archaeology. Early life and education Born in Plymouth, England, Thurstan Shaw was the second son of Reverend John Herbert Shaw, an Anglican priest, and Grace Irene Woollatt. He was educated at Blundell's School in Tiverton. He studied Classics at Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge University, where he added Archeology. Shaw received a B.A (1st class) in 1936 and was awarded an M.A. in 1941. Academic career Shaw was encouraged by Louis Leakey to go to the Gold Coast (later Ghana) to work in archaeology. He arrived on 15 September 1937 and started as a tutor with the Cambridge Education Committee. He was appointed Curator of the Anthropology Museum at Achimota College, holding that post until 1945. During this time he conducted the first archaeological excavations in Ghana at Dawu near Accra. He served the Cambridge Institute of Education from 1951‚Äì1964. During the 1950s, Shaw helped found and organize the collections of the Ghana National Museum and establish the archaeology department at the University of Ghana. These were part of the national institutions being developed as Ghana moved toward revived independence. They supported the study and preservation of the nation's rich heritage within its borders. In 1959, Shaw was invited by the antiquities department of Nigeria to perform an excavation at Igbo-Ukwu, where numerous ancient bronzes had been found by a villager. Igbo Ukwu is near the ancient town of Onitsha in Eastern Nigeria. Shaw's excavation revealed bronze pieces that were evidence of a sophisticated Igbo civilization from the ninth century. They marked the most-developed metalworking culture of the time.Thurstan Shaw, \\"Excavations at Igbo-Ukwu, Eastern Nigeria: An Interim Report,\\" Man, Vol. 60 (November 1960), pp. 161-164 The Igbo were working at this site centuries before the development of other bronze-working sites in what is now Nigeria. Shaw returned to the town in 1964 and conducted two more excavations. These revealed extensive bronzes, as well as thousands of trade beads, evidence of a commercial network extending to Egypt. He also found evidence of ritual practices related to burials and sacred sites.Thurstan Shaw, \\"Further Excavations at Igbo-Ukwu, Eastern Nigeria: An Interim Report\\", Man, Vol. 65 (Nov. - Dec., 1965), pp. 181-184 9th century bronze pot excavated by Shaw at Igbo-Ukwu In 1960 Shaw joined the University of Ibadan, Nigeria, where in 1963 he became Research Professor of Archaeology. He established the department of archeology, training talented archeologists, and leading the department until his retirement in 1974. Based on an assessment of his published work, Cambridge awarded Shaw a Ph.D. in 1968. From 1964‚Äì1970, Shaw was founder and editor of the West African Archaeological Newsletter. He edited the West African Journal of Archaeology from 1971‚Äì1975. He writes under both the name Thurstan Shaw and the pen name of Peter Woods.

Sportavia-P√ºtzer produced Fournier aircraft beginning in 1966, and in 1970 Fournier initiated the design of a new four- seat cabin monoplane, the Sportsman. The first prototype Sportsman first flew on 1 March 1973, but the second prototype, which made its maiden flight on 28 April 1976, was a completely redesigned version which was created by Sportavia. This redesigned model was designated the RF-6C Sportsman when it entered production in late 1976, and was renamed RS-180 Sportsman when a new empennage design was added in early 1978, following the fatal crash of the prototype in May 1977. The extensive redesign included reshaping the horizontal tail and relocating it part-way up the fin, changing the wing profile, and removing the turned-down wingtips of the RF-6C.

This design cushions the impacts of landing and damps out vertical oscillations. It is undesirable for an airplane to bounce on landing as it could lead to a loss of control, and the landing gear should not add to this tendency. A steel coil spring stores impact energy from landing and then releases it, while an oleo strut instead absorbs this energy, reducing bounce. As the strut compresses, the spring rate increases dramatically because the air is being compressed while the viscosity of the oil dampens the rebound movement. History and applications The original design for the oleo-pneumatic shock-absorbing strut was patented by British manufacturing conglomerate Vickers Armstrong during 1915. It had been derived from the recuperative gear design of the Vickers gun, controlling recoil by forcing oil through precisely sized orifices. Vickers' oleo strut was first applied to an aeroplane by the French aircraft company Breguet Aviation. The design proved to be viable and was extensively adopted across the aviation industry for fixed undercarriages, becoming simply referred to as an \\"Oleo unit\\" or undercarriage leg. However, Vicker's initial design had placed air above the oil, an arrangement that did not pose any problem until the introduction of retractable landing gear during the mid-1930s. The engineer Peter Thornhill devised a novel undercarriage strut that used a free-floating piston, not only being a lighter arrangement but enabling the whole strut to be inverted and to work while at an angle, eliminating the weakness of using an oil and air mixture. Oleo-pneumatic technology was subsequently reused by the manufacturer to produce several other products, including hydraulic railway buffers and industrial shock absorbers. During 1926, the Cleveland Pneumatic Tool Company designed and introduced its own oleo strut, one of the first to be purpose-designed for use upon airplanes. The company subsequently marketed the product as an Aerol strut, which had entered widespread use within the United States within the space of a decade.Cleveland. The Making of a City, p. 865.American Engineer's Feat Proves Boom to Aviation. Aeronautical World Journal of Commerce, 1930. Vol. 3-4, p. 34.Absorbing the Shocks. US Air Services, 1931. Vol. 16, p. 48. By 1931, innovations in the field were reportedly being made in the United Kingdom, France, and North America. During subsequent decades, the oleo strut became commonly used for aviation purposes around the world. By the twenty- first century, a wide range of different shock-absorbing struts were in use, but typically employ common principles, despite considerable variations in size, weight, and other performance criteria. Furthermore, continued refinements to the technology behind the oleo strut. During 1954, hydropneumatic suspension was introduced, which utilizes the same principle of a gas that compresses (nitrogen) and a fluid that does not; in this application, an engine-driven pump is used to pressurize the hydraulic fluid. Another such example was a US patent filed by Jarry Hydraulics during 1958. During the 1960s, the British Ministry of Technology sponsored research into theoretical studies into improved oleo-dampening technology. In 2012, it was proposed that the vibration-dampening qualities of the oleo strut could be enhanced by using semi-active control to adjust fluid viscosity. The use of oleo struts for electric-powered automatic guided vehicles has also been evaluated. According to Engineering360, by 2019, the oleo-pneumatic strut had become the most common type of shock absorber in use upon modern aircraft. In particular, the oleo strut has seen heavy use amongst the largest cargo airplanes in the world, such as the Antonov An-124 Ruslan; it reportedly provides for a rough-field landing capacity while carrying payloads of up to 150 tons. This design also cushions the airframe from the impacts of taxiing, resulting in greater levels of comfort for passengers and crew alike. The Quadro range of motor scooters use the oleo strut, which is claimed to give favourable low speed lean characteristics. Operation Antonov An-124 Ruslan landing gear An oleo strut consists of an inner metal tube or piston, which is attached to the wheel axle, and which moves up and down in an outer (or upper) metal tube, or cylinder, that is attached to the airframe. The cavity within the strut and piston is filled with gas (usually nitrogen, sometimes air‚Äîespecially on light aircraft) and oil (usually hydraulic fluid), and is divided into two chambers that communicate through a small orifice. When the aircraft is stationary on the ground, its weight is supported by the compressed gas in the cylinder. During landing, or when the aircraft taxis over bumps, the piston slides up and down. This movement compresses the gas, which acts as a spring, and forces oil through the orifice, which acts as a damper. A tapered rod is used on some designs to change the size of the orifice as the piston moves, providing greater resistance as compression of the strut increases. Additionally, a check valve is sometimes used to uncover additional orifices so that damping during compression is less than during rebound. Oleo struts absorb and dissipate forces by converting and emitting a portion of the accumulated kinetic energy into thermal energy. Pneumatic systems like the oleo strut generally have long operating lives, and the construction is not unusually complex for maintenance purposes. Nitrogen is usually used as the gas instead of air, since it is less likely to cause corrosion. The various parts of the strut are sealed with O-rings or similar elastomeric seals, and a scraper ring is used to keep dust and grit adhering to the piston from entering the strut.

It is located west of King Salmon, Alaska. The control center station was closed on 1 November 1983, and was re-designated as a Long Range Radar (LRR) site as part of the Alaska Radar System. Today, it remains active as part of the Alaska NORAD Region under the jurisdiction of the Air and Space Operations Center, Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, Alaska. History King Salmon AFS was a continental defense radar station constructed to provide the United States Air Force early warning of an attack by the Soviet Union on Alaska. The Air Force awarded a contract to construct the radar site to Gaasland & Company on 12 April 1950. Construction began shortly afterward and was completed the following year at a cost of approximately $3,667,372. King Salmon became operational as a ground controlled intercept (GCI) site in November 1951 and initially the station functioned as a GCI and warning station. As a GCI station, the squadron's role was to guide interceptor aircraft toward unidentified intruders picked up on the unit's radar scopes. Radars operated were am AN/FPS-3, AN/FPS-20A, AN/FPS-6, AN/CPS-5 (Bkup), and an AN/FPS-6B. It converted to an Air Defense Direction Center (later renamed NORAD Control Center) on 4 March 1953, and exercised control over Cape Newenham AFS and Cape Romanzof AFS. Control of the other aircraft control and warning sites in the southern sector was transferred to King Salmon when the Fire Island AFS NORAD Control Center was closed in July 1969. Initially, King Salmon AFS was maintained and operated by Detachment F-3, 531st Aircraft Control and Warning Group (AC&W; Gp). In 1952, Alaskan Air Command (ACC) decided to upgrade all the aircraft control and warning detachments to squadrons. The 705th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron was activated on 8 December 1952 and assigned to the 531st AC&W; Gp. Following the Group's inactivation on 13 April 1953, the squadron was assigned to various other headquarters, including AAC. On 15 November 1977, the squadron was reassigned to the 531st AC&W; Gp when the latter was reactivated at Elmendorf AFB. The Group was redesignated the 11th Tactical Control Group on 1 July 1981. Communications were initially provided by a high frequency radio system which proved unreliable because of atmospheric disturbances. AAC, after investigating various options, decided to build the RCA Corporation's White Alice Communications System, a system of Air Force-owned tropospheric scatter and microwave radio relay sites operated by the Air Force Communications Service (AFCS). The AFCS's 1930 Comm Sq., Det. 2 operated and maintained the facility's communications including teletype, crypto, radar tracking, and the Ground Radio and Aircraft Radio at the site as well as the MARS (Military Affiliate Radio Service). Friendly, Foe, and Unidentified aircraft vector displays were projected on the over all map of Alaska in the Operations Room. The King Salmon site was activated on 25 May 1957. It was inactivated on 3 August 1979, and replaced by an Alascom owned and operated satellite earth terminal as part of an Air Force plan to divest itself of the obsolete White Alice Communications System and transfer the responsibility to a commercial firm. On 1 October 1977, AAC, after a trial period, implemented a base support contract with RCA Services as part of an Air Force-wide effort to reduce remote tours. Twenty-eight positions were eliminated. The remaining 63 positions were primarily in operations. King Salmon was the first radar site to receive a new AN/FPS-117 minimally attended radar under AAC's SEEK IGLOO program. The unit, a prototype version, was tested at King Salmon in September 1982, then placed in 24-hour operation in December. It was designed to transmit aircraft tracking data via satellite to the Alaskan NORAD Regional Operations Control Center (ROCC), which reached initial operational capability on l5 June 1983. No longer needed, the 705 ACWS was inactivated on l November 1983 and the station re-designated as a Long Range Radar (LRR) Site. This left only contractor personnel to maintain the site radar. In 1990, jurisdiction of the King Salmon LRR Site was transferred to Pacific Air Forces' (PACAF) Eleventh Air Force with the redesignation of AAC. In 1998 PACAF initiated \\"Operation Clean Sweep\\", in which abandoned Cold War stations in Alaska were remediated and the land restored to its previous state. After years of neglect the facilities at the station had lost any value they had when the site was closed. The site remediation of the radar and support station was carried out by the 611th Civil Engineering Squadron at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, and remediation work was completed by 2005. Current status Today, very little remains of the former King Salmon Air Force Station. The site is controlled by PACAF's 611th Air & Space Operations Center, based at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, Alaska. The site is generally unattended. Because of its proximity to King Salmon Airport , only two civilian contractor maintenance and support personnel are needed to maintain the radar system.

Fryberg was sworn in on 23 September 1994, and retired in 2013. Early life and education Henry George Fryberg was born on 29 November 1943 in Brisbane, to Lt Col Abraham Fryberg, then acting director-general of health, and his wife Vivian Greensill (n√©e Barnard). Fryberg completed his primary education at Ascot State School (1949‚Äì57) and his secondary education at Brisbane Grammar School (1958‚Äì61) He studied at the University of Queensland, graduating Bachelor of Arts with honours (1965) and a Bachelor of Laws with honours (1967).

Fryberg retired in 2013 after reaching the mandatory retirement age of 70. [2013] Queensland Judicial Scholarship 46. Notable Cases =Brisbane City Council v. Mathews= Brisbane City Council v Mathews, involved an application brought under the Vexatious Proceedings Act as a result of the numerous proceedings brought by the respondent Mathews against the Brisbane City Council (BCC) and other parties. Mathews was a disability pensioner as a result of a head injury he had sustained many years before, and his injuries affected his ability to concentrate for long periods. Justice Fryberg heard the application before all chamber applications in the list that day in order to assist the respondent, who was self-represented, in being able to present his case. After noting that Mathews had brought multiple proceedings, Justice Fryberg found that they were vexatious under the meaning of the Act: > The features of the proceedings to which I have been referred generally are > in my view accurately summarised by [counsel for the applicant]. There is a > joinder of multiple defendants without any basis for joinder; there are > allegations of bias against judges which are completely unsubstantiated (and > I should add that the allegations made orally before me today included > allegations of bias against the lady who is now the Chief Judge of the > District Court and also against the lady who is the Governor); there is the > making of hopeless claims; there are unparticularised allegations of deceit > and fraud; there are exaggerated damages claims; there is non-compliance > with Court proceedings and in particular a failure to deliver complying > pleadings; and finally, there is bringing of claims in respect of which it > is not possible to demonstrate the suffering of any loss.. As a result, Justice Fryberg declared Mathews a vexatious litigant and made an order prohibiting him from commencing any new proceedings against BCC. =Legal Services Commissioner v Quinn= The case of Legal Services Commissioner v Quinn, concerned a Discipline Application brought against a solicitor in the Legal Services Tribunal. The Application followed Quinn‚Äôs guilty plea and conviction for importing child pornography, possessing a child abuse computer game and possessing child abuse photographs in the District Court of Queensland in 2007. The Application was brought by the Legal Services Commission following the convictions. Justice Fryberg‚Äôs judgment was delivered ex tempore and was notably brief, since this was an extremely uncomplicated case for the tribunal. At the hearing, His Honour stated that: > I am satisfied that the respondent was guilty of professional misconduct. I > recommend that the name of the respondent be removed from the local roll... > I order that the respondent pay the applicant's costs of the application > assessed as for a Supreme Court application.. As a result, Quinn‚Äôs entitlement to practice was removed. =R v Bruce Gordon Ward= The accused, a surgeon, was accused of negligently cutting a patient's vein during an operation and prescribing blood-thinning drugs that hastened her death. On 5 March 2009, a hearing took place in order to resolve disclosure issues, as well as when the trial would be held. His Honour rejected the proposed directions submitted by the defence because they would not provide sufficient disclosure to the prosecution of the expert evidence to be presented by the defence. In August 2009, new evidence emerged from nurses, leading to Justice Fryberg suggesting that the case against the accused was not strong enough to likely lead to conviction. The prosecution subsequently dropped the charge, and so Ward was acquitted. =R v Patel= In 2013, Justice Fryberg presided over the retrial of former Bundaberg surgeon Jayant Patel for one of the manslaughter charges, which sat for 22 days and heard from 25 witnesses. Patel was acquitted of the charge by the jury.

The game's hybrid mechanics feature a side perspective, resembling a horizontal shooter, but with Commander Video confined to a set path, called the Vibe (along which he can freely move forward and backward), an element of rail shooters. In addition, the player controls Commander Video's movement independently of his targeting reticule, similar to the style of twin-stick games descended from Robotron: 2084. The reticule is commanded by the Wii Remote's IR pointer, with bullets firing radially from Commander Video's location. Movement along the rail is faster while the player is not holding down the trigger button. The rail takes on various shapes, usually similar to a sine wave, which are predetermined by the stage, while the screen scrolls at a steady rate. Enemies advance from all directions, firing targeted and patterned bullets tradition to shoot 'em ups. The player's performance and interaction with enemies creates musical feedback which contributes to the stage's soundtrack, providing an element similar to certain music games, particularly Rez. The gameplay is less rhythmically constrained than previous entries in the series, providing more freedom to the player, but also less dynamic feedback. Development Reception Bit.Trip Fate received \\"generally favorable reviews\\", according to Metacritic.

It was released for the Wii's WiiWare download service on February 25, 2011, which was later ported to Microsoft Windows and OS X. It was released on the Steam platform on June 5, 2014. Gameplay Bit.Trip Flux plays very similarly to that of the first game in the Bit.Trip series, Bit.Trip Beat. The player must hold the Wii Remote in a sideways position and rotate it towards or away from the screen, or move the mouse forwards and backwards on the Windows and OS X versions, to cause the paddle on-screen to move up or down in an attempt to reflect beats (square blocks moving towards the player's side of the screen). Different types of beats will move from the left side of the screen towards the right. The player must reflect all of them (except for bonus beats and avoid blobs). As the player successfully reflects beats, a bar at the top of the screen will start to fill. When it does, the graphics will change and the player will mode-up to a higher mode and earn more points for each beat. If the player fails to reflect a beat, a bar at the bottom of the screen will start to fill. When it does, the graphics will change and the player will mode-down to a lower mode and earn less points for each beat. Should the player mode-down to the lowest mode, the Nether mode, they must mode-up or they will be sent to the beginning of the last checkpoint. There are 3 main levels to the game: Epiphany, Perception, and Catharsis. At the start, the player can only choose the Epiphany level, and must beat it to unlock Perception. After beating Perception, the player will unlock Catharsis. Each main level is divided into smaller levels that have checkpoints after completing each one. These checkpoints, however, can only be reached in the same play session. If the player quits the game, they will have to start at the beginning of one of the 3 main levels. =Display= The screen is divided into 3 parts. The top part shows the name of the mode the player will be in, which will change (or mode-up) if the bar below the name fills completely. The top bar fills as the player earns points from successfully reflecting beats. In the top right corner, the player's current score is shown. The middle part is the main area of play, where the player's paddle is on the right edge of the screen and beats move from left to right before being reflected back. As the player reflects higher numbers of beats in succession, a number will briefly appear each time to show the count of the chain. The bottom part of the screen shows the name of the mode the player will move down to (or mode- down) if the bar next to it fills completely. The bottom bar fills as the player misses beats or hits avoid blobs. In the bottom right corner is the bonus multiplier that shows how much additional points each beat will add to the player's score. =Key differences from Bit.Trip Beat= While Bit.Trip Beat has the player controlling a paddle on the left edge of the screen with beats coming from the right side of the screen, Bit.Trip Flux instead puts the player's paddle on the right edge of the screen, with beats coming from the left. The colors used for each beat in Bit.Trip Beat give the player a visual clue of what beat type each is, ranging from yellow (normal beat that moves in straight line), orange (beat bounces back toward the player and must be hit multiple times), green (beat fades to transparent and back), and many more. However, in Bit.Trip Flux, the beats are now a uniform white color, regardless of beat type. Bit.Trip Flux adds new avoid blobsBIT.TRIP FLUX , BIT.TRIP website that are more circular in shape (keeping with the pixelated style) that will fill the player's Nether bar (and cause the player to move down a mode). Level progression is also different from Bit.Trip Beat in that the player can reach checkpoints throughout each level. Whereas in Bit.Trip Beat after dying, the player would have to start from the beginning of the level (Transition, Descent, or Growth), Bit.Trip Flux puts the player at the beginning of the last checkpoint they passed, showing ‚ÄúReset‚Äù on-screen as the last checkpoint automatically begins. This feature also means that high scores will not be saved unless the player successfully completes the level. Bit.Trip Beat can be played by up to 4 players simultaneously (with the size of the paddles reduced), whereas Bit.Trip Flux can only be played by up to 2 players simultaneously. The Windows and OS X versions are single player only.

September 18, 893) was a warlord late in the Chinese dynasty Tang Dynasty, who, from 886 and on, controlled an army that initially roved in the lower Yangtze River region and became a key player in the power struggles between various warlords for the control of Huainan (Ê∑ÆÂçó, headquartered in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu) and Zhenhai (ÈéÆÊµ∑, headquartered in modern Zhenjiang, Jiangsu) Circuits. Zhang eventually settled in at Shangyuan (‰∏äÂÖÉ, in modern Nanjing, Jiangsu) in 887 and controlled the area until his death in 893.  Background  Zhang Xiong was originally from Lianshui (Êº£Ê∞¥, in modern Huai'an, Jiangsu), and he served as an officer at Ganhua Circuit (ÊÑüÂåñ, headquartered in modern Xuzhou, Jiangsu), which Lianshui belonged to. Once, when fellow officer Feng Hongduo, who was also from Lianshui, was accused of impropriety by circuit administrators, Zhang spoke on his behalf, and Zhang's doing so caused Ganhua's military governor (Jiedushi) Shi Pu to suspect both of them.New Book of Tang, vol. 190. In 886, knowing that Shi suspected them, Zhang and Feng gathered 300 men and left Ganhua with them, crossing the Yangtze River to attack Su Prefecture (ËòáÂ∑û, in modern Suzhou, Jiangsu), which then belonged to Zhenhai Circuit. They captured it, and Zhang claimed the title of prefect. Eventually, he was able to gather an army reaching the size of 50,000, with 1,000 ships, and called his army Tiancheng Army ().Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 256.  Roving campaigns  Zhang Xiong's occupation of Su Prefecture drew the displeasure and apprehension of Zhenhai's military governor Zhou Bao. As Zhou had heard that Xu Yue (), an officer under Zhou's rival Gao Pian the military governor of Huainan, had a strong army, he induced Xu to attack Su Prefecture, promising to give the prefecture to him if Xu were successful. In summer 887, Xu attacked Zhang; Zhang was unable to withstand the attack, and he took his army east out to the East China Sea.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 257. He sent his officer Zhao Hui () with part of the army and part of the fleet west on the Yangtze to take over Shangyuan, and Zhao was able to do so. Meanwhile, Huainan's capital Yang Prefecture () had become embroiled in internecine warfare, as the officer Bi Shiduo, fearful that Gao's trusted sorcerer L√º Yongzhi was about to kill him, mutinied and captured Yang Prefecture, taking Gao under his control. Zhang used this opportunity to approach it, stopping his army at Dongtang (Êù±Â°ò, in modern Yangzhou), near Yang Prefecture. Subsequently, war again erupted between Bi and his ally Qin Yan the governor (ËßÄÂØü‰Ωø, Guanchashi) of Xuanshe Circuit (ÂÆ£Ê≠ô, headquartered in modern Xuancheng, Anhui) (whom Bi offered the military governorship of Huainan to) and Yang Xingmi the prefect of Lu Prefecture (Âª¨Â∑û, in modern Hefei, Anhui), who put Yang Prefecture under siege. Qin and Bi wanted Zhang's aid, as they were running low on food supplies, and they exchanged the wealths of the city for food supplies from Zhang. However, Zhang's army, after they received the wealths of the city, refused to engage in battle on Qin's and Bi's behalf. Thereafter, Yang Xingmi captured the city, and Qin and Bi fled. They initially tried to join Zhang, but Zhang refused to receive them, and they instead joined forces with Qin Zongheng (), the brother of Qin Zongquan, who had proclaimed himself emperor at Fengguo Circuit (Â•âÂúã, headquartered in modern Zhumadian, Henan). (Qin Zongheng was subsequently assassinated by his lieutenant Sun Ru, who then executed Qin Yan and Bi, defeated Yang Xingmi, and took over Yang Prefecture.) Meanwhile, with Zhou having himself lost control of Zhenhai Circuit in a mutiny, many of Zhou's soldiers fled to Zhao. Zhao thus became arrogant, and he rebuilt Tai Castle (), a major defense mechanism for Jiankang, the ancient capital of the Southern Dynasties, as his residence, and began to live luxuriously. He also stopped communicating with Zhang. When Zhang left Dongtang and advanced west on the Yangtze, Zhao further tried to stop him. In anger, Zhang attacked Shangyuan and captured it. Zhao fled but was killed by his own subordinates. Zhang killed all of Zhao's soldiers who surrendered, and settled in at Shangyuan.  Control of Shangyuan  Meanwhile, Yang Xingmi had returned to Lu Prefecture and was plotting to attack Zhao Huang the governor of Xuanshe (whom Qin Yan had left in charge of Xuanshe when he left to contend for control of Huainan). Yang persuaded Zhang Xiong and Sun Duan () the prefect of He Prefecture (ÂíåÂ∑û, in modern Chaohu, Anhui) to first attack Zhao, forcing Zhao to engage them. While Zhao was able to defeat Zhang and Sun, Yang then himself attacked Zhao and defeated him, eventually capturing his capital Xuan Prefecture () and taking over Xuanshe as its governor. In 890, then-reigning Emperor Zhaozong established a new Sheng Prefecture () at Shangyuan and made Zhang its prefect.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 258. Zhang died in 893, and Feng Hongduo succeeded him as prefect.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 259. It was said that Zhang's soldiers missed him for his leadership skills, and they built a temple to worship him.

He was described in a profile in the Art Journal as \\"one among many artists who have raised themselves by energy and perseverance alone to a good position in their profession and in society\\". By the age of 15 he was earning a living as a portrait painter, and two years later he was working as a theatrical scene-painter, contributing the figures to stage sets at Drury Lane and Covent Garden. He showed two oil paintings on religious subjects at the British Institution in 1837, but dissatisfied with the direction of his work, left for Paris the next year, accompanied by his wife. He stayed there for almost a year, supporting himself by painting miniatures. From 1839 he exhibited at the New Watercolour Society, of which he had become a member before his departure for France. He resigned from the society in 1858 to concentrate on oil painting, and showed several works at the Royal Academy, but returned to it in 1861. In 1843 he was commissioned to produce illustrations for an edition of Isaac Walton's Compleat Angler, and the next year the publisher David Bogue employed him to provide drawings for an edition of the poems of James Beattie and William Collins.

Second World War =Bermuda Volunteer Engineers= Born in Pembroke, Bermuda, the son of Mr. and Mrs. A. J. Gorham, he enlisted in the Bermuda Volunteer Engineers in 1938. The unit was mobilised, along with the other part-time units of the Bermuda Garrison (the Bermuda Militia Artillery (BMA), Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps (BVRC), and the Bermuda Militia Infantry), when the Second World War was declared. As a corporal, he was attached to the signalling division at the Royal Naval Dockyard and earned a commission as a result of his saving an exercise when he suggested an emergency method of signalling visually to replace a broken wireless transmitter. =Bermuda Militia Artillery= Gorham was commissioned as a second lieutenant into the Bermua Militia Artillery on 20 December, 1940, to replace Second Lieutenant Francis J. Gosling, who had trained as a pilot at the Bermuda Flying School and was to depart for the United Kingdom in January for transfer to the Royal Air Force. Gorham would serve only briefly with the unit before following Gosling across the Atlantic. He learnt of an instruction from the Army Council that prevented commanding officers from barring officers under their command from taking any training course for which they volunteered (although his former BVE commanding officer, Major Cecil Montgomery-Moore, DFC ‚Äì having transferred from the BVRC in France to the Royal Flying Corps when he had been commissioned during the First World War, and heading the Bermuda Flying School during the Second World War ‚Äì must undoubtedly have approved of what Gorham intended). =Royal Artillery and Royal Air Force= At the time, the Royal Air Force was having great difficulty in providing effective Air Observation Post pilots to the British Army. In 1918, the British Army lost its air wing when the Royal Flying Corps was merged with the Royal Naval Air Service to create the independent Royal Air Force (RAF). Since then, the RAF had jealously guarded its monopoly on British military and naval aviation. They provided the Royal Navy with RAF aircrew and support personnel to operate the aircraft of the Fleet Air Arm, although the Navy had been allowed to begin training its own aircrew before the war began. The RAF also provided the aircraft and crews that worked in close support roles to the Army, notably the AOP pilots. These were pilots of light aircraft, such as the Auster, who acted as artillery spotters, directing the fire of the guns of the Royal Artillery from the air. Having had poor success at training RAF pilots to direct artillery fire, it was decided to train Army officers who were proficient at the task to pilot aeroplanes. This preceded the recreation of a new air wing within the British Army, the Army Air Corps (which initially included parachute and glider landed units, as well as the Glider Pilot Regiment, but would eventually take over the AOP and other air support roles from the RAF). Then Second Lieutenants Gorham and Hugh Gregg (who had been commissioned into the BMA from the ranks of the BVE on 28 May, 1941) relinquished their BMA commissions on 27 June, 1942, on departing Bermuda for England (via Canada), where they received Regular Army emergency commissions into the Royal Artillery on 8 July, 1942. Trained by the RAF, they served in squadrons controlled by the RAF. Gorham served in North Africa and Italy. In Italy, while in command of B Flight of 655 Squadron, he played the decisive role in the Battle of Monte Cassino when he spotted a German division moving in half- tracked German Armoured Personnel Carriers to counter attack the British 5th Division and the Polish Corps, which were themselves attacking the German- occupied monastery. Contacting the senior Royal Artillery fire control officer on the ground. All two-thousand field guns within range were switched from their local targets and placed under his control. Gorham directed their fire down onto the German Division. The guns fired for hours, with Gorham taking turns with other AOP pilots. The German division was completely destroyed, and the Allied ground forces broke through four days later. For this action, Gorham received the Distinguished Flying Cross, a relative rarity for an Army officer.[Colonel Sir Richard M. Gorham, DFC. Article by Peter Bonete, published in the Mid-Ocean News, 11 March 1972.] =Post-war service= Gorham relinquished his commission as a War Substantive Lieutenant on 13 June 1946, when he was appointed an Honorary Captain.Supplement to the London Gazette, 14 June, 1946, Page 3015 Returning to Bermuda, he found the BMA and the BVRC had been reduced to skeleton commands and the BVE and BMI disbanded in 1946, along with the Home Guard. The BMA and BVRC would both maintain skeleton command structures till their strengths were built back up again in 1951 (they would amalgamate in 1965 into the Bermuda Regiment). Gorham entered the BVRC, renamed the Bermuda Rifles, in which he served for a number of years as Second-in-Command. He was intended to replace Lieutenant-Colonel J.C. Astwood as Commanding Officer in 1954, but was unable to do so due to illness. Major HRG Evans instead took command. Gorham was part of the detachment sent to London for the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953, departing from Bermuda aboard on the 30 April. He retired from the army with the substantive rank of Captain, however he was awarded the Honorary rank of Colonel in the Royal Artillery. =Civil life= In his civil life, Richard Gorham became a prominent businessman and Member of the Parliament of Bermuda (originally titled Member of the Colonial Parliament, or MCP, but today simply Member of Parliament, or MP). He donated much of his wealth to a host of causes, including the Bermuda Maritime Museum, and the Bermuda Sloop Foundation. He was appointed an Ordinary Commanders of the Civil Division of the Most Excellent Order (CBE) in the Queen's New Year Honours on 31 December 1977,Supplement to The London Gazette, 31 December, 1977, Page 18 and a Knight Bachelor in the Queen's New Year Honours on 31 December 1994,Supplement to The London Gazette, 31 December, 1994, Page 2 for public services.

The movement began in late 1946, especially after Direct Action Day in Kolkata and the Noakhali riots, gained significant momentum in April, 1947 and in the end met with success on 20 June 1947 when the legislators from the Hindu majority areas returned their verdict in the favour of Partition.  Background  = Deterioration of law and order = The law and order situation had rapidly deteriorated in Kolkata after the riots. When the Inspector General of Police asked for 50% increase in the Calcutta Armed Police Force, the Prime Minister Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy insisted that the new recruits must all be Punjabi Muslims to which Governor Frederick Burrows readily agreed. To speed up training they must be ex-servicemen. As suitable candidates were not found in Bengal, 600 Punjabi Muslims were recruited from the Punjab. When the new recruits were given preferential treatment by the Muslim League government, the existing Gurkha policemen resented and the former engaged themselves in an armed conflict with the Gurkha policemen. The Muslim police used to enter Bengali Hindu households and molest women. On 12 April, the police entered a Bengali Hindu household in Manicktala and beat up the residents. One, Chhayalata Ghosh, who was pregnant at that time, was severely injured. News spread out that on 14 April another Bengali Hindu housewife was raped by the police. Another such incident which took place on 100, Harrison Road, grabbed the headlines for quite some time. The Calcutta Riot Enquiry Committee observed that the police used to arrest young Bengali Hindu boys, so as to prevent them from appearing before the Committee in order to provide evidence. The Deputy Police Commissioner of Kolkata, Shams-ud-Doha systematically arrested Hindu youths upon identification by one single Muslim. He believed he would teach Hindus a lesson that way. The Muslim League government imposed pre-censorship on news comments criticizing the police excesses. Through a special ordinance, the government imposed penalties on Hindu-owned media like Amrita Bazar Patrika, Hindustan Standard, Anandabazar Patrika and Modern Review and their security deposits confiscated. In certain towns of eastern Bengal, Bengali Hindu girls, in order to defend themselves, began to carry sharp weapons resembling bagh nakh, hidden in their dresses, while going to school. = Mood of the Bengali Hindu people = On 5 March, Kiran Shankar Roy met Fredrick Burrows, the then Governor of Bengal. When the latter asked Roy about the Bengali Hindu opinion on the question of a sovereign united Bengal, Roy summed up that the Bengali Hindu resentment towards the Muslim League government was so high that it was possible that they would build up a passive resistance to the move, refuse to pay taxes to the Muslim League government and set up parallel government of their own. According to Sir Chandulal Tribedi, Hindus in Bengal didn't want an independent Bengal.  Campaign  A caricature in Hindusthan Standard dated 17 May 1947, showing the various demands regarding the Partition of Bengal. Syama Prasad Mookerjee emphasized on the Partition of Bengal, if possible without the partition of India. According to historian Amalendu De, the partition of Bengal was demanded for the first time by the Bengal Provincial Hindu Mahasabha during the Kolkata riots. But according to historian Dinesh Chandra Sinha, the West Bengal Provincial Committee was set up a few months before the Great Calcutta Killings, for the purpose of agitating for the partition of Bengal. Towards the end of 1946, the Bengal Partition League was formed by eminent Bengali Hindu intellectuals as an association for the partition of Bengal. The key people among them were Hemanta Kumar Sarkar, Nalinakshya Sanyal, Major General A. C. Chatterjee, Jadab Panja, Dr. Syama Prasad Mookerjee, Upendranath Banerjee, Dr. Shishir Kumar Banerjee, Subhodh Chandra Mitra and Shailendra Kumar Ghosh. The Bengal Partition League later came to be known as the Bengal Provincial Conference. In February, the Bengal Provincial Hindu Mahasabha constituted a committee for the creation of a separate province for the Hindus of Bengal and began their campaign in the districts. On 29 March, at the annual meeting of the British Indian Association a proposal was passed for the constitution of a homeland for the Bengali Hindus. Maharaja Udaychand Mehtab of Burdwan, P.N.Sinha Ray, Maharaja Srish Chandra Nandy of Cossimbazar, Maharaja Prabendra Mohan Tagore, Maharaja Sitangshukanta Acharya Chaudhuri, Amulyadhan Auddy and Amarendra Narayan Roy were among the eminent persons who supported the move. = Political = Early in February, the Bengal Hindu Sabha constituted a committee for the creation of a separate province for the Hindus of Bengal and began campaigning in the districts. In the first week of April, it convened a three-day-long Bengal Hindu Conference at Tarakeswar, starting on the 4th and attended by over 400 delegates from all over Bengal and over 50,000 people. In his presidential address on the first day of the conference, Nirmal Chandra Chatterjee lauded the successful agitation against Curzon's Partition of Bengal as the most outstanding chapter in the history of Bengal. He said the British had resorted to the partition of the province in order \\"to cripple the greatest nationalist force working for Independence of the country by making the Bengal Hindus minorities in both the provinces\\". The reason for demanding partition now, he explained, was to sustain Bengali Hindu nationalism, carve out a separate homeland for the Bengali Hindu people and constitute it as a province within India, and preserve the Bengali culture and heritage. He further emphasized that it was a question of life or death for the Bengali Hindus. On 5 April, Syama Prasad, in his speech at the Bengal Hindu Conference at Tarakeshwar, suggested the partition of Bengal as the only solution to the communal problem. On the concluding day of the conference, the proposal of the partition was formally raised on behalf of the Bengal Hindu Sabha by Sanat Kumar Raychaudhuri and Surya Kumar Bose. At resolution was passed at the Bengal Hindu Conference at Tarakeswar, authorizing Dr. Syama Prasad Mookerjee to constitute a council of action in order to establish a separate homeland for the Bengali Hindus. It was decided that 100,000 volunteers would be enrolled for the purpose by the end of June. The Constituent Assembly was to be requested to appoint a boundary commission for the partition of the province. On 4 April, the very day the Bengal Hindu Conference was under progress in Tarakeswar, the working committee of the Bengal Congress passed a resolution demanding the partition of Bengal. The meeting was attended by Dr. Syama Prasad Mookerjee, Kshitish Chandra Niyogi, Dr. Bidhan Chandra Roy, Nalini Ranjan Sarkar, Dr. Pramathanath Banerjee, Debendra Lal Khan, Makhanlal Sen and Atul Chandra Gupta among others. After this, the Bengal Hindu Sabha and the Congress intensified their campaigns. No less than 76 Partition meetings were held, of which 59 were convened by the Congress, 12 by the Mahasabha and five jointly. Dr. Syama Prasad Mookerjee further clarified that the movement for the partition of Bengal was not directly related to the partition of India. Even if Pakistan was not created, it was necessary to partition Bengal for the safety of the Bengali Hindu people and their culture. On 22 April, at a public rally in New Delhi, Dr. Syama Prasad Mookerjee declared that even if the Muslim League accepts the Cabinet Mission plan, a separate province needs to be constituted in the Hindu majority areas of Bengal. Syama Prasad Mookerjee called a general strike in Bengal on 23 April demanding against the inclusion of the whole of Bengal into Pakistan. The strike was initially supported by the Communist Party of India. Later the tram workers union, owing affiliation to the CITU planned to defy the strike. When the news reached him, Syama Prasad Mookerjee himself toured the tram depots in person and successfully motivated the tram workers in favour of the strike. The Bengal Provincial Depressed Classes League too supported the partition of Bengal. The BPDCL secretary R. Das clarified that the Jogendranath Mandal's views are not supported by the majority. = Media = According to Dr. Dinesh Chandra Sinha, the Roy's Weekly suggested the division of Bengal to solve the communal problem for the first time. After that Professor Hemanta Kumar Sarkar wrote a series of articles in Dainik Basumati, a Bengali daily, proposing the creation of a separate province of West Bengal. After the Great Calcutta Killings in August, 1946, the correspondence columns of The Statesman and Amrita Bazar Patrika were opened to writers for and against the partition. In December, 1946, Prabasi, a Bengali weekly commented that, chances of reconciliation and co-operation between the two communities are slim. It is time for due consideration of the proposal for partition of Bengal. Sajanikanta Das, the editor of Shanibarer Chithi, a Bengali weekly noted that the Bengali Hindu Homeland Movement was being led by Dr. Syama Prasad Mookerjee, Major General A.C.Chatterjee and Dr. Pramathanath Banerjee, therefore one can be rest assured that they would leave no stone unturned to achieve it. In April, 1947, Sajanikanta Das opined in Shanibarer Chithi that it is in the best of interests to part ways. On 23 April, Amrita Bazar Patrika published an article titled, Homeland for Bengali Hindus where the results of a gallop poll were published. The survey revealed that an overwhelming 98.3% of the Bengali Hindus wanted the partition of Bengal and creation of a separate Bengali Hindu homeland. On 24 April, The Statesman commented that the resentment among the middle class Bengali Hindus towards the Muslim League government was so high that nothing less than Partition would satisfy them. Amrita Bazar Patrika subsequently constituted the Bengal Partition Fund, a public fund for the realization of the Bengali Hindu homeland. = Intellectuals = On 15 March, Syama Prasad Mookerjee convened a meeting in Kolkata, attended by leading intellectuals like Dr. Ramesh Chandra Majumder, Dr. Makhanlal Raychaudhuri, Dr. Suniti Kumar Chattopadhyay, Pandit Ramshankar Tripathi among others. At the meeting Shyama Prasad explained that, from the past experiences it is now clear that Hindus would not be able to live with honour and dignity in Pakistan. Therefore, unless a homeland for the Bengali Hindus is carved out, they would not be able to seek proper rehabilitation. In his speech Dr. Suniti Kumar Chattopadhyay seconded Shyama Prasad's proposal for a separate Bengali Hindu homeland. At the conference it was declared that out of 106 proposals received from the different parts of the province, only six were against the partition of the province, while the overwhelming 94.33% were for creation of homeland for the Bengali Hindu people. On 7 May, eminent Bengali Hindu intellectuals like Dr. Meghnad Saha, Dr. Jadunath Sarkar, Dr. Ramesh Chandra Majumder and Dr. Suniti Kumar Chattopadhyay demanded a separate homeland for the Bengali Hindu people on the ground of security. In May, both the Hindu Mahasabha and Congress jointly convened a mammoth public meeting, presided over by historian Dr. Jadunath Sarkar, to press for Partition. = Judiciary = The jurists of the Kolkata High Court realized the need for a separate homeland for the Bengali Hindus. Otherwise, they felt, the Bengali Hindus would only exchange one form of slavery for another. 50 jurists signed a statement demanding the partition of Bengal.  Lobbying  On 1 April, 11 members of the Constituent Assembly from Bengal submitted a memorandum to the Viceroy, in support of the Partition. On 23 April, Syama Prasad Mookerjee met Viceroy Mountbatten and explained that if the Cabinet Mission plan failed and British India was to be partitioned, then Bengal should also be partitioned. On 26 April, both Kiran Shankar Roy and Dr. Bidhan Chandra Roy assured Dr. Syama Prasad Mookerjee, that they would convince the Congress Working Committee of the need of partition of Bengal. On 3 May, two Scheduled Caste representatives of the Constituent Assembly from eastern Bengal met Viceroy Mountbatten at a party and stated that the Scheduled Castes were determined not to be left under the brutal suppression and domination of Muslims. They firmly demanded the partition of Bengal and suggested that the seven million Scheduled Castes should be relocated in the proposed Bengali Hindu homeland in western Bengal.  Outside support  On 30 April, the meeting of the Chambers of Commerce held at Kolkata lent the support for the Partition of Bengal. According to G.D.Birla, Partition was not only unavoidable, but an excellent way to solve the communal problem. The Muslim owned businesses too wanted Bengal to be partitioned because they wanted to free themselves from the unequal competition with the Tatas and the Birlas.  Aftermath  On 28 June 1947, Frederick Burrows, the Governor of Bengal invited Dr. Prafulla Chandra Ghosh, the leader of the Congress Assembly Party in Bengal to form a cabinet without portfolios and formal administrative powers. The ministers of the cabinet would have the right to access to all the government papers and comment thereupon. They would also have the right to object to any proposal that affected the non-Muslim majority areas of the province. The Bengali Hindu leadership and the press strongly criticized this arrangement as it meant that the Muslim League ministry would still continue hold the office. On 29 June, the Congress and the Muslim League high commands in New Delhi decided that the Muslim League government would continue in Bengal, but with limited powers that would allow them to legislate only for the Muslim-majority districts of eastern Bengal. On the other hand, the Congress Assembly Party in Bengal would nominate a shadow cabinet to administer the Hindu-majority districts of western Bengal. Accordingly, on 2 July, Dr. Prafulla Chandra Ghosh announced an eleven-member cabinet with portfolios. The cabinet included Scheduled Caste members Hem Chandra Naskar, in charge of Agriculture, Forest & Fisheries and Radhanath Das, in charge of Civil Supplies.

The origin of the Diablada is a matter of dispute between the countries of Bolivia and Peru. Three main locations exist for the possible origin of the dance. These places are: *Oruro, Bolivia: Its earliest record found in pre-Hispanic times, the dance of \\"Llama llama\\"in worship of the Uru god Tiw, dance subsequent ironically devoted Aymara language of the Urus dance dressed as devils, as recorded by Ludovico Bertonio. Ethnohistorical development process of disguise and the dance of Diablada fall into three periods, according to the document sent of Carnaval de Oruro to Organization of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (Unesco) proclaimed as one of the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity: Periods of 1606 to 1789, 1789 to 1944 y 1944 to 1960. *Juli, Peru: The Diablada would have been introduced in 1576 to the native Lupakas people of Juli, located near Lake Titicaca in the Altiplano of present-day Puno, Peru; and from there it allegedly spread to other parts of the Spanish domain in the Americas. Origin of the denomination The name was consolidated in a historical process of acceptance of the \\"Dance of devils\\" Native-Miners to the whole society of Oruro, this process covers the period from 1789 to 1944 where groups of \\"parades of devils\\" be called \\"Diablada.\\" Finally in 1904 created the primeval \\"Diablada\\" with the label \\"The Great Traditional Authentic Diablada Oruro\\", with music, dress, choreography and plot defined. This period culminated with the founding of new groups of Diabladas in 1944, consolidating the denomination. Currently this definition is in the dictionary of the Spanish Royal Academy of Language. Origin of the dance Wari, Urus god who survived the onslaught of Aymara, Quechua and Spanish, is the \\"Uncle of mine\\" (Tiw), the last incarnation of the old Wari in Oruro, Bolivia200px Its earliest record found in pre-Hispanic times, the dance of \\"Llama llama\\" dance subsequent ironically devoted Aymara language of the Urus dance dressed as devils, as recorded by Ludovico Bertonio. With the arrival of the Spanish in this region in 1535 and the Augustinians in 1559 with the Virgin of Candelaria, it begins to produce an acculturation of religions and cultures. Ethnohistorical development process of disguise and the dance of Diablada fall into three periods, according to the document sent of Carnaval de Oruro to Organization of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (Unesco). *1606 to 1789: Historical period the founding of the Villa de San Felipe de Austria by Mr. Manuel de Castro Castillo and Padilla in a space called Uru Uru (Hururu now Oruro), which survives in part the cult of Imps ( name called) to \\"uncle\\" of mine that is slowly becoming a cult mixed to \\"Virgin of Socav√≥n (Virgin of Candelaria) - Uncle of mine (Wari).\\" *1789 to 1944: Officially the image of the Virgin would be enthroned as from the date his image venerated by miners would be dressed as devils, including the archangel San Miguel. By 1818 the cure Montealegre Unveils \\"The Story of the Diablada\\", in 1891 finally ends the construction of the chapel of the Tunnel. And by 1904 was born the primeval \\"Diablada\\" with the tagline of \\"The Great Traditional Authentic Diablada Oruro.\\" Diablada starting to travel inside and outside the country since 1915 to show its spectacular choreography, music and costume. *1944 to 1960: During this period Diabladas form new groups in 1944 such as: Artistic and cultural fraternity the \\"Diablada\\", in June of that year the Traditional set Folk \\"Diablada Oruro\\" then the \\"Circle of Arts and Letters.\\" In 1956 he founded the \\"Diablada Railway\\" and finally in 1960 the \\"Artistic Diablada Urus\\". Diabladas also travel inside and outside the country showing the rich culture of Oruro, resulting in the founding of similar groups in other geographies of the continent. Native American roots Oruro Carnival in Bolivia. The debate about the patrimonial identity of the Diablada concerns its roots as well. Chilean and Peruvian organizations suggest that since this dance is inspired in the Andean civilizations previous to the formation of the current national borders, it should belong equally to the three nations and other Andean states such as Argentina and Ecuador as well. Bolivian cultural organizations and government label this as an \\"unlawful cultural heritage appropriation\\" and consider that the declaration of the Carnaval de Oruro as one of the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity gives Bolivia and the city of Oruro support on this claim. Bolivian scholars such as the professor of ethnomusicology and cultural heritage, Diego Echevers T√≥rrez, express that the Diablada is not the mere representation of the devils in a defined space, but constitutes the cultural heritage of the city of Oruro with specific actors and environment.Echevers T√≥rrez 2009 =Aymaran roots theory= The scholars who defend the theory of Juli (Peru) identify the roots of this dance with the Aymaran traditions of the Lupakas. Based on the written accounts of 16th-century historian and writer Inca Garcilaso de la Vega, the Lupaka natives of Juli in the year 1576 presented their version of the Autos Sacramentales taught to them by Spanish Jesuit priests. According to the director of the cultural group Yuyachkani of Peru, Miguel Rubio Zapata, the dance holds Native American roots from the cult of Anchanchu, a pre-Hispanic Aymara deity. Furthermore, rearchers Peter McFarren, Sixto Choque, and Teresa Gisbert state that the Diablada has roots to the Aymaran narrative of the Myth of the Supaya. =Uru roots theory= Depiction of the party of the Collasuyus during the Ito festival presented in the 17th century book Primer Nueva Cor√≥nica y Buen Gobierno of Felipe Guam√°n Poma de Ayala. After the declaration of the Carnaval de Oruro as one of the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity on 18 May 2001, the UNESCO delegated their ex-ambassador in Bolivia, Iv√©s de la Goublaye de Menorval, the task to be the moderator of the project and handed a form to the Bolivian authorities to be filled in coordination with historians and folklorists, such as Ramiro Condarco Morales, Mario Monta√±o Arag√≥n, Fernando Caj√≠as, Alberto Guerra Guti√©rrez, Javier Romero, El√≠as Delgado, Carlos Condarco Santill√°n, Marcelo Lara, Zenobio Calizaya, Zulma Yugar, Walter Zambrana and Ascanio Nava. The document elaborated by this group is based in the theory that the modern Diablada has roots in the ancient rituals performed 2000 years ago by the Uru civilization. The study makes reference to a deity named Tiw who was the protector of the Urus in mines, lakes and rivers and, in the case of Oruro (or Uru-uru), the owner of caves and rocky shelters. The Urus worship this deity with the dance of the devils being the Tiw himself the main character, later this name was Hispanicized as T√≠o (), and as product of the syncretism, the Tiw represented the figure of the devil regretting and becoming devotee of the Virgin of Socav√≥n.A.C.F.O. 2001, p.3. During the times of the Tahuantinsuyu, the four administrative entities known as suyus had their own representative dances during the Ito festival, a festivity once celebrated throughout the entire empire but, according to the historian Jos√© Mansilla V√°zquez, who based on manuscripts of Fray Mart√≠n de Mur√∫a, says that these festivities were outlawed during the Viceroyalty of Peru with the exception of Oruro which, for being considered an important miner city in the 16th century, counted with some privileges and the Spanish authorities looked to the other way allowing this festivity persist in this city, adapting itself later into the Spanish traditions between the Carnestolendas and the Corpus Christi becoming into the Carnaval of Oruro over the centuries.A.C.F.O. 2001, pp.10-17. Map of the sacred places in the city of Oruro, Bolivia showing the location of the ants, lizards, toads and snakes, animals considered sacred in the Uru mythology. The ancient authors, Fray Mart√≠n de Mur√∫a and Felipe Guaman Poma de Ayala make reference in their works to the different dances of the area, including the dance of the Llama llama, name given by the Aymaras to refer to the Urus dressed as dancing demons, as it was recorded by Ludovico Bertonio. This dance was performed during the Ito festivities by the representatives of the region known as Urucolla, a sub-region of the south- eastern suyu of Collasuyu located in the lake system of the Department of Oruro between the basins of the lakes Poop√≥ and Coipasa, where the Uru civilization had the city of Oruro as their main social centre, becoming together with Nazca and Wari one of the most ancient cities in the Andean world.Guaman Poma de Ayala 1615, p.235. The supporters of this theory consider that the Uru mythology is reflected in the symbolism of the Diablada. The legend behind the importance of the city of Oruro as an ancient sacred place for the Urus tells the story of the chthonic deity Wari, which in the Uru language means soul (). He, after hearing that the Urus were worshiping Pachacamaj, represented by Inti, unleashed his revenge by sending plagues of ants, lizards, toads and snakes, animals considered sacred in the Uru mythology. But they were protected by the √ëusta who adopted the figure of a condor, defeating the creatures petrifying them and becoming sacred hills in the four cardinal points of the city of Oruro; these animals are also often represented in the traditional masks of the Diablada. Spanish influence One of the most referenced studies about the Diablada is the 1961 book of Julia Elena Fort√∫n, La danza de los diablos (The dance of the devils), in which the theory of a relationship between this dance and a Catalan dance named Ball de diables, was suggested; more specifically with the elements used in the localities of Pened√®s and Tarragona.Fort√∫n 1961, p. 23.Rius I Mercade 2005 Julia Elena Fort√∫n, unlike other historians in the Peruvian side, disagrees with the idea of considering the Diablada as a product of the introduction of the autos sacramentales in the Andes, because among the ones studied by her, the thematic of the devil and his temptations was not contemplated.Fort√∫n 1961, p. 24. =Autos sacramentales Theory= 18th-century painting of the Danza de los diablicos de T√∫cume. In 2003, the newspaper Correo and Jos√© Morales Serruto, coordinator of cultural activities of the Asociaci√≥n Nativa Puno (Native Association Puno), suggested that the dance of the Diablada was originated in the Peruvian city of Juli during a representation of the autos sacramentales in the year 1576 to the Aymaran kingdom of the Lupacas. Historian Mercedes Serna observes that as soon as the Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire was achieved, there was a sudden increase in the amount of Autos Sacramentales presented in the Spanish colonies. Jose Miguel Oviedo records that by the year 1560 contests were held for religious theatrical presentations. This representation was documented in the 17th century book Comentarios Reales of Inca Garcilaso de la Vega where it reads: Garcilaso de la Vega further mentions that the Jesuit priests taught the Auto Sacramental comedy by writing it in Aymara, and the natives of Juli later presented their version of the religious dance to the priests and, later, presented a dialogue to the rest of the Spanish population in such a way that it ‚Äúchanged the opinion that up to that point had regarded the natives as being dumb, rude, or incapable.‚Äù This same information is used by other authors, such as the Peruvian scholar Nicomedes Santa Cruz and the Bolivian anthropologist Freddy Arancibia Andrade, to suggest that the Spanish influence was spread to Oruro from the southern Bolivian region of Potos√≠. Andrade considers that the Diablada recovers the steps of rebellion and combat of the ritual of Tinku mixed with the biblic vision introduced by the Spanish conquerors in the miner region of Aullagas starting in the year 1538.Santa Cruz, 2004, p. 285. Another piece of information collected by Andrade is that in 1780 the army of Tom√°s Katari wore demon suits to attack the towns of Macha, Pocoata, Colquechaca, Aullagas and San Pedro de Buena Vista, giving more strength to the syncretism and represents the appearance of the tinku- devil. After the silver era in Bolivia, the miners went to Unc√≠a to work for the tin company of Sim√≥n Iturri Pati√±o and during the Bolivian federal war, the miners migrated to Oruro where in 1904 they were allowed to dance for the Virgin of Socav√≥n. =Ball de diables theory= Ball de diables during a Correfoc in Catalonia, Spain. The Ball de diables has origins in a 12th- century entrem√©s representing the struggle between the good and the evil where the figure of the archangel Saint Michael and his angels battled the forces of evil represented by Lucifer and his demons. This act was performed in the wedding banquet of the Barcelona count, Ram√≥n Berenguer IV with the princess Petronila, daughter of the king of Arag√≥n and Catalonia in the year 1150. In a study presented in 2005 by the Catalan scholar Jordi Rius i Mercade, member of the Ball de Sant Miquel i Diables de la Riera (board of the Ball de diables in Spain) and editor in chief of the specialized magazine El Dragabales during the Symposium of the Catalan Discovery of America, states that the traditional dances and short plays performed during the celebration of Corpus Christi in Spain were adopted by the Christian church to teach their doctrines to the Native Americans; their festivities were readapted to the new calendar and their deities were redefined acquiring demoniac forms representing the evil fighting against the divine power. According to Rius i Mercade, the Ball de diables was the most suitable for this purpose. In this study, he identifies three Latin American dances that contain similar elements to the Catalan Ball de diables; the Diablada of Oruro, Baile de Diablos de Cob√°n in Guatemala and Danza de los diablicos de T√∫cume in Peru. The Diablada of Oruro represents the tale of the struggle between the archangel Saint Michael and Lucifer, the she- devil China Supay and devils accompanying them. Ruis i Mercade suggests that this was a tale presented by the parish priest Ladislao Montealegre of the city of Oruro in 1818 inspired in the Catalan Ball de diables. Colonial history During the colonial times in the region, from the 15th century till the first half of the 19th century, the ancient Andean beliefs were blended with the new Christian traditions. The traditions adopted new iconography and the celebrations adopted a new meaning during the Latin American wars of independence. =From the worship of the Sun to the Virgin of Candlemas= The church of Copacabana, Bolivia where the Virgin of the Candlemas was selected as patroness of the city and her cult spread across the region. With the advent of the Inca state religion the inhabitants of the Island of the Sun () were replaced by ministers in worship of the sun (Inti) and the city of Copacabana located in the Bolivian side of the Lake Titicaca had been repopulated by forty-two different nations of mitimaes and became one of the most important landmarks for the constant pilgrimage to the sanctuary; with the migration, two social classes were created in this area, the newcomers became Anansaya (upper) and the indigenous people Urinsaya (lower).Salles- Reese 1997, pp. 166-167. The selection of the Virgin of the Candlemas as the patroness of Copacabana was a sign of the power structures established by the Incas in the area. In the year 1582 a frost threatened to destroy the crops, and the inhabitants decided to build an altar to a Christian figure, but there was a dispute because the Anansayas insisted to use the Virgin of the Candlemas since Francisco Tito Yupanqui had already sculpted her image while the Urinsayas wanted it use the image of Saint Bartholomew instead. But the Anansayas' wishes were imposed in the enthronement of the Virgin of Copacabana and the foundation of a brotherhood. =Independence and the transition to the Carnival= Different models of Diablada masks in an exhibition in the British Museum. The cult of the Virgin of the Candlemas, was then spread throughout the Andes reaching, Oruro and to the west to Puno. In Oruro there is a Sanctuary in honour of the Virgin of Socav√≥n (or Sanctuary of the Virgin of the Mineshaft) who was originally the Virgin of Candlemas traditionally honoured on 2 February, like in Puno, but later the date was moved to Carnival; this transition is product of the Bolivian War of Independence. Harris 2003, pp. 205-211. There is a legend that says that on the Saturday of Carnival in 1789 a bandit known as Nina-Nina or Chiru-Chiru was mortally wounded in a street fight and before dying he was confronted by the Virgin of the Candlemas. Some versions state that he used to worship a life-size image of the Virgin painted in a wall of a deserted house, some say that the painting miraculously appeared on the wall of the bandit's own house after his death. And the legend is concluded with the tale of the troupe of devils dancing in honour of the Virgin in the next year's Carnival. The present sanctuary in Oruro was completed in 1891. However, according to the Ph D in religious studies and Executive Director of the Wisconsin Humanities Council at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Max Harris, this legend is related to a historical reality. During the Rebellion of T√∫pac Amaru II, which started in Cusco and spread along the Andean highlands, Oruro experienced a brief but bloody revolution as well. Pushed by the fear of being target of the indigenous revolution, the majority Creole on the night of Saturday, 10 February 1781, attacked the minority ruling class of the peninsular-born Spaniards () . With the arrival of the Indigenous army the Creoles made an alliance. On 15 February, a messenger arrived in Oruro with orders from T√∫pac Amaru II. He instructed his army to respect churches and clergy, to do no harm to Creoles, and to prosecute none but chapetones. And assured the victory by entering in La Paz \\"by Carnival (por Carnestolendas)\\", the Indigenous occupation of Oruro started to retreat leaving several thousands of deaths. But during March and April they launched more attacks to the city this time against the Creoles and the remaining Spaniards who unified forces to repel them. Harris observes that the Carnival of the year of 1781, fell on 24 February, placing Oruro's occupation exactly halfway between Candlemas and Carnival, making the situation in Oruro in Harris' words, \\"carnivalesque\\". Religious processions duelled with secular parades. Europeans and Creoles disguised as Indigenous, cases like a Spaniard resorting to cross-dressing tin a vain attempt to save his life and thousands of armed men in the streets of the colonial city. By 19 February people in the city regardless of the conflict continued celebrating and, throughout Carnival, the city markets were full of robbers selling the looted gold and silver back to its owners or to cholos and mestizos. By 1784 it was customary to rejoice, dance, play, and form comparsas (companies of masqueraders) for the Carnival in Oruro. Harris considers that with this background is that the legend of the Virgin of the Mineshaft in 1789 appeared favouring the rebellion as they worshiped the Virgin of Candlemas while the chapetones used to worship the Virgin of the Rosary. Under the beliefs of the revolutionaries, the Virgin of the Socav√≥n tolerated the indigenous deities or devils and, according to Harris, if the legend is correct, by 1790, Oruro's miners had moved Candlemas to Carnival and added indigenous gods, masked as Christian devils, to the festivities. In 1818, Oruro's parish priest, Ladislao Montealegre, wrote the play Narrative of the seven deadly sins, where according to Harris and Fort√∫n, borrowed elements of the Catalan Ball de diables like the female devil, Diablesa in the Catalan dance and China supay in the Diablada and where the Devil leads the Seven Deadly Sins into battle against the opposing Virtues and an angel. Harris suggests that Montealegre may have wanted to represent the threat of rebellion and the historical context with this play. A generation later, in 1825 after Bolivia achieved its independence, the Diablada and the Carnival adopted a new meaning for Oruro's residents. Two of the Diablada dance squads and the street from where the parade starts are named after Sebastian Pagador, one of the Creole heroes of the uprising. And the main square which is in the route of the Carnival to the Virgin of the Mineshaft temple is named Plaza 10 de febrero (10 February square) remembering the date of the uprising.

Published in October 2000 by St. Martin's Press, it covers the March 9, 1997 murder of the Notorious B.I.G. in a drive-by shooting. Background The book includes a chapter about accusations from fellow rapper Tupac Shakur, that Biggie, 24, and his producer, Sean \\"Diddy\\" Combs, were responsible for Tupac being injured during a 1994 shooting at New York City's Quad Studios, where Biggie was recording that same night. Smalls denied the accusation, as did Combs, and no arrests were ever made in the case. In September 1996, Shakur, 25, was shot a second time, this time in Las Vegas. Shakur died six days later. That murder, too, remains unsolved, which Scott covered in The Killing of Tupac Shakur. In what was promoted as a Sunday series with \\"exclusive information\\" in the Los Angeles Times, the article quoted a single source saying Biggie Smalls had been in Las Vegas the night Shakur was murdered and that Smalls had paid for and ordered the hit against Shakur. When Voletta Wallace, Smalls' mother, gave proof to the Times that her son had, in fact, been in a New York studio recording music the night Shakur was shot, the newspaper retracted the story and ultimately removed it from its website. Scott commented on the article in a Las Vegas CityLife column. \\"Wallace was a rapper, not a killer,\\" she wrote. \\"He was an only child who attended private Catholic school and was raised by an over-protective single mom. While Wallace spewed violence in his songs, he wasn't a street thug like Shakur.\\"Las Vegas CityLife, \\"Death in Vegas: The Times claim that B.I.G. arranged the killing of Tupac Shakur simply doesn't make sense,\\" by Cathy Scott, September, 17 2002 People magazine interviewed Scott about the claim, quoting her as saying, \\"It's easy to point a finger at a dead guy.

In this role, either the pilot of the aircraft or another crew member acts as an observer watching for targets on the ground, and/or as a Forward Observation Officer directing the fire, by radio, of artillery on the ground (or calling in tactical ground-attack aircraft).History of AOP at forcesreunited.org.uk Background In the interwar period, the role of artillery spotting was mixed with reconnaissance and ground attack to be served by Army Co-operation (AC) squadrons. At the beginning of World War II their standard aircraft was the Westland Lysander. This aircraft had a high level of losses with the British Expeditionary Force during the Battle of France (118 shot down out of a total of 175 deployed). This demonstrated the unsuitability of the Lysander for Army Co-operation and called into question the whole concept. These RAF squadrons converted to fighter-bomber aircraft by 1941, dropping the liaison and artillery spotting roles. World War II - British development The first of the dedicated Air Observation Post units was established by Major Charles Bazeley of the Royal Artillery. Working as D flight of an RAF unit and equipped with the Auster, they went to France in February 1940 to develop the role on the French artillery ranges, in liaison with the French army. This training and development work had to be abandoned when the German blitzkrieg got underway and the unit was back at its UK base in Old Sarum by 20 May 1940. The flight had been ordered to disband, but the Army resisted this, and the intervention of General Alan Brook, who was Commander in Chief Home Forces at the time, was able to secure the future of the flight and the concept of the AOP. By 1942, AOP squadrons 651, 652, and 653 were in existence. Ultimately the AOP units consisted of squadrons 651 to 663, with 664, 665 and 666 as RCAF units with both Canadian and British personnel. The key difference from the Army Co-operation squadrons was that AOP pilots were from the Royal Artillery. The RAF provided the technicians to service the aircraft and the equipment officers and adjutants. The rest of each unit was provided by the army, including signalers and drivers. A further unusual feature of Air Observation Post squadrons was that all pilots were officers, and they were nearly all captains. Since most operations were carried out separately by individual flights, this lack of rank structure in squadrons tended not to produce problems. During World War II, British AOP units used light, fixed-wing aircraft, almost exclusively several marks of Auster aircraft. The low speed, high manoeuvrability, small size (so aiding concealment at front-line landing grounds) and light weight of the Auster made this a much more suitable aircraft than the Lysander. The standard tactic of dealing with enemy fighter aircraft was to fly very low around a hill or a wood. Casualty rates for AOP pilots turned out to be relatively low, certainly compared to RAF pilots or infantrymen. One source of losses in combat was the aircraft being hit whilst flying through the path of outgoing shells. This was a particular hazard in intense bombardments: four aircraft were lost in this way during the crossing of the Rhine in March 1945. Postwar In 1957, the newly formed Army Air Corps was created from existing army units. Fixed wing aircraft were steadily replaced by helicopters.

Biography  His family originally came from Burgundy. They were forced to flee after Pierre Vezin (1654‚Äì1727) gave assistance to the Huguenots, even though he was a Catholic. For two generations, they lived in Hannover. In 1813, Charles Henri Vezin (1782‚Äì1853) emigrated to the United States and settled in Philadelphia. The family produced several creative artists in addition to Frederick, including his uncle, the actor Hermann Vezin, and his brother, Charles Vezin (1858‚Äì1942), also a painter. In 1876, Frederick decided to return to Germany to study art at the Kunstakademie D√ºsseldorf, where he studied landscape painting with Georg Heinrich Crola. Later, he studied history painting with Peter Janssen and the Nazarene artist, Karl M√ºller. He remained at the Academy until 1883; working with Julius Roeting, Eduard von Gebhardt and Wilhelm Sohn. After a stay in Munich, he lived in D√ºsseldorf from 1895 until his death. He concentrated on landscapes and genre scenes, mostly depicting high society, although he was also known for portraits. Thanks to the influence of his uncle, Hermann, he was known in England and the United States as well. He had a major showing at the Philadelphia Academy of Fine Arts in 1893. Stylistically, he combines elements of the D√ºsseldorf School and Impressionism.

He was the first head coach of the Michigan Wolverines men's ice hockey team, holding the position from 1922 to 1927. He was later employed as a medical doctor and surgeon in the Chicago area.

His father, John Howard Barss (born Wolfville, Nova Scotia) was ordained in July 1891 and traveled to India as a Baptist missionary. In 1893, while still an infant, Barss returned to Canada with his parents. He traveled with his parents from Liverpool, England, arriving in New York on October 30, 1893.Ancestry.com.

They returned to their home in Wolfville, Nova Scotia, where Barss' father operated a grocery store and served as a Baptist minister. Barss was enrolled at Acadia University in Wolfville, receiving his degree in 1912. After graduating from Acadia, Barss played professional hockey for the Montreal Wanderers of the National Hockey Association.Bacon 2001 at 19-20. World War I Barss in World War I uniform posing with his parents. In April 1915, Barss entered the Canadian Over-Seas Expeditionary Force following the outbreak of World War I. At that time, he listed his occupation as clerk and indicated that he had three years of prior military service. In his history of the University of Michigan's hockey program, author John U. Bacon provides a lengthy account of Barss' war-time service and its impact on his decision to become a medical doctor. According to Bacon, Barss was wounded by shrapnel and gassed at the Second Battle of Ypres in April and May 1915.Bacon 2001 at 20-25. However, Barss' military records indicate that Barss' Attestation Paper for the Canadian Over-Seas Expeditionary Force was completed on April 30, 1915 in Montreal. Accordingly, it appears that Barss likely did not see combat action at the Second Battle of Ypres. Barss' Service Record states that he was wounded on June 2, 1916. He was a machine gunner sergeant with the P.P.C.L.I and badly wounded in Sanctuary Wood during the first day of the Battle of Mt. Sorrel on the eastern border of Ypres, Belgium. According to Bacon, Barss suffered permanent lung damage and a severe abdominal injury from shrapnel while serving in Belgium. After a lengthy hospitalization in France, Barss was sent to Camp Hill Hospital in Halifax, Nova Scotia in November 1917. Barss arrived in Halifax weeks before the Halifax Explosion, an explosion of a ship in Halifax harbor loaded with 10 tons of gunpowder, 35 tons of airplane fuel and 200 tons of TNT. More than 1,700 people were killed in the explosion. Barss was not injured and helped tend to the injured in the aftermath of the disaster. University of Michigan In 1919, Barss enrolled at the University of Michigan as a graduate student in bacteriology. In 1920, he enrolled at the Medical School,(Barss was a second year student) receiving a medical degree from the university in 1924. While attending medical school at Michigan, Barss also served as the first coach of the Michigan Wolverines men's ice hockey team. According to Wilfred Byron Shaw's four-volume history of the University of Michigan, hockey had its beginning at Michigan in 1921 with Barss as the coach.(\\"Hockey also had its beginning in 1921, with Richard Barss [sic] as Coach (1921-26). Although officially not on the Western Conference athletic program, hockey provided a number of Big Ten teams with competition.\\") Other sources indicate that Barss became the coach of the Michigan hockey team in 1922. According to Bacon, Barss officiated many of the games for the 1922 team and then asked athletic director Fielding H. Yost if he could start a varsity hockey team. Bacon wrote that Yost \\"might not have known much about hockey, but he knew a natural coach when he met one\\" and accepted Barss' offer.Bacon 2001 at 28. It was not until 1923 that the Michigan hockey team received formal recognition as a varsity sport. The first \\"official\\" college hockey game played west of the Alleghenies was a game between Michigan and Wisconsin, played on January 12, 1923, in Ann Arbor, Michigan.Bacon 2001 at 29-31. The game went into overtime with Michigan prevailing by a score of 2-1. Barss coached the Michigan Wolverines men's ice hockey team during its first five years as a formal varsity sport. During those five years (1923 to 1927), the Michigan hockey team compiled a record of 26-21-4. As the popularity of college hockey grew in the early 1920s, other colleges looked to Barss' pupils for coaching candidates. In January 1923, former Michigan hockey star Russell Barkell was hired as the coach of the hockey team at Williams College. In February 1924, after a 3-0 victory by Michigan over Wisconsin, a Madison newspaper praised the defensive play of the Barss-coached Wolverines: \\"With an almost air-tight defense and a definite scoring attack the Michigan hockey team defeated the Badger six by a score of 3 to 0 yesterday afternoon. Wisconsin could not stop Michigan's fast team work and was unable to penetrate their defense to take any close shots at the goal.\\" By January 1925, the Michigan ice hockey team had four returning letter men from the prior year's team, and a call for candidates by Coach Barss \\"brought out 20 aspirants.\\" Medical career After retiring as Michigan's hockey coach in 1927, Barss moved to Riverside, Illinois. He worked at the Hines Veteran Hospital in Maywood, Illinois, eventually becoming the chief of surgery there.Bacon 2001 at 37-38. In June 1930, Barss became a naturalized United States citizen.Naturlization record for Joseph Ernest Barss. Ancestry.com.

History Knoxville was settled in the late 18th century, but law enforcement and criminal justice were handled by Knox County in its earliest years. By the early 1800s, Knoxville began to establish its own municipal government services, and Joseph R. Reed was named Town Sergeant in 1802. He was paid $80 per year, and his responsibilities included patrolling the town two nights per week and enforcing the observance of the Sabbath. For the next half a century, policing in Knoxville was informal and often the responsibility of one paid employee and some unpaid night watchmen. In 1857, M. V. Bridwell was named the first chief of police, and paid watchmen (discreetly appointed men referred to as \\"secret police\\") were first utilized in 1867. In 1885, a three-man board of public works was created in Knoxville to give more structured oversight to police officers and other city employees. In 1901, Knoxville officers accosted Harvey Logan (also known as Kid Curry), an outlaw and a member of Butch Cassidy's Wild Bunch who had been suspected in the deaths of several other law enforcement officials. Officers William Dinwiddie and Robert Saylor were wounded in the ensuing shootout. Logan was arrested for the shootings, but he escaped from jail; he fatally shot himself in 1904 while being pursued by a posse. Dinwiddie and Saylor both died in 1914, and both of their deaths were attributed to complications of the 1901 shooting. Organization As of 2018, the Chief of Police is Eve Thomas. The department has four divisions. The Patrol Division contains the majority of the uniformed members. The Criminal Investigations Division is responsible for all criminal and felony investigations within the department. The Management Division oversees human resources, financial, and legal aspects of the department.

Chopra Nagorik Committee A brutal rape case came into light at 2012 at Chopra for the first time in the history of Chopra. People were frightened and people formed the Chopra Nagorik Committee to protest unitedly against any misdeeds at present or in future. Mustaque Alam, an advocate of the High Court at Calcutta and Alok Sarkar, a reporter of AAJKAL Bengali daily founded Chopra Nagorik Committee (CNC). A student of Chopra Girls High School while returning home from school was abducted and raped mercilessly in a tea garden near Kalagach. Mustaque, Alok and Abhijit took out a protest rally against the brutal rape and their mouths were tied with black tags. People from all class joined the rally independently and demanded the arrest and punishment of the accused. The accused was arrested within a week. Mustaque became the founder Secretary and Alok the founder President of Chopra Nagorik Committee. After the rape case the Committee raised its voice for Thetor Majhi, a 75-year-old man living below the poverty line who was not getting old age pension because he was marked as dead in the Government records though he was alive. Chopra Nagorik Committee raised the issue strongly and media also take the issue seriously. He was deprived of all government benefits as he was dead in the eye of law. About 800 more people, according to an investigation report, were deprived likewise. The agitation of Chopra Nagorik Committee helped them to get justice and they again got their life in the government records and started getting their pensions and benefits of other government schemes as well. Besides agitation and protest movements Chopra Nagorik Committee used to perform some programmes every year i.e. felicitate the meritorious students of the block and the people of various field who had done beneficial work for Chopra, giving award to the sera Durga Puja Committees, organizing Legal Aid programs, cultural programs, supplying books to the needy meritorious students, Pradip Kumar Smiriti Swarak Boktrita etc. Chopra Nagorik Committee has such a place in the mind of people of Chopra that whenever any injustice is done to any member of the society, its reported to the members of C.N.C.

They are known for constructing large horizontal sheet webs measuring up to a square metre in larger species. Cambridgea were originally assigned to the Agelenidae by Dalmas in 1917 but were reassigned to the Stiphidiidae in 1973. Most recently, both Cambridgea and sister genus Nanocambridgea were reassigned to the Desidae, subfamily Porteriinae on the basis of molecular evidence.  Description  Cambridgea are medium to large arboreal spiders, with body lengths ranging from approximately 6-10mm in the case of Cambridgea reinga to about 20mm in the case of Cambridgea foliata. They have long legs and porrect chelicerae which are significantly longer in adult males compared to adult females.Forster, R.R.; Wilton, C.L. 1973. The spiders of New Zealand. Part 4, Agelenidae, Stiphidiidae, Amphinectidae, Amaurobiidae, Neolanidae, Ctenidae, Psechridae. Otago Museum Bulletin, 4: p. 148. Male pedipalps are characterised by a cymbium that extends well beyond the bulb and species can be differentiated by the morphology of the male tibial apophyses and female epigyne.Blest, A.D.; Vink, C.J. 2000: New Zealand spiders: Stiphidiidae. Records of the Canterbury Museum, 13(supplement)  Behaviour  = Male-male competition = In the summer, following maturation, adult males depart their natal webs at night and wander in search of receptive females. During this time males will frequently wander into homes, sometimes getting stuck in bathtubs. Having found a female's web, males will defend the web and fight any rival males that subsequently arrive in her web. Fights proceed through clear stages of escalation. In some species males will first signal to each other by creating distortions in the mainsheet by shaking their bodies or by drumming their first pairs of legs and pedipalps on the web. Unless one male withdraws from the web, these contests will escalating in sparring in which males push at each other with their first two pairs of legs. Some fights will escalate further into grappling in which males lock their chelicerae together and push forwards against one another. Fights rarely result in injury. = Web building = Cambridgea are known for building characteristic, three-dimensional sheet webs consisting of a thick, horizontal mainsheet guyed from below with anchoring threads and with a large number of knock-down threads above the mainsheet to intercept flying insects. The \\"rear\\" of the web attaches to a silken retreat which extends a short distance into crevices. The size of webs can vary significantly. Some species build sheet webs with mainsheets of up to one square metre, while some species (e.g. Cambridgea quadromaculata) do not build webs at all. Those Cambridgea that do build webs run along the underside of the mainsheet rather than along the top as some sheet-web spiders do (e.g. Corasoides).

History Historically the western frontier of ancient Pundravardhana kingdom, bordering ancient Anga of Mahabharat fame, the Dinajpur area remained somewhat obscure in the major empires that held sway over the region and beyond till the rise of the Dinajpur Raj during the Mughal period. Some areas later forming a part of Uttar Dinajpur were parts of kingdoms in Nepal. Dinajpur district was constituted by the British in 1786, with a portion of the estate of Dinajpur Raj. Subsequent to the Permanent Settlement in 1793, the semi-independent Dinajpur Raj was further broken down and some of its tracts were transferred to the neighbouring British districts of Purnea, Malda, Rajshahi and Bogra. In 1947, the Radcliffe Line placed the Sadar and Thakurgaon subdivisions of Dinajpur district in East Pakistan. The Balurghat subdivision of Dinajpur district was reconstituted as West Dinajpur district in West Bengal. Raiganj subdivision was formed in 1948. In order to restore territorial links between northern and southern parts of West Bengal which had been snapped during the partition of Bengal, and on the recommendations of the States Reorganisation Commission a portion of the erstwhile Kishanganj subdivision comprising Goalpokhar, Islampur and Chopra thanas (police stations) and parts of Thakurganj thana, along with the adjacent parts of the erstwhile Gopalpur thana in Katihar subdivision were transferred from Purnea district in Bihar to West Bengal in 1956, and were formally incorporated into Raiganj subdivision in West Dinajpur. The township of Kishanganj and its entire municipal boundary remained within Bihar. Islampur subdivision was formed in March 1959. At the same time, the portion of Chopra PS lying to the north of the Mahananda river covering an area that now comprises Bidhannagar-1 gram panchayat, Bidhannagar-2 GP, Chathat-Bansgaon GP and the southern half of Phansidewa-Bansgaon Kismat GP in Darjeeling district, was transferred from West Dinajpur to the jurisdiction of Phansidewa PS in Darjeling district. With the introduction of the Community Development Programme in 1960‚Äì61, community development blocks were set up in West Dinajpur district. In 1992, West Dinajpur district was bifurcated and Uttar Dinajpur district was established. Geography Chakulia is located at . Uttar Dinajpur district has a flat topography and slopes gently from north to south. All rivers flow in that direction. Except for the eastern fringes of Chopra CD Block, most of the district is a part of the catchment area of the Mahanada and also a part of the larger Barind Tract. The soil is composed of different varieties of alluvium. The main rivers are: Nagar, Mahananda, Kulik, Gamari, Chhiramati (Srimati) and Tangon. The rivers have little water in the dry season but with heavy rains, during monsoon, overflow the banks. The Pitana river flows along the eastern boundary of the Goalpokhar II CD Block with Goalpokhar I CD Block. The Sudama and Bolhakuao rivers flow through the CD Block. Goalpokhar II CD Block is bounded by Goalpokhar I CD Block on the north and the east, Karandighi CD Block on the south and Kishanganj CD Block in Kishanganj district of Bihar on the west. Approximately 206 km of the India-Bangladesh border is in Uttar Dinajpur district. It covers the eastern boundary of the district. On the western side Uttar Dinajpur district has 227 km boundary with Bihar. Goalpokhar II CD Block has an area of 298.69 km2.It has 1 panchayat samity, 11 gram panchayats, 174 gram sansads (village councils), 170 mouzas and 169 inhabited villages. Chakulia police station serves this block. Headquarters of this CD Block is at Chakulia. Uttar Dinajpur district is one of the smaller districts in the state and stands 15th in terms of area (3,140.00 km2) in the state. According to the Human Development Report for Uttar Dinajpur district, ‚ÄúGoalpokhar-1, Goalpokhar-2, Karandighi and Islampur blocks in that order stood at the very bottom of the literacy scale in the state. This pooling of illiteracy within Islampur SD also led to the low ranking of Uttar Dinajpur at 494th position out of 595 Indian districts in terms of literacy rates in 2001, despite which its rank had improved considerably in relative terms from the 523rd rank it had occupied in 1991.‚Äù Gram panchayats of Goalpokhar II block/ panchayat samiti are: Belon, Bidyanandapur, Chakulia, Kanki, Nizampur I, Nizampur II, Sahapur I, Sahapur II, Sujapur I, Sujapur II and Toryal Demographics =Population= As per the 2011 Census of India, Goalpokhar II CD Block had a total population of 291,252, all of which were rural. There were 150,125 (52%) males and 141,127 (48%) females. Population below 6 years was 55,345. Scheduled Castes numbered 64,877 (22.28%) and Scheduled Tribes numbered 17,647 (6.06%). As per 2001 census, Goalpokhar II block had a total population of 226,231, out of which 116,659 were males and 109,572 were females. Goalpokhar II block registered a population growth of 34.33 per cent during the 1991-2001 decade. Decadal growth for the district was 28.72 per cent. Large villages (with 4,000+ population) in Goalpokhar II CD Block were (2011 population in brackets): Baldiabasa (4,952), Uttar Shahapur (11,501), Belan (4,054), Kahata (5,358), Sathaur (5,645), Manora (4,117), Nizampur (5,755), Fashia Diation (7,946), Sarjapur (4,911), Amalbari (4,140), Baligora (4,507), Godasamal (4,507), Dakshin Makhanpokhar (4,052) and Kabutarkhopi (8,393). Other villages in Goalpokhar II CD Block included (2011 population in brackets): Bidyanandapur (1,363), Kanki (1,587) and Tarial (1,625). Decadal Population Growth Rate (%) Note: The CD Block data for 1971‚Äì1981, 1981-1991 and 1991-2001 is for Goalpokhar PS covering both Goalpokhar I and Goalpokar II blocks The decadal growth of population in Goalpokhar II CD Block in 2001-2011 was 28.60%. The decadal growth of population in Goalpokhar PS in 1991-2001 was 30.19%, in 1981-91 was 27.06% and in 1971-81 was 33.39%. The decadal growth rate of population in Uttar Dinajpur district was as follows: 30.2% in 1971‚Äì81, 34.0% in 1981‚Äì91, 28.7% in 1991-2001 and 23.2% in 2001‚Äì11. The decadal growth rate for West Bengal was 13.93% in 2001‚Äì2011, 17.77% in 1991‚Äì2001. 24.73% in 1981-1991 and 23.17% in 1971‚Äì1981. Uttar Dinajpur district has the highest decadal population growth rate in West Bengal with a figure of 23.2% for the decade 2001-2011 and is much higher than the state average of 13.8%. According to the Human Development Report for Uttar Dinajpur district, population growth in the area that later became Uttar Dinajpur district was low in the pre-independence era and started picking up with the waves of East Bengali refugees coming in from erstwhile East Pakistan. Despite the formation of an international border in 1947, none of the PS areas in the area which later formed Islampur SD showed much increase in settlement density between 1941‚Äì51, and accelerated settlement only came into evidence in this region after 1961, following their transfer from Bihar to West Bengal. Thus, as population growth in the Uttar Dinajpur region accelerated considerably under the impetus of partition migration after 1951, the Islampur SD areas offered additional living space, easing the overall migration pressure on the region. The Human Development Report analyses, ‚ÄúA spurt in population growth rates first became evident between 1951-1961, and was further magnified between 1971-81 after the creation of Bangladesh when population growth in most districts bordering the Bangladesh-West Bengal frontier showed similar escalation. However, after 1981, when population growth in most other West Bengal districts had tapered off, growth rates in Uttar Dinajpur again showed a fresh spurt. Thus, no deceleration in population growth rates occurred in the district until after 1991‚Ä¶ In addition to Hindu and tribal migrants from across the international border, a sizeable number of migrant Muslims have also settled in the district, mainly driven by economic reasons‚Ä¶ migrants from other states comprised 23% of the total migrants residing in Uttar Dinajpur.‚Äù The large number of migrants from other states is mainly from the neighbouring areas in Bihar. A study by North Bengal University has obesrved that ‚ÄúImmigrants from East Pakistan/Bangladesh have arrived in Uttar Dinajpur in almost equal numbers before and after 1971.‚Äù The Human Development Report opines, ‚ÄúThe overall post-Partition impact on the rates of demographic growth has been particularly strong in all North Bengal districts. Despite its smaller relative size, the region has received more migration in pro rata terms than the West Bengal districts lying south of the Ganga.‚Äù =Literacy= As per the 2011 census, the total number of literates in Goalpokhar II CD Block was 108,675 (46.07% of the population over 6 years) out of which males numbered 63,920 (52.46% of the male population over 6 years) and females numbered 44,775 (39.24% of the female population over 6 years). The gender disparity (the difference between female and male literacy rates) was 13.22%. The literacy rate in Uttar Dinajpur district at 60.13% in 2011, up from 47.89% in 2001, was the lowest amongst all districts of West Bengal. The highest literacy rate amongst the districts of West Bengal was that of Purba Medinipur district at 87.66% in 2011. According to the Human Development Report for Uttar Dinajpur district, ‚ÄúGoalpokhar-1, Goalpokhar-2, Karandighi and Islampur blocks in that order stood at the very bottom of the literacy scale in the state. This pooling of illiteracy within Islampur SD also led to the low ranking of Uttar Dinajpur at 494th position out of 595 Indian districts in terms of literacy rates in 2001, despite which its rank had improved considerably in relative terms from the 523rd rank it had occupied in 1991.‚Äù The five blocks transferred from the state of Bihar to form a new subdivision in West Dinajpur in 1959 had until 1956 been part of the Kishanganj region which is still characterised by a low overall literacy rate of 31 percent in 2006‚Äì07, against which the corresponding rate for Uttar Dinajpur as a whole is a literacy rate of 48 percent... ‚ÄúLike Kishanganj which is now a full-fledged Bihar district, Islampur SD too has a largely rural profile, a large Muslim population and deep concentration of rural poverty‚Äù... Persisting regional disparities in access to education and infrastructure, rather than the response and enthusiasm of the local people are largely responsible for making Uttar Dinajpur the least literate district in West Bengal. ‚ÄúThus, a major challenge facing the district relates to the improvement of educational attainments of the weaker social sections and women, especially among the Muslim community which has a dominant presence in the Islampur SD region‚Ä¶ A huge gulf separates the Muslim literacy rate of 36 percent in Uttar Dinajpur from the Muslim literacy rate of 58 percent achieved by West Bengal as a whole.‚Äù See also ‚Äì List of West Bengal districts ranked by literacy rate See also - Literacy in Bihar =Language and religion= In 2001, Bengali was the mother-tongue of 66.8% of the population of Uttar Dinajpur district, followed by Surajpuri (11.7%), Urdu (9.8%), Hindi (4.0%), Santali (4.0%), Telugu (0.4%), Kurukh/Oraon (0.3%), Bhojpuri (0.3%), Sadan/ Sadri (0.1%), Nepali (0.1%) and Maithili (0.1%). Other languages spoken were: Rajbansi, Oriya, Marwari and Munda. The proportion of population having Bengali as their mother tongue increased from 72.2% in 1961 to 76.5% in 1991 and then dropped to 66.8% in 2001. The proportion of population having Surajpuri as their mother tongue increased from 3.3% in 1991 to 11.7% in 2001. The proportion of population having Urdu as their mother tongue decreased from 10.1% in 1961 to 6.0% in 1971 and then increased to 9.8% in 2001. Information about mother-tongue is available only at the district level and above. In the District Census Handbook for Uttar Dinajpur district covering 2011 census, the mother-tongue information is provided for the period 1961 to 2001. The Human Development Report for Uttar Dinajpur describes the Islampur subdivision as ‚Äúa region where Urdu and Hindi are widely spoken as a first language because of the prior transfer of this territory to West Bengal from Bihar‚Äù As per the West Bengal Official Language (Amendment) Act, 2012, which came into force from December 2012, Urdu was given the status of official language in areas, such as subdivisions and blocks, having more than 10% Urdu speaking population. In Uttar Dinajpur district, Goalpokhar I and II blocks, Islampur block and Islampur municipality were identified as fulfilling the norms set In 2014, Calcutta High Court, in an order, included Dalkhola municipality in the list. In the 2011 census, Muslims numbered 186,818 and formed 64.14% of the population in Goalpokhar II CD Block. Hindus numbered 100,540 and formed 34.52% of the population. Christians numbered 3,348 and formed 1.15% of the population. Others numbered 540 and formed 0.19% of the population. In Goalpokhar I and Goalpokhar II CD Blocks taken together, as per the District Statistical Handbook for Uttar Dinajpur, while the proportion of Muslims increased from 67.71% in 1991 to 68.82% in 2001, the proportion of Hindus declined from 31.69% in 1991 to 30.19% in 2001. In the 2011 census, Uttar Dinajpur district had 1,501,170 Muslims who formed 49.92% of the population, 1,482,943 Hindus who formed 49.31% of the population, 16,702 Christians who formed 0.56% of the population and 6,319 persons belonging to other religions who formed 0.23% of the population. While the proportion of Muslim population in the district increased from 45.3% in 1991 to 49.9% in 2011, the proportion of Hindu population declined from 54.2% in 1991 to 49.2% in 2011. Rural poverty As per the Rural Household Survey conducted in 2002, 65.3% of the rural families in Goalpokhar II CD Block belonged to the BPL category, against 46.7% of rural families in Uttar Dinajpur district being in the BPL category. As per the Human Development Report for Uttar Dinajpur district, ‚ÄúThe two Goalpokhar blocks are placed in the least favourable positions in Uttar Dinajpur, both because of low levels of human development and high concentration of exclusion and human poverty. Goalpokhar-1 nevertheless does better than Itahar in terms of Human Poverty Index (HPI). Goalpokhar-2, on the other hand, is incontrovertibly the least developed block of Uttar Dinajpur district, with the lowest levels of human development and the highest concentration of human poverty‚Äù. Economy =Livelihood= In Goalpokhar II CD Block in 2011, amongst the class of total workers, cultivators numbered 20,158 and formed 22.05%, agricultural labourers numbered 53,558 and formed 58.58%, household industry workers numbered 2,953 and formed 3.23% and other workers numbered 14,758 and formed 16.14%. Total workers numbered 91,427 and formed 31.39% of the total population, and non-workers numbered 199,825 and formed 66.61% of the population. Note: In the census records a person is considered a cultivator, if the person is engaged in cultivation/ supervision of land owned by self/government/institution. When a person who works on another person's land for wages in cash or kind or share, is regarded as an agricultural labourer. Household industry is defined as an industry conducted by one or more members of the family within the household or village, and one that does not qualify for registration as a factory under the Factories Act. Other workers are persons engaged in some economic activity other than cultivators, agricultural labourers and household workers. It includes factory, mining, plantation, transport and office workers, those engaged in business and commerce, teachers, entertainment artistes and so on. =Infrastructure= There are 169 inhabited villages in Goalpokhar II CD Block. 166 villages (98.22%) have power supply. All 169 villages (100%) have drinking water supply. 32 villages (18.93%) have post offices. 160 villages (94.67%) have telephones (including landlines, public call offices and mobile phones). 77 villages (45.56%) have a pucca (paved) approach road and 38 villages (22.49%) have transport communication (includes bus service, rail facility and navigable waterways). 10 villages (5.92%) have agricultural credit societies. 9 villages (5.33%) have banks. =Agriculture= ‚ÄúWith its distinctive physiographic and agroclimatic features, the Dinajpur region has been a bread-basket area of Bengal for many centuries, growing multiple varieties of fine and coarse rice in vast quantities, along with major economic crops like jute. The livelihood profile of Uttar Dinajpur district has evolved in association with these old agricultural patterns, and more than two-thirds of its active workforce still draws livelihoods directly from agriculture and related occupations.‚Äù Agricultural potential has been uneven across Uttar Dinajpur based on soil conditions and irrigation potential. This has generated considerable internal migration within the district, as areas with higher agricultural potential and higher labour demand has attracted large number of people. The impact of land reforms has also varied. As the Islampur subdivision blocks evolved initially under the Bihar administration, the land estates were larger in size and the extent of land acquired under ceiling laws were higher. The cultivator population in Islampur subdivision was also thinner. Such conditions have been favourable for migrants. The movement of people from agricultural activities to non-agricultural activities has been low in Uttar Dinajpur district except for some pockets. Goalpokhar II CD Block had 93 fertiliser depots, 25 seed stores and 52 fair price shops in 2013‚Äì14.

History Historically the western frontier of ancient Pundravardhana kingdom, bordering ancient Anga of Mahabharat fame, the Dinajpur area remained somewhat obscure in the major empires that held sway over the region and beyond till the rise of the Dinajpur Raj during the Mughal period. Some areas later forming a part of Uttar Dinajpur were parts of kingdoms in Nepal. Dinajpur district was constituted by the British in 1786, with a portion of the estate of Dinajpur Raj. Subsequent to the Permanent Settlement in 1793, the semi-independent Dinajpur Raj was further broken down and some of its tracts were transferred to the neighbouring British districts of Purnea, Malda, Rajshahi and Bogra. In 1947, the Radcliffe Line placed the Sadar and Thakurgaon subdivisions of Dinajpur district in East Pakistan. The Balurghat subdivision of Dinajpur district was reconstituted as West Dinajpur district in West Bengal. Raiganj subdivision was formed in 1948. In order to restore territorial links between northern and southern parts of West Bengal which had been snapped during the partition of Bengal, and on the recommendations of the States Reorganisation Commission a portion of the erstwhile Kishanganj subdivision comprising Goalpokhar, Islampur and Chopra thanas (police stations) and parts of Thakurganj thana, along with the adjacent parts of the erstwhile Gopalpur thana in Katihar subdivision were transferred from Purnea district in Bihar to West Bengal in 1956, and were formally incorporated into Raiganj subdivision in West Dinajpur. The township of Kishanganj and its entire municipal boundary remained within Bihar. Islampur subdivision was formed in March 1959. At the same time, the portion of Chopra PS lying to the north of the Mahananda river covering an area that now comprises Bidhannagar-1 gram panchayat, Bidhannagar-2 GP, Chathat-Bansgaon GP and the southern half of Phansidewa-Bansgaon Kismat GP in Darjeeling district, was transferred from West Dinajpur to the jurisdiction of Phansidewa PS in Darjeling district. With the introduction of the Community Development Programme in 1960‚Äì61, community development blocks were set up in West Dinajpur district. In 1992, West Dinajpur district was bifurcated and Uttar Dinajpur district was established. Geography Islampur is located at . Uttar Dinajpur district has a flat topography and slopes gently from north to south. All rivers flow in that direction. Except for the eastern fringes of Chopra CD Block, most of the district is a part of the catchment area of the Mahanada and also a part of the larger Barind Tract The soil is composed of different varieties of alluvium. The main rivers are: Nagar, Mahananda, Kulik, Gamari, Chhiramati (Srimati) and Tangon. The rivers have little water in the dry season but with heavy rains, during monsoon, overflow the banks. The Nagar river flows along the international border with Bangladesh on the east of Islampur CD Block. The Sanauna, Dalaucha and Raba rivers flow through Islampur CD Block. Islampur CD Block is bounded by Potha CD Block in Kishanganj district of Bihar and Chopra CD Block on the north, Atwari Upazila of Panchagarh District of Bangladesh and Baliadangi Upazila of Thakurgaon District of Bangladesh on the east, Goalpokhar I CD Block on the south and Kishanganj CD Block in Kishanganj district of Bihar on the west. Approximately 206 km of the India-Bangladesh border is in Uttar Dinajpur district. It covers the eastern boundary of the district. On the western side Uttar Dinajpur district has 227 km boundary with Bihar. Islampur CD Block has an area of 329.44 km2.It has 1 panchayat samity, 13 gram panchayats, 178 gram sansads (village councils), 101 mouzas and 101 inhabited villages. Islampur police station serves this block. Headquarters of this CD Block is at Islampur. Uttar Dinajpur district is one of the smaller districts in the state and stands 15th in terms of area (3,140.00 km2) in the state. Gram panchayats of Islampur block/ panchayat samiti are: Agdimti-Khanti, Gaisal I, Gaisal II, Gobindapur, Gunjaria, Islampur, Kamalagaon-Sujali, Matukunda I, Matikunda II, Panditpota I, Panditpota II, Ramganj I and Ramganj II.

Other villages in Islampur CD Block included (2011 population in brackets): Gobindapur (1,110) and Panditpota (3,898). Decadal Population Growth Rate (%) Note: The CD Block data for 1971‚Äì1981, 1981-1991 and 1991-2001 is for Islampur PS covering the block The decadal growth of population in Islampur CD Block in 2001-2011 was 27.51%. The decadal growth of population in Islampur PS in 1991-2001 was 27.94%, in 1981-91 was 34.08% and in 1971-81 was 28.24%. The decadal growth rate of population in Uttar Dinajpur district was as follows: 30.2% in 1971‚Äì81, 34.0% in 1981‚Äì91, 28.7% in 1991-2001 and 23.2% in 2001‚Äì11. The decadal growth rate for West Bengal was 13.93% in 2001‚Äì2011, 17.77% in 1991‚Äì2001. 24.73% in 1981-1991 and 23.17% in 1971‚Äì1981. Uttar Dinajpur district has the highest decadal population growth rate in West Bengal with a figure of 23.2% for the decade 2001-2011 and is much higher than the state average of 13.8%. According to the Human Development Report for Uttar Dinajpur district, population growth in the area that later became Uttar Dinajpur district was low in the pre-independence era and started picking up with the waves of East Bengali refugees coming in from erstwhile East Pakistan. Despite the formation of an international border in 1947, none of the PS areas in the area which later formed Islampur SD showed much increase in settlement density between 1941‚Äì51, and accelerated settlement only came into evidence in this region after 1961, following their transfer from Bihar to West Bengal. Thus, as population growth in the Uttar Dinajpur region accelerated considerably under the impetus of partition migration after 1951, the Islampur SD areas offered additional living space, easing the overall migration pressure on the region. The Human Development Report analyses, ‚ÄúA spurt in population growth rates first became evident between 1951-1961, and was further magnified between 1971-81 after the creation of Bangladesh when population growth in most districts bordering the Bangladesh-West Bengal frontier showed similar escalation. However, after 1981, when population growth in most other West Bengal districts had tapered off, growth rates in Uttar Dinajpur again showed a fresh spurt. Thus, no deceleration in population growth rates occurred in the district until after 1991‚Ä¶ In addition to Hindu and tribal migrants from across the international border, a sizeable number of migrant Muslims have also settled in the district, mainly driven by economic reasons‚Ä¶ migrants from other states comprised 23% of the total migrants residing in Uttar Dinajpur.‚Äù The large number of migrants from other states is mainly from the neighbouring areas in Bihar. A study by North Bengal University has observed that ‚ÄúImmigrants from East Pakistan/Bangladesh have arrived in Uttar Dinajpur in almost equal numbers before and after 1971.‚Äù The Human Development Report opines, ‚ÄúThe overall post-Partition impact on the rates of demographic growth has been particularly strong in all North Bengal districts. Despite its smaller relative size, the region has received more migration in pro rata terms than the West Bengal districts lying south of the Ganga.‚Äù =Literacy= As per the 2011 census, the total number of literates in Islampur CD Block was 134,218 (53.53% of the population over 6 years) out of which males numbered 79,197 (61.14% of the male population over 6 years) and females numbered 55,021 (45.41% of the female population over 6 years). The gender disparity (the difference between female and male literacy rates) was 15.73%. The literacy rate in Uttar Dinajpur district at 60.13% in 2011, up from 47.89% in 2001, was the lowest amongst all districts of West Bengal. The highest literacy rate amongst the districts of West Bengal was that of Purba Medinipur district at 87.66% in 2011. According to the Human Development Report for Uttar Dinajpur district, ‚ÄúGoalpokhar-1, Goalpokhar-2, Karandighi and Islampur blocks in that order stood at the very bottom of the literacy scale in the state. This pooling of illiteracy within Islampur SD also led to the low ranking of Uttar Dinajpur at 494th position out of 595 Indian districts in terms of literacy rates in 2001, despite which its rank had improved considerably in relative terms from the 523rd rank it had occupied in 1991.‚Äù The five blocks transferred from the state of Bihar to form a new subdivision in West Dinajpur in 1959 had until 1956 been part of the Kishanganj region which is still characterised by a low overall literacy rate of 31 percent in 2006‚Äì07, against which the corresponding rate for Uttar Dinajpur as a whole is a literacy rate of 48 percent... \\"Like Kishanganj which is now a full-fledged Bihar district, Islampur SD too has a largely rural profile, a large Muslim population and deep concentration of rural poverty\\"... Persisting regional disparities in access to education and infrastructure, rather than the response and enthusiasm of the local people are largely responsible for making Uttar Dinajpur the least literate district in West Bengal. \\"Thus, a major challenge facing the district relates to the improvement of educational attainments of the weaker social sections and women, especially among the Muslim community which has a dominant presence in the Islampur SD region‚Ä¶ A huge gulf separates the Muslim literacy rate of 36 percent in Uttar Dinajpur from the Muslim literacy rate of 58 percent achieved by West Bengal as a whole.\\" See also ‚Äì List of West Bengal districts ranked by literacy rate See also - Literacy in Bihar =Language and religion= In 2001, Bengali was the mother-tongue of 66.8% of the population of Uttar Dinajpur district, followed by Surajpuri (11.7%), Urdu (9.8%), Hindi (4.0%), Santali (4.0%), Telugu (0.4%), Kurukh/Oraon (0.3%), Bhojpuri (0.3%), Sadan/ Sadri (0.1%), Nepali (0.1%) and Maithili (0.1%). Other languages spoken were: Rajbansi, Oriya, Marwari and Munda. The proportion of population having Bengali as their mother tongue increased from 72.2% in 1961 to 76.5% in 1991 and then dropped to 66.8% in 2001. The proportion of population having Surajpuri as their mother tongue increased from 3.3% in 1991 to 11.7% in 2001. The proportion of population having Urdu as their mother tongue decreased from 10.1% in 1961 to 6.0% in 1971 and then increased to 9.8% in 2001. Information about mother-tongue is available only at the district level and above. In the District Census Handbook for Uttar Dinajpur district covering 2011 census, the mother-tongue information is provided for the period 1961 to 2001. The Human Development Report for Uttar Dinajpur describes the Islampur subdivision as ‚Äúa region where Urdu and Hindi are widely spoken as a first language because of the prior transfer of this territory to West Bengal from Bihar‚Äù As per the West Bengal Official Language (Amendment) Act, 2012, which came into force from December 2012, Urdu was given the status of official language in areas, such as subdivisions and blocks, having more than 10% Urdu speaking population.

While the proportion of Muslim population in the district increased from 45.3% in 1991 to 49.9% in 2011, the proportion of Hindu population declined from 54.2% in 1991 to 49.2% in 2011. Rural poverty As per the Rural Household Survey conducted in 2002, 40.7% of the rural families in Islampur CD Block belonged to the BPL category, against 46.7% of rural families in Uttar Dinajpur district being in the BPL category. As per the Human Development Report for Uttar Dinajpur district, Islampur and Karandighi rank sixth and seventh in terms of human development, with respective Human Development Index (HDIs) that indicate the existence of a wide human development gap between them and the lowest ranked Raiganj SD block of Itahar. However, in terms of the concentration of human poverty, they occupy a more favourable position than Itahar. Economy =Livelihood= In Islampur CD Block in 2011, amongst the class of total workers, cultivators numbered 27,957 and formed 29.36%, agricultural labourers numbered 38,639 and formed 40.57%, household industry workers numbered 1,099 and formed 1.15% and other workers numbered 27,535 and formed 28.91%. Total workers numbered 95,230 and formed 30.87% of the total population, and non-workers numbered 213,288 and formed 69.13% of the population. Note: In the census records a person is considered a cultivator, if the person is engaged in cultivation/ supervision of land owned by self/government/institution. When a person who works on another person's land for wages in cash or kind or share, is regarded as an agricultural labourer. Household industry is defined as an industry conducted by one or more members of the family within the household or village, and one that does not qualify for registration as a factory under the Factories Act. Other workers are persons engaged in some economic activity other than cultivators, agricultural labourers and household workers. It includes factory, mining, plantation, transport and office workers, those engaged in business and commerce, teachers, entertainment artistes and so on. =Infrastructure= There are 101 inhabited villages in Islampur CD Block.

The livelihood profile of Uttar Dinajpur district has evolved in association with these old agricultural patterns, and more than two-thirds of its active workforce still draws livelihoods directly from agriculture and related occupations.‚Äù Agricultural potential has been uneven across Uttar Dinajpur based on soil conditions and irrigation potential. This has generated considerable internal migration within the district, as areas with higher agricultural potential and higher labour demand has attracted large number of people. The impact of land reforms has also varied. As the Islampur subdivision blocks evolved initially under the Bihar administration, the land estates were larger in size and the extent of land acquired under ceiling laws were higher. The cultivator population in Islampur subdivision was also thinner. Such conditions have been favourable for migrants. The movement of people from agricultural activities to non-agricultural activities has been low in Uttar Dinajpur district except for some pockets.

Born in Bendigo, Victoria, he studied law before joining the RAAF as an air cadet in 1932. An instructor at Point Cook from 1935 to 1937, he achieved renown in Air Force circles when he reportedly parachuted from a training aircraft to motivate his pupil to land single-handedly. He also became known to the general public as a cross-country motorist, setting records for trans-Australia and round- Australia trips prior to World War II. A flight lieutenant when war broke out, Balmer was promoted to squadron leader in June 1940, becoming the inaugural commanding officer of No. 13 Squadron, which operated Lockheed Hudsons out of Darwin, Northern Territory. He was raised to temporary wing commander in April 1941, and within a year had taken charge of the RAAF's first Bristol Beaufort unit, No. 100 Squadron. Appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in June 1942, he led the Beauforts on bombing and torpedo missions against Japanese targets in the New Guinea campaign. Posted to England in June 1943, Balmer took command of No. 467 Squadron RAAF, flying Avro Lancasters in the air war over Europe. He led his unit through the Battle of Berlin from November 1943 to March 1944. In April he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross, and the following month promoted to temporary group captain. Days later, on the night of 11/12 May, the last scheduled operation of his tour as No. 467 Squadron's commanding officer, Balmer failed to return from a mission over Belgium. Initially posted as missing, his plane was later confirmed to have been shot down, and all of the crew killed. Balmer was buried outside Brussels. Early life The son of lawyer Sydney Balmer and his wife Catherine (\\"Kittie\\"), John Balmer was born in Bendigo, Victoria, on 3 July 1910. He attended Scotch College before studying law at the University of Melbourne, where he was a resident of Trinity College, and rowed in the Second Eight. In December 1932, he enlisted as an air cadet in the RAAF active reserve, known as the Citizen Air Force (CAF).Coulthard-Clark, The Third Brother, pp. 225‚Äì226 Nicknamed \\"Sam\\", Balmer undertook flying instruction on the 1933 \\"B\\" (reservists) course conducted at RAAF Station Point Cook, Victoria, where his classmates included future group captain John Lerew.Coulthard-Clark, The Third Brother, p. 239 Balmer qualified as a pilot and was commissioned in April 1933. His first posting was to No. 1 Squadron, flying Westland Wapitis;King, Song of the Beauforts, pp. 321‚Äì323 he transferred from the CAF to the Permanent Air Force in November. Promoted to flight lieutenant, from July 1935 to November 1937 Balmer was assigned to No. 1 Flying Training School, Point Cook, as an instructor. He gained a reputation as a hard taskmaster, and on one occasion‚Äîaccording to RAAF folklore‚Äîparachuted from a training aircraft to give his student the proper motivation to make a solo landing, though at least one newspaper at the time reported that he had in fact fallen out.Coulthard-Clark, The Third Brother, pp. 206‚Äì207, 496 On 15 August 1938, Balmer was forced to crash land an Avro Anson near Whitfield, Victoria, after its wings iced up‚Äîone of a series of accidents that befell the type following its introduction to Australian service.Coulthard-Clark, The Third Brother, p. 329 By mid-1939 he was instructing on Hawker Demon biplane fighters with No. 3 Squadron at RAAF Station Richmond, New South Wales.Odgers, Mr Double Seven, p. 11 Parallel to his Air Force career, in the years leading up to the outbreak of World War II Balmer gained national attention as a long-distance motorist. Partnered by a fellow officer, he set a cross-country record of 65 hours and 10 minutes travelling from Perth, Western Australia, to Melbourne in December 1936. He and another driver followed this up with a record-breaking round-Australia journey in October‚ÄìNovember 1938, completing their run in 23¬Ω days, almost halving the previous best time. World War II =South West Pacific= When Australia declared war in September 1939, Flight Lieutenant Balmer was a member of No. 22 Squadron, which conducted coastal surveillance out of Richmond with Ansons and, later, CAC Wirraways.Roylance, Air Base Richmond, p. 115 Promoted to squadron leader, he was posted to RAAF Station Darwin, Northern Territory, on 1 June 1940, becoming the inaugural commander of No. 13 Squadron, which had been \\"cannibalised\\" from the base's resident unit, No. 12 Squadron. Retaining its Wirraway flight, No. 12 Squadron gave up its two flights of Ansons to the new formation; these were replaced later that month by more capable Lockheed Hudsons.Gillison, Royal Australian Air Force, pp. 125‚Äì126 From August 1940 until February 1941, No. 13 Squadron was responsible for patrolling the sea lanes off Australia's north coast. On occasion, Balmer detected Japanese luggers that were illegally fishing in Australian waters and, according to Mark Johnston, overflew them at such a low altitude that \\"his Hudson's slipstream rocked the boats violently\\" and the crew \\"shook their fists\\" at him.Johnston, Whispering Death, p. 45 He was promoted to temporary wing commander in April. The following month, No. 13 Squadron conducted familiarisation flights over the Dutch East Indies.RAAF Historical Section, Units of the Royal Australian Air Force, pp. 38‚Äì41 Balmer handed over command of the unit in August, and transferred to a liaison post at Headquarters RAAF Station Darwin.King, Song of the Beauforts, p. 16 alt=Informal half portrait of three men in military uniforms, with palm trees in the background In January 1942, Balmer briefly took charge of No. 7 Squadron, flying Hudsons on maritime patrol and convoy escort duties from RAAF Station Laverton, Victoria.RAAF Historical Section, Units of the Royal Australian Air Force, pp. 22‚Äì26 Two months later he assumed command of the first RAAF unit to operate Australian-built Bristol Beauforts, No. 100 Squadron.Gillison, Royal Australian Air Force, pp. 552‚Äì553 It was formed at Richmond using the number of a Royal Air Force (RAF) squadron that had been decimated in the Malayan Campaign.Roylance, Air Base Richmond, p. 126 In tribute to its original incarnation, Balmer adopted the RAF unit's crest, which featured a skull-and- crossbones emblem and the motto Sarang Tebuan Jangan Dijolok (Malay for \\"Do not stir up a hornet's nest\\").King, Song of the Beauforts, p. 17 No. 100 Squadron transferred to Mareeba in Far North Queensland on 22 May, after Balmer decided that a proposed base at Cairns was unsuitable owing to periodic flooding.King, Song of the Beauforts, pp. 22‚Äì24 While his crews at Mareeba gained experience on maritime patrols, he travelled to Port Moresby, New Guinea, on 26 May to test the Beaufort in operational conditions; as he came in to land he was fired upon by US anti-aircraft batteries, whose gunners had \\"never seen a Goddamn aircraft like that before\\", but escaped damage.King, Song of the Beauforts, pp. 24‚Äì26 Balmer was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the King's Birthday Honours on 11 June 1942. On 25 June he took five of No. 100 Squadron's Beauforts to Port Moresby, joining two other Beauforts that were already stationed there.Johnston, Whispering Death, p. 198 That night he led five aircraft from his squadron on their first bombing mission, against a Japanese ship reported in the Huon Gulf near Lae. Despite finding his bomb release gear faulty, necessitating three low-level attack runs in the face of increasingly heavy anti-aircraft fire, Balmer managed to score two hits, while his companions also successfully bombed the vessel. The ship appeared to be on fire and sinking, and the squadron received credit for its destruction at the time, but later investigation could not confirm its loss. The unit withdrew to Laverton for training and patrol work during July and August, before moving to Milne Bay to again take part in the New Guinea campaign.RAAF Historical Section, Units of the Royal Australian Air Force, pp. 99‚Äì102 On 7 September 1942, Balmer commanded a combined force of P-40 Kittyhawks from Nos. 75 and 76 Squadrons, Bristol Beaufighters from No. 30 Squadron, Hudsons from No. 6 Squadron, and his own No. 100 Squadron Beauforts in an assault on Japanese shipping near Milne Bay. It was the first time the Beauforts had been armed with torpedoes in combat, and they failed to score any hits.Gillison, Royal Australian Air Force, pp. 615‚Äì616 alt=Three- quarter view of twin-engined military aircraft on jungle landing Beginning in October 1942, Nos. 6 and 100 Squadrons were given what the official history of the RAAF in World War II called the \\"huge task\\" of keeping open the sea lanes between Australia and New Guinea, while disrupting as best they could Japanese lines of communication and supply. The units kept up a punishing schedule of daily long-range reconnaissance and anti-submarine patrols, according to the official history, \\"practically without navigation aids, frequently through rain storms and heavy cloud\\" but, \\"supported by ground staffs as enduring as themselves, the crews maintained an almost inflexibly high standard and achieved considerable success\\".Gillison, Royal Australian Air Force, pp. 639‚Äì640 On the night of 4/5 October, Balmer took ten of his Beauforts from Milne Bay on a far-ranging assault against Japanese ships in the vicinity of the Shortland Islands, near Bougainville. Two aircraft disappeared along the way in storms and the remainder became separated into two flights that nevertheless managed to rendezvous near the target. Seven of these launched their torpedoes against as many ships and the crews believed that four were accurate, but were unable to confirm any hits because of dwindling visibility. The mission was considered a failure but this was put down to problems with the torpedoes and not the aircrew. Subsequent reports suggested that three ships had in fact been damaged. Balmer came down with malaria in November 1942, and went on three weeks sick leave the following month; he returned to operations on 2 January 1943.King, Song of the Beauforts, pp. 7, 771 In March, during the Battle of the Bismarck Sea, No. 100 Squadron launched its last torpedo attack; bad weather prevented all but two aircraft finding their targets, and no hits were registered. Towards the end of the month the unit dropped of bombs on Japanese installations in Salamaua.Stephens, The Royal Australian Air Force, p. 162 =Europe= alt=Front three-quarter view of military aeroplane with propellers spinning, silhouetted against the sky Balmer relinquished command of No. 100 Squadron in April 1943, and was posted from the South West Pacific to the European theatre that June. His planned secondment to the RAF was for two years.King, Song of the Beauforts, pp. 90‚Äì91 Partly in an effort to bolster Australian aspirations to form a distinct RAAF group within RAF Bomber Command, in August he was appointed commanding officer of No. 467 Squadron, based at RAF Bottesford, Leicestershire. The squadron had been raised under Article XV of the Empire Air Training Scheme, and operated Avro Lancaster heavy bombers.Herington, Air War Against Germany and Italy, p. 649 RAAF Historical Section, Units of the Royal Australian Air Force, pp. 144‚Äì147 Balmer led his unit in a costly raid on Nuremberg the night of 27/28 August, before attacking Hanover in September and October. From its new base at RAF Waddington, Lincolnshire, Balmer then took No. 467 Squadron through the Battle of Berlin that commenced in November 1943 and continued until March 1944. The statistical likelihood of surviving an operational tour of 30 missions in Bomber Command was never more than 50 per cent, and during the Battle of Berlin, loss rates were far higher.Stephens, The Royal Australian Air Force, pp. 95‚Äì96 No. 467 Squadron was the only Australian unit to take part in all sixteen heavy attacks against the German capital during the battle.Herington, Air War Against Germany and Italy, pp. 636‚Äì637, 642‚Äì643 In the same period it also raided Frankfurt, Leipzig, Stettin, Stuttgart, Essen, and Augsburg.Herington, Air War Against Germany and Italy, pp. 651, 653, 655, 658‚Äì660 Following the Battle of Berlin, No. 467 Squadron began to concentrate on targets in France and Belgium as the Allied air campaign shifted focus from strategic bombing to destroying airfields and disrupting lines of communication prior to the invasion of the continent. On the night of 10/11 April, Balmer led not only his own unit but a total of 148 aircraft of No. 5 Group RAF in an assault on Toulouse, striking at an airfield, and aircraft and explosives factories. The bombing was highly accurate, and the Australians suffered no losses on the raid.Herington, Air Power Over Europe, pp. 19‚Äì21 Balmer (right) as commanding officer of No. 467 Squadron, with another officer following an investiture ceremony at alt=Informal half portrait of two men in dark military uniforms with pilot's wings on the left pockets Considered a \\"dynamic\\" leader and a \\"brilliant\\" pilot, Balmer was decorated with the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC) for \\"great skill and devotion to duty\\" during \\"a varied tour of operations\\"; promulgated in the London Gazette on 18 April, the award citation further described him as \\"a most efficient squadron commander, whose keenness and zeal have set a fine example\\". He also earned the respect of his crews with displays of empathy such as the occasion one of his young pilots, who had flown on 15 missions, refused to take off on his next sortie. Rather than take disciplinary action, Balmer allowed the man medical leave and sought out respite for him in the country, after which the pilot returned to active duty and completed his tour of operations. From early April, No. 467 Squadron began playing a leading role in a series of attacks against railways, which continued into the following month.Herington, Air Power Over Europe, pp. 27‚Äì28 Balmer was promoted to temporary group captain on 4 May 1944. On 10/11 May, his Lancasters took part in a raid on Lille, losing three of their number. In an effort to shore up the morale of his younger crews, Balmer decided to personally lead their next mission the following night, against a military camp at Bourg-L√©opold (Leopoldsburg), Belgium. It was planned to be his last operation before going on to a more senior position. His aircraft failed to return from the raid, causing considerable shock to his unit. The next day, Balmer's place as commanding officer of No. 467 Squadron was taken by Wing Commander William Brill, previously a member of No. 463 Squadron RAAF, which was also based at Waddington.Herington, Air Power Over Europe, pp. 37‚Äì38 Initially posted as missing, Balmer and his crew were later confirmed to have died when their Lancaster crashed near Herenthout in provincial Antwerp after being attacked by a night fighter. Balmer was buried in Heverlee War Cemetery, outside Brussels. The Daily Mail reported that he had accumulated almost 5,000 flying hours, and compared his place in the RAAF to that of Leonard Cheshire's in the RAF. Aged 33, Balmer was unmarried at his death. His DFC was presented to his mother Kittie by the Governor-General of Australia shortly after the end of the war. Balmer's name appears at panel 110 of the Commemorative Area at the Australian War Memorial, Canberra.

William's descendants settled in New Amsterdam (now known as New York (city)) in the early 1600s; he had famous descendants and relatives in North American history; and many North Americans can trace their lineage to William. William and his family appear to have survived the murderous rampage of the Spanish Fury in 1576. A version of William's life tells that he was a Huguenot that fled Paris on the day before the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre of 1572.

Unfortunately Middelburg's archives were destroyed during World War II. William Provost moved to Amsterdam around 1605 and he was still alive in 1607 when his daughter Katherina married. William's will, written in 1606, lists three of his children: Elijsabeth (deceased but whose child was alive), Katherina, and Wilhelmus.Hendrik O Slok, \\"The Provoost Family in the Netherlands\\", The New York Genealogical and Biographical Record, Vol 113, No 1, Jan 1982, The New York Genealogical and Biographical Society, New York.

Although some aspects of this version are incorrect it is important to document this version as these events have been oft quoted by his descendants. There are two major historical references that document one version of William's life: * A manuscript from 1724, written by William‚Äôs great great grandson David Provost (1670-1725)Andrew J Provost (compiled from his notes), \\"History of the Provoost Family of New Amsterdam and Colonial New York from 1545 to 1724\\", The New York Genealogical and Biographical Record, Vol 89, No 4, Oct 1958, The New York Genealogical and Biographical Society, New York * The book \\"Biographical and Genealogical Notes of the Provost Family from 1545 to 1895\\", written by a descendant Andrew J ProvostAndrew J Provost (written and published), ‚ÄúBiographical and Genealogical Notes of the Provost Family from 1545 to 1895‚Äù, New York, 1895, retrieved 2011-03-11 These references tell the story that William lived in Paris and was warned by a Colonel in the King's army about the impending St. Bartholomew's Day massacre. It is then reported that William fled to Holland with his fiancee, escaping the massacre. William was also described as \\"... a person of distinction and eminence ...\\" and \\"noble blood\\".Andrew J Provost (written and published), ‚ÄúBiographical and Genealogical Notes of the Provost Family from 1545 to 1895‚Äù, New York, 1895, retrieved 2011-03-11 This version of William's life lists his children as Johannes, David, Wilhelmes, Elias, and Benjamin. Johannes was actually Wilhelmus, the father of David who emigrated to New Amsterdam (now known as New York (city)) in 1624 (see below). There seems to have been some confusion regarding William Provost's story that was handed down to the following generations. Perhaps the story that William Provost was warned by a Colonel in the army and fled is correct ... only that it occurred in Antwerp prior to the Spanish Fury.

Personal life Platou was born to the banker Gabriel Andreas Stoud Platou (1858‚Äì1911) and his wife Ingeborg Sophie Falck (1864‚Äì1958). His younger brother was the architect Frithjof Stoud Platou. He was also nephew of Christian Emil Stoud Platou and Waldemar Stoud Platou, and cousin of Karen Platou. He married Anna Margareta von Friesen Parelius (1892‚Äì1970) on 11 October 1919, but divorced with her in 1939. On 5 April the same year, Platou married Anette Beate Wackenitz Horn (1908‚Äì94). Career Platou was born in Hamar, but studied at Otto Treider's private school in Kristiania from 1914 to 1915. He was thereafter employed in a shipbroking company named Conrad Boe Ltd. In June 1932, the organisation Tankskibscentralen was established, which was headed by Platou. However, the organisation gained little support, and was disestablished in the end of 1933. On 1 February 1936, Platou started his own shipbroking company, R. S. Platou. The company gained surplus in the first years, and had a staff of 20 people. In 1957, the staff comprised 40 people. In 1963, a research department was established, which some years later was separated into a subsidiary with the name A/S Shipping Consultants. In 1972, Platou decided to establish a new research department in the company. Platou was interested in golf, and headed several golf clubs in Norway. Platou was decorated as a Commander of the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav in 1975. He was also decorated as a Commander of the Swedish Order of Vasa, as a Knight of the Danish Dannebrog Order and as an officer of the Dutch Order of Orange- Nassau. He died on 1 April 1979.

They were invented in 2003 by James Aspnes and Gauri Shah. A nearly identical data structure called SkipNet was independently invented by Nicholas Harvey, Michael Jones, Stefan Saroiu, Marvin Theimer and Alec Wolman, also in 2003. Skip graphs have the full functionality of a balanced tree in a distributed system. Skip graphs are mostly used in searching peer-to-peer networks. As they provide the ability to query by key ordering, they improve over search tools based on the hash table functionality only. In contrast to skip lists and other tree data structures, they are very resilient and can tolerate a large fraction of node failures. Also, constructing, inserting, searching and repairing a skip graph that was disturbed by failing nodes can be done by straightforward algorithms. Description A skip graph is a distributed data structure based on skip lists designed to resemble a balanced search tree. They are one of several methods to implement a distributed hash table, which are used to locate resources stored in different locations across a network, given the name (or key) of the resource. Skip graphs offer several benefits over other distributed hash table schemes such as Chord (peer-to-peer) and Tapestry (DHT), including addition and deletion in expected logarithmic time, logarithmic space per resource to store indexing information, no required knowledge of the number of nodes in a set and support for complex range queries. A major distinction from Chord and Tapestry is that there is no hashing of search keys of resources, which allows related resources to be near each other in the skip graph; this property makes searches for values within a given range feasible. Another strength of skip graphs is the resilience to node failure in both random and adversarial failure models. Implementation details As with skip lists, nodes are arranged in increasing order in multiple levels; each node in level i is contained in level i+1 with some probability p (an adjustable parameter). Level 0 consists of one doubly linked list containing all of the nodes in the set. Lists becoming increasingly sparse at higher levels, until the list is composed of just one node. Where skip graphs differ from skip lists is that each level i‚â•1, will contain multiple lists; membership of a key x in a list is defined by the membership vector . The membership vector is defined as an infinite random word over a fixed alphabet, each list in the skip graph is identified by a finite word w from the same alphabet, if that word is a prefix of then node x is a member of the list. Operations Skip graphs support the basic operations of search, insert and delete. Skip graphs will also support the more complex range search operation. =Search= The search algorithm for skip graphs is almost identical to the search algorithm for skip lists but it is modified to run in a distributed system. Searches start at the top level and traverse through the structure. At each level, the search traverses the list until the next node contains a greater key. When a greater key is found, the search drops to the next level, continuing until the key is found or it is determined that the key is not contained in the set of nodes. If the key is not contained in the set of nodes the largest value less than the search key is returned. Each node in a list has the following fields: ; :The node's value. ; :An array containing pointers to the right and left neighbor in the node's doubly linked at level i. search(searchOp, startNode, searchKey, level) if (v.key = searchKey) then send(foundOp, v) to startNode if (v.key < searchKey) then while level ‚â• 0 if (v.neighbor[R][level].key ‚â§ searchKey) then send(searchOp, startNode, searchKey, level) to v.neighbor[R][level] break else level = level - 1 else while level ‚â• 0 if ((v.neighbor[L][level]).key ‚â• searchKey) then send(searchOp, startNode, searchKey, level) to v.neighbor[L][level] break else level = level - 1 if (level < 0) then send(notFoundOp, v) to startNode Analysis performed by William Pugh shows that on average, a skip list and by extension a skip graph contains Oleft(frac{log n}{log(1/p)}right) levels for a fixed value of . Given that at most frac{1}{1-p} nodes are searched on average per level, the total expected number of messages sent is Oleft(frac{log n}{(1-p)log(1-p)}right) and the expected time for the search is Oleft(frac{log n}{(1-p)log(1-p)}right). Therefore, for a fixed value of , the search operation is expected to take time using messages. =Insert= Insertion is done in two phases and requires that a new node knows some introducing node ; the introducing node may be any other node currently in the skip graph. In the first phase the new node uses the introducing node to search for its own key; this search is expected to fail and return the node with the largest key smaller than . In the second phase inserts itself in each level until it is the only element in a list at the top level. Insertion at each level is performed using standard doubly linked list operations; the left neighbor's next pointer is changed to point to the new node and the right neighbor's previous pointer is changed to point to the node. insert() search for = 0 while true insert into level L from Scan through level to find such which has membership vector matching membership vector of for first +1 characters if no exists exit else = = + 1 Similar to the search, the insert operation takes expected O(log n) messages and O(log n) time. With a fixed value of p; the search operation in phase 1 is expected to take O(log n) time and messages. In phase 2 at each level L ‚â• 0, communicates with an average 1/p other nodes to locate ', this will require O(1/p) time and messages leading to O(1) time and messages for each step in phase 2. =Delete= Nodes may be deleted in parallel at each level in O(1) time and O(log n) messages. When a node wishes to leave the graph it must send messages to its immediate neighbors to rearrange their next and previous pointers. delete() for L = 1 to max level, in parallel delete u from each level. delete u from level 0 The skip graph contains an average of O(log n) levels; at each level u must send 2 messages to complete a delete operation on a doubly linked list. As operations on each level may be done in parallel the delete operation may be finished using O(1) time and expected O(log n) messages. Fault tolerance In skip graphs, fault tolerance describes the number of nodes which can be disconnected from the skip graph by failures of other nodes. Two failure models have been examined; random failures and adversarial failures. In the random failure model any node may fail independently from any other node with some probability. The adversarial model assumes node failures are planned such that the worst possible failure is achieved at each step, the entire skip graph structure is known and failures are chosen to maximize node disconnection. A drawback of skip graphs is that there is no repair mechanism; currently the only way to remove and to repair a skip graph is to build a new skip graph with surviving nodes. =Random failure= Skip graphs are highly resistant to random failures. By maintaining information on the state of neighbors and using redundant links to avoid failed neighbors, normal operations can continue even with a large number of node failures. While the number of failed nodes is less than Oleft(frac{1}{log n}right) the skip graph can continue to function normally. Simulations performed by James Aspnes show that a skip graph with 131072 nodes was able tolerate up to 60% of its nodes failing before surviving nodes were isolated. While other distributed data structures may be able to achieve higher levels of resiliency they tend to be much more complex. =Adversarial failure= Adversarial failure is difficult to simulate in a large network as it becomes difficult to find worst case failure patterns. Theoretical analysis shows that the resilience depends based on the vertex expansion ratio of the graph, defined as follows. For a set of nodes A in the graph G, the expansion factor is the number of nodes not in A but adjacent to a node in A divided by the number of nodes in A. If skip graphs have a sufficiently large expansion ratio of Omegaleft(frac{1}{log n}right) then at most nodes may be separated, even if up to f failures are specifically targeted.

Biography Slamnig was born on 13 March 1956 in Zagreb, where he finished his primary education as well as graduated from grammar school. He allegedly never finished his musical education as well as his studies at the Faculty of Philosophy of the University of Zagreb. He attended further education in the US, in Bloomington, Indiana and in Chicago. Writing career Slamnig's writing attempts became more serious in 1977, when he started publishing his short stories in youth periodicals, mainly in Polet. Those stories were re-published in the collection ƒåudovi≈°te (Monster) in 1980. The next three years he continued publishing short stories, gathered into a second collection, \\"Qwertzu i Op≈°\\" in 1983. After that book came out, a long period of literary silence ensued. Slamnig resuscitated as an author in 2002, when he published the novel Topli zrak (Hot Air).English translations of Chapter 19 and Chapter 43 That was the first printed \\"long-playing\\" effort by the Zagreb author that sparked a great interest among the public, and which was awarded Jutarnji list's First Prize. The novel entered the finals of the Bosnian prize Me≈°a Selimoviƒá. Slamnig returned to the short story format (or, at least, to collecting them into a book) in 2005 with the title Krumpirova rodbina (Potato's Kin). The collection contained works published from 1986 until 2005.Some of the short stories can be found at Krumpirova rodbina, in Croatian and in English He was presented with awards for two of the short stories from that book, \\"Teletabisi\\"Teletabisi, in Croatian (\\"Teletubbies\\"Teletubbies, in English) and \\"Kak smo postali Dalmatinci\\"Kak smo svi postali Dalmatinci, in Croatian (\\"How We All Became Dalmatians\\"), with the Second Prize of Veƒçernji list in 2004, and with the Prize Ranko Marinkoviƒá and the Prize of Veƒçernji list in 2006 respectively. In 2011 Slamnig published a short story \\"Meaning\\"Meaning, in English (\\"Smisao\\"Smisao, in Croatian) in the May/June 2010 International Science Fiction issueInternational Science Fiction, May/June 2010 Issue, guest edited by Christopher McKitterick of the World Literature Today (WLT) magazine. Musical career At the same time Slamnig pursued a musical career. His first published song was \\"Debil Blues\\", written together with Goran \\"Pipo\\" Paveliƒá, the first playable and singable comic, drawn by the then informal leader of the Zagreb comic group Novi Kvadrat, Mirko Iliƒá. In 1979 Slamnig joined the Slovenian cult band Buldo≈æer as a guitarist. As member of the band he played and sang on their 1980 album Izlog jeftinih slatki≈°a. It was an important album for the group, that was left without one of the key members and authors, Marko Brecelj who left not long ago. Apart from playing the guitar, Slamnig co-authored the songs \\"Karlo\\", \\"Slovinjak punk\\" and \\"≈Ωene i mu≈°karci\\", the latter being called a hit single by band-members: Slamnig also delivered Brecelj's poem \\"Okrutni bogovi istoka\\". Slamnig did not remain a member of Buldo≈æer for a long time, which comes not as a surprise regarding the fact that he lived in Zagreb, and the rest of the band in Slovenia. Slamnig gathered his own band with ≈Ωarko Mandiƒá on bass and Radovan Luƒçiƒá on drums, while the vocal duties were delegated to the then leading Zagreb actress Mira Furlan. The album Mira Furlan i Orkestar Davora Slamniga was recorded in Ljubljana at the end of 1982, and it was published by in Maribor by Helidon, where Boris Bele, the leader of Buldo≈æer acted as Editor in Chief. The then unknown Srƒëan Dediƒá playing the piano and synthesizer as guest musician. Almost all the lyrics and music were written by Slamnig. Only the lyrics for \\"Djeƒçaƒçiƒái\\" were coauthored by Furlan, and the music for \\"Samo da te malo\\" by Mandiƒá. The album became one of the lost masterpieces of Zagreb music from the so-called New Wave era. Slamnig played in the band Dee Dee Mellow for a while, while the group was dissolving slowly after publishing a single audio-cassette. Slamnig wrote the score for the popular TV-show Blentoni, and his song \\"Frida\\" was recorded by Psihomodo Pop. Today Slamnig is a member of the band Psi od SlamePjer ≈Ωardin i njegovi Psi od Slame (Straw Dogs) with another veteran \\"gray eminence\\" of the New Wave era, the musician and theatre-person Pjer ≈Ωardin. Up to this day the band has released no official recordings apart from those available at their Internet site. Other activities Slamnig created and recorded some jingles for the Zagreb Radio 101 as well as answering machine messages. He also did some programming.

It aired on E4 on 17 March 2011.http://www.e4.com/skins/series5/episode-guides.html Synopsis Grace, lying to her father that she is saying goodbye to the gang, sets off to Liv's place to prepare for her wedding. Blood gives her a brooch, without telling her it has a tracking device in it. Meanwhile, Rich is given a haircut ‚Äì and most of his hair is cut off in the process. Mini goes to the Levan house and coldly orders Matty to stay away from Franky, whom she has been protecting because Matty has \\"made her ill.\\" After making final preparations, the gang set off for the church in a neighbouring town. Alo, Rich's best man, has not brought a proper map with him, and drives them into the middle of nowhere, where the van breaks down. Angry with him, Rich and Grace manage to hitch a ride to the church. The gang set off on foot. Liv and Matty, however, lose confidence in Alo's navigation skills and decide to set off on their own. They invite Franky to go along with them, and despite Mini's pleas, Franky agrees. Rich and Grace finally make it to the church, but discover they have missed their slot. The priest offers them a slot in an hour. Liv, Matty and Franky, meanwhile, take some MDMA and reach a nearby village. They break into the village church (not the one they are meant to go to) and Matty begins to play the piano. Liv, remembering his reaction at seeing her kiss Franky in Twelfth Night, starts to seduce Franky in front of him. He shakes his head at her, and they are chased off by a gun-wielding local. After reaching safety, Matty and Liv have an argument about Liv's actions in the church, and she admits that she is afraid of losing him. Franky keeps going, and Liv desperately begs Matty to stay with her, but he chooses to go after Franky instead. Mini, meanwhile, gets fed up with Alo and Nick's seemingly uncaring behaviour, because she is worried that something will happen to her friend. She splits off from the two and goes to find Liv, Matty and Franky herself. This leaves Alo and Nick to take their own route. On the way, Nick gets snared in a rabbit trap. Alo manages to free his leg and helps him limp on, until they reach a road. Mini manages to meet up with Liv, and, after discovering that Franky is missing, admits that she is frightened for Franky‚Äôs safety, which prompts Liv to question whether Mini has a crush on Franky; she and Liv reconcile and set off to find Franky and Matty. Problems get worse when Professor Blood, while having lunch, sees Grace's location on his GPS and immediately goes after her. Matty eventually catches up with Franky, and they stand in the middle of the forest. They have a heated argument, and she tearfully recounts having said that 9/11 was \\"the most beautiful thing\\" she could think of as a 6-year-old child, which had made her schoolmates and teachers believe she was mentally disturbed, and believes that her parents knew she was 'wrong', which is why she was put up for adoption. The two then start to kiss on the forest floor. Very suddenly, Franky has a panic attack and throws Matty off before running off through the woods in a blind rage, with a shocked Matty in hot pursuit. She runs past Liv and Mini, who stop Matty and demand an explanation. Seeing him hastily button up his trousers, they realise what has happened and, frightened that Franky might hurt herself in her current state of mind, join in the chase. As they catch up with Franky and call to her, she is distracted, trips over a branch, and falls over the side of a cliff. Despite some resistance from Franky, Liv manages to pull her back up, and they gather around to comfort her. Meanwhile, Alo and Nick see David Blood drive past on his way to the church, and desperately flag down a ride. They manage to get there ahead of him, and warn Grace and Rich, who proceed with the service. Before it can continue, David and Sonia enter the Church. They have a confrontation with Grace, as Mini, Franky, Liv and Matty arrive. Blood angrily informs everyone that they are expelled, but Nick angrily accuses him of flaunting his powers, before making an impassioned speech. Blood sullenly agrees to let them continue, and leaves the church. But Grace and Rich decide that they don‚Äôt need to get married after all, and proceed to a nearby marquee, to celebrate the wedding. There, Liv and Matty reconcile but break up and are left on somewhat good terms, and Franky calms down. As she enters the marquee, she and Matty text each other from across the tent and eventually make peace. The episode ends as the two embrace.

Das Ratna engaged in business in Tibet during his early years and was known by the nickname Baran Sahu (‡§¨‡§æ‡§∞‡§æ‡§Ç ‡§∏‡§æ‡§π‡•Å).Aniruddha, Bhikshu (July 2004). Mahosadha Mahajataka. Taipei: The Corporate Body of the Buddha Educational Foundation. Page 3. He was married to Dibya Laxmi with whom he had two sons and a daughter. Grief at the death of his wife and his association with Mahapandit Rahul Sankrityayan of India drew him towards religion.Sudarshan, Bhikshu (1970). Lumankebahapin (\\"Memorable Figures\\"). Kathmandu: Chwasapasa. Pages 75-84. His elder son Gaja Ratna too became a Buddhist monk, taking up the name Aniruddha Mahathera. Imprisonment and ordination In 1929, Das Ratna went to Sri Lanka for religious study. Returning to Nepal, he lived at the monastery of Kindo Baha near Swayambhu where he conducted regular prayer meetings and distributed pamphlets written in Nepal Bhasa appealing for donations. On 6 November 1931, he was arrested and imprisoned for seven days as it was illegal to write in Nepal Bhasa or propagate Buddhism. Subsequently, Das Ratna went to Rangoon, Burma (now Yangon, Myanmar) where he lived a year. Returning from Burma, he went to Kusinagar where he became a novice monk and took the name Dhammalok in 1933.Mahasthavir, Bhikkhu Dharmaloka (1999). A Pilgrimage in China. Kathmandu: Bhikkhu Aniruddha Mahasthavir. Page 17. Dhammalok returned to Kindo Baha, where he began writing a series of books in Nepal Bhasa that challenged traditional thinking. Lokay Kuchal Kubyabahar Sudhar (\\"Reforming Ill Practices and Customs in Society\\") and Dharmaya Namay Pap (\\"Sinning in the Name of Religion\\") published from Varanasi, India are some of his well-known works. Dhammalok has also translated Buddha Charita, a biography of the Buddha by Asva Ghosh, into Nepal Bhasa from the Sanskrit. Page 305. Among his notable books, the travelogue Mahachin Yatra (\\"A Journey to Great China\\") was published from Kalimpong in 1950. Dhammalok received higher ordination in Sarnath in 1935.Mahasthavir, Bhikkhu Dharmaloka (1999). A Pilgrimage in China. Kathmandu: Bhikkhu Aniruddha Mahasthavir. Page 30. Into exile In 1943, Dhammalok established Ananda Kuti Vihar, the first Theravada monastery in modern Nepal, at Swayambhu. It became the center for the Theravada community. The government declared that the activities of the Theravada monks of spreading Buddhism and writing in Nepal Bhasa were illegal, and on 30 July 1944, eight monks including Dhammalok, Pragyananda Mahasthavir and Kumar Kashyap Mahasthavir were expelled from Nepal for refusing to sign a pledge to stop doing so.Mahasthavir, Bhikkhu Dharmaloka (1999). A Pilgrimage in China. Kathmandu: Bhikkhu Aniruddha Mahasthavir. Pages 124-125. The exiled monks first went to Kushinagar, India and then to Sarnath. On the full moon day of 31 November 1944 in Sarnath, they founded Dharmodaya Sabha (Society for the Rise of the Teaching) which published books and a magazine on Buddhism titled Dharmodaya. Dhammalok spent his exile in India, Tibet and Bhutan, and returned to Kathmandu on 5 June 1946 after the ban was lifted. Page 7. From 1946, following pressure from Indian Buddhist societies, the government also allowed publication of literature in Nepal Bhasa after being censored. Page 10. Dhammalok devoted his later years to writing. He also worked to develop Lumbini and Kapilavastu, the Buddha's birthplace and family home in southern Nepal. Dhammalok died at Ananda Kuti Vihar.

It largely follows the meandering course of the Neckar river, but, between N√ºrtingen and T√ºbingen the line runs through the Swabian Alps. Between Stuttgart and Plochingen the line runs parallel to the Fils Valley Railway, trains on this section also sometimes use the Fils Valley line tracks. The line is fully electrified and double track throughout. Interchange is possible between Plochingen and T√ºbingen in Wendlingen am Neckar, N√ºrtingen, Metzingen and Reutlingen. There are level crossings in Wendlingen, Oberboihingen and Wannweil. There are three crossings in Oberboihingen, including two which can be manually operated by a gatekeeper, the only ones in Germany. History The first section of the Plochingen‚ÄìT√ºbingen opened in 1859 between Plochingen (which had been connected to Stuttgart by the W√ºrttemberg Central Railway, now the Fils Valley Railway, since 1846) and Reutlingen by the Royal W√ºrttemberg State Railways. In 1861 the Upper Neckar line was extended via T√ºbingen to Rottenburg. The line was extended to Eyach (1864) and Horb am Neckar (1866) and eventually reached Immendingen in 1870. The line towards Horb from T√ºbingen is still known as the Upper Neckar Railway, but there are only a few through trains running on both sections of the line. As early as 1888 the line was duplicated to T√ºbingen and the line was electrified by 1 October 1934. Neither upgrade have yet been carried out on the line towards Horb. The former stations of Bempflingen, Betzingen and Kirchentellinsfurt have been reduced in status to halts (Haltepunkten, that is they do not have sets of points) in the second half of the 20th century. In addition, between Plochingen and T√ºbingen many sidings and freight yards have been abandoned. Current operations  A dense network of regional trains, including Interregio-Express services, connect the Neckar-Alb region with the transportat hub of Stuttgart Hauptbahnhof. The line is operated by DB ZugBus Regionalverkehr Alb-Bodensee (RAB), a subsidiary of Deutsche Bahn. Signalling on the Plochingen-Wendlingen section is control by an electronic interlocking in Plochingen, itself controlled from the operations centre in Karlsruhe. There is also an electronic signal box in Reutlingen in operation. Otherwise, signalling in controlled by relay interlockings. =S-Bahn= Between Stuttgart and Kirchheim unter Teck S-Bahn services on line S1 of the Stuttgart S-Bahn run on the tracks of the Neckar-Alb Railway. This line passes through Plochingen, Wernau, Wendlingen am Neckar, Kirchheim (Teck)-√ñtlingen to Kirchheim unter Teck. =Regionalbahn = Former Neckartailfingen halt Regionalbahn (RB) services run from Monday to Friday between Plochingen and T√ºbingen every hour, from Metzingen to Reutlingen every half-hour and every half-hour to T√ºbingen in the peak hour. On weekends, RB services run every two hours; on Saturday mornings there are additional services between and Metzingen and T√ºbingen. Nearly all regional services continue from T√ºbingen on the Ammer Valley Railway to Herrenberg. Almost all RB services are formed of class 650 diesel multiple units. =Regional Express = Regional-Express on the railway near Kirchentellinsfurt Steinach in N√ºrtingen Plochingen station Oberboihingen station Regional-Express (RE) services run on the line every hour and every half-hour in peak hours. Almost all RE are services are hauled by class 143 locomotives. There are two services each way with old double-deck carriages (with green seats and no air conditioning), three services, each with five double-deck carriages (with air conditioning and LED lighting) delivered in 2008 and one service with five refurbished Silberling carriages plus a control car in both the morning and afternoon rush hour. The last pair of trains to and from T√ºbingen is usually operated with class 611 diesel multiple units. The RE trains between Stuttgart Hauptbahnhof and T√ºbingen Hauptbahnhof stop in Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt, Esslingen, Plochingen, Wendlingen, N√ºrtingen, Metzingen and Reutlingen Hauptbahnhof. The extra peak services also stop in Wernau. =Interregio-Express = Between T√ºbingen and Stuttgart an Interregio-Express (IRE) service operated every two hours with only one stop in Reutlingen. Almost all of the IRE services are operated with class 612 diesel multiple units. In peak hours there are additional IRE services operated with locomotive-hauled trains. These use a class 110 electric locomotive hauling three Silberling carriages and a driving trailer. =Long distance= Since the timetable change in December 2009, the Neckar-Alb Railway is also served by long distance services. From Mondays to Fridays an InterCity service runs at 06:11 from T√ºbingen with stops in Reutlingen, Metzingen and N√ºrtingen and Plochingen via Stuttgart to D√ºsseldorf and Berlin. Services to D√ºsseldorf (IC 2010) and Berlin (IC 2011) reach their destinations in the evening and IC 1915 reaches T√ºbingen, from Mondays to Thursdays, at 19:50, and, on Sundays, at 21:50.Schnuppern bei IC-Verbindung, accessed 24 March 2011 This link is a trial limited to two years. =Freight = During Deutsche Bahn‚Äôs ‚Äúmarket-oriented freight supply‚Äù reform program (MORA C), Hohenzollerische Landesbahn (HzL) took over all freight transport between T√ºbingen and Plochingen, previously operated by Railion, in 2002. Despite considerable demand, HzL retired from this business after several years of disagreement over the access charges incurred for its services. Since then, the T√ºbingen freight yard is only regularly served towards the west, with a few exceptions, such as for the storage of track maintenance trains. The only regular freight runs between Plochingen and Wendlingen am Neckar (and from there via the Teck Railway to Oberlenningen) and between Plochingen and N√ºrtingen (and from there via the T√§les Railway to Neuffen). Freight also runs from Plochingen to Metzingen (from there on the Erms Valley Railway via Dettingen an der Erms to Bad Urach). Plans to transport waste from the districts of T√ºbingen and Reutlingen to the Stuttgart-M√ºnster Incinerator by rail have been abandoned. The city of Reutlingen has secured the site of the former freight depot so that a container terminal can be built there.http://agmannheim.de/servlet/PB/menu/1240974/index.html?ROOT=1153033 Because of the temporary closure of the Rhine Valley Railway in 2017 due to the collapse of the Rastatt Tunnel, many freight trains were diverted via T√ºbingen‚ÄìHorb and some regional trains were cancelled. =Rollingstock= *IRE: trains hauled by class 612 locomotives (Aulendorf‚ÄìStuttgart, Rottenburg‚ÄìStuttgart), class 110 locomotives + four Silberling carriages (only between T√ºbingen and Stuttgart) *RE: class 143 locomotives or class 111 locomotives with five double-deck carriages and a class 612 hauled train *RB: class 650 diesel multiple units (Herrenberg‚ÄìPlochingen, Herrenberg‚ÄìBad Urach), one service operated with class 110 locomotives + Silberling carriages (Plochingen‚ÄìT√ºbingen) and class 426 electric multiple units (Plochingen‚ÄìN√ºrtingen) Planning  For several years discussion have been under way on plans to integrate the Plochingen‚ÄìWendlingen‚ÄìN√ºrtingen‚ÄìReutlingen‚ÄìT√ºbingen line together with other regional lines (Ammer Valley Railway, Erms Valley Railway, Swabian Alb Railway, Zollernalb Railway and the Upper Neckar Railway) into the Neckar-Alb Regional Stadtbahn on the Karlsruhe model. As part of Stuttgart 21, it is planned to connect the Neckar-Alb Railway via the Little Wendlingen Curve (Kleine Wendlinger Kurve) to the Wendlingen‚ÄìUlm high-speed railway. This will cut travel times from T√ºbingen to Stuttgart Flughafen/Messe station at Stuttgart Airport in half and reduce travel time to the Stuttgart Hauptbahnhof by 4 minutes.www.das-neue-herz-europas.de From 2020 on, Abellio will operate the services between Stuttgart and T√ºbingen with slower services only between Wendlingen and Reutlingen. Fare zones  Between Stuttgart Hauptbahnhof and Bempflingen, fares on the line runs are coordinated by the Transport and Tariff Association of Stuttgart (Verkehrs- und Tarifverbund Stuttgart, VVS). Between Bempflingen and T√ºbingen, they are coordinated by the Neckar-Alb- Danube Transport Association (Verkehrsverbund Neckar-Alb-Donau, Naldo).

The two brothers were insolvent and owed the company money, but were out of South Australian jurisdiction (G. T. Bean being in England and W. H. Bean in Melbourne). Among the causes for the company's collapse was W. H. Bean's unauthorised purchases on company cheques (speculating on chaff for instance). Nor had W. H. Bean maintained the books properly.

Built on a 60-acre site, it is the largest desalination plant in India. Construction works were carried out by the Indian company IVRCL and the Spanish company Abengoa, under the direction of the Project Manager Fernando Portillo Vall√©s and the Construction Manager Juan Ignacio Jim√©nez-Velasco, who returned to Europe after the inauguration of the plant to work on Renewable Energy Projects. Originally scheduled to be operational by January 2009, the work on the plant was delayed due to Cyclone Nisha in October 2008, which damaged a portion of the completed marine works and destroyed the cofferdam meant for the installation of transition pipes. The trial runs were completed in June 2010 and the plant was opened in July 2010. Water from the plant will be utilised chiefly for industrial purposes such as the Ennore Port and North Chennai Thermal Power Station. However, during droughts, water from the plant will be supplied to the public, serving an estimated population of 1,000,000. Water scarcity in the city Being a city that depends extensively on ground water, replenished by an average annual rainfall of 1,276 mm, Chennai experiences a chronic water problem. The city receives about 985 Million- Liters-per-Day (MLD) of water from ground and surface water sources, against the demand of 1,200 MLD. Due to an increased usage of groundwater, underground aquifers are being depleted at a rapid rate. By 2031, the demand is expected to increase to about 2,700 MLD. To alleviate the freshwater problems, the state government decided to implement desalination of sea water. Initially, a 100 MLD plant was planned at Minjur, followed by another plant with equal capacity at Nemmeli. A third plant with a capacity of 200 MLD has been planned at Pattipulam, south of Nemmeli. Chennai Water Desalination Limited Chennai Water Desalination Ltd. (CWDL) is a special purpose vehicle of IVRCL Infrastructure & Projects Ltd. and Befesa Agua of Spain, created in 2005 to design, build, own and operate the seawater desalination plant for the Chennai Metro Water Supply and Sewerage Board (CMWSSB). In September 2005, the CMWSSB signed a bulk water purchase agreement with CWDL to purchase water from the plant at a cost of 48.66/m¬≥ (US$1.03/m¬≥). The water to industries is sold at a rate of 60/m¬≥ (US$1.27/m¬≥). At the end of the 25-year agreement, the plant will be transferred to the state government. With an installed capacity to produce 100 million liters of drinking water per day, it is the largest such plant in India. Commercial operations began on 25 July 2010, and average production has been 90 MLD. With Chennai being a burgeoning metropolis with an unfulfilled requirement of nearly 400 MLD of water, this project is the first among a series of desalination plants being planned in the state to meet the deficit in supply. Operations Reverse osmosis (RO) technology is employed at the plant to desalinate the sea water, which contains up to 6.4 ppm aluminium and about 50 NTU of turbidity. Energy recovery units help increase the efficiency of the system by recovering kinetic energy from the brine solution and transferring the same to the desalinated water that has passed through the osmotic membrane. Pre-treatment of the raw sea water includes coagulation-flocculation, gravity, and pressure filtration. The filtered water is then pumped to the plant where it undergoes various preliminary treatments before being passed through the RO trains. The water is then forced through the RO membranes at high pressure. The membranes retain the salts and pass on the desalinated water to the next stage, namely, the post-treatment process. The treated water is then flavoured and stored in a 20 MLD underground water tank, from where it is pumped to the Red Hills reservoir and then released into the city grid. The RO technology of the plant produces 100 MLD of desalinated water from 273 MLD of sea water. Components The plant consists of 8,600 sea water reverse osmosis (RO) membranes, 248 pressure vessels, 115 pressure exchangers, 5 high-pressure pumps, 16 pressure filter vessels, electrical, automation and control systems and 1,200 m of HDPE pipelines of 1,600 mm diameter. The CMWSSB laid a 33 km pipeline at a cost of 930 million (US$20 million) to carry the treated fresh water from Minjur to Red Hills. The project also included infrastructure for the collection of seawater, including a 110 kV/22 kV sub-station built by the Tamil Nadu Electricity Board for uninterrupted power supply to the desalination plant. Before construction of the plant, studies were also conducted on the environmental impact on the livelihoods of fishermen and other communities and the impact of high saline discharge on the fisheries and turtle nesting. =Seawater intake system= A reinforced concrete cylindrical intake well of 5 m diameter and 4 m height has been installed nearly 600 m from the shore at a depth of 9 m. A stainless steel screen sits atop the well. The sea water intake pipeline enters the well at the bottom. The HDPE pipeline is 1,600 mm in diameter. It was welded using butt fusion welding machines on the shore before being floated out to the sea and being sunk along the required alignment. The pipeline empties the water into a sea water intake sump on the shore where 3 vertical turbine pumps of variable discharge up to a maximum of 4,000 cum/hr each are used to pump water into the plant. The average intake flow is 9,000 to 10,000 cum/hr, and the average product water output of the plant is about 4,000 cum/hr. The system is designed to work as a self-priming suction for sea water intake. The plant also has 5 additional intake lines of 560 mm OD as a stand-by intake system. These pipelines have a separate pump house where centrifugal pumps of discharge up to a maximum of 1,500 cum/hr each have been installed. The marine works subcontract (involving laying of the intake pipelines, intake structures and outfall pipeline) was executed by Flowline Systems Pvt Ltd. Cost Chennai Metrowater purchases water from the plant for 48.66 per kilolitre of water in accordance with the bulk water purchase agreement with Chennai Water Desalination Limited, a special purpose vehicle promoted by IVRCL. The tariff is high compared to the plant at Nemmeli since the company that has set up the plant also has to add in capital and operations costs. As of 2019, the plant caters to 1 million residents in North Chennai.

Life Golightly was born on 23 May 1807, the second son of William Golightly of Ham, Surrey, gentleman, by his wife, Frances Dodd. His mother's mother, Aldegunda, was granddaughter of Charles de Pourtal√®s, 'a distinguished member of an ancient and honourable Huguenot family.' He was educated at Eton College. In his youth he travelled in Europe, visited Rome, seeing there 'a good deal of certain cardinals, and entering into their characters and their politics.' He matriculated 4 March 1824 at Oriel College, Oxford, where he proceeded as B.A. in 1828, M.A. in 1830. His attainments would have justified his election to a fellowship, but as his private property was thought to be a disqualification he took curacies at Penshurst, Kent, and afterwards at Godalming, Surrey. In 1836, when the chapel of Littlemore, near Oxford, was almost finished, it was suggested that Golightly's means would enable him to take it without an endowment. Golightly entered into the scheme with enthusiasm, and bought one of the curious old houses in Holywell Street, Oxford. A single sermon led, however, to a disagreement with John Henry, later Cardinal Newman, the then vicar of St. Mary's, Oxford, to which Littlemore had been an adjunct, and their official connection, though they had been acquaintances from early youth, at once ceased. In this house he remained for the rest of his life, keenly interested in church matters, and struggling against the spread of what he deemed Romanism. For some time he was curate of Headington; he held the miserably endowed vicarage of Baldon Toot, and he occasionally officiated in the church of St. Peter in the East, Oxford, for Hamilton, afterwards bishop of Salisbury. He was a thorough student of theology and history. His religious views were those of Hooker, and he gloried in the traditions of the old high church party, but his hatred of Romanism, deepened by his Huguenot descent, made him a fierce opponent of ritualism. Even opponents admitted his deep religious feelings and his frank fearlessness. He was friendly with men of every division of thought, and his charity was unbounded and unostentatious. He was full of anecdote, heightened by much dryness of wit, and was always accessible. For the last three years of his life he was haunted by painful illusions, and his death was a release from pain. He died on Christmas Day 1885, and was buried in Holywell cemetery, near Magdalen College, Oxford. Edward Meyrick Goulburn, dean of Norwich reprinted, 'with additions and a preface, from the \\"Guardian\\" of 13 Jan. 1886' his reminiscences of Golightly. An auction catalogue of his furniture and library was issued in February 1886. Works All his publications were controversial. They comprise: * 'Look at Home, or a Short and Easy Method with the Roman Catholics,‚Äô 1837. * 'Letter to the Bishop of Oxford, containing Strictures upon certain parts of Dr. Pusey's Letter to his Lordship.

This publication had its origin in an article in the Quarterly Review for January 1858, in which the practices at Cuddesdon College were criticised. At a meeting in the Sheldonian Theatre, Oxford, on 22 Nov. 1861, an anonymous handbill, written by Golightly in condemnation of the teaching in the middle class schools connected with St. Nicholas College, Lancing, was distributed. Some reflections were then made upon it by Francis Jeune, the vice-chancellor, and this provoked: * 'A Letter to the Rev. Dr. Jeune, in vindication of the Handbill by Rev. C. P. Golightly,‚Äô 1861. A second letter to Dr. Jeune, 1861. Still undaunted, he wrote: * 'The position of Bishop Wilberforce in reference to Ritualism, together with a Prefatory Account of the Romeward Movement in the Church of England in the days of Archbishop Laud.

In the same year (1878) Golightly reissued in separate form, and with his name, his 'Brief Account of Romeward Movement in Days of Laud.' The attack on Cuddesdon College was the subject of pp. 358‚Äì66, 415‚Äì18, vol. ii. of the 'Life of Bishop Wilberforce,‚Äô and Golightly retorted with 'A Letter to the Very Reverend the Dean of Ripon, containing Strictures on the Life of Bishop Wilberforce,‚Äô 1881.

Life The descendant of a Pembrokeshire family living at Prickeston, he was eldest son of Roger Lort, major of the Royal Welsh Fusiliers, who married Anne, only child of Edward Jenkins, vicar of Fareham, Hampshire. His father died at Cambrai, 11 May 1745, aged 51, from wounds received at the battle of Fontenoy; his mother died in 1767, aged 69, and in 1778 he erected a monument to their memory, now on the east wall of the chapel of St. Ann in Tenby Church. He entered Trinity College, Cambridge, on 13 June 1743, when he was described as aged 18 and as coming from Tenby school. William Cole adds that he was at Westminster School. His degrees at Cambridge were, B.A. 1746, M.A. 1750, B.D. 1761, and D.D. 1780. He was incorporated at Oxford 7 July 1759. His college offices were: scholar 20 April 1744, sub-fellow 2 Oct. 1749, full fellow 4 July 1750, senior fellow 1768, sublector primus 1753, Latin reader 1754, lector primarius 1755, and Greek reader 1756. On graduating in 1746, Lort acted as librarian to Richard Mead until 1754. His preferments were numerous, but for many years not very lucrative. From 1759 to 1771 he held the post of Regius Professor of Greek at Cambridge, and in 1768 he applied for the professorship of modern history, when Thomas Gray was given the chair. In 1761 he was appointed chaplain to Richard Terrick, bishop of Peterborough, and about that date he served the vicarage of Bottisham, near Cambridge. From 1779 to 1783 he lived at Lambeth Palace as domestic chaplain to Archbishop Frederick Cornwallis. He was promoted to be librarian at Lambeth in 1785, and he is said to have been librarian to the Duke of Devonshire. In January 1771 he became rector of St. Matthew, Friday Street, London. On 11 April 1780 he was collated to the prebendal stall of Tottenhall in St. Paul's Cathedral (which caused him to vacate his fellowship at Trinity College on Lady day 1781); he obtained in 1789 the rectory of St. Michael, Mile End, adjoining Colchester; and Bishop Beilby Porteus gave him in April 1789 the sinecure rectory of Fulham. Lort was elected Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in 1755, remaining a vice-president until 1788, and became Fellow of the Royal Society in 1766. While driving down North Hill, Colchester, in August 1790, Lort was thrown out of his carriage, and he died from the effects of the accident at 6 Savile Row, London, 5 November 1790. He had married, in May 1783, Susannah Norfolk one of the two daughters of Alderman Norfolk of Cambridge. She died on 5 February 1792, aged 50, and was buried in the same vault with her husband in the church of Friday Street, a white marble tablet being placed on its north wall. On the demolition of the building the remains were removed in 1883 to the City of London cemetery at Ilford. Works He published little, but helped others. He printed a couple of sermons (1760 and 1770), edited in 1769 A Projecte conteyning the State of Governmente of the University of Cambridge, in the 43d year of the raigne of Queen Elizabeth, in 1785 had ‚Äòa copy of the Alexandrian New Testament printed off on fine vellum,‚Äô and in 1790 published A Short Commentary on the Lord's Prayer, from which Granville Sharp in 1806 took the observations on the last two petitions as an appendix to his own work on that subject. John Carter the architect obtained his ‚Äòfirst insight and encouragement‚Äô from him. Some of his manuscript lives were used by Alexander Chalmers in his Biographical Dictionary. James Granger obtained his aid in his portrait-dictionary, he assisted John Nichols in the Gentleman's Magazine and in other undertakings, and he contributed to Arch√¶ologia. Letters to and from him and Cole, Thomas Percy, and Horace Walpole are in Nichols's Literary Anecdotes, and Illustrations of Literary History, and there are some letters and notes from him in Granger's Letters. Lort's English verses from the Gratulatio Academi√¶ Cantabrigiensis, 1748, on the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle, are reprinted in Nichols's Collection of Poems, and another English poem by him is in Thomas Zouch's Works. The Greek verses in four collections of the University of Cambridge (1760‚Äì63) which bear Lort's name are reprinted in Zouch's Works (by whom it appears that they were written). His notes on the authorship of the Whole Duty of Man are in Nichols's Literary Anecdotes, and his vindication of Horace Walpole with respect to Thomas Chatterton is in the Illustrations of Literary History. His books were sold from 5 April to 14 May 1791, and produced ¬£1,269, and his prints, which were disposed of on 26 May and six following days, fetched ¬£401.

It covers the municipalities of Areatza, Artea, Orozko, Zeberio, and Zeanuri in Vizcaya and Zigoitia, Zuia and Urkabustaiz in √Ålava. Gorbea Natural Park, along with the nearby natural park of Urkiola, form an important environmental unit. Natural Park was declared by the Basque Government Decree on 21 June 1994 with the purpose of protecting their natural heritage while promoting rural development, understanding and enjoyment. It takes its name from its highest peak, the Gorbea (Gorbeia or Gorbeiagane in Euskera) of . Other peaks of interest are Aldamin Pe√±a of and the Pe√±as de Itxina. Borda  Communications and access to the park  Access to Gorbea Park is based on the national highway N-240 linking Bilbao to Vitoria, which surrounds the park to the east. To the west it is surrounded by the AP-68, which also links Bilbao and Vitoria and local roads, such as BI-2522 and A-624. The BI-3513 county of Orozco Artea] allows access to the north and the N -622 in the south. The bus service linking Bilbao and Vitoria, or Barazar Altube, is another means of access to the park.  Interpretive centers  There are two interpretation centres: one in the Alava, near the town of Sarria and another in the town of Villaro or Areatza in Vizcaya. There information can be found about the Natural Park as well as an exhibition that describes the characteristics of the park.  Mount Gorbea, the heart of the park  Gorbea Natural Park is formed around Mount Gorbea, and the peaks surrounding it. The summit of above sea level is a fundamental reference of the inhabitants of Alava and Vizcaya. For the Basques the Gorbea has been one of the mountains bocineros of which are calling for General Meetings. The summit of the mountain is surmounted by a cross of in height (the first that was installed was and the second ) installed in the early twentieth century and has become a symbol for all Basques coming to form part of popular culture. Gorbea summit  Climate  The altitude of Gorbea Natural Park gives it a typical mountain climate, and acts as a major barrier to stop the wet winds from the Gulf of Biscay, with substantive differences between the northern, more humid, and the south, dry and sunny. Rainfall is abundant, present in all months of the year, although the fall and winter months are the rainy seasons. In general, are higher than / year in the northern slope, which may exceed in the summit. On the south side down to about rainfall about / year. The average annual temperature between in the valleys Basques to in higher areas. Precipitation in these latter areas is in the form of snow during the winter months, which remains until early spring. The difference in precipitation and temperatures between the area of Vizcaya and Alava are evident in various aspects such as flora or geology. Due to the effect more of the abundant rains are in the northern part of the massif and the southern part is characterized by a climate of Continental influence.  Geology and geomorphology  Geologically Gorbeia is mostly composed of sedimentary rocks. They have been created by erosion processes whose sediments were transported inland sea and then lithified (the process by which sediments are transformed into a compact rock.) . The park is known for its rocky surroundings. Formations as the Eye of Atxular or Atxular Itxina in karst and the cave in √Ålava Mairuelegorreta accidents are the most notable. In the park there are two types of substrates: Silica forms of landscape originates rounded, dark tones and lush vegetation. Gorbea summit is a good example. Limestone: light- colored surfaces and rocky, limestone areas are characterized by the presence of cracks, potholes and depressions. There are 500 chambers listed in the Park, of which the cave and Supelegor Mairuelegorreta are most popular. In the limestone karst highlight Itxina complex, which evolved over Urgonian extracts (characteristics of the limestone) that have caused one of the best examples of forms of Euskal Herria kartice. The hydrography of Gorbea, which pours into the Mediterranean and Cantabrian consists of small rivers that should save a significant gap forming gullies and ravines. In the Mediterranean, which run to √Ålava, there is the Zubialde Bayas River, in the Cantabrian Altube, Arnuari, and Arratia Zeberio.  Flora and fauna  With regard to vegetation, the area holds important deciduous forests, especially in the aspect of Alava (Altube area). The tree that occupies the largest area with about 6,000 have been, but we also found robledades sessile oak and pedunculate oak, and sketches of Cantabrian holm oak and strawberry trees reveal that centuries ago the climate was much warmer. Alders, willows, ash, and poplars are increasingly rare riparian forests found to shelter species of great interest. The conifers, mostly exotic species planted for forestry, occupy much of the Park's area, among the most representative of these plantations are insignis and radiata pine (Pinus radiata), Lawson cypress and the black pine (Pinus nigra). Excessive logging that occurred since the eighteenth century intended for work in the foundries, shipbuilding and papermaking even led to the provincial council to decree that the repopulation of the cleared areas, would be done with commercial species. There is a large representation of species of fauna, forest raptors (hawk, hawk, eagle toed) and rup√≠colas (peregrine falcon, Egyptian vulture), mammals (bobcat, deer, polecats, martens, marten and dormouse). The ponds and wetlands are home to a good representation of amphibians (Alpine newt and frog agile). Carrion vultures have the Park as part of its territory but do not nest in it, they come from the nearby Parque Natural de la Sierra Urkiola and Saved and Valderejo Natural Park.  Places to visit  Otzarreta forest. There are many landscapes that are worth visiting, but the best known are: Cruz del Gorbea, Itxina Karst, The meadows of Araba, Mairuelegorreta cave, waterfall and wetland Gujuli Saldropo, Otzarreta forest.  Population  In the park there are no inhabited areas but there is a scattered population living in villages, there is a seasonal population, pastoralists, living in shacks during pasture season. The small towns surrounding the park are home to some 9,000 people and its economy is founded on farms, herds of latxa sheep, cattle and horses, and forestry. Subsistence agriculture is the sale of surplus in the markets of the regions concerned. Population history of the occupation The first humans of which there is evidence in the park territories date back to 100,000 years before Christ, in the Middle Paleolithic, five teeth of a Neanderthal have been found and identified. No evidence was found for the occupation of cromangones and is believed to be due to harsh weather in the Upper Paleolithic period in the cave. Similar Arrillor lithic remains of Magdalenian type in the cave were found relating to Bolinkoba piety, antlers and bones with geometric prints. Mesolithic finds in the cave there Urratxa III belonging to the so-called culture Azilian. They built the largest Neolithic stone monuments, normally for funerary use. The dolmens and barrows are easy to observe structures within the park. More than 10 dolmens and burial mounds are located in the current grazing areas. The isolation of these territories means the influence of historical movements have been minimal. The life forms of Neolithic pastoralism have remained unchanged to the present. Only the occupation of some isolated settlements of farmers has allowed a change in the historical record. This has favored the conservation delentorno with the values that have and are currently protected. Unlike neighboring Urquiola Natural Park, which has historically been an important route of communication, Gorbea has remained outside, keeping the traditional ways of life until the advent of technological revolutions succeeded in making a dent in them. Therefore, traditional buildings, such as water mills, predator, refrigerators and evidence of the coal industry are now beautifully preserved, one of its main actrativos, along with the natural course. The main activity that has historically been developed in the territories that make up the park is grazing. This activity was completed by the manufacture of lime, by firing limestone kilns, charcoal making and the manufacture of ice in a refrigerator. Of these the only activity that remains is that of grazing, and the remains of its other facilities are used to develop a new source of wealth for the area, urban tourism. Gorbea Natural Park has become a place to which people flock from nearby urban areas, especially in Bilbao and Vitoria, for sports and leisure activities. In the park there are about 13 chapels, the most important of which is the shrine of Our Lady of the Snows. During the mid-twentieth century Club Deportivo de Bilbao Egiri√±ao built a shelter. In an area like the land surrounding the Gorbea, where outside influences have been reluctant to enter, the mythology has been kept alive in its residents. There is the main goddess Mari, the Lady of Anboto, whose house is seen from many parts of the park, and the forests are inhabited by the Basajaun and on the banks of the river, the ladies with flippers, the Lamiak.

It was registered as a \\"Historic Place ‚Äì Category I\\" by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust. It was \\"damaged beyond the point of repair\\" in the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake and was demolished the following September. History The original Avonside Church in ca 1857 The 1876 part of the church, designed by Mountfort, collapsed while repairs were under way The Parish of the Most Holy Trinity Avonside was established in 1855, with the first service held in the Rev. Charles Mackie's home \\"Stricklands\\". The first service was held in a church building designed by Charles Edward Fooks and made of cob at Christmas Day 1855, but the church was only consecrated on 24 February 1857; it was the first Anglican church in Canterbury consecrated by Bishop Harper. The land for the church had been provided by John and Elizabeth Stace, who had arrived in Lyttelton on the Nugent in 1851. Architect Benjamin Mountfort, a parishioner, designed additions to the church including a bell tower and timber vestry in 1869. Around 1873, further Mountfort-designed additions included a stone chancel and transepts. In 1905 the original cob building was replaced by a stone nave designed by Mountfort's son Cyril Mountfort. In 1953‚Äì1954 the west end of the church was extended, removing the remaining pre-1870s part of the building. The church received damage in the 2010 Canterbury earthquake. Repairs were under way when the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake struck, when the church building suffered major damage including collapse of the chancel and most of the transepts. The church was \\"damaged beyond the point of repair\\". Workers repairing damage on the inside of the 1876 Mountfort-designed part of the church were having lunch outside when this part of the building collapsed. The church was demolished in September 2011 amidst much controversy. Heritage advocates claimed that the church was of higher importance than ChristChurch Cathedral and more should have been done to try and save it, or it should have at least been dismantled by hand to save important architectural features like the ceilings, but instead diggers smashed everything up. Bishop Victoria Matthews defended the demolition, stating that her \\"priority has to be humans and the safety of the community. It wasn't the time to take chances.\\" A time capsule containing the words of the consecration was recovered from underneath the nave.

She is based in Bristol Harbour at M Shed (formerly Bristol Industrial Museum). She is the oldest Bristol-built ship afloat and is believed to be the oldest surviving tug in the world.Steam tug Mayflower 1861 by A. King, Bristol Museums & Art Gallery 1990  History  She was built by GK Stothert & Co, who were connected with the Bath-based engineering company Stothert & Pitt. A branch of the family came to Bristol to build railway locomotives (later to become the Avonside Engine Company). After 1852, a separate shipbuilding company was established which survived in business until the 1930s. Mayflower was built to work on the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal and in the River Severn, one of three tugs ordered after trials had shown they were much more efficient than horses. Altogether they cost ¬£3000. Mayflower started working between Sharpness and Gloucester Docks, towing trains of small sailing vessels such as trows and ketches, and, after the new docks at Sharpness were completed in 1874, larger steamers one at a time. By the late 1890s she was the most seaworthy tug in the fleet, and she was altered to make her suitable for work in the Bristol Channel. The old single-cylinder engine was replaced in 1899 with a vertical compound condensing engine supplied, along with a new boiler, funnel, propeller and shafting by W.Sisson & Co. of Gloucester for ¬£940. The steering position, which had previously been behind the funnel, was moved forward, and a waist high iron steering shelter added to give the skipper some comfort. She went back to work outside Sharpness, towing sailing vessels through the dangerous stretches of the Severn Estuary to the mouth of the river Wye and back again. Around 1907, the Canal Company decided to compete on the River Severn upstream of Gloucester to Worcester. In 1909 Mayflower was again altered when the funnel was arranged to hinge down (counterbalanced with large weights which can still be seen) to enable her to pass under the fixed bridges on this stretch of water. She was now capable of working on every part of the navigation from Worcester to Chepstow, and because of this, became regarded as the training tug in the canal's fleet, which she continued to be until the end of her working life. In 1922, she was again altered when the entire deck was raised by which meant that the area beneath the deck at the stern could become another cabin albeit with very low headroom. At the same time the bulwarks were cut away down most of each side and replaced with stanchions and chains; this reflected the increased barge traffic on the canal, allowing the crew to step onto laden barges easily. In the late 1930s, a wooden wheelhouse replaced the steering shelter, and some time after this the bulwarks were replaced. In 1948 the British Waterways Board took control of the canal and made efforts to modernise the tug fleet. All the tugs were either scrapped or had diesel engines installed, except Mayflower, as she was too old to be worth bothering with. She was given the job of 'mudding tug' ‚Äì towing the mud hopper barges filled by the canal dredger to the discharge point. Sometimes she was needed to turn ships at Sharpness Docks and assist them in the entrance lock. In 1962‚Äì1963, when the winter was so cold that the canal froze and the diesel tugs had difficulty in working, Mayflower once again took on ship-towing work in the canal. Finally, British Waterways sold Mayflower for scrap in 1967. She was saved from being cut up for scrap metal by Anthony H Barrett Great Wyrley who at the time was setting out in his business career and regularly attended auction sales throughout the UK. Mayflower had been purchased by an auction ring which Barrett Great Wyrley had to join if he stood any chance of acquiring it. Barrett Great Wyrley who was the highest bidder in that 'ring' and he purchased the tug for a sum of ¬£400, borrowing the money to pay for her from his older cousin, George Billingham. A consortium was then formed to fund the purchase, and Barrett Great Wyrley was joined by Kevin Donaghy and Len Sanford, two Walsall engineers. All three men took a third share in Mayflower and agreed to share the expenses of keeping her moored at Gloucester Docks. Barrett Great Wyrley, who was around 20 yrs old at the time, was already involved in the restoration of vintage Rolls Royce motors and it was he that saw the importance of preserving Mayflower for posterity. Barrett Great Wyrley wrote to many people and organisations, including Prince Charles who was going through his investiture at this time, in his endeavour to find assistance in preserving the vessel, to no avail. In the late seventies the two other investors pulled out after some vandals went aboard in the night and opened the 'water cocks', in effect scuttling the boat, which went to the bottom of the dock. This event cost the consortium in excess of ¬£1400 to re-float the boat. Barrett Great Wyrley continued alone until 1981 when, because of a financial crisis, he decided he too must pull out and let someone else take over as custodian. Barrett Great Wyrley and the two other men had done their very best to maintain the tug often under difficult circumstances in the fourteen years they were custodians of her. In 1981 she was offered for auction by Charles Phillips Auctioneers from outside Barrett Great Wyrley's home at Sneyd Farm Essington, which is when she was purchased by Bristol Museums & Art Gallery and towed back to her birthplace. Over the next six years Mayflower was restored to working order by a team of volunteers, and she steamed again in 1987. Early in 1988, she steamed back to Gloucester on a courtesy visit. Mayflower regularly steams during the summer months carrying visitors on trips in Bristol Harbour. She marked her 150th anniversary in May 2011.

The earthquake had an estimated magnitude of at least 8.4 on the moment magnitude scale, but may have been as high as 9.0, similar to the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami. The tsunami caused widespread flooding of the Sendai plain. In 2001, researchers identified sand deposits in a trench more than from the coast as coming from this tsunami. Name In Japan this earthquake is commonly called \\"Jogan Jishin(Ë≤ûË¶≥Âú∞Èúá)\\". J≈çgan is the Japanese era name for the period from 859 to 877 AD. But during the era other large earthquakes also occurred in Japan, so the name of the geographic epicenter and the anno domini year number when the quake occurred are sometimes added. Sanriku in this context is a name roughly corresponding to the Pacific front northeastern coastal area of Honshu island. The Japanese history text, Nihon Sandai Jitsuroku which was compiled in 901, recorded the 869 earthquake and tsunami of Mutsu Province. Description in public archives Although this earthquake occurred in the frontier region of the ancient Japanese Empire based at Kyoto, a short and precise official record of this catastrophe was left. The description in Nihon Sandai Jitsuroku [True History of Three Reigns of Japan] (901) reads as follows: Tectonic setting The northern part of Honshu lies above the convergent boundary between the over-riding Okhotsk Plate (a proposed microplate within the North American Plate) and the subducting Pacific Plate. This boundary has been associated with a series of large historical earthquakes, originating either from rupture along the plate interface or from deformation within either the over-riding or subducting plates, many of them triggering a destructive tsunami, such as the 1896 Sanriku earthquake. Damage In the area which the earthquake struck, the Imperial Court of Japan battled with an indigenous people of the T≈çhoku region, Emishi, at that time. According to Nihon Sandai Jitsuroku, around 1000 people were killed by the tsunami. There are legends about the earthquake from T≈çhoku region to B≈çs≈ç Peninsula. The tsunami caused extensive flooding of the Sendai plain, determined to have reached at least inland, destroying the town of Tagaj≈ç and its castle. Archaeological investigations have identified the remains of 8th and 9th century buildings beneath the town, covered by sediments dated to the middle of the 10th century. Characteristics =Earthquake= The estimated magnitude of the earthquake as 8.6 on the surface wave magnitude scale, has been taken from modelling of the tsunami. A source area of long by wide with a displacement of is consistent with the observed distribution and degree of flooding. Analysis of the tsunami deposits associated with the 2011 earthquake suggests that the extent of sand deposition in the earlier events underestimated the degree of inundation. A muddy deposit was found to extend half as far again as the sand sheet. As the topography and cultivation of the Sendai plain has not changed significantly since 869, it has been proposed that the sources of the 2011 and 869 tsunamis were of comparable size, suggesting that the magnitude of the 869 earthquake has been severely underestimated. Thus the magnitude of this quake may have been as high as 9.0. =Tsunami= The extent of flooding caused by the tsunami of the Sendai plain has been mapped using dated deposits of sand. The tsunami flooded at least inland. The inundated areas closely matched those of the 2011 T≈çhoku tsunami.Yoshida, Reiji, \\"869 Tohoku tsunami parallels stun\\", Japan Times, 11 March 2012, p. 1. Predicted earthquake hazard Three tsunami deposits have been identified within the Holocene sequence of the Sendai plain, all formed within the last 3,000 years, suggesting an 800 to 1,100-year recurrence interval for large tsunamigenic earthquakes. In 2001 it was reckoned that there was a high likelihood of a large tsunami hitting the Sendai plain, as more than 1,100 years had then elapsed. As for the other two large tsunamis recognized before the 869 tsunami, one was estimated to have occurred between about 1000 BC and 500 BC and the other around 1 AD.http://www.jishin.go.jp/main/chousakenkyuu/miyagi_juten/h18/h18_miyagi.pdf (p. 68) In 2007, the probability of an earthquake with a magnitude of 8.1‚Äì8.3 was estimated as 99% within the following 30 years. The 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake occurred in exactly the same area as the 869 earthquake, fulfilling the earlier prediction and causing major flooding in the Sendai area.

Despite its progress, the African continent's IDP populations continue to be high‚Äî accounting for a third of the global IDP population. Critics, scholars, and international organizations point to less-than-substantial emphasis of effective implementation by ratifying states. Consideration of special populations and women has also been called for by these groups.  History  The situation and presence of internally displaced persons (IDPs) is not a recent occurrence in human history, but rather due to societal factors gained a larger audience after the Cold War. Dieng, A. (2017). Protecting internally displaced persons: The value of the Kampala Convention as a regional example. International Review of the Red Cross, 99(904), 263-282. The experience and protection of internally displaced persons varies widely from those groups and individuals deemed refugees. In contrast to refugees, IDPs do not receive support from the United Nations High Commissioner of Refugees (UNHCR), and there is no comparable agency that accommodates the needs of these individuals. Guistiniani, F. Z. (2010). New hopes and challenges for the protection of IDPs in Africa: The Kampala convention for the protection and assistance of internally displaced persons in Africa. Denv. J. Int'l L. & Pol'y, 39, 347. Many past forced migration organization efforts in Africa and internationally substantially influenced the Kampala Convention‚Äî including the 1969 Organization of African Unity Convention Governing the Specific Aspects of Refugee Problems in Africa and the 1998 Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement developed by the United Nations. The Guiding Principles have inspired and guided similarly focused regulations crafted by entities at the regional and national levels worldwide. These remain the major framework for protection of internally displaced persons globally. In 2011, prior to the signing of this treaty, close to 10 million people were estimated to be internally displaced persons across sub-Saharan Africa. This number represented over half of the population of internally displaced persons in the World with the largest number in 2011 residing in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Maru, M. T. (2011). The Kampala Convention and its Contribution in Filling the Protection Gap in International Law. Journal of Internal Displacement, 1(1), 91-130. Chicago. Several states within the African continent, including Democratic Republic of the Congo, Sudan, and Somalia, are among the five nations with the largest displacement situations globally.

Specifically, the Darfur region of Sudan was of special interest in the consideration of the situation of internally displaced persons in that region of Africa. Duchatellier, M., & Phuong, C. (2014). The African contribution to the protection of internally displaced persons: A commentary on the 2009 Kampala Convention. In Research Handbook on International Law and Migration. Edward Elgar Publishing. The primary factor that most of these displacement situations can be attributed to is violence, which can further be related to histories of colonialism, external intervention, and social and physical conflicts within states. Development is one of the rising factors contributing to internal displacement within the African region‚Äî being attributable to more of the situations of internal displacement than war. In 2012, the number of displaced individuals was greater than the refugee global total. Additionally, internally displaced persons are very often subject to increased influence by militia or armed forces groups. Groth, L. (2011). Engendering protection: An analysis of the 2009 Kampala Convention and its provisions for internally displaced women. International Journal of Refugee Law, 23(2), 221-251. Kismayo, Somalia, in 2014. Environmental factors and anthropogenic climate change have significantly altered the lives of IDPs in Africa. Environmental factors, and their impact on human populations, are particularly pronounced in Africa, although it is the area of the World with the least contribution to anthropogenic climate change. dos Santos Soares, A. (2018). Protecting environmentally displaced persons under the Kampala Convention: a brief assessment. Revista Catalana de Dret Ambiental, 9(1). Natural disasters have displaced more and more numbers of individuals every year. It was estimated that approximately 1 million individuals were displaced by natural disasters and occurrences in 2009‚Äî and close to 2 million were displaced the following year. The plight of individuals displaced by natural disaster is most greatly emphasized in the Horn of Africa. Drought is of particular concern. In Somalia alone, an estimated one and a half million individuals were displaced from their homes in 2011 due to drought. In 2012, it was estimated that over eight million people were newly displaced in Africa due to natural disasters. Close to six after the adoption of the Kampala Convention, in 2018, it was estimated that 16.7 million IDPs still existed in Africa‚Äî accounting for close to one-third of IDPs globally, a number estimated at that time to be approximately 40 million. Globally, the number of IDPs has been on the rise in recent years‚Äî doubling in the period from 2009‚Äì2018. Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre, (2019).

Further meetings in 2007 and 2008 finalized the official text, and in October 2009, the contents of the treaty were considered and adopted. Abebe, A. M. (2011, March).

Ojeda, S. (2010). The Kampala convention on internally displaced persons: Some international humanitarian law aspects. Refugee Survey Quarterly, 29(3), 58-66. The Convention explicitly links internal displacement specially in the fields of violence, war, human rights violations, and environmental depreciation. It heavily emphasizes the right of individuals to not be what the stakeholding parties deemed arbitrarily displaced individuals and groups‚Äî following the regular pattern of international law conformation in regards to justification of displacement, but also expanding upon regular rule here to include specific barring of the use of harmful practices and development projects as an explicit cause or justification of displacement. Adeola, R. (2018). The Kampala Convention and the right not to be arbitrarily displaced. Forced Migration Review, (59), 15-17. The document proceeds in the following sequential order‚Äî an overview of regulations and protections related to arbitrary displacement, protections given to IDPs throughout the process of displacement, and concludes with a delineation of solutions for the greater situation as a whole.

Forced Migration Review, (36), 62 = Key articles = The treaty includes provisions, specifically Article 3, detailing and expanding the rights of internally displaced persons mainly associated with climate change and factors relating to the environment. Through documents like the Convention, states hope to be able to reduce this by supporting systems, groups, and individuals aimed at advocating and serving the interests of IDPs.

It has been widely accepted that the Convention's terms, regulations, and definitions have greatly expanded upon formerly utilized and related legal documents and treaties, especially the 1998 Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement. Despite this, it was estimated in 2018 by the United Nations Higher Commission on Refugees that seven of the top ten countries with the highest IDP populations were in Africa. Many countries with large IDP populations, including Sudan, have not yet arrived at ratifying the Convention and/or implementing similar legislation and policy. United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, (2019, June 20). Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2018. UNHCR. https://www.unhcr.org/5d08d7ee7.pdf Lately, increased attention has been given to the issue of IDPs across the African continent. Official African Union conferences and workshops related to the Kampala Convention have taken place since 2016. This includes the Conference of States party to the Kampala Convention in Harare, Zimbabwe, occurring in 2017, resulting in the Harare Plan of Action‚Äî a guiding document for Convention implementation. Furthermore, in 2018 the AU adopted a ‚Äúmodel law‚Äù on the Convention, a document accessible by States and to be used in the drafting and formalization of domestic legislation and policies related to the Convention and its goals. Women and children line up outside a water distribution area in an IDP camp in Hiran, Somalia, in 2016. The implications of the Kampala treaty for women and special populations have recently been emphasized in scholarly and international organization analyses of the Convention. 2019 was designated by the African Union as the ‚ÄòYear of Refugees, Returnees, and Internally Displaced Persons‚Äô‚Äî with many states in recent years ratifying and becoming closer to ratifying the Convention and/or adopting similar domestic policies, and/or creating separate bodies to coordinate responses promoted by the Convention. It has also been further included and implicated in many important policy frameworks for the African continent, including the Migration Policy Framework for 2018-2030, and the Agenda 2063 framework produced by the AU in 2015.

United Nations. https://www.un.org/en/africa/osaa/pdf/au/agenda2063-framework.pdf = Criticism, debate = Although ratification of the Convention has occurred in most African Union states, questions related to the larger and more pivotal enforcement execution processes have been raised‚Äî including in nations such as Nigeria, in which over one million IDPs reside. Akpoghome, T. U. (2016). Internally Displaced Persons in Nigeria and the Kampala Convention. RiA Recht in Afrika Law in Africa Droit en Afrique, 18(1), 58-77. Reports generated by the International Committee for the Red Cross, focusing on the periods of 2016-2019 and emphasizing primarily domestic policy related to the Convention, have corroborated this as well‚Äî largely determining that most of the action taken by States since the adoption of the Convention have focused on prevention, framework-building, and management response, and less on data collection, enforcement, and implementation. In this light, emphasis on active engagement, interaction, and inclusion of IDP communities in the drafting, revision, and implementation of Convention policies has been put in place by legislation and frameworks enacted by several states that have ratified the Convention recently. Special populations face and continue to face many unique problems related to their status and condition. Scholarly studies and articles have concluded that women and children experience unique forms of hardship in the context of regional, national, and supranational conflict. Critics of the Kampala Convention and the African Union's action in this respect have pointed to restrictions and constraints in the field of equal protection under the Convention, especially considering a gendered view of this situation. The Norwegian Refugee Council has also echoed these sentiments‚Äî adding that full consideration and analytic and developmental measures should be taken by the States to ensure the women and girls benefit from the Convention, especially in the fields of housing and property ownership.

One of them, Tom Blake, was also a league footballer and distance runner of note.Sports Reference: George Blake Biography and Olympic Results Another, Mick Blake, also played in the VFL. In 1897, Blake made three appearances for St Kilda, in the inaugural VFL season. He played three more games in 1898 and then, due to his running career, had to wait five years for his seventh and final league game with St Kilda. He returned for the 1905 to play one more game, this time at Carlton. A national record holder for the 10 miles, Blake was one of Australia's leading long distance runners of the early 1900s and was a member of the East Melbourne Harriers Athletic Club. He went to Auckland in 1901 for the Australasian Championships and finished second in the three miles, but was the first placed Australian. He was one of just four Australians to go to Athens in 1906 for the Olympics. His first event was the Men's 1,500 metres where he finished far back in his heat and missed the final. The longer distances were more to his liking and in the Men's five mile race he placed sixth out of 28 competitors. Blake's best performance of the 1906 Games was in the Men's Marathon, where he was the only athlete from the southern hemisphere to compete. He was leading the race at the 24 km mark, by a distance of 1200 metres, but succumbed to cramp. Blake was still able to finish the race and finished sixth, in a time of three hours, nine minutes and thirty five seconds. He was involved in a sprint for the finish with Greece's Ioannis Alepous, who beat him to the line by ten seconds. His placing was not bettered by an Australian at an Olympic Games until Robert de Castella finished fifth in 1984.Although considered to be at the time, the 1906 Games are no longer recognised by the IOC as being an \\"Olympic\\" Games. They are instead referred to as the Intercalated Games, as they took place outside of the usual four year cycle. Blake made the long journey to Europe again two years later to participate in the London Olympics, this time competing for Australasia. He narrowly missed out on making the Men's Five Mile final after finishing third in his heat and only the top two qualified. In the marathon he couldn't repeats his performance from Athens and didn't finish the race.

It is dedicated to Anthony the Great, known as San Ant√≥n in Spanish. It is featured, along with the San Ant√≥n Bridge, in the city's coat of arms. The estuary of Bilbao flows next to it. Introduction The Gothic style is an artistic style of the 15th and 16th centuries. The great majority of those centuries' buildings have deteriorated with the passing of time and have been reconstructed. Consequently, they do not support the same Gothic essence anymore. Nevertheless, in buildings such as Saint Anthony's church, even though it has been reconstructed, it is possible to observe some Gothic features as the rib vaults and the pointed arches. History The church was built at the end of the 15th century on a plot where there had been a years a warehouse for three hundred years. It is considered an asset of cultural interest since 17 July 1984, in the category \\"National Historic-Artistic Monument\\". Church of San Anton by painters Jenaro P√©rez Villaamil and Bichebois in 1850, published in the work Espa√±a art√≠stica y monumental. In 1300 Diego L√≥pez de Haro gave the municipal charter. The river and the plot were incorporated to the new village called Bilbao. Some claim that in 1334 Alfonso XI of Castile ordered to build a fortress and wall that were used like a dike against the flood. A wall was discovered in 2002 by an archaeological excavation but the claim is still inconclusive. Some time later this two buildings were replaced by one church dedicated to Saint Anton Abbot. This church was consecrated in 1433. In that moment the church only has one nave with a rectangular floor and a vaulted roof. Nowadays we can see the old foundations of that church near the old wall of Bilbao. Vaults of Church of San Anton In 1478 they start a new project to increase the church, because it was very small and the congregation of faithful people was increasing. This enlargement, in Gothic style, was finished in the first part of the 16th century. Throughout history this church has suffered a lot of damages and was closed two times. The main source of damage was the Nervi√≥n river because the church is very close to it. A lot of flooding happened during the history and a part of the furniture inside was affected by it. The last flood was in 1983 and it affected the church; it destroyed furniture, drag doors and railings. During the war the bombing and fire the church suffer a lot of damages. Especially during the Carlist war. Caused by this war the church had to close because it was used like warehouse of management. The second time when Saint Anton had to close was in 1881. This was caused by the tumbledown state of the church. This restoration done by Sabino Goikoetxea was very polemic because he change a lot of original things. Gothic art in Biscay Gothic art was created in France in the 13th century, but it is not until the 14th century when it was introduced in Biscay, due to the poverty. In the 14th century the population and the economy grew, carrying the Gothic into Biscay. Windows of San Anton The ogival art or Gothic art was born in France, and it was extended to the rest of Europe. In Spain the ogival architecture is used a half century later than in France. As the French influence entered by Navarre, it avoided the Basque Country, so it was even later when it came to Biscay. Most of the buildings are not really big, even if we can find Santiago's cathedral in Bilbao or Andra Mari of Lekeitio. The Gothic architecture, with its ogival arches (that is why it is also called ogival architecture), was what they needed in Biscay. This arches needed an exterior backing, which began in the wall. The concentric arches became peaked and ogival, instead of the half- pointed arches. They were adorned with vegetal, zoomorphic or human representations. The vaults began being as simple-ribbed but finally they were used terceletes. Most of the buildings were begun in the 14th century, but only Santiago's cathedral was ended then. The rest were consecrated between the 15th and 16th centuries. The Biscay Gothic lost the spirit of the International Gothic: they were not monumental buildings with windows which played with the light creating a mystical aura inside, but small buildings, becoming that a characteristic of the local Gothic. Andra Mari of Guernica, Getxo, Ordu√±a, Gue√±es, Erandio, Galdakao, Portugalete and Lekeitio, Santa Eufemia of Bermeo, Santiago's Cathedral, Basilica of Bego√±a, San Vicente and San Anton of Bilbao and San Severino of Balmaseda have to be named as important buildings of the Gothic of Biscay. Chapels of San Ant√≥n The Church of San Ant√≥n contains three chapels: =Chapel of Provost= It is the first and widest chapels that the Church of San Ant√≥n possesses. Built in 1530 this chapel is an example of the late Gothic style which can be seen in other nearby construction like Bego√±a, La encarnaci√≥n, San Vicente of Abando and San Pedro of Deusto. There is a big ogival arch at the entrance of the chapel. This arch is closed by a grille that was forged in Bilbao. At the top of the entrance it is located this chapels founder's coat of arms: the Lezama- Leguizam√≥n family's coat of arms. In the past there was a passageway that linked this chapel and Lezama-Leguizam√≥n family's tower house. There is a stained glass window located in the front wall. Chapel of the church of San Ant√≥n, Bilbao. The chapel held two altarpieces. One of the altarpieces is dedicated to Santa Ana and the other is dedicated to Virgen de la Consolaci√≥n. At present the chapel contains an altar that contains a wood carved sculpture of Inmaculada and some paintings. There is also a silver lamp with the following inscription carved on it: \\"Esta l√°mpara dieron a su capilla de Santa Ana, Do√±a Mar√≠a de Leguizam√≥n y Don Domingo de Isasi-Leguizam√≥n. 1621\\" Arch that unites two chapels of San Ant√≥n's church, Bilbao. =Chapel of Piety= The Chapel of Piety is smaller than the Chapel of Provost but bigger than the Chapel of San Roque. It possesses similar attributes of those present in the Chapel of Provost. It has a Gothic structure in the entrance arch, rib vault on the ceilings and stained glass windows. The grille closing this chapel is older than the grille closing the Chapel of Provost. The top part of this grille includes the coat of arms of the Recalde family along with details of The Passion. The intermediate frieze contains the following inscription written in Latin: \\"O Mater Dei, memento mei Iesu\\". It could be translated as \\"Oh mother of god, remember us before Jesus\\". In 1919 the Chapel of Provost and the Chapel of Piety were united with a Gothic arch to enlarge the communion rail. =Chapel of San Roque= It's the smallest chapel out of the three that the church of San Anton possess. This chapel is composed by a rib vault and a small blinded Gothic window in the right wall. It was the first entrance of the church. When the new main front was built the Ibiceta family which had their family sepulchre in the chapel decided to transform it to an artistic mausoleum with prayerful sculptures and diverse decorative elements. The chapel contains a round-headed arch sustained by Corinthians columns. At present days there are present in this chapel the sculpture of San Roque above the sepulture and the sculptures of Santa Lucia and San Sebastian flanking it. Fa√ßade of Renaissance Fa√ßade of Renaissance in San Anton of Bilbao. The Saint Anthon church, in Bilbao, contains a typical front, not of the own and general style of the church, which is the Gothic, but of the Renaissance style born in the 16th century. This owes to the repeated reforms to which the church has been submitted, and every reform has contributed something new and characteristic of that epoch. To begin with, it is necessary to emphasize that there exist features that belong neither to the Renaissance nor to the Gothic. Example of it we have the arches of the entry. These arches are called round arches and are typical of the Romanesque style; and at the door there is another type of arch that was used at the end of the 15th century. A really Gothic and visible element from any point of view, are the rib vaults, that are in the whole church, so much in as externally, though in this paragraph we indicate only the ones outside. In the front we find the front of the church, a front that goes from the sides of the door up to being over it. The mentioned front was built in the year 1548, a generous front in proportions and rich in all the decorative resources of the Renaissance. Around the arch we notice small sculptures of low relief, with the form of heads, symbol of the anthropocentrism that dominated the Renaissance epoch. The great majority of the heads contain wings of angels behind them; and just in the middle of all, in the central keystone, we notice a slightly bigger sculpture than the others, with the form of a shield, and with the year 1548 recorded in it, as a signature of the builder. In every side of the door we can see another typical example of the Renaissance, which was the use of Corinthian columns. Those which appear in this church are of small size in comparison with other buildings, but they support all their essence: a Corinthian capital with its rectangular annulet and abacus and its acanthus' leaves, some coiled forming \\"caul√≠culos\\". The shaft we find it in grooved style and the end of the shaft and the foot we can see it with sculptural drawings of plants (basically leaves) and human representations. And to finish with the front, as we can observe in this image, we find two niches, one to each side of the door, which until 1892 were empty, and that from that year's reform, the sculptures of Saint Pedro and Saint Paul went to occupy them. The niches contain scallops, which are the space of the niche itself, with representations that venerate what is inside the niche. In this case we also find in the scallop two little angels holding a medallion with the head of another human being. All these elements (niches, angels, scallops, medallions, Corinthian columns) are representative elements of the Renaissance style of the 15th and 16th centuries; all of them have as canon to represent the beauty and the naturalism, and all of them shape the great front of the Saint Anthon church of Bilbao. Belfry Tower Belfry Tower In 1774 the construction of the Belfry Tower began by Gabriel de Capelastegui. This one had to substitute the former one. The tower has a quadrangular body that raises near the central roof. Above it we can find the belfry crowned by a dome and a lantern, and with aunctions in the weathercock. It has a shining Baroque dieciochesco style, being one of the best examples of the whole Basque Country. The weathercock dates back of in 1775, concretely it was made on 7 December that year. We get to the belfry going up the 106 limestone stairs and its banister, which has a surprising geometric precision. From the base to the lantern there are 32 wooden steps, that need to be repaired. Even if from the four eyes of the tower you can have wonderful panoramics, it is true that from the lantern they enlarge. That is why, doting it of a better and more secure access would be convenient, to allow more people to see what probably is the best view of the city. The outside watch was ubicated in this lantern, with bronze sphere and golden numbers, it was situated between the two coats of arms made of bronze in the consulate balcony, in front of the Mercado de la Ribera. The bell, substituted the one before, The Circumcision of the Lord, which fell on 29 June 1779. The actual one has the following inscription: \\"IHS. San Antonio Abad. Ora pro nobis, Antonio de la Hoza me Hizo. 1829.\\" The last contributions date from 1902: the new portico in front of the Ronda street, the new sacristy and the large parroquial dependences. The construction of the portico and the frontages which run until the bridge are a good decision of its architect, Enrique Epalza, for making them in Isabelline Gothic, avoiding like this to oppose to the temples style.

The military-digital complex (MDC) is the militarization of Cyber Operations by governments and corporations, often through monetary relationships between computer programmers in private companies and the military to combat the threat of cyber terrorism and warfare. Cyber operations since 2000 have increased dramatically, with the recent branch of the US Strategic Command the United States Cyber Command. Cyber operations has been defined by the Washington Post as, :\\"Offensive and defensive cyber (or digital) warfare, including the fields of computer network attack, computer network exploitation and computer network defense; as well as traditional electronic warfare (e.g. jamming) intended to deny an adversary use of their electronically dependent equipment through \\"non-kinetic\\" means -- that is, by fighting with electrons rather than explosives.\\" As cyber attacks become an increasingly common threat to the security of civilians and highly classified governmental information, a need to combat the threat by means of Computer network operations and Computer Network Defense have arisen. It is important to note however that protection is only one component of the Military-digital complex and that the use of Information Warfare within the complex can be used to achieve military operations and an upper-hand in economic exploits. The Military-digital complex contains many components which align it succinctly to its industrial counterpart, for example the use of defense contractors. Although hired Contractors may not be explicitly named as such they still expose the complex to complications such as the principal agent problem and consequently moral hazard. The MDC is seen as a progression as nations move globally towards cyberwarfare, indeed the cyber war is increasingly being acknowledged as the \\"fifth domain of warfare\\". The MDC is a necessity for governmental bodies in order to maintain high standards within their cyber army, for example the USA boasts over \\"143 private companies involved in top secret cyber operations programs\\", however James Gosler a government specialist in cyber security indicates that the USA have a severe shortage of government cybersecurity specialists.  History  President Dwight D. Eisenhower famously coined the precursor phrase Military-industrial complex when describing the twinning of the arms industry to the military under the government; this paved the way for the emergence of the military- digital complex. Technology has been a part of war since the dawn of warfare. Neolithic tools such as daggers were used as weaponry and clan rivalry long before recorded history. The Bronze Age and Iron Age saw technological improvements namely in the advancements of weaponry and subsequently the arrival of complex industries. It was not until the late 19th and early 20th Century that weaponry advanced in leaps and bounds to the armaments mankind witnesses today, however even then industry was relatively independent of the government and military. World War I and World War II were two important factors that led to the consequent military-industrial complex. Eric Hobsbawm in his book Age of Extremes outlines how categorically countries like Japan, USA and Russia had to develop their own military industry to support their militaristic efforts, creating a complex whereby the economies then straddled on this arms industry. Consequently, the procurement of missiles, ballistics, nuclear weapons, destroyers and submarines shows a marked difference between the ancient acquisitions of countries. At the dawn on the 21st Century, the world has seen an emergence of digital equipment in the use of warfare, spanning from satellite surveillance systems all the way to dedicated agencies such as United States Cyber Command fully equipped with thousands of professionals manning computers on a 24/365 basis in order to prevent a cyber attack. The use of computers has long been an essential tool in warfare, however as warfare moves from the traditional frontiers of land, sea, air and space to \\"cyber space\\" the use of computers is becoming not only essential but vital. Gregory Rattray, author of Strategic Warfare in Cyberspace, explains how the history of warfare in the information age is far reaching and is well beyond military operation including financial crime and economic espionage. The history of this cyber warfare shows that it crosses global boundaries and encompasses political agendas, attacks on the USA such as Titan Rain show an attack from networks and computers situated in China for example. As the age of digital warfare progressed it has become evident that human reliance on technological equipment to monitor essential utilities such as our electricity grids has proven cataclysmic. As the threat became increasingly relevant, the emergence of big corporate players on the MDC scene including names such as Symantec, McAfee and traditional defense contractors such as Northrop Grumman and Lockheed Martin, as the cyber threat grows so does mankind's reliance on corporate players such as the aforementioned, creating an iron triangle among government, military and these global security corporations.

The book focuses on the history of liberalism and libertarianism in general, and contains a sample of liberal thinkers from John Locke to Amartya Sen. It was published by Universitetsforlaget with financial support from Civita and Fritt Ord. The book received mixed reviews by critics. Background Svendsen was 39 years old at the time of publication, teaching philosophy at the University of Bergen. In the Spring of 2007, Civita hosted a debate on the content in the word \\"Liberalism\\". It took place at a public breakfast meeting at a caf√© in Oslo. The anthology was published two years later, in May 2009, also at a breakfast meeting. Norwegian politicians and writers were invited to the debate, among them Cathrine Holst, Henrik Syse and Ove Vanebo. In a 2009 interview with the Norwegian newspaper Klassekampen, Svendsen stated that he hoped the book would become \\"Civita's Red Book\\". Content The anthology contains entries for various liberal thinkers, among them John Locke, Voltaire, Immanuel Kant, Wilhelm von Humboldt, Mary Wollstonecraft, Alexis de Tocqueville, John Stuart Mill, Ludwig von Mises, Friedrich Hayek, Karl Popper, Isaiah Berlin, John Rawls, Robert Nozick and Amartya Sen. Each entry consists of a short biography of the thinker, as well as a translated work. Svendsen states in the foreword of the book that he tried to select works that had not been translated to Norwegian before. Reception The book received much lukewarm criticism from reviewers, many of whom were arguing that the selected persons in the anthology did not fit together. Eirik H√∏yer Leivestad, reviewing for Bergens Tidende, supported this view, and stated that \\"crazy\\" minarchist libertarians like Ludwig von Mises, Robert Nozick and Friedrich Hayek did not belong in a book with \\"tempered\\" liberal thinkers like John Locke, Immanuel Kant and John Stuart Mill. Professor at the University of Oslo, Trond Berg Eriksen, also criticised the anthology for being contradictory, and labelled it \\"not a peaceful cemetery\\" in his review in Morgenbladet. He also criticised Svendsen for leaving out prolific liberal thinkers such as Adam Smith, Thomas Jefferson, Raymond Aron, Milton Friedman and Quentin Skinner.

There, since there was a later ruler of the same name in Mecklenburg, Frederick Wiliam II, and this dynasty numbered its members without regard to earlier division of its territory or the higher rank obtained in 1815. Wikipedia tries to correct this common mistake. (28 March 1675 - 31 July 1713) was the reigning Duke of Mecklenburg in the Mecklenburg-Schwerin portion of the duchy of Mecklenburg from 1692 until 1713. Frederick William was the eldest son of Prince Frederick, Duke of Mecklenburg-Grabow, and Christine Wilhelmine of Hesse-Homburg (1653‚Äì1722). He was a nephew of the childless Duke Christian Ludwig I of Mecklenburg. Frederick Wiliam succeeded his uncle on 21 June 1692 as regent of the Schwerin portion of the duchy of Mecklenburg. After the extinction of the Mecklenburg-G√ºstrow line of the dynasty with the death of Duke Gustav Adolph in 1695, Frederick William became embroiled in a violent succession dispute with his uncle Adolf Frederick II that escalated quickly. It brought the country to the brink of civil war and was settled only through the intervention of foreign powers. The king of Denmark and Norway, Frederick IV, gave up the inheritance request for the Mecklenburg-G√ºstrow principality in exchange for the Duke's support for Denmark-Norway in the Great Northern War. The dispute was ended in 1701 by the Hamburg Compromise. Mecklenburg was again split into two parts with limited autonomy. The two sub-principalities, Mecklenburg-Strelitz and Mecklenburg-Schwerin, existed until 1918. The Compromise also introduced the right of succession of the first-born to the dynasty. In 1708, Frederick William introduced the \\"Consumption and Tax Statute\\" to overcome the fiscal consequences of the Thirty Years' War and the Great Northern War. In addition to the taxation of knights and the clergy, this law included the abolition of serfdom, freeing farmers from dependence on their landlords. The former peasants could lease their land and forced labor was to be replaced by work for a salary. This created a sharp conflict between the duke and the landed estates. Frederick William married Sophie Charlotte of Hesse-Kassel on 2 January 1704 in Kassel. She was a daughter of Count Charles I of Hesse-Kassel. The couple had no children. Frederick William had numerous mistresses, with whom he had at least nine children, including: * Charles Louis von Mecklenburg auf Zib√ºhl, L√ºbzin and Karcheez (a son with Sophie Magdalene of Pl√ºskow, died 1703) Included in the Mecklenburg nobility as \\"v.

In 1719, she married Hermann Christian von Wolffradt (died in 1723 in D√∂mitz). She was a mistress of Duke Karl Leopold of Mecklenburg. Whether she was an illegitimate daughter of Frederick William is a point of controversy in the historical literature.Her ancestry is highly controversial in the literature; next to the Duke of Mecklenburg, authors also mention Frederick William I, the Prussian \\"Soldier King\\", as her father. It is considered implausible and improbable that she actually used the noble family name of Mecklenburg. Nothing is (yet) known about her recognition or ennoblement Frederick William died in Mainz on 31 July 1713 on his return from Schlangenbad.

He was also the father of the samurai named Miyamoto Musashi. He was the son of Miyamoto Musashi no kami Yoshimoto, a vassal of Shinmen Iga no Kami, the lord of Takayama Castle in the Yoshino district of Mimasaka Province. Munisai was relied upon by Lord Shinmen Sokan, the head of the Shinmen clan and so was allowed to use the Shinmen name. He was one of the few to have obtained the title of \\"Unrivaled Under The Sun\\", title offered to him by the Sh≈çgun Ashikaga. Munisai founded his own ry≈´ha: the T≈çri Jitte Ry≈´, which was one of the schools taught to his son Miyamoto Musashi, who conceived the Hy≈çh≈ç Niten Ichi-ry≈´. Biography =Munisai's death date= Because of the uncertainty centering on Munisai (when he died, whether he was truly Musashi's father, etc.), Musashi's mother is known with even less confidence. Here are a few possibilities: # Munisai's tomb was correct. He died in 1580, leaving two daughters; his wife adopted a recently born child, from the Akamatsu clan, intended to succeed Munisai at his jitte school. Omasa, Munisai's widow, was not truly Musashi's mother. # The tomb was wrong. Munisai lived a good deal longer, later than 1590 possibly. Musashi, then, was born to Munisai's first wife, Yoshiko (daughter to Bessho Shigeharu, who formerly controlled Hirafuku village until he lost a battle in 1578 to Yamanaka Shikanosuke). Munisai divorced her after Musashi's birth, whereupon she decamped for her father's house, leaving Musashi with Munisai. Musashi grew up treating Munisai's second wife, Omasa (daughter to Lord Shinmen) as his mother. This second scenario is laid out in an entry to the Tasumi family's genealogy. The daughter of Bessho Shigeharu first married Hirata Munisai and was divorced from him a few years later. After that she married Tasumi Masahisa. The second wife of Tasumi Masahisa was the mother of Miyamoto Musashi. Musashi's childhood name was Hirata Den. He later became famous on account of his swordsmanship. During his childhood, he went to Hirafuku to find his real mother. He moved in with the Tasumi family. # A variant of this second theory is based on the fact that the tombstone states that Omasa gave birth to Musashi on 4 March 1584, and died of it. Munisai then remarried to Yoshiko. They divorced, as in the second theory, but Yoshiko took Musashi, who was 7 at the time, with her, and married Tasumi Masahisa. # Kenji Tokitsu prefers to assume a birth date of 1581, which avoids the necessity of assuming the tombstone to be erroneous (although this poses the problem of from whom then Musashi received the transmission of the family martial art). =Duel against the Yoshioka= Sometime after Ashikaga Yoshiteru became the Sh≈çgun, he started in Kyoto a comparison duel between Munisai, who was still called Hirata at the time, and the founder of the Yoshioka-ry≈´ school of sword- fighting: Yoshioka Kenpo (who was also the sword instructor of the Ashikaga). Kenpo won the first match, while Munisai won the other two. This event later started a feud between Munisai's son Miyamoto Musashi and the following generation of the Yoshioka family. Munisai having won the match, the sh≈çgun gave him the title of \\"Unrivaled Under The Sun\\".Miyamoto Musashi and in Yoshioka-ry≈´ =Recruited by the Shinmen clan= Having heard about Munisai, the head of the Shinmen clan, Shinmen Sokan, recruited Munisai as instructor of his troops. In 1589, for unknown reasons, Sokan ordered Munisai to kill his student Honiden Gekinosuke.Tokitsu, p. 14 After this event, he started training his son Musashi in the ways of the sword and of the jutte, but it didn't last long since the inhabitants of Miyamoto village, displeased with Gekinosuke's death, forced him to move away in the village of Kawakami. He died in 1592, surely due to the amount of stress caused by the fact that many swordsmen wanted to claim his title afterwards.

History  In 2003 Graham Waterhouse composed the Bassoon Quintet, to be premiered as part of a composer's portrait concert at the Gasteig. On 5 October 2003 music for one to ten players, conducted by Yaron Traub, was performed in the Kleiner Konzertsaal, including the Piccolo Quintet. The bassoon part was first played by Lyndon Watts, the principal bassoonist of the M√ºnchner Philharmoniker, in the presence of bassoonist William Waterhouse, the composer's father. The string quartet was formed by Odette Couch, Kirsty Hilton, Isabel Charisius and the composer. A revised version was performed in Munich on 14 March 2011 in a chamber concert of the Bavarian Tonk√ºnstlerverband (Musical Artists' Association). The soloist was again Watts, who also premiered Bernd Redmann's Migrant for bassoon and string quartet, and played the first of four quartets for a woodwind instrument and string trio, called \\"Finnische Quartette\\", by J√∂rg Duda. The string players, besides the composer, were members of the M√ºnchner Philharmoniker, Cl√©ment Courtin, Namiko Fuse and Konstantin Sellheim. The quintet is in preparation to be published by Zimmermann. It was played in concerts to celebrate the composer's 50th birthday in Munich and Frankfurt.  Music  As in the composer's Cello Concerto of 1995, the movements of the quintet are in the sequence \\"slow introduction ‚Äì fast ‚Äì slow ‚Äì fast\\". The introduction presents characteristic intervals and the wide tessitura of the bassoon, a range of three and a half octaves. The predominantly \\"lyrical mood\\" of the work is also established. \\"Restless energy\\" defines the Allegro movement, a four note motif is passed between cello and bassoon, later dominating figuration in the bassoon part. The slow movement is reminiscent of the composer‚Äôs memories of liturgical Armenian chant, which he experienced in 1996 in the Armenian district of Jerusalem around Easter. He describes: \\"The meandering line, continually curling back on itself and the resonance of the massive, ancient stone walls are mirrored in the writing, as continually shifting, changing fragments of the \\"chant\\" are passed between the instruments\\". The last movement has a more symphonic aspect. The strings and the bassoon play arpeggio motifs in open intervals such as fifths and major sixths. The intervals of the introduction reappear on high harmonics in the strings. A virtuoso coda concludes the work.

It is about Saint John of the Cross, a Catholic priest important to the Counter- Reformation, in solitary confinement in the Carmelite monastery in Toledo, Spain. Saint John of the Cross was a member of the Carmelite order and a follower of Saint Teresa of Jesus‚Äô teachings. Teresa of Jesus wanted to reform the Order to emphasize poverty, austerity, and seclusion. Additionally, Teresa wanted to reimplement observation of the Primitive Rule that Pope Eugene IV relaxed in 1432 within the Carmelites. The Primitive Rule calls for more time for recitation, devotional studies and readings and puts more emphasis on evangelizing the population. Observers were not allowed to eat meat and had to fast periodically between the Feast of the Cross in September and Easter. Together with Saint John of the Cross, Saint Teresa founded the Order of the Discalced Carmelites. ‚ÄúDiscalced‚Äù is a Latin word that means ‚Äúwithout shoes‚Äù and comes from the Discalced Carmelites‚Äô tradition of dressing simply and without shoes. The reforms were very controversial among the Carmelites in the 1570s. A group of Carmelites captured John on 2 December 1576 in his dwelling in √Åvila and brought him to the monastery in Toledo. There, the priests jailed John. He spent 9 months in a small room in horrible conditions with limited light, food, and contact with the outside world. During his time in the monastery, he suffered greatly. The movie tells the story of the nine months that he spent in solitary confinement in the monastery between December 1576 and July 1577. John of the Cross was a famous Spanish poet celebrated for his works that include ‚ÄúSpiritual Canticles‚Äù and ‚ÄúDark Night of the Soul.‚Äù The title of the movie comes from his poem. His mystical works are about the development of the soul and of the relationship between the soul and God. During his time in the monastery, he memorized 31 verses of his work ‚ÄúSpiritual Canticles.‚Äù Many years later, he finished his piece. He wrote all of his works between 1577 and his death in 1591; therefore, his time in the monastery influenced all of his works. In 1726, Pope Benedict XIII named John as a saint. Saint John of the Cross is one of the 36 doctors of the Church. Saura both wrote the screenplay and directed the film. Andr√©s Vicente G√≥mez is the producer. Juan Diego plays the role of Saint John of the Cross. The film was entered in the 39th Berlin International Film Festival.  Plot  The only time that we see images of the city of Toledo is at the beginning of the film. The first scene of the movie depicts John's journey as a prisoner to the monastery in Toledo. We see a view of the city of Toledo in the early hours of the morning from the mountains. John wears a blindfold so he can‚Äôt see where he is going. John enters the monastery and a priest removes his blindfold in front of all of the priests in the hall. They force him to stand trial in front of the friars in the hall of the monastery, but he refuses to obey the friars because he will not ask for forgiveness for his Reformist beliefs. The friars obligate John to take off his clothes in front of them and put on their robes, but Juan refuses to do so. Therefore, they put him in solitary confinement. Later, they take him out of his room so that they can whip him while they sing religious hymns. After his first whipping, he begins to create his religious poems. He recites his verses while he prays to God for the strength to survive. He has flashbacks to a scene when the Mother of a convent introduces him to the nuns who live there. One of the nuns stares at him, behavior that surprises John. In the following scene, John is praying to God in his room when the same nun appears. She wears a white dress and is illuminated by the light from the small window. She begins to take off her clothes in front of John. John approaches her and touches her as he circles her. But, after a moment, he appears very uncomfortable and he walks away from her. When he turns around, she had disappeared. The only thing that remains is the white dress on the floor. One of the friars of the monastery reads the history of the nun, Justina, in front of all of the friars in monastery while they eat. She was tormented by the Devil and almost renounced the church. In the same scene, the priests explain to John that the Pope wants to end the Discalced Carmelites, but still, John will not renounce his beliefs. John is sleeping in his bed when a hand appears next to his head. More hands appear from all sides of the bed. The hands rip his clothes apart and scratch his body while he screams. The image of Justina, the nun, appears but this time, she wears a dark blue dress. The hands disappear when the friar who takes care of John enters the room. John says to him that there are demons who want to take over his body to tempt him. He claims that he had fought against the devil before and offers to tell the warden about the first time that the demon tried to occupy him. John tells him the story of a women in the convent who people came to listen to because the seemed dictated by the Devil. The scene changes to John's memories of the same woman, Justina. She writhes on the mud floor in the room and says that the demon possesses her. She throws a cross against the wall. The scene changes again to another one of John's memories when he enters Justine's room and sees someone in Justine's bed engaged in sexual activities with her. John himself appears from the sheets. Close to the end of the movie, John interrupts the dinner and the head priest's Bible reading, saying that he is too proud (referring to himself). But, when the priest asks him to repeat what he had just said, John asks for forgiveness and says that his outburst was a moment of weakness. He reaffirms his reformist beliefs and says that they (the friars in the monastery) are mistaken about their traditional beliefs. In June, John hears Justine's voice and it says that he needs to leave the monetary because he has other, more important work to do in the outside world. Therefore, John uses his scissors and a ball of yarn to measure the distance from the window in his room to the ground. He rips the fabric of his robe to make a rope. When the warden gives him privacy to use the facilities, John breaks the lock on his door. In the night, he escapes from the monastery from the window with his cord; the film ends here.

From the beginning, the Carmelite priests treat St. John in a cruel manner, despite the fact that he is also a Carmelite. The friars in the monastery abuse John; we see both the physical and mental manners in which they cause serious harm to Juan. In the first scene in the monastery, the friars yell at him and tell him that he has to obey them and renounce his beliefs. The friars neither listen to Juan nor think about his propositions. It's obvious that they are not tolerant to other religious ideas; they do not like threats to their religious practices. Saura creates a mechanical image of the priests in the scene when they are whipping John in a line singing religious hymns. One of the friars apologizes to John and refers to him as ‚Äúbrother.‚Äù Here, Saura presents the paradox of the conflict that the movie displays: the tensions are between different groups of the same Catholic orden. Saura relates the fight between the Carmelite groups to the Biblical fight between Cain and Abel in Genesis. The fight between these Biblical brothers is very important to the Christians because it denounces familial divisions and lack of love between family members. The act of relating the two fights is an act that perhaps Saura does to denounce this time period in Catholic history. In addition to whipping John and locking him in a small room, the Carmelites also do not given him enough food. He only gets bread, water, and a bit of fish. They treat him like an animal. When he eats, it appears as if he has never before eaten in his life. The fact that John eats fish is very important; fish is a symbolic food in the Christian community. Fish signifies salvation because fish live in the water and the act of baptism (a sacred act that represents the salvation of the soul from one's sins) also occurs in water.McNabb, Allan. \\"What does the fish symbol mean in religion?Bible study on the ichthys (fish symbol).\\" What does the fish symbol mean in religion? Bible study on the ichthys (fish symbol). What does the Christian fish symbol mean? Accessed 2 July 2017. http://www.biblestudyguide.org/articles/fish-symbol/fish-symbol.htm. Therefore, the fish in the film represents the presence of Christ and that John's sins are pardoned. John looks very sick and sad; his health deteriorates throughout the movie. During the movie it is obvious that John's mental health gets worse while he is in solitary confinement as well. We can see in his face and in his body the physical effects of the abuse that he suffers. In the way that he talks to God and that he looks at other people with deep sadness and pain, we know that he suffers greatly. Despite the fact that John lives in these terrible conditions, he loses neither his hope nor his faith. But, Saura does not portray all of characters in the convent as brutal and dogmatic. The interactions between John and the friar who takes care of him change significantly during the movie. At the beginning of the film, the warden refuses to talk to John. The lack of human contact and sympathy is very sad. John is separate from the world not only because he lives in isolation but also because he has no connection with another person. However, this situation changes when the warden listens to John's story about Justina. He is interested in John's interactions with her and with the Devil because he can see John's suffering and interior struggles. He decides to help John. Saura represents a truth about humanity: the connections between human beings are based on shared experiences and vulnerability. After this interaction, the warden has a strong interest in John's verses and asks him about them. = Analysis of the filming techniques = There are some moments when John breaks the fourth wall with the audience. The first time, he is talking to God, but his eyes are focused on the camera. This is a moment when the audience is ‚Äúconfused‚Äù with God. Saura demonstrates the power of the religious lectures and beliefs that John holds by directly incorporating the audience in this moment. John always continues to talk to God. He begins to create and recite his poems while looking at the camera as well. The effect of these moments is that the audience experiences his pain. The contact between John and the audience's eyes creates a deep human connection - exactly what John lacks in his time during the monetary in Toledo. The music demonstrates the emotional suffering that John feels and highlights important contrasts in the film. In the first scene, the director uses ominous music when John is traveling as a prisoner to the monastery to foreshadow the suffering that is about to happen. The music changes in the scene when the nun appears in John's room. A women's voice sings opera music. It emphasizes the contrast between passionate and sexual femininity and the nuns‚Äô strict and pious life in the church. The music in the scene when the hands attack John in his bed serve to add to the suspense and emphasizes the trauma and suffering that he experiences. The majority of the film is very dark because it represents John's experience in his solitary room without light. He only has a small window and very little contact with the sun when he walks to the dining room. The first time that he enters the solitary room, the light illuminates only his head. The rest of his body and the room itself are dark. A small amount of light shines on the bed. We hear the strong wind outside of his room. It appears to be a hostile and harsh place. The walls of the room, the blanket, and the pillow are dirty and shabby. For John, the darkness represents the Devil and the light represents God. He describes the light as something very beautiful. His time in the room represents the fight against the Devil to find a better way to follow God. John and the warden visit an old priest on his deathbed. In this scene, John relates the light with the lover (how he refers to God) and therefore affirms the light's symbolism. John says that because the old priest is close to death, he is beginning his journey toward the light. It appears that the old priest can see this light at the beginning of his conversation with John, but right before his death, the priest says that he cannot see anything. This scene is a concrete example of the fight between the conflicting ideas of the two Carmelite groups. = Representation of St. John‚Äôs Works = There is a scene when John touches himself while the light from the window shines on his body, moving up from his feet to his head. Perhaps this represents the almost sexual relationship that John writes about in his works about the intimate relationship between God and the soul. He hears own voice reciting one of his works. The light is even brighter in this moment and lights up his face; it is a powerful display of John's love and faith in God. He sees something that he describes as beautiful in the light. The warden watches him through the peephole with an expression of wonder. John's ability to survive and maintain his strong will demonstrates his individual power and the power of his beliefs. John recites verses of his works in his room constantly. He changes different words and phrases as part of his creative process, but he always speaks with the same serious and emotional tone. John says that his songs are about the relationship between the soul and the spouse, God. In one scene, he recites a verse from his famous work ‚ÄúThe Spiritual CanticleCruz, San Juan De la. \\"C√°ntico Espiritual.\\" San Juan de la Cruz. 2017. Accessed July 02, 2017. http://www.sanjuandelacruz.com/obras-san-juan-de-la-cruz/cantico-espiritual/.‚Äù about a dove to the warden. The warden recognizes the beauty of the words, but he doesn‚Äôt try to understand the verse, perhaps because he is fearful of thinking about John and the Discalced Carmelites‚Äô radical ideas. John describes the inspiration for his works as a ‚Äúmystical intelligence‚Äù about the love between the soul and God. He says that it is impossible to describe with words what he doesn't know how to feel. The warden brings John paper so that he can write his poems. This simple act shows his respect for John's ideas, despite the fact that he does not necessarily share them. When John has the paper and begins to write ‚ÄúThe Dark Night of the Soul,‚Äù the light appears more strongly than in the previous scenes. John looks much happier but still, he is very sick and his health is poor. Here, Saura reveals a bit about John's creative process. He receives his inspiration from the light and his time in the jail. He suggests that the proximity to death that John experiences is a reason that he has such a strong connection to his own religious beliefs.  Historical Accuracy  The film presents true events in John's life to give context. At the beginning of the film, a priest in the monastery reads historical facts about John's life when he enters the hall for the first time for his trial. He also introduces the connection between John and Teresa of Jesus in this moment. Teresa is represented in a negative manner because the priest says that she has created a conspiracy, therefore presenting the tensions between the different Carmelite groups from the beginning. The priest describes the differences between his group and the Discalced Carmelites accurately as well. John's escape from the window using the rope made of his robe is also in line with the historical facts that we have. But the film is not supposed to be a narrative; rather, it is an investigation. According to El Pa√≠s, the film explores the central question surrounding John's famous life: ‚Äú¬øC√≥mo, en efecto, en tan atroz adversidad se las arregl√≥ Juan de la Cruz para componer tal exquisitez, una tan delicada m√∫sica de la palabra?Fern√°ndez-Santos, √Ångel. \\"Excelente acogida a 'La noche oscura', de Saura.\\" EL PA√çS.

The manner in which the filming techniques present Juan Diego in such intense moments helps us to understand how the poet was able to write something so important to Spanish literature in such terrible conditions. In the interview, Saura says that the film is not about religion; rather, the film focuses specially on John's interior processes and secular mysticism. Therefore, the film is about the skills of this important lyrical poet in Spanish literature.

The principles defy the laws of physics, but that doesn't stop people from periodically claiming to have invented or discovered one.\\" According to Phys.org (11 August 2011), the demonstrations held from January to April 2011 had several flaws that compromised their credibility and Rossi had refused to perform tests that could verify his claims. University of Bologna researchers have attended some E-Cat demonstrations, but only as observers. On 5 November 2011, the University of Bologna clarified that its researchers had not been involved in the demonstrations and that none of those took place at the university. Rossi had signed a contract with the university, but the contract was terminated and no research was done because Rossi did not make the first payment.. Retrieved on 10 November 2011.E-cat: dichiarazione del Dipartimento di Fisica, 26 January 2012, University of Bologna. Skeptic Ian Bryce speculated that the E-Cat was misconnected during demonstrations, and that the power attributed to fusion is supplied to the device through the earth wire. Dick Smith offered Rossi one million dollars to demonstrate that the E-Cat system worked as claimed, while the power through the earth wire was also being measured, which Rossi refused. The \\"checking the wires\\" detail is in Peter Thieberger, a senior physicist at Brookhaven National Laboratory, said it would be very difficult for this misconnection to happen by accident and that the issue could only be cleared with a fully independent test. On 28 October 2011 the unit was \\"customer tested\\" and was said to release 2,635 kWh during five and a half hours of self-sustained mode, an average power of 479 kilowatts ‚Äì just under half the promised power of one megawatt. Independent observers were not allowed to watch the measurements or make their own, and the plant remained connected to a power supply during the test allegedly to supply power to the fans and the water pumps.

Focardi states that the nuclear process is facilitated by a secret additive, known only by Rossi and not by him. According to Focardi, the process would be much less intense without this additive.. Retrieved on 10 July 2011.) Rossi and Focardi are then reported to have been unable to find a peer-reviewed scientific journal that would publish their paper describing how they claim the Energy Catalyzer operates.

In May 2013 a non-peer-reviewed paper describing \\"results obtained from evaluations of the operation of the E-Cat HT in two test runs\\" was submitted to the arXiv digital archive. Although the authors of the paper wrote that they were not in control of all of the aspects of the process, they concluded that, even by the most conservative of measurements, the device produced excess heat with a resulting energy density that was at least one order of magnitude, and possibly several, higher than any other conventional energy source. The test was partly funded by the Swedish energy research consortium, Elforsk. Elforsk stated on their website that the results were very remarkable, but that it was highly questionable to speculate whether nuclear transformation had occurred when no access had been provided to the reactants. In a response to the original manuscript archived on arXiv, commentators criticized the testing as not truly independent, described the report as having \\"characteristics more typically found in pseudo‚Äêscientific texts\\", and stated that \\"The authors seem to jump to conclusions fitting pre‚Äêconceived ideas where alternative explanations are possible.\\"More On Rossi's E-Cat: Ericsson And Pomp Rebut \\"Independent\\" Test, 12 July 2013 Astrophysicist Ethan Siegel commented at ScienceBlogs saying Rossi did not allow the reactants or products to be measured on this occasion. In the previous tests there were not enough and (the only two nickel isotopes which can fuse with hydrogen), at 3.6% and 0.9% respectively, in the reactants to explain the 10% copper output; these isotope levels are typical of natural copper, rather than of fusion by-product. According to Siegel, Rossi also refused to unplug the machine while it was operating despite it being an easy way to surreptitiously power the device. He also added that the supposedly independent testers had to rely on data supplied by Rossi. In October 2014 a non-peer-reviewed paper by the same authors as the May 2013 report describes results from evaluations in March 2014 of an upgraded version of the E-Cat which runs at higher temperatures. Unlike previous demonstrations, the test was carried out with monitoring equipment and in a laboratory not supplied by Rossi, and was run over an extended duration (32 days). However, as with the previous report, the authors were not in full control of the process; Rossi intervened during the insertion of the fuel charge, start up of the reactor, shut down of the reactor, and extraction of the spent fuel. Overall, the total excess heat measured was calculated to be well beyond that possible by any conventional, non-nuclear source. In this report, they present analyses of samples of spent fuel, concluding from the isotopes found that \\"nuclear reactions are therefore indicated to be present in the run process, which however is hard to reconcile with the fact that no radioactivity was detected outside the reactor during the run.\\" Following fuel and ash isotopic analysis, the authors speculate as to isotopes of especially nickel and lithium being part of the reaction, in particular transmutation of and to , and from to through some unknown process. Particle physicist Tommaso Dorigo commented on the 2014 test, called the isotopic measurements \\"startling\\" but he expressed deep concern about Rossi being involved in collecting the spent fuel, that the testers may have \\"overlooked some simple trick\\" and that \\"given the extraordinary nature of the claim‚Ä¶ this constitutes a major flaw, which totally invalidates any conclusions one might otherwise draw.\\" Astrophysicist Ethan Siegel was highly critical of the test, stating that the testers were not independent, that Rossi could have tampered with the fuel samples, that the 'open calorimeter' setup used was inappropriate, and that \\"it‚Äôs relatively easy to fake the amount of energy being drawn through a power cord if there is a hookup to an external source.\\" On January 31, 2019, Rossi‚Äôs company released a new product (E-Cat SK) via live video stream. The product is reported as currently available to be leased by factories as a source of heat. After viewing the video, Tom Casten noted that ‚ÄúThe -E-Cat demonstration makes giant claims of scientific breakthroughs with no validation.‚Äù Similarly, the Australian physicist and aerospace engineer Ian Bryce noted that, in the video demonstration, the ‚Äúinputs, outputs, and measurement points are not defined, making the results largely meaningless‚Äù, that the nuclear reaction purportedly occurring within the E-Cat SK would ‚Äúrelease much deadly radiation. Yet the meters show zero ionizing radiation and no neutrons. Fortunate for the bystanders!‚Äù and concludes, regarding Rossi‚Äôs E-Cat cold fusion device, ‚Äúthere is no real doubt about it being a fake.‚Äù  Reactions to the claims  Theoretical astrophysicist Ethan Siegel and nuclear physicist Peter Thieberger have pointed out that the claims for the E-Cat are incompatible with the fundamentals of nuclear physics.Ethan Siegel, 2011-12-05, The Physics of why the E-Cat's Cold Fusion Claims Collapse Jennifer Ouellette, Could starships use cold fusion propulsion? // HowStuffWorks, () In particular, the Coulomb barrier for the claimed fusion reaction is so high that it is insurmountable anywhere in the known universe, including the interior of stars. The reaction also would create gamma radiation that would have penetrated the few inches of shielding apparently provided by the E-Cat, inducing acute radiation syndrome in persons in the vicinity of the purported demonstrations. Given numerous other scientific inconsistencies ‚Äì such as the ratio of isotopes in the supposed copper \\"fusion product\\" being identical to that in natural copper ‚Äì the authors argued that it is now time \\"for the E-Cat's proponents to provide the provable, testable, reproducible science that can answer these straightforward physics objections.\\" Peter Ekstr√∂m, lecturer at the Department of Nuclear Physics at Lund University in Sweden, concluded in May 2011, \\"I am convinced that the whole story is one big scam, and that it will be revealed in less than one year.\\" He cited the unlikelihood of a chemical reaction being strong enough to overcome the Coulomb barrier, the lack of gamma rays, the lack of explanation for the origin of the extra energy, the lack of the expected radioactivity after fusing a proton with 58Ni, the unexplained occurrence of 11% iron in the spent fuel, the 10% copper in the spent fuel strangely having the same isotopic ratios as natural copper, and the lack of any unstable copper isotope in the spent fuel as if the reactor only produced stable isotopes. Kjell Aleklett, physics professor at Uppsala University, said the percentage of copper was too high for any known reaction of nickel, and the copper had the same isotopic ratio as natural copper. He also stated, \\"Known chemical reactions cannot explain the amount of energy measured. A nuclear reaction can explain the amount of energy, but the knowledge we have today says that this reaction cannot take place.\\"Aleklett, Kjell (11 April 2011). \\"Rossi energy catalyst ‚Äì a big hoax or new physics?\\". Aleklett's Energy Mix (a WordPress blog). Retrieved on 10 July 2011. Scientific skeptic James Randi, discussing the E-Cat in the context of previous cold fusion claims, suggested that it will eventually be proven to be a fraud. Starting ~7:30 Randi says: \\"But I... I predict that, as I said just a moment ago there, that this man [Rossi] will probably go on the stock market and sell all kinds of shares and issue all kinds of wonderful reports left and right and, um, the reports will influence everybody‚Äîer, not everybody‚Äîbut those who have money to waste and, uh, they will invest in it and then gradually it will become apparent to everybody: 'Gee, maybe it doesn't work'.\\" Other cold fusion supporters have been more supportive of the claims. For example, in 2011 Dennis M. Bushnell, Chief Scientist at NASA Langley Research Center, described LENR as a \\"promising\\" technology and praised the work of Rossi and Focardi.The Future of Energy: Part 1 Podcast approved Transcript. At 4 minutes and 34 seconds, Bushnell described several emerging energy technologies, but he identified LENR as \\"the most interesting and promising at this point\\". At 10 minutes and 35 seconds, Bushnell continued: \\"... in January of this year Rossi, backed by Focardi, who had been working on this for many years, and in fact doing some of the best work worldwide, came out and did a demonstration first in January, they re-did it in February, they re-did it in March, where for days they had one of these cells, a small cell, producing in the 10 to 15 kilowatts range, which is far more than enough heat to boil water for tea.\\" Theoretical nuclear physicist Yeong E.

A pupil of Gianni Vattimo, and influenced by Jacques Derrida, Ferraris began as a theorist of hermeneutics before turning his attention to analytic philosophy. Over the years he has been able to create an effective synthesis between the two approaches, creating a new ontological realism that rejects Kant's schematism in the domain of cognition. Since 1995, Ferraris has been Professor of Philosophy in the Department of Literature and Philosophy at the University of Turin, where he also runs the LabOnt (Laboratory for Ontology). He studied in Turin, Paris and Heidelberg and has taught at major European Universities. He is the editor of the Rivista di Estetica and is a member of the editorial board of Critique and aut aut. From 1989 to 2010 Ferraris contributed regularly to the cultural supplement of the Italian newspaper Il Sole 24 ORE. Since 2010 he has been writing for the cultural section of La Repubblica. His main areas of expertise are hermeneutics, aesthetics and ontology. Biography Ferraris graduated from philosophy at the University of Turin in 1979, under the guidance of Gianni Vattimo. In the early years of his career he divided his time between teaching, research and cultural journalism. From 1979 to 1988 he has been an editor, and then co- director, of Alfabeta, whose directive committee includes, among others, Antonio Porta, Nanni Balestrini, Maria Corti, Umberto Eco, Francesco Leonetti, Pier Aldo Rovatti and Paolo Volponi. In the early eighties he began his relationship with Derrida, who deeply marked his philosophical training. On the academic level, in 1984, after two years of teaching in Macerata (1982‚Äì83), he began to teach in Trieste, interspersing his didactic activities with a series of stays in Heidelberg. Here, after getting in contact with Gadamer, he started his studies in hermeneutics. In 1995, Ferraris was called in Turin, as a full Professor of Aesthetics, and later began teaching Metaphysics (Filosofia teoretica) in 1999. While working as a director of program (i.e. teacher) at the Coll√®ge international de philosophie from 1998 to 2004, in 1999 he founded the Laboratory for Ontology (LabOnt) and the Inter-University Centre for Theoretical and Applied Ontology (CTAO). Currently Ferraris is full Professor of Philosophy at the University of Turin, where he is also the President of the LabOnt (Laboratory for Ontology) and of the Centre for Theoretical and Applied Ontology (CTAO). He is a Fellow of K√§te Hamburger Kolleg ‚ÄúRecht als Kultur‚Äù (Bonn) and a Honorary Fellow of the Center for Advanced Studies of South East Europe (Rijeka). Ferraris has been Fellow of the Italian Academy for Advanced Studies in America and of the Alexander von Humboldt Stiftung. He has also been Directeur d‚Äô√©tudes of the Coll√®ge International de Philosophie and a Visiting Professor at the √âcole des Hautes √âtudes en Sciences Sociales (Paris) as well as other European and American Universities. Ferraris is a columnist for ‚ÄòLa Repubblica‚Äô, the Director of ‚ÄòRivista di Estetica‚Äô, and the Co-director of ‚ÄòCritique‚Äô and the ‚ÄòRevue francophone d‚Äôesth√©tique‚Äô. He wrote more than fifty books that have been translated into several languages. The books that have appeared in English are: History of Hermeneutics (Humanities Press, 1996), Documentality or Why it is Necessary to Leave Traces (Fordham UP, 2012), Goodbye Kant! (SUNY UP, 2013); Where Are You? An Ontology of the Cell Phone (Fordham UP, 2015) and Manifesto of New Realism (SUNY UP, 2015). Maurizio Ferraris has worked in the field of aesthetics, hermeneutics and social ontology, attaching his name to the theory of documentality, and contemporary new realism. Thought Ferraris‚Äô early interests lay in French post-structuralist philosophy, with special attention to authors such as Jean-Fran√ßois Lyotard, Michel Foucault, Jacques Lacan and Gilles Deleuze. A special role in the formation of his thought was undoubtedly played by Jacques Derrida, with whom Ferraris has maintained a relationship of research, later turned into a friendship, since 1981. Evidence of this phase of his thought can be found in his early works: Differenze (1981), Tracce (1983) and La svolta testuale (1984). Ferraris has specifically dedicated to Derrida: Postille a Derrida (1990), Honoris causa a Derrida (1998), Introduzione a Derrida (2003), Il gusto del segreto (1997) [A Taste for the Secret, Blackwell 2001] and, finally, Jackie Derrida. Ritratto a memoria (2006). While working with Gadamer, starting in the early eighties, Ferraris then turned to hermeneutics, writing: Aspetti dell‚Äôermeneutica del Novecento (1986), Ermeneutica di Proust (1987), Nietzsche e la filosofia del Novecento (1989) and especially Storia dell‚Äôermeneutica (1988) History of Hermeneutics, Humanities Press, 1996 The turning point  At the end of the eighties, Ferraris developed an articulated critique of Heidegger and Gadamer's tradition (see, in particular, Cronistoria di una svolta, the 1990 afterword to Heidegger's conference ‚ÄúThe Turn‚Äù), which makes use of post- structuralism to challenge the romantic and idealistic legacy affecting such tradition. The conclusion of this critical path led the philosopher to the reconsideration of the relationship between the spirit and the letter as well as to a reversal of their traditional opposition. Oftentimes, both philosophers and ordinary people despise the letter (the rules and constraints instituted through documents and inscriptions of various kinds) and set the spirit (i.e. thought and will) above it, recognizing the creative freedom of the latter as opposed to the former. For Ferraris, it is the letter that precedes and founds the spirit. Thus occurred the transition to the second phase of the thought of the Italian philosopher. Ferraris abandoned hermeneutic relativism and Derridean deconstruction to embrace a form of realistic objectivism according to which \\"objectivity and reality, considered by radical hermeneutics as principles of violence and abuse, are in fact ‚Äì and precisely because of the contraposition between spirit and letter mentioned above ‚Äì the only protection against arbitrariness\\".\\"Maurizio Ferraris\\", in D. Antiseri e S. Tagliagambe (a cura di), Filosofi italiani contemporanei, Milano: Bompiani, pp. 226-235. This principle, which applies to morals, is based on the acknowledgement of a sphere of reality that is independent of interpretations (see, in particular, L‚Äôermeneutica, 1998). The external world, recognized as unamendable, and the relationship between conceptual schemes and sensory experience (aesthetics, restored to its etymological meaning of \\"science of sensory perception\\", acquires a primary significance ‚Äì see, in particular, Analogon rationis (1994 ), Estetica (1996, with other authors), L‚Äôimmaginazione (1996), Experimentelle √Ñsthetik (2001) and Estetica razionale (1997)) are the dominant themes of the second phase of Ferraris‚Äô thought, which involves a re-reading of Kant through the naive physics of the perceptologist Paolo Bozzi (see Il mondo esterno (2001) and Goodbye Kant!(2004, forthcoming for SUNY Press)). Ferraris‚Äô \\"critical ontology\\" recognizes the world of everyday life as largely impenetrable compared to conceptual schemes. The failure to acknowledge this principle traces back to the confusion between ontology (the sphere of being) and epistemology (the sphere of knowledge); such confusion is critically thematised by Ferraris starting from the character of unamendability that is typical of being as opposed to knowledge (see in particular: Ontologia (2003) and Storia dell‚Äôontologia (2008, with other authors)). His reflection on realism led, in 2011, to the elaboration of the Manifesto of New Realism.\\"Maurizio Ferraris\\", la Repubblica, 8 August 2011, http:/ / www. alfabeta2. it/ 2011/ 09/ 09/ manifesto-del-new-realism/ #more-1513. For the full press review of the debate surrounding the \\"Manifesto of New Realism\\" see http:/ / labont. it/ dibattito- sul-nuovo-realismo. From social ontology to documentality The natural outcome of critical ontology is the twofold acknowledgement of the external world as unamendable and of the domain of objects which Kantian transcendental philosophy rightly applies to: that of social objects. This new phase of Ferraris‚Äô thought was ideally inaugurated with the publication of Dove sei? Ontologia del telefonino (2005) [Where are you? Ontology of the Cell Phone, forthcoming for Fordham UP] and went on with Babbo Natale, Ges√π adulto (2006), Sans Papier (2007), La fidanzata automatica (2007) and Il tunnel delle multe (2008). The basic thesis is that the distinction between ontology and epistemology, combined with the acknowledgment of the ontological autonomy of the sphere of social objects (regulated by the constitutive law \\"object = inscribed act\\"), allows for the correction of Derrida's thesis that \\"there is nothing outside the text \\"(literally, and asemantically,\\"there is no outside text\\") so as to theorize, against Searle, that ‚Äúthere is nothing social outside the text.\\" This leads to the mature stage of Ferraris‚Äô thought, fully exposed and systematized in what may be considered his summa: Documentalit√†. Perch√© √® necessario lasciar tracce (2009) [Documentality. Why It Is Necessary to Leave Traces, Fordham UP, 2010] - and a monographic issue of the ‚Äö‚ÄúMonist‚Äú (Edited by Maurizio Ferraris and Leonardo Caffo).http://www.themonist.com/wp- content/uploads/2010/06/97-2CFP.html Documentality The most influential ontology of social reality, formulated by the American philosopher John Searle (1995), is based on collective intentionality, which allegedly ensures that certain physical objects (e.g. a piece of paper) are transformed into social objects (e.g. a banknote). As noted by Barry Smith (2003), this perspective has difficulty in accounting for both negative entities ‚Äì such as debts, which apparently do not have a physical counterpart ‚Äì and the new, seemingly intangible, social objects generated by the Web. The theory of documentality proposed by Maurizio Ferraris (2005) aims to solve these problems by arguing that social objects are always recordings of social acts. This accounts for both negative entities and the virtual entities of the web, which consist precisely of recordings just like any other social object. For the theory of documentality, the constitutive rule of social reality is \\"Object = Inscribed Act\\", where ‚Äúinscribed‚Äù is equal to ‚Äúrecorded‚Äù. That is: a social object is the result of a social act (such as to involve at least two people), which is characterized by its being recorded on some support, including the minds of the people involved in the act (in the case of informal social acts such as promises). Articulated by Ferraris (2009) in a complete ontological theory and by Smith ( 2012) in a theory of document acts, documentality has three main reasons of interest. First, it has been able to account for the substantial growth of documents and recording devices in the Web world, which is very well explained by the proposed constitutive law of social reality. Secondly, it has been able to explain why social reality, while requiring the presence of subjects for the enactment of acts, may develop independently from them and even without their knowledge (an economic recession can be taking place even if no human subject is aware of it). Third, instead of making social reality depend on the action of collective intentionality ‚Äì with an increasing social constructivism (Searle 2010) ‚Äì documentality is capable of substantiating a \\"new realism\\" (Ferraris, 2012) that helps continental philosophy come out of the impasses of postmodernism and reconnect with analytic philosophy. [Source of this description of documentality: L. Caffo, \\"From Documentality to New Realism\\", in The Monist, 97:2 April 2014]. New realism The realist turn carried out by Maurizio Ferraris starting from the formulation of aesthetics not as philosophy of art, but as ontology of perception and sensory experience (Estetica razionalehttp:/ / labont. it/ publication/ estetica 1997 new edition 2011), finds a further declination in the Manifesto del nuovo realismo (2012) [Manifesto of new realism, SUNY Press, 2014]. New Realism ‚Äì the principles of which were anticipated by Ferraris in an article published in La Repubblica on August 8, 2011http:/ / ricerca. repubblica. it/ repubblica/ archivio/ repubblica/ 2011/ 08/ 08/ il-ritorno-al-pensiero-forte. html and which then started a massive debatehttp:/ / nuovorealismo. wordpress. com/ ‚Äì is primarily a consideration of some historical, cultural and political phenomena (i.e. the analysis of postmodernism up to its deteriorating into media populism). From these reflections follows the urge to shed light over the outcomes produced by the derivations of postmodernism within contemporary thought (i.e. the interpretation of philosophical realisms and \\"theories of truth\\" that developed starting from the end of last century in response to a deviation of the relationship between the individual and reality). This, in turn, leads to the proposal of an antidote to the degeneration of postmodernist ideology and the degraded and mendacious relationship with the world that it has caused: New Realism, in fact, identifies itself with the synergistic action of three key words, Ontology, Critique and Enlightenment. New Realism has been the subject of several debates and national and international conferences and has called for a series of publications that involve the concept of reality as a paradigm even in non-philosophical areas. In fact, the debate on new realism, for number of contributions and media response, has no equivalent in the recent cultural history, to the point of being chosen as 'case study' for the analysis of the sociology of communication and linguistics.See R. Scarpa, Il caso Nuovo Realismo. La lingua del dibattito filosofico contemporaneo,Milano- Udine, Mimesis, 2013. In the international arena, the Manifesto of new realism can be found in several translations: English (SUNYI Press), French (Hermann), German (Klostermann), Spanish (Biblioteca Nueva) ecc. New realism was discussed in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, in the Neue Z√ºrcher Zeitung and the S√ºddeutsche Zeitung.These and other references can be found here: http:/ / nuovorealismo. wordpress. com/ rassegna/ 2013-2/ A monographic issue of the ‚Äö‚ÄúMonist‚Äú (Edited by Maurizio Ferraris and Mario De Caro) will also shortly appear.http:/ / www. themonist. com/ wp-content/ uploads/ 2010/ 06/ 98-4CFP. html Furthermore, the topic was re-elaborated both in Warum es die Welt nicht gibt by Markus Gabriel (Berlin, Ullstein Verlag 2013) and in Manifiesto del nuevo realismo anal√≥gico (Buenos Aires, Circulo Herm√©neutico 2013) by Mauricio Beuchot (M√©xico-UNAM) and Jos√© Luis Jerez (Argentina-UNCo). History: In the frame of hermeneutics, as a reaction against its constructivist or nihilistic outcomes, Maurizio Ferraris has proposed the so- called \\"New Realism\\" (Manifesto del nuovo realismo, 2012), a philosophical orientation shared by both analytic philosophers ‚Äì such as Mario De Caro (see Bentornata Realt√†, ed by De Caro and Ferraris, 2012), and continental philosophers, such as Mauricio Beuchot (Manifesto del realismo analogico, 2013), and Markus Gabriel (Fields of Sense: A New Realist Ontology, 2014). New Realism also garnered the support of great thinkers such as Umberto Eco, Hilary Putnam and John Searle, intersecting with other realistic movements that arose independently but responding to similar needs, such as the \\"speculative realism\\" defended by the French philosopher Quentin Meillassoux and the American philosopher Graham Harman. For New Realism, the fact that it is becoming increasingly clear that science is not systematically the ultimate measure of truth and reality does not mean that we should say goodbye to reality, truth or objectivity, as was posited by much twentieth century philosophy. Rather, it means that philosophy, as well as jurisprudence, linguistics or history, has something important and true to say about the world. In this context, New Realism presents itself primarily as a negative realism: the resistance that the outside world opposes to our conceptual schemes should not be seen as a failure, but as a resource ‚Äì a proof of the existence of an independent world. If this is the case, however, this negative realism turns into a positive realism: in resisting us reality does not merely set a limit we cannot trespass, but it also offers opportunities and resources. This explains how, in the natural world, different life-forms can interact in the same environment without sharing any conceptual scheme and how, in the social world, human intentions and behaviors are made possible by a reality that is first given, and that only at a later time may be interpreted and, if necessary, transformed. Now that the season of postmodernism has died out, New Realism expresses the widespread need for renewal in extra-disciplinary areas such as architecture, literature, pedagogy and medicine.

It was immediately west of the former Israeli settlement of Ganei Tal, and named after the former Israeli settlement area of Gush Katif. Following the destruction of the Yasser Arafat International Airport it was briefly the only usable runway in the Gaza Strip, but in 2004 it was abandoned, and was overbuilt by 2015. History The airstrip should not be confused with RAF Gaza, which was in the vicinity of the present day Karni Crossing. After the 1948 Palestinian exodus, 35,000 refugees took shelter in a camp to the south of the present day airfield. This has become the UNRWA Khan Younis camp. As part of the unilateral disengagement of Israel from Gaza, Israeli settlers were evicted from the Gush Katif area in 2005. In 2004, the airfield was in a good state of repair. The runway was kept clear, and runway markings were maintained. Following the handover to the Palestinian authorities along with the rest of Gush Katif, the airstrip was no longer maintained. It became partially covered by sand and reduced from a width of to approximately of usable tarmac, and the overrun and backtracking loop at the northwest end became blocked with sand. Present day The UNRWA Khan Younis refugee camp is adjacent to and south of the former airstrip, and the UNRWA Khan Younis Vocational Training Centre, built in 2007, is immediately south of the runway. The camp houses over 68,000 refugees.http://www.unrwa.org/etemplate.php?id=81 UNRWA - Khan Younis refugee camp In 2010 the main runway was still sufficiently clear to be used, due to its use as an access road for UNRWA Khan Younis. By 2014, it was clear from aerial imagery that expansion of UNRWA Khan Younis, including a sewage treatment plant constructed on the former runway threshold, made it entirely unusable.

No Orchids For Miss Blandish is a 1939 crime novel by the British writer James Hadley Chase.Bloom p.144 The novel was influenced by the American crime writer James M. Cain and the stories in the pulp magazine Black Mask. Chase reportedly wrote the book as a bet to out-do The Postman Always Rings Twice. The 1948 novel The Flesh of the Orchid by the same author is a sequel to this novel. No Orchids for Miss Blandish provoked considerable controversy because of its explicit depiction of sexuality and violence.Stableford pp. 130-138 The novel was a great critical success and was included in the Le Monde's 100 Books of the Century. In 1942, the novel was adapted into a stage play which ran for over 200 performances at the Prince of Wales Theatre in London.Chibnall & Murphy p. 37 Robert Newton starred. In 1948, it was adapted into a British film No Orchids for Miss Blandish and given a contemporary New York City setting. The 1971 American film The Grissom Gang was also based on the novel, moving the setting of events back several years to 1931 Kansas City. In 1944, it was also the subject of an essay by George Orwell, Raffles and Miss Blandish, and parodied by Raymond Queneau in We Always Treat Women Too Well. In 1962 the novel was extensively rewritten and rearranged by the author because he thought the world of 1939 too distant for a new generation of readers. (Confusion can result if readers of the Orwell essay refer his quotations and references to the 1962 edition.:fr:Pas d'orchid√©es pour miss Blandish) Development Gene D.

Synopsis Local goon Riley and his sidekicks decide to hit a jackpot by stealing multimillionaire John Blandish's daughter's necklace. They do manage to get her until things begin to go murky when they have to kidnap her and her compatriot, and the latter gets accidentally killed during the kidnap; and an even more deadly gangster mob headed by Ma Grisson and her psychopathic son Slim Grisson decide to snatch Miss Blandish from Riley's gang and hold her ransom instead. Soon the police are on the trail of the kidnappers, and Dave Fenner, an ex journalist and now a private investigator, is roped in by John Blandish himself to rescue his daughter and deal with the gangsters.

This Pfam family represents a protein domain which shows homology to the yeast protein SacI . The SacI homology domain is most notably found at the amino terminal of the inositol 5'-phosphatase synaptojanin. Synaptic vesicles are recycled with remarkable speed and precision in nerve terminals. A major recycling pathway involves clathrin-mediated endocytosis at endocytic zones located around sites of release. Different 'accessory' proteins linked to this pathway have been shown to alter the shape and composition of lipid membranes, to modify membrane-coat protein interactions, and to influence actin polymerization. These include the GTPase dynamin, the lysophosphatidic acid acyl transferase endophilin, and the phosphoinositide phosphatase synaptojanin. The recessive suppressor of secretory defect in yeast Golgi and yeast actin function belongs to this family. This protein may be involved in the coordination of the activities of the secretory pathway and the actin cytoskeleton. Human synaptojanin which may be localised on coated endocytic intermediates in nerve terminals also belongs to this family.

It is used as a biomarker in the serum to measure the rate of bone turnover. It can be useful in assisting clinicians to determine a patient's nonsurgical treatment response as well as evaluate a patient's risk of developing complications during healing following surgical intervention.Marx, RE, et al. _Oral Bisphosphonate-Induced Osteonecrosis: Risk Factors, Prediction of Risk Using Serum CTX Testing, Prevention, and Treatment_ , J Oral Maxillofac Surg 2007;65:2397-2410 The test used to detect the CTX marker is called the Serum CrossLaps, and it is more specific to bone resorption than any other test currently available.Rosen, HN, et al. _Serum CTX. A new marker of bone resorption that shows treatment effect more often than other markers because of low coefficient of variability and large changes with bisphosphonate therapy_. Calcif Tissue Int 2000;66:100 Biomarker discovery In the early 2000s, a link between bisphosphonate use and impaired bone physiology was noted.Marx, RE, et al. _Pamidronate (Aredia) and zoledronate (Zometa) induced avascular necrosis of the jaws: A growing epidemic_. J Oral Maxillofac Surg 2003;61:1115Ruggerio, SL, et al. _Osteonecrosis of the jaws associated with the use of bisphosphonates: A review of 63 cases_. J Oral Maxillofac Surg 2004;62:527 The strong inhibition of osteoclast function precipitated by bisphosphonate therapy can lead to inhibition of normal bone turnover, leading to impaired wound healing following trauma (such as dental surgery) or even spontaneous non-healing bone exposure. Because bisphosphonates are preferentially deposited in bone with high turnover rates, it is possible that the levels of bisphosphonate within the jaw bones are selectively elevated.Ruggiero, SL. _Bisphosphonate-related Osteonecrosis of the Jaws_. Compendium 2008;29(2):97‚Äì105. With the advent of implant dentistry, more dental patients are undergoing therapies in the oral cavity that involve bone healing, such as surgical implant placement and bone grafting procedures. In order to evaluate the risk of osteonecrosis for a patient taking bisphosphonates, use of the CTX biomarker was introduced in 2000 by Rosen. Use as a biomarker Although a number of surrogate biomarkers exist for measuring the metabolic products of bone resorption, the serum CTX marker was chosen because it is both highly correlated to bone turnover rate and already available for detection in a laboratory test carried out by a major lab testing corporation. The CTX test measures for the presence and concentration of a crosslink peptide sequence of type I collagen, found, among other tissues, in bone. This specific peptide sequence relates to bone turnover because it is the portion that is cleaved by osteoclasts during bone resorption, and its serum levels are therefore proportional to osteoclastic activity at the time the blood sample is drawn. Serum levels in healthy patients not taking bisphosphonates tends to hover above 300 pg/mL. Patients who are placed on a 6-month drug holiday exhibit marked improvements in their serum CTX values; in one study, patients showed an improvement of 155.3 pg/mL over 6 months or a rate of 25.9 pg/mL each month. Initially, urinary CTX levels were sought, but this proved to offer no greater value than urinary NTX values‚Äîboth tests suffered from large spontaneous fluctuations unrelated to therapy or intervention, and were therefore largely unreliable.Ju, H, et al. _Comparison of analytical performance and biological variability of three bone resorption assays_. Clin Chem 1997;43:1570‚Äì1576 In contrast, the monoclonal antibody test for detecting serum CTX levels features minimal spontaneous disruption yet remarkable change to antiresorptive therapy, making the serum CTX assay both highly sensitive and specific.

Functions and interactions  The content of phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,5)P2) in endosomal membranes changes dynamically with fission and fusion events that generate or absorb intracellular transport vesicles. The ArPIKfyve protein scaffolds a trimolecular complex to tightly regulate the level of PtdIns(3,5)P2. Other components of this complex are the PtdIns(3,5)P2-synthesizing enzyme PIKFYVE and the Sac1-domain-containing PtdIns(3,5)P2 5-phosphatase Sac3, encoded by the human gene FIG4. VAC14 functions as an activator of PIKFYVE. Studies in VAC14 knockout mice indicate that, in addition to increasing the PtdIns(3,5)P2-producing activity of PIKfyve, VAC14 also controls the steady-state levels of another rare phosphoinositide linked to PIKfyve enzyme activity ‚Äì phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate. In addition to the formation of the ternary complex with PIKfyve and Sac3, ArPIKfyve is engaged in a number of other interactions. ArPIKfyve forms a stable complex with the PtdIns(3,5)P2-specific phosphatase Sac3, thereby protecting Sac3 from rapid degradation in the proteasome. ArPIKfyve forms a homooligomer through its carboxyl terminus. However, the number of monomers in the ArPIKfyve homooligomer, ArPIKfyve-Sac3 heterodimer or PIKfyve- ArPIKfyve-Sac3 heterotrimer is unknown. Human Vac14/ArPIKfyve also interacts with the PDZ (post-synaptic density) domain of neuronal nitric oxide synthase but the functional significance of this interaction is still unclear. ArPIKfyve facilitates insulin-regulated GLUT4 translocation to the cell surface.  Lessons from VAC14 mouse models  VAC14 knock-out mice die at, or shortly after birth and exhibit massive neurodegeneration. Fibroblasts from these mice display ~50% lower levels of PtdIns(3,5)P2 and PtdIns(5)P. A spontaneous mouse VAC14-point mutation (with arginine substitution of leucine156) is associated with reduced life span (up to 3 weeks), body size, enlarged brain ventricles, 50% decrease in PtdIns(3,5)P2 levels, diluted pigmentation, tremor and impaired motor function.  VAC14 and human disease  The VAC14 gene is yet to be linked convincingly to human disease.

Indiramma, n√©e Indiramma Srinivasa Iyengar, was the eldest of the three children of Srinivasa Iyengar and Sowmyanaki; her siblings were a younger brother, Sampath, and a younger sister, Padma. She graduated from the Lower Secondary school in Kollegal in 1926. On February 26, 1926, she married 18-year-old H. R. Janardhana Iyengar, son of Haradanahalli Ramaswamy Iyengar and Janakamma. Her husband would become a successful engineer, contractor, architect, designer, and also an established philanthropist in Mysore. After marriage, she lived in Bangalore until 1940, in a joint family, and then moved with the family to Mysore, where she remained permanently. She had five sons‚ÄîRamaswamy (born 1934), Srinivas (1938), Rangaraj (1940), Krishnamurthy (1942) and Prakash (1944)--and two daughters: Rathna (wife of K. K. Srinivasan; 1936) and Lavanya born in 1950. She had fifteen grandchildren, who now reside in the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and India. Throughout her life, she ardently followed the Srivaishnava philosophy and Hebbar Iyengar customs and traditions. Although not a professional Carnatic musician, she was a respected singer, notably of Devarnamas. Indiramma was also a follower the teachings of Ramanujacharya, with expertise in the Gadhya Thrayams, Vaikunta Gadyam, Saranagati Gadyam and the Sriranga Gadyam. Under the tutelage of her mother-in-law and mother, Indiramma became well-versed in the Bhagavad Gita and the Bhagavatha Purana. Manni was conscientiously active in festivals and traditions, such as reading the Ramayana and performing the Rama Pattabhishekam on Vijayadashami during Mysore Dasara, which she performed infallibly for decades. While raising seven successful children with her husband, she devoted herself to hospitality, generosity, and kindness, opening her home for to a multitude of people as they worked and studied in Mysore, and providing financial and material support to the Mysore community; throughout her life, she was a respected member and a point of light in the community.

These were the arms of Hugh Courtenay, 2nd Earl of Devon (d.1377), and can be seen impaling Bohun on the monumental brass of one of his younger sons Sir Peter Courtenay (d.1405), [KG] in Exeter Cathedral Sir Philip Courtenay ( ‚Äì 29 July 1406), of Powderham, Devon was the fifth son of Hugh Courtenay, 10th Earl of Devon (1303‚Äì1377). He was the founder of the cadet dynasty known as \\"Courtenay of Powderham\\", seated at the manor of Powderham, until then a former Bohun manor of little importance, whilst the line descended from his elder brother, the Earls of Devon of the mediaeval era, continued to be seated at Tiverton Castle and Okehampton. Origins Sir Philip Courtenay was the fifth son of eight sons of Hugh Courtenay, 10th Earl of Devon (1303‚Äì1377) and Margaret de Bohun, daughter of Humphrey de Bohun, 4th Earl of Hereford by his wife Elizabeth Plantagenet (1282‚Äì1316), a daughter of King Edward I.; . Military and naval career He was known as a rash, angry and temperamental man but was skillful in naval and military affairs. Philip served during the Spanish War. He was with Edward the Black Prince at the famous victory of the Battle of Najera. He was knighted before the battle with his brothers Peter Courtenay, K.G., and Hugh Courtenay, K.G. On his return Sir Philip was made Admiral of the West on 7 October 1372 responsible for defending a coast plagued by pirates he held that post until 16 July 1376. In 1373 he was put in charge of a large supply convoy to Gascony. In August, the expedition took the Castle of Gurry. Back in England, he launched a petition to parliament protesting against corruption of the Stannaries, which he claimed was preventing protection and patrol of the coastline. That August, Philip was engaged with Peter in a desperate battle against the Spaniards during which they were both captured as supplies failed to get through to Gascony. Two Bristol burgesses paid a large ransom for their release. In return they were granted trading exemptions from customs tax. On 8 March 1380 he was once again appointed Admiral of the West till 1381. In February 1383, he became Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, serving for 10 years under King Richard II. He attended the parliament that met at Salisbury in April 1384, but in July his duties were taken over by the deputies. In 1385 the King gave him powers of administration in Dublin. He did not stay long and returned to London on 6 May. That Christmas the Great Council met to discuss charges of extortion levelled at Courtenay. In January 1386 he was dismissed from his post, arrested by the Crown in March. Sir Robert de Vere was created Marquess of Dublin and Viceroy. By 1387, De Vere was styling himself as duke of Ireland. Courtenay was elected to the Commons in October 1386, and petitioned against the perceived injustice. He received compensation for the loss of Ireland. By the end of 1387, the Lords Appellant had banished de Vere. Landholdings Courtenay also served as Steward of Cornwall in the 12th year of the reign of Richard II. Pope Urban VI challenged the English to join a Crusade in 1383. John of Gaunt opposed any such venture; whereas the clerical party was supported by Henry le Despencer, Bishop of Norwich and Sir Philip Courtenay. Gaunt made the Priory of Somborne over to the Courtenays. There in Hampshire they attacked and tortured the Carmelites, and when they accused Gaunt of treason, the knights caused the death of the Friar. It was perhaps as well for his privilege that Sir Philip was elected to parliament in February 1383, for he was not a favourite of Richard II. Edward III had granted him a pension of ¬£100 for life, which was confirmed by Richard II in 1378. The Black Prince had granted him two annuities of ¬£50 each from the Duchy of Cornwall, which were doubled on his marriage in 1393. Richard II demanded his presence in parliament because he had been given the official post of Keeper of Dartmoor Forest in 1370, and granted substantial estates in Devon from 1380. In March 1388, he received four parks, which he forfeited to the Merciless Parliament. In 1389 he was given the post of Lord Warden of the Stannaries and granted the Royal Manor of Haslebury Plucknett for a period of six years. In 1391, the manor of Dartmoor and manor of Bradninch were granted to him and his wife, for the sum of ¬£39 p/a. All these landholding decisions were confirmed by Henry IV. In December 1404, the King ordered Philip to grant Dartmoor and Bradninch to Henry, Prince of Wales. Ireland Courtenay was still Steward of the Duchy of Cornwall until 1392. Two years later he was preparing to go on an expedition with the king to Ireland. Philip was in charge of royal household arrangements as the steward. He was to this end commissioned to find fish from Devon and Cornwall for provisions. Whilst in Ireland he soon fell out with Robert de Vere, Duke of Ireland, the royal favourite, and was removed as royal troops commissioner. He also clashed with Robert Wikeford, the Archbishop of Dublin. Military experience By 1399 Sir Philip was an experienced soldier called upon to suppress the Welsh revolt. He called up the Commissions of Array. He bought transporters of the soldiers and horses for the 1402 expedition to Brittany, and the sailing against the King of Scotland in 1400. Politician He criticised ships lying idle in the docks, and reported to the Royal Council. They urged Henry IV to bring the experience of the West Country men in provisioning stores against France in 1402. Sir Philip also sat on the Council of 1405. Despite falling into terrible debts governing Ireland, he was exonerated of any crimes and pardoned by the King in 1393. When two men were dispossessed of their property Philip encouraged arbitrators Sir Peter Chudleigh and Sir James Chudleigh MP to decide. Many men complained of Courtenay's conduct: Sir Thomas Pomeroy was returned some property lost in Exeter in 1402. And Nicholas Potyngton managed to renew his complaint of 1393 for the loss of the manor of Bickleigh. Abbot of Newenham's property was stolen by sixty retainers; Courtenay ignored the summons to appear in Westminster. This he also did when summoned to answer for his conduct in forbidding the Abbot of Beaulieu access to his abbey. Imprisonment Sir Philip was imprisoned in the Tower in November 1402 for clerical abuses against the Church. On 29 November he was forced to pay a recognizance of ¬£100 by Sir John Arundell, and to Sir John Herle and Sir William Sturmy a surety of ¬£1000. Inheritance Philip had been very fortunate to receive property on the death of relatives. In 1357 he received the reversion of the manor of Moreton on the death of his brother, Thomas. In 1374 he had gained Broadwindsor and Cadleigh on the death of his brother, Sir Peter Courtenay, and the reversion of Honiton and Nuneham Courtenay, and East Coker. The Earl left him 100 marks in his will. In 1377, Sir Philip returned advowsons of Honiton and East Coker to Exeter Cathedral to construct a memorial to his father. His mother also left him seven manors from 1391 as well as her chapel. Philip was granted Powderham Castle by his mother upon her death in 1391, as well as seven other manors. He was succeeded by his son, Richard, Lord Chancellor and Bishop of Ireland, upon his death on 29 July 1406. At that time he held one manor and hamlet in Dorset; three manors and a moiety and three advowsons in Somerset; and seventeen manors and five advowsons in Devon with some smaller properties.

Opened on , the system was one of the most extensive trolleybus systems in the United Kingdom, with a total of 14 routes, and a maximum fleet of 173 trolleybuses. For a brief period in the 1930s, it even had the distinction of being the world's largest trolleybus system. It was closed on . History Prior to 1923, Wolverhampton had run a tramway system and a number of motorbuses. Included in the motorbus fleet were a small number of petrol-electric vehicles, manufactured by Tilling-Stevens of Maidstone. The General Manager of the municipal transport section was Charles Owen Silvers, and he was sufficiently impressed by the performance of the vehicles that he pressed for a system where the petrol engines were replaced by overhead wires. The short, single-track tramway route from Princes Square to Rookery Bridge in Wednesfield was in need of reconstruction, and in April 1923 the town council approved the conversion of the route to their first trolleybus line. Although the Corporation had no powers to run trolleybuses, the Ministry of Transport allowed the scheme to be implemented, providing a clause to permit such operation was included in their next Parliamentary Bill. Rookery Bridge was widened and the route was extended from the original to , terminating at Pinfold Bridge. Tramcars over the route were withdrawn, to be replaced by motor buses while the conversion work took place. The route was hampered by a low railway bridge, and so six single-deck vehicles were obtained from Tilling-Stevens, which were fitted with Dodson centre-entrance bodies. A formal opening ceremony for the service was held on 29 October 1923. The Corporation next turned their attention to the single-track tramway route from Waterloo Road to Bushbury, which was to be extended by about along Stafford Road. The extension would serve a developing area, but since part of the tramway and all of the extension were outside of the Corporation's area of responsibility, agreement had to be reached with Staffordshire County Council. Trams on the route were withdrawn in August 1924, with motor buses being used while the conversion took place. of new trolleybus route were opened on 9 March 1925, and again, single-deck vehicles from Tilling-Stevens were used. The tramway had used double-deck trams, but there was an arched bridge on the route, with the tram tracks placed centrally in the road. Because trolleybuses were not constrained by tracks, double-deck vehicles would have collided with the bridge if they did not use the centre of the road. At the opening ceremony for the new route, the chairman of the Tramways Committee was able to report that the fortunes of the Wednesfield line had been turned around, and it was now a profitable route, whereas the tramway had made a loss. The Corporation rectified their lack of formal operating powers for the trolleybuses when they obtained the Wolverhampton Corporation Act (1925), which gave them powers to build and run trolleybus routes within the borough and outside it, as well as giving them powers to take over tram routes which were operated by the Wolverhampton District Electric Tramways Company. The tram routes served Dudley, Bilston and Willenhall, and the intention was to replace the trams with trolleybuses. The conversion work took place in stages, with the first part from Snow Hill to the Fighting Cocks public house on the borough boundary opening on 26 October 1925. This was extended to Sedgley Bull Ring on 10 November 1925, and then to Sedgley Depot on 11 May 1927. Shortly afterwards, the changeover was complete, when the service reached Dudley on 8 July 1927. The initial vehicle, which carried civic officials from Coseley, Dudley, Sedgley, Willenhall and Wolverhampton, was one of a batch of 3-axle double- deck trolleybuses manufactured by Guy Motors of Wolverhampton. They had produced their first such vehicle in 1926, which had 61 seats and a covered top but an open staircase at the rear. Wolverhampton ordered a further 58 similar vehicles from Guy Motors over the next five years, although they all had an enclosed rear staircase. Expansion of the network continued through 1927, with trolleybuses reaching Neachells Lane, Willenhall on 15 May. This route was extended to Willenhall Market Place on 16 September, as there were plans for through running onto the Walsall system. A route to Penn Fields opened on 11 July, and another to Tettenhall on 29 October. The last trams ran in August 1928, which allowed the route to Bilston to be opened on 19 November 1928, and this was extended on 28 May 1929 to reach Darlaston. It was at this point that the system became the largest in the world, with around of route, and the service being used by 36 million passengers a year. The tramcar route to Bradley was to have been converted, but motor buses replaced the trams instead. In 1930 a circular service to Whitmore Reans began operating, which included a branch specifically to serve the Courtauld's textile works. A new departure was the route from Willenhall to Fighting Cocks, which did not involve the trolleybuses starting at the town centre. In late 1931, through working with the Walsall system began, when the Willenhall line was extended, enabling Walsall trolleybuses to reach Wolverhampton and Wolverhampton trolleybuses to reach Walsall. The joint working began on 16 November 1931, after a low bridge on the Willenhall route was modified to allow the running of double-deck vehicles. The Corporation were now opening routes well beyond the confines of the old tramway system. Trolleybuses ran to Bushbury Hill from 30 November 1931, and to a number of developing residential areas subsequently. The Amos Lane and Pear Tree routes opened on 21 March 1932, and on 10 April 1933 a service began serving Brickkiln Street, Jeffcock Road and Bradmore. The Penn Fields route had been extended to Penn on 10 October 1932, and a second route to Penn opened on 8 April 1935. The Wednesfield route was extended to Lichfield Road on 10 February 1934, and trolleybuses replaced motor buses on Oxbarn Avenue the following day. By 1936 there were 90 double- deck and 18 single-deck vehicles in operation. Single-deck vehicles were used on the Fordhouses route until 1938, but those on the Wednesfield route continued until 1943, when the roadway beneath a railway bridge was lowered, allowing double-deck vehicles to be used throughout. The single-deck vehicles were then sold. The situation during and immediately after the Second World War appears a little confused. Joyce et. al. state that 38 extra vehicles were obtained to meet wartime traffic levels. Lockwood states that wartime needs were met by borrowing 12 Sunbeams from Bournemouth, and the purchase of 38 Sunbeams with utility bodywork between 1943 and 1946. The fleet list published in Joyce et. al. shows 18 Sunbeams entering service between 1940 and 1942, and 38 Sunbeams with utility bodywork arriving between 1943 and 1946, so the earlier reference to 38 vehicles appears to cover the utility vehicles, some of which did not enter service until the war was over. Between the end of the war and 1950, a further 50 Guys and 71 Sunbeams were obtained, enabling the replacement of many of the older vehicles in the fleet. Some of the earlier 2-axle Sunbeams were sold to Southend in 1950, with a further batch going to Belfast in 1952. =Demise= Wolverhampton Corporation began a process of fitting new bodies to the utility vehicles in 1952, when 16 vehicles were refurbished by Park Royal Vehicles. Charles H. Roe of Leeds built new bodies for a further 16 in 1958/59, and a final batch of 22 were rebodied in 1961/62. Although the future of the trolleybus system was considered in 1957, no action was taken at the time. On 22 January 1961, motor buses replaced the trolleybuses on the Penn Road routes, because major roadworks were under way at the in-town end of the service, and although some of the routes were reinstated on 21 May, that along Oxbarn Avenue was not, with motor buses continuing in service. In 1961 there were some 150 vehicles operational, but the Transport Committee decided that the trolleybuses should be withdrawn, and the routes were progressively closed. Those to Penn and Penn Fields were the first to go, on 9 June 1963, followed by the Tettenhall route on 30 June. Major closures took place on 3 November, when services to Finchfield and Low Hill, Merry Hill and Low Hill, Amos Lane and Jeffcock Road, and Wednesfield were all withdrawn. Next to go was the Fordhouses to Bushbury Hill service, on 26 January 1964, and on 26 October, the route from Willenhall to Bilston and Fighting Cocks ceased to operate. This was partly as a result of the rebuilding of a railway bridge at Willenhall. More closures followed in 1965, with services from Whitmore Reans to Bilston and Darlaston ending on 8 August, while the Willenhall service and the jointly-worked route between Walsall and Wolverhampton ceased on 31 October. Since Walsall had been extending their routes fairly recently, there were hopes that the joint service would last somewhat longer, but it was not to be. This left just the Dudley route, which continued until it closed without ceremony on 5 March 1967. The final working was by Sunbeam No. 446. =Depots= Initially, the trolleybuses were stabled in depots which were formerly used for tramcars. The main depot was on Cleveland Road, at the centre of the system, but it was not an ideal location, as it had no yard, and trolleybuses generally reversed out straight onto a main road. Following the acquisition of the Wolverhampton District Electric Tramways Company, two of their depots were used for the trolleybuses, one at Sedgley and the other at Bilston. On 6 October 1938 a new depot providing stabling for 56 trolleybuses was opened on Park Lane, Fallings Park, on the opposite side of the road to the Guy Motors works. From the Cleveland Road depot there were tracks to the Snow Hill terminus, for the route to Fighting Cocks, Sedgley and Dudley, and to the route out to Bilston, which provided access to all of the routes that radiated out from central Wolverhampton. These tracks were only used for vehicle movements, and there were no public services over them. Preservation Four Wolverhampton trolleybuses are known to have survived. No. 443, a Sunbeam W4 supplied with BTH electrical equipment and Park Royal utility bodywork in 1946, was one of the batch rebodied in 1958/59 by Roe. It remained in service until the system closed, and now operates at the Black Country Living Museum in Dudley. They also have No. 78, an early Guy BTX 3-axle vehicle. This was supplied in 1931 with Rees-Stevens electrical equipment, and was one of the first batch where Guy also built the bodywork, rather than Dodson building it. It was awaiting restoration in 2020. No. 616 was one of the final batch of Sunbeam F4 trolleybuses and was bought in 1949. It came with BTH electrical equipment, and bodywork by Park Royal, which was wide, following a change in legislation. It was withdrawn from service in 1963 or 1965, and was given to the Railway Preservation Society, then based at Hednesford, but was stored at Alton in Hampshire. In order to safeguard it, they donated it to the predecessor of The Transport Museum, Wythall, who in turn stored it in the north west of England until 2004, when it was moved to Wythall. Some bodywork repairs were carried out in 2006, and it was repainted in 2007. It is now on static display at the museum. The final vehicle is No. 654, the last vehicle numerically in the fleet at Wolverhampton, and one of the final batch of Guy BT vehicles, with BTH electrical equipment and Park Royal bodywork. It was withdrawn in 1965, and given to the National Trolleybus Association (NTA). It returned to the system for tours on the final day of operation, and then moved to a Ministry of Defence site, where it was severely vandalised in 1968. It was then moved to more secure storage in Ashton, Northamptonshire, and although the bodywork is in poor condition, it is structurally sound. The NTA is intending to return it to operational condition, once they have completed restoration of Belfast No. 168, which should be in late 2020 or early 2021. It was listed as preserved at Ashton, Northamptonshire in 2017. Trolleybus No. 274 existed until at least 2014 as part of a cottage at Coven. It was built in 1938, but was withdrawn from service in 1949, after it was involved in an accident. Mr S B Church, who lived near the Park Lane depot, bought it and took it to Coven, where it became a summer house. In 1968 the top deck was removed, and the lower deck was incorporated into a bungalow. The bungalow was auctioned in May 2014, but information on the subsequent fate of the lower deck has not been published.

The plot, set in Havana in 1956, near the end of Fulgencio Batista's dictatorship, follows a young girl whose aspirations to obtain a scholarship in America, against the odds, are paralleled with her reading of Ernest Hemingway's The Old Man and the Sea. The film was selected as the Cuban entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 64th Academy Awards, but was not designated a nominee.Margaret Herrick Library, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences  Plot  In 1956, sixteen-year-old Larita lives with her mother and her aunt's family in a ramshackle house outside Havana. From their garden they can see Ernest Hemingway's white mansion. At home, she adorns her walls with pictures of Elvis Presley and Tony Curtis, while at school she excels in her English class. Larita is delighted when her teacher suggests that she enter a competition for a scholarship to attend university in the United States. Larita also happily dates a classmate, Victor, who is trying to establish a student association. On a visit to a bookshop, she is given a copy of Hemingway's The Old Man and the Sea, which she starts to read avidly, drawing parallels between the novel and her own life which she records in her diary. At home, her family tease her about her academic aspirations. They resent the fact that while they work hard she studies and contributes nothing to their meager existence. The issue of finances becomes more acute when Larita is sent home from school because she is not wearing the correct school uniform. However, she passes the first round of scholarship exams and is invited to a reception for the finalists. She makes herself as presentable as possible with the help of her relatives' sewing skills and the support of her grandmother, who pawns her treasured earrings to purchase fabric. She tells Victor that she is on the short list for the scholarship, which makes him angry because she has kept it a secret from him and is preparing to go abroad and abandon him for a year. That night Larita returns home to find that her uncle has been fired from his job as a policeman, which has been the family's principal means of support. At the scholarship interview, her chances appear to be hampered by the fact that she is illegitimate and does not have the right social connections to provide her with letters of recommendation. In desperation, Larita decides to visit Hemingway to see if he will write a reference for her, but she discovers he is away in Africa. Larita bitterly blames her mother for the fact that she is disadvantaged by poverty and illegitimacy. When she stays home from school pretending to be sick, her favorite teacher, Dr. Martinez, visits her and offers encouragement. To Larita's complaints about her poverty she says: \\"You're not exactly living under a bridge.\\" Meanwhile, at school, the student protests climax, the student association tries to get students to boycott classes, and Victor is arrested. Later that year, Larita takes a job at a coffee bar. One evening near Easter the scholarship administrator walks by and recognizes her. They establish that they recognize one another, but nothing else is said except the simplest wish from the administrator that Larita enjoy the holiday.

Upon returning to Larissa Nikoulitzas saw the growing movement and tried to talk the rebels out of it. They insisted on Nikoulitzas becoming their leader, as he had a fort and a private army. Nikoulitzas declined, as his two sons were in Constantinople, fearing they would come in harm's way. The rebels however forced Nikoulitzas to take a leadership position and the revolt began.

Facts The liquidator of Parkes Garage (Swadlincote) Ltd sought a declaration that a floating charge on the company's property given by a debenture to a creditor, Mr Oswald Ling, was invalid. Parkes Garage Ltd, a garage proprietor and motor dealer, went insolvent in March 1927 (though this only transpired during litigation). On 15 June it executed a floating charge for a group of creditors (the trustee acting for the group was an accountant named Mr Oswald Ling). On 27 July the company sold part of the business and used that cash to pay off the group of creditors, with interest and a fee to Mr Ling. They endorsed a memorandum of discharge on the debenture. On 14 September, another creditor, Midland Bank, heard about these dealings and successfully petitioned for a winding up order. The liquidator alleged that under section 212 of the Companies (Consolidation) Act 1908 (now Insolvency Act 1986 section 245) the debenture for Ling was invalid because it was conferred more value than it was worth in the three months before insolvency. The County Court judge held that the payment of the debts to the group of creditors was invalid. Mr Ling appealed. Judgment Eve J held that it was not open to the judge to declare the debenture as a whole invalid, so that no debt would be repaid at all. He was only allowed to declare the charge invalid, because that is all that Companies (Consolidation) Act 1908, section 212 (now Insolvency Act 1986, section 245) affected. The charge could not be merged with the debt itself. Nevertheless, it might well be argued yet that the whole transaction was invalid as a fraudulent preference, but that was not done here.

In astronomy, a clock drive (also known as a field rotator) is a motor-controlled mechanism used to move an equatorial mounted telescope along one axis to keep the aim in exact sync with the apparent motion of the fixed stars on the celestial sphere.Definition Overview Clock drives work by rotating a telescope mount's polar axis, the axis parallel to the Earth's polar axis (also called the right ascension axis) in the opposite direction to the Earth's rotation one revolution every 23 hours and 56 minutes (called sidereal day), thereby canceling that motion.Turn left at Orion: a hundred night sky objects to see in a small telescope ...

The organization takes its name from Omi, a hamlet in the Hudson River Valley two and a half hours from New York City. Details Art Omi offers five distinct residency programs: the Art Omi: Artists Residency for visual artists for three weeks in July; the Art Omi: Writers Residency for writers of fiction and non-fiction, critics and translators for up to two months in spring and fall; Art Omi: Architecture, which invites mid-career architects to develop their work during a full two-week residency; Art Omi: Music Residency, which brings together musicians, composers and improvisers in early August; and Art Omi: Dance for dancers and choreographers in late summer. The programs encourage residents to collaborate and explore new avenues of expression and experiment with media and techniques not always available to them at home. Residents are provided with free room and board as well as a congenial place in which to work. Each year a limited number of fellowships are available to help artists with the costs of travel and art supplies. The residency welcomes talented applicants whether they are starting out, in mid-career or are already established. To date Art Omi has hosted over two-thousand residents from 110 different countries and the United States. Art Omi invites gallerists, critics, agents, publishers, curators and collectors to give talks and presentations. Their visits also benefit residents by providing them with exposure and access to the New York cultural scene. Omi regularly holds exhibitions, readings, concerts and dance performances to which the public is invited. In addition to the four residency programs, Art Omi is also home to the Sculpture & Architecture Park, Art Omi: Architecture and Art Omi: Education. The main compound is made up of three separate buildings with 18 guest rooms, three conference rooms, a library and communal spaces. Ledig House (named for the late German publisher H.M. Ledig-Rowohlt), a converted 1830 farmhouse, serves as Art Omi's home and central meeting place. The principal work space consists of a two-story converted barn and several satellite sheds. The latest addition to the Art Omi campus is the Charles B. Benenson Visitors Center & Gallery, which opened to the public in the summer of 2008. The Center presents exhibitions of art and sculpture and includes a gift shop and caf√©. The structure has been built using state-of- the-art 'green' technology. Omi's facilities are available for rental for corporate retreats from December through March, when residency programs are not in session. Art Omi Sculpture & Architecture Park (previously the Fields Sculpture Park), which is open to the public throughout the year, features over 70 permanent and temporary exhibitions. The Sculpture & Architecture Park occupies approximately 120 acres of Art Omi's campus. Art Omi raises money primarily from philanthropic and corporate foundations and individual donors. Its major fundraising event is a New York City benefit held each spring.

Early life He was born in Lambeth, London, the second son, by his second wife, of Charles Field, of the firm of J. C. & J. Field, candle manufacturers, etc. Educated at Denmark Hill grammar school and at Mr. Long's school at Stockwell (where he was a schoolfellow of Professor Odling), Field showed so strong a liking for chemistry that, on leaving school in 1843, he was placed in the laboratory of the Polytechnic Institution, then conducted by Dr. Ryan. On leaving the Polytechnic, Field entered into partnership with a chemist named Mitchell as an assayer and consulting chemist, but finding the need of further training spent some time as a student under Dr. Hoffmann in the Royal College of Chemistry in Oxford Street. Field was one of the original members of the Chemical Society of London, started in 1846, and he read his first paper to that society in the following year.Memoirs Chem. Soc. iii. 404‚Äì11 Work in Chile In 1848 he accepted the post of chemist to some copper smelting works at Coquimbo in Chile. Some account of his work there is contained in his papers in the ‚ÄòJournal of the Chemical Society‚Äô for 1850, 'On the Examination of some Slags from Copper-smelting Furnaces,‚Äô and 'On the Ashes of the Cactus- plant,‚Äô from which large quantities of carbonate of soda were obtained. In 1851 Field described a natural alloy of silver and copper, which had the appearance of nearly pure silver, and also discovered that a certain ore which occurred in large quantities near Coquimbo was in reality pure lapis lazuli, the first found in South America. In 1852 Field was appointed manager of his company's works at Caldera, a new port to the north of Coquimbo. Before assuming this position he visited England and married a sister of (Sir) Frederick Abel, returning to Caldera in 1853, of which he was now appointed vice consul. The post involved many responsibilities in a land subject to revolutions. During the Russian War, Field also acted as the representative of France in that district. In 1856 Field became chemist and sub-manager to the smelting works then established by Se√±or Urmeneta at Guayacan, which have since become one of the largest copper-smelting works in the world. In 1859 a revolution broke out in Chile. Field sent his wife and family to England, but himself remained and succeeded in preserving the establishment from injury. Return to England In September 1859 he finally quit Chile for England. Soon after his arrival in London he was appointed lecturer on chemistry to St. Mary's Hospital (1860), and in 1862 became professor of chemistry in the London Institution. In the same year he was appointed chemist to the aniline colour works of Simpson, Maule, & Nicholson, a post which he held till 1866, when he became a partner in the old firm of his family - Messrs. J. C. & J. Field - in which he remained and of which he was senior partner at the time of his death. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1863. Death In 1876 Field's health began to fail, and after a long illness he died on 3 April 1885. Writings Field wrote forty-three papers on scientific subjects for various periodicals, in addition to one written in conjunction with his brother-in-law, Sir F. A. Abel. Among them are: # 'On the Solvent Power exercised by Hyposulphite of Soda on many Salts insoluble in Water' ('Journ. Chem.

Fossils have been found from Malawi, Zambia, and Tanzania. Description \\"Njalila\\" has a distinctively short, compact skull. The snout is wide, but the back of the skull is narrower than those of other gorgonopsians. The skull table is slightly concave. Two grooves run along the top of the skull between the eyes and the nostrils. The tip of the snout is sharply pointed, with the nostrils positioned at the very front of the skull. The snout also has bulging septomaxillae beneath the nostrils, but the nasal bones above are very narrow. The temporal fossa, a hole in the skull behind the eye socket, is very large. The borders of fossae form long, thin arches of bone. As in other gorgonopsians, \\"Njalila\\" has large blade-like caniniform teeth. The incisor teeth, however, are smaller than those of related gorgonopsians. History The type species of \\"Njalila\\", N. nasuta, was originally assigned to Dixeya, which was named by German paleontologist Friedrich von Huene in 1950 from Tanzania, Malawi, and Zambia. The type species of Dixeya, D. quadrata, was reclassified as a species of Aelurognathus in 1970. Although a second species had been established before the revision, the genus name Dixeya was considered invalid because its type belonged to another genus. The other species of Dixeya, D. nasuta, was not considered synonymous with Aelurognathus. It was placed in the genus Arctognathus. Moreover, since only the holotype specimen of D. quadrata was assigned to Aelurognathus, other specimens of the species were considered to belong to Arctognathus'. However, \\"Dixeya\\" nasuta possesses many features not seen in other Arctognathus remains. The most notable feature of these specimens was the distinctive pointed snout. A second species, \\"N. insigna\\", is based on a skull previously referred to Scylacops capensis. \\"N. insigna\\" has thicker arches between its fossae, a posteriorly wide skull, and a slightly rounded snout profile. \\"\\"Njalila\\" was named after the Njalila, a tributary of the Rhuhu River in Tanzania.

In 1952, he joined Rediffusion and became a programme director; he was mainly responsible for film production. At the same time, he was also an amateur participant for the recording of radio dramas. Later, he decided to focus on radio drama because his heavy workload made him unable to participate in both film production and radio drama. He participated in the production of various radio dramas of different genres and earned the title of 'the King of Broadcasting'. Chung wanted to resign from Rediffusion and join the USIS, but Rediffusion objected to that. Finally, after discussions between the USIS and Rediffusion, the USIS allowed him to work for Rediffusion, the RTHK and Commercial Radio Hong Kong outside work time. In 1970, Chung joined the Hong Kong Civil Service as a programme officer at the RTHK. In the late 1980s, Hong Kong saw the huge influx of Vietnamese refugees. The Hongkongese government implemented the policy of 'Comprehensive Plan of Action' on 16 June 1988 and the RTHK started to broadcast the famous 'B·∫Øt ƒë·∫ßu t·ª´ nay' announcement. Chung was the broadcaster reading out the Cantonese part of the announcement. Chung retired in 1991. Yet, he continued to be a programme host in the RTHK. He became the first ethnic Chinese broadcaster to be awarded the MBE medal in 1992; in 1998, he was awarded The Life Time Achievement in Broadcasting Award by the RTHK for his contribution to broadcasting. In the morning of 27 November 2009, Chung fainted in Prince Edward Station of Hong Kong MTR. He was rushed to Kwong Wah Hospital and was certified dead in the same morning at 11:36. Before his death, he was a host for the RTHK's programmes targeted at elderly audience.

Eight hundred Aragonese horse, many of them Castilian exiles in service of the Crown of Aragon under Henry of Trast√°mara, had launched a cavalgada in Castilian territory when, near the Castilian town of √Ågreda, confronted and routed a Castilian force under Juan Fern√°ndez de Henestrosa set to guard the frontier. Numerous Castilian noblemen and knights were killed, including Henestrosa, while many other were captured.  Background  The War of the Two Peters broke in 1356 when a squadron of 9 Catalan galleys under Francesc de Perell√≥s sent by the king Peter IV of Argon to assist the House of Valois in their succession conflict with the House of Plantagenet, captured near Sanl√∫car de Barrameda two ships under the flag of the Republic of Genoa, at that time engaged in a war against the Republic of Venice and the Crown of Aragon. The king Peter I of Castile, who was present at Sanl√∫car during the event, feel offended and demanded Perell√≥s the free of the Genoese vessels. Perell√≥s refused Peter's demands and was therefore chased by Castilian warships till the Portuguese coast. Peter of Castile complained afterwards to the king Peter IV Aragon, but as he did not obtained the desired results, he declared war on the Crown of Aragon. He promptly began the operations besieging by sea the Valencian town of Guardamar, unsuccessfully, and launching some cavalgadas through the frontier. In 1359 the Castilian fleet raided the Valencian and Catalan coasts, not obtaining satisfying results but menacing the town of Alicante. Peter IV, seeing that his southern frontier was in danger, dispatched several horse companies led by Pere de X√®rica to defend the area around Orihuela, Crevillente and Elche, and also ordered all the fortresses to be provisioned with enough ammunitions and supplies.  Battle  Over the following months the action displaced to the Aragonese border with Castille. In September, Henry of Trast√°mara, pretender to the Castilian throne and half-broder and rival of Peter I, together with his younger brother Tello and several members of the Aragonese House of Luna, as Pedro, Juan Mart√≠nez and Fray Artal de Luna, launched a raid in Castilian territory invading the country near the town of Almaz√°n. This force consisting of about 800 horse, encountered a considerable larger Castilian company of 1,500 horse led by the uncle of Peter I, Juan Fern√°ndez de Henestrosa. Refusing to run for cover, Henry offered battle near √Ågreda. The fought which ensued was a brief affair and concluded with the routing of the Castilian force. Among those Castilians who were killed were found Juan Fern√°ndez de Henestrosa. Other signaled casualties were Gomez Su√°rez de Figueroa, Fernando Garc√≠a Duque, Pedro Berm√∫dez, Gonzalo S√°nchez de Ulloa and Juan Gonz√°lez de Bahabon. Many noblemen and knights as I√±igo L√≥pez de Orozco, Fernando Rodr√≠guez de Villalobos, Juan G√≥mez de Bahabon, Hurtado D√≠az de Mendoza and D√≠az S√°nchez de Porra, all of them Knights of the Band, were captured. Also the Castilian banner was taken when his bearer, Gonzalo S√°nchez de Ulloa, was killed.  Aftermath  Peter I was informed of the defeat of his armies at his arrival on Seville from the Valencian coast. The Aragonese armies won another victory shortly after at Tarazon, but a few months later, in the spring of 1360, Henry was defeated by Peter I himself at the so-called First Battle of N√°jera. On this occasion Henry was supported by 1,200 cavalry and 2,000 cavalry, while Peter had a much larger army of 5,000 cavalry and 10,000 infantry. Though Peter won the first day he decided to withdraw and Henry was able to continue offering battle. However, Castille took the initiative and focused the operations at the southern Valencian frontier. The town of Orihuela was subsequently raided by 800 Castilian and Moor cavalry, but a relief force of 250 horse led by Count Alfons of Ribagorza and Denia dispersed them and recovered the lost ground.

Although the credited screenwriters for the drama were Liverpool screenwriter Jimmy McGovern and Scottish novelist Irvine Welsh the drama was largely written by sacked dock workers and previous union members under the supervision of the two screenwriters. This unusual writing method was considered an experiment in 'democratic television' and was documented in a separate channel 4 documentary, Writing the Wrongs. Plot Production =Filming= When choosing locations for the film, the Transport and General Workers' Union refused to allow filming to take place within their premises, with former dockers being removed from the building at one point when actor Robert Carlyle came to offer support in a scripting session. =Writing= A group of genuine dockers held regular workshops with the production team.

Published in 1991, the novel traces the history of the titular violin, a fictitious creation of Antonio Stradivari, recounting its usage under multiple owners interspersed with what Hersey describes as \\"intermezzi\\", interludes of fact. Hersey's 25th novel, it was the last he released before his death. Overview As a novel following the history of an object, it is in the style of a popular 18th-century genre termed \\"novel of circulation\\". The novel covers the history of the violin Antonietta from its creation by Antonio Stradivari in 1699. Beginning with an overview of the creation of the violin, named in honor of Stradivari's second wife, the novel follows the violin through multiple owners, focusing on its influence of their work and those around them. Among the owners of the violin featured in the novel are Mozart, who possessed the violin in the late 18th century and composed a sonata for it; Pierre Baillot, who describes its impact on the composition of Berlioz; Pavel Federovsky, who played in trio with Stravinsky; Spenser, a modern businessman in Martha's Vineyard; and Hersey himself, who claimed to have purchased the violin with advance money for the novel itself. In each section, the writer adopts a writing style to mirror the personality and perspective of the owner. Critical reception The novel was critically well received. Publishers Weekly termed it a \\"delightful tour de force\\". While suggesting that it may not appeal to those who did not appreciate classical music, The Milwaukee Journal described the book as \\"original and vibrant\\", concluding that \\"the joint appeal of passion in music and irony in history is universal, and, I should think, irresistible.\\" Publishers Weekly opined that while even non-music fans might enjoy the novel, which \\"satisfies on several levels\\", \\"the music lover will be doubly enchanted by a virtuoso performance.\\" The Victoria Advocate summarized it as \\"a rare novel indeed, and for music lovers a gem of sparkling brilliance.\\" Similar stories It has been speculated that the novel was an influence on the 1998 Canadian film The Red Violin, which similarly traces the history of an evocative violin through multiple owners. The film's producers indicate that although they became aware of the similarities in story concept during the writing of the film, the writers were instructed not to read the book to avoid any unconscious influence.

County Road 61 County Road 61 is a county route, which runs from the intersection of Minnesota 61 Expressway and North Shore Scenic Drive in Two Harbors, Minnesota, and follows the North Shore Scenic Drive to Duluth on Saint Louis County Road 61, passing through the communities of Larsmont and Knife River in Lake County. County 61 is more commonly known and signed as North Shore Scenic Drive between Duluth and Two Harbors and is also known as Scenic 61. County 61 (between Duluth and Two Harbors) was commissioned as U.S. 61 in 1926, ready for use by 1929, and paved by 1940. Until the expressway between Duluth and Two Harbors was constructed inland in the 1960s, County 61 (then U.S. 61) had served as the principal route between Duluth and Two Harbors. Formerly known as U.S. 61, the state turned over management of the road to Saint Louis and Lake counties in the 1960s and the two counties then designated the route \\"County 61\\". The course for Grandma's Marathon follows this road route annually in June. The following is a list of county-maintained roads in Lake County, Minnesota, United States.

Background  Feng Hongduo was originally from Lianshui (Êº£Ê∞¥, in modern Huai'an, Jiangsu), and he served as an officer at Ganhua Circuit (ÊÑüÂåñ, headquartered in modern Xuzhou, Jiangsu), which Lianshui belonged to. Once, when Feng was accused of impropriety by circuit administrators, fellow officer Zhang Xiong, who was also from Lianshui, spoke on his behalf, and Zhang's doing so caused Ganhua's military governor (Jiedushi) Shi Pu to suspect both of them.New Book of Tang, vol. 190. In 886, knowing that Shi suspected them, Zhang and Feng gathered 300 men and left Ganhua with them, crossing the Yangtze River to attack Su Prefecture (ËòáÂ∑û, in modern Suzhou, Jiangsu), which then belonged to Zhenhai Circuit. They captured it, and Zhang claimed the title of prefect. Eventually, he was able to gather an army reaching the size of 50,000, with 1,000 ships, and called his army Tiancheng Army ().Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 256.  Service under Zhang Xiong  Zhang Xiong was eventually dislodged from Su Prefecture by Xu Yue () and roved down the Yangtze River to East China Sea and then back up the Yangtze; Feng followed him.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 257. Zhang eventually settled in at Shangyuan (‰∏äÂÖÉ, in modern Nanjing, Jiangsu), and was given the title of prefect of a new Sheng Prefecture, with its seat at Shangyuan, by then-reigning Emperor Zhaozong.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 258. After Zhang's death in 893, Feng succeeded him as the prefect of Sheng.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 259.  As ruler of Sheng Prefecture  It was said that Feng Hongduo, as the prefect of Sheng, was capable in riding and archery, and was also a good speaker, speaking as if he were a learned Confucian scholar. He also possessed the strongest fleet of the region, constructed from good, durable wood that he obtained from afar; the ships were massive and known as \\"tower ships\\" ().Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 263. He made peace with Yang Xingmi, who by that point had taken control of Huainan. However, at one point, he sent his follower Shang Gongnai () to Yang, demanding that Yang turn over control of Run Prefecture (ÊΩ§Â∑û, in modern Zhenjiang, Jiangsu) to him. When Yang refused, Shang made the comment to Yang, \\"Lord, you reject our demand, but can you withstand the tower ship fleet?\\" Still, it appeared that no major conflict between Yang and Feng resulted from this incident. In 902, Emperor Zhaozong, who was then under the controls of the eunuch Han Quanhui and the warlord Li Maozhen at Li Maozhen's Fengxiang Circuit (È≥≥Áøî, headquartered in modern Baoji, Shaanxi), which was then under siege by another major warlord, Zhu Quanzhong the military governor of Xuanwu Circuit (ÂÆ£Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan), sent the imperial emissary Li Yan to the southeastern circuits to encourage the warlords there to join under Yang's command and attack Zhu. As part of the edicts that Li Yan promulgated, Feng was given the title of military governor of Wuning (Ê≠¶ÂØß, i.e., Ganhua). Meanwhile, by this point, Feng had felt trapped between Yang and Yang's vassal, Tian Jun the military governor of Ningguo Circuit (ÂØßÂúã, headquartered in modern Xuancheng, Anhui), but as he felt that he could depend on his tower ship fleet, he did not join the Huainan power bloc. Tian decided to try to conquer Feng's territory, so he hired the shipbuilders who had previously built Feng's ships to build ships for him, despite those shipbuilders' objections that Tian's territory lacked the type of wood that Feng used and therefore resultant ships would not be as durable. (Tian's response to them was, \\"Just build them; all I need to do is to use them once.\\") Tian thus quickly had a fleet built, ready to engage Tian. Feng realized Tian's intentions, and his subordinates Feng Hui () and Yan Jian () suggested that he attack Tian first. He therefore activated his fleet and headed southwest on the Yangtze, claiming to be readying to attack Zhong Chuan the military governor of Zhennan Circuit (ÈéÆÂçó, headquartered in modern Nanchang, Jiangxi), but was instead intending to attack Tian. When Yang sent emissaries to try to stop him from attacking Tian, he refused to listen. However, when he engaged Tian's fleet at Geshan (ËëõÂ±±, in modern Xuancheng), Tian dealt him a major defeat. Having been defeated by Tian, Feng Hongduo gathered the remnants of his fleet and planned to head down the Yangtze to East China Sea. Yang was concerned that he might be able to rebuild his forces and become a threat later, and therefore sent messengers to assure him that if he submitted, he and his army would be well-treated. Feng's army wanted to accept the offer, and when Yang, unarmed, thereafter went to Dongtang (Êù±Â°ò, in modern Yangzhou) to meet Feng, Feng and his army was impressed, and therefore joined Yang's army at Huainan. Yang made him the deputy military governor of Huainan. He thereafter served Yang without failure.Spring and Autumn Annals of the Ten Kingdoms (ÂçÅÂúãÊò•Áßã), vol. 8.

An equatorial platform or equatorial table is an equatorial telescope mount in the form of a specially designed platform that allows any device sitting on it to track astronomical objects in the sky on an equatorial axis. They are used to give equatorial tracking to any device sitting on them, from small cameras up to entire observatory buildings. They are often used with altazimuth mounted telescopes, such as the common Dobsonian telescope type, to overcome that type of mount's inability to track the night sky. With careful polar alignment sub-arc second precision CCD imaging is entirely possible. Roeser Observatory, Luxembourg (MPC observatory code 163) have contributed hundreds of astrometric measurements of Near Earth Asteroids to the Minor Planet Center using a home-built 20\\" Dobsonian telescope on an Osypowski equatorial platform. Types Many types of equatorial platform have been used over the years. The mid-1960s saw the introduction of the Russian AFU-75 satellite-tracking camera which consisted of a 3 axis altitude-altitude-azimuth mountSoviet journal of optical technology: Volume 43, Optical Society of America, American Institute of Physics , page 119 mounted on a three-point equatorial platform. Two of the points were aligned on a polar axis while the third was a jackscrew actuator to drive the platform. This gave the mount a few minutes of equatorial tracking to allow stars in the field of view to be imaged as points for accurate measurement. The late 1970s saw the publication of Adrien Poncet's \\"Poncet Platform\\", a very simple design for amateur telescope makers that used a pivot point and an inclined plane that made a very low profile \\"table\\". This type of mount has been a popular retrofit for altazimuth mounted telescopes, such as the common Dobsonian telescope type, adding equatorial tracking for high magnification work and astrophotography. Since the Poncet Platform's simple bearing surfaces suffers from high mechanical loadings when used with heavy telescopes or at low geographic latitudes more sophisticated equatorial platform designs were invented in the 1980s. One was Alan Gee's design that uses a cylindrical bearing surface and a pivot making a mount similar in structure to a horseshoe mount that has been \\"cut flat\\". In 1988 Georges D'Autume proposed a more sophisticated design which used conical bearing surfaces all around to raise the height of the \\"virtual polar axis\\" to make the mount better balanced for heavier loads. Poncet-based platforms are usually designed to track for 1 hour (15¬∞ of tilt) since longer tracking exceeds their range of motion, and could cause the instrument on top to topple off. At the end of its drive limit, the mount has to be pivoted back to the east to reset the clock drive mechanism. Further reading * Amateur telescope making - Stephen F.

The purple ray florets surround black and yellow discs. The lanceolate leaves are opposite the flower heads.  History  The species was first collected in 1789 at Tixtla, Guerrero, by Sess√© and Moci√±o. It was formally described as Zinnia violacea by Cavanilles in 1791. Jacquin described it again in 1792 as Zinnia elegans, which was the name that Sess√© and Mo√ßi√±o had used in their manuscript of Plantae Novae Hispaniae, which was not published until 1890.Kirkbride, J. H. & J. H. Wiersma. (2007). Proposal to conserve the name Zinnia elegans against Z. violacea. Taxon 56(3):958-959. The genus was named by Carl von Linn√© after the German botanist Johann Gottfried Zinn, who described the species now known as Zinnia peruviana in 1757 as Rudbeckia foliis oppositis hirsutis ovato-acutis, calyce imbricatus, radii petalis pistillatis. Linn√© realised that it was not a Rudbeckia.  Habits  Flowering occurs between spring to fall.  Cultivation  The garden zinnia was bred via hybridisation from the wild form. Zinnias are popular garden plants with hundreds of cultivars in many flower colours, sizes and forms. There are giant forms with flower heads up to 6 in (15 cm) in diameter. Flower colours range from white and cream to pinks, reds, and purples, to green, yellow, apricot, orange, salmon, and bronze. Some are striped, speckled or bicoloured. There are \\"pom- pom\\" forms that resemble dahlias. Sizes range from dwarf varieties of less than 6 inches (15 cm) in height to 3 feet (90 cm) tall. The powdery mildew common to zinnias in humid climates is less common in recently developed varieties, which are resistant. Other cultivars include 'Magellan', 'Envy Double', 'Fireworks', 'Purple Prince', 'Blue Point Purple', 'Profusion Cherry', 'Profusion Orange', 'Star Gold', 'Star Orange', and several white- flowered types such as 'Crystal White', 'Purity', and 'Profusion White'. Mixed-colour seed selections are available. = Growth = Zinnias grow easily and prefer well-drained, loamy soil and full sun. They grow best in dry, warm, frost-free regions, and many kinds are drought-tolerant. Some may be grown indoors.

It is located west-southwest of Togiak, Alaska. The radar surveillance station was closed on 1 November 1983, and was re-designated as a Long Range Radar (LRR) site as part of the Alaska Radar System. Today, it remains active as part of the Alaska NORAD Region under the jurisdiction of the 611th Air Support Group, Elmendorf AFB, Alaska. History Cape Newenham AFS was a continental defence radar station constructed to provide the United States Air Force early warning of an attack by the Soviet Union on Alaska. A construction contract was awarded to Haddock Engineers, Ltd., on 13 June 1950. Work was started on 12 September, and considerable construction difficulties. The only means of getting construction materials and supplies to the site was by barge or Navy LSTs, however this was restricted to when the sea was not frozen and had to be unloaded north from the proposed site . Initially, there were no roads, which had to be built as part of the construction effort. The site became operational in April 1954, two years behind schedule. Cape Newenham was initially maintained by Detachment F-5, 531st Aircraft Control and Warning Group (AC&W; Gp). In 1952, Alaskan Air Command (AAC) decided to upgrade the detachments to squadrons. The 794th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron (AC&W; Sq) was activated on 8 December 1952 with 107 military personnel authorized. However, due to delays in construction, the squadron operated at limited manning until the site became operational. The station had its main camp in a valley between peaks. Recreational features included hobby shops and recreation rooms, plus opportunities for such sports as skiing, skating, horseshoes, and basketball. The buildings were connected by enclosed portals so no one needed to go outside in winter unless absolutely necessary. Tours at the station were limited to one year because of the psychological strain and physical hardships. Mail was usually delivered twice a week. The station had a tramway connecting the base station with the radar antennas located on a mountain peak at 2,300 feet. The tramway cables were constantly breaking because of high winds and ice, and fog and the extreme cold made repairs hazardous. Ice 16 inches thick built up on the cables in winter. A new riblet type tramway was installed in 1962. Cape Newenham AFS was originally equipped with an AN/FPS-3 Search Radar which was later modified as the AN/FPS-93A Search Radar. The station provided information 24/7 to the air defense Direction Center at King Salmon AFS where it was analyzed to determine range, direction altitude speed and whether or not aircraft were friendly or hostile. An AN/FYQ-9 Semiautomatic Data Processing and Display System was installed and became operational in July 1965, eliminating the need to pass track data manually. Cape Newenham AFS was resupplied annually since 1950 by sealift. Bulk cargo was delivered across the beach in landing craft, while fuel was pumped ashore to storage tanks. It was part of the annual Cool Barge remote resupply operations originally known as Mona Lisa. The name was changed to Cool Barge in 1967. A runway was built in 1952 , north-northeast to facilitate the transportation of personnel and critical cargo. The squadron was assigned to various headquarters, including AAC. On 15 October 1977, the squadron was reassigned from Headquarters, AAC to the 531st AC&W; Gp upon the reactivation of the latter. The Group was redesignated the 11th Tactical Control Group on 1 July 1981. Communications were initially provided by a high frequency radio system which proved unreliable because of atmospheric disturbances. The Alaskan Air Command, after investigating various options, decided to build the White Alice Communications System, a system of Air Force-owned tropospheric scatter and microwave radio relay sites operated by the Air Force Communications Service (AFCS). The Cape Newenham site was activated in December 1957. It was inactivated in March 1979, and replaced by an Alascom owned and operated satellite earth terminal as part of an Air Force plan to divest itself of the obsolete White Alice Communications System and transfer the responsibility to a commercial firm. Construction of a composite building was begun in late 1975. The $11.7 million facility was accepted by the Alaska District Corps of Engineers in October 1980. However, occupancy was delayed until July 1981 because of safety deficiencies and changes in design. On 1 October 1977, AAC, after a trial period, implemented a site support contract with RCA Services as part of an Air Force-wide effort to reduce remote tours. Eighty military positions were deleted. The remaining 14 were primarily in operations. Over the years, the equipment at the station was upgraded or modified to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the information gathered by the radars. In 1983, Cape Newenham received a new AN/FPS-117 minimally attended radar under Alaskan Air Command's SEEK IGLOO program. It was designed to transmit aircraft tracking data via satellite to the Alaskan NORAD Regional Operations Control Center (ROCC) at Elmendorf AFB. No longer needed, the 794th AC&W; Sq was inactivated on 1 November 1983 and the station redesignated as a Long Range Radar (LRR) Site. This left only contractor personnel to maintain the site radar. The composite building was modified to house personnel and equipment, and the other facilities were disposed of. In 1990, jurisdiction of the Cape Newenham LRR Site was transferred to Eleventh Air Force with the re- designation of AAC. In 1998 Pacific Air Forces initiated \\"Operation Clean Sweep\\", in which abandoned Cold War stations in Alaska were remediated and the land restored to its previous state. After years of neglect the facilities at the station had lost any value they had when the site was closed. The site remediation of the radar, support and White Alice communication station was carried out by the 611th Civil Engineering Squadron at Elmendorf AFB, and remediation work was completed by 2005. Demographics Cape Newenham (Station) appeared once, on the 1980https://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/1980a_akABCD-01.pdf U.S. Census, as a census-designated place (CDP), just prior to its closure. It has not appeared on the census since. Current status Today very little of the former Cape Newenham Air Force Station remains. It is controlled by the Pacific Air Forces 611th Air Support Group, based at Elmendorf AFB. The site is generally unattended; a few civilian contractor maintenance personnel needed for continued operation access the site by the Cape Newenham LRRS Airport when needed to maintain the radar system. Climate Cape Newenham has the typical subarctic climate of most of Alaska, though owing to the maritime influence of the Bering Sea it borders on a polar climate despite receiving an amount of precipitation one would expect more of an oceanic location.

Shortly after his arrival in Edmonton, Taylor established the first telegraph, telephone, and electricity systems. Taylor asked the Bell Telephone Company to provide services in 1883. Alex Taylor, Dominion Telegraph Agent, brought the first two telephones made of Spanish mahogany, and asked store owner Henry William McKenney of St. Albert to keep the device in St. Albert. Taylor, who, at the time was working for the Dominion Telegraph and Signal Service proposed running a telephone line from his office to St. Albert, Alberta. January 3, 1885, the two tested the line, the first successful call in Northern Alberta. He founded Edmonton's first telephone company and made Edmonton's first telephone call. In 1892, Taylor installed a switchboard and Jennie Lauder became Edmonton's first telephone operator overseeing a system of 14 telephones. In 1893, the Edmonton District Telephone Company was granted a charter and less than a decade later it was operational 24 hours a day and provided service to nearby rural areas.

It holds that a floating charge can harden (or crystallise) when it secures a debt in an overdraft account, when the bank keeps the facility open as a company takes money out and puts money in. Facts The liquidator of Yeovil Glove Co Ltd, a glove manufacturer in Yeovil, sued National Provincial Bank to rescind a floating charge taken within 12 months before insolvency. The bank's floating charge was to secure Yeovil Glove's overdraft, which (on top of debts of ¬£94,000 to other unsecured creditors) had grown to ¬£67,000 when the bank took fixed security and then as money was still unpaid, a floating charge. Over the next year, Yeovil Glove paid ¬£111,000 and drew out (through cheques written to other people that the bank was honouring) ¬£110,000. At the time the Insolvency Act 1986, section 245 (formerly Companies Act 1948, section 322) read that a floating charge was voidable ‚Äòexcept to the amount of any cash paid to the company at the time of or subsequently to the creation of, and in consideration for, the charge.‚Äô The bank argued that because more money had been paid out of the account than was covered by the charge (albeit that new debts were run up) the charge was not voidable. As in Clayton's case, money going into an account is presumed to discharge the last debt first. So money had been advanced to the company to a greater extent than the charge, and the turnover of money converted the old value given into new value. Plowman J held that the ability to make drawings after was good consideration for the charge.

Plot \\"Deadlegs\\" Flint, an embittered paraplegic living in the Congo, controls local natives by dispensing to them small quantities of sugar and liquor (sometimes substituting the latter with kerosene). He also astonishes and frightens the natives by performing staged magic tricks, which create the illusion that he has supernatural powers. Assisting him with those tricks are his fianc√© Tula, two thugs‚ÄîHogan and Cookie‚Äîand a loyal native, Fuzzy. Flint has spent the last 18 years plotting revenge against Gregg, a man who had crushed his spine in a fight before he ran away with Flint's wife. The crippled man since then has built an \\"80-mile circle\\" around his jungle compound, an area patroled by his henchmen and where no one can enter or leave without Flint's consent. As part of his revenge plan, he also arranged years ago to have the infant daughter of Gregg and his former wife raised by nuns to be \\"clean in body and mind\\" within the safety and seclusion of a convent in Cape Town. Flint sends his man Hogan there to bring the daughter, Ann, to him. In Cape Town, Hogan disguises himself as a missionary and convinces Ann, now a young woman, to go with him to see her father Gregg. By the time Ann arrives at Flint's compound, she has become a hardened alcoholic after being confined for months in a brothel in Zanzibar and forced to work as a prostitute. She continues to be held captive at the Kongo camp and does Flint's bidding for the daily servings of brandy he allows her to have. Each day too he takes sadistic delight in degrading and physically abusing the daughter of his archenemy. Later, a cynical, drug- addicted doctor named Kingsland arrives, and soon he and Ann fall in love. Flint needs Kingsland to be sober to operate on him to relieve the constant pain caused by his paralysis. To hasten his sobriety, Flint has the doctor bound with ropes, taken to the nearby swamp, and placed up to his neck in the leech-infested water so the parasites can suck the drugs or \\"poisons\\" out of his system. Flint also tolerates Ann's relationship with Kingsland because of its purifying effect on the doctor; nevertheless, he continues to ridicule her. After Kingsland operates on Flint, Gregg arrives at the camp, summoned by Flint, who has stolen shipments of ivory from him. Flint hopes to have the ultimate revenge against Gregg by showing him his degraded daughter, having him killed, and then having Ann sacrificed as part of the natives' funeral ritual. Flint taunts Gregg until Gregg finally recognizes him as the person he once knew as Rutledge. The crippled man reminds him about running away with his wife after kicking Flint in the back and causing his paralysis. Flint then reveals how he has abused Gregg's daughter as part of his revenge plot, but Gregg proves that Ann is actually Flint's own daughter. Flint is stunned. After this revelation, Flint begs Gregg not to leave the compound or he will be killed by Fuzzy, who is patrolling the surrounding jungle and under orders to shoot Gregg if he sees him. Gregg ignores his old enemy's warning, departs, and Fuzzy kills him. Now desperate to save Ann from the natives' sacrificial fire, Flint has Fuzzy guide her, Kingsland, Tula, and Cookie through an escape tunnel to the swamp. Flint remains behind and dies trying to keep angry natives at bay. Just before he is killed, he desperately prays that Ann will get away safely with Kingsland. Some time later, Flint's pet chimpanzee is shown finding the crippled man's necklace within the ashes of a pyre. Meanwhile, Ann and Kingsland are aboard a riverboat sailing downriver. As the couple waits to be married by the boat's captain, the film ends with Kingsland describing to her their destination, his small home in Sicily.

Reception Many film critics and movie-industry publications in 1932 objected to what they viewed as the gruesome, salacious content of Kongo. In its distribution to various locations, especially in metropolitan areas like New York City, the film was often consigned to lesser theaters or \\"houses\\" and used as a filler on theater schedules until more highly anticipated or \\"prestigious\\" productions arrived.Green, Abel (1932). \\"Kongo\\", review, Variety (New York, N.Y.), November 22, 1932, page 16.

In his overall assessment of Kongo for Variety, reviewer Abel Green describes the picture as essentially a tedious remake and a waste of good acting talent: Another widely read trade paper at the time, The Film Daily, agreed with Green's general assessment of Kongo, describing it as a \\"far-fetched tropical melodrama\\" with a \\"disagreeable theme\\", one replete with \\"squalor\\" and \\"high-tension hokum that makes the affair hard to believe\\".\\"Kongo\\", review, The Film Daily (New York, N.Y.), November 17, 1932, page 7.

The review of Kongo in the December 1932 edition of Photoplay provides some additional insight into reactions by fan-based publications. Among the nation's oldest movie magazines, the Chicago monthly also found Kongo a misuse of its cast's abilities and an inferior remake of West of Zanzibar. The magazine in its review also advises adult theatergoers to keep their children away from the film: Many theater owners in 1932, known then as \\"exhibitors\\" in the film industry, cautioned fellow exhibitors about screening Kongo.

G. Wodehouse, music by Victor Herbert, Jerome Kern and others, and lyrics by Harry B. Smith, Otto Harbach, Henry Blossom and others. Made up of a string of vignettes, the show features songs from such musicals as The Wizard of Oz, Three Twins, Babes in Toyland, Ziegfeld Follies and The Belle of New York.  Background In 1916, Charles Dillingham and Florenz Ziegfeld produced The Century Girl, with music by Irving Berlin. Despite mildly positive reviews, the show closed without recouping its investment. On their next production, which was to be called Miss 1917, they hired Jerome Kern and Victor Herbert to compose the score and Guy Bolton and P.G. Wodehouse to collaborate on the book. Kern and Bolton had collaborated on the Princess Theatre musicals, including Very Good Eddie (1915). British humorist and playwright Wodehouse then joined them for several innovative musicals there, including Oh, Boy! (1917).Kenrick, John. \\"History of The Musical Stage 1910‚Äì1919: Part I\\", Musicals 101.com: The Cyber Encyclopedia of Musical Theatre, TV and Film, accessed 27 May 2008 = Involvement of George Gershwin = The show is mostly known today as George Gershwin's introduction to musical theatre. During rehearsals for Miss 1917, Gershwin conducted the pit orchestra and played the piano. He was hired in October 1917, being paid $35 each week. As the rehearsal period extended, Gershwin earned more money. He would later record Kern's \\"The Land Where the Good Songs Go\\", which was used in the revue, as a piano roll in January 1918. While working for the show, Gershwin and his brother Ira Gershwin befriended Herbert and Kern, keeping \\"in contact with some of the major figures on Broadway\\". Sunday night concerts held in New York City by the show's cast introduced Gershwin's \\"There's More to a Kiss Than the Sound\\" and \\"You-oo, Just You\\", both with lyrics by Irving Caesar. \\"Gershwin had begun work on Broadway as a rehearsal pianist for the Jerome Kern and Victor Herbert musical Miss 1917. Within months, his talent as a composer was noticed by everyone in the show and he was quickly put under contract by Harms Music. His involvement with Miss 1917 brought him to the attention of music producer Harry Askins, who in turn mentioned him to Max Dreyfus, \\"one of the giants of music publishing\\".  1917 Broadway production  The producers of the show \\"had demanded extremely elaborate staging for the revue\\", so no out-of-town tryouts were held, and the show premiered directly on Broadway on 5 November 1917, at the Century Theatre. The production was staged, directed and supervised by Ned Wayburn, with choreography by Adolph Bohm. The creative team also included set designer Joseph Urban, who built a rotating thrust stage for the theatre. Costume design was attributed to eight designers, including Paul Chaflin, Willy Pogany, and Max Weldy. The original cast starred comedian Lew Fields, Andrew Tombes and Vivienne Segal. it also included George White, Ann Pennington, Charles King, Bessie McCoy Davis, Bert Savoy, Irene Castle, Marion Davies, Lilyan Tashman and the comedic team Van and Schenck. Kern originally wanted Segal to sing \\"They Didn't Believe Me\\" in the revue, though Dillingham and Herbert preferred her to sing \\"Kiss Me Again\\". Segal's siding with the latter caused tension among the creative team. According to a member of the production crew, technical rehearsals were interrupted several times due to disagreements in staging and choreography; at one point, Kern sought to close the show early, though Ziegfeld wouldn't have it. The show got rave reviews.Golden, Eve. Chapter Thirty-One, \\"Vernon and Irene Castle's Ragtime Revolution\\", p. 191, University Press of Kentucky, 2007 Although Castle was singled out for praise by reviewers, she was unhappy performing on stage without her husband and usual dance partner Vernon Castle: \\"I found myself hopelessly lost as a solo number. I had no training for dancing alone and I should never have tried it.\\" Though successful with critics, the revue failed to attract an audience; at least not enough of one to pay for the lavish production. Castle, White and others were let go by the producers, but the show still foundered in its out-of-the-way theatre. It closed on 5 January 1918, after only six weeks of performances. = Subsequent events = A month after Miss 1917 closed on Broadway, on 21 February 1918, items used in the show were sold in an auction, raising $11,300, according to The New York Times. Most of the items for auction were bought by J. J. Shubert. The following day, Sam Harrison of the New Amsterdam Theatre bought the performing rights to the musical. A London transfer, planned for March 1920, as well as a US national tour were cancelled. According to The New York Times, the creative team would not allow Ziegfeld to stage the show internationally due to planned major staging and plot changes that he hoped would make the humour more accessible to international audiences.

Since 1994, the Temple of Confucius has been part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site \\"Temple and Cemetery of Confucius and the Kong Family Mansion in Qufu\\". The two other parts of the site are the nearby Kong Family Mansion, where the main-line descendants of Confucius lived, and the Cemetery of Confucius a few kilometers to the north, where Confucius and many of his descendants have been buried. Those three sites are collectively known in Qufu as San Kong (), i.e. \\"The Three Confucian [sites]\\". History Historical plan of the Temple of Confucius (1912) Within two years after the death of Confucius, his former house in Qufu was already consecrated as a temple by the Duke of Lu. In 205 BC, Emperor Gao of the Han Dynasty was the first emperor to offer sacrifices to the memory of Confucius in Qufu. He set an example for many emperors and high officials to follow. Later, emperors would visit Qufu after their enthronement or on important occasions such as a successful war. In total, 12 different emperors paid 20 personal visits to Qufu to worship Confucius. About 100 others sent their deputies for 196 official visits. The original three-room house of Confucius was removed from the temple complex during a rebuilding undertaken in 611 AD. In 1012 and in 1094, during the Song Dynasty, the temple was extended into a design with three sections and four courtyards, around which eventually more than 400 rooms were arranged. Fire and vandalism destroyed the temple in 1214, during the Jin Dynasty. It was restored to its former extent by the year 1302 during the Yuan Dynasty. Shortly thereafter, in 1331, the temple was framed in an enclosure wall modelled on the Imperial palace. After another devastation by fire in 1499, the temple was finally restored to its present scale. In 1724, yet another fire largely destroyed the main hall and the sculptures it contained. The subsequent restoration was completed in 1730. Many of the replacement sculptures were damaged and destroyed during the Cultural Revolution in 1966. In total, the Temple of Confucius has undergone 15 major renovations, 31 large repairs, and numerous small building measures. Another main Confucius Temple was built in Quzhou by the southern branch of the Confucius family. Description Plan of the Temple of Confucius The temple complex is among the largest in China, it covers an area of 16,000 square metres and has a total of 460 rooms. Because the last major redesign following the fire in 1499 took place shortly after the building of the Forbidden City in the Ming Dynasty, the architecture of the Temple of Confucius resembles that of the Forbidden City in many ways. The main part of the temple consists of nine courtyards arranged on a central axis, which is oriented in the north‚Äìsouth direction and is 1.3 km in length. The first three courtyards have small gates and are planted with tall pine trees, they serve an introductory function. The first (southernmost) gate is named \\"Lingxing Gate\\" () after a star in the Great Bear constellation, the name suggests that Confucius is a star from heaven. The buildings in the remaining courtyards form the heart of the complex. They are impressive structures with yellow roof-tiles (otherwise reserved for the emperor) and red-painted walls, they are surrounded by dark- green pine trees to create a color contrast with complementary colors. Lingxing Gate The main structures of the temple are: * Lingxing Gate () * Shengshi Gate () * Hongdao Gate () * Dazhong Gate () * Thirteen Stele Pavilions () * Dacheng Gate () * Kuiwen Hall (Â•éÊñáÈñ£, built in 1018, restored in 1504 during the Ming Dynasty and in 1985) * Xing Tan Pavilion (ÊùèÂ£á, Apricot Platform) * De Mu Tian Di Arch * Liangwu () * Dacheng Hall (Â§ßÊàêÊÆø, built in the Qing Dynasty) * Resting Hall (ÂØ¢ÊÆø, dedicated to Confucius' Wife) =Dacheng Hall= The Dacheng Hall (), whose name is usually translated as the Hall of Great Perfection or the Hall of Great Achievement, is the architectural center of the present-day complex. The hall covers an area of 54 by 34 m and stands slightly less than 32 m tall. It is supported by 28 richly decorated pillars, each 6 m high and 0.8 m in diameter and carved in one piece out of local rock. The 10 columns on the front side of the hall are decorated with coiled dragons. It is said that these columns were covered during visits by the emperor in order not to arouse his envy. Dacheng Hall served as the principal place for offering sacrifices to the memory of Confucius. It is also said to be one of the most beautiful views of Confucius Temple.

It commemorates Confucius teaching his students under an apricot tree. Each year at Qufu and at many other Confucian temples a ceremony is held on September 28 to commemorate Confucius' birthday. =Stele pavilions= A large number of stone stelae are located on the premises of the Temple of Confucius. A recent book on Confucian stelae in Qufu catalogs around 500 such monuments on the temple's grounds,Luo Chenglie (2001), list on pp. 1110-1128 noting that the list is far from complete.Luo Chenglie (2001), p. 1 (Compiler's preface) The steles commemorate repeated rebuildings and renovations of the temple complex, contain texts extolling Confucius and imperial edicts granting him new honorary titles. While most of these tablets were originally associated with the Temple of Confucius, some have been moved to the temple's grounds for safekeeping from other sites in Qufu in modern times.E.g., some stelae found in Jiuxian village, which was the site of the Qufu county seat during the Song, Jin, and Yuan Dynasties. The inscriptions on the stelae are mostly in Chinese, but some of the Yuan Dynasty and Qing Dynasty stelae also have texts, respectively, in Middle Mongolian (using the 'Pags-Pa script) and Manchu. Some of the most important imperial stelae are concentrated in the area known as the \\"Thirteen Stele Pavilions\\" (ÂçÅ‰∏âÁ¢ë‰∫≠, Shisan Bei Ting). These 13 pavilions are arranged in two rows in the narrow courtyard between the Pavilion of the Star of Literature (Kuiwen Ge) in the south and the Gates of Great Perfection (Dacheng Men) in the north. The northern row consists of five pavilions, each of which houses one large stele carried by a giant stone tortoise (bixi) and crowned with dragons; they were installed during the Kangxi, Yongzheng and Qianlong eras of the Qing Dynasty (between Kangxi 22 and Qianlong 13, i.e. A.D. 1683-1748). These imperial stelae stand 3.8 to 4 m tall, their turtles being up to 4.8 m long. They weigh up to 65 tons (including the stele, the bixi turtle, and the plinth under it).The list of stelae in this row in Luo Chenglie (2001), p. 1119, and the individual entries for the five stelae listed there. The weight information, page 10 (end note 1) in the Compiler's preface. The southern row consists of eight pavilions, housing smaller steles, several in each. Four of them house stelae from the Jurchen Jin Dynasty (1115-1234) and the Mongol Yuan Dynasty; the others, from the Qing Dynasty.The list of stelae in these pavilions in Luo Chenglie (2001), p. 1119-1122, and the individual entries for the five stelae listed there. A large number of smaller tablets of various eras, without bixi pedestals, are lined in the open air in \\"annexes\\" around the four corners of the Thirteen Stele Pavilions area.The list of stelae in these four areas in Luo Chenglie (2001), p. 1122-1126. Four important tortoise-borne imperial stelae from the Ming Dynasty can be found in the courtyard south of the Star of Literature Pavilion. This area has two stele pavilions. The eastern pavilion houses a stele from Year 4 of the Hongwu era (1371), designating deities associated with geographical directions etc. The western pavilion contains a stele from Year 15 of the Yongle era (1417), commemorating a renovation of the temple. The other two stelae are in the open air: a Year 4 of the Chenghua era (1468) stele in front of the eastern pavilion, and Year 17 of the Hongzhi era (1504) stele in front of the western pavilion, also commemorating temple repair projects. Dozens more of smaller, turtle-less stelae are located in this area as well.The list of stelae in these four areas in Luo Chenglie (2001), p. 1110-1114.

Facts The liquidator of Shoe Lace Ltd sought a declaration that a debenture given to Sharp Investments Ltd, which owned 80 per cent of Shoe Lace and was part of a group controlled by the alleged shadow director Mr Mahtani who lived in Ratingen, was invalid under the Insolvency Act 1986 section 245 because it was created after payments to the company. Shoe Lace had shoe shops in Lancashire and Yorkshire but was hopelessly insolvent by April 1990. It gave a debenture to Sharp Investments Ltd secured with a floating charge over the whole undertaking on 24 July. Sharp gave it ¬£300,000 on 3 April, ¬£50,000 in May and ¬£11,500 in July. The Insolvency Act 1986 section 245(2)(a) states that a floating charge is voidable if the value given for the charge does not come after or ‚Äòat the same time‚Äô as the charge created. It was questioned what the precise time limit of this was. Judgment Hoffmann J held that the debenture was voidable, because no businessman would hold this to have been at the same time. Ralph Gibson LJ, Nolan LJ and Sir Christopher Slade upheld Hoffmann J that a delay of any substantial length (more than a coffee break) would be fatal to the exception.

Indeed, there are several tunnels running through the cliffs below the castle. Access to the castle is by means of a brick bridge over the defensive ditch. History The first mention of Hollenfels was in 1129 when Ludolf, Lord of Hollenfels, was given the water rights of the abbey of Marienthal which lies just 400 metres away. The majestic tower, 39 metres tall, with its sumptious Gothic rooms reached by means of a spiral staircase was built in 1380.\\"Les Ch√¢teaux de la Vall√©e de l'Eisch\\" , P&T; Luxembourg.

The rooms have impressive fireplaces, windows set back in the sturdy walls and a number of sculptures. Until 1477, the castle belonged to the lords of Hollenfeld and Elter. It then successively became the property of Raville of Ansembourg, Greiffenklau, Raugraves of Salm, von Thinner, von Hohenstein and Brouckhoven-Hohenstein. In the 1680s, the castle was captured by the French, taken back by the Spaniards and finally recaptured by the French. The mansion on the north-eastern side of the keep was added in 1729 and was restyled with a Baroque finish in 1921. In 1929, when the castle was falling into ruin, restoration work was carried out by the Luxembourg architect J. Schoenberg. Between 1945 and 1948, the castle was used as a camp for prisoners of war.

Early life Bedell was born in Hudson, New York in 1817, the son of Rev. Gregory Townsend Bedell of Staten Island and his wife, Penelope Thurston Bedell.Dwight, 711 While an infant, Bedell's family moved to Fayetteville, North Carolina.Magazine of Western History, 405 In 1822, they moved again to Philadelphia where his father became the rector of St. Andrew's Episcopal Church. Bedell was given a thorough preparation for college in Dr. Muhlenberg's increasingly admired school in Queen's County, New York. After gaining the diploma from the Institute at Flushing, Bedell attended Bristol College, an Episcopal institution not destined for a long life. He graduated in 1836 and headed to Alexandria to be prepared for ordination at the Virginia Theological Seminary, graduating in 1840.Perry, 143 Bedell was ordained deacon that same year by his great-uncle, Bishop Richard Channing Moore, and was ordained priest by the same bishop in 1841.Batterson, 192 After his ordination to the priesthood, he served as rector of Church of the Holy Trinity in West Chester, Pennsylvania. Two years later, Bedell moved to Church of the Ascension in New York City, where he remained until his elevation to the episcopate. While there, Bedell earned a doctorate of divinity from Norwich University. In 1845, Bedell married Julia Strong. They had three children, all of whom died in infancy. Bishop of Ohio Bedell was consecrated assistant Bishop of Ohio in 1859. He was the 67th bishop in the ECUSA, and was consecrated in St. Paul's Church, Richmond, Virginia by Bishops William Meade, Charles Pettit McIlvaine, and John Johns, along with other co- consecrators.Batterson, 193 He served as assistant bishop for fourteen years and, during the American Civil War, preached loyalty to the Union. When Bishop McIlvaine died in 1873, Bedell succeeded him as the third Bishop of Ohio. In 1875, the diocese was divided into northern and southern parts, and Bedell remained bishop of the northern part, which retained the name \\"Ohio\\".Appelton's, v.1, 215 Theologically, Bedell leaned toward the evangelical side of the Episcopal Church, in contrast to the growing Tractarian movement. That one coming out of Muhlenberg's Church Institute at Flushing (and from 1836, College Point NY) sympathized more with the evangelical element of Anglican Christianity should not surprise us; for Muhlenberg called himself an \\"Evangelical Catholic\\" Christian. The first half of the term connoted the spontaneous, Spirit-driven aspect of the Faith; the latter stood for order, structure, and the orthodox dogmas of the historic Catholic Church of the Creed. While many of the Flushing and College Point alumni identified with the High Church and (later) Anglo-Catholic wings of the PECUSA, many did not. Bedell resigned his episcopal duties in 1889, owing to physical infirmity, and died in 1892.

Contents In Secrets of the Lamp, Zakhara's multitudes of djinn, jann, dao, efreeti, and the rest are for player characters to command. Its centerpiece is a detailed description of the famous genie City of Brass. This city, which floats on an endless lake of burning oil, is featured in a poster map and on story cards and monster sheets. A lengthy scenario in the 32-page adventure booklet sends the PCs (levels 4-7) all over the City of Brass. An efreeti physician falls instantly in love with one of the heroes. The physician imprisons the party, and soon they run into trouble with his two current wives, his albino nightmare, patrolling salamanders, and the Sultan of the Efreet. The 64-page \\"Genie Lore\\" book describes the Sevenfold Mazework of the Great Dismal Delve, the Court of Ice and Steel, the Great Padishah of the Marid, genie sorcerers, new magic, and the details of genie wishes. Publication history Secrets of the Lamp was written by Wolfgang Baur, and published by TSR in 1993. Reception Allen Varney reviewed Secrets of the Lamp for Dragon magazine #219 (July 1995). He called the sourcebox itself \\"entertaining\\" and the poster map of the City of Brass \\"nice\\". He noted that with the efreet in the adventure scenario falling in love with one of the heroes, that \\"this kind of thing happens all the time in the Al-Qadim line\\". He comments further on the adventure: \\"It's all rambunctious excitement and daring exploits, enhanced by fanatic efreet warriors, sparktail scorpions, and the bumbling djinni Hazim the Fool. However, the DM should take care to keep things on track, because if the PCs fail, they end up slaves for seven years.\\" Of the \\"Genie Lore\\" book, Varney comments that \\"Baur hints at many colorful story possibilities\\", and states that \\"We don‚Äôt get much more than imaginative hints, but in these quantities that might be all you need. Instead of developing one situation, try blitzing the players with a bunch of them.

Facts Arbuthnot sought a declaration that Havelet Leasing Ltd, whose plane and coach hire business had gone insolvent, had defrauded its creditors by transferring its business, assets and contracts to the related Havelet Leasing Finance Ltd. Arbuthnot had financed part of Havelet's business, and it owned some of the vehicles which were leased to Havelet. When Havelet fell into arrears, Arbuthnot obtained a judgment and appointed a receiver. They then found that Havelet had transferred its business, assets and benefits of all Havelet's agreements to a third company (Havelet Leasing Finance Ltd). Havelet's lessees were paying Havelet Leasing Finance, which in turn paid Havelet in quarterly arrears. This was contended to be a fraudulent scheme to elevate the owner of Havelet in priority after insolvency. Judgment Scott J held that the transfer would be reversed, that all assets in Havelet Leasing Finance's possession were held on trust for Havelet, without prejudice to Havelet Leasing Finance's creditors. He said that although the motive was not necessarily dishonest (on the basis that Havelet's lawyers had advised Havelet that it was not), the purpose of the transfer was to put the assets out of Arbuthnot's reach, it was still done with the purpose of putting assets beyond creditors' reach and thus was a fraudulent transaction and void.

In addition to the range of goods sold by his father, which included bobbin lace yarn and products of all kinds, he built another mainstay as a fine-art publisher. Embarking on numerous walking tours throughout the local area he took photographs of the countryside, local culture and places of natural beauty with his camera. Over the years he created several thousand picture postcards of his home area, which contributed to the increase in tourism of the Ore Mountains. He was also a member of the Ore Mountain Club.

History The band were formed in 2002 in Bayonne, France. In 2005, they released their debut, a double CD with three tracks. Since then the band have released new albums almost annually; they have also released various EPs, singles and splits with Moss, the Grey Daturas and Elysi√ºm. Monarch have released with various labels, mainly with the Spanish Throne Records and have signed with US label At A Loss Recordings, which will release their new record, Omens. Monarch have toured frequently outside France; in the beginning of 2010 they played alongside Wolves in the Throne Room in Australia, and 2010‚Äì2011 Monarch toured North America, Japan and Australia. Music The band states doom metal and sludge metal bands like Noothgrush, Corrupted, Burning Witch and The Melvins as main influences, but emphasizes with the note \\"but mainly Black Sabbath\\" the special importance of the classic metal band. Their 2010 album stresses this through its title, Sabbat Noir, French for Black Sabbath. Eduardo Rivadavia from AllMusic sees their sound as similar to drone metal like Khanate and Rigor Sardonicous, but often harsher. British magazine Rock-A-Rolla considers the band to be rooted in modern doom metal. Monarch have also shown appreciation and claim to be influenced by Norwegian black metal band Darkthrone, and several D-beat bands such as Discharge, Disclose and Aghast;https://www.facebook.com/pages/Monarch/121146434822?sk=info and covered songs by Turbonegro and Discharge, among others. =Concept= Emilie Bresson, Berlin 2015 Since their founding the band's concept did not change drastically; guitarist Ka√Ødine described as follows: \\"The main idea was to play slow and loud as fuck. We were all playing in fast bands so we wanted to play something very different, something new and challenging for us.\\" Monarch tracks are quite long, roundabout 20 minutes, and to date the longest is the song \\"Amplifire Death March\\", which is 58:27 minutes long and was released in 2006 as part of a split. The track length causes the band to release albums almost annually. =Songwriting= Robert MacManus & MicHell Bidegain, Berlin 2015 Their songwriting is not systematic, leaving room for random events and improvisation. The interaction with the amplifiers is very important; bassist MicHell states: \\"The raw material we work with emanates directly from our amps. [‚Ä¶] In that sense there‚Äôs actually a physical dimension in our songwriting: seeing how the amps will respond differently according to how we position ourselves in front of them to achieve, for example, a more droning effect, or harsher feedback‚Ä¶ So we can‚Äôt really write a song unless we‚Äôre in front of stacks of loud amps.‚Äù The instrumentation is quite minimalistic. Guitarists and bassist are working with amplifiers by Sovtek, Acoustic, Orange, Hiwatt, Sunn and Marshall plus fuzzboxes. The singer uses delay- and reverb-pedals. Reception After the reissue of Mer Morte, Lords Of Metal called the band a \\"deep black minimalistic, slow, humongous doom monster\\". Maelstrom called Monarch 2007 in a review of Dead Men Tell No Tales \\"soon-to- be doom titans\\", emphasizing the album to be a challenge for every doom metal fan, though \\"it's worth it, as Monarch! have some fantastic music\\". Reviewing the same album, Heathen Harvest states that it by no means bad, but calls Monarch a copycat of pioneering bands like Boris, Pelican, Isis and Khanate. German metal.de called the 2007 album Speak Of The Sea \\"meaningless drone tracks, which basic idea almost too obviously and thus bold was stolen from Khanate\\". Vampster was impressed 2010 by the album Sabbat Noir and Monarch's \\"undeviating path to dissolve any music into noise\\" and states that \\"neither Switchblade nor Black Shape of Nexus, Corrupted, Black Boned Angel, Nadja or Moss deliver more vehement antimusic than Monarch\\". Beside the band's extremism the reviewer is recognizing something new too: \\"This is what sludge is going to be, when one keeps moving along way outside drone doom, to try something different. [‚Ä¶] The fact is neither drone nor doom can be more extreme without turning to pure noise. Monarch pay tribute to Black Sabbath also by making earth shaking music and in trying something new with a lot of courage and a portion of madness not to underrate [‚Ä¶]\\". Village Voice called a New York concert in November 2010 \\"a focused, intense performance, utterly lacking the catharsis that's metal's usual stock-in-trade\\".

In Japanese mythology, he was the source for Ban no Yoshio, god of pestilence. Arson On the tenth day of the third month of 866, Tomo no Yoshio set fire to the ≈åtenmon gate with the intent of placing blame on the minister of the left, the sadajin Minamoto no Makoto. Arson has always been a serious crime in Japan, and the punishment throughout most of history has typically been execution. Yoshio was able to convince the minister on the right, udajin Fujiwara no Yoshimi, that Makoto was behind the arson. As a result, Yoshimi attempted to get the counsellor Fujiwara no Mototsune to arrest Makoto. However, instead of making the arrest, Mototsune informed his father, the Daij≈ç Daijin, Fujiwara no Yoshifusa, of the situation. Yoshifusa was unconvinced that Makoto could do such a heinous crime and called for the emperor in an attempt to vouch for Makoto‚Äôs innocence and straighten out the matter at hand. As a result, Makoto was left unpunished and a consolation was sent to him. It wasn‚Äôt until the eight month of that year, that the burning of ≈åtenmon gate was attributed to Tomo no Yoshio and his allies due to a report made by ≈åyake no Takatori. A thorough investigation was carried out and on the twenty-second day of the ninth month, Tomo no Yoshio was exiled to Izu Province. This story appears to have been passed down through story telling for many generations, becoming widely known. The historical account can be found in Sandai Jitsuroku.

Although the crime is not detailed there, it clearly refers to the burning of ≈åtenmon gate and his exile to Izu as punishment. The story portrays Ban no Yoshio‚Äôs knowledge of the seriousness of his act and the justice of his punishment.

Friedrich Heinrich Feuerbach (29 September 1806 ‚Äì 24 January 1880) was a German philologist and philosopher. In the 1840s he played an important role disseminating materialist and atheist philosophy. Life Friedrich Feuerbach was born on 29 September 1806 in Munich. He was the youngest son of the distinguished jurist Paul Johann Anselm Ritter von Feuerbach (1775‚Äì1833) and uncle of painter Anselm Feuerbach (1829‚Äì1880). His older brothers were all distinguished scholars. *Joseph Anselm Feuerbach (1798‚Äì1851), father of the painter, was a philologist and archeologist; *Karl Wilhelm Feuerbach (1800‚Äì1834) was a noted mathematician; *Eduard August Feuerbach (1803‚Äì1843) was a scholar of jurisprudence; *Ludwig Andreas Feuerbach (1804‚Äì1872) was a philosopher and anthropologist who influenced Karl Marx. Friedrich also had three sisters: Rebekka Magdalena \\"Helene\\" Feuerbach von Dobeneck (1808‚Äì1891), Leonore Feuerbach (1809‚Äì1885), Elise Feuerbach (1813‚Äì1883). Cf. Meyers Konversations-Lexikon. 4th edition, vol. 6, Bibliographisches Institut, Leipzig, 1885‚Äì1892. In 1826 he began his studies at the university of Erlangen. At first he studied theology, then history and finally philology and philosophy, specializing in Sanskrit literature. His supervisor was Friedrich R√ºckert. At Erlangen he was a member of a liberal nationalist student fraternity. In 1831, shortly after graduating, he went to Paris to work with the noted philologists and linguists Ch√©zy, Bournouf and Remusat. France had recently experienced the July Revolution, and Friedrich met with some of the French utopian socialists of the time (e.g., Pierre Leroux). He also seems to have travelled to Switzerland, where he met the radical followers of Wilhelm Weitling; some of them subsequently studied his writings on religion.Wilhelm Marr seems to have been the conduit; in the 1840s he helped publish Friedrich Feuerbach's writings on religion in Switzerland. Marr was the author of Das junge Deutschland in der Schweiz. Ein Beitrag zur Geschichte der geheimen Verbindungen unserer Tage. Leipzig, 1846. (Young Germany in Switzerland: A Contribution to the History of the Secret Societies of Our Days.) To Ludwig Feuerbach's chagrin, conservative newspapers connected the Feuerbach brothers with the 'unmeasured revolutionism' of these circles. Cf: Schuffenhauer, W., Introduction to: 'Ludwig Feuerbach stellt des Bruders Schrift Gedanken und Thatsachen, 1862, vor.' Berlin, 1990. There is no evidence, however, that Friedrich Feuerbach himself ever participated in any revolutionary association (nor would this have been in character with his diffident nature). On his return to Germany Feuerbach did not seek a profession but instead took rented rooms in Nuremberg and lived on a small state pension. He lived that way for most of his life. Friedrich Feuerbach published several translations from Sanskrit, Spanish, Italian and French. In the 1830s he was associated with the Young German movement in literature; in the early 1840s he contributed to a number of Young Hegelian magazines. Friedrich Freuerbach is described as extremely shy and withdrawn. His brother Ludwig described him as utterly undemanding. The suicide attempt of his older brother Karl, the mathematician, who had been arrested for belonging to a liberal student fraternity in 1824, seems to have greatly affected Friedrich. He was with Karl during his battle with mental illness and when he died prematurely in 1834. The physician Dr. Theodor Spoerri, a family friend, thought he suffered from \\"heaviness of the blood\\" (depression). He also thought that the \\"genius\\" of the talented Feuerbach family was most concentrated in Friedrich, the least-known brother.Spoerri, Th., Genie und Krankheit. Basel/New York, 1851, pp. 73 ff. The philosopher Georg Friedrich Daumer was one of his few occasional visitors. The liberal theologian Johann Heinrich Wichern also acknowledged his influence. Friedrich Feuerbach was a qualified Orientalist with several publications. However, under the influence of his brother Ludwig, he turned to philosophy. He expounded a critique of religion that was heavily indebted to his brother's. He professed \\"to preach what he taught.\\"Meyers... op. cit., p. 203. Friedrich often actively assisted Ludwig in editing his manuscripts. In spite of his atheism, Friedrich seems to have sympathized with a local liberal Protestant 'free faith' group. He died in Nuremberg on 24 January 1880. Views Friedrich Feuerbach shared his brother Ludwig's materialistic humanism. However, he focused less on his brother's theories of the origin of religious alienation and more on the practical implications of religion. Religion requires of the believer \\"a perpetual sacrifice of his autonomous thinking.\\"Cp. Feuerbach, F., Die Religion der Zukunft. Zurich, 1843, pp. 2-5. The desire for happiness is the most powerful human drive, but it can be fulfilled only if (a) human beings know their essential nature (Wesen) and (b) they love it. Christianity interferes with the first by replacing science with superstition; it hinders the second by portraying human beings as hopelessly weak and dependent on the will of an almighty God.Ibid, p. 7 ff. et passim. It is the task of the State, through education and enlightened laws, to provide the material conditions of happiness. To do this, the State must emancipate itself from the influence of the Church. Although Church and State seem symbiotic, the priesthood merely a spiritual police force to complement the secular, in essence Church and State are in conflict: The essence and instrument of the State is the law, but the Church demands of believers obedience to the absolute will of God. As law is in conflict with arbitrary will, so the role of citizen is in conflict with that of believer. So the State must become secular, although Feuerbach acknowledges it will be difficult to remove religion from the minds of the people.Cp. op. cit., pp. 33-38 et passim. The means to social reform is through education. Friedrich Feuebach's political ideal may be described as a kind of utopian socialism: a benevolent secular State that provides people with a scientific education, organises conditions of life rationally and encourages mutual love and assistance.\\"If love of humanity is understood as a personal and emotional sympathy with all human beings, then no one can be obligated to it. Personal sympathy cannot be commanded at all, and can always only relate to a few. Love of humanity, taken rationally, which can indeed be made a duty for everyone, means as much as: recognition of the universal human rights of each and recognition of the claims of each on me, and according to my powers and means to further him in all that is socially lawful [landesgesetzlich erlaubt]. ‚Ä¶ The main point is that the individual thinks and works not only for himself but also for others; it matters less whether he lives among men but rather, that he lives for them.\\" Feuerbach, F., Gedanken und Tatsachen. Ein Beitrag zur Verst√§ndigung √ºber die wichtigsten Bedingungen des Menschenwohles Tr. V.I. Chastra. Hamburg, 1862, p. 3. Although Friedrich Feurbach humbly thought of himself as a mere disseminator of his brother Ludwig's ideas, there were differences between them. Ludwig's distinctive analysis of the concept of God as alienated 'species being' played little role in Friedrich's writings; Friedrich focused on the nefarious implications of God as absolute arbitrary willpower. The note of social radicalism of the professed 'communist' Ludwig was largely absent from Friedrich, who never clarified whether the secular state he envisioned presiding over a society based on mutual aid, could be established by the existing government by enlightened reform from above, or required a more radical change of system. Another difference concerns the role Friedrich Feuerbach assigns to the secular State in establishing conditions of universal happiness and enlightenment about religion; Ludwig Feuerbach places much less emphasis on the state and seems rather more hostile to it.In general, Ludwig seems more influenced by the anarchistic streak in Young Hegelian thought, as seen in Stirner, Bakunin and the Marx of Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right (1843). In 2018 the Center of International Feuerbach Researchhttps://www.uni- muenster.de/EW/forschung/forschungsstellen/feuerbach/arbeitsstelle/index.html at the University of M√ºnster published the results of a conference concerning the relationship of Friedrich and Ludwig Feuerbach.https://www.waxmann.com/waxmann- buecher/?no_cache=1&tx;_p2waxmann_pi2%5Bbuch%5D=BUC125647&tx;_p2waxmann_pi2%5Baction%5D=show&tx;_p2waxmann_pi2%5Bcontroller%5D=Buch&cHash;=d4a319e642e7e51306df218fd684dd2e Friedrich Feuerbach's Religion of Future was interpreted as a practical concept of a secular and public education to bring democracy forward. Following this view Wilhelm Marr misinterpreted the philosophy of the Feuerbachbrothers to an alarming extent.ibid. p 7; cf. Ursula Reitemeyer: Unter Verdacht.

Listed at , 125 lb., Pearson batted and threw right-handed. She was nicknamed ‚Ä≥Dolly\\". The All-American Girls Professional Baseball League flourished in the 1940s when Major League Baseball went on hold as men went to World War II. The league was created in 1943 by the Chicago Cubs' owner Philip K. Wrigley, and disbanded at the end of the 1954 season. In its twelve years of history, the AAGPBL gave over 600 women athletes the opportunity to play professional baseball and to play it at a level never before attained. During her seven-year tenure in the AAGPBL, Dolly Pearson moved around for a while, playing for seven different clubs in seven different cities as the league shifted players as needed to help weak teams stay afloat. A versatile utility, she played all positions except catcher before becoming a regular shortstop. Pearson never had the opportunity to play for a pennant contender or a champion team. After her baseball career was over, Pearson made a name for herself promoting youth sports activities to provide a safe and family-oriented environment on the field, which gained her induction in several Halls of Fame. Born in the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania neighborhood of Hazelwood, Pearson was the daughter of William and Retha (Hayes) Pearson. She attended Allderdice High School. She was playing sandlot baseball with the boys and was gaining a reputation. And a AAGPBL scout caught wind, and signed Pearson at the age of 14 nearing 15, the youngest player ever to play in the league.Encyclopedia of Women and Baseball ‚Äì Leslie A. Heaphy, Mel Anthony May. Publisher: McFarland & Company, 2006. Format: Paperback, 438 pp. Language: English.

Pearson entered the league in 1948 with the Muskegon Lassies, playing for them for one year before joining the Peoria Redwings (1949), Racine Belles (1950), Battle Creek Belles (1951), Kalamazoo Lassies (1951‚Äì1952), South Bend Blue Sox (1953) and Grand Rapids Chicks (1954). On the last day of her rookie season, Pearson celebrated her 16th birthday to everybody's surprise, because everyone thought she was already 16 (the minimum age according to the rules), so she had played illegally all year. In addition to Dolly, she also received one of the more unusual nicknames in the AAGPBL ‚Äì \\"Buttons\\". Pearson received her curious nickname on a trip with the club, when she wanted to play with all the push-buttons in the train. Overall, Pearson appeared in 82 games and hit .182 with 15 runs and 12 RBI.Encyclopedia of Women and BaseballThe Women of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League In 1949, Pearson batted .216 with Peoria, playing only in 30 games at various positions. At Racine the next year, she started at center field and posted a .235 average with 41 runs and 47 RBI in a career-high 110 games. Then in 1951 she found herself on the move again, this time to Battle Creek, where she started at shortstop, the position she would play for the rest of her career. In addition, she was sent to Kalamazoo in the midseason, combining for a .190 average in 100 games for both teams. Pearson hit .185 in 44 games for Kalamazoo in 1952 and moved to South Bend in 1953. She appeared in 90 games for the Blue Sox, batting .185 with 29 RBI and 38 runs scored, being selected for the All-Star Team in 1953. Then she joined Grand Rapids in 1954, during what turned out to be the AAGPBL's final season. The league reduced the size of the ball 10 inches to major league size that year. As a result, Pearson started hitting the ball with authority and posted a .327 average w/272 at bats, 18 home runs, 10 stolen bases, a slugging percentage of .544, driving in 57 runs while scoring 68 times, setting career- marks. In 85 games, she committed 29 errors in 350 chances for a .917 fielding average. Once the league folded, Dolly settled in Grand Rapids, Michigan for 15 years before moving to Mount Pleasant, Michigan. She started playing slow- pitch softball, playing until the age of 65, where her club won 18 championships. She married Edward Tesseine in 1955. The couple raised four children: Retha, Sam, Ron and Ed, and had five grandchildren; Taylon, Kaedria (Sam), Stacy, Rodney and Russell (Retha). She worked in the Central Michigan University athletics department for several years, while helping her husband run the bar they owned at Mount Pleasant, E.J.'s Lounge, until 1981. Widowed in 1991, Pearson retired in 1994 and was involved in the Foster Grandparents Program. Children were always an integral part of her life, as she started the first T-ball program in Mt. Pleasant. She also trained and coached boys' baseball and girls' softball at various levels in the Michigan area, and coached senior girls' bowling for many years. She was the Grand Rapids, Michigan City Woman's singles' bowling Champion in 1968. Honors and awards Since 1988 she is part of Women in Baseball, a permanent display based at the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New York, which was unveiled to honor the entire All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. She also gained inductions into the Grand Rapids Sports Hall of Fame, the Michigan Amateur Softball Association Hall of Fame, the Michigan State Softball Hall of Fame, and the Mount Pleasant Bowlers Hall of Fame. Dolly Pearson died at her home in Mount Pleasant, Michigan at the age of 72.

In this case, the court examined whether a series of arrangements could be understood as one \\"transaction\\" for the purposes of being an undervalue transaction under the Insolvency Act 1986. Ultimately, the court found that, for the purposes of insolvency law, it may be appropriate to consider details of a complex series of linked transactions to assess whether the transaction was undertaken at an ‚Äòundervalue‚Äô. Facts Mr Phillips, the liquidator of AJ Bekhor & Co, sought to recover the ¬£725,000 and interest for a business and asset that had been transferred to a subsidiary, which in turn was bought by Brewin Dolphin (asset management firm in London) through a share purchase for ¬£1. The question was whether this constituted a transaction at an undervalue contrary to the Insolvency Act 1986 section 238. Brewin Dolphin contended that part of the agreement was that its parent company, Private Capital Group Ltd, would pay AJ Bekhor four yearly instalments of ¬£312,000 for renting computer equipment. The covenant for the rental had been sublet to BD by AJB despite an absolute bar in the head lease. The trial judge and the Court of Appeal[1999] 1 WLR 2052 refused to take the computer rental agreement into account, as part of consideration for the share transaction. Judgment The House of Lords held that the transaction was effected at an undervalue, was voidable under section 238. The computer rental agreement was taken as consideration for the deal, but when assessing its value, reality and not speculative values should not be taken into account. The collateral agreement was precarious, and worthless because the headlessors had immediately declared the transaction to be a repudiatory breach, and it therefore had no value to Brewin Dolphin.

The court should validate transactions to ensure that unsecured creditors will not be prejudiced, applications for specific transactions have to show proof there will be no prejudice, and the more speculative a transaction is, the more unlikely it should be approved.

Registration An aircraft registration is a unique alphanumeric string that identifies a civil aircraft, in similar fashion to a number plate on a vehicle. The letter Q has not been used since the issue of G-EBTQ in 1927 (although a few historic aircraft still maintain registrations with this letter), and the CAA also disallows combinations that may be offensive. In accordance with the Convention on International Civil Aviation all aircraft must be registered with a national aviation authority and they must carry proof of this registration in the form of a legal document called a Certificate of Registration at all times when in operation. The register is maintained by the United Kingdom Civil Aviation Authority.United Kingdom Civil Aviation Authority Registration Information Home Page Temporary register 1919 Although aircraft had been flown in the United Kingdom since 1908 they were not registered and were not required to carry any external markings. The principle of registering and externally marking aircraft had been agreed upon in 1910 at an international convention in Paris and a draft Air Navigation Order had been prepared in 1911, but was not put into force before the First World War. With the end of the First World War the Air Navigation Regulations came into force on 20 April 1919, allowing civil flying to commence on 1 May 1919. The regulation stated that all aircraft must carry registration marks and any passenger-carrying aircraft must have a certificate of airworthiness. The International Air Navigation Conference in Paris had not concluded, so a temporary system was started; former military aircraft would retain military serials and any new or re-built aircraft would be registered in a sequence starting with K-100. The first civil flight under the new regulations took place on 1 May 1919 when a de Havilland DH.9 of Aircraft Transport and Travel flew from Hounslow to Bournemouth using former military serial C6054 as an identity. The \\"K series\\" registrations allocated were in the range K-100 to K-175, with K-169 being the highest known to have been used. First permanent register 1919-1929 The Paris International Conference had allocated the British Empire the prefix G followed by four other letters. The United Kingdom decided to use the G-Exxx sequence for heavier-than-air aircraft (for example G-EAAA) and \\"G-Fxxx\\" for lighter-than-air aircraft. The new register came into force on 22 July 1919; aircraft flying on temporary former military serials and those allotted in the K-100 sequence were all re-registered sequentially from G-EAAA. *G-EAAA to G-EZZZ Heavier-than-air aircraft. G-EAAA to G-EBZZ and G-EDCA were allocated. *G-FAAA to G-FZZZ Lighter-than-air aircraft. G-FAAA to G-FAAX were allocated. *G-AUAA to G-AUZZ was allocated to Australia (1921‚Äì1929) replaced by VH-xxx. *G-CAAA to G-CAZZ was allocated to Canada (1920‚Äì1929) replaced by CF-xxx. *G-CYAA to G-CYZZ was allocated to Canada for government and military aircraft (1920‚Äì1929). *G-IAAA to G-IAZZ was allocated to India (1920‚Äì1928) replaced by VT-xxx. *G-NZAA to G-NZZZ was allocated to New Zealand (1921‚Äì1929) replaced by ZK-xxx. *G-UAAA to G-UAZZ was allocated to the Union of South Africa (1927‚Äì1929) replaced by ZS-xxx. Second permanent register 1928- At the 1927 International Radio-Telegraph Conference the United Kingdom was allocated radio callsign prefixes B, G, M, VP, VQ and VR. Within this new allocation the United Kingdom continued to use the prefix G- for all aircraft but the sequence was restarted at G-AAAA, which continued into the 21st century. The first registration in the sequence, G-AAAA, was allocated to a de Havilland Gipsy Moth, registered on 30 July 1928 to Geoffrey de Havilland. At first nearly all registrations were issued in sequential alphabetical order but since the 1970s personalised (\\"out of sequence\\") registrations are available using any four-letter combination. Except in very rare circumstances, no registration is ever re-issued to a different aircraft. Countries in the British Empire that had used the G- prefix were allocated new two-letter allocations. The oldest flyable aircraft in the world as of 2011, a Humber-built Bleriot XI from 1909 owned by the Shuttleworth Collection in the UK, still uses the very early form registration G-AANG. =Microlights= From 1981 until 1998 most microlights were registered in the G-MBAA/MZZZ sequence but that system was officially discontinued and microlights have since been registered with any unused suffix. =Gliders= In 1937 the sequence G-GAAA to G-GAAE was used for five gliders to operate in an international competition in Germany. To comply with the regulations of the European Aviation Safety Agency, all gliders have had to be registered and marked externally in the G-xxxx sequence since 2008, except for a small group of specified vintage types known by the name of the EASA document, Annex 2.United Kingdom Civil Aviation Authority Information Specific to Gliders From 1930 to 2008, existing gliders did not need to be registered in the G- sequence but were recorded on a separate register held by the British Gliding Association. (Newly built gliders from 2003 were G- registered immediately.) The BGA register started in numerical sequence with BGA.101. Although gliders were always marked externally by the BGA numbers, these registrations were usually displayed in very small characters. Later the BGA also issued a three-letter code (called a trigraph) in sequence with the BGA number and this started with the lowest numbered glider still extant, BGA231 an Abbott-Baynes Scud II, being \\"AAA\\". When the majority of British gliders were registered in 2008, the G- registration often was derived from the trigraph letters preceded by G-C- or G-D-, though there were many personalised registrations issued which did not follow this pattern. In addition to the registration many gliders still show a large trigraph or competition number on the fin and on the underside of a wing. The 'comp' numbers are also issued by the BGA. These consisted of three-digit numbers at first but later could be any three alpha-numeric characters. The comp number or the trigraph is usually the most visible marking on a British glider. =Hovercraft= Air cushion vehicles were allocated registrations with the prefix 'GH-', e.g., GH-2012, the BHC SR.N6 that carried out the first hovercraft expedition up the Amazon, and the Mountbatten-class SR.N4's GH-2006 Princess Margaret and GH-2004 Swift. =Toy balloons= From 1982 the sequence G-FYAA to G-FYNA was used for unmanned toy balloons. =Concorde= A special sequence was allocated for Concorde aircraft to allow the use of the aircraft on internal services in the United States by the former US-based airline, Braniff International Airways. For example, the former G-BOAC was re- registered as G-N81AC so on arrival at Washington-Dulles, the \\"G\\" could be covered up and the United States registration N-81AC could be used for internal flights.

In 1947, he led the Class-B Colonial League with a 2.34 ERA while going 12‚Äì7 in 22 pitching appearances. His most productive season came in 1950, when he posted a 20‚Äì14 record with a 2.94 ERA and was selected for the Florida International League All-Star team.Baseball Players of the 1950s Finally, Murray had his chance to play in the major leagues when he joined the last-place Athletics on August 17, 1950. He lost all three of his decisions in eight games (two starts), allowing 20 runs (19 earned) on 34 hits and 21 walks while striking out eight batters. He registered a 5.70 ERA in 30 innings of work. After his brief stint with the Athletics, Murray returned to the minors and pitched from 1951 through 1953. In an eleven-season career, he finished with a 111‚Äì113 mark and a 3.87 ERA in 344 games. He later managed the Wytheville Statesmen of the Appalachian League in 1954. When his baseball career ended, Murray went to work for Union Carbide and later worked as a construction company roofing contractor. He was a long- time resident of San Clemente, California, where he died at the age of 80.

In 1946 Small sent representatives to Britain to scout locations. He said he wanted to make the film on location in Scotland. Charles Bennett and George Bruce worked on the early drafts of the script. In 1948 Small said he would make the film as co- production with J Arthur Rank starring Louis Hayward . In 1948 Alfred Hitchcock announced plans to film the novel for Transatlantic Pictures. Small claimed he had registered the title in the US; Hitchcock could film the story but would not be able to call it Lorna Doone in the US. This prompted Small to announce he would start filming in England in association with Rank and producer John Beck on 1 March 1949. This was postponed due to the US‚ÄìEnglish film trade war of 1948‚Äì19 and in August 1949 filming was put back indefinitely. The project was reactivated later in 1949 when Small signed a two-picture deal with Columbia Pictures, for Lorna Doone and The Brigand. =Shooting= It was decided to make the movie in Hollywood, with locations shot at Yosemite National Park.

K. Raut () is a Nepalese computer scientist, author and activist. He was active in the Alliance for Independent Madhesh, to establish a country for the Madhesi people. He is often placed under house- arrest by the Government of Nepal. The movement for another single country took the formation of Janamat Party in 2019. Early life Raut was born in Mahadeva Village, in the Saptari district, Sagarmatha Zone of Nepal. He attended primary school in his village and high school in Laxmi Ballav Narsingh Secondary School in Babhangama Katti. He went on to study at Tribhuvan University (Nepal), Tokyo University (Japan) and Cambridge University (UK). He is a recipient of Young Nepalese Engineer Award, Mahendra Bidhya Bhusan, Kulratna Gold Medal, and Trofimenkoff Academic Achievement Award. Arrest On 13 September 2014, the Government of Nepal arrested Raut for on the grounds of sedition after giving a speech to a gathering of Santhals, an indigenous population of Nepalese, in their annual festival. After his arrest, Raut began to fast in protest, arguing that his right to freedom and expression was being violated by the government. He was subsequently hospitalized on 25 September after complaints of severe stomach pain. Nepali Congress Vice-President Ram Chandra Poudel, Minister for Information and Communications Minendra Rijal, and Agriculture Minister Hari Parajuli visited Raut in the hospital to urge him to end his fast. Raut ended his fast on the 1 October, after 11 days, upon the Nepalese government's request and commitment to respect freedom of expression. The Attorney Office filed a sedition case at the Special Court on 8 October. International support New York City based Human Rights Watch issued this statement on the arrest and subsequent filing of sedition charges against Raut. The Nepal authorities should immediately withdraw sedition charges and unconditionally release rights campaigner Chandra Kant Raut. His arrest threatens the chances of a robust debate on federalism, and undermines the promise of inclusion. Raut's arrest shows that minority voices can and will be easily sidelined. Asian Human Rights Commission stated, that everyone has the rights to freedom of speech, movement, peaceful assembly and association are the fundamental rights of all human beings everywhere, as also mandated by the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, of which Nepal is a signatory, we expect acknowledgement and assurance of our rights from the state and its agencies. The AHRC urges the government of Nepal to immediately release Dr Chandra Kant Raut. The AHRC fears possible torture, harassment and other ill treatment during their arbitrary arrest by the Morang Police.\\" Amnesty International also wrote a letter to the Nepalese Minister for Home Affairs, demanding Raut's release. Speech in Biratnagar On 3 January 2015, Raut was again arrested while giving a speech at Jutwa College. Many supporters were injured following a clash with police. A dozen police personnel were also injured. Raut's supporters claimed police had used brutal force and did not allow him to be hospitalised locally for injuries incurred during the clash. Alliance for Independent Madhesh Raut is the president and the founding member of Alliance for Independent Madhesh, which in its manifesto has described itself as a coalition of Terai people discriminated by Pahadi civilisation. It has people of various sub-ethnicities, activists, parties and various organisations who are working towards establishing an independent Madhesh. Although it was established in 2007, it did not announce their manifesto until a press conference in Kathmandu on 21 May 2012. The manifesto states the main objective of the alliance is to achieve independence of Madhesh through peaceful and non-violent means. It has also demanded an end an end to racism, slavery and discrimination imposed on Nepali people of Madheshi origin by the Pahadi people. It claims to have three pillars: independent Madhesh of Nepal, non-violence and peaceful means, and a democratic system. Janamat Party formation Janamat Party was formed by Raut on 18 March 2019.

Academic career Pamela took up a post as a research fellow in epidemiology to enable her to continue working whilst raising a family. She was a member of the UK national working party concerned with data recording in cerebral palsy research from 1985 to the early 1990s. She has published various papers in the field and was invited to deliver a paper at a UCLA conference ('Epidemiology of the Cerebral Palsies: a Foundation for Research and Prevention') in 1986. She developed the \\"Limb by Limb\\" method of data recording, a standardised methodology for clinicians providing data to epidemiologists. Before this method was described, different interpretations of commonly used terms (e.g. diplegia, hemiplegia and quadriplegia) meant that data recorded in studies were not always able to be assessed correctly at an epidemiological level. The \\"Limb by Limb\\" method stimulated a debate among other researchersGoogle Scholar references to \\"A standard form for recording clinical findings in children with a motor deficit of central origin\\" about the best format for data recording in epidemiological studies, providing a basis from which other recording methodologies could be derived. Her work on the life expectancy of children affected by cerebral palsy has been used as evidence in the High Court.

The F-15J was produced under license by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. The subsequent F-15DJ and F-15J Kai variants were also produced. Japan is the largest customer of the F-15 Eagle outside the United States.Rininger 2009, p. 150. In addition to combat, F-15DJ roles include training. The F-15J Kai is a modernized version of the F-15J. Development In June‚ÄìJuly 1975, the Japan Defense Agency (JDA, now Ministry of Defense) examined the McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle as one of the 13 candidates for the replacement of the F-104J/DJ Starfighter and F-4EJ Phantom II. A single-seat F-15C and a twin-seat F-15D were evaluated at Edwards Air Force Base, and in December 1975, the F-15 was announced the winner, with the government intending to purchase 187 F-15J/DJs. By April 1978, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries was designated as the primary contractor and licensing for the F-15C/D was achieved.Davies and Dildy 2007, p. 152.Jenkins 1998, p. 38. After congressional review, the Department of Defense (DoD) withheld the aircraft's electronic warfare and engine systems from the licensing. Initially, the aircraft were produced in the U.S. and exported to Japan. This initial export production contributed to aircraft development under the defense industry of Japan while facilitating base production of aircraft, achieving the goal of producing a fighter to Japan's requirements.Lorell, 1996. p.77‚Äì78 The Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF) acquired 203 F-15Js and 20 F-15DJs, of which 2 F-15Js and 12 F-15DJs were built by McDonnell Douglas in St. Louis, Missouri. Dubbed the \\"Peace Eagle\\" by the DoD FMS program, the first F-15J built in St. Louis was delivered to the United States Air Force for its first flight on 4 June 1980, and a subsequent cruise on 15 July to Japan. Additionally, 8 F-15Js were manufactured in large components and shipped to Japan for final assembly by Komaki of Mitsubishi, the first of these (serial number 12‚Äì8803) making its maiden flight on 26 August 1981. Companies divided the remainder share and produced it under license from 1981, with final assembly of aircraft performed by Mitsubishi. In 1980, the Japanese government applied for access to advanced technology through the U.S.-Japan Forum (S&TF;) but this was rejected. The JDA and the DoD held annual meetings about relaxation of the regulation after a program was started. In these meetings, the DoD official gave an answer that permitted access to initially prohibited technology of various types including composite material.Lorell, 1996. p.79 In the latter period of 1981, the first F-15J/DJ aircraft were sent to 202nd Tactical Fighter Squadron, which was reorganized as an Eagle FTU and renamed the 23 Flying Training Squadron at Nyutabaru base on 21 December 1982. The JASDF developed a plan to form the first squadron after the KAL007 shootdown by a Soviet Su-15 on 1 September 1983. In March 1984, new F-15Js began replacing the 203rd Tactical Fighter Squadron's F-104Js at Chitose Air Base, located across the La P√©rouse Strait from the Soviet fighter base on Sakhalin Island. On 24 December 2018, it was announced that Japan is seriously considering selling their F-15s to the U.S. in order to acquire funds to purchase F-35s.https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/Japan-wants-to-sell- old-F-15s-to-US-to-fund-F-35-purchases The U.S. would then consider selling those F-15s to friendly countries with weaker air forces. Design ECM antenna position of Mitsubishi F-15J MSIP (2005) F-15J/DJs are identical to F-15C/Ds aside from the ECM, radar warning system, and nuclear equipment. The AN/ALQ-135 Internal Countermeasures System is replaced by the indigenous J/ALQ-8 and the AN/ALR-56 Radar Warning Receiver is replaced by the J/APR-4. The engine is the Pratt & Whitney F100 turbofan, produced under license by IHI Corporation. Some aircraft still have an inertial measurement unit, an old type of the Inertial navigation system. All F-15J/DJs have two UHF radios, which are also VHF capable.Davies and Dildy 2007, p. 153. The F-15J is characterized by an indigenous data link, but they do not support Link 16 FDL mounted by USAF F-15Cs. It works as a basic bidirectional link with the Japanese ground-controlled intercept network, and it is limited because it is not a true network. Mitsubishi received the F-15C/D Multistage Improvement Program (MSIP) and in 1987 began upgrading the F-15J/DJs. Improvements included an uprated central computer, engines, armament control set and added the J/APQ-1 countermeasures set. The F100-PW-220 (IHI-220) was upgraded to the F100-PW-220E (IHI-220E) with a digital engine electronic control retrofit. Differences in appearance from earlier F-15Js include the J/ALQ-8 ICS with an ICS antenna mounted under the intake. The J/APQ-4 RWR antenna position on the F-15J/DJs is the same as F-15C/Ds, but the lens of F-15J/DJ MSIPs are black rather than white for F-15C/Ds. =Improvements and upgrades= An F-15J after the 2nd phase MTDP modernization with changes visible around the intake (2008) F-15J at Chitose Air Base (2010) F-15Js have been equipped with the Japanese- built AAM-3 missile, an improved AIM-9 Sidewinder follow-on with distinctive \\"barbed\\" forward fins. Japan has been investigating an advanced fighter to replace the F-15, meanwhile the F-15J fleet is being modernised. On 28 July 2003, the first upgraded F-15J (#928) made its first flight, and it was delivered to the JASDF Air Development Test Wing on 21 October 2003. On 10 December 2004, the Japanese Government approved a Mid-Term Defense Program (MTDP) to modernize the F-15J MSIPs over five years in accordance with new National Defense Program Guidelines. The upgrade is being implemented in phases, but ultimately the upgrade will include a new ejection seat; replaced IHI-220E engines; more powerful processor; uprated electrical generation and cooling capabilities to support more avionics and the Raytheon AN/APG-63(V)1 radar. which has been produced under license by Mitsubishi Electric since 1997. Raytheon expects the radar will ultimately be installed in 80 F-15Js.\\"Melco starts F-15J radar upgrade\\". Flight International, 14 March 2006. Retrieved 13 March 2011. The new radar will support the AAM-4 missile, the Japanese answer to the AMRAAM. The Ministry of Defense (MoD) requested the modernization and deployment of reconnaissance aircraft in June 2007, and it was planned to upgrade some F-15Js with synthetic aperture radar pods; these aircraft would replace the RF-4 Phantom IIs currently in service.\\"Lockheed Martin to Upgrade Radar for Reconnaissance Version of Japan's F-15.\\" Lockheed Martin press release, 19 June 2007. On 17 December 2009, the reconnaissance upgrade disappeared from the budget after the Democratic Party of Japan took power following the General Election in 2009, and priority was given instead to improvement of the F-15J and the Mitsubishi F-2. The number of F-15J upgrades was increased from 26 to 48, and the MoD purchased part of the modernization for 38 fighters. However, the full budget for modernization is incomplete. 48 F-15Js will get a Link 16 datalink and helmet-mounted sight. The helmet-mounted sight will support the AAM-5 dogfighting missile, which will replace the AAM-3. On 17 December 2010, modernization was funded for 16 F-15Js but the MoD reduced this to 10 F-15Js. In late October 2019 the US Defense Security Cooperation Agency approved a possible sale to Japan of up to 103 APG-82(v)1 Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) Radars, 116 Advanced Display Core Processor II Mission System Computers and 101 AN/ALQ-239 Digital Electronic Warfare Systems for the upgrade of 98 F-15Js to a \\"Japanese Super Interceptor\\" (JSI) configuration for an estimated cost of $4.5 billion. It can also carry a large air-to-surface weapon on its centerline weapon station, such as an AGM-158B JASSM-ER or AGM-158C LRASM, giving the aircraft an air-to- ground and anti-ship capability.

History Westminster originated in 1951 as a reorganization of Atlanta's North Avenue Presbyterian School (NAPS), a girls' school and an affiliate of the North Avenue Presbyterian Church. Dr. William L. Pressly of Chattanooga, Tennessee's McCallie School served as Westminster's first president. The school moved to its current campus in 1953 as the result of a land grant by trustee Fritz Orr. Also in 1953, Washington Seminary, another private school for girls, founded by two of George Washington's great-nieces in 1878, merged with Westminster. The resulting school was co-educational until the sixth grade, with separate schools for boys and girls continuing through the twelfth grade, a practice that continued until 1986 and provided the basis of Westminster's plural name. In the mid-1950s, Westminster became a test site for a new advanced studies program that would later become the College Board's Advanced Placement program. In 1962, the administration building, later named Pressly Hall, was constructed, bringing the number of permanent buildings on campus to four. In the early 1960s, the school barred black students and only rarely allowed African- Americans on campus. In 1965, the school's trustees voted to adopt a non- discriminatory admissions policy. Until 1978, the school also operated as a boarding school Using Tull hall as a Dormitory. In 2006 the school ran a campaign attempting to raise $100 million to further increase its endowment size. The campaign was at the time the third-largest ever for an independent school in the United States.\\"Teaching For Tomorrow Assures Excellence for Today.\\" Adams, Abby. The Westminster Bi-Line, December 8, 2006. pg. 3. Campus The quadrangle located on Westminster's campus. Westminster is situated on a wooded campus of in the Buckhead community of Atlanta. A new campus road, completed in June 2004, rerouted traffic away from central campus. In addition to a new junior high facility, completed in August 2005, Westminster has five main high school academic buildings ‚Äì Campbell Hall (1952), Askew Hall (1951), and Robinson Hall (1992), Broyles Hall (1987), and Pressly Hall (1962). Pressly Hall houses administrative offices, the Malone Dining Hall, and McCain Chapel. Turner Gymnasium underwent major construction and expansion completed in 2000. Broyles Arts Center houses the orchestra, band, theater, and art programs, and also the Campus Center, an area for students to socialize during free time that includes a concession stand. The recently renovated Scott Hall (2013), once nearly obsolete after the construction of the Junior High School building, now houses the campus bookstore and technology department. Love Hall (1995) serves as the elementary school. Tull Hall, which was once the dorm rooms for boarding students now serves as a preschool. The campus hosted the Atlanta Marathon from 1964 until 1980. During the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, the Torch was run through campus. The floor used for the basketball games during the Olympics is now in the school's Lower School gymnasium. Westminster is currently implementing an extensive campus renovation to enhance teacher-student connection. Campbell Hall is under renovation and a new 28,000-square-foot upper school academic building (Hawkins Hall) is under construction. The football stadium is also being enhanced. A parking garage and a new Wildcat center is also under construction Traditions Current school customs include a student-enforced honor code that forbids lying, cheating, and stealing. In the Middle and Upper Schools, the Honor Council oversees honor violation cases, while the Discipline Council oversees cases involving disciplinary actions not in violation of the honor code. Annual events include the Pigskin Picnic, a performance of Handel's Messiah, WestFest, Christian Emphasis Week, Homecoming, Senior Mudslide, the 5th grade Greek Parade, school-wide Pep Rallies, and Salute to the Arts. Former events include Fieldigras, which was discontinued in 2002, Westafest, which was discontinued in 1994, and Big Day Off, which was discontinued in 2010. Westminster maintains a rivalry with the neighboring Lovett School, as well as other area private schools including Woodward Academy, Marist School, Holy Innocents' Episcopal School, Pace Academy and Blessed Trinity.

These teams have won 286 state championships since 1951, including seven in the 2016‚Äì17 school year. Westminster has received the Georgia Athletic Directors' Association Director's Cup in its respective classification in 17 of the 18 years it has been awarded, 2000‚Äì2008 and 2010‚Äì2017. The varsity boys' tennis team won the Georgia State High School AAA State Championship in ten seasons in a row, 1999‚Äì2009. The boys' team has yielded many Division 1 NCAA scholarship tennis players over the years, and it has won several regional tournaments as well.

Extracurricular activities Westminster places a great deal of focus on extracurricular clubs and activities, with students and faculty devoting time before, during, and after school to these activities. Among the academic extracurricular pursuits are an academic quiz team, debate team, math team, and math honors society. Only one year of an art is required, but many extracurricular opportunities in that field are available to students, including a vocal ensemble and men's and women's a cappella groups, as well as a symphonic band, chorus, orchestra, and theater program. Student publications include Lynx, the annual yearbook, The Westminster Bi-Line, a monthly newspaper publication, Crossroads, a literary magazine in languages other than English, Embryo, an arts, music, and literature magazine, and Evolutions, a poetry and creative writing periodical. Religious and cultural groups on campus showcase the diverse heritage of the student body. A student-run Christian Life Committee oversees that aspect of student life, including many Bible studies and a branch of the Fellowship of Christian Athletes. Other groups of this type include Tikkun Olam, a Jewish fellowship club for junior high students; Nosh, an all-encompassing religious discussion group; and Far Out Far East, a cultural club that explores Eastern cultures and traditions.

Its long title was \\"An act for the more easy and speedy trial of such persons as have levied, or shall levy war against his Majesty; and for the better ascertaining the qualifications of jurors in trials for high treason or misprision of treason, in that part of Great Britain called Scotland.\\" It was one of the Juries (Scotland) Acts 1745 to 1869.The Short Titles Act 1896 section 2(1) and Schedule 2 It enacted that anyone who was prosecuted for high treason could be tried anywhere in England, regardless of where they had first been indicted. Under common law a trial had to take place in the county where the crime happened. The preamble to the Act explained that this change to the law was necessary because many prisoners had been moved to other prisons \\"for safer custody,\\" or taken to London to be questioned, and it would have been inconvenient to transport them all back again. This exception to the rule had first been introduced as a temporary measure in 1715, during the first Jacobite Rising. The Act also changed the criteria for jury service in trials for high treason and misprision of treason committed in Scotland. It was repealed by section 2(1) of, and the Schedule to, the Treason Act 1945. Other legislation Another Act in the same year, 19 Geo.II c.26, stated that people named in the Act would automatically be attainted of treason unless they surrendered to the authorities by 12 July 1746.

The work was created in order to honor the deities of Kasuga, with the stories revolving around the Kasuga shrine and K≈çfukuji temple, located in Nara. The colourful silk work was made with silver and gold paints and consists of 20 scrolls with 93 sections of text and illustrations, which was completed in 1309. Meaning of the name The term ‚ÄúGongen‚Äù means avatar or deity, while the term ‚Äúgenki‚Äù in the title is actually short for ‚Äúreigenki‚Äù; reigenki can be translated into ‚Äúchronicles of marvelous and supernatural events‚Äù. Taken together, the title has been translated into ‚ÄúThe Miracles of the Kasuga Deity‚Äù or ‚ÄúIllustrated Tales of the Miracles of the Avatars of Kasuga‚Äù or the equivalent. And as the title suggests, the work focuses on miraculous events involving the Kasuga Shrine and Buddhist/Shinto deities. Authorship and history The former regent (kanpaku), Takatsukasa (Fujiwara) Mototada, and his three sons wrote the original text, based on stories compiled by a monk named Kakuen of T≈çbokuin, in consultation with two other senior monks of K≈çfuku-ji (Jishin of Daij≈çin and Hanken of Sanz≈çin). Mototada copied out scrolls 1-5, 9-13 and 16; the eldest son, Fuyuhira, copied out scrolls 6-8; the second son, Fuyumoto, copied out scrolls 14, 15, 18 and 19; and the fourth son, Ry≈çshin, copied out scrolls 17 and 18. However, Takashina Takekane, who was the director of the imperial painting bureau (edokoro), created the illustrations. Following the completion of the work, the Minister of the Left (Sadaijin), Saionji Kinhira (who was also a brother to Kakuen), dedicated it to the Kasuga Shrine and neighboring Buddhist temple, K≈çfukuji, in order to honor the deities and thank them for honoring his home. When the scrolls were first completed and kept at the Kasuga shrine, the scrolls were carefully protected‚Äîwith no shrine priest or K≈çfukuji monk less than 40 years of age able to view the scrolls. Moreover, if the scrolls were required at K≈çfukuji, it was only the T≈çbokuin sanctuary that was permitted to receive the scrolls. However, for a while, during the late 18th Century, the scrolls became less carefully looked after. The scrolls were most likely treated more casually because of the decline suffered by Kasuga and K≈çfukuji at the time. In order to make Kasuga Gongen genki e more accessible to the public, copies of the work began to appear during the Edo period. However, permission from the head of the Fujiwara clan was needed before any copies were allowed. Currently there are 6 known copies to be made: one owned by the Kaj≈´ji family, the Y≈çmei Bunko copy (Y≈çmei Bunko-bon), the Kasuga copy (Kasuga-bon/Kuwana-bon), the Tokyo National Museum copy (T≈çky≈ç Kokuritsu Hakubutsukan-bon) no. 1, the National Diet Library copy (Kokuritsu Kokkai Toshokan-bon), and the Tokyo National Museum copy no. 2 (3). The original work is of extremely high quality and is kept by the Imperial household. English Translation Royall Tyler has completed a study and complete English translation of Kasuga Gongen genki e, under the title ‚ÄúThe Miracles of the Kasuga Deity‚Äù, which was published in 1990. Within his translation, Royall Tyler refers to Kasuga Gongen genki as ‚Äúthe Genki‚Äù. The first part of the book gives background information on the Kasuga shrine, K≈çfukuji, the Kasuga cult and the religious background and context in which the original work was created. The second part of the book gives a complete translation of all 20 scrolls, with annotations to assist the reader in understanding the work.

It varies in colour from light to dark rusty ginger. Used as a building stone it can be found in Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and extensively in the historic buildings of north-west Norfolk.University of Southampton Archaeology, Stone in Archaeology Database.Messent, C. W. J, Rev. 1967, A Thousand Years of Norfolk Carstone 967‚Äì1967, Fletcher & Sons. Carrstone can vary in quality depending on factors such as the degree of iron oxide present, and sufficient pressure to form the matrix. Carrstone can also phase into puddingstone, Ferricrete and silver carr. Because of its variations it does not lend itself to carving or finer work.Clifton-Taylor A., & Simmons, J. 1987. The Pattern of English Building Carrstonework can be seen in forms such as: random carrstone, coursed carrstone, ashlared carrstone, all with, or without, galleting. Other patterns of use are: rough carrstone sipps (slips or brickettes) and cut carrstone sipps, both used in masonry fields between brickwork quoins.Hart, Stephen. 2008, Flint Flushwork, a Medieval Masonry Art, p. 25, Boyden Press. Carrstone used in construction Cut carrstone sipps are used extensively at Sandringham House on the main building and the stables block. Other examples of carrstone work can be found on St Mary's Church, Barton Bendish as well as many other parish churches in the region.Allen, R. L, 2004, Carrstone in Norfolk Buildings, Archaeopress. Hunstanton and Wolferton feature some interesting examples along with the 'Gingerbread Town' of Downham Market, notably the Grade II listed Downham Market railway station. Due to easy access to river transport, Carrstone can occasionally be found outside this region in such places as Great Bentley Church, Colchester Essex. Carrstone in the cliffs at Hunstanton  Petrography of carrstone formation  Ferruginous sandstone with detritial framework grains. Quartz dominated with subordinate feldspar, glauconite and sporadic phosphatic grains. retrieved 15-3-2011  Silver carr  Silver carrstone is, by comparison to ginger carrstone, rare. It is quarried alongside ginger and some even rarer pieces display both colours. The stone is a concretion which was generally quarried at Castle Rising woods, Norfolk. Many of the buildings in Castle Rising, Hillington and Flitcham have examples of silver carr used as a building material. Due to the proximity of the river, the stone was transported to other locations such as Burgh Castle, Norfolk. Silver carrstone alongside ginger carrstone  Carrstone iron ore  East Anglia has had only four workable pockets for iron production. The Carrstone found in Norfolk at Ashwicken and West Runton was considered viable for iron smelting by the Romans.Tylecote, R. F., 1986, The Prehistory of Metallurgy in the British Isles, Institute of Metals, London. There is also evidence of smelting carrstone in the 14th century at Blakeney Chapel.

Whilst the stone is used as a single leaf for newbuild to reflect the more vernacular buildings, it is more common to see traditional methods of construction which involve an inner and outer leaf with a rubble core fill. This type of wall is referred to as 'solid wall construction', but this is a misleading description due to the two leaves and core fill having different properties from a true solid wall, which is more susceptible to condensation and other damp mechanisms such as penetrating and rising damp.

It was held that because the claims were vested in the company before the company went into liquidation, the proceeds of such a claim would be caught by a floating charge where the floating charge was expressed to include any after-acquired property. Facts An official receiver was appointed to pursue the former directors of the Anglo-Austrian Printing & Publishing Union for misfeasance, and other funds. It recovered ¬£7000 in damages for misfeasance and ¬£1200 in calls on unpaid shares from former shareholders. However, a group of debenture holders had not yet been paid. They claimed the money recovered was theirs, given that it first went to the company on which they held charges, and could not be used to pay unsecured creditors before the debentures were paid off. Judgment Vaughan Williams J held, reluctantly, that money recovered during liquidation from in proceedings under section 10 of the Companies (Winding-up) Act 1890 and by calls on contributories, belong to debenture holders charging all the undertaking and property of the company, when total assets are not enough.

It was released on October 18, 2010, on the independent record label Rise Above. It was released in North America on January 18, 2011, and in Japan on April 6, 2011. The album was recorded in the band's hometown and produced by Gene Walker. Opus Eponymous was nominated for a Grammis Award. The Japanese release contains an additional bonus track: a cover of the Beatles' \\"Here Comes the Sun\\". The album cover bears a close resemblance to the poster artwork of the 1979 horror miniseries Salem's Lot which is based on the novel of the same name by Stephen King. Background A band member, all of whom are referred to only as Nameless Ghouls, explained that the songs on Opus Eponymous were written in 2007 and 2008, around two years before the album was released. Tobias Forge said that it was the song \\"Stand by Him\\" that heralded the start of the band: \\"while being together in another band, Ghost started when I played a riff to everybody else. I said that this is probably the most heavy metal riff that has ever existed. Then I showed them the opening riff to 'Stand by Him'. When the chorus came to me, it haunted my dreams. Every time I picked up the guitar, I ended up playing that progression, and when I fit the words in, it seemed to cry out for a Satanically-oriented lyric. This was in 2006. When we came up with the name Ghost, it seemed only natural to build on the foundation of this heavy imagery. Within that concept we were able to combine our love of horror films, and of course, the traditions of Scandinavian metal.\\" The lyrics to \\"Stand by Him\\" were originally in Swedish. Forge contacted his former Repugnant bandmate Gustaf Lindstr√∂m and recorded demos of \\"Stand by Him\\", \\"Prime Mover\\" and \\"Death Knell\\" in early 2008. It was the songs that caused Ghost to become a theatrical band with their Satanic theme: \\"Very early on, when the material came together in the project phase before it was actually a band, when it was a logo and a couple of songs, it came together by itself because the material and the lyrics sort of screamed a over-the-top commitment to the dark side. It is hard to make that credible and really eerie. What we thought of when we heard the songs is basically a band that looks the way we do now\\", explained a Ghoul. Although he sang on the demos, Forge did not want to be the singer, preferring to be the guitarist. He approached several vocalists for the role, including Messiah Marcolin, Mats Lev√©n, Christer G√∂ransson of Mindless Sinner, and JB Christoffersson. All of these singers turned down the offer, leading Forge to take the position himself. Forge uploaded the demos to Myspace on 12 March 2010. The musician later stated \\"that night, my whole life changed;\\" within two days of posting the demos, he was contacted by record labels from around the world. In an unfortunate coincidence, Forge's older brother Sebastian died the same day the demos were released . =Recording= Ghost performing at Roskilde Festival 2011 Opus Eponymous was recorded over the course of a few weeks in a basement studio in the band's hometown of Link√∂ping. It was mixed and mastered by Jaime Gomez Arellano (Ulver, Angel Witch) at Orgone Mastering in London. One Nameless Ghoul said \\"We did the whole thing with a standard Gibson SG\\", and explained they were limited as opposed to their second album, \\"which is why a lot of the guitars sound more traditionally metal.\\" Another stated \\"We played everything through an Orange Thunderverb 50. To get a real Seventies vibe, we backed up the gain as much as possible without losing the tone or the sustain. We found that the midrange was really important as well. That's why we used Orange amps.\\" Tobias Forge stated that the album was recorded with a session drummer and nothing else. The song \\"Elizabeth\\" is about Elizabeth B√°thory. The tracks \\"Con Clavi Con Dio\\" and \\"Genesis\\" are sped up waltzes. Describing why they covered \\"Here Comes the Sun\\", a Ghoul said \\"I've been a fan of Beatles even longer than I've been listening to hard rock, so it made a lot of sense.\\" He explained that the band selects songs to cover based on if they can adapt it into their own: \\"We sort of found the angle of taking that so and inverting it. And that's something that's sort of the Ghost recipe for doing covers, it has to be a song that has some sort of tongue-in-cheek inversion quality to it. And that song just screamed 'cover'.\\" The theme of Opus Eponymous ties in with the band's second album, Infestissumam: \\"Everything on the first record was about a coming darkness, an impending doom. Whereas the new record is about something present, and literally, the new record deals with the presence of the Anti-Christ, the Devil.\\" The first album ended with \\"Genesis\\", the birth of the Antichrist, and Infestissumam continues from the Antichrist's birth onward. Reception Opus Eponymous entered the Sverigetopplistan Albums Top 60 chart at No. 59, staying on the charts for 5 weeks and peaking at No. 50. The album was nominated for the 2011 Grammis Award (the Swedish equivalent to the Grammy Awards) in the \\"Best Hard Rock\\" category. In the June 2011 edition of Sweden Rock Magazine it was named the third best album in the past decade, with the first two being The Final Frontier and A Matter of Life and Death by Iron Maiden. The album's cover was declared the fourth best of 2010 by Revolver magazine. Noisecreep listed Ghost's version of \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" at number six on their list of the 10 Best Metal Cover Songs. In their roundup of the 25 Best Metal Albums of 2010-2019, the music blog MetalSucks declared Opus Eponymous to be the 5th best metal album of the '10s. In 2015, Benjamin Hedge Olson of PopMatters called Opus Eponymous a 21st-century classic: \\"The production oozed spot-on early-'80s atmosphere, the lyrics were blatantly Satanic without being silly, and whomever Nameless Ghoul wrote those tracks was a master of hooks and melody.\\" Track listing All original songs credited to \\"A Ghoul Writer\\" in the booklet; actual writing credits adapted from ASCAP.

When it concluded its mission in summer 2011, the formation included a Canadian Forces battle group, three U.S. Army battalions (two of infantry and one of military police), an engineer regiment, a signal squadron, Operational Mentor and Liaison Teams (OMLTs), and contributions to Operational Mentor and Advisory Teams (OMATs) and the Police Operational Mentor and Liaison Team (P-OMLT).  Origin  = Move from Kabul = On 29 November 2005, the Canadian base Camp Julien in southwest Kabul officially closed. Canadian Forces (CF) components that were in Kabul under Operation Athena were relocated to Kandahar as part of the U.S.-led campaign against terrorism known as Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF). The Canadian component was initially designated Operation Archer. The Canadian Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT) had already been at Camp Nathan Smith in Kandahar since August 2005. The PRT integrated elements from the Canadian Forces (CF), Foreign Affairs Canada (FAC), the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP). = Task Force Afghanistan = In early 2006, Canada's contribution to Operation Archer increased to approximately 2300 personnel. The then-designated Task Force Afghanistan also included a Canadian-led multinational brigade headquarters, designated Task Force Aegis, and Canadian battle group designated Task Force Orion centred on 1st Battalion Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry (1 PPCLI). This time frame also saw the introduction of the M777 howitzer as part of the task force in February 2006. The period was highlighted by Operation Mountain Thrust and Operation Zahara (also designated the First Battle of Panjwaii). 1 PPCLI was given the Commander-in-Chief Unit Commendation from the Governor-General of Canada for \\"exceptional determination and courage during relentless combat in Afghanistan, from January to August 2006\\". On 31 July 2006, with the expansion of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) mandate, US-led Coalition forces handed command of the southern region of Afghanistan to Regional Command South. With the transfer of command authority, the majority of Canadian Forces in Afghanistan came again under Operation Athena.  Evolution of Task Force Kandahar  = Task Force 3-06 (Operation Athena Rotation 2) = On 19 August 2006, the 1st Battalion The Royal Canadian Regiment Battle Group (1RCR BG) assumed command of the Kandahar Province area of operations from Task Force Orion. In early September 2006 the task force lead Operation Medusa with the aim to clear Taliban insurgents from a fortified position in Pashmul. For the operation, the battle group was partnered with forces from the United States, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Denmark and Afghanistan. The Battle of Pashmul marked the first time NATO had engaged in combat operations at the battle group-level. In the citation for the Commander-in-Chief Unit Commendation, the battle group had succeeded \\"where larger forces had failed, they prevented the enemy from realizing their goals of capturing the city and weakening international resolve and cohesion\\". An Operational Mentor and Liaison Team (OMLT) was formed to work with the 1st Brigade of the 205 Atul (Hero) Corps (1/250 Corps), based in Kandahar Province. This surge, along with the deployment of a squadron of Leopard 1 tanks from Lord Strathcona's Horse (Royal Canadians), CFB Edmonton, increased the number Canadian Forces in Afghanistan to 2500. With Brigadier-General Timothy Grant assuming command of the Canadian elements in Kandahar in November 2006 and the construction of Provincial Operations Centre at Kandahar Airfield, the framework for Joint Task Force Afghanistan (JTF-Afg) was in place. = Task Force 1-07 (Operation Athena Rotation 3) = Although the battle group for TF 1-07 was based on 2nd Battalion The Royal Canadian Regiment (2RCR) from CFB Gagetown, the headquarters for Task Force Kandahar was primarily force generated from Land Force Atlantic Area, taking on a greater responsibility than previously rotations' Nation Command Elements. The commander for Task Force Kandahar was also designated Commander Joint Task Force Afghanistan, ultimately responsible for all Canadian Forces personnel and assets deployed in southwest Asia. The task force contributed to Operation Achilles mid-April to mid-March 2007, the clearing of Taliban fighters from Helmand Province. This offensive action was the largest NATO operation in Afghanistan up to this point. On 15 May 2007, the Canadian OMLT took over full responsibility for the mentoring of 1/250 Corps from the United States Army. In July 2007, the Government of Canada increased its diplomatic presence in Kandahar by appointing Michel de Salaberry as the Representative of Canada Kandahar (RoCK). = Task Force 3-07 (Operation Athena Rotation 4) = Both the headquarters and the battle group were generated from 5 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group (5 CMBG) with Brigadier-General Guy Laroche as the commander. This rotation of the headquarters saw the \\"digitizing\\" of the task force, modernizing the command and control information systems within the task force and the standing up of Task Force Kandahar Signal Squadron. The 3rd Battalion Royal 22e R√©giment Battle Group (3 R22eR BG), which was awarded the Commander-in-Chief Unit Commendation, was \\"instrumental in dismantling improvised explosive device networks, re-capturing checkpoints and returning them to Afghan control, enhancing the capacity of Afghan forces and providing guidance on community building and local governance.\\" On 16 October 2007, the Government of Canada indicated the current mission was to end in 2011. = Task Force 1-08 (Operation Athena Rotation 5) = * Battle group ‚Äì 2nd Battalion Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry Battle Group * Provincial Reconstruction Team ‚Äì B Company, 1st Battalion, Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry * Task Force Kandahar ‚Äì Rotation 4 Task Force Kandahar headquarters remained (9-month tour) * Dates ‚Äì February 2008 ‚Äì September 2008 = Task Force 5-08 = Based on headquarters from 2 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group, TF 5-08 was also part of Operation Athena Rotation 5, but as the headquarters were on nine-month tours instead of the standard six, the headquarters were no longer in sync with their respective rotation. The headquarters, although it was involved with force-generation exercises with both Rotation 5 and 6, the Commander, Brigadier-General Denis Thompson, referred to the headquarters as \\"Rotation 5.5\\".

He was the last general to head the Imperial Army of Iran. He is regarded as one of the most powerful and adept military generals in Iran's modern history.Mansur Rafizadeh. \\"Witness: From the Shah to the Secret Arms Deal : an Insider's Account of U.S. Involvement in Iran\\". W. Morrow, (1987).Mark J. Roberts. \\"Khomeini's Incorporation of the Iranian Military\\". (January, 1996). Early life Oveissi's family from his father's lineage goes back to Shah Qara Yusuf Muhammad, the ruler of the Ghara Ghoyonlu dynasty (Black Seep Turkomans) and descends through Uzun Hassan when he defeated Jahan Shah in a battle near the sanjak of √áapak√ßur in present-day eastern Turkey on 30 October (or 11 November), 1467, resulting in a merger of the Ghara Ghoyonlu and the Agh Ghoyunlu dynasty (White Sheep Turkomans). He is a direct descendant of Eskandar Beik Torkaman, the minister, head of army (Iraq campaign) and personal advisor to Shah Abbas the Great. On his mother's side he was the grandson of Hossein Ali Mirza, the eldest son of Mohammad Ali Shah Qajar. In 1937, Oveissi married Sharafat Baniadam, the daughter of Sharif Doleh Baniadam, and granddaughter of Sharif Doleh Bozorg. They were married until her passing in 1972. The Baniadams were members of the Ghaffari family of Kashan. Career Oveissi received his diploma from Iran's Military High School. He attended the Officers Faculty in the same class as Mohammad Reza Pahlavi continuing his military training in the Military Academy in Tehran where he graduated first in his class. The top graduates of the class were selected by Reza Shah to go straight to the Imperial Guard, an honor given only to the top five graduates. Oveissi sought permission from Reza Shah to be stationed at Khuzestan instead where the government was involved in battle with rebel groups. He attended the Military organization in Fort Myers, Virginia and Fort Leavenworth (Kansas) in 1959.\\"US Embassy and Constructive Criticism of Gholam Ali Oveissi\\".

After 1955 his military career progressed rapidly. * On 12 September 1954, he became a full colonel and served with that rank until 1960 when he was promoted to general in the Imperial Iranian Army. * From 1958‚Äì1960 he participated actively in the military court prosecution of communist officers. * He continued his military studies in the United States periodically from 1960‚Äì1965, and became a full commander of the Royal Military division of the Imperial Guards.Ibid. Four Star General of the Army. From 1960‚Äì1965 Oveissi became a four star general of the Army, being the youngest of his peers to achieve the rank of four stars. * In 1965 General Oveissi became the Chief Commander of the security divisions of the Policy Academy. * In 1966 he served in the Committee of Information of the Imperial Iranian Army. * In 1969 he obtained the highest military rank. Medals General Oveissi received many military medals for his honorable and distinguished services in the Iranian Armed Forces, including: 1) Medals 1,2 and 3 for his aptitude; 2) Medal of Honor 1,2 and 3; 3) He was honored with a medal (level 2) for his exceptional effort in the counter coup d'√©tat of 1953 (28 Mordad). 4) He received a medal for being a master marksman; 4) He received the medal of (Taj) crown level 3 Medal of Homayoun level 3; 5) Medal of appreciation and acknowledgement levels 1,2, and; 6) Medal for his tireless efforts and highly praised work levels 1,2, and 3; 7) Medal for his services level 3; 8) Medal for his distinguished education. Oveissi additionally obtained medals from various countries' military organizations. He received medals from Italian, English, Lebanese, German, and Ethiopian militaries as well. Later years and assassination In January 1979, Oveissi was pressured to resign and leave the country. He settled in France just before the Iranian revolution on 11 February. In the immediate aftermath of the revolution, Ayatollah Sadegh Khalkhali, a religious judge and then chairman of the Revolutionary Court, informed the press that the death sentence was passed on the members of the Pahlavi family and former Shah officials, including Oveissi. Oveissi was shot dead, along with his brother, Gholam Hossein, on 7 February 1984 in Paris, Rue de Passy. Oveissi was at the age of 66. The Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility for the assassination. His death was considered by many as the blow that dealt the most setback to opposition groups poised to overthrow the revolutionary regime in Tehran. Two days before his assassination he was expected to fly back to the border of Iran to lead a counter revolutionary army of officers and men from elite divisions of the late Shah's military that was quartered in 22 makeshift barracks in eight Turkish villages and at five clandestine bases inside Iran. Since Oveissi had strong ties and the support of powerful members of the clergy including Grand Ayatollahs Shariatmadari and Abu al-Qasim al-Khoei his elimination was priority number one for the newly established revolutionary government.

It is about a 13-year-old boy named Samuel living during the Revolutionary War whose house is burnt down by British soldiers while he is out hunting. When Samuel investigates the scene of devastation, he finds the dead bodies of his neighbors, but none of the bodies were his parents. His parents were not killed because one of the British officers saw that Samuel's father played chess, and the officer wanted to play chess with him. Samuel starts a journey to find his parents by tracking them all the way to New York. He meets a man named Old Bob that the Indians didn't kill. Old Bob tells him that the British came by there and destroyed his home but left him because they believed that he was crazy. So, Samuel continues his journey, now with a renewed hope that he will find them, but he gets hit in the head with a tomahawk thrown by an Indian who was guarding his parents and the other prisoners. But with the help of rebels his wound healed. He visits a calm farm and meets a young girl named Annie, who introduces him to her parents. They have dinner together and are very nice to Samuel. Samuel starts to leave, but goes back because he sees Hessians heading in the direction of the farm. The Hessians shoot and kill Annie's parents, but Annie is too quick for them and runs away. Samuel goes after her and they venture together to continue the search for Samuel's parents. Samuel finds the help of a man named Abner, and his friend Matthew, who are spies and work together and agree to help him. Samuel and Abner sneak into New York and escape with Samuel's parents, but his father is weak. Samuel's family then adopts Annie as their own daughter. The family continues to escape after Abner tells them that he has to leave them. They run into a group of British soldiers and Samuel kills one officer and was almost killed by the rest, but some rebel gunfire saved him and his family. The rebels take Samuel and his family back to Philadelphia for safety. Samuel then decided to go to war but returned to where his original home was before he left. He joined the continental army and stayed there for three years until one of his friends, who saved him from the tomahawk injury, died.

The company was established in December 1918, and started a catering service in 1919. Originally owned by the Norwegian Trunk Railway, it was acquired by the state in 1926. Meals served in the restaurant carriages were relatively expensive, although they were available to all passengers. In the 1950s, the company began using serving trolleys on trains. In January 1975, NSS merged with the convenience-store chain Narvesen Kioskkompani into a new company called Narvesen‚ÄìSpisevognselskapet. This enterprise was partly owned by the Norwegian State Railways (NSB) and Fritt Ord, before it merged with the Reitan Group and was delisted from the Oslo Stock Exchange. Background Restaurant carriage on a alt=restaurant carriage, with tables set for dinner From the 1854 establishment of railways in Norway to 1909, no dining service was offered aboard trains; passengers were allowed to bring food with them. Train stations also lacked dining facilities. The first dining service was started by restaurateur Carl Christiansen. He established the restaurant at Drammen Station, and in 1907 was asked by NSB to establish a dining service aboard the express trains on the Bergen Line, which would open in 1909. After investigating similar operations in England and Germany, he ordered two carriages from Skabo Jernbanevognfabrikk. These were to be paid for by the state, but the Parliament of Norway delayed the grants after a long debate regarding the suitability of restaurant carriages on trains. The plans were opposed by the teetotaler faction of Parliament, but there was a majority in favor of dining service. To get the carriages in time, Christiansen personally guaranteed the production cost in case a state grant was not allocated. After the parliamentary decision, the cost of the carriages was refunded by NSB. In 1910, when President of the United States Theodore Roosevelt visited Oslo to receive the Nobel Peace Prize, several restaurant carriages were ordered solely for the occasion. Two years later, restaurant carriages were put in regular service on the √òstfold Line. Early days Norsk Spisevognselskap restaurant carriage at alt=Outside of restaurant carriage, 1935 In 1916, the executive board of the state railways sought to consolidate the operation of restaurant carriages and the most important station restaurants in Norway into one management. The board stated that they wanted to minimise the conflict of interest between the railway company and the dining-car operator. They also saw centralising operations as a way to allocate a larger share of the revenue to the railway company, and to ensure a high quality of service on new lines. At that time the S√∏rland Line and Dovre Line were in the planning stages, and the NSB intended to introduce dining services on these upon completion. Oslo East Station and its restaurant were operated by the private Norwegian Trunk Railway. In an agreement signed on 18 September 1918 both railway companies agreed that a new restaurant operator should be controlled by the Norwegian Trunk Railway, although this company had to abide by the NSB's restrictions on restaurant carriages operating on any line. This model was inspired by a similar solution in Sweden, where a separate dining company had been established; this company paid the railway company part of its revenue and a fixed fee per restaurant carriage. The Swedish model included the operation of station restaurants at locations where the restaurant carriages would have depots. On 21 December 1918, A.S Norsk Spisevognselskap was established with a share capital of 200,000 Norwegian krone (NOK). It had 20 shares; 17 were owned by the Trunk Railway, and one by each of three directors: Waldemar Stoud Platou, Gotfred Furuholmen and Christian Emil Stoud Platou‚Äîthe former represented the Trunk Railway and the latter was director-general of the NSB. In January 1919, Waldemar Platou was appointed chair and Christiansen managing director. The company took over Christiansen's four restaurant carriages and the restaurant at Oslo √ò on 1 April 1919. On 2 February 1926, Parliament voted to nationalise the Trunk Railway. During the debate, the organisation of Spisevognselskapet was criticised; with the nationalisation, the state became the sole owner of Spisevognselskapet. On 31 March 1927, the Ministry of Labour advised that the company remain a state-owned limited company; the minority in parliament wanted a state enterprise. In the 1930s, Sigurd Astrup was managing director of Norsk Spisevognselskap. In 1948, Erling Mossige was appointed the same position, and was in turn succeeded by Knut Tvedt in 1960. The company had 75 employees in 1919, and 591 in 1949. Restaurant carriages Trolley service in 1964 on the Bergen Line The restaurant carriages of the NSS were open to everyone, but dining was so expensive that usually only passengers travelling in first class used the service. Usually, three or four dishes were offered in the restaurant carriages. A four-course dinner cost five Norwegian kroner in the 1920s, which was expensive at the time. Warm dishes, such as soups and sauces, were usually prepared at a small stove in the restaurant carriage's kitchen. On busy days, prepared steaks were delivered from rail depots. Otherwise, the menu consisted largely of fish options, such as halibut, flatfish, cod and even whale sausages. The kitchens were staffed by two maids and one attendant. Blocks of ice were often used instead of refrigerators. With the opening of the Dovre Line, Spisevognselskapet established dining-car service on 25 June 1921. In 1921 a train ride from Kristiania to Trondheim lasted approximately 15 hours, and the average waiting time at each station was between 10 and 15 minutes. On 1 July 1925 dining service was introduced on the Valdres Line, from 1 July 1926 on the Brevik Line, from May 1934 on the Nordland Line and from 15 May 1936 on the R√∏ros Line. In 1948 210,000 meals were served on board, in addition to sandwiches and drinks. The company also offered a light breakfast on night trains on the Kongsvinger, √òstfold and Dovre lines. During the Second World War, dining-car service was discontinued. After the war trains faced competition from aviation and automobiles, and serving trolleys were installed on Norwegian trains. In 1965 cart service on trains was centralised and standardised; food service was faster, and prices were lowered. In the 1970s cafeteria cars were used, where passengers could serve themselves. Restaurants Restaurant at alt=Large, high-ceilinged restaurant in Bjorli Station NSS derived most of its revenue from the operation of restaurants at railway stations; in 1939, this amounted to 80%. Initially, the company operated the restaurant at Oslo √ò; from 1921, it also took over operation of the restaurants at Oslo West Station, Hamar, Koppang, Opdal and Elverum. The following year, four more restaurants were added: St√∏ren, Myrdal, Dokka and Hell. NSS also established its first kiosk, at Bergen Station. In 1923, the company was allowed to take over all restaurants in the railway districts of Oslo and Hamar; by 1925, it had taken over operation of the restaurants at Lillehammer, H√∏nefoss, Jessheim, Kornsj√∏, Halden, Ski, Eidsvoll, Otta, Domb√•s, √Öndalsnes, Kongsvinger, Trondheim, Rena, Roa, Ringebu, Bjorli and Finse. After this NSS decided not to obtain many additional restaurants, as it did not see value in such a strategy. From 1930 through 1934 the company took over restaurants at √Öl, Jaren, Lillestr√∏m and T√∏nsberg, along with dining service on the steamship Skibladner, which ran on Mj√∏sa. During the first half of the 1940s it again acquired new restaurants, including the one at Kristiansand Station. In 1940 and 1941 the company made a solid profit, but lack of food from 1942 onwards transformed the profit to a loss. During the late 1940s NSS also took over the restaurants at Drammen and Sarpsborg, as well as the one at Oslo Airport, Fornebu. Hotels Hotel at alt=Square, three-story hotel in winter In 1919 the Norwegian Trunk Railway operated one hotel, which was built as part of Eidsvoll Station. Operation of the 20-room hotel was taken over by Spisevognselskapet on 14 October 1924. NSB was at the time building the Dovre Line between Oslo and Trondheim, and was considering establishing hotels where the line passed through Dovrefjell. Both Hjerkinn and Fokkstua were considered, but these areas were served by other operators. Instead, Spisevognselskapet established the Oppdal Tourist Hotel adjacent to Oppdal Station and it opened on 28 June 1924. The 60-bed hotel had a floor area of and was marketed as a tourist destination, with bobsleigh and curling during the winter and tennis and croquet in summer. The hotel was closed for part of 1929, because the municipality would not allow it to serve alcoholic beverages. In Oslo, the company had its offices and workings spread around town. The main depot was at the East Station; the head office was at Fred. Olsens gate 21 from 1919 to 1921, at Kongens gate 29 until 1932, and at Tollbodgaten 24 until 1938. Management wanted to centralise both a new depot and administrative offices at a single location close to the railway station, preferably co-located with a hotel. In 1936 work began on a hotel at Jernbanetorget, but the project was cancelled. The proposed hotel would have had 100 rooms across the street from Oslo √ò. However, the plans were blocked by Parliament (which was opposed to the state railway operating hotels). Instead, the administration moved into Nylandsveien 10, in a new building built on a lot owned by NSB. In Bergen the company established Hotel Terminus Bergen along with other investors, but the hotel failed to make money. In the late 1940s the company bought Grand Hotell Bellevue in √Ölesund, and later operated Saltfjellet Tourist Hotel for a short period. In 1952, Oslo Municipality's Viking Hotel was completed, and Spisevognselskapet was selected as the operator. It remained the hotel's operator until 1976 when the government sold it to Eiendomsinvest, which outbid Spisevognselskapet by several million kroner. Dissolution Narvesen had an exclusive agreement with NSB to operate newsagent's shops at all railway stations, except in stations with restaurants, which were operated by Spisevognselskapet. Narvesen had a near-monopoly on newsagents in Norway, and rented facilities in many public places. The owners of Narvesen intended to create a foundation to obtain the company; when plans for this started in 1972, they had difficulties finding a way to transfer shares to the foundation without having to pay tax on the transaction. However, the tax laws permitted a tax-free transaction if it was part of a restructuring. A merger with Spisevognselskapet would be considered a restructuring, and in 1974 Fritt Ord was established to take over Narvesen's owners' share of the company. The agreement between Narvesen and NSB was made in July 1974; in December it was passed by Parliament, although the Conservative Party and Progress Party voted against the merger. A.S Narvesen‚ÄìSpisevognselskapet was established on 1 January 1975. Fritt Ord owned 50% of the new company and NSB 41%. It assumed the Narvesen name in 1979. By the late 1980s, the company had sold all its hotel operations. The merged company retained the obligation to operate dining services on the trains, which put them in need of considerable subsidies from NSB. In 1988, NSB decided to organize the operation of the dining services through tendered contracts; the first contract (from 1990 through 1995) was won by TogService, a Narvesen subsidiary. The owners had an agreement that neither could sell without the approval of the other. In 1995 NSB sold its shares with Fritt Ord's approval, and the company was listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange. In 1999, Fritt Ord reduced its stock share in Narvesen from 51% to 34%. In the fall of 2000, Fritt Ord accepted a proposal to merge Narvesen with the Reitan Group. The merged company was named ReitanNarvesen; Fritt Ord held 16.2% of its shares. In November 2001 Fritt Ord sold its shares of ReitanNarvesen, which was renamed Reitan Handel and delisted from the Oslo Stock Exchange.

The Coliseum was officially closed on September 1, 2002 by Mayor John DeStefano, Jr., and demolished on January 20, 2007. Background Hanley made the decision to film the documentary of the New Haven Coliseum back in 2005 when it was announced the massive exposed steel building would be demolished, because of the structure being a Connecticut cultural icon. The film took five years to complete. Featuring interviews with Coliseum architect Kevin Roche, World Wrestling Entertainment hall-of-fame ring announcer Howard Finkel and concert promoter Jim Koplik, the documentary reveals how the Coliseum rose amid the cultural upheavals of the 1960s but settled in as the home office for baby boomers in the 1970s and 1980s. The film premiered on November 8, 2010, on Connecticut Public Television (CPTV) and has subsequently been re-broadcast several times, as well as being screened locally. The film was shot entirely in high-definition. A 120 minute extended cut of the film is available on DVD.

There are several oil paintings by Fielding in the Peterborough Museum and Art Gallery, including a panoramic view of Stamford, Lincolnshire, entitled Hay Harvest at Stamford painted in about 1780 and a view of the Market Square in Peterborough. Fielding had five sons, all artists, including Theodore Henry Adolphus, Antony Vandyke Copley, Thales, and Newton Smith Fielding.

Like his brothers Copley and Thales he painted in watercolours, and in 1799 sent to the Royal Academy A View of the North Tyne, near Billingham, Northumberland. In 1814 he sent to the British Institution A Sleeping Bacchus. He continued to exhibit at both exhibitions, but it is sometimes difficult to distinguish his works from those of his younger brother, Thales Fielding. In 1826 he was appointed teacher of drawing and perspective at the East India Company's Military Seminary at Addiscombe.

His sons were Charles Edward Stuart (\\"The Young Pretender\\") and Henry Benedict Stuart (who, after his elder brother's death in 1788, never asserted a claim to the throne). Provisions Section 1 enacted that after 1 May 1744 it was treason for anyone to \\"hold, entertain, or keep any intelligence or correspondence in person, or by letters, messages or otherwise\\" with any son of the Old Pretender, or any of his employees, \\"knowing such person to be so employed,\\" or to give them money, whether in Great Britain or elsewhere. Section 2 provided that from the same date, any son of the Old Pretender who landed or attempted to land in Great Britain or Ireland, \\"or any of the dominions or territories belonging to the crown of Great Britain,\\" or who was found there or in any ship with intent to land there, would be guilty of treason. Section 3 amended section X of the Treason Act 1708. This section had originally provided that after the death of the Old Pretender, \\"no attainder for treason shall extend to the disinheriting of any heir, nor to the prejudice of the right or title of any person or persons, other than the right or title of the offender or offenders, during his, her, or their natural lives, only...\\" (See corruption of blood.) The 1743 Act postponed the operation of this clause until after the death of all of the Old Pretender's sons (which occurred in 1807), instead of his own death (in 1766). (The 1708 and 1743 Acts were amended in turn by the 1799 Act 39 Geo.3 c.93, which repealed these provisions.)

Early life Raphael was born on 10 August 1960 in East Bergholt, Suffolk ‚Äì in the same birthplace village as John Constable, the renowned landscape painter, who was born in 1776. Her father is Frederic Raphael -- screenwriter, novelist and journalist. Sarah was educated at Bedales School (Steep, Hampshire), and subsequently studied art at Camberwell School of Art, London, 1978 ‚Äì 81, graduating with a First Class Honours Degree. Career Raphael worked in several media and in both figurative and abstract styles. As a portrait painter she gained recognition at the highest level and is featured on The National Portrait Gallery's website. Charles Saumarez Smith, director of the National Portrait Gallery, called her \\"one of the finest figurative artists of the generation\\". She was an accomplished, assured draftsman. A survey of her work is provided by the book, Sarah Raphael Drawings, published by Carcanet Press Ltd, October 2004. As William Boyd has written of her figurative works, \\"You can tell how good they are yourself: you don't need the imprimatur of a gallery or a dealer or a patron.\\" Initially notable for her portraits, Raphael's paintings became progressively more abstract, especially evident through the series: Desert Paintings (mid-90s), STRIP! (1997) and Time Travel for Beginners (2000). Of particular note of her prints (etchings and monotypes) are the Small Objects works, which relate to the STRIP! paintings. She illustrated books written by her father, Frederic, The Hidden I: A Myth Revisited in 1990 and Of Gods and Men in 1992. She has works hanging in the Metropolitan Museum in New York and in several large corporate collections as well as London's National Portrait Gallery.

Technique This technique described in 1839 in France, in Paris, exposes a set of methods and of processes to produce tapestries and tissues. It includes the following techniques: * The printing in black and in color on paper, pattern and tissues, * The preparation of colors and materials necessary for the draftsmen, for the colourers and the manufacturers of carpet and tapestries, classified according to a chromatic table, * A manufacturing process of point, innovative in 1839, * The art to make industrially tapestries comparable to the best tapestries in that time.  Definitions  Chromagraphie: art to compose a model by means of lines and of geometrical figures, and to imitate it with colored materials. Rouget de Lisle described its process of composition and printing of works in color on paper, pattern and tissues as allowing to save 50% of time with regard to a manual realization.  Etymology  The word chromagraphy comes from ancient Greek Khr√¥ma which means \\"color\\" and Graphein who means \\"writing\\". This etymology is comparable to that of the scientific term \\"chromatography\\", appeared only in 1908 and which must not be confused with the chromagraphy of Rouget de Lisle.  History  The intention of Rouget de Lisle was to create \\"a funny and lucrative activity to the ladies and to the artists colourers ‚Äúby developing the work of the color‚Äù by the composition of tasteful models which make them love and look for\\" and by propagating \\"the feeling and the love of the beautiful.\\" He began to gather and to classify the knowledge of the painters and the manufacturers of tapestries to realize their works of a \\"pleasant, economic and complete\\" way. These works ending in the chromagraphy benefited from the support of big names of the domain in the time, among which the administrator of the royal factory of Tapestries (Manufacture des Gobelins), Mr Lavocat, the director of the dyes of the royal factories, Mr Chevreul, the foreman of the royal factory of tapestries, Mr Deyrolles, with his son, painter of the models of carpet. Rouget de Lisle was himself a pupil of Mr Chevreul.  Principle  The general principle is to simplify the complete chain leading from a work to its reproduction on another support, as the carpet or the tissue. Rouget de Lisle attempts to refocus the work of the various workers on tasks with values added, as well for the persons as for their productions. He brings a particular attention to the quality throughout the process, in particular on the management of colors and their exact reproductions. He exposes \\" the law of the simultaneous contrast \\" and the \\"chromatic Table\\" allowing to end in quality printings. He so obtains 200 tints all in all. These 200 tones are codified by a language allowing their fast reproductions during the preparation of tapestries. The drawing of the work to be reproduced completed by the symbols of tints of every points constitutes the chromagraphy. This system reminds the modern description of a computer file of Bitmap type or GIF 8 bits. Rouget de Lisle also integrates signs for the various types of points to be realized.  Example  Example of Chromagraphy by Rouget de Lisle : (to be done) One of the tables of signs symbolizing tints: (to be done) One of the tables of tones according to the rules of the simultaneous constrate exposed(explained) by Rouget de Lisle in his work on the chromagraphie: (to be done)  Notes and references  All the extracts and examples of Rouget de Lisle result from a reproduction of its work published in 1839, on Chromagraphy (see the external references). The chromagraphy in its spirit and its principle gets closer to digital arts appeared since the end of 20th century computer paintings, prints, drawings, etc.). The chain of digital printing from a file of digital image recall the mechanical production line described by Rouget de Lisle, but in a computer and a modern industrial machine, such as a printer, a weaver, etc.  See also  *Color management *Graphics Interchange Format References  External links  * https://openlibrary.org/books/OL13999978M/Chromagraphie_ou_L%27art_de_composer_un_dessin Industrial Revolution History of Paris History of the textile industry ","title":"Chromagraphy"},{"id":"31172879","text":"Re Oasis Merchandising Services Ltd [1998] Ch 170 is a UK insolvency law and company law case, concerning wrongful trading. Facts The liquidator brought proceedings against 5 individuals, alleged to be directors or shadow directors, amounting to lots. It tried to assign the claims to a specialist litigation company London Wall Claims Ltd, so that in return for the fruits of the litigation, they would bear the cost. The directors being sued claimed that the assignment was unlawful, as it was champertous (i.e. the wrong of getting an uninterested party involved in a lawsuit for money). Robert Walker J allowed the agreement provisionally, but allowed an appeal to the Court of Appeal to answer whether the assignment was champertous or not. London Wall Claims Ltd argued that although the agreement may be champtertous, under the Insolvency Act 1986 Schedule 4, para 6, the liquidator had the power to sell any of the company's property, and that must include the fruits of a wrongful trading action under section 214. Alternatively, the agreement was an act necessary for the course of winding up, and there would be power under the Insolvency Act 1986 Schedule 4, para 13. The directors argued that the section 214 action was not company property. Judgment The Court of Appeal held that the assignment of the claim was not proper. The claim under s 214 is only vested in the liquidator. It arises solely when a company goes into liquidation and it would be champertous and against public policy to assign the fruits of such an action. There is no problem in assigning a s 212 action though. Under Insolvency Act 1986, s 436, company property did not include a section 214 action because there is a difference between assets of a company at the moment of liquidation, and those arising and recoverable only by a liquidator under statutory powers.Distinguishing, Movitor Pty Ltd v Sims (1995) 19 ACSR 440 The agreement the liquidator entered into was an attempt to restrict his conduct of the action. Public policy demanded that it be regarded as champertous and Schedule 4 did not authorise the agreement as being necessary for the winding up of the company's affairs. Peter Gibson LJ noted that: \\"As a matter of policy we think that there is much to be said for allowing a liquidator to sell the fruits of an action for the reasons given ... provided that it does not give the purchaser the right to influence the course of, or to interfere with the liquidator's conduct of, the proceedings.\\"[1998] Ch 170, 186C See also *UK insolvency law *UK company law *Re Yagerphone Ltd [1935] 1 Ch 392 Notes References * External links * United Kingdom insolvency case law Court of Appeal (England and Wales) cases 1996 in case law 1996 in British law ","title":"Re Oasis Merchandising Services Ltd"},{"id":"31172881","text":"Waldemar Jungner Ernst Waldemar Jungner (June 19, 1869 ‚Äì August 30, 1924) was a Swedish inventor and engineer. In 1899 he invented the nickel-iron electric storage battery (NiFe), the nickel-cadmium battery (NiCd) and the rechargeable alkaline silver-cadmium battery (AgCd). As an inventor he also fabricated a fire alarm based on different dilutions of metals. He worked on the electrolytic production of sodium carbonate, and patented a rock drilling device. google books link  Early life  Ernst Waldemar Jungner was born in 1869 in V√§stra G√∂taland County, Sweden. His parents were ministers, and his father died when Waldemar was 13 years old. In 1869, the year he was born, failed harvests caused famine throughout Sweden, which affected Jungner's health. He also contracted measles and scarlet fever.  Education  He attended Skara upper secondary school, and studied chemistry, mathematics, astronomy, botany, geology and Latin at Uppsala University. He went on to carry out further studies at the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) in Stockholm.  Business  In 1900 he started the firm \\"Ackumulator Aktiebolaget Jungner\\". There was a long patent dispute with Edison which was won by Edison in the end because he had larger financial resources. This caused serious problems to Jungner's firm. The company managed to survive by using a slightly different name \\"Nya Ackumulator Aktiebolaget Jungner\\" in 1904. Jungner left the management of the company at this time, but remained a consultant to the new firm. This company was wound up in 1910, and a new company \\"Ackumulator Aktiebolaget Jungner\\" was created, which profitably used new technology developments. A descendant company \\"NiFe Junger\\" in 1991 became part of Saft Groupe S.A..  Battery use  Nickel-cadmium batteries were commonly used in the power systems of rockets and artificial satellites through t the 1960s and 1970s, as well as in terrestrial portable electrical devices. On the rescue mission to Umbreto Nobile and his companions on the North pole expedition in 1928, several batteries were dropped from an airplane to supply electricity to the radio of the expedition. Only the Jungner NiFe battery worked.Hanson SA (1963) Waldemar Jungner and Jungner Ackumulatorn. D√¶dalus, Stockholm, pp 77-99  Later life  Jungner patented designs for a fuel cell in 1907.

In the 1950s, he wrote two major works on communication theory: Communication: The Social Matrix of Psychiatry (1951, with Gregory Bateson), and Nonverbal Communication (1956, with Weldon Kees).https://books.google.com/books/about/Nonverbal_Communication.html?id=KF9hvC3Vm3IC Ruesch, J.; Kees, W., Nonverbal Communication: Notes on the Visual Perception of Human Relations.

The museum displays a varied collection of over 30 American military, propeller, and jet aircraft.  Facility and exhibits  City of Santa Rosa, A-26 Invader attack bomber built in 1944The museum is located about eight miles northwest of downtown Santa Rosa, at the Charles M. Schulz - Sonoma County Airport. Exhibits documenting local aviation history are housed in an original WW II era fabrication shop, along with an aviation reference library, and gift shop featuring aviation themed books, clothing, and toys. F-15 First Responder The museum displays a varied collection of about two dozen military aircraft from World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War, including an A-4 Skyhawk, a Lockheed D-21 drone, an F-16 Fighting Falcon, an F-105 Thunderchief, an F-106A Delta Dart, and a UH-1 Iroquois (\\"Huey\\") helicopter. It also has a kit-built Bede BD-5, the world's lightest jet aircraft; and a hand-built replica of civilian aviation's most famous historic aerobatic airplane, a Pitts Special S1. In December 2010, the museum acquired the historic USAF \\"First Responder\\" F-15 Eagle aircraft. Dispatched from the Otis Air National Guard Base in Massachusetts, it was the first of a dozen fighter planes over New York City and Washington, D.C. on 9/11. The museum plans to fully restore the plane, with a Revolutionary \\"Minuteman\\" emblem stenciled on its tail, and make it the centerpiece of an interactive, educational exhibit.

In the movie, stunt pilot Frank Tallman flies a Beech D-18 full bore, at about 150 knots, through the airplane hangar in less than a second, with only 23 feet of clearance from wingtip to wingtip, and only 15 feet from the top of the tail to the hangar ceiling. Known as the Butler Building, the hangar was built during World War II, and is still in use today. The museum intends to build and move to a new larger facility, still at the airport. One possibility is a location on Airport Boulevard at the main entrance to the county airport, a five-acre garden tilled by inmates at Sonoma County's low-security jail.  Activities  F-14A TomcatThe museum promotes aircraft operational safety, offers classes on aviation history and principles of flight, conducts an aviation summer school and merit badge in aviation program for Boy Scouts, and has an aviation Master Story teller for story time. The museum is very actively involved in community cultural events, supports many civic organizations, and also provides speakers for civic groups.

The IWW experienced a number of divisions and splits during its early history. When the office of the IWW president was abolished at the convention in 1906, deposed President Sherman and his supporters, many from the Socialist Party and the Western Federation of Miners, formed a rump IWW, which ceased to exist after about a year.Paul Frederick Brissenden, The I.W.W. A Study of American Syndicalism, Columbia University, 1919, pages 174-184 After the 1908 convention of the original IWW, at which Socialist Labor Party (SLP) head Daniel DeLeon was barred from voting via credentials challenges, DeLeon and the SLP bolted to form another rump IWW, which came to be called the Detroit IWW. In 1915, the Detroit IWW changed its name to the Workers' International Industrial Union (WIIU). The WIIU continued its close relationship with the SLP, but ceased to exist in 1924. There was another division within the original Chicago IWW which caused political infighting for many years, and finally split the organization in 1924. This time, the two groups were referred to as the centralizers and the decentralizers. This split was in part responsible for a serious decline in membership ‚Äî a decline from which the organization has never fully recovered. The decentralizers' faction ceased to exist as a separate group in 1931. For the existing IWW, the results of the splits were, in part, the abolition of the office of president; the departure of the Socialist Party and the Socialist Labor Party; a constitutional provision barring alliance with any political party; a reliance on direct (economic) action rather than political petition; and a focus on using creative tactics to organize low-wage, itinerant, unskilled, migratory, and immigrant workers.  Eastern Wobblies, western Wobblies  The divisions in the early days of the IWW were based upon differing philosophies and ideologies, and to a considerable extent these differences could be traced to regional particulars. The Western Wobblies were often casual workers from the mines, mills, lumber camps, and agricultural regions of the West and Midwest. These were largely male, unattached, footloose, and open to adventure. In 1918, just after the United States had entered World War I and the government charged IWW leaders with violation of the espionage law for their anti-war expressions, Robert W. Bruere wrote in Harper's Magazine that, > The Industrial Workers of the World are most numerous among the migratory > workers of the West; among the homeless, wayfaring men who follow the > harvests from Texas across the Canadian border; among the lumberjacks who > pack their quilts from camp to distant camp in the fir and pine and spruce > forests of the Northwest; and among the metalliferous miners of Michigan, > Minnesota, Montana, Idaho, Colorado, Arizona, and Old Mexico. In other > words, they are strongest among the men upon whom the nation depends for > three of its basic raw materials‚Äîmaterials of fundamental importance at all > times; of crucial importance in time of war. > According to our best information, approximately four-fifths of these > migratory workers are men whose family ties have been broken‚Äî\\"womanless, > voteless, and jobless men.\\" Competent authorities estimate that about one- > half of them are native Americans, and the other half men who have been > uprooted by labor brokers and padrones from their native ethnic and social > environments; voluntary or forced immigrants from the agricultural districts > of Ireland, from the Welsh and Cornish mines, from the hungry hills of > Italy, Serbia, Greece, and Turkish Asia Minor.Robert W. Bruere, The > Industrial Workers of the World, An Interpretation, Harper's magazine, > Volume 137 Making of America Project Harper & Brothers, 1918 Bruere wrote of a \\"pernicious system of sabotage\\" by railroad corporations and other business interests, creating \\"hobos, vagabonds, wayfarers‚Äîmigratory and intermittent workers, outcasts from society and the industrial machine, ripe for the denationalized fellowship of the I. W. W.\\" Typical IWW tactics in the West were soap boxing and, where they found it necessary, the free speech fight. As a direct result of their working class experiences in western states, Western Wobblies developed a bitter hostility toward political parties.While this hostility toward politics was developed independently, it mirrored the sentiments of syndicalists in France. Paul Frederick Brissenden, The I.W.W. A Study of American Syndicalism, Columbia University, 1919, page 231 The most conspicuous example of these anarchistic sentiments among Western Wobblies was the Overalls Brigade, who were suspicious of all political parties; believed voting and legislating a ritual aimed at deluding workers; were antagonistic toward craft unions, referring to them as coffin societies; and, were generally opposed to leaders of any kind, even within the IWW.Paul Frederick Brissenden, The I.W.W. A Study of American Syndicalism, Columbia University, 1919, page 233 In the East, the IWW became the champion of ethnic solidarity and the focus of immigrant discontent, during a strike of women mill workers in Lawrence, Massachusetts, and elsewhere. One notable struggle in Paterson, New Jersey involved the production of a pageant in Madison Square Garden, performed by the strikers themselves. Many Eastern IWW members tended to be more supportive of radical state socialist principles of the Socialist Labor Party variety. They did not care for anarchy, and tended to dismiss the Socialist Party's reformist philosophy. According to Brissenden, Eastern Wobblies were \\"revolutionary Marxists ‚Äî doctrinaire to the bone ‚Äî saturated with the dialectic.\\"Paul Frederick Brissenden, The I.W.W. A Study of American Syndicalism, Columbia University, 1919, page 234 From 1905 on, many workers in the West were unable to vote. This created a different dynamic from the experiences of early IWW supporters in the East. However, by the time the IWW began to organize textile workers in Lawrence, Massachusetts in 1912, the IWW would confront the same circumstance in the East. In 1913, IWW organizer Bill Haywood would declare, \\"I advocate the industrial ballot alone when I address the workers in the textile industries of the East where a great majority are foreigners without political representation. But when I speak to American workingmen in the West I advocate both the industrial and the political ballot.\\"Helen Marot, Industrial Workers of the World, American labor unions, H. Holt and company, 1914 But by this time, regional differences had already exerted a significant impact on the organization. In some sense, the Western Wobblies would evolve into the Chicago IWW after the split of 1908. The Eastern Wobblies, whom Brissenden believed held most closely to the ideals of the first convention, became the Detroit IWW after the same division.Paul Frederick Brissenden, The I.W.W. A Study of American Syndicalism, Columbia University, 1919, pages 234-236 These two factions became the most visible manifestations of a divided IWW. The Chicago, or \\"Red IWW\\" was referred to variously as the direct action, the economic, the bummery, or the anarchist faction. The Detroit, or \\"Yellow IWW\\" faction was called the doctrinaire, the political, or the socialist faction. However, there were other splits, both before and after this most significant split, in which some of the same philosophical differences played a role. 1906 split For the first several years the differences between those who favored political action via electoral politics, and those who believed that working people could never obtain justice through political action, played out within the IWW. However, other divisions wracked the young organization, initially over the leadership style and practices of President Charles O. Sherman, the first (and only) president of the IWW. Sherman, a failed AFL union leader who sought redemption in the IWW, was accused of expensive habits and financial improprieties, but was also faulted for favoring \\"pure and simple unionism\\" of the AFL variety. IWW organizer James P. Cannon observed that members questioned Sherman's commitment to revolutionary principles espoused at the organization's founding: > Charles O. Sherman, the first general president of the IWW, was an exponent > of the industrial-union form of organization. But that apparently was as far > as he wanted to go, and it wasn‚Äôt far enough for those who took the > revolutionary pronouncements of the First Convention seriously.James P. > Cannon, The IWW, Fourth International, Summer 1955 > http://www.iww.org/en/history/library/Cannon/iww/2 retrieved July 24, 2011 According to Melvyn Dubofsky, Sherman was duplicitous, and used his position as president of the IWW \\"to increase his power and line his own pockets.\\"Melvyn Dubofsky, We Shall Be All, A History of the Industrial Workers of the World, University of Illinois Press Abridged, 2000, page 60 William Trautmann Sherman was supported by conservative elements in the WFM. He was opposed by IWW Secretary Treasurer William Trautmann, Vincent St. John, and Daniel DeLeon, head of the Socialist Labor Party, who averred that they sought to rescue the organization's stated purpose and philosophy‚Äîrevolutionary working class solidarity. The more \\"radical\\" element within the IWW ‚Äî composed of those referred to as \\"beggars, tramps, and proletarian rabble\\" ‚Äî specifically, those who favored direct action, some organization leaders, plus DeLeon's group ‚Äî adopted a member's proposal published in the Industrial Worker which called for abolishing the office of president.Melvyn Dubofsky, We Shall Be All, A History of the Industrial Workers of the World, University of Illinois Press Abridged, 2000, page 61 The proposal was agreed to at the 1906 convention. Vincent St. John Paul Brissenden believed, however, that the issues behind divisions in the first two years were more personality than principle, complicated by intrigue on the part of individuals in the two socialist parties.Paul Frederick Brissenden, The I.W.W. A Study of American Syndicalism, Columbia University, 1919, page 136 Brissenden weighed the arguments of the two sides, and concluded that neither side acted charitably toward the other. Furthermore, Bill Haywood, writing from prison in Idaho before his acquittal, emphatically condemned \\"Shermanism\\", but then chided that with a bit of diplomacy, the troubles could have been smoothed over.Paul Frederick Brissenden, The I.W.W. A Study of American Syndicalism, Columbia University, 1919, pages 141-142 However, with Big Bill's charismatic leadership skills temporarily unavailable, the die had been cast. Haywood would later write (in his autobiography, published in 1929), \\"Sherman had proved incapable, and if not actually dishonest, he had used an enormous amount of the funds for unnecessary purposes.\\"Bill Haywood, The Autobiography of Big Bill Haywood, International Publishers, 1929, page 202 ppbk 1907 photo of (left to right) Charles Moyer, Bill Haywood, and George Pettibone while imprisoned in Idaho, accused by WFM member and police informant Harry Orchard of conspiracy to commit murder. (Orchard found guilty, all others acquitted and/or released) After the Sherman faction was outvoted at the 1906 convention, they took their argument to the largest organization within the IWW, the Western Federation of Miners (WFM). There, the questions of propriety and organizational philosophy raged for the next eighteen months,Melvyn Dubofsky, We Shall Be All, A History of the Industrial Workers of the World, University of Illinois Press Abridged, 2000, pages 59-66 with the WFM ultimately taking a conservative turn under WFM President Charles Moyer. Moyer was incarcerated along with Haywood in Idaho, but was freed without a trial. Haywood's radicalism was affirmed by imprisonment, while Moyer, sharing the same cell, was a changed man. He supported those who were already seeking to withdraw the organization from the IWW and, in spite of the fact that Haywood and St. John were likewise officials in the WFM, Moyer was successful. Historian Joseph Rayback traces the conservative turn of the WFM to the loss of a strike in Goldfield, Nevada, where many of the Cripple Creek miners had migrated after their defeat in the Colorado Labor Wars. While the Colorado governor had mobilized the national guard, the governor of Nevada called for federal troops, which this time \\"reduced leadership to despair\\" and forced the WFM rank and file to finally give up its radical leanings. By 1911, the WFM once again affiliated with the AFL. Thus ended the WFM's decade long flirtation with revolutionary sentiments.Joseph G. Rayback, A History of American Labor, Collier-Macmillin Canada, 1966, pages 242-243 The departure of deposed President Sherman and his supporters from the 1906 convention resulted in the first of several occasions that members found themselves with a choice between two IWWs. While the so-called \\"beggars, tramps, and proletarian rabble\\" ‚Äî the Trautmann-DeLeon-St. John faction ‚Äî finished the convention with theoretical control of the organization, Sherman benefited from \\"the manipulations of a socialist lawyer\\"Bill Haywood, The Autobiography of Big Bill Haywood, International Publishers, 1929, page 203 ppbk to gain possession of the office, the records, and the resources to publish the Industrial Worker, which he continued to publish for a year thereafter. Sherman took the smaller share of union locals, but retained some support within the soon-to- depart Western Federation of Miners.Melvyn Dubofsky, We Shall Be All, A History of the Industrial Workers of the World, University of Illinois Press Abridged, 2000, pages 61-66 Each side claimed to be the real IWW, while simultaneously disparaging the other side. For approximately a year, the Trautmann-DeLeon-St. John faction fought for control, and eventually prevailed. During this time they published a newspaper called the Industrial Union Bulletin instead of the Industrial Worker, only reviving that instrument in 1909. Sherman's supporters held a convention of the \\"Sherman IWW\\" in the summer of 1907, but there seem to be no records of the event. It appeared to be their last gasp as a rump IWW. Although the 1907 convention of the Trautmann-DeLeon-St. John IWW was relatively peaceful, the earlier departures of the WFM and the Sherman crowd didn't bring an end to dissension within the organization. 1908 split While DeLeon had helped to rescue the radical character of the organization from what was alleged to be a conservative and corruptive element, his own beliefs and practices soon became an issue for those same \\"beggars and tramps\\" with whom he'd previously allied. DeLeon's history and personality made him a fairly easy target for dissenters. DeLeon was head of the Socialist Labor Party, which Paul Brissenden described as \\"always ... emphatically Marxian and its leaders have been so decidedly doctrinaire in their interpretation of Marxian socialism ... that they have been not unjustly called impossibilists.\\"Paul Frederick Brissenden, The I.W.W. A Study of American Syndicalism, Columbia University, 1919, page 47 DeLeon's enemies commonly referred to him as the \\"Pope of the S.L.P.\\"Paul Frederick Brissenden, The I.W.W. A Study of American Syndicalism, Columbia University, 1919, page 48 Daniel DeLeon DeLeon believed that a rise in wages for workers resulted in a rise in price, so that workers obtained no worthwhile gain from seeking higher wages. This argument suggested that one of the most significant immediate goals of unions was not worthwhile. James P. Thompson and James Connolly expressed the opposite viewpoint, grounding their writings in the work of Ricardo and Marx. When DeLeon launched a secret hearing against Connolly for \\"economic heresy\\" in 1907, the issue of politics vs. the economic class struggle came to the attention of the entire union, including branches of the organization in Britain and Australia.The I.W.W.: Its First Seventy Years, 1905-1975, Fred W. Thompson and Patrick Murfin, 1976, pages 37-38. DeLeon possessed \\"a supreme confidence in himself and his views,\\" and was \\"highly impatient\\" with those who did not agree. A prolific writer, he hammered away at theory in Socialist Labor Party publications, emphasizing the importance of the IWW's participation in the political fight, and \\"making it unmistakably clear that this meant helping to build\\" the Socialist Labor Party.Philip Sheldon Foner, History of the labor movement in the United States, 1980, 4th edition, page 108 The stage was set for a showdown. =Overalls brigade= Out of the West came the overalls brigade, a group of Wobblies who wore blue denim overalls covering jet black shirts, with red bandannas around their necks. They wore IWW buttons, and they were proud of their organization. They were nineteen men and one woman, and they referred to themselves as \\"red blooded working stiffs.\\" They rode the rails from Portland to the IWW convention in Chicago, stopping in working class communities along the way. They held propaganda meetings at each stop, singing IWW songs and selling literature to finance their trip.Melvyn Dubofsky, We Shall Be All, A History of the Industrial Workers of the World, University of Illinois Press Abridged, 2000, page 78 Led by capable Wobbly organizer James H. Walsh, they traveled over 2,500 miles in their \\"Red Special\\" cattle car, ate in hobo jungles, and preached revolution in prairie towns.The I.W.W.: Its First Seventy Years, 1905-1975, Fred W. Thompson and Patrick Murfin, 1976, pages 38-39 These were itinerant workers from the West ‚Äî representing farm hands, miners, sailors, dock workers, and \\"timber beasts\\" who traveled with the job, and spent much of their time unemployed.Philip Sheldon Foner, History of the labor movement in the United States, 1980, 4th edition, page 107 They couldn't rely upon the vote, because many of them didn't reside in one location long enough to register. They likewise didn't trust that votes counted by \\"some Citizens' Alliance disciple or the Mine Owners Association\\" could ever usher in the revolution. At the convention, DeLeon criticized the newer IWW members \\"for their crudities, their rawness, and their inability to perceive the more 'civilized' methods\\" that he had long recommended to the organization. Historian Rayback comments, \\"It was an ill-advised attack.\\"Joseph G. Rayback, A History of American Labor, Collier-Macmillin Canada, 1966, page 243 The 1905 Preamble to the IWW Constitution had stated, > Between these two classes a struggle must go on until all the toilers come > together on the political, as well as on the industrial field, and take and > hold that which they produce by their labor through an economic organization > of the working class without affiliation with any political party. [emphasis > added]Retrieved July 30, 2007. At the 1908 convention, members of the IWW, led by the overalls brigade, first challenged DeLeon's credentials, declaring that he didn't actually work in the Industrial Union with which he was registered.Joseph G. Rayback, A History of American Labor, Collier-Macmillin Canada, 1966, pages 243-244 Then they removed the Preamble language about \\"struggle [on] the political, as well as on the industrial field,\\" which DeLeon had made a condition of his participation at the founding convention in 1905. The IWW was left with only the industrial struggle delineated in the Preamble. DeLeon and his SLP followers walked out of the convention, never to return.The I.W.W.: Its First Seventy Years, 1905-1975, Fred W. Thompson and Patrick Murfin, 1976, pages 39. Cannon wrote that St. John, in his capacity as the leader of the early IWW, \\"judged socialist 'politics' and political parties by the two examples before his eyes ‚Äî the Socialist Party bossed by Berger and Hillquit and the Socialist Labor Party of De Leon ‚Äî and he didn‚Äôt like either of them.\\"James P.

(It changed its name to Workers' International Industrial Union in 1915).Fred W. Thompson, Patrick Murfin, The IWW: Its First Seventy Years, 1905-1975, 1976, pages 38-40. Robert Hoxie, author of Trade Unionism in the United States, referred to the Detroit IWW as socialistic, and the Chicago IWW as quasi anarchistic.Robert Franklin Hoxie, Lucy Bennett Hoxie, Nathan Fine, Trade Unionism in the United States, D. Appleton and Co., 1921, page 49. Hoxie, who was writing in the 1913-14 time-frame (his book was a joint effort published in 1921), wrote that socialistic unions (some of which were AFL unions) \\"look forward to a state of society which, except for common ownership and control of industry and strong centralized government in the hands of the working class, does not differ essentially from our own.\\"Robert Franklin Hoxie, Lucy Bennett Hoxie, Nathan Fine, Trade Unionism in the United States, D. Appleton and Co., 1921, page 166. Although they were \\"revolutionary,\\" they would attain their goals by peaceful means, both political and industrial. The quasi anarchistic unionists, on the other hand, envision an industrial society in which the unions would act as the government. Hoxie believed that quasi anarchistic unions were abhorrent of political action. Other authors have a different interpretation.

Thus, the non-political, direct action focus of the surviving organization evolved over a period of time. =The Detroit IWW= The Detroit IWW (which became the WIIU) created an industrial union structure that was similar to that of the IWW.Marion Dutton Savage, Industrial Unionism in America, 1922, page 173. The split between the Chicago IWW and the Detroit IWW was replicated in Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Britain.Verity Burgmann, The IWW in International Perspective: comparing the North American and Australasian Wobblies, Australian Society for the Study of Labour History, 2007, retrieved March 22, 2009. In 1909, the Detroit IWW reported 23 local organizations.Paul Frederick Brissenden, The I.W.W. A Study of American Syndicalism, Columbia University, 1919, page 231 In the United States, the areas represented were mostly in the East, including Philadelphia, Boston, Bridgeport, Brooklyn, and Paterson.Paul Frederick Brissenden, The I.W.W. A Study of American Syndicalism, Columbia University, 1919, page 229 Unlike the IWW, which from 1908 onwards constitutionally restricted itself from political alliances, the WIIU advocated political associations, and maintained its close association with the SLP, although (as of 1922) it declined to openly affirm this association.Marion Dutton Savage, Industrial Unionism in America, 1922, page 175. Like the IWW, the WIIU advocated use of the general strike.Revolutionary Radicalism, New York (State) Legislature, Joint Legislative Committee to Investigate Seditious Activities, Clayton Riley, page 908. The WIIU was criticized for focusing more on party propaganda than on organizing workers. From 1908 to 1922, the relationship between the IWW and the WIIU was characterized as \\"bitter\\". When the WIIU reported its routine labor statistics to The American Labor Year Book for 1916 (shortly after changing its name), it included ‚Äî along with its declaration of principles and its membership stats ‚Äî an editorial comment on the perceived practices of the \\"Chicago IWW\\", > The Workers' International Industrial Union is the new name adopted in 1915 > to designate the socialist industrial class union, which was organized in > 1905 under the name of the Industrial Workers of the World. The change of > name was deemed advantageous to distinguish the Socialist organization from > the one which follows the tenets of anarchy, advocates \\"sabotage,\\" and so- > called \\"direct action,\\" usually denoting non-political action. The career of > the so-called Industrial Workers of the World was started at the fourth > convention of the I. W. W. in 1908 with the slogan: \\"Strike at the ballot > box with an ax.\\"The American labor year book, Volume 1, Rand School of > Social Science. Dept. of Labor Research, 1916, page 37 The WIIU shared much of its membership with the SLP, and struggled after DeLeon's death in 1914. According to labor historian Philip Foner, the WIIU never did conduct a strike of any importance.Philip Sheldon Foner, History of the labor movement in the United States, 1980, 4th edition, page 110. It disbanded in 1924. The Detroit IWW, which became the Workers' International Industrial Union in 1916, published the Industrial Union News. =The Chicago IWW= The Chicago IWW is the organization that survives as the modern Industrial Workers of the World. After the 1908 split, the Chicago IWW began to refer to itself as the Red IWW, and the Detroit group as the Yellow IWW.An Alphabet Soup - the IWW Union Dictionary, IWW website, http://www.iww.org/culture/official/dictionary retrieved March 20, 2009. Daniel DeLeon's followers referred to the Chicago IWW, who ultimately retained the mantle, if not the founding philosophy of the IWW, as \\"the bummery\\".Paul Frederick Brissenden, The I.W.W. A Study of American Syndicalism, Columbia University, 1919, page 220 In 1909, the Chicago IWW reported 100 local organizations. From 1908 onwards, the more energetic Chicago IWW could take credit for far the greatest share of organizing and propagandizing.Paul Frederick Brissenden, The I.W.W. A Study of American Syndicalism, Columbia University, 1919, page 235 Hoxie observed that quasi anarchistic unionists like those in the Chicago IWW have a different goal than the socialistic unionists such as the Detroit IWW: > They look forward to the complete abolition of the state and of existing > governmental machinery. They visualize, not a political, but an industrial > society, where the unions would be the government. All political action is > abhorrent to them, partly because the state is outside their scheme of > things and political action is a recognition of a compromise with it, but > largely because they believe that experience has proved it to be not only > useless as a working-class weapon but positively harmful to working class > interests. Hoxie continues, > [The Chicago IWW unionists] have noted that political associations and > political gains make the workers soft, conservative, and nonrevolutionary. > Revolution degenerates into mere reform, and political preferment makes > traitors of working-class leaders . . . Direct action, therefore, has become > their slogan, that is, the making and enforcing of demands upon the enemy > directly by the workers, through demonstrations, strikes, sabotage and > violence. At this point, however, the quasi anarchistic revolutionary > unionists themselves split into two camps, centralizers and > decentralizers.Robert Franklin Hoxie, Lucy Bennett Hoxie, Nathan Fine, Trade > Unionism in the United States, D. Appleton and Co., 1921, page 166-67. The IWW newspaper that focused most specifically on the Western United States (and which continues to be published today) is the Industrial Worker (which, for a time after the 1906 split, was duplicated and/or replaced by the Industrial Union Bulletin). In the East, the IWW newspaper of record for the Chicago IWW was Solidarity. Seeds of another split Foner identified a schism within the Chicago IWW in addition to the east/west divide, consisting of those who wanted a labor union with a revolutionary program, and those who merely wanted to be a revolutionary cadre leading the working class to revolution via propaganda and agitation.Philip S. Foner, History of the Labor Movement in the United States, Vol. 4, The Industrial Workers of the World 1905-1917, International Publishers, 1997, page 114 Many other analysts, however, identified two contesting groups essentially according to what they called themselves ‚Äî centralizers and decentralizers. Centralizers Of the centralizers, Hoxie observes, > The centralizers believe that the actual building up of the industrial > organization will train and educate the workers in the conduct, not only of > industry, but of all social affairs, so that when the organization has > become universalized it can perform all the necessary functions of social > control now exercised by the state in its legislative, executive and > judicial capacities. This universal organization of the workers will then > displace the state, government and politics in the present sense; private > ownership, privilege and exploitation will be forever abolished. The one big > union will have become the state, the government, the supreme organic and > functional expression of society; its rules and decisions will be the > law.Robert Franklin Hoxie, Lucy Bennett Hoxie, Nathan Fine, Trade Unionism > in the United States, D. Appleton and Co., 1921, page 167. Decentralizers Hoxie explains the decentralizers, > The decentralizers look forward to what they call a free industrial society. > Each local group of workers is to be a law to itself. They are to organize > as they please. The present industrial and social arrangements are to be > overthrown simply by making it unprofitable for the employing class to own > and operate industries. Future society is to consist of independent groups > of workers freely exchanging their products. The proper proportions of > investments and production, the ratio of exchange of goods, etc., will > automatically be determined, just as they are under competitive industry, > only then the competition will be between groups of workers, instead of > between individuals. Universal knowledge and a superior morality, which will > spring up as soon as capitalist society is abolished, will take the place of > our present complicated system of social control and do away with the > necessity of government in the present sense.Robert Franklin Hoxie, Lucy > Bennett Hoxie, Nathan Fine, Trade Unionism in the United States, D. Appleton > and Co., 1921, page 167-68. Beyond the described differences, Hoxie concludes, the theories, methods, and policies of the centralizers and the decentralizers were much the same.Robert Franklin Hoxie, Lucy Bennett Hoxie, Nathan Fine, Trade Unionism in the United States, D. Appleton and Co., 1921, page 168. But historian Philip S. Foner described the decentralizers as \\"the most vehement and noisiest of the anti- leadership element.\\" They wanted to remove all officers of the union, and replace them with a stenographer. They also sought to abolish the union's General Executive Board and the annual convention. In 1913 a majority of delegates rejected the goals of the decentralizers, yet they continued their efforts for years afterward.Philip S. Foner, History of the Labor Movement in the United States, Vol. 4, The Industrial Workers of the World 1905-1917, International Publishers, 1997, page 145 1924 split In 1924 (three years after Hoxie's analyses were published), as the Detroit IWW languished, the Chicago IWW was once again split by a division between centralizers and decentralizers. =Impact of the divisions= In 1919 Paul Brissenden wrote that while the departure of Sherman and the Western Federation of Miners in 1906, and the DeLeon faction in 1908, meant the loss of its \\"most reputable, best financed, and most respectable elements, their loss tended to give sharp definition and emphatic impulse toward a more revolutionary policy.\\"Paul Frederick Brissenden, The I.W.W. A Study of American Syndicalism, Columbia University, 1919, page 177 As a result, the IWW became the champion of unskilled and migratory workers, including workers facing frequent unemployment, during the decade that followed. Brissenden commented in 1919 that, > [The Wobblies] were able to develop great strength because they had modified > their theories to the extent necessary to make some appreciable application > of them to the actual conditions of economic life. They were confronted by > conditions and met them at the cost of doctrinal consistency. They were > unconscious pragmatists and the result is that they have made themselves > felt to a much greater extent than the doctrinaires [of the Detroit IWW]. > They have been strikingly successful as gadflies‚Äîstinging and shocking the > bourgeoisie into the initiation of reforms.Paul Frederick Brissenden, The > I.W.W. A Study of American Syndicalism, Columbia University, 1919, page 258 Yet Brissenden wrote that the question of decentralization was \\"perhaps the most fundamental [issue] ever given wide discussion by the I.W.W. membership.\\"Paul Frederick Brissenden, The I.W.W. A Study of American Syndicalism, Columbia University, 1919, page 304 Brissenden, acknowledging in 1919 that the decentralization forces within the IWW had not dissipated, had a sense of foreboding about the future of that organization. He wrote, \\"the doctrine was not annihilated in 1913; it was merely smothered. The I.W.W. may yet be 'unscrambled'.\\" In spite of \\"anti-radical hysteria\\" during and just after the war years, the IWW continued to grow. The IWW's peak membership probably occurred in 1923.Daniel Earl Saros, Labor, industry, and regulation during the progressive era, Taylor & Francis US, 2009, page 63 1924 would see the beginning of a dramatic decline, and the recent repression would work to exacerbate the internal tensions responsible for that decline. There were a number of reasons that the IWW faced division in 1924. Wobbly leaders who had been arrested and imprisoned during or after World War I on espionage charges (for opposing the war) had just been released in two groups; some, in mid-1923, agreed to a pardon that stipulated they must refrain from activities related to their former union activism. Their decision was viewed with suspicion by the IWW, and by those who refused the pardon. Those who chose to stay in prison were released in December 1923, but their circumstances were likewise divisive.Melvyn Dubofsky, We Shall Be All, A History of the Industrial Workers of the World, University of Illinois Press Abridged, 2000, pages 263-264 The IWW reacted to the repression commencing in 1917, in part, by making all former leaders of the IWW ineligible for office. Ralph Darlington observed that this \\"effectively severed the organization from its past, decapitating the IWW even more ruthlessly than the government had been able to.\\"Ralph Darlington, Syndicalism and the transition to communism: an international comparative analysis, Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2008, page 168 Some former leaders, including John Reed, James P. Cannon, and William Z. Foster, had joined the Communist Party, and disagreement over bolshevism created additional dissension.Melvyn Dubofsky, We Shall Be All, A History of the Industrial Workers of the World, University of Illinois Press Abridged, 2000, page 264 One IWW leader, George Williams, had been in Moscow in 1921, and formed a bad opinion of the political situation in the Soviet Union. He warned against possible Communist influence in the IWW, stating that it would endanger both the principles of the IWW, and the organization itself. Acting upon Williams' recommendation, the IWW chose to oppose Bolshevism.Melvyn Dubofsky, We Shall Be All, A History of the Industrial Workers of the World, University of Illinois Press Abridged, 2000, pages 264-265 But Bolshevism was only a complicating factor. The centralist-decentralist split would play the decisive role in the future of the IWW. Two IWWs, side by side The modern IWW website describes a historical offshoot led by James Rowan of the Lumber Workers Industrial Union (LWIU), who invoked the E-P (Emergency Program). The other faction was sometimes called the \\"Four Trey\\" group, taking their name from the address of the IWW headquarters at 3333 W. Belmont in Chicago.Archie Green, Wobblies, pile butts, and other heroes: laborlore explorations, University of Illinois Press, 1993, page 82 Once again, the question of politics played a significant role between union factions. At the 1924 IWW convention, decentralist Rowan scheduled a session in parallel with the official session controlled by the leadership. The result was two competing factions who, as in 1906, fought in the streets and in the courts for control of IWW headquarters.Melvyn Dubofsky, We Shall Be All, A History of the Industrial Workers of the World, University of Illinois Press Abridged, 2000, page 265 In his book about the IWW We Shall Be All, Melvyn Dubofsky concluded that the IWW had torn itself apart through internal conflict, and that the result was \\"total collapse\\". Rowan formed an \\"emergency program\\" (the \\"E-P\\") from his base in Washington state, in an effort to save the IWW. \\"The E-Pers believed that the administration of the IWW was too strongly emphasizing 'Political Action' as opposed to Organizing on the Job. The E-P claimed to oppose 'centralism' in favor of 'decentralism', but the E-P sought to centralize power within individual Industrial Unions.\\" =Decline of the IWW after 1924= Archie Green attributed the decline of the IWW to the 1924 split, which was exacerbated by government persecution, and the defection of many members to the Communist Party. At the 1925 convention, there were only eleven delegates. There were no conventions in 1926 and 1927.Melvyn Dubofsky, We Shall Be All, A History of the Industrial Workers of the World, University of Illinois Press Abridged, 2000, pages 265-266 During this period, in some parts of the country, there were two IWW halls, some of them very near to each other, each following one faction or the other.Eugene Nelson, Break Their Haughty Power, Joe Murphy in the Heyday of the Wobblies, ISM Press, 1993 (2001), page 285. This material (side by side IWW halls) subject to confirmation. Break Their Haughty Power is a biographical novel based upon oral history. By 1930, Rowan's separatist movement was bankrupt and had about two hundred followers. By 1931 the E-P, which had been the smaller of the two factions, ceased to exist. Presumably, many in the E-P group began to drift back into the main IWW faction. However, a significant number of members \\"dropped out the middle\\" during the period of infighting.Fred W. Thompson and Patrick Murfin, The IWW: Its First Seventy Years, 1905-1975, Industrial Workers of the World, publisher, 1976, pages 151-155 In the 2009 book Labor, industry, and regulation during the progressive era, Daniel Earl Saros concluded that however one characterizes its successes and failures, the IWW \\"demonstrates that strong challenges were being made to the ideology of social responsibility and that the defenders of that ideology had much to gain from the suppression of radical alternatives.\\" See also * Industrial Workers of the World philosophy and tactics * Labor federation competition in the United States * One Big Union (concept) References IWW ","title":"History of the Industrial Workers of the World"},{"id":"31172971","text":"Marshmallow Love Seat #5670, commonly known as the Marshmallow sofa, is a modernist sofa produced by the American furniture company Herman Miller, that was originally manufactured between 1956 and 1961. It is considered the most iconic of all modernist sofas. The sofa was designed by Irving Harper of George Nelson Associates. It was produced in two lengths from 1956 to 1961. It consists of a metal frame with round discs of covered foam, or \\"marshmallows\\", spread across the seat and back in a lattice arrangement. The sofa, in the smaller of the two sizes, was re-issued in the 1980s as part of the \\"Herman Miller Classics\\" line, and continues in production today. History The design was created in 1954 when a salesman for a Long Island plastics company presented to George Nelson's New York City studio an example of the company's ability to create round, 12-inch foam discs that became \\"self-skinned\\". The limited manufacturing costs made the item inviting, and designer Irving Harper was asked to design a piece of furniture around the discs. Over a weekend Harper designed a sofa, incorporating 18 of the discs arranged over a metal frame. The invention did not live up to its promise, as covering the individual seat pads proved costly and time-consuming, turning the intended budget piece into a luxury product. Nevertheless, Herman Miller went ahead with the sofa's production, and introduced it in 1956. The Marshmallow sofa was originally issued by Herman Miller in 1956, and appeared in their 1957 catalog. The sofa was dropped in 1961. Despite its popularity, and visibility in Herman Miller publications, only 186 Marshmallow sofas were produced between 1956 and 1961. The 52\\" version was re-issued in the 1980s as part of the \\"Herman Miller Classics\\" line, and continues in production today, though in limited numbers. Design Officially listed by Herman Miller as the Marshmallow love seat #5670, the sofa was designed for both residential and contract (office) sales. The playful design of the Marshmallow sofa is the result of placement of circular \\"marshmallow\\" cushions at regular intervals across a metal frame. The cushions were covered in either fabric, vinyl, or leather in bright colors. Generally all the cushions were the same color, but the sofa could also be ordered with cushions of various colors for a more whimsical look. The Marshmallow sofa was designed in the \\"atomistic\\" style seen in other classic George Nelson Associates designs, such as the \\"Ball clock\\" (1950) and the \\"Hang-It-All\\" (1953). The \\"atomistic\\" style explodes its parts into separate, brightly colored elements, in this case the seat cushions. It was an adaptation of artist's representations of the atom, which used individual, brightly colored dots to portray atomic particles. The marshmallow sofa was produced in two lengths. The 52\\" version incorporates 18 cushions in a pattern of 4-5-5-4. The 103\\" length uses 38 cushions in a 9-10-10-9 pattern. Design attribution The Marshmallow sofa was designed in 1954 by Irving Harper. For decades the design of the Marshmallow sofa was attributed to George Nelson, as was the practice for designs coming out of George Nelson Associates, Inc. However, it was later revealed that many of the firm's designs were actually those of other designers working for the firm. John Pile, a designer who worked for George Nelson Associates, Inc. in the 1950s explained, \\"George's attitude was that it was okay for individual designers to be given credit in trade publications, but for the consumer world, the credit should always be to the firm, not the individual. He didn't always follow through on that policy though.\\" As collectors' items Examples of the 186 originally produced sofas routinely sell for $15,000 or more. The extremely rare 103\\" length is rarely offered for sale. One example, covered in white fabric and signed by Irving Harper was sold by Sotheby's in 2000 for $37,500.

Facts TMC Transport (UK) Ltd‚Äôs former directors were Mr Bernasconi and Mr Monti. Mr Morphitis was the liquidator.

The case turned on whether knowingly failing to pay a final instalment to their landlord was enough to constitute fraudulent trading under the Insolvency Act 1986, section 213.

Not every fraudulent transaction makes the business a business carried on with intent to defraud. Moreover, there must be a causal connection between the fraud and the loss, or ‚Äòsome nexus between (i) the loss which has been caused to the company‚Äôs creditors generally by the carrying on of the business in the manner which gives rise to the exercise of the power and (ii) the contribution which those knowingly party to the carrying on of the business in that manner should be ordered to make to the assets in which the company‚Äôs creditors will share in the liquidation.‚Äô Then, obiter he said it could not have been the intention of Parliament to allow more than compensatory claims under section 213.

Built in 1877, it is now a Grade II* listed building with a wide variety of cultural uses. In early 2013, it was bought by nearly five hundred people, through one of the country's largest community share issues.  History  The building, designed by architect JH Jenkinson was constructed in the late 1870s as a cutlery works. Three two- and three-storey ranges of brick-built workshops, offices and showrooms lie around a courtyard containing an octagonal chimney and some more recent structures. The central part of the rear range of workshops was reduced from three to two stories, following a fire. It was occupied for many years by R. F. Mosley, before being split into separate workshops. When first constructed, it was partially mechanised. When surveyed by English Heritage in 1995, it still retained hand forges and a steam-grinding room. In 1914, through a collaboration between Harry Brearley, Ernest Stuart and R. F. Mosley at Portland Works, this became the first place in the world to manufacture stainless steel cutlery and this remains, to this day, one of the site's many activities. The city of Sheffield in itself is strongly associated with its steel industry heritage not least in sporting world, with the ice hockey team known as the Sheffield Steelers and one of the local football teams, Sheffield United being nicknamed 'The Blades'. Bramall Lane, Sheffield United's football ground, is within walking distance of Portland Works.  Music and art  = Musicians = Portland Works has recently come to be an area associated with the music and art scene. Bands such as Kimmy Yeah, Dosch and Big Eyes Family Players use Portland Works to practise, and there are studio facilities for use by other bands. Def Leppard notably used the works for early band rehearsals. =Artists= As well as musicians, a number of artists make use of the space at Portland Works, including Clare Hughes, Mary Sewell and Nuala Price. One of the most notable pieces of artwork created by any of the artists in Portland Works is that depicting the ghost of Portland Works (a painting by Mary Sewell).  Campaign  A view inside Portland Works Portland Works is one of very few Sheffield metal trades buildings to have a continuous history of manufacturing since its construction, in 1877. For many years it was the home of R. F. Mosley's cutlery business. In 2009, a planning application was submitted for Portland Works to be converted into residential flats. As a result of this, concerned tenants and supporters set up a campaign to save Portland Works and offer an alternative future based on the existing mix of tenants. The 'Save Portland Works' campaign group became a Community Benefit Society in 2011, operating on co-operative principles. The Portland Works website outlines the campaign, through which almost ¬£500,000 was eventually raised, with help from the Architectural Heritage Fund website to buy the works outright in early 2013. The building is now community owned and operated by over 500 shareholders through one of the largest community benefit societies in the UK. Since 2013 a dedicated group of volunteers have been renovating the building, working to preserve as much of the original fabric as possible. By late 2017 about 25% of the Works had been so restored. The volunteers have focussed on retaining as much of the original fabric as possible, leading to extensive work being done to retain original pitch-pine window frames, hand forging replacement window catches and pointing the brickwork with lime mortars. Interiors are being done equally sensitively whilst attempting to provide some degree of modern comforts, such as roof insulation, good lighting and fire alarms. Meanwhile much work is being done in 2018 on restoring many of the complex roofs, funded by an HLF grant. A shared meeting space has been created from two street-side workshops, for community and educational use, and a small museum has been built in an adjacent room, celebrating the Mosley family cutlery business and the people who worked there. \\"Robert Fead Mosley\\" by Anna de Lange (published 2013) outlines the history of the works.

Facts The liquidator of Purpoint Ltd, a printing business, sued the former director Mr John Henry Meredith for wrongful trading and misfeasance under the Insolvency Act 1986 sections 212 and 214. Purpoint Ltd started trading in February 1986, with a plant and machinery, a printing press and two cars on hire purchase. Mr Meredith got a salary. Mr Meredith admitted the company was unable to pay its debts from December 1986. In May 1987, the accountants told him that he could be liable for trading while insolvent. In June Mr Meredith found a job with another firm. Purpoint Ltd ceased trading in November 1987 and went into liquidation in May 1988. The Inland Revenue's claims exhausted all the company's assets. The liquidator brought an action under section 214 and under section 212 claimed back money used to get the second car on hire purchase, which it said was not needed for the business; cash sums withdrawn in June and July 1987 and transactions between the company and the firm Mr Meredith left to work with. Judgment Vinelott J held that Mr Meredith was liable and ordered him to pay ¬£12,666.79 under section 212 (¬£4k for the car, ¬£5k for cash withdrawals and ¬£3k for work done for the firm) and ¬£53,572.15 plus interest under section 214. Under section 212 (1) the car was not bought for business use, and the purchase was a breach of duty (2) cash that could not be accounted for and used by Mr Meredith and his wife had to be repaid (3) on one transaction the new firm Mr Meredith had moved to make a profit at the company's expense. He had to disgorge this gain. Under section 214, because Mr Meredith clearly knew the company was insolvent by December 1986, he was liable for all trading losses after then. Lastly, there was nothing wrong with making orders under both section 212 and section 214. He said the answer to double recovery arguments is that money recouped under s 212 can be used to pay off the debts that existed before the clock started to run under section 214. The only proviso is that Mr Meredith would not be made to pay back more under section 212 than needed to meet the company's liabilities.

It lives in burrows in muddy sand in shallow waters off North America. Description Phascolopsis gouldii can reach thirty centimetres long and is a smooth slender cylindrical shape. The body is pinkish and divided into an anterior introvert and a posterior trunk. The introvert is about one quarter of the length of the body and can be retracted inside it by turning outside in. This is done by the contraction of two pairs of large introvert retractor muscles which extend from the body wall of the trunk to near the mouth which is at the tip of the introvert in the centre of the oral disc. This is surrounded by a ring of short tentacles that are used for feeding and in gas exchange. They are pink inside due to the presence of the pigment hemerythrin used in oxygen transport. The anus is on a small mound where the trunk and introvert join. The trunk is covered by a thick integument and is largely composed of bands of longitudinal muscles which can be seen through the cuticle. The anterior part of the trunk, into which the introvert retracts, is broader than the posterior part. Distribution This peanut worm is found in shallow coastal waters on the eastern seaboard of the United States from Connecticut to Florida. and Canada.Global Biodiversity Information Facility Particular locations where it has been found include Cobscook Bay, the Gulf of Maine, Minister's Island, Indian Point, Newfoundland and the St Lawrence estuary. Biology Phascolopsis gouldii burrows in muddy sand. It can pull itself under the surface by pushing its introvert down and then retracting it. It is a deposit and filter feeder, collecting detritus with its tentacles for insertion into its mouth or for consumption after retraction of the introvert. It is able to feed with its introvert while its soft trunk remains in the safety of the burrow.Peanut worms It is dioecious but the sexes are similar. They release eggs and sperm simultaneously into the water and external fertilisation takes place.

The Portuguese expeditionary force, led by Prince Henry the Navigator, Duke of Viseu, set out from Portugal in August 1437, intending to seize a series of Moroccan coastal citadels. The Portuguese laid siege to Tangier in mid-September. After a few failed assaults on the city, the Portuguese force was attacked and defeated by a large Moroccan relief army led by vizier Abu Zakariya Yahya al-Wattasi of Fez. The Moroccans encircled the Portuguese siege camp and starved it to submission. To preserve his army from destruction, Henry negotiated a treaty promising to return the citadel of Ceuta (captured earlier in 1415) to Morocco in return for being allowed to withdraw his troops. As it turns out, the terms of the treaty never were fulfilled; the Portuguese decided to hold on to Ceuta and allowed the Portuguese hostage, the king's own brother Ferdinand the Holy Prince, to remain in Moroccan captivity, where he perished in 1443. The Tangier fiasco was a tremendous setback for the prestige and reputation of Henry the Navigator, who personally conceived, promoted and led the expedition. Simultaneously, it was an enormous boon to the political fortunes of the vizier Abu Zakariya Yahya al-Wattasi, who was transformed overnight from an unpopular regent to a national hero, allowing him to consolidate his power over Morocco. This was the first of four attempts by the Portuguese to seize the city of Tangier in the 15th century.  Background  The Moroccan citadel of Ceuta, on the southern side of the Strait of Gibraltar, had been seized in 1415 in a surprise attack by the Kingdom of Portugal. (See Conquest of Ceuta). The Marinids had tried to recover it in 1418‚Äì1419, but failed. The assassination of the Marinid sultan in 1420 sent Morocco reeling into political chaos and internal disorder for the next few years, giving the Portuguese time to entrench themselves in Ceuta.Julien, pp. 195‚Äì196 Whatever its original objectives, the capture of Ceuta had profited the Portuguese little.Russell, 2000, various place, e.g. p. 135, 142, 143, 152 The Moroccans had cut off all of Ceuta's trade and supplies from the landward side. Ceuta became little more than a large, empty, windswept fortress-city, with an expensive Portuguese garrison that had to be continually re-supplied from across the sea. There had been no follow-up Portuguese campaigns in North Africa, with the result that the Ceuta garrison had little to do, beyond waiting and eating through the king's treasury. There were growing calls in the Portuguese court to simply withdraw the troops and abandon Ceuta.Russell, 2000 = Henry's proposal = In 1416, King John I of Portugal placed his son, the Portuguese Prince Henry the Navigator, Duke of Viseu, in charge of supplying and provisioning Ceuta.Monumenta Henricina, Vol. II, p. 240 As a result, Henry was disinclined to abandoning the city, and instead urged an expansion of Portuguese holdings in Morocco. polyptych of St. Vicent by painter Nuno Gon√ßalves, believed to represent the four younger sons of John I: Ferdinand the Holy (on top, in black), John of Reguengos (left, red), Peter of Coimbra (right, green), Henry the Navigator (bottom, purple) In 1432, Henry the Navigator proposed to his father King John I of Portugal an ambitious project to allow him to lead a war of conquest of Marinid Morocco, or at least carve out a wider regional enclave in the north.Russell, 2000: Ch. 6, p. 136ff. The king called on the royal council, including the rest of his sons ‚Äì the √çnclita Gera√ß√£o ‚Äì for consultation. Henry's brothers, the princes Edward of Portugal, Peter of Coimbra, John of Reguengos, their half-brother Afonso of Barcelos and Afonso's grown sons, Ferdinand of Arraiolos and Afonso of Our√©m, almost unanimously pronounced themselves against the project. They cited the lack of Portuguese manpower and the huge expense of conquering and holding such a large area, and questioned the purpose and legal basis of the conquest.Four of the written opinions (pareceres) of April‚ÄìJune 1432, are preserved in Monumenta Henricana, vol. IV: Ferdinand of Arraiolos (p. 99), John of Reguengos (p. 111), Afonso of Barcelos (p. 123) and Afonso of Our√©m (p. 129). A summary of the opinions can be found in Russell (2000: Ch.6). The opinion of Peter of Coimbra at this time is unknown, but was probably negative, as can be deduced from his later statements, e.g. see Ruy de Pina's Chronica del Rey D. Duarte, ch. 19 Moreover, they subtly expressed doubts about Henry's ability to lead such an expedition, and suggested that if Henry was intent on military glory or crusade, then he perhaps ought to enter the service of the Crown of Castile and campaign on the Granadan frontier instead.The suggestion to divert the campaign to Granada was pushed in particular by the Barcelos brood. See the Monumenta Henricina, vol. IV and Rusell, Ch. 6 (Indeed, such a proposal was submitted to Castile a month later (July 1432) by a Portuguese emissary, but was rejected out of hand by the Castilian strongman √Ålvaro de Luna.Russell, p. 149) In defense of the project, Henry pointed out the Marinid kingdom of Morocco was deeply fractured among rebellious lords and the leadership in Fez was embroiled in political crisis. The young Marinid sultan Abd al-Haqq II was coming of age, but his unpopular Wattasid vizier (and regent since 1420), Abu Zakariya Yahya al-Wattasi, refused to yield power.Julien, p. 196 Henry calculated the divided and distracted Marinids would not be able to organize much of a defense, that the time was opportune to take another piece of Morocco. Henry also believed the manpower concerns were exaggerated, that it would be sufficient to seize and hold the critical ports of Tangier, Ksar es-Seghir, and Asilah, to exert Portuguese dominance over all of northern Morocco, and that should the pope give the campaign the privileges of a crusade, soldiers from all over Portugal and Christian Europe would rally to enlist and fill in the gap.The only primary record of Henry's opinion is his later parecer, dated 1436 (month unknown), and reproduced in Monumenta Henricina, vol. V, p. 201. See the summary in Russell, 2000: pp. 156‚Äì158 King John I seemed inclined towards the project, but died in 1433 before any steps were taken.Russell, p. 160 His oldest son and successor, Edward of Portugal, set the project aside, but Henry continued lobbying for it. Henry soon obtained a critical ally, his youngest brother Prince Ferdinand, who was dissatisfied with his meager estates in Portugal and eager to seek his fortune overseas.Ruy de Pina, Chronica d'El Rey D. Duarte, Ch. 10; Russell, 2000: p. 151; Quintella, p. 85, all of whom suggest that Ferdinand's dissatisfaction may have been calculatedly stoked by Henry. In 1435, Henry and Ferdinand jointly informed Edward that they intended to campaign in Morocco on their own if need be, with their own resources, taking their military orders with them: Henry his Order of Christ and Ferdinand his Order of Aviz.Pina, ch. 11; Russell, pp. 151‚Äì152 Edward, backed by his other brothers, tried to dissuade them, and urged Henry and Ferdinand to go on campaign for Castile instead.Another ambassador had been sent to Castile to offer it again. See Monumenta Henricina, vol. V, p. 42 This time, however, Henry seemed to have roped in an unlikely ally, Edward's wife, Eleanor of Aragon. Being the sister of the rebellious 'Infantes of Aragon', Eleanor had no desire to see Portuguese arms used to assist the Crown of Castile, and she nudged her husband toward authorizing the Moroccan expedition.The importance of Eleanor's influence is emphasized by Ruy de Pina, Chronica de D. Duarte, ch. 12. However Russell (p. 152) casts some doubts upon it. See also Quintella, p. 85 What probably finally won Edward over was the bachelor Henry's promise to adopt Edward's younger son, Infante Ferdinand (future Duke of Viseu), as the sole heir to all his seigneurial estates, thus relieving the king from having to provide for his inheritance. Henry wrote his will in his nephew's favor in March 1436, and that very month, Edward launched preparations for the expedition.Henry's will and testament of 7 March 1436 can be found in Monumenta Henricina, vol. V,p. 205. See Russell, p. 168 = Preparations = In March, Edward and Henry outlined the first plans for a campaign to capture Tangier, Ksar es-Seghir, and Asilah.Pina, Ch. 6, reproduced in Monumenta Henricina, vol. 5, p. 208 The total force envisaged was 14,000 ‚Äì 4,000 horse and 10,000 foot. (Or, more precisely in Pina's breakdown: 3,500 knights, 500 mounted archers, 7,000 infantry, 2,500 foot archers, and 500 servants.Ruy de Pina, p. 67. Frei Jo√£o √Ålvares (p. 46) agrees on the total number. See also Quintella, p. 86; Russell, p. 161) Contractors were sent immediately for the ports of England, Castile, Flanders, and northern Germany to contract additional transport ships and supplies.Pina, p. 70; Quintella, p. 86 In mid-April, King Edward of Portugal assembled the Portuguese Cortes in Evora to raise funds for the expedition.Quintella, p. 86; Russell, p. 160 The proposal met a skeptical response. The burghers were opposed to the expedition. Nonetheless, the Cortes voted for a modest subsidy, not without complaint.Pina, p. 68; Quintella, p. 86; Russell, pp. 160‚Äì161 According to chronicler Ruy de Pina, Edward 'forgot' to summon the dissenting brothers ‚Äì Peter of Coimbra, John of Reguengos, and Afonso of Barcelos ‚Äì to the Evora parliament. So the three were invited to the king's court in Leiria in August to submit their votes.Pina, pp. 70‚Äì71; Quintella, p. 87 Although they were warned by the king that their vote was immaterial, that the project was going forward regardless, all three nonetheless insisted on registering their vote against it.Quintella, p. 87; Ruy de Pina's Chronica reproduces the statements of John of Reguengos ch. 17, Afonso of Barcelos ch. 18 and Peter of Coimbra ch. 19. The editors of the Monumenta Henricina cast doubt on their veracity. = Papal bulls = In the meantime, Henry the Navigator had been busy lobbying the pope to endorse the expedition.Russell, p. 153 This bore fruit in September, when Pope Eugenius IV issued the bull Rex Regnum blessing the Tangiers enterprise with the privileges of a crusade.Pope Eugenius IV's bull Rex Regnum (September 8, 1436) can be found in Monumenta Henricana, vol. 5, (p. 271) However this was not issued without misgivings. Pope Eugenius IV requested learned opinions on the legality of Henry's war of conquest in Muslim Morocco. The legal opinions, delivered between August and October, notably the reports by Bologna jurists Antonio Minucci da Pratoveccio and Antonio de Rosellis, deeply doubted the jus bellum foundations of the expedition.Copies of the legal reports are found in Monumenta Henricina, vol. 5 ‚Äì legal opinion received Aug‚ÄìSep. 1436 p. 261, another of the same date, p. 266; Pratovecchio's opinion, Oct. 36 p. 285 Rosselli's opinion, Oct. 36 p. 320. For a summary of their content, see Russell, pp. 161‚Äì164. While knocking down every one of Henry's arguments, the jurists nonetheless ultimately approved the expedition on a very stretched historical technicality: namely, that the Marinids were in occupation of the ancient Roman province of Mauretania, which rightfully belonged to the Holy Roman Emperor; but as the emperor had not taken any steps to recover it, it was thus \\"legal\\" for one of his 'vassals' (the King of Portugal, as the heir of the 5th-century foederati contract of the Visigoths) to do so on his own initiative. However, another of Henry's side-projects nearly sunk the whole enterprise. The same month (September), Pope Eugenius IV issued another bull at Henry's request, Romanus Pontifex, granting Portugal the right to subjugate the unconquered part of the Canary Islands.Monumenta Henricina, Vol. V: Henry's request, August 1436 p. 254; Pope Eugenius IV's Romanus Pontifex (Sep 15,1437), p. 281 This bold intrusion roused the Crown of Castile, who had long laid claim to the islands, and was still in the process of conquering them. The Castilian prelate Alfonso de Cartagena, Bishop of Burgos, then attending the Council of Basel, launched a legal offensive, supplying volumes of documents proving that all of the Canaries rightfully belonged to Castile. Recognizing that he had been misled by Henry, Pope Eugenius IV withdrew the Canaries bull that November.Pope Eugenius IV's Romani Pontifis (Nov 1436) recognizing Castile's claim is found in Monumenta Henricina, vol. 5, (p. 346) See also Russell, p. 164 Alfonso de Cartagena was not done. Eager to punish Henry for his impertinence, the Castilian diplomat submitted more claims ‚Äì urging the pope to restore several Portuguese bishoprics back under Compostela's jurisdiction, to revoke the autonomy of the Portuguese military orders (and fold them under the Castilian orders), to revoke the Tangier bull in light of Castile's 'right of conquest' over Morocco and even demanding the handover of Ceuta as rightfully Castilian (a point that had never been raised before).Russell, pp. 164‚Äì165 While it is probable that Cartagena was only half-serious, and sought merely to rattle Henry, the sudden splurge of Castilian claims nearly sank the Tangier expedition, and opened alarm at the prospect of a new war between Portugal and Castile.Russell, p. 165 The quarrel was still going strong through spring 1437. On April 30, Pope Eugenius IV issued the bull Dominatur Dominus revoking some portions of the prior September's Tangier bull, which might be interpreted as implicating the Castilian right of conquest.Bull Dominatur dominus (April 30, 1437) is reproduced in Monumenta Henricina, vol. VI, p.43 As late as May, Edward of Portugal was threatening to cancel the Tangier expedition and take arms against Castile to defend some controversial border parishes.The border parishes quarrel dates back to the great Western Schism when the Portuguese crown recognized the Roman Pope Urban VI and the Castilian crown the Avignon Antipope Clement VII. At the time, the spiritual jurisdiction of the Castilian dioceses of Tuy and Badajoz stretched over the Castilian-Portuguese political frontier to encompass some Portuguese parishes. In the 1380s, Castilian priests from Tuy and Badajoz, unwilling to follow the Castilian royal line on the Avignon antipope, crossed over the border and erected their own schismatic cathedral chapters for Tuy and Badajoz in the Portuguese towns of Valen√ßa (in Minho) and Oliven√ßa (then in Alentejo) respectively. This allowed them to maintain recognition of the Roman pope safely under the Portuguese king's protection. Although the schism was resolved, the rival cathedral chapters in Valen√ßa and Oliven√ßa continued to maintain themselves ‚Äì the Portuguese king was not eager to restore these parishes back under the jurisdiction of Castilian bishops. The quarrel was resolved in 1444 when Pope Eugenius IV formally deducted Valen√ßa and Oliven√ßa parishes from Tuy and Badajoz and assigned them to the Portuguese Bishop of Ceuta. Edward's letters to the Council of Basel and Rome, in April and May 1437, threatening war with Castile over them, are reproduced in Monumenta Henricina, vol. VI. However, the diplomatic quarrel calmed down and faded by early Summer 1437.Russell. p. 165 = Departure = In late summer 1437, after a year of preparation, the Portuguese expeditionary force was finally ready. The levies had been disappointing. Pina reports only some 6,000 Portuguese soldiers in all (3,000 knights, 2,000 infantry, 1,000 archers) ‚Äì that is, less than half of the 14,000 force anticipated.Pina, p. 96; Russell, p. 175; Quintella, p. 89 √Ålvares reports higher numbers ‚Äì 7,000 out of Lisbon, plus additions from Porto and Ceuta.√Ålvares, p. 55; Russell, p. 175 Nonetheless, the turnout was much lower than expected, in good part due on the unpopularity of the expedition, but there were problems with contracting transports abroad.Quintella, p. 89 The transport ships that showed up (mostly English and Basque)Russell, p. 175 were hardly enough to ferry even this reduced force. It is reported that some of the levies (as much as a quarter) had to be left behind in Lisbon.Russell, pp. 175‚Äì176 Nonetheless, it was decided to press forward, assuming the remainder would be eventually ferried when the missing transports arrived.Russell, p. 176 By King Edward's order, Prince Henry the Navigator was assigned overall command of the expedition, and was to sail with the troops from Lisbon. His experienced nephew Ferdinand (Count of Arraiolos) (who earlier pronounced himself against the expedition) was appointed constable of the nobles and sent to Porto to organize the embarcation of troops from northern Portugal. Among the other nobles participating in the enterprise were Henry's brother Ferdinand the Holy Prince (naturally), the marshal of the kingdom Vasco Fernandes Coutinho (future Count of Marialva) and the admiral of the sail fleet (capit√£o-mor da frota) √Ålvaro Vaz de Almada (future Count of Avranches). The prelate D. √Ålvaro de Abreu (Bishop of Evora) would go as papal legate.Quintella, pp. 86‚Äì87 The knights of Henry's Order of Christ and Ferdinand's Order of Aviz were ordered to follow their masters to North Africa. D. Fernando de Castro, governor of Henry's household, led the Henry's household knights and squires, while his relative and namesake D. Fernando de Castro 'o Cegonho', governor of Infante Ferdinand's household, led the latter's household knights.Monumenta Henricina, vol. 3, p. 69 On August 17, 1437, there was a solemn ceremony at the Lisbon Cathedral, where Henry received Edward's royal standard.Quintella, p. 87 After receiving their final instructions, the Lisbon fleet left the harbor of Bel√©m on August 22. = Morocco's defenses = Unlike at Ceuta in 1415, the Portuguese did not enjoy the element of surprise. The noisy diplomacy and lengthy preparations had given Moroccans, despite their political divisions, ample time to prepare the defenses of the targeted citadels. Fortifications were improved, garrisons were reinforced, and the mountain passes around Ceuta were sealed. Seeing this already in motion in 1436, the Ceuta commander D. Pedro de Menezes (Count of Vila Real) dispatched a detachment of his garrison under his son Duarte de Menezes to raid the Moroccan city of T√©touan to the south to prevent it from becoming a threat to future Portuguese operations.T√©touan had been razed by a Castilian force in 1399, and was recovering, See Julien, p. 195 but this did not seem to affect the strengthening of Moroccan defenses elsewhere. Tangier was under the command of the Marinid governor Salah ibn Salah (called √áallaben√ßalla by the Portuguese chronicles), the same man who had been governor of Ceuta back in 1415, now probably quite advanced in years, and probably eager for revenge.Russell, p. 178 (Salah ibn Salah was a Marinid vassal whose original dominions ranged along the northern coast, including Asilah, Tangier, and Ceuta). Salah ibn Salah counted on a garrison of about 7,000 men, including a contingent of crack sharpshooters imported from the Emirate of Granada.Quintella, p. 92 In the Marinid capital of Fez, the strongman Abu Zakariya Yahya al-Wattasi (called Lazeraque by the Portuguese chroniclers), the unpopular vizier of the young Marinid sultan Abd al-Haqq II (called Abdelac in the chronicles), launched an appeal for national unity and holy war to expel the Portuguese intruders. Although, for the past 15 years, Morocco had fragmented into virtually autonomous statelets ruled by rival regional governors, paying only lip service (if any) to the Marinid sultan, the governors answered Abu Zakariya's call. Troops from all corners of Morocco were set into motion, ready to place themselves at Fez's disposal to relieve Tangier and expel the infidel invaders.  Portuguese siege of Tangiers  = March from Ceuta = Henry's Lisbon fleet arrived in Ceuta on August 27, where they were greeted by the Ceuta garrison commander D. Pedro de Menezes (Count of Vila Real). The Porto fleet of Ferdinand of Arraiolos had arrived shortly before. A muster was held and commands assigned. Rather than wait for new transports to bring the troops that were left behind, Henry determined to continue with the ones he had. Topographic map of the region around Tangier and Ceuta (1954 map) The original plan was probably to proceed along the coast and seize Ksar es-Seghir, then Tangier and then Asilah in sequence, but this was quickly shelved. A scouting force sent out to examine the road to Ksar es- Seghir found strong resistance in the mountain passes leading to the city.Quintella, p. 89‚Äì90 As a result, Henry and his war council decided to side-step Ksar es-Seghir and aim for Tangier first. The army was split ‚Äì part of it would go by ship with Prince Ferdinand while the bulk would march overland under Henry's personal command. The overland column was to take a long circuitous loop, through the south via the ruins of T√©touan, then across the mountains and back up to Tangier.Quintella, p. 90 Henry's overland column left Ceuta on September 9 in nearly processional array. The vanguard was led by Ferdinand of Arraiolos. The right wing was led by D. Fernando de Castro (head of Henry's household), the left wing by his relative and namesake D. Fernando de Castro 'o Cegonho' (head of Ferdinand's household).Pina, p. 99 Henry himself led the center. D. Duarte de Menezes carried the royal standard in his father's place (Ceuta governor D. Pedro de Menezes was the alferes-mor, or official standard bearer of the realm, but had fallen ill at this time and was forced to remain behind.) Henry's personal standard was carried by Rui de Mello da Cunha. To inspire the troops, religious banners were unfurled bearing the images of the Virgin Mary, Christ as Crusader, the late King John I and the late beatified constable Nuno √Ålvares Pereira. The papal legate D.√Ålvaro de Abreu, Bishop of Evora, carried a piece of the True Cross, lent by Pope Eugenius IV for the occasion.Pina, p. 99; Russell, p. 177 The overland column did not meet any significant incidents, and arrived in the outskirts of Tangier on September 13. Ferdinand had already disembarked on a nearby beach (around Punta de los Judios). According to eyewitness Frei Jo√£o √Ålvares, Henry launched the first assault on Tangier on the very day he arrived,√Ålvares, p. 57 but chronicler Ruy de Pina reports the first assault was not launched until a week later.Pina, p. 111. For a new correlation of the Pina and √Ålvares timelines, and a critique of √Ålvares see Elbl, pp. 907‚Äì1020. Elbl, 2015, pp. 32‚Äì73, gives a long spatial analysis and tactical account of the approach, camp set-up, and many other issues, that differs greatly from the present article. (For this article, the dating and events largely follows Pina's account. The alternative timeline of √Ålvares will be summarized later.) According to Pina, the Portuguese spent about a week raising a fortified siege camp on a hill west of Tangier. In a decision that later proved fateful, Henry ordered that the palisade protecting the Portuguese siege camp encircle the camp completely. This went against King Edward's advice to ensure the palisade extended down to the beach to offer the Portuguese besiegers protected access to the anchored ships, but given the unpopularity of the expedition, Henry probably calculated it was necessary to deprive the reluctant Portuguese levies of the temptation for an easy retreat to the ships. Before departure, King Edward had given Henry explicit instructions to take the city by assault within the first week, and that if Tangier had not fallen after one week, the Portuguese expeditionary force was to withdraw and winter in Ceuta and wait until the Spring for further orders.Russell, p. 179 These instructions probably were given in light of the news of the mobilization of the Moroccan armies, knowing that the expeditionary force was inadequate to take on such an army in the field. There were also concerns about the lingering anchored fleet braving the worsening weather in the Straits of Gibraltar at this time of year. Henry would ignore these instructions. = First assault (September 20) = On September 20 (according to Ruy de Pina), Henry ordered the first assault on the city, attacking five points at the same time, with Henry personally leading one of the assault teams.Pina, p. 102; Quintella, p. 90; Russell, p. 178 By contrast, √Ålvares (pp. 57‚Äì59) asserts there were three failed assaults attempted on the city in this early period. See the alternative timeline below. A critique of √Ålvares is presented in Elbl, pp. 907‚Äì1020. For a very long alternative view of the action, see Elbl, 2015, pp. 73 ff. However, it quickly failed ‚Äì the scaling ladders were too few and, as it turns out, too short, to reach the top of the walls. The assaulters had to withdraw. Portuguese casualties amounted to some 20 dead and 500 wounded.Pina, p. 103 The artillery had proven too weak to do much damage. In the wake of the assault, Henry ordered larger ordnance cannon to be shipped in from Ceuta. It took at least another week before they arrived, eating up precious time that the Portuguese could ill-afford.Pina, p. 103; Quintella, p. 90; Russell, p. 179. Elbl, 2015, pp. 73‚Äì85, has a very different take on the events and technical aspects. Back in Ceuta, the illness of governor Pedro de Menezes had taken a turn for the worse. With Henry's permission, Duarte de Menezes rushed back to receive his father's blessing on his deathbed before he expired on September 22.Pina, p. 130 It was probably Duarte de Menezes who organized the forwarding of the artillery and supplies to Tangier and who was back at the siege shortly. = First relief army (September 30) = Soon after the first assault, the first Moroccan relief troops arrived in Tangiers. A column of 300 elite Portuguese knights was sent to intercept them, but they were swiftly swept aside. Some 50 Portuguese knights were reduced, and the rest barely escaped. The death of several leading nobles caused some consternation in the Portuguese camp.Pina, pp. 104‚Äì105; Quintella, p. 93. A more extensive and rather different interpretation is found in Elbl, 2015, pp. 86‚Äì87. On September 30, a larger Moroccan army appeared over the hills of Tangier. The Portuguese chroniclers, with probable exaggeration, claim it was composed of 10,000 horsemen and 90,000 footPina, (p. 105); Quintella, p. 93. √Ålvares goes further, suggesting 40,000 horse, 100,000 foot (p. 59). A letter dated October 3 by an anonymous soldier in Ferdinand de Arraiolos' army (reproduced in Monumenta Henricina, vol. 6, p. 208) reports the relief army as 6,000 horse and \\"innumberable\\" foot. Oddly, Russell (pp. 180‚Äì181) seems to suggest that the Fez strongman Abu Zakariya Yahya al-Wattasi came with this contingent, but almost all sources report him arriving with a later army. Henry moved his army to a hillside, offering battle, but the Moroccans just held their position in the valley. After three motionless hours, Henry ordered the Portuguese to march against them and force the issue, but the Moroccans just retreated back up the hills, evidently wishing to hold the higher ground. Seeing their motion, Henry called off the attack, and returned with his troops back to the siege lines.Pina, pp. 105‚Äì106; Quintella, p. 93 The next day (October 1), much the same maneuvers were repeated, with the same results.Pina, p. 106; Quintella, p. 93. For alternative discussion, see Elbl, 2015, pp. 89‚Äì92. On October 3, the dynamic changed slightly: The Moroccan army began a threatening march towards the siege lines.Pina, p. 107; Quintella, pp. 93‚Äì94 Henry quickly arrayed his troops in two lines. The Moroccans then suddenly halted. Henry seized the initiative and sent his stronger left wing, under Alvaro Vaz de Almada and Duarte de Menezes, to take a height on the Moroccan flank, and ordered his first line forward. Seeing the flanking maneuver, the Moroccans began to retreat. At that moment, the Tangier garrison burst out in a sortie against the siege camp, which was being held by a reserve force under Diogo Lopes de Sousa.Pina, p. 108; Quintella, p. 94 Evidently, the Moroccans had hoped Henry's line would break back to rescue the camp, but Sousa's reserves successfully repelled the sally by themselves.Quintella, p. 94. A very different tactical and spatial analysis from the one presented here is offered in Elbl, 2015, pp. 94‚Äì99. The height taken and the Portuguese line advancing unabated, the Moroccans called a retreat and broke the engagement. The Portuguese counted this encounter as a victory. Soldiers reported seeing the vision of a white cross appear in the sky that very evening.Pina, p. 109; Russell, p. 181 = Second assault (October 5) = Their morale restored, the Portuguese decided to proceed with a new assault on the city. Their scaling ladders were now extended, a new siege tower had been built and the two larger ordnance cannons shipped in from Ceuta were doing serious damage on the gates and walls of the city.Pina, p. 109; Quintella, p. 94 On October 5, Henry ordered the second assault. Henry led the assault force, leaving the rest of the troops under Ferdinand the Holy, Ferdinand of Arraiolos and Bishop √Ålvaro of Evora, to defend their flanks and keep the Moroccan relief army at bay, but the second assault failed as badly as the first. The city's defenders rushed to the critical points, and poured on rapid and heavy missile fire. The Portuguese assaulters were prevented from reaching the walls (only one ladder managed to be set up ‚Äì and was promptly destroyed).Pina, pp. 109‚Äì110; Quintella, pp. 94‚Äì95. An extensive dissenting analysis that looks at the events quite differently is offered in Elbl, 2015, pp. 100‚Äì107.  Moroccan turnaround  = Second relief army (October 9) = On October 9, Henry was preparing his third assault when he received intelligence of a new massive Moroccan relief army ‚Äì reported (with doubtless exaggeration) to be some 60,000 horse and 700,000 foot.According to Ruy de Pina, (p. 111), Quintella, p. 95. Frei Jo√£o √Ålvares, pp. 60‚Äì61, reports 96,000 horse, 600,000 foot. Beazley (p. 184) says \\"100,000 horse; their infantry beyond count\\". This massive army was led by Abu Zakariya Yahya al-Wattasi (Lazeraque), the vizier of the Marinid sultan Abd al-Haqq II of Fez (whom the chroniclers suggest was present). The chroniclers report the army was composed of \\"many kings\\" (Fez, Marrakesh, Sijilmassa, Velez, etc.). The Tangier relief campaign was probably the first time since 1419 that a unified army from all of Morocco had been assembled. Prince Henry realized the Portuguese were hopelessly outnumbered, that the siege was lost and the best they could do was to fight an orderly rearguard action back to the ships. All the seamen were ordered to prepare sail, and the army was arrayed to defend a retreat of the assault force to the fortified siege camp lines.Pina, p. 111; Quintella, pp. 94‚Äì95 The marshal Coutinho was given command of the artillery, the admiral Almada took the infantry, and Henry took command of the cavalry.Pina, p. 111; Beazely, p. 184. An alternative analysis is in Elbl, 2015, pp. 108 ff. The arriving Moroccan army did not pause but attacked at once. The Portuguese advance posts quickly were overwhelmed, and the way to the city cleared. The Moroccans then charged the Portuguese forces. The artillery batteries were overrun and taken.Pina, p. 112; for a new dissenting analysis that refines and contests the standard narrative, see Elbl, pp. 294‚Äì299; Elbl, 2015, pp. 110‚Äì112. The Moroccan charge then turned on Henry's cavalry ‚Äì which broke and beat a retreat to the siege camp line. Henry's horse was killed from under him, effectively disabling his ability to survey the field and organize the retreat. It is said that Henry was alone on foot for a while, surrounded by Moroccan cavalry, and saved only by the heroics and personal sacrifice of Fern√£o Alvares Cabral and a group of his guards who rushed in to extract him.Pina, pp. 112‚Äì113; Quintella, p. 95; Beazley, p. 184; for a new critical analysis, see Elbl, pp. 294‚Äì299 The retreat nearly turned into a rout when about 1,000 of the Portuguese soldiers, nobles among them, abandoned the siege line and fled in panic to the beach to make for the ships.Pina, p. 113; Quintella, p. 95 It was only by the furious fighting of those remaining on the palisade that the Moroccan army did not manage to overwhelm and take the siege camp that day.Quintella, p. 95 The battle was broken by evening. The Moroccan army encircled and settled to a siege of the Portuguese siege camp. = Siege of the Portuguese camp = Overnight, the Portuguese besiegers, now besieged, set about repairing and strengthening the defenses of the siege camp.Pina, p. 114 The next day, the Moroccans launched another assault on the siege camp, but were repelled after a heavy four-hour fight.Pina, p. 117; Alvares, pp. 60‚Äì61; Quintella, p. 95 Chronicler Frei Jo√£o √Ålvares reports that at this point, the Portuguese expeditionary force in the siege camp was a mere 3,000, implying that of the original 7,000 who arrived at Tangier, 4,000 or so had died or deserted.√Ålvares, p. 62; also Russell, p. 181. The anonymous soldier's letter reports 3,000 on October 3 (Monumenta Henricina, vol. 6, p. 208), if true, and if the mass desertion of 1,000 happened as the chroniclers reported it, then the camp would be reduced to as few as 2,000. Elbl, 2015, 93‚Äì100 emphatically argues against this entire interpretation. The Portuguese camp was certainly in a desperate situation, with only a day or so worth of food left. When these ran out, Henry resolved on a night operation to breach the Moroccan lines and force his army's passage to the beach and the idling ships. However, this operation was detected before it even began (Pina says it was revealed by the treason of Henry's own chaplain, Martim Vieira, who had turned over to the Marinids). The Moroccans reinforced the posts guarding the paths to the sea, cutting off all hope of escape for the Portuguese army.Pina, p. 118; Quintella, p. 96 = Truce and negotiations (October 12) = What happened next is a bit more contested. Chronicler Ruy de Pina reports that, on October 12, having taken many casualties, Abu Zakariya called off further assaults on the camp and decided to open communications to the Portuguese defenders, offering to make peace in return for Ceuta.Pina, p. 119 But Frei Jo√£o √Ålvares contradicts this, and reports it was the Portuguese who initiated the offer through secret emissaries already on the first day.√Ålvares p. 63. See also Russell, p. 181 √Ålvares reports this offer made no impression on the Moroccans at first. It is true the assaults were suspended on October 11, but that was also a Friday, the Muslim holy day (jumu'ah). It was only during this interlude that Abu Zakariya decided to consider the Portuguese offer, and a truce was called for Saturday, October 12. The talks were conducted by Portuguese emissary Rui Gomes da Silva, alcaide of Campo Maior, and for the Moroccan side, by Salah ibn Salah, emir of Tangier.Pina, pp. 120‚Äì21 There was dissent on what terms to offer. Pina suggests that some of the Moroccan commanders, upset at how the negotiations were being conducted on their behalf, withdrew from the truce. The renegades launched an assault on the Portuguese siege camp that Saturday that lasted seven hours.Pina, pp. 121‚Äì23; Quintella, p. 96 After that assault, Henry took account of the desperate conditions in the Portuguese camp. The army was starving, horses and beasts of burden were eaten. Thirst also began taking its deadly toll ‚Äì the siege camp contained but a single small well, sufficient to slake only about one hundred men per day.Pina, p. 124; Quintella, p. 96 With so many wounded and weakened, Henry did not have enough men to garrison the full length of the stockade. With the tacit permission of the Moroccan leaders, in an overnight operation on Saturday evening, Henry had his men reduce the circumference of the siege camp (and shift it slightly closer to the sea), allowing the Portuguese to defend themselves more effectively against renegade skirmishers.Pina, pp. 123‚Äì24; Quintella, p. 96. For a spatial interpretation that alters the current account see Elbl, 2015, pp. 110‚Äì132. There were no more assaults on the Portuguese siege camp. The truce was observed from Sunday, October 13 onward. = The treaty (October 16‚Äì17) = The treaty was concluded on Wednesday, October 16, and signed the next day (October 17) by Prince Henry and Salah ibn Salah.Pina, pp. 124‚Äì125. A copy of the treaty of October 17, 1437 is preserved and found in Monumenta Henricina, Vol. VI, p. 211 The Moroccans allowed the Portuguese army to withdraw to their ships unmolested, but they were to leave behind all artillery, weapons, baggage, tents and horses. The Portuguese soldiers were to go empty-handed, taking only the clothes they were wearing. Most crucially, Henry promised to deliver Ceuta to the Marinids ‚Äì to withdraw the Portuguese garrison and leave behind any and all Moroccan prisoners that were held there.See Monumenta Henricina, Vol. VI, p. 211; also Quintella, p. 96, Russell, pp. 182‚Äì183. Elbl, 2015, pp. 123‚Äì129, offers a different angle. He also committed Portugal to 100 years of peace with Morocco and other Muslim states in North Africa. To ensure the safe evacuation of Portuguese soldiers to their ships, hostages were swapped ‚Äì the Tangier governor Salah ibn Salah handed over his son to the Portuguese in return for a group of four noble Portuguese hostages (identified as Pedro de Ata√≠de, Jo√£o Gomes de Avelar, Aires da Cunha and Gomes da Cunha).Pina, p. 125; Monumenta Henricina, Vol. VI, p. 211; Quintella, p. 97; Russell, p. 183 As security for the final fulfillment of the treaty terms, Henry's brother, Ferdinand the Holy Prince, was to remain behind in Morocco, as a hostage of Salah ibn Salah, until Ceuta was delivered. Pina claims that Henry refused this condition, and offered himself in his brother's place, but that the others in his council would not allow it.Pina, p. 125; Quintella, p. 97. However, Russell, pp. 183‚Äì84 doubts this. Elbl, 2015, pp. 121‚Äì123, provides extensive details and a new interpretation. Upon being delivered to Salah ibn Salah, the noble hostage Prince Ferdinand the Holy and his small entourage of servants, which included the secretary Frei Jo√£o √Ålvares, =immediately was dispatched under Salah ibn Salah's guard to Asilah. Portuguese chroniclers report that at the very final stage, some renegade Moroccans attacked the embarking Portuguese on the beach ‚Äì killing an additional forty.Quintella, p. 97 However, the skirmish probably was provoked by Portuguese soldiers trying to smuggle some of the forbidden weapons with them.Russell, pp. 184‚Äì185. Elbl, 2015, pp. 123‚Äì129, gives a very different interpretation of the episode. Nonetheless, this beach skirmish later provided the excuse that the Moroccans had broken the treaty first, thus rendering it void.Russell, p.185 By October 19, the troops were all aboard, and the ships set sail. It is said that the honor of being the last men to leave the beach was shared between the admiral √Ålvaro Vaz de Almada and the marshal Vasco Fernandes Coutinho. After the embarcation was complete, Henry decided not to release Salah ibn Salah's son (as he was supposed to).Pina, p. 130; Russell, p. 187 As a result, Salah ibn Salah also held on to his four noble hostages, and dispatched them under arms to Asilah. In all, the siege of Tangiers lasted 37 days ‚Äì 25 days with the Portuguese besieging Tangiers, 12 days with the Moroccans besieging the Portuguese camp. It is said that Portuguese casualties numbered 500 dead and unknown number injured.Pina, p. 130; Quintella, p. 97 Moroccan casualties are unknown.  Alternative timeline  The timeline and events proposed above follows that reported by royal chronicler Ruy de Pina. However, Frei Jo√£o √Ålvares, who was an eyewitness to the battle, places the dates and events on a somewhat different timeline.√Ålvares's alternative timeline is summarized by the editors of Monumenta Henricina, vol. VI, p. 212. For detailed critique and rejection of this timeline see Elbl, 2015. √Ålvares reports that Tangier was assaulted immediately on the first day the expeditionary force arrived (September 13), a second assault within a couple of days (September 14 or September 15). The first attack by a Moroccan relief army is placed on September 16, another the next day (September 17), before the larger set piece encounter in the valley and the sally by the Tangier garrison (September 19).On this, √Ålvares's dating contradicts the October 3rd letter by the anonymous soldier of Arraiolos section, whose timing of the valley fight coincides with Pina's (October 1 to October 3). (see Monumenta Henricina, vol. 6, p. 208). The timing is re- examined, and the action analyzed in a fundamentally different way in Elbl, 2015. √Ålvares reports a third failed assault (Pina's second) on Tangier on September 20. The arrival of Abu Zakariya's army and the battle of Tangiers is dated on September 25. The second Moroccan assault on the siege camp on September 26, and the first emissaries sent by the Portuguese to the Marinid camp right after. The seven-hour assault of the siege camp is dated September 28, with the opening of talks in the aftermath. Two more Moroccan assaults (October 1 and October 3) are reported before the truce finally holds. The finalization of the agreement and swapping of the hostages occurs on October 16 and signing of treaty on October 17. It is worth remarking that both chroniclers seem to agree that one week elapsed between Abu Zakariya's arrival and the truce and opening of talks. Where √Ålvares differs most significantly is in suggesting that talks dragged out for another two weeks. Unless the Moroccans allowed the entry of supplies into the siege camp during that interlude, the conditions in the Portuguese siege camp at the end must have been quite dire.  Aftermath  Prince Henry the Navigator did not return to Lisbon to report to his brother, King Edward of Portugal, but rather sailed directly to Ceuta.Pina, p. 130; Russell, p. 185 Henry assigned D. Fernando de Castro the duty of bringing his troops home and giving the account of the expedition and its defeat. In Ceuta, Henry barricaded himself in his lodgings for several weeks, with hardly a word to anyone ‚Äì evidently, Henry had fallen into a deep depression.Russell, pp. 185‚Äì87 The new Portuguese governor of Ceuta, Fernando de Noronha, who had been appointed to succeed his father-in- law, the late Pedro de Menezes, arrived in Ceuta around this time. He must have been surprised to hear that a treaty had been signed to evacuate the garrison he had just been appointed to command. With Henry ensconced in his room, not speaking to anyone, Noronha was not sure how to proceed. News soon reached Portugal. A little earlier, sometime in September, the constable John of Reguengos had traveled to the southern province of the Algarve to raise more troops and organize the dispatch of reinforcements and supplies to Henry in Tangier. Being in the south, John was among the first people in the country to hear of the turn-around in Tangier, and the encirclement of the Portuguese camp. John of Reguengos immediately set sail for Africa with all the ships, men and supplies he had at hand. However, strong contrary winds prevented John's flotilla from reaching Tangier. At length, hearing of the capitulation of the Portuguese camp, John changed direction and headed to the Moroccan port of Asilah. There, John entered into frantic negotiations with Salah ibn Salah's officials, hoping to secure the release of his younger brother Ferdinand, but to no avail.Pina, p. 132; Quintella, p. 98 John returned to Portugal empty-handed. King Edward of Portugal received the news of the turn- around on October 19, at his residence in Santar√©m.Pina, p. 131; Quintella, p. 97 Peter of Coimbra, then in Lisbon, received the news around the same time, and immediately set about assembling an armada to rescue his brothers. However, Peter was still in Lisbon when the advance ships of the returning fleet arrived in Lisbon harbor with the news of the Portuguese capitulation and treaty. After the initial shock, the question of what to do was posed immediately. The quandary would become the anvil of the √çnclita Gera√ß√£o. The princely brothers had been made knights when their father captured Ceuta back in 1415. And they now looked to be undone by it. Peter of Coimbra and John of Reguengos, who had both long argued for abandoning Ceuta, had no doubt on what the course of action should be: fulfill the treaty and evacuate Ceuta. King Edward had enough powers to order it, but was caught in indecision. After a prolonged silence, Henry eventually dispatched a letter from Ceuta to Edward, arguing against fulfilling the treaty he had signed. Henry noted that the skirmish on the beach exempted the Portuguese from fulfilling the agreement, and proposed instead that perhaps they could swap Salah ibn Salah's son (still being held by Henry) for Prince Ferdinand.Russell, pp. 186‚Äì187 However, Edward received a note from the captive Ferdinand at the same time, reporting that the Marinids would accept nothing less than Ceuta, and wondering why it had not been evacuated yet.Russell, p. 187 It is clear from these letters, that, contrary to later legend (propagated by Henry himselfRussell, p. 192), Ferdinand did not seek a martyr's fate, that he expected the treaty to be fulfilled and to be swiftly released.Pina, p. 139; Russell, p. 187 = Cortes of Leiria = Uncertain of what to do, King Edward of Portugal summoned the Portuguese Cortes to Leiria in January, 1438 for consultation. Henry did not attend the summons, but remained in Ceuta.Pina, p. 136 The Cortes of Leiria opened on January 25. Before the Cortes, King Edward (via a spokesman) openly blamed Henry's neglect of his military instructions for the debacle at Tangier.Pina, p. 138; Russell, pp. 187‚Äì8. An alternative record of the proceedings of the Cortes are set down in a letter dated February 25, 1438 to Diogo Gomes in Florence, reproduced in Monumenta Henricina, Vol. VI, p. 223 But there was no getting away from the fact that Edward had authorized the expedition himself, against the advice of others, including the Cortes itself. A letter from the captive Ferdinand was read before the Cortes. The letter urged the fulfillment of the treaty, expressing Ferdinand's desire to be released and outlining why holding on to Ceuta served Portugal little purpose.Pina, p. 139 Once again, Pedro of Coimbra and John of Reguengos, who had opposed the expedition from the start, urged the Cortes to ratify the treaty and surrender Ceuta immediately.Pina, p. 140; Russell, p. 188 The prelates agreed ‚Äì although the Archbishop of Braga added that the Pope's approval should also be sought. Most of the burghers also agreed ‚Äì save for those of the major commercial port cities of Lisbon, Porto and Lagos, who felt that the release of a prince was too small a reward for so important a city, and that perhaps the treaty could be renegotiated.Russell, p. 188; See also the letter to Diogo Gomes in MH, vol. VI: pp. 224‚Äì25 Ultimately, it was the noble magnates that sank the proposal. Rallied by Ferdinand of Arraiolos, the constable who had led the nobles at Tangier (although he earlier opposed the expedition), the Portuguese nobles opposed the swap altogether.Pina, p. 141; Russell, p. 188 Arraiolos argued fervently that reneging the treaty was no dishonor because it had been signed under duress. The Cortes was dissolved without a decision being made. In June, no longer able to resist his brother's summons, Prince Henry left Ceuta and returned to Portugal, but he requested exemption from presenting himself in the king's court in Evora.Russell, p. 189 King Edward met in him at a private conference in Portel. It was probably there that the decision to hold on to Ceuta was definitively made. Henry proposed alternative schemes to secure Ferdinand's release ‚Äì ransoming for money, persuading Castile and Aragon to join in a mass release of Muslim prisoners, raising a new army and invading Morocco again, etc.Russell, pp. 189‚Äì190 Henry proposed a myriad of schemes to release Ferdinand, but delivering Ceuta was not one of them. In May, citing six months of foot- dragging, Abu Zakariya Yahya al-Wattasi, vizier of the Marinid palace in Fez, took charge of the noble hostage from Salah ibn Salah, and ordered Ferdinand transferred from his comfortable quarters in Asilah to a common jail in Fez.Rusell, p. 190 There, Ferdinand's status was downgraded, and he was subjected to humiliating ordeals by his captors, including being kept in chains for prolonged periods. According to the chronicler Frei Jo√£o √Ålvares (who was there with him), Ferdinand bore the humiliations with stoic resilience. = Castro Mission, 1440‚Äì1441 = King Edward of Portugal died in August (of pestilence, said his doctors; of heartbreak over the hapless fate of Ferdinand, said popular lore).Russell, p. 191 Edward's death provoked an internal conflict in Portugal over the regency for his young son, the new king Afonso V of Portugal, and the kingdom became distracted. At length, the upper hand was gained by Edward's brother, Peter of Coimbra, who became regent of Portugal in 1439. The fulfillment of the treaty was among the new regent's first orders of business. Peter of Coimbra immediately dispatched two emissaries, Martim Tavora and Gomes Eanes, to Asilah to negotiate the logistics of the swap of Ceuta for Ferdinand. In theory, Ferdinand was Salah ibn Salah's hostage, even though he was de facto in Fez, in the custody of Abu Zakariya. Salah recently died and his brother (whom the chroniclers call Muley Buquer ‚Äì Abu Bakr?) had succeeded him as governor of Tangier and Asilah (Salah's son was then still in Portuguese captivity).Ruy de Pina, Chronica de D. Afonso V p. 109 It was Muley Buquer who put the preliminary conditions for the swap ‚Äì firstly, that the Ceuta governor Fernando de Noronha must be relieved from office (his reputation was such that the Moroccans believed he would contrive to prevent the swap), and that upon fulfillment of that, Muley Buquer would request from Abu Zakariya the transfer of Ferdinand from Fez back to Asilah.Pina, Chr. Afonso V, pp. 109‚Äì110 How exactly it would proceed from there is unclear, but presumably the swap would follow. Receiving the report, Peter of Coimbra appointed D. Fernando de Castro (the head of Henry's household and an experienced diplomat) in charge of the operation. In April 1440 (sometimes dated as 1441),Chroniclers Ruy de Pina (Chr. D. Afonso V, p. 111) and Frei Jo√£o √Ålvares (p. 184) date the expedition in late March or early April 1441. However, reviewing other evidence, the 1965 editors of the Monumenta Henricina, Vol 6, p. 176n suggest the expedition was more likely a year earlier, in April 1440. Castro set out with a Portuguese flotilla to Ceuta, to take over the city from the governor Fernando de Noronha, and begin the evacuation of the Portuguese garrison and the handover to the Marinids. In the meantime, the embassy of Martim de Tavora and Gomes Eanes was to return to Asilah to receive the released Prince Ferdinand from the Moroccans. The operation started out inauspiciously. The flotilla went out in a celebratory mood ‚Äì the ambitious Fernando de Castro openly fantasized that the released Infante Ferdinand might be persuaded to marry his own daughter on the spot, and prepared a rich and well-stocked expedition, packing the ships with banquet finery, an entourage of notables, and a bodyguard of some 1,200 troops, but on the outward journey, around Cape Saint Vincent, the Portuguese flotilla was ambushed by Genoese pirates. The lead ship was boarded and Fernando de Castro killed before the other ships could reach him. The pirates scampered away (suspicions that Noronha may have had a hand in directing the Genoese pirates to sabotage the mission have not been ruled out). Hearing the news, Peter of Coimbra hurriedly dispatched instructions to Castro's son, √Ålvaro de Castro, to take over his father's credentials and fulfill the mission. In the meantime, Tavora and Eanes arrived in Asilah. The elder Castro's death led to a little confusion, but once it was clarified that Noronha was relieved, the transfer request was forwarded by Muley Buquer to Fez. Tavora and Eanes sent their own representative, a Portuguese Jew known only as Mestre Jos√© (Master Joseph), to accompany the request and presumably escort Ferdinand back to Asilah.√Ålvares, p. 185; the emissary's name is given in Monumenta Henricina, vol. VI, p. 176n Arriving in Fez in May, the emissaries presented the vizier Abu Zakariya with sealed letters from Peter of Coimbra confirming Noronha's dismissal and a copy of the royal instructions given to Castro to evacuate Ceuta. However, Abu Zakariya refused to assent to the transfer request. Instead, the vizier replied that Ferdinand would remain in Fez and that he would fulfill the swap once Ceuta was evacuated.Pina, Chr. Afonso V, p. 112 What followed is a bit murky. Master Joseph was accused (and confessed to) being part of a scheme to help Ferdinand escape, and was arrested and thrown into a cell.√Ålvares, p. 188 The detention of Master Joseph (which lasted until September) gave Abu Zakariya time to assemble a Moroccan army for a triumphal march to Ceuta, intending to garrison the citadel as soon as it was evacuated. Abu Zakariaya set out in processional array from Fez, taking Ferdinand along with him, promising to hand him over as soon as he took possession of the city. Master Joseph was released and sent back to Asilah to report the change of plans to Tavora and Eanes. It is uncertain what else the emissary reported about Abu Zakariya's intentions, but the Portuguese ambassadors rejected the offer, arguing they were not prepared to \\"hock Ceuta for paper promises\\",√Ålvares, p. 193 that they needed to have some sort of hold on Ferdinand's person. Abu Zakariya called off the march and returned to Fez. (Reports of the mobilization of Moroccan arms for the march to Ceuta caused alarm in Portugal, which feared that Abu Zakariya might try to take Ceuta by force. In late 1440, an armed Portuguese fleet was hurriedly dispatched to reinforce Ceuta.Monumenta Henricina, Vol. 6, p. 176n It is uncertain if they actually arrived there, but if they did, the disembarkation of fresh troops likely sent mixed signals to Fez about Portuguese intentions.) Negotiations resumed, this time swirling around potential hostage-swapping and material guarantees to supplement verbal promises. However, there was little trust between the parties. The Portuguese failure to fulfill the treaty promptly in 1437, and Henry's failure to return Salah ibn Salah's son after the evacuation from the beach, essentially undermined any new Portuguese offers. Abu Zakariya knew that Ferdinand was his only trump, that he was the only reason the Portuguese negotiators were there (and barely so). Abu Zakariya would not, could not, release Ferdinand until Ceuta was safely in his hands. On the other hand, back in Ceuta, the young and inexperienced √Ålvaro de Castro, surrounded by suspicious captains and veteran soldiers, could not simply hand over the entire city to the Marinids for anything less than Ferdinand. In late October- early November, the Nasrid sultan Muhammad IX of Granada stepped in and offered to break the impasse. He proposed that Ferdinand be placed in the hands of a group of Genoese merchants under his protection, giving his solemn promise to Abu Zakariya he would not allow them to hand Ferdinand over to the Portuguese until the evacuation of the city was confirmed.√Ålvares, p. 196 The Portuguese did not give an immediate reply to Granada's offer, and an outbreak of pestilence in Morocco delayed matters further.√Ålvares, p. 198ff. Three of the noble beach hostages, then being held in Asilah (separately from Ferdinand in Fez), Jo√£o Gomes de Avelar, Pedro de Ata√≠de and Aires da Cunha, died of the plague at this time.√Ålvares, pp. 203, 207 By September, disappointing news arrived of the breakdown of Granada's offer and Ferdinand was once again chained.√Ålvares, p. 229 = Death of the prince = Whatever hope remained for a peaceful solution was dashed in March 1442. According to √Ålvares,√Ålvares, Ch. 31, p. 230 that month, a certain Moroccan noble (identified by √Ålvares as Faquyamar, a tutor of a Marinid prince) was arrested by Abu Zakariya's men, and on his person were found several Portuguese letters, originating from Queen Eleanor's council, outlining a hare-brained scheme to break Ferdinand out of jail.Alvares, p. 231 The Moroccan noble was flogged and executed in Ferdinand's presence, and Ferdinand moved to isolation in a dank dungeon in Fez. It was now clear to Abu Zakariya that the Portuguese had no intention to yield Ceuta, that nothing remained to do with Ferdinand but to extract the largest cash ransom that he could get,√Ålvares, p. 232 but nothing came of this. After 15 months of captivity in the worst conditions, Ferdinand died on June 5, 1443, aged 41.√Ålvares, p. 346 Several of the remaining members of Ferdinand's entourage, including the secretary Frei Jo√£o √Ålvares, were ransomed back to Portugal in subsequent years.According to Alvares (p. 347), of Ferdinand's captive entourage of nine household servants, four were ransomed and returned (secretary Frei Jo√£o √Ålvares and head cook Jo√£o Vaz in 1448, chaplain P√™ro Vaz and the prince's foster-brother Jo√£o Rodrigues in 1450), while five remained in Morocco, some as Muslim converts (physician Mestre Martinho, wardrobe master Fern√£o Gil, harbinger/steward Jo√£o Louren√ßo, cup-bearer/butler Jo√£o de Luna and oven-master Christov√£o Alem√£o) In his official chronicle, Ruy de Pina makes no mention of the noble or the escape plan, and suggests the negotiations broke down simply because Abu Zakariya had little interest in recovering Ceuta, that the Portuguese presence in Ceuta served Abu Zakariya as a useful political distraction for the Moroccan population, allowing the Wattasid vizier to consolidate his power domestically.Ruy de Pina, Chr. D. Afonso V, pp. 112‚Äì13  Legacy  = Portugal = The debacle at Tangier and the captivity and death of Prince Ferdinand have loomed large in popular Portuguese memory, albeit inconsistently. It was a tremendous blow to the reputation of Prince Henry the Navigator. However, Henry managed to deflect attention from his role by encouraging the popular saintly cult of Ferdinand as a national martyr, a 'Saint Prince' or 'Holy Prince' (Infante Santo, although he was never beatified by the Catholic Church) who 'voluntarily' submitted to scourge and death for Portugal's imperial mission rather than a victim of Henry's military pretensions and blunders.Russell, pp. 192‚Äì95 Henry commissioned Frei Jo√£o √Ålvares to compose the chronicle of Ferdinand's imprisonment as a piece of Christian hagiography (although √Ålvares does not quite endorse the Henrican interpretation of events). Nonetheless, Henry's interpretation gained currency in later years, particularly as Henry's reputation ascended retrospectively with the glorification of the Age of Discovery, and the blemish of Tangier needed to be scrubbed. It was known, from the Leiria Cortes, where blame for the debacle at Tangier lay, and what Ferdinand's hopes had been. Henry's opposition to the fulfillment of the treaty was also well-known. Henry's dubious role in the 1438 regency crisis and the later 1449 Battle of Alfarrobeira fostered a significant popular feeling in Portugal at the time that Henry was something of a dynastic traitor, with a pattern of betraying his brothers for personal gain, for which Tangier and its aftermath were cited as early examples. The Saint Vincent Panels, painted by Nuno Gon√ßalves around this time, is believed by some art historians to represent such a political statement, a funerary homage to Ferdinand the Holy Prince, pointing an accusatory finger at Henry the Navigator. = Morocco = The victory of Tangier dramatically changed the political fortunes of the unpopular Abu Zakariya Yahya al-Wattasi, vizier of the Marinid palace of Fez and regent for sultan Abd al-Haqq II. Hailed as a national hero, Abu Zakariya was quick to milk the victory for all it was worth. Any question of surrendering the regency was set aside, regional governors returned to the fold. The chaos and disorder of the last two decades came to an abrupt end, and Morocco enjoyed a bit of a springtime in the aftermath.Julien, pp. 196‚Äì98 The ear of his victory, Abu Zakariya launched the construction of the Zaouia Moulay Idriss II in Fez, a magnificent mausoleum for the recently discovered uncorrupted remains of the Idris II (the sultan who founded the Idrisid dynasty back in 807).Julien, p. 198 But the mausoleum also served unmistakably as a monument to Abu Zakariya and his triumph in Tangier. Although Abu Zakariya did not recover Ceuta, the victory at Tangier was instrumental in the ascent of the Wattasid viziers and their eventual eclipse of the Marinid sultans in whose name they ruled. = Later campaigns = Whatever the attitude toward Henry or the objective merits of remaining in Ceuta, the death of Ferdinand certainly sealed Portugal's hold on the city. A high price had been paid for it, and the question of abandoning Ceuta was shelved permanently . In fact, it gave an impetus to new Portuguese expansionism in Morocco, now tinged with an element of revenge. The memory of the Holy Prince was cited by King Afonso V of Portugal in launching the 1458 expedition to seize Tangier ‚Äì although it was deviated, and ended up seizing Ksar es-Seghir (Alc√°cer-Ceguer) instead. A third attempt to take Tangier was launched in late 1463, which also failed. Finally, on the fourth attempt, Tangier fell to the Portuguese in August 1471.  References   Sources  Almost all accounts of the Battle of Tangier rely heavily on two Portuguese chronicles: the official Chronica d'el Rey D. Duarte, written by Ruy de Pina in the 1510s (probably on the basis of drafts originally prepared by Gomes Eanes de Zurara), and the Chronica do Infante Santo D.

On 9 February 1597 he was elected a scholar of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, and in 1603, shortly after he had taken his degree of B.A., he became the first fellow of Balliol College under the bequest of Peter Blundell. After remaining for several years at the university he returned to his native county, where he obtained the vicarage of Heavitree and a canonry in Exeter Cathedral, his collation to the latter preferment dating 20 March 1637. A few years later he resigned his benefice in favour of a relation, and accepted the rectory of Widworthy in the same county. The latter preferment he retained until his death, and after the Restoration (2 March 1662) the rectory of St. Mary Major, Exeter, was conferred upon him. He died on 5 July 1667, and was buried in the middle area of Exeter Cathedral. Works and legacy The presentment of Bury and the other prebendaries at William Laud's visitation, 19 June 1634, is printed in Hist. MSS. Comm. 4th Rep. p. 138. His literary works were few in number: two sermons (1615 and 1631) and a catechism for the use of his parishioners at Widworthy (1661). He endowed a school in St. Sidwell's, Exeter, left funds for the maintenance of thirteen poor persons in St. Catherine's Almshouse in the same city and for the poor of his native town of Tiverton, and largely added to the resources of the public workhouse at St. Sidwell's.

Personal life Peckinpaugh was born in Muncie, Indiana and grew up in Canton, Ohio. Her father was a small business owner. She had a brief marriage during college that ended in divorce. Janet married Elliot Gerson in 1987 and their son, Alex was born in 1988. That marriage ended in divorce in 1993. Television career After college Peckinpaugh worked briefly for National Airlines. She moved to Washington, D.C. and was a staffer for Senator Richard Stone (D) FL before starting her television career. In 1978 she moved to Richmond, VA and started her career at WWBT-TV as a weather anchor and news reporter. In 1981, she crossed the street to work at WXEX as a co-anchor. Three months later the other stations in the market also had female co-anchors and all the on-air people had contracts. Peckinpaugh's agent Ken Lindner landed a job for her at WTNH in 1984. News of her arrival made it to the front page of The Hartford Courant, and she quickly became a popular figure in Connecticut and in television. In 1987, Peckinpaugh moved to Channel 3 WFSB, based in Hartford. She was a successful evening news anchor with a six figure salary. In 1995, Peckinpaugh's contract was breached when she was taken off the 6pm news. She left at the end of her contract and filed a discrimination lawsuit for breach of contract, oral and written, sex discrimination (her news director said two women could not anchor together when he took her off both the noon and 5:30 news with Gayle King in 1995 and replaced her with a much younger man) and age discrimination. Peckinpaugh won the multimillion-dollar lawsuit against the Washington Post Company on all counts except age discrimination. Peckinpaugh worked as an anchor for WVIT from 1995 until her retirement in December, 2006. Peckinpaugh is still regarded as a popular figure and is said to have been one of the most well-known TV anchors in Connecticut, with name recognition somewhere between 80 and 90 percent in Connecticut. During her career, she interviewed four U.S. presidents. Post-television career After leaving NBC, Peckinpaugh started a media marketing business in Essex, CT. The business, Peckinpaugh Media Group, was designed to advise, guide, and create media productions, such as commercials, for various businesses. She is also a realtor with William Pitt Sotheby's International Realty in Essex, and writes a weekly real estate column for the Shoreline Times. Peckinpaugh served as the marketing director for her friend Lisa Wilson-Foley‚Äôs LW Holdings. =Political career= In the early months of 2010 Peckinpaugh took an interest in politics when her good friend, Wilson-Foley, decided to run for Lieutenant Governor. Peckinpaugh was her campaign manager through the Republican Convention. She entered the political arena herself as a candidate for Congress from the 2nd district just a few weeks before the Convention but picked up enough votes to wage a primary. Peckinpaugh is a fiscal conservative and social moderate. Until the August primary, Peckinpaugh focused on meeting voters, raising money, and visiting all of the towns in the district. She quickly became a popular Republican candidate. On August 10, she defeated Daria Novak and Doug Dubitsky to become the Republican nominee. She was the only political candidate in Connecticut to beat the party-endorsed candidate. Following the primary, she went on to challenge the two-term incumbent, Democrat Joe Courtney. She continued to travel the district and meet voters and raised a quarter of a million dollars in six months but it was not enough to wage battle with the incumbent who had $1.4M to spend against her. The two frequently debated and sparred, and both had support from different groups. However, given the strong Democratic tendencies of the state's 2nd district, Peckinpaugh picked up 40% of the vote on November 2. In January 2011, she declared her candidacy for the Connecticut House of Representatives to fill a vacancy in a February special election. The seat she ran for had been vacated by Democrat Jamie Spallone. She ran a very strong campaign against Essex four term, first selectman Phil Miller, and lost by 80 votes. Charitable work Peckinpaugh has always been very active in charities in Connecticut. She currently serves on the board of directors for the Girl Scouts of Connecticut Girl Scouts, the CT Women's Hall of Fame and the Hartford Art School at the University of Hartford. She has been a corporator for Children's Hospital and was a fellow for Calhoun College at Yale University. Currently she is the Chair of the Economic Development Commission for Essex and is on the Board of Governors at the Essex Yacht Club.

Early life Bury was born in Worcestershire in 1616; he was baptised in Rock, Worcestershire on 8 December. According to Walker, he was originally a tailor, and was put into a home in Great Bolas, Shropshire, in place of a deprived rector. Calamy claims that Bury was a man of learning, educated at Coventry Grammar School and at Oxford, and that before obtaining the rectory of Great Bolas, he had been chaplain to a gentleman's family, as well as an assistant to an elderly minister. He received Presbyterian ordination. He began his ministry in Great Bolas sometime before 1654. Ministry In parish records he signs himself 'minister and register' until 1661, when, as a consequence of the act of confirming possession of benefices, he signs 'rector.' His entries suggest that he was interested in astrology. Ejected in 1662 after refusing to sign the Act of Uniformity, Bury, who remained at Great Bolas in a house he had built, lived under significant hardship. On 2 June 1680, Philip Henry gave him ¬£4, from a sum left at his disposal by William Probyn of Wem. Henry's 22 July 1681 diary entry has an account of the distraint of Bury's goods (he is here called Berry) for taking part in a private fast on 14 June. After this, he faced continued persecution and frequently moved location to avoid being caught by authorities. In later life, his circumstances were improved by bequests. Some years before he died, Bury became blind. He died on 5 May 1700, from gangrene in one leg. Family By his wife Mary, he had at least five children: *Edward, b. 1654; *Margarit (sic), b. 12 Feb. 1655; *John, b. 14 March 1657; *Mary, b. 13 Aug. 1660; *Samuel.
