Piracy was a phenomenon that was not limited to the Caribbean region. Golden Age pirates roamed off the coast of North America, Africa and the Caribbean.  Background  Map of The Atlantic Ocean, 1814 Pirates and sailors are important in understanding how the Atlantic world looked and worked. Defying traditional alliances, attacking and capturing merchant vessels of all nations, pirates wreaked havoc on an emerging economic system, disrupted trade routes and created a crisis within an increasingly important system of trade centered on the Atlantic world.Marcus Rediker, Villains of all nations : Atlantic pirates in the golden age (Boston: Beacon Press, 2004). They were ready and willing participants in the exchange of people, ideas, and commodities around the Atlantic basin affecting the creation and destruction of communities.J.H. Elliot, \\"Atlantic History: A Circumnavigation,\\" in The British Atlantic World, 1500‚Äì1800, eds. Armitage, David and Michael J. Braddick (New York: Palgrave, 2002). Trade routes along the Middle Passage were one of the main cogs in establishing what is known as capitalism today. For pirates in the Atlantic World, trade routes are fortuitous, because of the vast wealth they supply in the way of cargo that moved along the Middle Passage. From 1715 to 1728, pirate activity created problems for merchant ships along the trade routes, thus halting growth during that period. As piracy along the Middle Passage increased, so did the need for owners of the merchant vessels to insure the cargo on board their ships, because not only was there threat of loss from natural disaster, there was the chance the cargo could be lost to plundering pirates. \\"The genius of insurance,\\" in the way it contributes to finance capitalism, is the insistence that the real test of something's value comes not at the moment it is made or exchanged, but at the moment it is lost or destroyed.Ian Baucom, Specters of the Atlantic (Duke University Press, 2005). Pirates, buccaneers, and privateers Blackbeard Pirates are often equated in the modern mind with privateers and buccaneers, but neither label accurately describes piracy during the early eighteenth century. Each of these terms describes men who loot ships or settlements. The difference lies in the amount of societal acceptance that these men were afforded. Buccaneers were a cross between genuine privateers commissioned to defend a country‚Äôs colonies and trade, and outright pirates. The buccaneers were originally of French origin and usually pillaged the Caribbean islands and along the coasts of Central America, Venezuela, and Colombia from the 1630s to the 1690s. Alexander Exquemelin enlisted with the buccaneers and wrote about the bold feats of raids as they disrupted shipping on the high seas and terrorized Caribbean settlements. His book, De Americaensche Zee-Roovers (The Buccaneers of America) is one of the few first-hand accounts of the life and actions of the buccaneers. Many buccaneers raided trading routes across the Atlantic and within the Caribbean. The Buccaneers had many successful people but probably the most famous was Henry Morgan. Morgan was responsible for raids in Cuba, Panama, and Venezuela. Like many buccaneers, Morgan was based in Port Royal, Jamaica. In 1670 Morgan led a fleet of thirty-six ships and 1,846 men, the largest fleet of pirates or privateers ever assembled in Caribbean history.Hanselmann, Frederick H, Tomas Mendizabal, and Juan G Martin \\"Plundering the Spanish Main: Henry Morgan‚Äôs Raid on Panama\\". In Pieces of Eight: More Archaeology of Piracy, edited by Charles R. Ewen and Russell K. Skowronek. Gainesville, Florida: University Press of Florida, 2016. Privateers were sanctioned by their respective governments to raid enemy vessels. The colonization of the Atlantic saw many conflicts among the French, Spanish and English; raiding by privateers was one way to gain an advantage. The captains of these ships were given letters of marque by their governments, intended to validate all actions against the enemy.Polk, William R. The Birth of America: From Before Columbus to the Revolution. New York, NY: HarperCollins Publishers, 2006. The pirates of the early eighteenth century, however, were men who acted on their own apart from official political sanction. Pirates were very specific, unauthorized entities who worked outside the more socially accepted scenarios and did not discriminate when conducting their raids.Anderson, J. L. Piracy and World History: An Economic Perspective on Maritime Predation, Journal of World History, Vol. 6, No. 2 (Fall, 1995). The act of piracy was \\"massively\\"Rediker, Marcus. \\"Under the Banner of King Death\\": The Social World of Anglo-American Pirates, 1716 to 1726, The William and Mary Quarterly, Third Series, Vol. 38, No. 2 (Apr., 1981). criminal. Laws against piracy were often very strict, with charges and punishments escalating in attempts to curb piratical actions.Hughson, S. C. The Death-Struggles of Colonial Piracy. The Sewanee Review, Vol. 1, No. 2 (Feb., 1893). But many braved the consequences of being caught if it meant a life lived more freely. Geographic area Pirates, during what is called the \\"Golden Age of Piracy\\" of the late seventeenth century and early eighteenth century operated on a truly global scale. The Golden Age of Piracy \\"The Golden Age of Piracy\\" is a term used by historians to refer to the most widespread increase of \\"sea banditry\\"Frank Sherry, Raiders and Rebels: The Golden Age of Piracy (New York: Hearst Marine Books, 1986). on record. Although scholars agree that there was a boom in raiding and pillaging activities in the early eighteenth century, there are various schools of thought regarding the length of time that was the Golden Age. The shortest amount of time that is agreed upon is from around 1715 to 1725. The signing of the Treaty of Utrecht ended the War of Spanish Succession, ending the authorized privateering that was a part of the war and marking the beginning of the Golden Age of Piracy. Another group holds that the Golden Age was from around 1690 to about 1725. The longest definition of the Golden Age runs from 1650 to 1726, to include the buccaneers and other piracy endeavors. History leading up to Golden Age of Piracy European- based piracy of the modern era began in the \\"Atlantic Triangle\\". This common area of oceangoing commerce between Seville & Cadiz, the Azores Islands, and the northwest coast of Africa, encompassing Madeira and the Canary Islands was haunted by both European, as well as the Berber Coast pirates of North Africa throughout the sixteenth century. As consistent trade increased between Spain and Portugal and the East and West Indies, respectively, so did piracy. What Spain and Portugal would call piracy was often sponsored by, even if only at times marginally, monarchs such as Elizabeth I and Edward VI of England. Most popular in this era of privateers was Francis Drake. Drake raided Spanish settlements and shipping in the South Sea shores of present-day Peru, Chile, Brazil, and Venezuela, along the coasts of Central America. This era was notable for beginning somewhat regular long-term visits to the west Coast of the Americas and further to the East Indies, often after stopping in West Africa to loot slaving ships or towns. Dutch merchants were active in the Caribbean, mining salt and dyewoods on the coast of Brazil. This activity lead to dozens of raids along the West Coast of the Americas and to the formation of the West India Company which had semi-legal standing as privateers. This large continuous harassment incensed Spain and put their inhabitants in fear. By the turn of the seventeenth century this vast expansion of the Dutch had formed colonies in the East Indies and soon they started feeling as well the wrath of piracy. Shortly buccaneers followed in the seventeenth century. These bandits mostly raided land settlements. They were \\"embittered Dutch sailors\\", \\"abandoned French colonists\\", \\"abused English, Scots, and Irish indentures.\\" North Atlantic Most of the pirates known during this period originated from Europe. Much of the known pirate activity that took place in the Northern Atlantic was along the Eastern Seaboard of Canada and the US mainland, from Newfoundland to the Florida Keys. Newfoundland fisheries were known as recruiting areas for pirates in the early eighteenth century. Black Bart Roberts had a run-in off the coast of Newfoundland as well. There he captured Samuel Cary, who gave an in-depth account of the event to a Boston newspaper. New York was a popular place for pirates to unload their goods.Bradley Nutting, \\"The Madagascar Connection: Parliament and Piracy, 1690‚Äì1701\\". The American Journal of Legal History, Vol. 22, No. 3 (July 1978). One of the best known events is Blackbeard's blockade of Charleston's port. Africa Africa was intimately tied to the economy of the Caribbean. Responsible for fueling the sailors that pirates preyed on, the sugar plantations of the Caribbean, and the mainland colonies of Spain and Britain, traffic from Africa was routinely targeted by pirates. On numerous occasions, mutinous slave ship crews turned pirate. Bartholomew Roberts wreaked havoc for traders of all goods on the west coast of Africa. One of the earliest rumored places where pirates collected was on the island of Madagascar, off the East coast of Africa. This was their base of operations for their pecking of the Mogul Empire. Here they could prey on the successes of the East India Companies while being a world away from any authority. These are the same outlaws that were plundering the West Indies. The English pirate Avery, or Henry Every plundered a Mogul ship, gaining immense wealth. Avery was said to have settled on Madagascar and was never heard from again, though it was rumored he retired in Ireland. Some writers speculate that this event put in motion a series of events that would help lead to the multitude of laws passed for decades to come. As capitalism developed as an economic system in early modern Europe, overseas colonies became increasingly important in the Atlantic trade system.Joyce Appleby, The Relentless Revolution: A History of Capitalism, (New York: W.W. Norton & Company, 2010). Labor-intensive colonial plantations generated a need to find a stable, long-term labor force. Indentured servants posed a problem in that they had legal rights and could eventually become a competing force. The advantages of slave labor in comparison with the disadvantages of indentured servitude contributed to the growth of the European slave trade.John Thornton, Africa and Africans in the Making of the Atlantic World, 1400‚Äì1800, (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1998). Pirates were a bane to English attempts to gain supremacy on the African coast. They disrupted the flow of labor and capital by attacking, capturing and sometimes destroying slave vessels. Pirate captains often absorbed captured slaves into their crews, and blacks, both African and African American made up a substantial part of the pirate vanguard.Peter Linebaugh and Marcus Rediker, The Many-Headed Hydra: Sailors, Slaves, Commoners, and the Hidden History of the Revolutionary Atlantic (Boston: Beacon Press, 2000). As long as pirates were actively disrupting the slave trade, they posed a threat to England's dominance in the Atlantic system. The slave trade/Middle Passage was just as much a part of life in the Atlantic as was the merchant shipping of goods. Many European powers had ties to the slaving trade by at least the eighteenth century; countries like Portugal, Sweden, Netherlands, France, and England all had outposts on the African coast. Slavers would conduct their business with the larger African tribes who would buy weapons from the Europeans and in turn use them to collect members of other tribes to sell to slave captains.Marcus Rediker, The Slave Ship: A Human History (New York: Penguin Group, 2007). Once in the hands of a slaver, the slave represented a substantial investment as Ian Baucom suggests, by the insuring of slaves purchased. Some European cities such as Liverpool would become successful from operating in this trade system, and would drive the slave market to handle as much business as was possible. With slaving remaining an open and competitive business, there existed both what Rediker calls a \\"fort trade\\" and a \\"ship trade.\\" Slaves were kidnapped and brought to forts where they would be held by the local authorities until bought and shipped out. While the ship trade refers to captains making stops along the African coast at points where there was not a European presence to gather up the slaves themselves; they would also stock up on the necessary provisions for the Middle Passage at these stops. The captives were not the only ones who were mistreated on slave ships, as Rediker points out the lash \\"operated without regard to race, age, gender, law, or humanity. Many of the sailors were beaten mercilessly when they would refuse to beat the slaves as harshly as the captain wanted or at all. A sailor could make roughly one to one and a half thousand dollars in current pay, which back in the eighteenth century was a fairly large sum of money for a single trip.  Magadoxa  Magadoxa is a chapter in Daniel Defoe's General History of the Pyrates that is not specified as an identifiable location of a country or city. However, using the context of the Magadoxa chapter in Defoe's book as well as two maps from the Library of Congress, the chapter described is of present day Somalia, probably the capital Mogadishu. General History of the Piyrates described \\"Turkish and Arabic languages\\" spoken by the natives that Captain Beavis and his crew encountered with in the year 1700. However Madagascar: A Short History described the origin of the Malagasy language to be of Bantu, Austronesian, and even Java mix. Some influence of the Swahili language is also part of the roots of the modern Malagasy language.Idib., 505. Two maps provided by the Library of Congress illustrated the Red Sea, Gulf of Aden, Aden Yemen, north coast of Somalia, and a coastal outline with Magadoxa listed. However, both separate maps had the same town on them called P. Dell Gada. Magadoxa is on the second map south past P Dell Gada while the first one shows P Dell Gada on the modern Northeast coast of Somalia. Magadoxa would then have to be off of the east coast of Somalia around the center considering the far distance illustrated by the scale of leagues. Captain Beavis was trying to go to Surat, which is in west India and practically a straight path from Somalia. Also, Somalia's language does have Arabic influence to correlate with the description given by Defoe of a mulatto who spoke to them in the Arabian tongue.Defoe, _General History of the Pirates_ , 1972, p.543 A \\"great mosque\\" was also mentioned by Defoe as well as an illustration of the City of Magadoxa rather than Magadoxa being described as a country or an island like Madagascar.Idib., 544-545. A mosque would be practically expected in a region with Islamic influence and proximity to the Red and Arabian Sea. Captain Beavis was also said to have gotten lost in the higher Ethiopia, which borders present-day Somalia . The correlations of the descriptions given make a better case of Magadoxa being Somalia rather than Madagascar, and illustrate pirate influence in a region of Africa in close to connection to the Mughal Empire. center center Pirate havens Marcus Rediker argues pirates followed a lucrative trade and sought bases for their depredations in areas that were \\"distant from the seats of imperial power\\". Pirate havens such as the Bahamian Islands began to attract pirates by the hundreds because no government existed. Matthew Frick also argues \\"near-autonomous nature of a feral city\\" along with \\"geographic position accessible to the world's oceans\\" creates a perfect place from which to conduct acts of piracy. Frick also states that pirates are not likely to rule over much land the farther one moves away from the beach and even the smallest portion of a coastal city that tolerates the existence of pirates enables pirates to establish a \\"toe-hold on land that will spread cancer-like\\" to the water surrounding it.\\" Once on land and established, pirate havens become a scene of fear and lawlessness controlled by the pirates who inhabit it and \\"governments are perpetually at odds\\" on how to rid the pirates from their land bases without the risk of \\"excessive collateral damage\\" and loss of innocent lives.Matthew Frick, \\"Feral Cities Pirate Havens\\" Proceedings of the United States Naval Institute 134 (2008). Pirate demographics Origins Geographically, they \\"left behind little or no property and few documents by their own hands.\\" Most of the pirates were from England, Scotland, Ireland, and Wales. Of that population approximately one-quarter were linked to British port cities like Bristol, Liverpool, and Plymouth. Approximately one-quarter of the populations were associated with men of the West Indies and North America. The others \\"came from other parts of the world such as Holland, France, Portugal, Denmark, Belgium, Sweden, and several parts of Africa.\\" Howard Pyle's doodle of the carriage of a treasure chest by two pirates, a caucasian and a black man, as they are led by pirate captain William Kidd Seafaring \\"became one of the most common male occupations\\" for Africans and African-Americans in the early 19th century. Black sailors filled about one-fifth of the population at various sea havens. Becoming a pirate offered a choice of other occupations for African-Americans that could improve their conditions.W. Jeffrey Bolster, Black Jacks: African American Seamen in the Age of Sail (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1997). \\"Africans and African Americans both free and enslaved were numerous and active on board pirate vessels.\\" Some chose piracy because the only other option was slavery. Some black pirates were escaped slaves. Boarding a pirate vessel became a way to escape to the Atlantic North undetected. Escaped slave Frederick Douglass disguised himself in \\"sailor's garb,\\" and \\"was able to travel undetected to the North and his freedom.\\" As crewmen, blacks made up part of the \\"pirate vanguard.\\" They also worked the seafaring trades of \\"ship building, caulking, and sail making.\\" Class An important factor of turning to piracy is one's social class. Pirates typically composed themselves from amongst the lowest social classes. They were just men that saw piracy as a lucrative opportunity in which they had little to lose. A simple attraction for the lower social class was money. These \\"dispossessed proletarians\\" sought the wealth they needed to live and an escape from the dreadful working conditions they had to endure. Piracy also represented a counterculture that attracted the working class. Living outside the society that oppressed them, presented an ability to attain liberty at sea. As pirates, men could organize a social world apart from the authoritarian environment that composed of mercantilism and imperial order, and use it to attack that authority's property. Life at sea made available a singular opportunity of freedom that the lower social classes could acquire. Piracy meant to forsake \\"fundamental social rules, escape conventional authority, manufacture their own power,\\" and accumulate a considerable amount of wealth. Occupation The occupational background of the people that turned to piracy \\"came overwhelmingly from seafaring employments.\\" Pirates customarily had experience in labor as merchant seamen, sailors of the royal navy, privateers, and sometimes as fishermen. It was beneficial to have experience within these occupations because life at sea was hard and dangerous. Seafaring skills would ease the difficulty of pirate life and provided occupational advancement whilst on board. A vast majority of pirates also came from the crews of captured merchant vessels. Frequently, captured merchantmen would volunteer to join the pirate crew. The captors were already \\"familiar with the single-sex community of work and the rigors of life-and death-at sea.\\" They saw little difference between merchant and pirate life; understanding that their other option was death, the men usually volunteered to join ranks. This favored the pirates because they preferred volunteers. This preference was reasoned by the fact that they were more likely to create social cohesion amongst the crew. \\"Other pirates had been indentured servants, especially the fourteen-year variety.\\" A fourteen-year indenture \\"meant that they had been transported to the colonies in punishment for crimes committed in England.\\" Transferring from one life of crime for another was painless. Age According to Gilje and data collected at the time of the American Revolution, the ages of pirates ranged from fourteen to fifty years old. More than half of the population were in their twenties. The average age was 25, with less than 20 percent of seamen under twenty years old. Most of the men within that percentage were eighteen or nineteen. At the time, a ship may contain a boy of ten or twelve, but it was very uncommon. On these occasions, it was the parent or guardian that made the arrangements and would sign the boy away to a ship. Approximately 20 percent of the populations were men in their thirties, forties, and fifties. This small percentage was a commonality because by the time a man reached his thirties, he likely moved on to a \\"new occupation ashore, turned to fishing, labored on the docks, or had been lost at sea.\\" Aside from the criminal world of piracy, there was also the emerging colonies in North America. While nearly as dangerous and deadly as becoming a pirate, colonialism in the Americas offered those who dared, a chance at changing their socioeconomic place. In many ways, the freedom of colonialism and piracy are very parallel. Both are risky and dangerous, and gave an individual the chance to make many decisions of their own accord..\\"  Becoming a pirate  Mutiny Hans Turley argues mutiny was common on long voyages and often discipline was brutal if captains heard discussions of revolt even though these actions were a serious offense due to the \\"direct assault on the order - thus the status quo - on a seagoing vessel.\\" Turley also argues that the \\"temptations to turn pirate\\" centered on the opportunities for employment and profit; and therefore was a result of when the \\"wars ceased, sailors faced either remaining idle or making smaller wages\\" or ultimately turn pirate. Other mutineers were \\"privateer crews\\" who became \\"frustrated by the lack of booty\\" or even became greedy or were unhappy with their terms.Hans Turley, Rum, sodomy, and the lash : piracy, sexuality, and masculine identity (New York: New York University Press, 1999). These temptations for mutiny, according to Rediker, grew from an \\"array of resistances against such concentrated authority\\" and the sailors developed an understanding of the importance of equality. However, also according to Marcus Rediker, only one third of all mutinies at sea led to piracy. \\"Collectivism\\" and \\"anti-authoritarianism\\" was cemented into the mutineers core values and all of these beliefs would influence the decision to turn pirate and how they would conduct themselves thereafter. In contrast to the egalitarian belief towards mutiny, Peter Leeson argues, the \\"prospect of sufficient gain\\" may influence a sailor; piracy could pay extremely well sometimes better than privateering. A pirate could enjoy every penny of the ship's \\"ill-gotten booty.\\" Another argument against the egalitarian idea of mutiny that Leeson suggests is that the pirate was as \\"self-interested as anyone else\\" and \\"given the opportunity\\" would ultimately \\"take ten times as many shares\\" as his fellow pirates if in fact they could get away with it. Impressment Impressment refers to the coercion of a sailor into joining a crew, either by a navy or by a rogue crew of pirates. Though prevalent throughout the Royal Navy, was also implemented by Atlantic pirates to maintain a healthy number of crew members. In both instances, the practice brought with it rampant desertion and lowered morale, which was especially true in the case of the British Royal Navy, some of whom even went on to join pirate crews. Pirates, however, were no exception when it came to turnover. According to Denver Brunsman, \\"the vast majority of impressments in colonial regions involved small numbers of seamen, mostly to replace the diseased, deserted, or deceased.\\" Because of the naturally dangerous life of a pirate (or a common seaman for that matter) impressment was an \\"evil necessity\\" of 18th century maritime life, and one that remained a blight on the English Royal Navy until the conclusion of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815. State sponsored, or military impressment was entirely different in the Atlantic World when compared to impressment in the world of piracy. According to Paul Gilje, impressment was used by England as a way to deny liberty to those who called the colonies home. While the manpower would be welcome on the ship, the more important goal of England exerting its power over people it once had rule over was purely for political reasons. Pirate ships would often impress those who had skills that were deemed to be beneficial for the running of a successful ship. Although this was not standard policy early on in the Golden Age of Piracy, by the early 1720s pirate ships began to take on more impressed hands because of lack of seamen willing to join of their own volition. When Blackbeard captured the French frigate La Concorde and renamed her the Queen Anne's Revenge he forced the three surgeons on board, carpenters and a cook to remain with his pirate crew. The rewards of piracy Pirates fight over treasure - Howard Pyle The obvious answer as to why a sailor would become a pirate is for the potentially enormous monetary gain. These gains were impossible to achieve in the navy or working on merchant ships. While many pirates were caught and punished by the state, untold numbers disappeared, presumably with their newly acquired riches.Daniel Defoe, A general history of the pyrates (Mineola N.Y.: Dover Publications, 1999). Another reason that piracy may have appealed to some is that the pirate ship freed them from the hierarchical command structure, often enforced with violence, found in the navy and on merchant vessels. Still others may have become pirates to continue living in a homosocial world wherein they could practice their preferred sexuality.B Burg, Sodomy and the pirate tradition : English sea rovers in the seventeenth century Caribbean (New York: New York University Press, 1995). Possibly a sailor weighed all of these issues when deciding whether to become a pirate. Pirate ships Queen Anne's Revenge Pirates did not have the luxury of building their ships; they were \\"acquired\\". As a result, a pirate captain had to be on the lookout for a vessel that would serve his purpose and procure the ship without harming it in such a way as to make it unfit for service. There is consensus among scholars that pirates would use both small vessels like a sloop or a full-rigged pinnace, as well as the larger slave ships (but not as often), and on rare occasions the warship.Angus Konstam, The Pirate Ship: 1660-1730 (Oxford: Osprey Publishing Ltd.). Along these lines, the naval historian David Cordingly categorized pirate attacks that had been reported along the North American seabord between 1710-1730 by the numbers of recorded attacks, with an overwhelming 55% involving sloops, 25% in the larger ships, 10% in brigs and brigantines, 5% in schooners, 3% in open sail-less boats, and 2% in snows. Smaller ships certainly had advantages in the Caribbean and along coastal waterways. They could be careened much easier and faster than the larger vessels, which is a great advantage when a pirate ship could not pull into a dry dock or take long stretches of time to perform maintenance. Small vessels also had shallow drafts and could hide \\"among sandbanks, creeks, and estuaries\\" where larger ships could not. The smaller vessels also had a speed advantage over shorter distances than the larger ships of the age. The ratio of displacement to sail capacity was high on small ships, meaning it was easier to bring the boat up to speed fast and produce more speed with less sail. Small vessels made up the bulk of the pirate fleet in the West Indies and the Atlantic for these reasons; among the favored were the single mast sloops and schooners. For all of the advantages of a small ship, there were drawbacks that could sway captains to look to larger vessels. A sloop or a ship of similar size could not carry a large enough crew to take on bigger prizes by boarding and couldn't carry enough firepower to force submission or fight it out with larger foes; it was also limited in the amount of cargo it could carry. In terms of firepower, anything the size of a sloop would not carry more than fourteen guns, with the French sloop's carrying six guns or less.Benerson Little, The Sea Rover's Practice: Pirate Tactics and Techniques, 1630‚Äì1730 (Washington D.C.: Potomac Books Inc., 2005). Conversely some of the largest pirate ships like Bartholomew Roberts flagship the Royal Fortune sported forty-two guns. Successful pirate crews would capture or buy a small ship to begin with and then \\"trade up\\" to larger ones. However changing ships many times was not the norm and most crews would stick with one or two ships. A pirate would make the switch from a small to large vessel for the advantages a small ship could not provide or to replace a ship that was damaged or needed such extensive repairs that could not be done by the crew. When a ship was captured, it had to be converted into a vessel suitable for the pirates needs. This meant knocking down cabin walls and lowering the forecastle to create a flush deck, allowing greater utilization of deck space in engagements and storage of armaments. Any unnecessary decorations or structures would be stripped off and as many guns as possible were fit. What was left when they were finished was a sleek, armed to the teeth ship with as much thought to speed and efficiency as possible. It was not easy to capture an English or French \\"Man-of-War\\" (see \\"ship of the line\\"), but pirates would sometimes come across large ships that could be easily converted for use, slave ships; these were full rigged, three mast giants; a slave ship loaded down with human cargo and a small crew was easy prey for pirates who wanted to take her or strip everything of value. An example of this is the pirate capture of the Princes Galley, a slaver heading to the Caribbean. The pirates pursued and caught the galley, firing their guns to slow and stop the slave ship; eventually they pulled up alongside and took the gold, gunpowder, weapons, and slaves and sailed off. Weaponry Archaeologists Lawrence E. Babits, Joshua B. Howard and Matthew Brenckle propose that Pirate weaponry might include weapons of several nationalities and sizes and pirates might be presumed to have a variety of weapons, which could have been captured as they upgraded their vessel and personal weapons; pirates also may have \\"shifted weaponry from one vessel to another\\" to create a \\"more powerful armament.\\"Lawrence E. Babits, Joshua B. Howard, Matthew Brenckle, \\"Pirate Imagery,\\" in X Marks the Spot, edited by Russell K. Skowronek and Charles R. Ewen. (University Press of Florida, 2006). For example, Blackbeard's flagship, the Queen Anne's Revenge, was discovered in late 1996. This vessel was originally mastered by Henry Bostock (1717) and captured by Blackbeard on December 5, 1717Wayne R. Lusardi, \\"The Beaufort Inlet Shipwreck Artifact Assemblage, \\" in X Marks the Spot, edited by Russell K. Skowronek and Charles R. Ewen. (University Press of Florida, 2006) and what was found on it was a \\"smaller two cannon exhibited inscriptions\\", which revealed that one was manufactured in England\\" and the other in Sweden.Mark U. Wilde-Ramsing, \\"The Pirate Ship Queen Anne's Revenge,\\" in X Marks the Spot, edited by Russell K. Skowronek and Charles R. Ewen. (University Press of Florida, 2006). Wayne R. Lusardi argues there is \\"considerable reasonable doubt\\" for the ships identification and Blackbeard's flagship, and if it is Queen Anne's Revenge, the \\"artifact assemblage does not reflect\\" in any way a \\"distinctly piratical material culture.\\" Lusardi also states the idea of a pirate leaving small arms and ammunition on a grounded vessel is perplexing, yet \\"many abandoned items occur in the archaeological record.\\" Since then thirty one cannon have been identified and more than 250,000 artifacts have been recovered. The cannon are of different origins such as; Swedish, English and possibly French, and of different sizes as would be expected with a colonial pirate crew.D. Moore.

Skowronek and Charles R. Ewen. (University Press of Florida, 2006). Grenades were also explained by Defoe as \\"case bottles fill'd with powder\\" with \\"shot, slugs, and pieces of lead or iron\\" with a quick \\"match at the end of it\\" presently ran into the \\"bottle to the powder.\\" Others argue that any suggested pirate ship or pirate artifact models includes precisely those items that an armed merchantman would have, including a \\"mix of cannon of different sizes\\", often from different nations, loaded with \\"shot designed to damage a vessel's rigging and personnel.\\" Also, personal weaponry such as pistols, cutlasses, and knives would be found on any vessel, which Rediker argues was used to \\"slit the noses of captives, cut off ears\\" and used the \\"knife and gun against their victims.\\" Terrorism as tactics The Early Modern World was replete with various methods of coercion and violence that the state would utilize to impose its will on the lower rungs of society. Not only did they lose the control over their lives, but many were subjected to various methods of torture and capital punishment. The institutionalization of these devices cultivated the notion of terror from above. According to Marcus Rediker \\"Pirates consciously used terror to accomplish their aims\\" which varied from physical violence and intimidation to acquiring remunerations. Pirates primarily sought easy gains that would allow them to acquire booty while avoiding actual conflict. The most pronounced tool pirates had at their disposal when confronting a potential prize was to employ the Jolly Roger. This symbol was easily identified and the consequences of resistance were equally as well known. Sailors knew that, if in their attempt to defend their ship they failed, there was a great possibility that they could be tortured. The renown of pirates was not solely based on or confined to the co-opting of disciplinary tactics commonly used by the men sailing with official commission, but also due to their habit of \\"destroying massive amounts of property\\" with impunity. The desecration of cargo and impairing of ships were standard occurrences in run-ins with pirates. This is believed to be an \\"indirect terror\\" against those the pirates saw as their enemies. Theft The pirate's characteristic loot included various ships' cargo like slaves or tobacco. There were also very unconventional trophies, such as the wig of a captured captain that the famed pirate Walter Kennedy once took as booty. The most sought after prize that pirates wanted to capture was, unquestionably, a ship, an ocean vessel that pirates could convert to suit their own needs. Pirates would scrape a captured ship for guns, masts, rope, and other supplies that could repair or improve their current vessel. Whereas capturing a ship that was more equipped and more powerful than their current craft was the ultimate prize, the issue was that \\"the pirate could only capture a prize which his vessel could catch.\\" A faster, larger ship with quality weaponry indicated that the pirate could capture other treasures more easily. It was not tricky for pirates to steal \\"deep-sea sailing ship, especially small, fast, and well-armed craft such as sloops.\\" The most common method of acquiring prizes was capture. Capturing was a way in which a pirate could overcome a ship by boarding, gunnery, and possibly intimidation. Another method within piracy was the \\"crime of opportunity.\\" Pirates would take their time identifying a target which was easy to capture. The \\"easy\\" targets were rare whilst on the high seas. This meant that pirates usually had to lie in wait for the opportunity to capture anything. Due to their opportunistic and sometimes patient methodologies, pirates for the most part were able to \\"capture their prizes without fighting.\\" Threatening violence was an effective way that pirates were able to plunder ships, and \\"force disclosure of information about where booty was hidden.\\" Those in the Atlantic were affected greatly as pirates captured, plundered, and burned \\"hundreds of merchant ships\\" with valuable cargo. However, the goal of the pirate was to rob the ship without fighting or blood loss. Pirates faced losses from \\"resistant victims who hid or destroyed\\" loot. Because of this, pirates made an effort to \\"maximize profit\\" and minimize conflict, which could be detrimental to the pirates, the profits, and the ship. Though pirates wanted to avoid fighting, they still had to overcome the lost potential of hidden loot. Two examples of loss could come when a captured ship's crew \\"destroyed booty to prevent pirates from taking it\\" or when a crew would hide \\"valuables to keep them out pirate hands.\\" Pirate theft was not only to gain money; papers with information like the route of government authorities or the location of another vessel with a larger booty were also important. Once an item was found, a question of its worth and how to distribute it came next. If an object was \\"indivisible,\\" then the pirates would sell the object or auction it off, and the profits would then be divided. Like most people, pirates \\"were creatures of incentives.\\" Piracy allowed a crew to benefit from \\"every penny of its ship's ill-gotten booty.\\" One's share of the plunder was directly proportionate to a crewman's job aboard the ship, and was outlined in the ship's articles. If a pirate were to take more than his share, hide in times of war, or was dishonest with the crew, he \\"risked being deposited\\" somewhere unpleasant and full of hardships. Also, ships were not the only things that were able to be plundered. A select group of pirates also attacked a Sierra Leone fort and several fortresses used for the slave trade.  The life of a pirate  Governance and shipboard relations Pirates were outlaw sailors, but that doesn't mean they didn't have their own form of government aboard their ships. The wooden world of piracy was very much structured when it came to shipboard relations. Suffice to say, this structure did not mimic the oppression of a naval ship sailing under the king's crown, \\"They wanted leadership by example, not leadership by ascribed status and hierarchy.\\" Before each voyage, or upon the election of a new captain, compacts were drawn up to which guidelines the ship would function. Under these agreements were allocations of authority, distribution of plunder and rations, as well as discipline enforcement. =Rank= Ranks that were found on ordinary vessels of the seventeenth, and eighteenth century were found on pirate ships. They were a necessary part of working together efficiently to survive the perils of the seas. Failure of captains and other officers to condescend to seamen could result in the desire for the crew to mutiny, thus challenging the officers' right to deference. The late 18th century's challenges to monarchical and aristocratic power structures bled over into shipboard life. Pirates were mostly former merchant seamen, or at least men who had sailed on vessels legitimately before turning to piracy. As a result, a pirate ship still had the usual terminology found on merchant ships, but the role each ranking sailor would play on the pirate ship was not the norm.David Cordingly, Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life among the Pirates (New York: Random House, 1995). A pirate ship still had a Captain of the vessel. As the economist Peter Leeson argues, pirate captains were democratically elected by the entire crew. This was not a lifelong title and had less power than the merchant captain, as Leeson provides evidence of pirate captains being removed from the position, in one case thirteen captains were removed during one voyage, for not performing at the level that was expected of them or for overstepping their bounds of authority. The Pirate captain had absolute command when pursuing a vessel or in military engagements, otherwise he was another member of the crew. To check the power of the captain even further, the crew would elect a quartermaster to make sure the men received the necessary rations and equal distribution of the booty. He would also \\"adjudicate crew member conflicts,\\" and \\"administer punishment.\\" This was usually an experienced seaman who the crew trusted and knew well. Leeson further states that a pirate captain could not take any action without the support of the quartermaster. One such was Hendrick van der Heul who sailed with William Kidd. He had the fortune to have never been convicted of Piracy and lived a full life beyond his days on the Adventure Prize. Other ranks include the boatswain, master, gunner, doctor, and carpenter. The regular crewmen held the most power on the pirate ship in the council, from which all important decisions were made, and every pirate was given a vote. Surgeons on some pirate vessels, because of their higher status in regular society and special training, were not allowed to vote when the council took to the ballot box. =Discipline= Shipboard discipline aboard merchant and naval vessels was notoriously harsh, and, more often than not, violent. Pirates, having suffered under these measures, used a more democratic process when determining how aberrant sailors would be punished, and there were fewer transgressions that were considered punishable. These punishments were still often violent, which was the norm in the early 18th century. Community A part of becoming a pirate was to meet the expectation of uprooting their living environment and spending most of their time out at sea. The men were required to live in cramped, claustrophobic quarters within close proximity of others. The discomfort could have created a more hostile environment, but it did not. While on the ship the pirates \\"maintained a multicultural, multiracial, and multinational social order.\\" This new social order established a profound sense of community amongst the men. They consistently showed solidarity for each other and developed strong feelings of group loyalty. The communities of pirates were willing to join forces \\"at sea and in port, even when the various crews were strangers to each other.\\" The positive communal atmosphere aboard ship created a home-like situation where there were limited social and physical boundaries within the group. Clothing Howard Pyle's 20th century depiction of a pirate captain No standard issue uniforms for anyone on board a vessel were issued prior to 1748 in the British royal Navy. Clothing was somewhat standardized by 1623 when it was made possible for sailors to purchase clothing at fixed prices from the Navy Commissioners. The selection was not extensive; items included: Monmouth capps, Red Caps, Yarne Stockings, Irish Stockings, Blew Shirts, White Shirts, Cotton Waistcoats, Cotton Drawers, Neats Leather Shoes, Blew Neck Clothes, Canvas Suites, Ruggs of one breadth, and Blew Suites. Until 1664, sailors that were pressed into the Navy were not given any clothing, forced to use what clothes they had on their backs until accumulating several months of pay when they could then buy clothing. Pirates of the early eighteenth century and prior wore much the same clothing as any sailors. Clothing, like any useful tangible good, when captured as booty, would be distributed out. Calico Jack Rackham was known for his \\"flamboyant dress.\\"Kris Lane, Pillaging the Empire: Piracy in the Americas, 1500‚Äì1750, (Armonk: M. E. Sharpe, Inc., 1998). Sir Richard Hawkins, the famous Elizabethan privateer advocated wearing armor in battle while at sea. Records indicate that there were not nearly enough pieces of armor for all to wear, so it likely was for his officers and himself.Dudley Jarret, British Naval Dress (London: J. M. Dent and Sons Ltd, 1960). Woolen clothing was worn in more extreme latitudes. Like in the stories of Anne Bonny and Mary Read, women, often when on a vessel would don men's clothing. This was immortalized in an English folk song, \\"My yellow locks I will cut off, men's clothing will put on, And I will go along with you and be your waiting-man.\\"H.E.D. Hammond, Lucy E. Broadwood, Frank Kidson, A.G. Gilchrist, \\"Songs of Soldier and Sailor Life: William and Nancy; or, Lisbon,\\" Journal of the Folk-Song Society, Vol 7. No. 27. (Dec, 1923). Pirate speech As academics like Peter Leeson and Marcus Rediker argue, a pirate was more often than not someone from a previous seagoing occupation. They were merchant seamen, sailors in the royal navy, and privateers, all of whom would form into a pirate crew. They were not upper class, but the \\"dregs of society.\\" George Choundas argues in his book Pirate Primer that there was in fact a pirate language, but it was simply accents and the way of speech to which men of the seas were accustomed. They came from different ethnic backgrounds or political units, so pirate speech was simply the way these men could communicate; and what they all knew was the language of the seas.George Choundas, Pirate Primer: Mastering the language of Swashbucklers and Rouges (Georgetown: Writers Digest Books, 2007). It was the nautical speech of the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries. Food and alcohol Pirate Captain John Phillips forcing a prisoner at gunpoint to drink alcohol. Pirates of the Atlantic ate much of the same foods as their mainstream mariner cohorts. Often they would get more of it, but ideally, they would get far greater quality food. Mariners in the merchant and naval service were often given meager amounts of low quality sustenance. During a typical week five non-pirate sailors might share four or five pounds (pre-salted weight) of beef, and five pounds of bread. Scarcity of food might be the main reason some sailors turned to pirating, like pirate John Phillips who \\"ranted and raved\\" about the merchant John Wingfield, claiming that he starved his men. The primary difference between legal mariners and their unlawful counterparts is that they hoped to find an abundant supply of food with the capturing of vessels. A defining difference in the food system on a pirate vessel is that they did not have to compete with officers like sailors in the navy or merchant services. Food and alcohol were treated similarly to each other, split equally. The necessaries of life were distributed equally, unlike booty, which was usually given in higher proportions to officers, as directed in their articles. Bread, butter, cheese, and meat were items that were considered luxuries by many low level mariners, but items that a pirate would look forward to as often as possible. There is evidence pirates specifically hoped to find edibles in their loot over specie. One pirate, Joseph Mansfield, claimed that the \\"love of drink\\" were greater motives than gold. This policy of strict equality does not seem to be applicable to earlier privateers, as Kris Lane points out in Pillaging The Empire: Piracy in the Americas, 1500-1750. Dutch Sea Rover of the seventeenth century, Joris Van Speilbergen and the expeditions leaders dined on \\"Beef, pork, fowl, citrus, fruits, preserves, olives, capers, wines, and beer,\\" while the common crew of that voyage \\"scrounged herbs\\" with mussels and berries.\\" Captain George Lowthar used deception, pretending to be a friendly merchantman, came aboard a fellow merchant ship to extend customary greetings. There, Lowthar's crew secretly inspected the cargo and found items of interest. Once making their intentions known to the boarded crew, they ended up taking thirty casks of brandy and five hogshead of wine, among other goods. Lowthar's crew had only decided to seize the ship once they decided it was worth taking. Sailors might hope to supplement their meager diets with fish if they were lucky enough to catch them. The islands frequented were plentiful with potential foods, such as turtle, seafowl, shellfish, and fish. Sea turtle was considered some of the best meat possible. While at sea, when supplies were low, fresh fish such like snapper, shark, catfish, grouper, albacore were caught and often barbecued, though one would have to be certain not to let the deck on fire. When food was scarce, a rationing system may be put in place similar to legal sailors. In some cases, the only items there were requested of the looted victim from pirates was food and drink. When gold or silver was found, food was a popular item to barter for when bartering was easier than fighting. Water was essential, but difficult to keep usable for very long. Alcohol, like beer and especially wines would keep much longer. Like food, pirate crews were given equal title to captured strong liquors. Alcohol, notoriously, was spent quicker than on other, more traditional marine vessels. Ironically, slaver turned pirate Bartholomew Roberts was a \\"sober man\\" and would not allow his own crew to drink on board the ship. Woodes Rogers, privateer turned pirate hunter noted a drink called \\"flip\\". Flip consisted of rum, beer, and sugar, served warm, often in a tin can. Another popular drink was punch. Different versions were made depending on what ingredients were available. One rum version was called \\"bumboe.\\" Captain George Shelvocke enjoyed \\"hipsey,\\" a concoction of brandy, wine, and water. Andrew Brown's sermon during the late 18th century focused on the perils of \\"the seafaring life.\\" Focusing on the overindulgence of alcohol, he preached that drinking had become habit for pirates. He continued that overindulgence had \\"long been regarded as one of the distinguishing characteristics of seafaring life.\\"Andrew Brown, A sermon on the Dangers of the Seafaring Life; Preached Before the Protestant Dissenting Congregation at Halifax and Published at the Desire of the Maritime Society in that Place, (Boston, MA, 1793).B. R. Burg writes extensively about the debauchery and riotous behavior of pirates when they got a hold of quantities of alcohol. There are numerous cases where pirates were too drunk to capture ships, defend their own ships, negotiate for prisoner exchanges, control crews & preventing mutinies and sometimes even to just navigate, in one case ending up with 118 men of a 200-person crew perishing because of a shipwreck. Blackbeard, after a \\"prolonged drinking bout\\" and while \\"uproariously laughing\\" shot his mate, Israel Hand's knee, \\"laming him for life.\\" Illness, disease, and health Sickness and diseases such as, dysentery, malaria, smallpox, and yellow fevercreated problems among ships and \\"could be fatal.\\" Pirates, like privateers, were a little better off than those who worked on merchant or naval ships as \\"food was superior,\\" \\"pay was higher,\\" \\"shifts were shorter,\\" and the crew's powers of \\"decision making was greater.\\" Epidemics and scurvy led some to desert \\"naval vessels for pirates.\\" In the event of disabilities occurring while in service to the ship, some pirates set up a \\"common wealth\\" plan to be paid to any man in the event of injury. Medical artifacts recovered from the wreck site of Blackbeard's Queen Anne Revenge include; a urethral syringe used to treat syphilis, pump clysters to pump fluid into the rectum, a porringer which may have been used in bloodletting treatments, and a cast brass mortar and pestle used in preparing medicine. =Doctors and surgeons= There were doctors and surgeons present on some pirate vessels. Any surgeon or doctor who sailed with pirates, according to Rediker, was considered by their peers \\"to be insane.\\" Surgeons/doctors were paid more shares, between \\"one and a quarter\\" and \\"one and a half,\\" than other men on pirate ships. However, doctors and surgeons weren't always trusted as they were not allowed to vote with the crew \\"because their class background (or forced status).\\" Women on ships Superstitions surrounding women on ships were rampant. Being on board a pirate ship demanded \\"physical strength and stamina\\". Few women were seen as able to do the work to the standard. It was widely believed aboard ships that women were detrimental to both work and social order. Women were \\"objects of fantasy\\", yet they were also seen as cause of poor circumstances, disagreement, and \\"potential breaches in the male order of seagoing solidarity\\". A rare occurrence in which a woman was persuaded to board a pirate ship comes from the story of Captain Eric Cobham and a prostitute named Maria. Even though the ship's articles stated boys and women were not permitted on the ship, Cobham faced no repercussions from the crew when he brought her aboard. While on the ship, Maria proved that she was \\"as callous as the worst of them\\". Maria's actions made Cobham \\"more nervous than ever,\\" so much so that she effectively scared him from pirating.Druett, Joan. She Captains: Heroines and Hellions of the Sea. (New York, NY: Simon and Schuster, 2000) Anne Bonny, after meeting \\"Calico Jack\\" Rackham, came aboard his ship and gave him the necessary votes he needed to be elected captain. Anne was then elected \\"second-in-command\\", but she became the true leader of the ship and even took the captain's residence away from Calico. As a leader, Anne designed her attacks with \\"cunning and fantasy\\" which allowed her to escape unharmed from possible battles through duplicity and \\"a good measure of theater.\\"Ulrike Klausmann, Marion Meinzerin and Gabriel Kuhn [eds.], Women Pirates And the Politics of the Jolly Roger (Canada: Black Rose Books, 1997). Mary Read was less rash and spontaneous than her counterpart, Bonny. Read was also admired for \\"her virtue and sense of justice\\". Both Read and Bonny dressed as women aboard the ship but would change into trousers for battle. These women were accepted by the crew due to their management ability, navigational skills, and by their continued perseverance to outperform the rest of the crew. Bonny and Read were independently established as fierce, swashbuckling women, and were defined as genuine pirates in every sense. Pirates and sex Carolyn Eastman finds that pirates were represented as hypermasculine characters from the 18th century forward, and she notes that they were depicted as sexual transgressors. She argues that this imagery of piracy appealed to elite men, who enjoyed the thought of an alternate masculinity without the restraint required of men in the upper classes.Carolyn Eastman, \\"Shivering Timbers,\\" Common-Place 10, no. 1 (October 2009): 1, http://www.common- place.org/vol-10/no-01/eastman/ . \\"Enemies of all mankind\\" Hosti Humani Generis The scourge of the high seas pirates were cast as \\"hostis humani generis\\", a term which was derived from Roman law. This title was rendered onto them in part by Sir Edward Coke in his effort to renovate existing legislation which dealt with piracy. As a consequence of this label, an Admiralty Judge by the name of Sir Charles Hedges would issue a sweeping proclamation which would grant the power of \\"jurisdiction over all people ‚Äì anywhere on earth ‚Äì who interfered with English commerce.\\" The last great epoch of piracy gave rise to individuals who as a cohort were defined by, \\"their almost universal rejection of national and religious authorities.\\" In the book Rum, Sodomy, and the Lash, Hans Turley delves into the implications of the multidimensional threat pirates posed to the social and economic establishment within British realm. Turley states that there was an argument to be made in which pirates were perceived to \\"belong to no class at all\\" and that they had \\"turned their backs to normative society.\\" Furthermore, to solidify the rendering of the term hostis humani generis to pirates, Turley connects the economic and legal implications stating that pirates were \\"criminal merchants\\" who were \\"opposed to law-abiding seafaring merchants.\\" Cotton Mather Cotton Mather, a Puritan minister wrote that the coast had been plagued by pirates and his congregation wished they could be rid of this nuisance. Mather believed that his prayers were answered when six pirates were captured and taken prisoner. Before their execution took place, he both \\"bestowed the best instructions\\" he could and prayed with them.Cotton Mather, The diary of Cotton Mather, D.D., F.R.S. for the year 1712 (Charlottesville: University Press of Virginia, 1964). After preaching to the pirates Mather, wanted them to \\"provide examples and warnings\\" to the crowd awaiting the executions to \\"affirm the values of Christianity.\\" Ministers advocated that children should be \\"protected\\" from this rebellious lifestyle and should be \\"kept from going to sea.\\" Many ministers felt that pursuing religion while at sea would be \\"impossible to sustain as long as sailors took the name of the Lord in vain.\\" Minister John Flavel also made the point that the sea was a place \\"with strange creatures\\" where sins proliferated and \\"death was omnipresent.\\" Flavel continued that seamen were \\"to be numbered neither with the living nor the dead, their lives hanging continually in suspense before them.\\" Life at sea was tough, which could cause men to feel their \\"own insignificance and dependence upon the almighty God.\\"Paul A. Gilje, Liberty on the Waterfront, (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2004). There were even societies and organizations that promoted religion to sailors along the waterfronts, such as \\"The Marine Bible Society of New York, the Seamen in the Port of New York (SPGAS), and the American Seamen's Friend Society (ASFS). Pirates were viewed as godless individuals, and yet \\"the closest thing to\\" a \\"pirate constitution\\" was New England \\"puritan church ‚Äòcovenants,'\\" just without the acceptance of the divine.Peter Leeson, Invisible hook : the hidden economics of pirates. (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2011). \\"God- fearing people\\" claimed that pirates were \\"devils\\" \\"bound for hell.\\" Some pirates, such as Blackbeard, embraced this belief by inverting \\"the values of Christianity,\\" casting themselves in a way that \\"society understood to be evil,\\" and even to the embrace of Lucifer. Legal system Prior to the mid-17th century, how Atlantic pirates were treated under the law broadly adhered to a 1559 treaty between France and Spain which laid out the ‚Äúno peace beyond the line‚Äù rule, meaning that hostilities in New World waters (anything west of the Azores) was not governed by European norms. As Spain gradually lost hegemony in the Atlantic, however, this policy fell out of use, and British laws became increasingly important in the legal world of piracy. The early 17th century saw a more coherent legal view of piracy begin to take shape, with the work Mare Liberum (Free Sea) by Dutch jurist and polymath Hugo Grotius attempting to draw a legal distinction between ‚Äúprivateers‚Äù with letters of marque from ‚Äúpirates.‚Äù Grotius also attempted to brand Spain and Portugal‚Äôs dominance of the sea as a form of piracy in itself, as it attempted to ‚Äúblockade the seas.‚Äù The late 17th century, when the ‚ÄúGolden Age of Piracy‚Äù was getting underway, saw a major shift in British policy, accompanying their rise as a maritime power. However, Britain itself had multiple competing legal systems which could claim jurisdiction over piracy. The legal system of the English during the late seventeenth century was built upon common law (28 Henry VIII, c. 15). This allowed circumstantial evidence to be admissible, but also forced the captured to be transferred to England where the law was enforceable. This made it burdensome for the colonial governments to enforce extradition. Additionally, Common law‚Äôs emphasis on local courts, the right to a jury of peers, and different treatment of Englishmen and foreigners clashed with the international nature of piracy; foreign pirates preyed on British ships and vice versa, and piracy often took place in waters outside British dominion, although the nationality of those involved might be British. Complicating matters was the British crown‚Äôs insistence on judging any piracy case which involved a British subject in any way. The inadequacies of common law led to the adoption of the Admiralty Law system, a system originating in the Middle Ages, to govern cases of piracy. During the seventeenth century, after Jamaica had become a haven for pirates. Henry Morgan was selected as deputy governor. During this period, there was debate among English scholars about the extent of jurisdiction of the 1536 acts. Jamaica had one of the first laws to deliver justice with royal legitimacy. It became known as \\"The Jamaica Act.\\" 1683 would mark the beginning of aggressive anti-piracy laws. The increasingly anti-piratical policy by the Jamaican government started an exodus from Jamaica. This law was the only one of its kind in the Caribbean or North American colonies and it simply forced the buccaneers and pirates out, into the Carolinas, New York, and the Bahamas. Bradley Nutting makes the argument that it was the early Golden Age pirates raping and pillaging of several Muslim pilgrims in 1695 that was initially responsible for the flood of legislation in the early eighteenth century. Following Henry Avery's capture of the mogul ship quote, the East India Company petitioned the Privy Council in 1696 to issue a proclamation of arrest. A reward of fifty pounds was offered for Avery's crew, while five-hundred pounds was offered for Avery himself. Those incidences lead to two major acts of Parliament which reshaped British policy towards piracy both in Britain itself and in the colonies. The 1696 Act for Preventing Frauds moved responsibility for prosecuting piracy from central British authorities to colonial governments, establishing colonial vice-admiralty courts to create uniformity. Prior to this act, there was considerable variance in the existence and enforcement of anti-piracy laws between Britain and her colonies, and between the colonies themselves. The 1698 Act for the More Effectual Suppression of Piracy made all acts of piracy \\"triable\\" either at sea or in the newly created colonial admiralty courts, suspended the right to a jury trial for those accused of piracy, and encouraged British colonies to double down against piracy. The Piracy Act of 1700. The legislation took two years to pass after repeated pressures from the East India Company and the Board of Trade. There was now authorization to set up vice-admiralty courts throughout the colonies with legal authority to carry out sentencing. The first notable pirate to be brought to trial with this new set of laws was Captain Kidd. Kidd was denied an adequate defense, as well as the ability to review documents he claimed would exonerate him. Ironically, he was acquitted of piracy, but convicted of murder. Regardless, he was executed and his body was hung in chains over the River Thames for years. After the end of the War of Spanish Succession (1702‚Äì1713) and the Peace of Ultrecht legal privateers working for a legitimately recognized government simple turned to piracy. As many politicians feared, the privateering strategy of war backfired. Corruption of local officials was also a problem for authorities. Edward Teach (Blackbeard) bribed the colonial governor of North Carolina to avoid prosecution. An increased effort to combat piracy with naval forces, effectively stamped out piracy. This combination of laws and naval efforts was responsible for thousands of deaths of pirates and alleged pirates. In a time when royal mercy and pardons in England routinely commuted death penalties to lesser sentences, especially one or another form of bound labor (after the Transportation Act of 1718), pirates rarely had their sentences lessened and instead were hanged in huge numbers and high percentages.  Pirates on trial  Pirates themselves often considered the court trial which awaited many of them to be little more than shams. On at least one occasion, the pirates of Antis' crew staged a comedic mock trial which satirized the legal system as unjust and bloodthirsty, stacked against them. However, in many cases suspects accused of piracy could call favorable witnesses, challenge jury selection and produce documents in their favor. In some cases, notably the trial of Capt. William Kidd, the suspect was even granted professional legal counsel. Even after the Act for the More Effectual Suppression of Piracy abolished the necessity of a jury in piracy trials, trials often were decided by juries rather than judges. At the same time, judges in piracy trials interfered to tip the scales against a suspected pirate, helping ensure their execution by hanging. Despite this, however, pirate trials were not entirely one-sided, and pirates on multiple occasions secured non-guilty verdicts in courts. = List of pirate trials = Four examples of Pirate Trials range from 1676 to 1861. * Trial of George Cusack and Crew (1676) * Trial of Crompton Guyther and Crew (1680) * Trial of Capt. William Kidd (1701) * Trial of the Privateer Savannah on Charge of Piracy (1861) Naval enforcement It was not until the signing of the Treaty of Utrecht was signed in 1713 settling the war with France that Britain could make a serious attempt to deploy its navy against piracy. By 1718 the royal naval was refit for action against the pirates and with third, fourth, and fifth-rate warships armed with some seventy plus guns, it was more firepower than any pirate ship of the time could have withstood. As David Cordingly argues, the pirates were \\"no match for naval squadrons of this strength,\\" and that the only reason piracy had been so successful was because the British government had not put this level of effort into hunting pirates before. Two well known naval actions against pirates are the successful destructions of Edward Teach, or Blackbeard, and Bartholomew Roberts. In 1718, off the coast of North Carolina at the Ocracoke Inlet, Teach's ship was at anchor and surprised by Lieutenant Maynard of the Royal Navy. Maynard and Teach engaged each other with small arms and cannon until the ships were close enough to board; Maynard boarded the pirate ship to fight Teach, and the notorious pirate eventually fell. Blackbeard's death became the stuff of legend and was used by the Royal Navy in its propaganda campaign in eliminating piracy. In 1721 the infamous pirate Captain Roberts was cornered off the coast of Africa by a Captain Ogle in HMS Swallow, a powerful fifty-gun warship. Roberts was converting a group of French ships that he had captured for his own use when Swallow sailed up to engage. Roberts would fight Ogle despite being outmanned and outgunned; he fell during the battle. With arguably the most famous pirates of the time gone, and the American coast and Caribbean swarming with the Royal Navy and privateers hired by governors of the American colonies, piracy was systematically hunted to near extinction. The punishment for piracy Captain Kidd's corpse displayed after his execution In the Atlantic world of the 17th and 18th centuries piracy was defined as any criminal act committed on the high seas. This means that many of those accused of piracy were criminals but not necessarily a crew of sailors capturing ships. William Wood who was convicted and hanged for taking his captains money after he and another sailor got in an argument with him and threw him overboard. Defoe/Johnson published the statute relating to piracy in the early 18th century in A General History of the Pyrates. The crime was differentiated from wartime privateering in the statute, and defined who was punishable in very specific terms. The prescribed punishment, if convicted, was \\"Death without Benefit of Clergy, and forfeit Land and Goods.\\" The statute was applicable to the American colonies, but Scotland was excluded. A death sentence could be carried out on captured pirates at sea without benefit of trial, according to the statute. Often clergy were called in to advise the prisoner in the time before his death, or someone else fulfilled this role. Throughout his text, Defoe/Johnson describes the punishments meted out on captured pirates. Public execution by hanging was typical, although some were given lesser sentences such as indentures if the court was unconvinced of their complicity with the pirate mission, or if there were other extenuating circumstances. Bodies were also sometimes displayed after the execution. Executions in the early 18th century were somewhat common throughout the Atlantic world, and there were hundreds of crimes that could lead to execution.Philippe Rosenberg, \\"Sanctifying the Robe,\\" in Penal practice and culture, 1500‚Äì1900, ed. Simon Devereaux and Paul Griffiths (Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, 2003). The Admiralty Courts and men like Cotton Mather would eventually wrest power from the rogue elements. With gruesome public acts taking place for all to see, pirates would be killed and displayed en masse at many of the ports they once looted or called home in the New World. Ghost ships The Amazon in 1861, later the Mary Celeste The term \\"ghost ship\\" is a long-standing seafaring term for \\"any vessel found sailing without her crew.\\" Supernatural powers are bound to surface in any discussion of ghost ships. One well-known ghost ship is the Flying Dutchman that is said to be continuously exploring for \\"safe harbor\\" and is condemned to eternally \\"haunt the cape.\\"Brian Hicks, Ghost Ship: The Mysterious True Story of the Mary Celeste and her Missing Crew, (New York, NY: The Random House Publishing Group, 2004). It was not unusual for a crew to abandon their ship in times of \\"sinking,\\" by use of lifeboats or acquiring another vessel. Occasionally whole crews might have been \\"swept overboard\\" in rough weather, but the vessel would be destroyed enough to explain the crew's fate. Even less frequently, ships could be overtaken by pirates or from a mutiny within the crew. During this time, the crew would be \\"abducted and forced\\" to man other vessels. In 1735, the ship Baltimore was found anchored in Chebogue, Nova Scotia. The people of the town speculated about the \\"supernatural powers\\" that guided the vacant ship. After an investigation aboard the ship occurred, the men noticed the deck \\"was awash with blood.\\" Once inside, the men found a woman who described how \\"local Indians\\" murdered the crew. After this, the ship was abandoned as not a single person \\"wanted to buy it, sail it, or even go aboard.\\" Some time passed before the locals learned the crew was actually murdered by the prisoners being carried in the vessel, and the woman was one of ten inmates who had survived. An unknown ghost ship was seen in 1785; the vessel had \\"no sails\\" and \\"no crew\\" with \\"fifteen Africans on board.\\" Based upon their desolate condition, it was deemed their time on board the ship had been lengthy. A \\"shipboard rebellion\\" might have occurred in which the crew had perished along with some Africans. In this scenario, it is possible that none of the survivors understood \\"how to sail the vessel and they slowly starved to death\\". In the twentieth century, the ship Carroll A. Deering was found in the Atlantic with no crew aboard. The lifeboats were missing and the theories surrounding the ship included \\"piracy, mutiny, and insurance fraud.\\" The most notorious of all ghost ships is the Mary Celeste - it has been called \\"the greatest maritime mystery of all time.\\" The ship was found wet after a storm by the crew of Dei Gratia, because the ship was opened to air out. One theory surrounding the vessel is that the crew needed to air out the ship from chemical fumes from the alcohol. The crew had left everything because they \\"expected to come back\\" to the vessel after the fumes had cleared. They got off the ship temporally and waited for the ship to air out in their \\"small yawl,\\" but the weather changed before they were able to get back to the vessel. The crew of eight men, a mother and child \\"watched, helplessly\\" as the ghost ship sailed away without her crew. Attitude toward death On every voyage a sailor would face the risk of falling overboard and drowning, starvation, disease, abuse, accidents in the rigging, and attack. Once a sailor abandoned his law-abiding career to become a pirate he knowingly increased his chance of expediting his own death exponentially. Once convicted as a pirate, a sailor faced an almost certain demise of being hanged at the execution docks. When on trial in Charleston, the pirate Job Bayley was asked why he had attacked several warships that were sent to capture him, he answered that \\"We thought it had been a pirate.\\" At yet another trial in London the pirate John Bayley comically played dumb when the Judge asked what he would have done if the warship that apprehended him was nothing more than a merchant ship answering, \\"I don't know what I would have done.\\" Both men knew that their fate was sealed the moment they were apprehended and both in turn hanged at the gallows. The story of pirate William Fly, who was executed on July 12, 1726 in Boston, illustrates how arrogantly many pirates viewed death. He showed no anxiety over his imminent demise, but rather tied his own noose and lectured the hangman about the proper way to tie the knot. Right before he swung off to his death he delivered a warning to all ships captains and owners that in order to prevent their crews from mutinying and resorting to piracy, they would be wise to pay their crews on time and treat them humanly. Some pirates preferred to control their own fate. Pairs of pirates would at times make oaths to one another that in order to insure that neither were captured they would shoot each other. The crew of Bartholomew Roberts preferred not to be taken alive and swore to blow themselves up rather than give the authorities the satisfaction of seeing them hanged. When Roberts and his men were finally found an attempt was made to blow the ship up rather than face capture, however it proved in vain due to an insufficient gunpowder. Edward Teach's (Blackbeard's) crew also failed to detonate their sloop when facing capture however, the pirate Joseph Cooper and his crew successfully blew themselves up and evaded capture by the authorities. During the 17th and 18th centuries execution in the British realm was commonplace and a part of life. During the 17th century alone around 800 people were hanged each year in the British Empire. For a pirate however the odds of finding yourself on the gallows were much higher. In just the ten-year span between 1716 and 1726 at least 418 pirates, and possibly as much as half again more, were hanged. In this world a pirate could be nearly certain that if caught he would end up with a short drop and sudden stop with a noose cinched around his neck. The gallows were an icon of the 17th and 18th century and could be readily found throughout the Atlantic world. The gallows were particular visible in port cities that routinely featured an execution dock such as \\"Hope Point\\" the famous execution dock on the river Thames in Wapping, England. For many pirates this would be the place that their career was put to an end. For some, however, their body would serve one more function, as a reminder. Hundreds of pirates were hanged and their bodies left to dangle in port cities around the world as a reminder that the maritime state would not tolerate a challenge from below. Examples of this barbarous practice can be seen throughout pirate history, including those of William Fly, whose body was hung in chains at the entrance of Boston Harbor to rot, and Calico Jack, whose body was hung at the mouth of the harbor of Port Royal, Jamaica.  Implications  Trials Rather than civil courts, pirate trials were overseen by the Court of Admiralty. The Court of Admiralty \\"held mass trials\\" with \\"large numbers of pirates at one time\\" as demonstrations to those interested in taking on a pirate's life. The trial transcripts were frequently published and confessions by those who were to be executed were \\"very popular.\\" The publication of the trials was intended \\"to inform, enlighten, and entertain the reading public\\" as well as \\"make a profit for the book sellers.\\" Reprints of trials were a common occurrence in order to gain political strength. Though the trials took place in English, they were transcribed in Latin as a way to further remove the public from the transcription's truth and to use it as propaganda. Much of these pamphlets felt repetitive in nature as many of the statements and arguments were the same, just with different names. Trials were also a place of humor, as Job Bayley, who was facing execution for being a pirate, stated that he had not stopped for the government vessels because he had feared the ships were pirates. Usually, the trials took place in England, due to the fact that the \\"Admiralty feared that officials in the far-flung outposts of the empire could be bribed.\\" However, an issue with holding trials in England was that the pirates would have to be transported \\"across vast distances.\\" The law regarding piracy trials was changed at the beginning of the eighteenth century, granting more relaxed rules and allowing for trials to take place in English colonies, so long as a Court of Admiralty was available. Pirates faced greater danger of being executed when the law changed, as it stated if a pirate was taken at sea, an official trial was not necessary, but the end result of execution was to be the same. An act in 1700 allowed for the expansion of the definition of piracy to include not just those \\"who committed robbery by sea,\\" but also the \\"mutineer who ran away with the ship\\" as well as the \\"sailor who interfered with the defense of his vessel\\" under a pirate siege. In both 1717 and 1718, pardons were granted in order to \\"rid the sea of robbers.\\" For example, Israel Hands, Blackbeard's henchman, was taken with fifteen other pirates to Williamsburg, Virginia to stand trial. In exchange for a pardon, Hands testified against corrupt North Carolina officials with whom Teach had consorted. The minutes of the North Carolina Governor‚Äôs Council for May 27, 1719 state; Hesikia Hands[,] master of Capt Thaches Sloop Adventure[,] seems to sweare possitively in his Depossition that the sd [said] Thache went from Ocacoch Inlet at his returne into this Country from his last voyage with a present to the sd Tobias Knights house [,] when by the same deposition [Hands] acknowledgth that to be out of the reach of his knoledge[,] he being all the time at the sd Inlet which lyes at above thirty leagues distance from [Knight‚Äôs] house and further the [said] Tobias Knight doth pray your Honours to observe that the aforsd Hesikias Hands was . . . for some time before the giving of the [said] Evidence kept in prison under the Terrors of Death a most severe prosecution . . . . Many stipulations came with these pardons, as they were only granted in certain instances and few surrendered. The few who \\"accepted the amnesty\\" would eventually return to their pirate ways. Death was also promised to those found helping pirates, as well as \\"loss of wages\\" and \\"six months' imprisonment to those who refused to defend their ship.\\" Instead of having black pirates stand trial, colonial officials would profit \\"by selling them into slavery rather than hanging them.\\" Trials for women pirates were not uniform in sentencing and punishment. Mary Harvey, whose alias was Martha Farlee, was sentenced in North Carolina in the year 1726. Both Mary and her husband Thomas had joined a pirate gang, and shortly thereafter Mary was captured. Since North Carolina lacked the infrastructure to try pirates, Mary and three others were sent to Williamsburg. Mary \\"was acquitted and given money to return home\\" as the court deemed she had been coerced into joining the pirate gang. Two of the other captives were not as lucky, and were \\"condemned to die.\\" The third captive was pardoned. Three years later, another female pirate, Mary Crickett, along with five others, was ordered to be executed. When Mary Read and Anne Bonny were captured, they faced execution. However, once their pregnancies were known, they were pardoned from the gallows. Both women were sentenced to prison, where Mary Read eventually perished and Anne Bonny later escaped.  Pirates in memory  Daniel Defoe 1706 A General History of the Pyrates In 1724, the first edition of A General History of Robberies and Murders of the Most Notorious Pirates was published. The author was listed as a Captain Charles Johnson, whose real name is unknown. However, what is most important about this work is not who penned it, but that it represents what people thought about pirates in the early eighteenth century. A General History of the Pyrates set the tone for every work on pirates that has been written since. Pirates as the anti- Hero Pirates were not members of society; they were outside the social norms that would allow Buccaneers and Privateers to remain within the infrastructure of a society. The key reason they cannot be grouped with any social order is because they embraced terror, and particularly as Marcus Rediker phrased it, \\"a terror of the strong against the weak.\\" The historian Hans Turley used the phrase \\"Hostis Humani Generis,\\" translated as the enemy of all mankind, to provide an image of pirates. Pirates have thus become the \\"antiheroes\\" of history, and this they did so consciously. Eventually the governments of the known world would make villains of these sea raiders calling them \\"blood lusting monsters,\\" whose sole purpose was \\"destroying the social order.\\" The pirate would attack every element of the modern society to form his own identity. They would attack merchant shipping from any nation, plundering the wealth of the ship, and most of the time sinking or burning a great number who fell into their hands. Revenge was sought against merchant captains and officers who were known to have been cruel or unreasonable in the treatment of their crew, often through torture and slow death. Not to limit themselves on the amount of wealth available to them, a few pirates would even attack slave ships and slave fortresses on the African coast to take slaves (though generally speaking, pirates would free slaves they encountered), for whom they knew some governments would pay for in gold coin; most notably the Portuguese. Hans Turley looks to the literary evidence of Pirates, and in particular Captain Avery, when drawing the conclusion of the pirate as the \\"antihero.\\" Avery's story became the stuff of legend to the masses, and the \\"fictional exaggeration\\" of Avery cemented in the minds of the readers the image of a brute bent on theft, ransom, and power. Turley assures us that the stories were lifted beyond the realm of reality but it is impossible to know for sure who the real Captain Avery was, and it was legitimate to believe the stories due to the lack of any evidence to the contrary. An attack on commerce and shipping meant an attack on the governments to who these ships belonged. Governments would stop turning a blind eye to these bandits when the costs of ignoring them outweighed attacking the pirate, and so a \\"campaign to cleanse the seas,\\" was put into effect by governments, lawyers, businessmen, writers, and other members of legitimate society. Marcus Rediker argues that religion was another point of contention for the pirate, who saw the church as a piece of the system he wanted to escape. The Pirate was seen as existing in sin by those who lived in normal social constructs, and he relished the separation, likening himself to hellish images and Satan. As an example Blackbeard and his use of smoke, fire, and ash bellowing from his large bead to give the impression of a demon from hell itself, as Johnson/Defoe describes him. Pirates would mock and ridicule men of the cloth who they came in contact with, and did not observe Christian holidays. With their attacks on private property, belief systems, and governments pirates became outcasts to the realm of the unknown and dangerous. This realm, the sea as Rediker suggests, aided in the view of the pirate as a danger, a threat of invasion, and uncontrollable entity; just as the sea was to those who both knew the sea and had only heard tales. It was the sea that was separated from authority, and thus was the pirate who could attack those who entered the oceans. Sources of information about Pirates Scholars consider many sources of information during their research. Primary sources are documents and records that are original to the time that is being studied. Secondary sources are written later, and can include commentary on and interpretation of primary sources. Firsthand information about piracy is relatively rare, and scholars often pull from the same texts when compiling their data. During the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, narratives of sea captains and pirate adventures took many forms. * Books: Piracy inspired many books during the Golden Age. Books like The Buccaneers of America by Alexandre Exquemelin, first published in 1678, and A General History of the Pyrates by a Captain Charles Johnson, published in 1724, were extremely popular, often earning many editions and reprints. These stories provided insight into a mysterious subculture in the Atlantic World while shedding light on how the public often viewed piracy. * Trial Records: When pirates were put on trial in Admiralty or Vice Admiralty courts, unofficial records of the proceedings were frequently published in pamphlet form. Official records were also kept and can be accessed by scholars today, but the pamphlets were created to be sold and the accounts were easily sensationalized to attract buyers. These records of the trials showed the public examples of the law and its triumphs over the crimes of piracy. The pirates themselves were often secondary characters in these narratives. * Religious Sermons: Messages by ministers like Cotton Mather warning against piracy were intended to scare the public into social submission. These sermons would emphasize the crimes of accused men and show piracy to be the \\"antithesis\\" of the desired Christian way of life. Ministers detailed the sins of piracy and called for repentance in their execution sermons, using fear of damnation to further chastise onlookers and exhort clean living. * Newspapers and Periodicals: Newspapers also published information regarding pirates, their captures, and their trials, as they did other news of the day. * Archaeology is increasingly providing another perspective on piracy. Pirate shipwrecks such as Queen Anne's Revenge (used by Blackbeard), Whydah Gally (used by Sam Bellamy), and Quedagh Merchant (used by William Kidd) have been excavated.

Pirates in dime novels The dime novel is sensationalist fiction originating in the 1860s. Irwin P. Beadle & Company standardized the books into a format that contemporary readers could easily identify at newsstands and in book catalogs. They had a yellowish orange cover that often feature a woodcut illustration. Dime novels were very popular with a wide readership. During the Civil War Beadle & Company shipped the books by the crate to the army and by mid-1965 they had published between 35,000‚Äì80,000 copies.John Tebble, Between Covers: The Rise and Transformation of Book Publishing in America, (New York: Oxford University Press, 1987). There are several comprehensive indices of published titles, but the most prominent is the work of Albert Johannsen.Albert Johannsen, The House of Beadle and Adams and Its Nickel and Dime Books: The Story of a Vanished Literature, vol. 1& 2, (Norman: University of Oklahoma, 1950). This is a two volume work with detailed information and the publishers Beadle and Adams, lists of titles and authorial biographies.

Red X marks the spot. Built in London in 1715, the Whydah Gally was a 300-ton galley originally commissioned for use in the slave trade. The Whydah left on her maiden voyage to the coast of Africa in 1716.Barry Clifford and Kenneth J. Kinkor. Real Pirates: The Untold Story of the Whydah from Slave Ship to Pirate Ship (Washington D.C.: National Geographic Society, 2008) After selling a cargo of slaves to in Jamaica, the Whydah was heading home to London with a new cargo of gold and silver when she was captured by Black Sam Bellamy in 1717. In the spring of 1717, Sam Bellamy and his crew sailed North with the intent to clean the ship, divide the spoils and determine the future of the crew. The Whydah was caught in a storm and capsized off the coast of Cape Cod. The Whydah was rediscovered in 1984 by Barry Clifford, a salvage diver and Cape Cod native.P.J. Capelotti, \\"The Treasures of the Pirate Ship Whydah\\" The Public Historian 15, no. 3 (Summer, 1993). =Controversy= Controversy surrounded the Whydah long before Clifford brought up the first artifacts. In 1982 the state of Massachusetts filed a claim of ownership on the Whydah treasure. After a long battle through a succession of courts, sole ownership of the Whydah was granted to Clifford in 1988.Ricardo Elia, \\"The Ethics of Collaboration: Archaeologists and the Whydah Project\\" Historical Archaeology 26, no. 4 (Advances in Underwater Archaeology, 1992) This was only the beginning of the troubles for the Whydah artifacts. New troubles arose when Silver Screen Entertainment directors, Tom Bernstein and Roland Betts proposed the concept for developing a large-scale museum complex devoted to the Whydah. The museum was offered to the city of Boston, where controversy surrounding the Whydah's history as a slave ship had already made waves with local government officials. The proposal for the museum included plans for a full-scale replica of the ship, a holographic image of Sam Bellamy, a conservation viewing area, interpretation of artifacts, a play acting out pirate hangings, and an exploration of the Whydah's history as a slave ship. Concern was raised that a \\"theme park\\" was being built around the concept of a slave ship. State representative Byron Rushing compared this concept to building a \\"theme park based on a concentration camp.\\" Ultimately developers Bernstein and Betts decided that the political atmosphere of Boston was to unsteady on the issue. Having ended negotiations with Boston, Bernstein and Betts looked to Tampa as a possible location for the complex. The Tampa debate unwound in a similar manner to the one in Boston. Opposition to the Whydah complex was spearheaded by Tampa Lawyer Warren Dawson, who voiced concerns that slavery was trivialized through an association with piracy.Kevin Shinkle, \\"Black Historians Begin Talks on Proposed Pirate Museum,\\" The Tampa Tribune, January 5, 1993, Business and Finance. A panel of historians was convened to discuss the issue of interpreting the Whydah's slave history. After careful review of the project the panel decided that the Whydah complex could effectively interpret slavery, but the decision created more controversy from the public. After months of negotiations and compromises the Tampa community was still divided over the potential implications of a Whydah museum. In mid-July 1993, the developers officially announced that they were pulling the project from Tampa.Kim Norris and Denise Smith Amos, \\"Tampa's Whydah Project is Dead,\\" The St Petersburg Times, July 20, 1993, National 1A. The Tampa community's feelings about the Whydah have mellowed little. In 2006 the controversy flared again when the Museum of Science and Industry (MOSI) attempted to host the traveling exhibit of the Whydah artifacts sponsored by National Geographic. After several conferences with area leaders, MOSI decided not to host the exhibit.Mike Salinero, \\"MOSI Shelves Exhibit Plans for Whydah Pirate Ship ‚Äì Foes Say It Slights Role in Slave Trade,\\" The Tampa Tribune, December 5, 2006, Nation/World 1. Philip Levy argues that the Whydah exhibit would have provided opportunity to explore connections between Atlantic pirates and slavery. The actions of Atlantic pirates, who often attacked slave ships and forts, created a crisis in the European slave trade. These actions were so detrimental that Britain viewed pirates as a \\"fearsome enemy\\" and a \\"great threat.\\"Philip Levy, \\"Tampa Again Refuses ‚Äì To Harbor Whydah,\\" The Tampa Tribune, December 6, 2006, Nation/World 15. Pirates as historical subject On the subject of piracy, writings in the nineteenth century mostly consisted of the reprinting of source materials with little, if any commentary or interpretation. Reprinting ensured that historians remained objective, and that the grand pirate narratives remained intact. The big names of buccaneers and pirates like Captain Morgan and Blackbeard were major players in those stories. In the first part of the twentieth century, scholars who did not present faithful reprints published books on piracy that were little more than rewriting the same well-known stories. The evolution of the history of piracy mirrors that of many other subjects. As historians began to stray from the strict retelling of these stories, piracy became more significant. In the latter part of the twentieth century, historians began to see the Atlantic World in early modern times as an important frame in telling stories of colonialism, capitalism, slavery, and modernity. In recent historiographical works, pirates have been viewed through various lenses. Modern scholars have posited many reasons for the rise in piracy in the early eighteenth century, from a growing social emphasis on economics and capitalism to rebellion against an oppressive upper class. Recent academic books on piracy in the Atlantic World focus on the pirates and their relationships with the wider world.

The species is known from the latest early to middle Miocene sediments exposed in the states of Oregon and Washington, USA. It is one of several extinct species placed in the living section Macrantha. Acer rufinerve leaf History and classification Acer latahense is represented by a group of fossil specimens from three different geologic formations. Three of the leaves were recovered from the early Miocene to late Miocene aged outcrops of the Latah Formation near Spokane in Washington state. Another leaf is from the similarly aged Mascall formation near Tipton, Oregon, while the last fossil is from the middle Miocene age Succor Creek Formation near Nyssa, Oregon. Both the Latah and Mascall Formations are composed of temporary lake beds which are interbedded with lava flows belonging to the Columbia River Basalt Group. While the very similar floral composition of the two formations has resulted in both occasionally being termed the Latah Flora, currently the Mascall and Latah are considered separate though coeval formations. The type specimens for Acer latahense are located in three different repositories. The holotype leaf type specimen, a part and counterpart numbered USNM 396136A, B, and two paratype leaves are currently preserved in the paleobotanical collections housed in the National Museum of Natural History, part of the Smithsonian. One other paratype leaf is housed at the University of California Museum of Paleontology in Berkeley, California, while the last paratype leaf is part of the University of Michigan Museum of Paleontology collections in Ann Arbor, Michigan. The specimens were studied by paleobotanists Jack A. Wolfe of the United States Geological Survey, Denver office and Toshimasa Tanai of Hokkaido University. Wolfe and Tanai published their 1987 type description for A. latahense in the Journal of the Faculty of Science, Hokkaido University. The etymology of the chosen specific name latahense is in recognition of the type location for the species at the \\"Brickyard site\\" outcrop, part of the Latah Formation in Washington State. Description Leaves of Acer latahense are simple in structure with a perfectly actinodromous vein structure in which the primary veins originate at the base of the lamina and run out towards the margin. The leaves are three- lobed with the lateral lobes being about one-third the length of the median lobe. The leaves have three or five primary veins and an estimated size range of long by wide in overall dimensions. The morphology of A. latahense suggests placement into the Acer section Macrantha. This is based on the overall vein structure and small uniformly sized teeth and the structuring of the veins. The combination of leaf morphology characters is most similar to the living maple species Acer rufinerve, commonly called the redvein or Honsh≈´ maple. A. latahense is distinguishable by the lower number of teeth, which tend to be blunter, and by the structuring of the tertiary veins structure. The extinct species Acer palaeorufinerve is also notably similar to A. latahense but has a broader medial lobe. Wolfe and Tanai suggest A latahense may be a descendant species of A. palaeorufinerve.

Early life Born in Copenhagen, Browne grew up in San Francisco and developed a vaudeville act. At one point he was performing as a duo with male impersonator Kathleen Clifford.Vaudeville old & new: an encyclopedia of variety performances in ..., Volume 1 By Frank Cullen, Florence Hackman, Donald McNeilly, page 150 He was in New York by 1908, when The New York Times reports him as suing Texas Guinan over the rights to a Gibson Girl stage act. Career Deliberately or not, Browne competed with the better-known female impersonator Julian Eltinge. Some audiences and theater managers found his act more seductive and therefore more unsettling than Eltinge. Browne's Broadway production Miss Jack opened in September 1911 at the Herald Square Theater, exactly one week before Eltinge's more successful The Fascinating Widow. Browne's only film appearance is the 1919 Mack Sennett production Yankee Doodle in Berlin, Sennett's highest-budget film up to that point, and a bit of World War I propaganda. This release was parallel to Eltinge's anti-German film Over the Rhine (re-cut into The Isle of Love three years later). The same year, Browne appeared as the headliner at the Palace Theater in New York, the single most sought-after booking in American vaudeville, in December 1919,Encyclopedia of Vaudeville, Anthony Slide, page 69 supported on stage by the Sennett Bathing Beauties. This appears to be the pinnacle of his career. He thereafter retired to teach dancing classes in San Francisco, and died in Los Angeles at age 79-80.

Life He was the eldest son of Walter Chambr√©, of Halhead Hall, Kendal, in Westmorland, a barrister, by his wife, Mary, daughter of Jacob Morland, of Capplethwaite Hall, in the same county. He was born at Kendal on 4 October 1739. After receiving an early education at Kendal Grammar School, he was sent to Sedbergh School, then under the care of Wynne Bateman. From Sedbergh he went to London, where first of all he entered the office of Forth Wintour, solicitor, in Pall Mall. He also became a member of the Society of Staple Inn; he moved to the Middle Temple in February 1758, and in November 1764 from the Middle Temple to Gray's Inn. In May 1767 he was called to the bar, and went the northern circuit, of which he soon became one of the leaders. He was elected to the bench of Gray's Inn June 1781, and in 1783 filled the annual office of treasurer. In 1796, he was appointed recorder of Lancaster. On the retirement of Richard Perryn from the judicial bench he was chosen as his successor. In order to qualify for the bench, it was necessary that Chambr√© should be made a serjeant-at-law. As Perryn had retired in the vacation just before the summer circuit, and serjeants could only be called in term, a special act of parliament (39 Geo. III, c. 67) was passed authorising for the first time the appointment of a serjeant in the vacation. Under the provisions of this act Chambr√© received the degree of serjeant on 2 July 1799, and on the same day was appointed a baron of the exchequer. Lord Chief Justice James Eyre dying five days after the special act had received the royal assent, the same difficulty again occurred, and a general act (39 Geo. III, c. 113) was then passed in the same session authorising the appointment of any barrister to the degree of serjeant during the vacation if done for the purpose of filling up a vacancy on the bench. Lord Eldon was the first judge appointed under the provisions of this act. On 13 June 1800, Chambr√© was transferred to the court of common pleas, as successor to Sir Francis Buller. In this court he remained until December 1815, when he resigned his seat, and having sat on the bench more than fifteen years became entitled to a pension of ¬£2,000 a year by virtue of an act passed in the same year in which he had been appointed a judge (39 Geo. III, c. 110). Chambr√© died at the Crown Inn, Harrogate, on 20 September 1823, in his 84th year and was buried in the family vault in Kendal parish church, where a monument was erected to his memory. He was never married, and was succeeded in his estates by his nephew, Thomas Chambr√©.

Miller also found himself convicted and later acquitted of the murder of a government official in a high-profile case during his time in Somalia.Miller, Gerald L. with Shari Miller Wagner. A Hundred Camels: A Mission Doctor's Sojourn and Murder Trial in Somalia. Telford, Pennsylvania: Cascadia Publishing, 2009. Print. Background Miller's background in the Mennonite church influenced his service and played a major role in the murder trial. Miller grew up in Shipshewana, Indiana, United States. There, he learned about his Mennonite faith at his church where they shared some of his relatives' missionary experiences. Miller continued his schooling at Goshen College and later received his doctorate from Indiana School of Medicine. Miller opened his own medical practice in Markle, Indiana, and started a family with wife Mary. Miller and his family moved to Somalia in 1971. Miller served as a doctor at the Jamama Mennonite Hospital from 1971 to 1972 and lived with his family in Mogadishu, Somalia. While he was there, Miller was the only American doctor in Somalia, and was one of a few non- Somali doctors.http://emm.org/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=141:pioneer- missionary-to-somalia-wilbert-lind-dies-the-somalia-challenge- continues&catid;=109:news-and-stories-north-america&Itemid;=124 During this time, Miller was charged with the murder of Hussein Sadad Hassan. Miller plead \\"not guilty\\" on August 25, 1971, and was cleared of all charges before he and his family returned to the United States. Miller also worked with his daughter, Shari Miller Wagner, and wrote A Hundred Camels, published by Cascadia Publishing House in 2009. The book details the time Miller and his family served in Somalia before and during the trial. In 2015, Miller again worked with his daughter, Shari Miller Wagner, and wrote Making the Rounds, published by BookLocker.com. This book details the experiences Miller had while being the doctor for the small town of Markle, Indiana. Miller now lives in Westfield, Indiana, with his family and has retired from the medical profession. Life in Indiana Early on, missionary-minded relatives began to influence Miller and planted ideas of a greater goal in his mind. These relatives, including Orie O. Miller, Jay Hostetler, and Ernest E. Miller watched Miller as he grew in his faith at Forks Mennonite Church in Lagrange County, Indiana where he attended with his family.http://indymenno.org/books.php After receiving his high school degree in 1955,http://www.whmbtv.com/Community/detail- event.cfm?customel_dataPageID_2287=11563 Miller studied for four years at Goshen College, a Mennonite school in Indiana. This continuation of his general education and Mennonite education would aid him in his future trip. During the four years spent focusing on a Pre-Med education, Miller met his wife Mary.http://www.goshen.edu/news/pressarchive/09-24-09-october09-335.html Miller married Mary in 1956, just after their first year of college, creating a partnership that would allow Miller to have a greater impact on those he worked with. The wedding was a traditional Mennonite wedding where rings were absent, but the service vows proved untraditional. Mary omitted the word \\"obey\\" from her vows, possibly accidentally. During their last three years of college, the young couple planted a church in California, Michigan, starting their focus on evangelism early on. The Miller family welcomed their first child, Shari, 18 months after the wedding. Miller began part-time jobs in order to support the family. Miller pursued his medical degree, relocating the family and attending the Indiana University School of Medicine. He graduated from medical school in 1964 and followed with his residency in Fort Wayne, Indiana. After his residency, Miller began a family practice in Markle, Indiana. He was joined by two other physicians: Dr. Lee Kinzer and Dr. Vic Binkley. Miller is also credited with creating the first EMS service in Bluffton, IN at Wells Community Hospital in 1969.http://www.marklemedical.com/about.html Miller and his family received a greater call one day. After much prayer and reflection, the Miller family felt the pull to go to Africa, where they would have the opportunity to spread their faith and help others through the medical knowledge Miller had. Trip to Somalia The Eastern Mennonite Mission contacted Miller after a doctor left the Mennonite Sharati Hospital in Tanzania. Although Miller and his family knew nothing about Tanzania or the mission there, they felt as though they could help. Miller would be filling in for one year while the Board searched for a full-time replacement. Miller's extensive training obstetrics, pediatrics, surgeries, and general medicine would serve him well, but he was still unprepared for the variety of tropical diseases that he would encounter. Six weeks after the Millers signed on, the Board changed Miller's assignment to Jamama Hospital in Somalia, a country whose government was not recognized by the United States. Typically, the missionaries received language training before or during their stay, but the short notice for the Miller family did not allow time for instruction. The Millers were to arrive with no knowledge of the native language. Somalia and the Mennonites Miller arrived in 1961, in 1963, the government outlawed the teaching of any religion other than Islam. This led to the exodus of almost all missions in Somalia, save the Mennonites. For this reason, Somalia was underserviced and the need for medical missionaries was great. Only the Mennonites helped to fulfill this need. Mennonite missions would be required to teach the Qur'an in order to maintain their status in Somalia. The Mennonites worked to maintain their place in Somalia by remaining cooperative. They began teaching English in the missions' schools beginning in the 1960s. Somalia did not have its own written language and did not create one until October 1972. On October 21, 1969, Major General Mohamed Siad Barre overtook the existing government.\\"Political Conditions.\\" Somalia Country Review (2010): 9-41. EBSCO MegaFILE. Web. 16 Dec. 2011.

Oxford University Press, 2000. When Miller and his family arrived in 1969, there were five stable Mennonite missions in Somalia, and few other missions; Miller was the only American doctor there.Study of Mennonite presence and church development in Somalia from 1950 through 1970\\" / David W Shenk. Mennonite Quarterly Review vol. 47, no. 1 (January 1973): pages 62-63. These locations included hospitals, boarding schools, and bookstores. Serving in the mission field, however, was sometimes dangerous. Merlin Grove, a white Mennonite missionary in Somalia during the 1960s, was stabbed to death while on duty in Somalia. This frightened some missionaries into leaving, but Miller and his family chose to continue their path. Life in Somalia Before arriving in Mogadishu, the Millers left their daughters, Shari and Marlis, and Miller's parents at Rosslyn Academy, a boarding school operated by the Mennonites outside of Nairobi. Miller's parents agreed to teach there for three years.http://www.genealogybuff.com/in/in-wells-obits9.htm In doing this, the elder Millers allowed Miller to continue on his journey and focus on the road ahead rather than spending his time raising a family. Miller, Mary, and their son, Stephen continued on to Mogadishu, Somalia. Once the Miller family arrived on August 26, 1971, they met with other missionaries in the city of Mogadishu. Harold Reed, in charge of the Somalia Mennonite Mission at the time, greeted Miller, Mary, and Stephen at the Mogadishu airport. This was not their final destination, however. They traveled on to Jamama, where Chester Kurtz, the Jamama administrator met them to explain their duties. Mary and Stephen often faced xenophobic sentiments when Miller was away at work. While on their way to the store, little children would sometimes throw stones at the four-year-old and his mom, calling them \\"infidels.\\" Mary had no defined work responsibilities but focused on raising Stephen and providing an orderly home life for her family. Miller's primary job responsibility was to manage the Jamama Hospital along with hospital administrator Hassan Nur. Nur worked closely with Miller and the two became good friends. Miller and Nur were not alone, however. They were joined by a team of American and Canadian nurses who worked tirelessly to run the hospital and care for patients. The hospital had 30 beds for patients from around the country. Miller studied tropical diseases, cataract surgery, and leprosy among other things in order to adapt to the needs of the Somalis. He spent his days at the hospital, consulting with patients, performing surgeries, and diagnosing new cases. The Case of Hussein Sadad Hassan The night before Miller and his family arrived in Africa, there was a car wreck on the road between Kismayu and Jamama. Four people were in a Toyota that toppled over‚Äîtwo men and two women. The driver, under the influence of alcohol, was unharmed. His passengers suffered from severe, as well as some minor injuries. Hussein Sadad Hassan, a 46-year-old Somali in a front seat of the car, was the most severely injured passenger. Miller understood immediately after Hassan was admitted to the hospital, that the case would be difficult. Had they been in the United States, it is likely that Miller could have saved Hassan; but under the conditions, his chance of survival was slim. After a few months, Hassan's improvement was minimal. Because Hassan was a government employee, the government took an active interest in his condition and mandated that Miller operate on Hassan's injured femur. Miller performed this surgery on December 14, but due to his weakened state, Hassan's recovery was uncertain. Miller himself had to donate two units of blood because a suitable donor could not be found among Hassan's children. Hassan died a day and a half after the surgery and his children held a traditional funeral service for him. The Murder Trial Only a few weeks after Hassan's death, Miller was greeted at the hospital by a Russian doctor asking for Hassan's hospital records. This visit was followed by one from the prosecutor from Kismayu seeking Miller's license and credentials as a doctor. While these visits seemed to dissolve into nothing, Miller received a telegram from Kismayu's District Court on March 5. This note provided eight days notice before Miller was to appear in court, but it failed to mention the content of the trial. When Miller and his hospital administrator went to inquire, the judge informed them that Miller was being tried for the murder of Hussein Sadad Hassan. Because the United States government did not officially recognize Somalia, Miller could not turn to an embassy.https://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1023.html Instead, he looked to Harold Reed, the Mogadishu mission's administrator. The trial took place on March 23, 1972 at the District Court in Kismayu. There were three defendants in the trial: Miller, the driver of the car Hassan was in, and Dr. Urquhart (the surgeon who first performed on Hassan). Urquhart and the driver were both represented by the same attorney, while Miller was represented by Hassen Scek Ibraham. The trial lasted only one day but was hindered by the language barrier. One witness spoke Russian, Miller spoke English, the judge spoke Somali, the legal reference books were in Italian, and the court records were in Arabic. The translations delayed the process and were difficult for Miller to follow as he spoke only one of the five languages. Ten days after the formal trial, the three defendants returned to hear the judgment. Urquhart and the driver were pronounced innocent of Hassan's murder and Miller was declared guilty. This guilty finding was accompanied by a compensation payment (to Hassan's family) of 100 camels, the typical amount paid for a death, and a three-month stay in jail in Somalia. However, the judge stipulated that if Miller were to continue his work at Jamama and avoid any additional charges, he would not serve the time in jail. After discussing this with Harold Reed and the Mennonite Board in the United States, Miller consented to accepting the charge. The board would pay the family compensation and he would transfer to a hospital in Uganda for the final part of his yearlong service. The Mennonites, traditionally a peaceful people, would respond in accordance with their desire to be cooperative and maintain good relations with the government. When Miller visited Hassan's family to pay amount awarded them, however, they refused to accept the court- ordered compensation and instead asked Miller to appeal the court decision. Miller traveled to the court for a third time. A new judge reviewed the case and interviewed Miller. Two weeks later, Miller received a telegram exonerating him from all charges previously brought against him and pronouncing him innocent. Miller later discovered that the first trial's proceedings were corrupt. Both the judge and the prosecutor were friends of the drunken driver and hoped to place the blame on Miller in order to free their friend. Miller's lawyer Ibraham also revealed to Miller that current Somalia President Siad Barre had asked Ibraham to appeal the case so that Miller could be declared innocent. Six weeks later, Miller and his family returned to the United States. Return to America Miller and his family arrived back in Indiana in 1972, where he returned to his practice. Miller worked to create a long-standing EMT program in Bluffton through the Wells Community Hospital. Miller and Mary are now retired and have traveled to many other Mennonite missions around the world since their time in Somalia. Shari aided Miller in the editing and writing of his book A Hundred Camels: A Mission Doctor's Sojourn and Murder Trial in Somalia. This book details Miller's time in Africa and his trial.http://www.cascadiapublishinghouse.com/ahc/ahc.htm Daughter Shari is now married and works as a poet and editor.http://www.goshen.edu/english/ervinb/bibliographies/menno_us_bib/BeckBib.html Marlis and Stephen continue to be involved in Mennonite missions. The Jamama Hospital has now been converted into a donkey stable after civil war battles ravaged the country. Although the hospital no longer exists, Miller's contributions to the Somali people are still remembered and the unwarranted 1972 trial will actually provide history with a record of Miller and his positive impact on the country. Significance Miller's service in Somalia led to thousands of saved lives and even drew the attention of President Siad Barre. His book has sold around the country and his story is told around the world.http://www.mennonitewriting.org/media/upload/pdf/hundred-camels.pdf His struggles with the murder trial helped to expose corruption in a young government that created a new constitution only a few years later.Osman, Ader. Abdulla. The Constitution of the Somali Republic. 1960. World Constitutions Illustrated. Hein Online. Web. 12 Dec. 2011. The Mennonite Mission in Jamama, although no longer present, continued to thrive after Miller's departure and the Mennonites were accepted by the Somali government due to their cooperative nature, as seen in the Miller's murder trial. Miller is remembered by the Eastern Mennonite Missions for his service in Somalia. Miller also spearheaded the creation of the EMS in Wells County, Indiana that continues to serve the citizens of Wells County.

The site is now a highrise designed by H. Craig Severance. History The Park Theatre opened in 1883 (also known as the New Park Theatre) on the partly demolished site of the Great New York Aquarium (1876‚Äì1881), which is unrelated to the later New York Aquarium. Actor Charles E. Evans, retiring from the stage with cash in hand from the long- running success of A Parlor Match, refurbished the prior Harrigan's Park Theatre as the Herald Square Theatre in 1894.Who's who on the stage, p. 90 (1906) It stood at 1331 Broadway, designed by architects Rose & Stone, with about 1150 seats and with its interior furnished by the interior of the nearby Booth's Theatre, which was being demolished. Lee Shubert took over the lease of the theatre in 1900, making it the first Broadway theatre owned by The Shubert Organization. Partially destroyed by fire and rebuilt, in 1911 it became \\"the first New York theatre to be converted into a silent movie house\\", but it was demolished only three years later, as the Garment District expanded, and the Broadway theater district migrated north of 40th Street.(10 July 1914). The Real Estate Field, The New York Times (\\"The property, on which is the Herald Square Theatre, has a Broadway frontage of 211.5 feet, 207 feet on Thirty-fifth Street and eight-one feet on Thirty-sixth Street.\\") The theatre offered a variety of entertainment, from plays, like Shaw's Arms and the Man (1894), to Edwardian musical comedies, like The Girl from Kay's (1903‚Äì1904) and The Girl Behind the Counter (1907‚Äì1908), to operetta, like Reginald De Koven and Harry B. Smith's Rob Roy. It saw the first performance of the George M.

Czech-designed and constructed, it first flew in April 2010. Design and development The Marabou () was designed and built at the Institute of Aerospace Engineering of Brno University of Technology with support from the Czech Ministry of Industry and Trade and the involvement of industrial partners Jihlavav Airplanes (aircraft), PBS Velk√° Bite≈° (engines) and Plastservis-L (composites). It is specifically designed to provide pilot oversight of the development of an autonomous control system that will allow UAVs to be operated safely in civil r√¥les and airspace. The Marabou is a mid- wing, pod-and-boom style, tandem two-seat aircraft with a pusher configuration single engine and a T-tail. The wings are trapezoidal and with 6¬∞ of dihedral outboard of a brief, constant chord centre section, terminating in winglets. They carry rod actuated ailerons and electrically powered Fowler flaps. The fin and unbalanced, tab-assisted rudder are swept and the tapered tailplane carries a single-piece tapered elevator. All manual controls are integrated in the UAV's own control drives. The outer wing panels and horizontal tail are metal structures; the wing centre section and the vertical tail are composite. Seats are in tandem with the forward one well ahead of the wing and the raised rear seat just forward of its leading edge. The canopy, with a smooth and rising profile, is divided into two single-piece transparencies. A 60 kW (80 hp) Rotax 912 flat-four engine is mounted immediately behind and above the rear seat in pusher configuration. The fuselage is a wholly composite structure. The Marabou has a low tricycle undercarriage with fuselage-mounted, glass reinforced plastic cantilever mainlegs. The nosewheel is steerable and the mainwheels have hydraulic brakes. The first flight was made on 29 April 2010.

The last three Reviewers were Lord Carlile of Berriew CBE QC (2001-2011), a barrister, former Liberal Democrat MP and member of the House of Lords, David Anderson QC (2011-2017), a barrister in private practice who later became a cross-bench peer, and Max Hill QC (2017-2018), a criminal advocate well known for his experience as a prosecutor in terrorism cases. Appointments to the part-time role are now made under the public appointments procedure.Public Appointments Order in Council, April 2013. Functions The Independent Reviewer must report annually to Parliament on the operation of the Terrorism Act 2000. He or she may also report (after notifying the government) on parts of the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001, Part I of the Terrorism Act 2006, the Counter-Terrorism Act 2008, the Terrorist Asset-Freezing etc. Act 2010, the Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures (TPIMs) Act 2011 and Part 1 of the Counter- Terrorism and Security Act 2015.Terrorism Act 2006, section 36; Counter- Terrorism and Security Act 2015, sections 44-45. Further reports may be produced, at the request of the government or on the Independent Reviewer's own initiative. Past examples are the reports into the definition of terrorism (2007), Operation Pathway (2009) and Operation Gird (2011), and reports commissioned into investigatory powers (2015), the collection of bulk data by intelligence agencies (2016), the deprivation of citizenship (2016) and the practice of deportation with assurances (2017). All reports published since 2001 are available on the Independent Reviewer's website. A recent Independent Reviewer has written that \\"anyone who assumes that the Reviewer's function is to torment the government, or conversely to defend it, will be disappointed'\\", adding that he has sought, like his predecessors, \\"only to give an informed, considered and independent view\\". The Independent Reviewer has no permanent staff but has a budget for the assistance of part-time Special Advisers, and administrative help provided or paid for by the Home Office. The Senior Special Adviser has since 2011 been Emeritus Professor Clive Walker of the University of Leeds. The power to set up a Privacy and Civil Liberties Board under the direction and control of the Independent Reviewer was passed into law under the Coalition Government but has not been brought into force. History When IRA terrorism spread to England in the mid-1970s, it was closely followed by UK-wide anti-terrorism laws and by a demand from Parliament that those laws be independently reviewed by a trusted and security-cleared person. Reviews of the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Acts and the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Acts were carried out at various times between 1978 and 1984 by Lord Shackleton, Earl Jellicoe and Sir George Baker. In 1984 an annual review was instituted, in order better to inform the annual renewal debates that were then required. As explained to the House of Lords by Home Office Minister Lord Elton, the reviewer's function was to look at the use made of the statutory powers relating to terrorism and to consider, for example, whether any change in the pattern of their use needed to be drawn to the attention of Parliament. The reviewer was to have access to all relevant papers, including sensitive security information and ministerial correspondence. He or she would not be a judge, but \\"a person whose reputation would lend authority to his conclusions, because some of the information which led him to his conclusions would not be published\\".Hansard HL Deb 8 March 1984 vol 449 col 405 Between 1984 and 2001, annual reports were produced by Sir Cyril Phillips, Viscount Colville and J.J. Rowe QC. On 11 September 2001, a few hours before the attacks on the World Trade Center, Lord Carlile of Berriew CBE QC was appointed as the Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation. The role was first put on a statutory basis in relation to control orders under the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005. Lord Carlile was influential on Government thinking both before and after the 7/7 London attacks of 2005. He held the position for more than nine years, until he was replaced by David Anderson QC on 21 February 2011. Max Hill QC took over the post from 1 March 2017. He continued until 12 October 2018, after which he took up appointment as Director of Public Prosecutions. At the time of his resignation, no appointment process had been launched to find a successor. As of May 2019, Jonathan Hall QC was appointed by the Home Secretary as the new Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation. Influence The distinctiveness of the Independent Reviewer's role has been said to lie in a combination of two factors: complete independence from Government, coupled with unrestricted access to classified material.D.Anderson, \\"The independent review of terrorism laws\\" [2014] Public Law 403-420. These factors in themselves are no guarantee of influence. Past recommendations of the Independent Reviewer have however often been accepted by Government, as may be seen from the academic literatureSee, e.g., C.P. Walker, Terrorism and the Law, Oxford University Press 2011; J. Blackbourn, ‚ÄúIndependent Reviewers as Alternative; an Empirical Study from Australia and the UK‚Äù in Fergal F. Davis and Fiona de Londras (eds), Critical Debates on Counter-Terrorism Judicial Review (Cambridge University Press 2014). and from the responses to the Independent Reviewer's reports that are published on the Reviewer's website. Other recommendations have been taken up by the courtsE.g. Gillan and Quinton v UK [2010] ECHR 28; Elosta v MPC [2013] EWHC 3397; R v Gul [2013] UKSC 64; Beghal v DPP [2015] UKSC 49. or by parliamentary committees.Joint Committee on Human Rights, Post-legislative scrutiny: TPIMs Act 2011 (January 2014); Home Affairs Select Committee, Counter-Terrorism (April 2014). A role similar to that of the Independent Reviewer has been created in Australia, where an Independent National Security Legislation Monitor is provided for by a 2010 statute. In September 2018, the creation of a similar post was recommended by the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland. As Independent Reviewer, David Anderson QC was credited by both Government and opposition front benches with significantly influencing their positions on the legislation that became the Justice and Security Act 2013.Sadiq Khan MP, Hansard HC Deb 4 March 2013, col 687; Lord Wallace, Hansard HL Deb 26 March 2013 col 1061. His reports and evidence to Parliament also influenced the law governing TPIMs, which was reformulated following his confidential report of September 2014 to the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister, the scope of the power to stop and detain travellers under Schedule 7 to the Terrorism Act 2000,Beghal v DPP [2015] UKSC 49. and the practice of asset-freezing. \\"A Question of Trust\\", his June 2015 report on the future of surveillance laws, had a major influence on the Government's draft Investigatory Powers Bill of November 2015, and has been described as \\"the turning point that policymakers have looked for and missed ever since 9/11\\". It was followed in August 2016 by the report of the Independent Reviewer's Bulk Powers Review, which with the help of 60 case studies examined the operational case for the bulk retention of data by MI5, MI6 and GCHQ.

It is the largest and deepest quartzite cave in the world, and second in the country in terms of unevenness. Other caves which are part of the same system have now been partially explored.  History  The beginnings of the Brazilian speleology in the eighteenth and nineteenth century mingle with the history of Cara√ßa. From 1818 reports of two European naturalists, Johann Baptist von Spix and Carl Friedrich Philipp von Martius, cited the existence of several caves in the Serra do Cara√ßa. About this place, it is said that in 1922 the priests of the Cara√ßa College had discovered at the Inficionado peak, which stands above sea level, the Centenary grotto whose first speleological data appeared for the first time only in 1952 when a more technical survey took place resulting in a 3,790 horizontal projection (4,700 linear meters) and a vertical drop of with several entrances, almost always in the form of pits. Six more caves have been explored: Centen√°rio II, with 20 meters of horizontal projection, Centen√°rio III, formed by two parallel galleries connected by a narrow duct, Centum, Bloco Suspenso, which presents small depths of up to 20 meters, Fuma√ßa and Bocaina with 960 meters of horizontal projection (1,200 linear meters) and 304 meters of unevenness. The altitude of these cave mouths range from 2,051 meters at the top slot, 1,958 meters at the usual entrance to the cave to 1,881 meters at the Inficionado abyss. So far three streams have been identified, the Inficionado stream, Chantilly and Arei√£o. All ducts are narrow, ranging between 30 cm and 10 meters for passages that usually lead to the galleries. Their height goes up to tens of meters, although in just a few the ceiling can be seen.

Richard Perryn, 1779 portrait by Thomas Gainsborough. Life The son of Benjamin Perryn of Flint, merchant, by his wife, Jane, eldest daughter of Richard Adams, town clerk of Chester, he was baptised in the parish church of Flint on 16 August 1723. He was educated at Ruthin Grammar School and The Queen's College, Oxford, where he matriculated on 13 March 1741, but did not take any degree. He was admitted a student of Lincoln's Inn on 6 November 1740, and on 27 April 1746 migrated to the Inner Temple, where he was called to the bar on 3 July 1747. Perryn began practice in the court of chancery, and gradually acquired such a reputation there as to be employed during the latter years of his practice in almost every cause. On 20 July 1770 he became vice- chamberlain of Chester, and in the same year was made a King's Counsel and a bencher of the Inner Temple. On 6 April 1776 he kissed hands on his appointment as a Baron of the Exchequer in the place of Sir John Burland, and was knighted on the same day. He was called to the degree of serjeant-at-law and sworn into office on the 26th of the same month. Perryn retired from the bench in the long vacation of 1799, and died at his house at Twickenham on 2 January 1803, aged 79. He was buried on the 10th of the same month in ‚Äòthe new burial-ground‚Äô at Twickenham, and a tablet was erected to his memory in the south chancel wall of the old parish church. Some remarks on Perryn's charge to the grand jury of Sussex at the Lent assizes in 1785 are appended to Thoughts on Executive Justice with respect to our Criminal Laws, particularly on the Circuits, London, 1785.

Ownership Formerly the AMC Kabuki Cinema 8, it was acquired by Robert Redford's Sundance Cinemas chain in 2006 as part of an anti-trust agreement allowing AMC to acquire Loews. Sundance renovated the theater, and reopened it under its current name in December 2007, as the chain's second theater. On October 6, 2015, it was announced that Carmike Cinemas has acquired Sundance Cinemas for $36 million. On November 15, 2016 Carmike was purchased by AMC Theatres (which is owned by the China-based Wanda Group) for $1.2 Billion, bringing the theater back into AMC's control. AMC announced on March 1, 2017 that the Carmike owned brands will be retired and all theaters would be placed under one of three new AMC brands. The Sundance Kabuki as of April 2017 was renamed the AMC Dine-in Kabuki 8. On April 4, 2018 the theater was re branded as the AMC Kabuki 8 and dropped the AMC Dine-in menu. History The theater was the first multiplex in San Francisco. As part of the original Japan Center mission to showcase Japanese culture, it was the first authentic Kabuki theater in America, designed in a traditional 17th century style with a proscenium, stage entrance/exit ramp, revolving stage, and trap doors. The theater was designed with dining tables so audiences could eat while watching Kabuki performances. The restaurant, named the Kabuki Theater Restaurant, was limited to serving Chinese and American food so it would not draw business away from the Japan Center Japanese restaurants. It has hosted San Francisco's Cherry Blossom Festival activities, is one of a small number of theaters showing performances by the San Francisco Opera, and has screened several films for San Francisco International Film Festival and San Francisco International Asian American Film Festival as recently as 2011.

Bledsoe of the Three Circle Ranch. Later, while applying for a post office in 1917, it was discovered that another Texas town was already named Bledsoe, so the name was changed to Becton, after Abner M. Becton, an early settler who donated land for a new school building.Jeanne F.

Today, Becton is primarily a farming community and is surrounded by numerous sections of plowed land. The primary crop is cotton but lesser amounts of grain sorghum and winter wheat are also grown in the area. Crops are grown on a mixture of irrigated and dry-land farms. Water for irrigation is pumped from the underlying Ogallala Aquifer and is applied using center pivot irrigation systems. The aquifer is quickly becoming depleted and, sometime in the future, all farms may have to revert to dry-land cropping systems. With regard to transportation, Becton is located around to the east of Farm to Market Road 400.

In the summer of 1936, Bledsoe School consolidated and was absorbed by the Idalou school district. In 1936, Becton had three businesses, two schools, a church, and a population of 25. In 1946, there were still three businesses, and the population had increased slightly to 150. In 1974, Becton had no businesses and the population decreased to 125.

Although a judge can deny the motion, and chances are he would, this would in effect, allow Karim to address the court and get Loftus' alleged comment on record.\\", Tales From A Trial, Raj Jayadev, San Jose Metro, 1-16-08 It is based on a defendant's claim that the attorney is providing ineffective assistance or has a conflict with the defendant. The name comes from the case People v. Marsden. A defendant is required to know to make a challenge of ineffective assistance of counsel, and make one, or the claim of ineffective assistance of counsel or the issue cannot be raised on appeal. There is no requirement to notify a defendant of such a requirement. A criminal defendant cannot simply fire a court-appointed attorney. The trial judge has discretion whether or not to appoint new counsel on request of the defendant. A Marsden motion is a unique means by which a criminal defendant can communicate with the court. A criminal defendant who is represented by counsel can only communicate with the court through that counsel. Since that counsel's competency or ability to work with the defendant is being challenged, the attorney cannot at the same time defend against and represent the defendant's claims of incompetency or conflict. So the California courts allow a defendant represented by court-appointed counsel to directly communicate with the trial judge in the context of a Marsden motion, and only in such a context. A Marsden motion is a formal request made by a criminal defendant to the court. The court hears arguments on the motion from the defendant and the attorney, without the presence of the prosecutor. The basis for making the motion may be inadequate or incompetent assistance of counsel, legal malpractice, or because there is a conflict between attorney and client that substantially interferes with the attorney representing the client. The defendant must establish either that the representation has been inadequate, or that a conflict makes it likely that it will be inadequate.People v. Barnett (1998) 17 Cal. 4th 1044, 1085People v. Mayfield (1997) 14 Cal.4th 668, 795 In the case of a denial of the motion, the standard of review is abuse of discretion. Essential elements Conflict between client and attorney The language of the Marsden decision contains the sufficient criterion that attorney and defendant are \\"embroiled in such an irreconcilable conflict that ineffective representation is likely to result.\\"People v. Marsden, supra, 2 Cal.3d at p. 123. Inadequacy of representation Marsden case In 1968, Defendant Michael John Marsden was charged and convicted of crimes in California. Marsden appealed the conviction. The only stated basis of the appeal was that he was denied his constitutional right to counsel because his counsel was ineffective. At trial, Marsden complained that his attorney was not adequately representing him before his trial. Marsden asked the court to appoint another attorney. The judge refused to listen to the specific examples Marsden tried to tell the judge. Marsden was convicted, and appealed. The appeals court found that the judge must consider specific examples of inadequate representation before deciding whether or not to appoint a new attorney for a criminal defendant. Marsden requested that his attorney be removed before his trial. He told the trial judge that he was receiving inadequate representation from the attorney. Marsden offered to give the court specific examples. The court would not let Marsden give the specific examples, and denied the motion to have Marsden's attorney removed. In his appeal, Marsden contended that this denial without giving him an opportunity to list specific examples of inadequate representation deprived him of a fair trial. In its opinion, the appellate court cited the case of Gideon v. Wainwright as establishing that criminal defendants who cannot afford counsel are entitled under the constitution to have the court appoint an attorney to be paid for by the government.Gideon v. Wainwright (1963) 372 U.S. 335, 9 L.Ed.2d 799, 83 S.Ct. 792, 93 A.L.R.2d 733 It held that this did not give a defendant the right to hire and fire attorneys beyond this appointment, and left it with the trial court to establish whether or not there is adequate assistance. In other words, the court has discretion as to whether to remove an attorney, not the defendant. However, the appellate court found that in Marsden's case, the trial court could not have properly exercised its discretion without allowing Marsden to specify instances of inadequate representation. The court found that critical information about the adequacy of representation may not be in the court records because of that inadequacy, so a defendant must have a right to specify them, and they must be inquired into by the court. Associated cases Marsden Motion appeals have cited associated cases relevant to application of the Marsden decision. Right to Counsel In Gideon v. Wainright, it was determined that a criminal defendant who cannot afford an attorney is entitled to have a court appoint an attorney, and the government must pay for the attorney. Gideon was one of the bases for the Marsden decision. Incompetent assistance of counsel Conflict with attorney Schell v.

Procedure of hearing Marsden Motion Presence of prosecutor A prosecutor may not be present during a court hearing on a Marsden Motion. How a criminal defendant can file a Marsden Motion Because criminal defendants filing a Marsden Motion are represented by counsel, they cannot directly communicate with the court. Order of hearing during insanity motions When an attorney makes a motion for determination as to whether or not a criminal defendant is competent, a Marsden Motion must be heard before the competency hearing, known as a section 1368 hearing. People v. Stankewitz held that although criminal proceedings must be halted during a hearing for competency, a Marsden Motion is not a criminal proceeding and must be heard first. \\"Hearing a Marsden motion during a competency hearing does not reinstate criminal proceedings against the defendant.\\"FORENSIC MENTAL HEALTH LEGAL ISSUES, Chapter 1, Incompetent to Stand Trial (IST) Commitment, [www.disabilityrightsca.org/pubs/507701%20Ch%201.rtf] From People v.

This is because the court often gives more credibility to attorneys than to criminal defendants, and a successful Marsden Motion may trigger a state Bar investigation if granted based on ineffective assistance. Aram Byer James, a former public defender and watchdog of abuses by the public defender, who teaches defendants and their families how to file a Marsden Motion, emphasises creation of a paper trail as essential to the success of the motion prior to trial, or to basing an appeal on the denial of the motion.

Tiger salamanders are large, with a typical length of 6‚Äì8 inches. They can reach up to 14 inches in length, particularly neotenic individuals. Adults are usually blotchy with grey, green, or black, and have large, lidded eyes. They have short snouts, thick necks, sturdy legs, and long tails. Their diet consists largely of small insects and worms, though it is not rare for an adult to consume small frogs and baby mice. In Idaho, tiger salamanders can be found in suitable habitat in the eastern part of the state, the western edge of the panhandle and in some southwestern areas. Long-toed salamander The long-toed salamander (Ambystoma macrodactylum, Baird 1849)Originally described as Ambystoma macrodactyla. is a mole salamander in the family Ambystomatidae. This species, typically 4.1‚Äì8.9 cm (1 3/5‚Äì3¬Ω in) long when mature, is characterized by its mottled black, brown and yellow pigmentation, and its long outer fourth toe on the hind limbs. The distribution of the long-toed salamander is primarily in the Pacific Northwest, with an altitudinal range of up to . It lives in a variety of habitats including temperate rainforests, coniferous forests, montane riparian zones, sagebrush plains, red fir forests, semi-arid sagebrush, cheatgrass plains, and alpine meadows along the rocky shores of mountain lakes. It lives in slow-moving streams, ponds and lakes during its aquatic breeding phase. The long-toed salamander hibernates during the cold winter months, surviving on protein energy reserves stored in the skin and tail. In Idaho, Long-toed Salamanders are the most widespread salamander species. They are found throughout northern and central Idaho. Idaho giant salamander The Idaho giant salamander, Dicamptodon aterrimus, is one of three closely related species to this taxon: D. ensatus, (California giant salamander), D. copei (Cope's giant salamander) and D. tenebrosus (coastal giant salamander) also known as the (Pacific giant salamander).C. Michael Hogan. 2008 The Idaho giant salamander is the darkest and most intricately blotched of the giant salamanders. Varying between brown, purple, tan, grey, and a copperish color, Idaho giant salamanders are large and robust predators. Tiger Salamanders and Idaho Giant Salamanders have superficial resemblance pertaining to size and shape, but the costal grooves and foot tubercles are significantly different between the two species. With a defining thick head and body along with a fourth toe on the hind foot with only three segments; this species of salamander has its own unique features. Adults are typically 20 cm in lengthRichard Cannings. 2007 but may vary between 7 and 11.75 inches long, but can be observed around 13 inches. The Idaho Giant Salamander is found in forested watersheds from lake Coeur d‚ÄôAlene to the Salmon River. Coeur d'Alene salamander The Coeur d'Alene salamander, (Plethodon idahoensis) is a species of woodland salamander in the family of lungless salamanders (Plethodontidae). This species was once known as Plethodon vandykei idahoensis, a subspecies of Van Dyke's salamander localized in northern Idaho. While the majority of this species is localized in northern Idaho, there are some instances of capture/sighting in western Montana and southeastern British Columbia. Approximately 95% of observed populations in Idaho and Montana have been verified extant since 1987; the remainder may have [extirpated], however there is a general lack of knowledge on the population trends of the Coeur d'Alene salamander. In Idaho the Coeur d'Alene Salamander occurs in the northern part of the state. Rough-skinned newt The rough-skinned newt (Taricha granulosa) is a newt known for its strong poison. Habitats of rough- skinned newts are found throughout the West Coast of the United States and British Columbia. Their range extends south to Santa Cruz, California and north to Alaska. Rough-skinned newts are rare in Idaho and have only been found in several ponds near Moscow, Idaho where they may have been introduced. Tailed frog The tailed frogs (Ascaphus truei) are two species of frogs. The species are part of the genus, Ascaphus is the only taxon in the family Ascaphidae . The \\"tail\\" in the name is actually an extension of the male cloaca. The tail is one of two distinctive anatomical features adapting the species to life in fast-flowing streams. It is the only North American frog that reproduces by internal fertilization. Until 2001, the genus was believed to be monotypic, the single species being the tailed frog (Ascaphus truei Stejneger, 1899). However, in that year Nielson, Lohman, and Sullivan published evidence in Evolution that promoted the Rocky Mountain tailed frog (Ascaphus montanus) from a subspecies to its own species. Since then, the former species has been formally called coastal tailed frog. In Idaho, tailed frogs are found throughout the central and north central forests of Idaho where suitable habitat is found. Boreal chorus frog The boreal chorus frog, (Pseudacris maculata) is a species of chorus frog native to Canada from the west of Lake Superior to western Alberta and north to the North West Territories. It occurs in the USA throughout Montana, northwestern Wisconsin, northeastern Arizona, northern New Mexico and southwestern Utah. This is a small species of frog, reaching about 30mm in length. It is highly variable however it is normally brown, but can be green on the dorsal surface, with 3 broken dorsal stripes, these stripes can be very distinct to quite faint. There is a dark band present from the snout, through the eye and continuing down the side. It has slightly enlarged toes discs to help in climbing small grasses and vegetation. In Idaho, the boreal chorus frog is found in the eastern portion of the state, and along the Snake River plain to the western border of the state. Pacific tree frog The Pacific tree frog (Pseudacris regilla) is a very common species of chorus frog, with a range from the West Coast of the United States (from North California, Oregon, and Washington) to British Columbia in Canada. Living anywhere from sea level up to over 10,000 feet, they are found in shades of greens or browns and even have been known to change between them. They live in many types of habitats and reproduce in aquatic settings. This species is also known as the Pacific chorus frog. In Idaho, the Pacific tree frog is found across much of the western and northern portions of the state. Great Basin spadefoot toad The Great Basin spadefoot (Spea intermontana) is a species of toad in the family Scaphiopodidae. The natural habitats of the Great Basin spadefoot include pinyon-juniper, ponderosa pine, and high elevation spruce-fir forests, semidesert shrubland, sagebrush flats, temperate grasslands, and deserts. They are present in agricultural areas as well. The Great Basin spadefoot can be found from southern British Columbia through the eastern portions of Washington and Oregon and in southern Idaho. Their range extends throughout all of Nevada and into most of Utah; they are also present in small areas in California, Arizona, Colorado, and Wyoming. In Idaho, the Great Basin spadefoot toad is distributed throughout the deserts, prairies of the southern portion of the state. Western toad The western toad or boreal toad (Bufo boreas) is a large toad species, between long, of western North America. It has a white or cream dorsal stripe, and is dusky gray or greenish dorsally with skin glands concentrated within the dark blotches. In Idaho, western toads are widely distributed in and can be found in appropriate habitat throughout most of the state. Woodhouse's toad Woodhouse's toad, (Bufo woodhousii) is a medium-sized () true toad, which is native to the United States and Mexico. There are two recognized subspecies. The epithet woodhousii is in honor of the American physician and naturalist Samuel Washington Woodhouse.http://ebeltz.net/herps/biogappx.html B. woodhousii tends to hybridize with Bufo americanus in their overlapping ranges. In Idaho, Woodhouse's toads occur in the western portion of the state, particularly along the Snake River and its associated drainages. American bullfrog The American bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana),Hillis, D. M. 2007. Constraints in naming parts of the Tree of Life. Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution 42:331‚Äì338.Hillis, D. M., and T. P. Wilcox. 2005. Phylogeny of the New World True Frogs (Rana. Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution 34:299‚Äì314. often simply known as the bullfrog in Canada and the United States, is an aquatic frog, a member of the family Ranidae, or \\"true frogs\\", native to much of North America.Hillis & Wilcox (2005), Pauly et al. (2009) This is a frog of larger, permanent water bodies, swamps, ponds, and lakes, where it is usually found along the water's edge.Conant, 1958 On rainy nights, bullfrogs, along with many other amphibians, travel overland, and may be seen in numbers on country roads. In Idaho, bullfrogs are found in the Snake River Plain in the western portion of the state and in the western part of the panhandle. Columbia spotted frog The Columbia spotted frog (Rana luteiventris) is a North American species of frog. It is a medium-sized frog reaching lengths of up to . Its color ranges from a dark, olive green to light brown with irregularly- shaped black spots on its back and legs (rendering its name). The belly and upper lip are white in color. Individuals can be distinguished from other Rana species by their shorter back legs, narrow snout and upturned eyes. Since they spend most of their time in the water, they also have more webbing in their hind feet than similar species. In Idaho, Columbia spotted frogs are found throughout much of the northern part of the state and some isolated populations in southwestern Idaho. Northern leopard frog The northern leopard frog (Rana pipiens)Pauly et al. (2009)) is a species of Leopard frog from the true frog family native to parts of Canada and United States. The northern leopard frog is a fairly large species of frog reaching about in length. It varies from green to brown in dorsal colour with large dark circular spots on its back, sides and legs. Northern leopard frogs have a wide range of habitats. They are found in permanent ponds, swamps, marshes and slow moving streams throughout forest, open and urban areas. They normally inhabit water bodies with abundant aquatic vegetation. They are well adapted to cold and can be found above asl. This species was once quite common through parts of western Canada until declines started occurring during the 1970s. The population decline is thought to have been caused by pollution drift from the United States falling in the form of acid rain. Many populations of northern leopard frogs have not yet recovered from these declines. In Idaho, they are found throughout much of the southern part of the state along the Snake River plain. Populations also exist in the northern portion of the panhandle. Wood frog The wood frog (Rana sylvatica) has a broad distribution over North America, extending from the southern Appalachians to the boreal forest with several notable disjunct populations including lowland eastern North Carolina. In Idaho, wood frogs are found only in Boundary and Bonner counties.

Northern alligator lizards are medium-sized slender lizards. Adults reach a snout-to- vent length of about and a total length of roughly . They have a distinct skin fold on their sides, separating the keeled scales on the back from the smooth ventral scales. They are brownish in color and often have dark blotches that sometimes blend together into bands. they do some times bite. The belly is light gray. The eyes are dark. The northern alligator lizard occurs along the Pacific Coast and in the Rocky Mountains from southern British Columbia through Washington, northern Idaho and western Montana south through Oregon to the coastal range and the Sierra Nevada in central California. Mojave black-collared lizard The Great Basin collared lizard, (Crotaphytus bicinctores) is a species of lizard known also as the Mohave black collared lizard. It is very similar to the common collared lizard, Crotaphytus collaris, in shape and size, but it lacks the bright extravagant colors. Males can be brown to orange and some red or pink on the belly. Females are more black or dark brown. C. bicintores have elongated scales near the nails and their tail is more triangular in shape than round as with C. collaris. Crotaphytus bicinctores utilizes external energy for their body heat. In Idaho, Mojave black-collared lizards are found in southwestern portion of the state, along the Snake River Plain and surrounding Owyhee foothills. Long- nose leopard lizard The long-nosed leopard lizard, Gambelia wislizenii, is a relatively large lizard ranging from 3 1/4-5 3/4 inches (8.2-14.6 cm). It has a large head, long nose, and a long round tail that can be longer than its body. It is closely related to the \\"blunt-nosed leopard lizard\\" which closely resembles the long-nosed leopard lizard in body proportions, but has a conspicuously blunt snout. They were once considered part of the genus Crotaphytus. The epithet wislizenii is in honor of the German-American surgeon and naturalist Frederick Adolph Wislizenus, who caught the first specimen near Santa Fe, New Mexico. In Idaho the longnose leopard lizard can be found in suitable habitat across much of southern portion of the state. Common sagebrush lizard The sagebrush lizard (Sceloporus graciosus graciosus) is a common lizard found in mid to high latitudes in the Western United States of America. It belongs to the genus Sceloporus (spiny lizards) in the family Phrynosomatidae. Named after the sagebrush plants near which it is commonly found, the sagebrush lizard has keeled and spiny scales running along its dorsal surface. In Idaho, sagebrush lizards can be found in appropriate habitat across most of the southern portion of the state. Short-horned lizard The pygmy short-horned lizard (Phrynosoma douglasii) is a small lizard that occurs in North America. Like other horned lizards, it is often wrongly called the \\"horned toad\\", but it is not a toad at all. It is a reptile, not an amphibian.Sherbrooke, Wade C. \\"Introduction to Horned Lizards of North America.\\" California Natural History Guides, 2003 In Idaho, the pygmy short-horned lizard can be found predominately in southern Idaho, with historic records in northwestern Idaho as well (Nussbaum et al. 1983). Desert horned lizard The desert horned lizard (Phrynosoma platyrhinos) is a species of phrynosomatid lizard native to western North America. They are often referred to as \\"horned toads\\", although they are not toads, but lizards. They typically range from southern Idaho in the north to northern Mexico in the south. There are considered to be two subspecies: the northern desert horned lizard (Phrynosoma platyrhinos platyrhinos) ranging in Idaho, Wyoming, Utah, Nevada, the Colorado front range, and parts of southeastern Oregon; and the southern desert horned lizard (Phrynosoma platyrhinos calidiarum) ranging in southern Utah and Nevada to southeast California, western Arizona, and northern Baja California. In Idaho, desert horned lizards are restricted found only in the southwestern portion of the state. Western skink The western skink (Plestiodon skiltonianus) is a small, smooth-scaled lizard with relatively small limbs, measuring about 100 to 200 mm long. Western skinks are very adaptable. They spend much of their day basking in the sun. Their diet ranges widely, including spiders and beetles. Western skinks will bite if grasped and will flee if they feel threatened. It is a common but secretive species whose range extends throughout Washington, Oregon, Nevada, Utah, and Wyoming and into western Montana and northern Arizona.Stebbins, R.C. 1985. A field guide to western reptiles and amphibians. 2nd ed., revised. Houghton Mifflin, Boston, Massachusetts. 336 pp It is widespread in northern California but restricted to the coast in central and southern California. Found in a variety of habitats, this lizard is most common in early successional stages or open areas of late successional stages. Heavy brush and densely forested areas are generally avoided.Tanner, W.W. 1957. A taxonomic and ecological study of the western skink (Eumeces skiltonianus). Great Basin Nat. 17(3-4):59-94. Western skinks are found from sea level to at least .Zeiner, D.C., W.F. Laudenslayer, Jr., K.E. Mayer, and M. White, eds. 1988. California's Wildlife. Vol. 1. Amphibians and reptiles. Calif. Dept. of Fish and Game, Sacramento, California. 272 pp. This diurnal reptile is active during the warm seasons. In Idaho, western skinks are found across much of the state, with the exception of the southwestern corner, and the southeastern edge of the state. Western fence lizard The western fence lizard (Sceloporus occidentalis) is a common lizard of California and the surrounding area. Because the ventral abdomen of an adult is characteristically blue, it is also known as the blue-belly. Immature western fence lizards have aquamarine-colored bellies. It is a member of the genus Sceloporus, and therefore is a spiny lizard. Although California is the heart of the range of this lizard, it is also found in eastern and southwest Oregon, as well as in the Columbia River Gorge, southwest Idaho, Nevada, western Utah, and northwestern Baja California, and some of the islands off the coast of both California and Baja California.C. Michael Hogan (2008) \\"Western fence lizard (Sceloporus occidentalis)\\", Globaltwitcher, ed. Nicklas Stromberg The western fence lizard occupies a variety of habitats. It is found in grassland, broken chaparral, sagebrush, woodland, coniferous forest, and farmland, and occupies elevations from sea level to 10,800 ft. They generally avoid the harsh desert. In Idaho, western fence lizards are found across the lower, western half of the state. Side-blotched lizard The common side-blotched lizard (Uta stansburiana) is a species of side-blotched lizard common on the Pacific coast of North America, from Washington to western Texas and NW Mexico. It has a peculiar evolutionary strategy following the pattern of the game of rock, paper, scissors, with three types of males existing, each of which applies a different technique to acquire mates (Sinervo & Lively, 1996; Sinervo, 2001; Alonzo & Sinervo, 2001; Sinervo & Clobert, 2001; Sinervo & Zamudio, 2001). The specific epithet, stansburiana, is in honor of Captain Howard Stansbury of the United States Corps of Topographical Engineers, who collected the first specimens while leading the 1849-1851 expedition to explore and survey the Great Salt Lake of Utah.Moll, Edward. 2005. Uta stansburiana, Baird and Girard, 1852 - Common Side-blotched Lizard. Sonoran Herpetologist. In Idaho, side-blotched lizards occur across the southwestern portion of the state. Western whiptail The western whiptail (Aspidoscelis tigris (Baird and Girard, 1852)) is a small lizard (adults average 25 to 35 cm - about a foot - in length) that ranges throughout most of the southwestern United States. Most of its populations appear stable, and is not listed as endangered in any of the states comprising its range. It lives in a wide variety of habitats, including deserts and semiarid shrublands, usually in areas with sparse vegetation; also woodland, open dry forest, and riparian growth. It lives in burrows. Major differences between this species and the checkered whiptail (Aspidoscelis tesselatus) include the lack of enlarged scales anterior to the gular fold and the presence of enlarged antebatrachial scales. It was previously known under Cnemidophorus tigris, until phylogenetic analyses concluded that the genus Cnemidophorus was polyphyletic. Since it does not migrate, a number of forms have developed in different regions, several of which have been given sub-specific names - for example the California Whiptail, Aspidoscelis tigris munda. In Idaho, western whiptails are found only in the southwestern section of the state. Rubber boa The rubber boa (Charina bottae) is a snake in the family Boidae and genus Charina. The family Boidae consists of the non-venomous snakes commonly called boas and consists of 43 species. The genus Charina consists of four species, three of which are found in North America, and one species found in Africa. In Idaho, rubber boas can be found in a variety of habitats, ranging from desert shrub to open pine forest. Often, there is a water source nearby and rocks, woody debris or leaf litter that these snakes use for cover. Rubber Boas are found across the entire state. Eastern racer The eastern racer (Coluber constrictor) is a species of non-venomous, colubrid snakes. They are primarily found throughout the United States, east of the Rocky Mountains, but they range north into Canada, and south into Mexico, Guatemala and Belize. Racers typically grow to around 3¬Ω foot (107 cm) long, but some subspecies are capable of attaining lengths of . Their patterns vary widely between subspecies. Most are solid colored as their common names imply, black racers, brown racers, blue racers or green racers. Runner is sometimes used instead of racer in their common name. In Idaho, the eastern racer is found across most of the state but are not found in the northernmost portion of the state. Ringneck snake The ringneck snake or ring-necked snake (Diadophis punctatus) is a colubrid snake species. It is found throughout much of the United States, central Mexico, and south eastern Canada. Ring-necked snakes are secretive, nocturnal snakes that are rarely seen during the day time. They are slightly venomous but their non- aggressive nature and small rear-facing fangs pose little threat to humans who wish to handle them. They are best known for their unique defense posture of curling up their tails exposing their bright red-orange posterior, ventral surface when threatened. Ring-necked snakes are believed to be fairly abundant throughout most of their range though no scientific evaluation supports this theory. In Idaho, ringneck snakes are found in three isolated populations in the northwest, southwest and southeast portions of the state. Night snake The night snake (Hypsiglena torquata) is a species of rear-fanged, colubrid snake. They are found through the south and western United States, as well as Mexico. The number of subspecies varies depending on the source, but it is generally accepted that there are 17. The night snake has been found as far north as southern British Columbia, and as far south as Guerrero, Mexico. The Eastern range of the night snake extends to Texas. Still, not much is known as far as population densities and exact range due to the highly cryptic nature of the night snake. In Idaho, night snakes are found in the southern portion of the state, and northward along the Snake River to Lewiston, Idaho. Striped whipsnake The striped whipsnake (Masticophis taeniatus) is a species of nonvenomous colubrid snake that is closely related to the California whipsnake (Masticophis lateralis). It is native to the western United States and northern Mexico. The striped whipsnake is found all throughout the western United States and northern Mexico. The farthest north part of their range is in south central Washington and moves south into the great basin between the Cascade-Sierran crest and the continental divide. The range then continues southeast across the continental divide into New Mexico and western and central Texas. The farthest south part of the range lies in Michoacan, Mexico. In the Western United States the range also extends outside of the great basin into the Rogue River Valley in South Western Oregon and Northern California. In Idaho, striped whipsnakes are found in the southwest and south-central portions of the state. Gophersnake The gopher snake, (Pituophis catenifer) is a harmless colubrid species found in North America. Six subspecies are currently recognized, including the nominate subspecies described here. The specific name catenifer is Latin for 'chain bearing', referring to the dorsal color pattern. They can be found in a variety of habitats ranging from desert shrub lands to low mountain areas. Like the racer, gopher snakes are also frequently found in agricultural areas, utilizing the abundant prey available. In Idaho, gopher snakes can be found in appropriate habitat across most of the state, with the exception of the northern portion. Longnose snake The long-nosed snake (Rhinocheilus lecontei) is a species of nonvenomous colubrid snake. It is the only species in the genus Rhinocheilus, but has four recognized subspecies. Its specific name commemorates John Eatton Le Conte (1818-1891). Long-nosed snakes inhabit dry, often rocky, grassland areas of northern Mexico from San Luis Potos√≠ to Chihuahua, and into the southwestern United States, in California, Nevada, Utah, Idaho, Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, Kansas, and Texas. In Idaho, longnose snakes are found in the southwestern desert regions of the state and they may also occur south of Burley, Idaho. Ground snake The western ground snake (Sonora semiannulata) is a species of small, harmless colubrid snake. It is sometimes referred to as the variable ground snake as its patterning and coloration can vary widely, even within the same geographic region. It is native to the southwestern United States, in Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Oklahoma, Colorado, Kansas, Missouri, Utah and California, as well as northern Mexico, in Sonora, Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo Le√≥n, and Durango. In Idaho, western ground snakes are found in the southwestern portion of the state, along the Snake River and surrounding drainages. Common garter snake The common garter snake, (Thamnophis sirtalis) is a snake indigenous to North America. Most garter snakes have a pattern of yellow stripes on a brown background and their average length is about . The common garter snake is a diurnal snake. In summer, it is most active in the morning and late afternoon; in cooler seasons or climates, it restricts its activity to the warm afternoons. In Idaho, the common garter snake is widely distributed in north, north central and southeast Idaho. Terrestrial garter snake The terrestrial garter snake (Thamnophis elegans) is a species of colubrid snake residing only in southwestern Canada, and the western United States. Seven subspecies are currently recognized. Most snakes have a yellow, light orange, or white dorsal stripe, accompanied by two stripes on its side of the same color. Some varieties have red or black spots between the dorsal stripe and the side stripes. This snake often inhabits coniferous forests, and is relatively aquatic. In Idaho, terrestrial garter snakes can be found statewide. (Northern) Pacific rattlesnake The northern Pacific rattlesnake inhabits southern and western regions of the state. The Great Basin rattler is a subspecies found in southern parts of the state. Prairie rattlesnake The prairie rattlesnake (Crotalus viridis) is a venomous pitviper species native to the western United States, southwestern Canada, and northern Mexico. In Idaho, prairie rattlesnakes are found in all but the northern portion of the state, and at high elevations. Western painted turtle The painted turtle (Chrysemys picta) is the most widespread native turtle of North America. It lives in slow-moving fresh waters, from southern Canada to Louisiana and northern Mexico, and from the Atlantic to the Pacific. The turtle is the only species of the genus Chrysemys, which is part of the pond turtle family, Emydidae. In Idaho, painted turtles can be found in the northern portion of the state, and have been reported in western Idaho in waters associated with the Payette and Boise Rivers, and in eastern Idaho near St. Anthony.

He was elected Lord Mayor of London in 1680, a period when the City of London was in conflict with the Crown. Early life He was the son of Thomas and Elizabeth Ward of Tanshelf, near Pontefract and was born there on 7 December 1629; he received the name of Patience from his father, who was disappointed at not having a daughter. He lost his father at the age of five, and was brought up by his mother for the ministry. He was sent to university in 1643, under the care of a brother-in-law, but then turned his attention to commerce. In business On 10 June 1646 he was apprenticed for eight years to Launcelot Tolson, merchant-taylor and merchant-adventurer, of St Helen's, Bishopsgate, with whom he lived until his marriage. He later set up in business for himself in St. Lawrence Pountney Lane, where he occupied a portion of the ancient mansion variously known as 'Manor of the Rose' and Poultney's Inn, the house having formerly belonged to Sir John Pulteney (Poultney):Gatehouse page. the house is shown in Ogilby and Morgan's 'Map of London,' 1677, and in the plan of Walbrook and Dowgate wards in Noorthouck's 'New History of London' (p. 612). On completing his apprenticeship he became a freeman of the Merchant Taylors' Company, but there was a difficulty about his taking up his livery; in the end he paid a fine. He became master of the company in 1671. In politics He was elected sheriff on midsummer day 1670, and on 18 October in the same year became alderman for the ward of Farringdon Within. At the mayoralty banquet on 29 October 1675, which the king honoured with his presence, Ward, with other aldermen, was knighted. He was elected lord mayor on Michaelmas day 1680, and entered into office on 29 October following. In his election speech he maintained Protestant principles. The pageant was arranged by Thomas Jordan the city poet; it was of great magnificence, and was provided at the cost of the Merchant Taylors' Company. Ward's sympathies, like those of his colleague Sir Humphrey Edwin, were strongly opposed to the high-church party, and probably inclined to the dissenters. On 28 March 1681 the king dissolved his third short parliament, and on 13 May the common council, by a narrow majority of fourteen, agreed to address the king, praying him to cause a parliament to meet, and continue to sit until due provision were made for the security of his majesty's person and his people. Ward, who sided with the opposition, had the unthankful task of presenting this address, and the first attempt to do so failed, the deputation being told to meet the king at Hampton Court on 19 May. When that day arrived the civic deputation were summarily dismissed. Ward, however, received a vote of thanks from the grand jury at the Old Bailey for the part he had taken in presenting the address. He received further thanks from the common hall on 24 June, and was desired to present another address to the king, assuring his majesty that the late address truly reflected the feeling of that assembly. This address, presented on 7 July, was received poorly, Ward and his colleagues being again told to mind their own business. The extreme Protestantism of the city, probably directed by Ward, had early in his mayoralty led to an additional inscription being engraved on the Monument to the Great Fire of London stating that the fire of London had been caused by the papists; and a further inscription to the same effect was ordered to be placed on the house in Pudding Lane where the fire began. Thomas Ward in his England's Reformation (1710, canto iv. p. 100), speaking of Titus Oates and the fabricated Popish Plot, wrote also against Sir Patience. The court party succeeded this year in turning their opponents out of the city lieutenancy, and the lord mayor lost his commission as a colonel of a regiment of the trained bands. At the close of his mayoralty Ward was succeeded by Sir John Moore, a partisan of the court, after the unusual resort to a poll. One of the final incidents in Ward's mayoralty was the resolution of the corporation to undertake the business of fire insurance on behalf of the citizens. In exile Ward became a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1682. On 19 May 1683 he was tried for perjury in connection with the action brought by James, Duke of York against Sir Thomas Pilkington for scandalum magnatum. He was accused of having sworn that to the best of his remembrance he did not hear the words spoken which were said to be criminal. After much conflicting evidence he was found guilty and fled to Holland. During his exile abroad he was in constant communication with Thomas Papillon, the sheriff-elect of 1682, who had also been driven into exile. A portion of their correspondence is printed by Mr. A. F. W. Papillon in his 'Memoirs of Thomas Papillon' (1887, pp. 336‚Äì347). On 10 February 1688 Ward pleaded his majesty's pardon by attorney for his conviction of perjury. Under William and Mary The accession of William III restored him to full favour and honour. He was elected one of the four city members to serve in the convention summoned to meet on 22 January 1689. At the next election, in February 1690, Ward and the other three whig candidates lost their seats. He was appointed colonel of the blue regiment of the trained bands on 31 March 1689, and on 19 April a commissioner for managing the customs. He lost his colonelcy in 1690, the church party being once more in a majority, but was re-elected on the ascendency of the whigs in 1691. On 24 March 1695‚Äì6 he was compelled through illness to give up his office of commissioner of customs, but recovered sufficiently to resume his duties on 9 April. Ward died on 10 July 1696, and was buried in the south corner of the chancel of St Mary Abchurch, where a mural monument to his memory was set up. His arms were azure, a cross patonce or. There was a full-length portrait of Ward in his mayoral robes at Merchant Taylors' Hall, and a small watercolour copy in the Guildhall Library. Family Ward married, on 8 June 1653, Elizabeth, daughter of William Hobson of Hackney. His wife predeceased him during his exile on 24 December 1685, and was buried in the 'great church at Amsterdam.' There was no issue of the marriage, but Sir Patience left his manor of Hooton Pagnell to his grand-nephew, Patience Ward, in whose family it still remains. His nephew, Sir John Ward, son of his brother, Sir Thomas Ward of Tanshelf, was Lord Mayor in 1714, and ancestor of the Wards of Westerham in Kent.

Regardless of which one, both the six-pointed star and the eight-pointed star are also known as kagome. It can be found in many of the oldest Shinto shrines, dating back to at least the 5th century BCE, and is present on almost all the stone lanterns approaching the Ise-jingu.

Based on the Agosta 90Bravo/Khalid-class design, she was the first submarine that was first designed and constructed in Cherbourg in France by the French contractor, the DCNS for the Pakistan Navy, as part of contract for three Agosta‚Äì90B submarines signed on 21 September 1994. Khalid, according to the Pakistan Navy, is the forerunner of her class and capable for her long range missions in the Indian Ocean. Construction and design development After the series of complicated and lengthy negotiations between the governments of Pakistan and France, the Pakistan Navy placed an order for the submarine in September 1992 with confirmation being approved on 21 September 1994. She was designed and constructed by the French contractor, DCNS, in Cherbourg in France and was laid down on 15 July 1995. Her launch took place on 18 December 1998 in Cherbourg, and underwent through several sea trials by the French Navy before being sent to Karachi, Sindh in Pakistan. The hull is made of 80 HLES high elasticity steel, a similar material used in nuclear submarines, allowing the submarine to give greater depth in sea. Furthermore, the automatic control system and automation further reduces the need of crew, restricted her military staff to 36 personnel. On 6 September 1999, she was commissioned in the Navy with Chairman joint chiefs, General Pervez Musharraf, witnessing the commissioning ceremony and presented the submarine with her colors. She was named after Khalid ibn al-Walid, one of the most respected and successful military commanders of Islam. About her commissioning, the Indian naval chief, Admiral Sushil Kumar, reportedly quoted that the \\"Khalid had given an edge over India.\\" The commissioning of the submarine was a watershed event in the country with the political elite giving credit to former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. Khalid was officially inducted in the Navy on 21 December 1999. In 2011, she underwent with overhauling, and retrofitted her propulsion system with the air-independent propulsion (AIP) systems by the technicians at the KESW Ltd. On 6 March 2018, the DCNS, its original builder, lost the bidding competition with the Turkish firm, STM, for its refitting and upgradation of her weapon system, combat control system, missile rooms, and periscope upgrades, and is slated to return to her active service in 2020 after returning from Turkey.

Design overview PNS Hamza was ingeniously designed and built by the KESW Ltd. at the Karachi Naval Dockyard, with the participation of more than 300 civilian engineers and technicians trained in France's defense industry. In 1999‚Äì2004, the French and other European contractors reportedly trained more than 600 Pakistani machinists and metal workers in various construction skills of the submarine to meet the challenges of modern warfare in which submarines play a vital role.

PNS Hamza is the most advanced version of the design and is more advanced than her two sister ship, and Saad, as its outer hull is light steel structure, HLES 80, was built at the Pakistan Steel and fabricated at the Naval Dockyard in Karachi in element parts and mounted on the inner pressure hull. The pressure hull section was fabricated and outfitted by the Naval Dockyard in collaboration with the Karachi Shipyard. PNS Hamza was laid down on 1 March 1997 in Karachi, and the steel cutting started by the Pakistan Steel Mills. The construction of the submarine started in 1998 by KESW Ltd. at the Karachi Naval Dockyard, followed by fabrication of 12 pressure hull sub-sections and culminating into three pressure hull sections. This was followed by mounting of light bulkheads, internal tanks and ballast panels in August 2003.

It is calculated by dividing the number of students who choose to enroll at a school in a given year, which is often based on their decision to pay a deposit, by the total number of offers of acceptance sent. A higher yield indicates greater interest in enrolling at a particular school of higher education. The yield rate is usually calculated once per year based on admissions statistics. As a statistical measure, it has been used by college ratings services as a measure of selectivity, such that a higher yield rate is a sign of a more selective college. For example, the yield rate for Princeton University was 69% in 2016, while the yield rate for Dartmouth was 55%, and the yield rate for Colorado College was 37%. The yield rate has been sometimes criticized for being subject to manipulation by college admissions staffs; in 2001, a report in the Wall Street Journal by reporter Daniel Golden suggested that some college admissions departments reject or wait list well-qualified applicants on the assumption that they will not enroll, as a way to boost the college's overall yield rate; according to the report, these actions are part of an effort to improve a college's scores on the US News college ranking.

Like computational chemistry or computational physics, it is both a specific branch of theoretical astrophysics and an interdisciplinary field relying on computer science, mathematics, and wider physics. Computational astrophysics is most often studied through an applied mathematics or astrophysics programme at PhD level. Well-established areas of astrophysics employing computational methods include magnetohydrodynamics, astrophysical radiative transfer, stellar and galactic dynamics, and astrophysical fluid dynamics. A recently developed field with interesting results is numerical relativity. Research Many astrophysicists use computers in their work, and a growing number of astrophysics departments now have research groups specially devoted to computational astrophysics. Important research initiatives include the US Department of Energy (DoE) SciDAC collaboration for astrophysics\\"SciDAC Astrophysics Consortium\\". Accessed 8 Mar 2012. and the now defunct European AstroSim collaboration.AstroSim.net . Accessed 8 Mar 2012. A notable active project is the international Virgo Consortium, which focuses on cosmology. In August 2015 during the general assembly of the International Astronomical Union a new commission C.B1 on Computational Astrophysics was inaugurated, therewith recognizing the importance of astronomical discovery by computing. Important techniques of computational astrophysics include particle-in-cell (PIC) and the closely related particle-mesh (PM), N-body simulations, Monte Carlo methods, as well as grid-free (with smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) being an important example) and grid-based methods for fluids. In addition, methods from numerical analysis for solving ODEs and PDEs are also used. Simulation of astrophysical flows is of particular importance as many objects and processes of astronomical interest such as stars and nebulae involve gases. Fluid computer models are often coupled with radiative transfer, (Newtonian) gravity, nuclear physics and (general) relativity to study highly energetic phenomena such as supernovae, relativistic jets, active galaxies and gamma-ray burstsBreakthrough study confirms cause of short gamma-ray bursts.

In recent years the field has made increasing use of parallel and high performance computers.Lucio Mayer. Foreword: Advanced Science Letters (ASL), Special Issue on Computational Astrophysics. Tools Computational astrophysics as a field makes extensive use of software and hardware technologies. These systems are often highly specialized and made by dedicated professionals, and so generally find limited popularity in the wider (computational) physics community. Hardware Like other similar fields, computational astrophysics makes extensive use of supercomputers and computer clusters . Even on the scale of a normal desktop it is possible to accelerate the hardware. Perhaps the most notable such computer architecture built specially for astrophysics is the GRAPE (gravity pipe) in Japan. As of 2010, the biggest N-body simulations, such as DEGIMA, do general-purpose computing on graphics processing units.Hamada T., Nitadori K.

In Proceedings of the 2010 ACM/IEEE International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis (SC '10). IEEE Computer Society, Washington, DC, USA, 1-9. Software Many codes and software packages, exist along with various researchers and consortia maintaining them. Most codes tend to be n-body packages or fluid solvers of some sort.

It is located in the Sugarloaf Valley just north of Buck Mountain between Interstate 81 and Route 309. It uses the Drums zip code of 18222.  Kis-Lyn School for Boys  From 1912 to 1965 a reform school known as the Kis- Lyn School for Boys operated in the village. The boys' school housed boys who committed non violent offenses and offered a full high school curriculum. Boys lived in cottages which were run by married couples who were responsible for overseeing the boys when they were not in school or performing chores. Each cottage specialized in different projects on the farm: one cottage handled laundry while others handled farm chores, the dairy barn, the kitchen, and the hen house, respectively. The boys slept in dormitory style conditions and ate at communal tables. Much of the food provided was raised on the farm. A typical breakfast consisted of hot cereal fortified with raisins, hot rolls and fresh milk. At lunch and dinner soups, stews, pasta, meats and fresh fruit was served. Boys who met the conduct code were allowed visitors once a month and were allowed to leave the farm with their parents or sponsors for the day. Boys were also allowed to bring back personal items such as candy, peanut butter and other edible items. During the Summer each cottage was allowed to use the pool, play baseball and other sports. In Winter, during school time, the boys played basketball, staged talent shows and plays or joined the Boy Scouts. Boys were allowed to watch TV and were taken on occasion to events outside the facility like the circus. The average stay at Kis-Lyn was one year with some boys being released earlier when proper homes were found for them or when their home life stabilized. Many boys at Kis-Lyn were there because of poor living conditions at home while others were there for low level crimes such as shoplifting. The school was open to boys of all races and religions with boys coming from all over the state of Pennsylvania including the urban areas of Philadelphia, Reading, Harrisburg and Pittsburgh. For most boys it was their first exposure to any type of farm life.

It is the first of three Tamil Sangams of Classical Tamil literature. While most historians accept the historicity of this literature, they also understand that some literary academies would have held Pandyan patronage. This is not to be confused with the historical Third Sangam period which lasted roughly from 600 BCE to 300 CE.

However, this is unlikely as the first mention of him is from Ptolemy and no Sangam work refers to him. A more likely proposition is Lord Muruga (Kartikeya) being the head of the First Sangam as believed by others. ‡Æö‡Æø‡Æµ‡Æ©‡Øç (sivan) in Tamil means 'the red one'. Activity Its function was to judge literary works and credit their worth. Later literary works like Iraiyanar Akaporul mention that 549 poets were members of it including Shiva, Murugan, Kuperan and seven Pandya kings. And 16,149 authors attended the convocation.

This image was taken by while pulling away during STS-119. Skylab viewed from the command module of Skylab 2 A space station is a crewed satellite designed to remain in low Earth orbit for a long period of time. In general, space stations have the ability for other spacecraft to dock to them. As of , the International Space Station is the only operational crewed space station currently in orbit. Other experimental and prototype labs are also in orbit. Previous stations include the Salyut and Almaz series, Skylab, Mir and the Tiangong series. Space stations are used to study the effects of long-term space flight on the human body. They also serve as a platform for extended scientific studies. All space stations have been designed with the intention of rotating multiple crews, with each crew member staying aboard the station for weeks or months, but rarely more than a year. As of today, Vladimir Titov, Musa Manarov, Sergei Avdeyev and Valeriy Polyakov have completed single missions of over a year, all aboard Mir. Space stations have been used for both military and civilian purposes. The first military-use space station was Salyut 2, which was launched by the Soviet Almaz program in 1973. The Soviet Union also claimed the first civilian space station with the launch of Salyut 1. As of Russia, China, India and private companies are developing space stations.  Past stations  These stations have re-entered the atmosphere and disintegrated. The Soviet Union ran two programs simultaneously in the 1970s, both of which were called Salyut publicly. The Long Duration Orbital Station (DOS) program was intended for scientific research into spaceflight. The Almaz program was a secret military program that tested space reconnaissance. = Never crewed { class=\\"sortable wikitable plainrowheaders\\" - ! scope=\\"col\\"  Name ! scope=\\"col\\"  Entity ! scope=\\"col\\"  Program ! scope=\\"col\\"  Crew size ! scope=\\"col\\"  Launched ! scope=\\"col\\"  Reentered ! scope=\\"col\\"  Days in orbit ! scope=\\"col\\"  Days occu- pied ! scope=\\"col\\"  Total crew and visitors ! scope=\\"col\\"  Number of crewed visits ! scope=\\"col\\"  Number of robotic visits ! scope=\\"col\\"  Mass (* = at launch) ! scope=\\"col\\"  Pressurized volume - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Salyut 1   DOS  align=\\"center\\"   align=\\"center\\"   align=\\"center\\"         - style=\\"background:#fdd\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"background:#fdd\\"  DOS-2  USSR  DOS  align=\\"center\\"  ‚ÄîThe USSR intended to crew these stations with 2 men, however they re-entered the atmosphere before the cosmonauts were launched.          - style=\\"background:#fdd\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"background:#fdd\\"  Salyut 2  USSR  Almaz  align=\\"center\\"  ‚Äî  align=\\"center\\"   align=\\"center\\"         - style=\\"background:#fdd\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"background:#fdd\\"  Kosmos 557  USSR  DOS (Full text available on Wikisource)  align=\\"center\\"  ‚Äî  align=\\"center\\"   align=\\"center\\"         - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Skylab  NASA  Skylab  align=\\"center\\"   align=\\"center\\"   align=\\"center\\"         - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Salyut 3  USSR  Almaz  align=\\"center\\"   align=\\"center\\"   align=\\"center\\"         - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Salyut 4  USSR  DOS  align=\\"center\\"   align=\\"center\\"   align=\\"center\\"         - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Salyut 5  USSR  Almaz  align=\\"center\\"   align=\\"center\\"   align=\\"center\\"         - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Salyut 6  USSR rowspan=\\"3\\" DOS  align=\\"center\\"   align=\\"center\\"   align=\\"center\\"         - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Salyut 7  USSR  align=\\"center\\"   align=\\"center\\"   align=\\"center\\"         - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Mir   align=\\"center\\"   align=\\"center\\"   align=\\"center\\"         - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Tiangong-1  CNSA rowspan=\\"2\\"  Tiangong program  align=\\"center\\"  3  align=\\"center\\"  29 September 2011  align=\\"center\\"  2 April 2018  2377  25  6Shenzhou 10#Crew  2  1   - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Tiangong-2  CNSA  align=\\"center\\"  2  align=\\"center\\"  15 September 2016  align=\\"center\\"  19 July 2019  1037  26  2  1  1   } Note: Prototypes and various parts of Chinese, Japanese, and Russian, U.S. programs are in orbit, but not necessarily operational.

Utilizing both written material (downloadable from the web) and DVD- based input from \\"some of the most outspoken and respected voices in today's theological circles\\", LtQ curricula seek to expose lay people to the complex theological questions and perspectives that are taught in seminaries but that often don't \\"trickle down\\" into the local churches. The programs do not aim to spell out new doctrine or to develop new dogma, but to resource people who are in the midst of a lifelong conversation about the mysteries of faith and life.

After severe flood damage it was abandoned in 1701 and later replaced at a different location in 1843. Early history St Mary's was founded as a Benedictine priory in the 1080s, by Robert Fitzhamon Genuki quotes from The Old Parish Churches of Gwent, Glamorgan & Gower (1991), by Mike Salter. (also founder of Tewkesbury Abbey in 1092). However, the site next to the River Taff was a poor one, susceptible to both continual flooding and river erosion. Even after stabilising the foundations, bodies from burials would regularly be washed down the river. The abbey withdrew the monks in 1211. Destruction In 1607, the area of England and Wales bordering the Bristol Channel experienced a devastating flood, now believed to have been a tsunami. The Bristol Channel floods washed away much of St Mary's foundations and it slowly began to collapse. In 1620, the decision was made to make St John's the main parish church, which was originally just an offshoot development. The two churches were worked as one parish, with all burials and some services continuing at St Mary's. In 1638, the vicar of St Mary's, William Erbery, was forced to resign, his curate Walter Cradock had his licence revoked, and senior members of the congregation were barred from the premises after they refused to read the Book of Sports. These people, together with others of a similar mind, formed the core of a new congregation that, after the English Civil War and subsequent Restoration, in 1696 were granted land in Womanby Street which allowed them to build the first Trinity Church (later known as a Presbyterian chapel). By 1678, with evidence from the visit of Francis Place and later essays from the Celtic scholar Edward Lhuyd, both described St Mary's as being in ruins. The tower collapsed in 1680 and the last recorded burial in the churchyard took place in 1698. The last service was held in a roofless ruin in 1701, after which St Mary's was abandoned. Replacement and later developments Bute Street In 1843, John Crichton- Stuart, 2nd Marquess of Bute donated the land for the construction of the Church of St. Mary the Virgin ( but did not pay for the construction that was by public appeal for funds) and St. Stephen the Martyr, in Bute Street as a permanent replacement. The 1843 church was designed by Thomas Foster of Bristol. The east end (by J. D. Sedding) was added in 1884, later enlarged in 1907. Wall paintings decorate the chancel arch. The church is a Grade II listed building. The River Taff was diverted in 1850 (by Isambard Kingdom Brunel) to create a site to build the Cardiff Central railway station, also resulting in the creation of Westgate Street. The Theatre Royal (later the Prince of Wales theatre) was built on the site of the old church in 1878. This is now the location of the current Prince of Wales public house. The outline of a Gothic church was included on one wall of the theatre, denoting its location on the St Mary's church site.

It was at the intersection of Nassau and Spruce Streets, at 154 Printing House Square. Part of the former \\"Newspaper Row\\", it operated as the headquarters of the New-York Tribune from 1875 to 1923. The Tribune Building contained a facade of brick and masonry, with a clock tower at the top. The building was originally ten stories high, including a mansard roof, and measured tall to its pinnacle. It was expanded in the 1900s to nineteen stories, with an enlarged mansard roof and a pinnacle height of . The Tribune Building was one of the first high-rise elevator buildings and an early skyscraper. Its design was mostly negatively criticized during its existence. The Tribune Building, on the site of two previous Tribune buildings, was announced in 1873 and completed in 1875 to designs by Richard Morris Hunt. It was a ten-story building when it opened, making it the second-tallest building in New York. Hunt's original design was not completed until 1882, when the building was extended to cover a larger lot area. Between 1905 and 1907, the mansard roof was removed and ten more floors were added by the architects D'Oench & Yost and L. Thouyard. The Tribune Building served as the Tribune headquarters until 1922, but also housed office tenants, as well as the early classrooms of Pace University. It was demolished in 1966 to make room for Pace's 1 Pace Plaza building, and few remnants of the Tribune Building exist.  Site  The New York Tribune Building was at 154 Printing House Square (also known as 154 Nassau Street), at the northeast corner of Nassau and Spruce Streets in the Financial District of Manhattan. The site was \\"L\\" shaped, with an arm on Spruce Street running east from Nassau Street and then northward to Frankfort Street. When completed, it had frontage of about on Nassau Street to the west, about on Spruce Street to the south, and on Frankfort Street to the north, with a depth of between Frankfort and Spruce Streets. The Tribune site was formerly three separate land lots, which were combined into one lot under Tribune ownership. The New York World Building, headquarters for the New York World, was located one block north. Adjoining the building to the south was the New York Times Building and the American Tract Society Building. In addition, the building sat across from City Hall and the Civic Center to the west.  Design  The New York Tribune Building was originally a ten-story brick and masonry structure designed by Richard Morris Hunt and opened in 1875 as the headquarters of the New-York Tribune. Originally, the building stood tall, including a clock tower, which made the Tribune Building the second-tallest in New York City, after Trinity Church. Edward E. Raht supervised the construction of the original section of the building for Hunt, and was also listed as the architect of an 1882 addition to the building, which was part of Hunt's original plans. The Tribune Building reached its maximum size in 1907, after D'Oench & Yost and L. Thouyard removed the mansard roof, added ten stories to the existing building, and built a 19-story annex in a similar style on Frankfort Street. The expanded structure contained a glazed-brick light shaft on the eastern side, which measured square. As completed, the building measured to the finial of the tower. Multiple contractors provided the material for both the original structure and its additions. The granite foundation, masonry, concrete, glass, plastering, tiling and marble work, iron, slate, window shutters, and woodwork were all supplied by different companies. Other contractors were hired to install the steam heating, elevators, plumbing, gas, light, pneumatic-tube, and speaking- tube systems.  Facade  alt= As originally built, the facade contained projecting piers made of Croton pavers' brick laid in Portland cement, while the inner walls were made of Haverstraw brick laid in Rosendale cement. The piers divided each elevation into bays. There were four bays each on Frankfort, Spruce, and Nassau Streets, and each bay typically had three windows per floor. On Nassau Street, the second bay from south was two windows wide, projected approximately , and contained a campanile-like clock tower measuring square. Additionally, because of the shape of the site, the Nassau Street elevation was bent slightly outward: the two northern bays of that elevation, north of the clock tower, were oriented further northwest than the two southern bays. There was a bulletin board on the Nassau Street elevation, which would display major headlines to crowds in City Hall Park. The raised basement and the first story were clad with granite blocks. The main entrance at Nassau Street, at the base of the clock tower, was flanked by large polished Quincy granite columns. Bold string courses wrapped above the first and second floors. The second through eighth stories, as built, were composed mostly of Baltimore front brick in black mortar; granite trimming was used around windows, cornices, and towers. The facade also contained geometrical designs in white, black, and red brick. The second through fourth, and the fifth through seventh floors were treated as a single group, with string courses above the fourth and seventh stories. The fourth story was topped by flat arches and the seventh story was encircled by smaller polished granite columns. These divided the facade into a series of stacked flat-arched arcades. A projecting granite cornice ran above the seventh floor, while the eighth story had granite mullions between each set of windows. The original ninth and tenth floors were enclosed in the mansard roof, with dormer windows. The tenth floor was an attic, no more than tall, and housed the original ventilation equipment, elevator machinery, and water tanks. The original clock tower had a granite balcony above the sidewalk, and four clock faces measuring in diameter. Within the clock tower, there were three additional stories above the eighth floor, but they were used for storage. The main roof topped out at above ground level. The clock tower rose to , including a pyramidal roof of and a finial of iron. Following its 1907 expansion, the building was nineteen stories tall. The design of the lowest eight stories was kept largely intact, and continued upward with modifications to the sixteenth story, and there was a three-story mansard roof at the top. Granite window trimmings were present only on the first nine stories. The roof of the expanded building was encircled by an copper rail at its top. The roof of the clock tower was rebuilt exactly as it had been in the original construction. The flat roof above most of the building was above the sidewalk, while the clock tower was above the sidewalk. The finial of the expanded clock tower rose to , and contained a copper weather vane.  Foundation  The foundation piers of the original building and its 1881 addition rested on sand below grade, and the underlying bedrock layer was . The foundation walls rested on a concrete bed wide by thick, located below grade. The concrete bed was made of a mixture of cement, sand, gravel, and stone; it was a relatively new method of foundation engineering in the city at the time, as it was both quick to harden and extremely solid once hardened. Above the concrete bed was a course of granite slabs measuring thick and between wide. The foundation walls themselves were thick and made of fine brick in Portland cement. Immediately above the foundation bed was a cellar, with a vault for printing machinery. The foundation of the 1907 addition on Frankfort Street used steel sheet pilings. The piles weighed and were driven very close to the original foundation walls, with the tops of the piles carried to above the bottoms of the old footings.  Features  = Structural features = The original building's exterior walls were load-bearing, and were comparatively thick at the base, tapering at a rate of for every subsequent floor above ground level. The clock tower's walls measured from thick at the base to thick below the clock faces. The main facade's walls ranged from thick, and the rear and north walls were between thick. The southern partition wall of the clock tower had a thickness of at the base and at the top. The windows were installed near the outer faces of the exterior walls, and so they were deeply recessed from the inside, especially at the lower stories. The upper ten stories contained a steel skeleton frame, as did the 1907 addition along Frankfort Street. The masonry construction of the original building was deemed to be strong enough to support the steel skeleton of the extra floors. The interior was designed to be fireproof, and contained iron floor beams that generally spaced apart. Flat arches, made of hollow concrete blocks, were placed between each set of beams, molded into angled blocks to resemble voussoirs. The vertical supports were made of masonry and brick, rather than of iron, because of the perceived fire risk of iron columns. The floors were covered in tile, while the interior partition walls were made of tile or plaster. The staircases were made of cast iron and had stone treads. Wood was only used as a decorative element in offices, a step perceived at the time to eliminate fire risk. These structural features were also included in the 1882 extension of the building to Frankfort Street. = Interior = An interior corridor seen in 1966, just before demolition When the building was opened in 1875, the first floor was reached by a flight of nine steps within a vestibule just inside the main entrance. The main entrance vestibule contained a brick ceiling with marble groin vaulted ribs. The first-floor space at the corner of Spruce and Nassau Streets was occupied by the Tribune counting room; the space had a marble counter extending the length of the room. As completed in 1882, the building had 150 rooms available for rent on the basement and the second through eighth stories. The main hallways on each floor contained tile floors and blue-gray marble wainscoting on the walls. Ceiling heights generally decreased at higher stories: the cellar's ceiling was high and the first floor had a ceiling of , but the eighth-floor ceiling was high. The original ninth story under the mansard roof, with a ceiling of , had the editorial, composing, proof, and stereotype rooms of the Tribune. Three elevators were provided in the original design. Two on Nassau Street were included in the initial section that opened in 1875, and the other was added as part of the 1882 expansion to Frankfort Street. A pneumatic tube system was also installed so that documents could be shipped between floors, and radiators were installed in each room. In the 1907 expansion, the Tribune facilities were moved to the first and second floors, to be closer to the pressrooms in the basement. The first-floor counting room was largely unchanged. On the upper floors, there were 535 rooms made available for rent. Two staircases and eight hydraulic elevators were added, while the two original elevators on Nassau Street were removed and made into a light court. The steps at the entrance vestibule were removed to provide a direct connection to the eight new elevators. Four of the eight new elevators served all the stories; three connected the lobby with the eleventh through nineteenth stories; and the last elevator ran only to the twelfth floor. The Frankfort Street elevator was retained as a freight elevator.  History  Starting in the early 19th century and continuing through the 1920s, the surrounding area grew into the city's \\"Newspaper Row\\". Several newspaper headquarters were built on Park Row just west of Nassau Street, including the Potter Building, the Park Row Building, the New York Times Building, and the New York World Building. The New-York Tribune and other newspapers would be among the first to construct early skyscrapers for their headquarters. Meanwhile, printing was centered around Beekman Street, one block south of the Tribune Building. The Tribune was founded in 1841 by Horace Greeley. Before the Tribune Building's construction, the site at Spruce and Nassau Streets had housed two earlier buildings that were also occupied by the Tribune. The first such building was destroyed by fire in February 1845 and a new five-story brick structure was completed at the same location three months later. An annex on Spruce Street, measuring square, was built in 1857.  Planning and construction  Sketch of the original building prior to its expansion By the early 1870s, the Tribune had become nationally known, and Greeley was running in the 1872 United States presidential election as the Liberal Republican and Democratic parties' nominee. The five-story headquarters, by then known as the \\"Rookery\\", was then functionally outdated and too small for the Tribune operations. Concurrently with Greeley's presidential campaign, the Tribune was looking to build a new headquarters at its site. Greeley died less than a month after his election defeat in November 1872, but plans for the new building proceeded under Tribune chief editor Whitelaw Reid, who pushed for a spacious, fireproof headquarters. There is evidence that an architectural design competition might have been held for the building. Documentation exists of a rejected design by Josiah Cleaveland Cady, first published in 1874, which included several layers of round-arched arcades on the facade as well as a corner campanile. Reid ultimately selected Richard Morris Hunt as architect, and Hunt submitted plans for an eight-story building to the New York City Department of Buildings in June 1873. Property on Nassau and Frankfort Streets was taken for the new structure during early 1873. Demolition of the second Tribune building was accomplished in a two-week span in May 1873, and work on the foundation started in early June. The western portion of the new building facing Nassau Street was to be completed first, while the eastern portion on Spruce and Frankfort Streets would be built later, after the existing leases on the sites had expired. The cornerstone was laid on January 24, 1874. At some point after construction commenced, the building's height was raised from eight to ten stories so that, at , it would surpass the Western Union Telegraph Building. The New York Sun, which occupied a neighboring building at Nassau and Frankfort Streets, filed a lawsuit in early 1874 against the Tribune owner, stating that the Tribune Building's construction had encroached on the property on the Sun. In addition, a carpenter's son and an iron contractor were killed in separate incidents during the building's construction.  Completion and late 19th century  On April 10, 1875, the Tribune announced that it had started issuing from the new building. The initial section of the building only had frontage of along Nassau Street and on Spruce Street; the remainder of the Spruce Street frontage was occupied by the Tribune printing house at the time. The original floor layout with per floor, was small enough that all of the offices could be lit directly by the windows, and the thick masonry walls took up half the first floor area. At the beginning, the editorial rooms were on the eighth floor while the composing room was on the ninth floor. A Philadelphia newspaper stated, \\"There isn't an editor-in-chief in the city as well housed as the humblest reporter on The Tribune.\\" Work on an annex to the building, extending to Frankfort Street, started on July 12, 1881, and was completed in 1882. The Frankfort Street addition had been part of Hunt's original plans, though Raht was listed as the architect in charge. After the completion of the annex, the building measured along Spruce Street and along Frankfort Street, while the Nassau Street frontage remained unchanged. A statue of Horace Greeley by John Quincy Adams Ward was unveiled in front of one of the building's ground-floor windows in 1890. According to British magazine The Building News, the structure was originally considered \\"as a piece of folly\\" with no tenants \\"who would risk their lives in it\\", because of the relatively novel nature of the early skyscraper. However, the Real Estate Record and Guide stated in 1882 that the Tribune, Times, Morse, and Temple Court buildings were close to the courts of the Civic Center, making these buildings ideal for lawyers. By that February, the Real Estate Record had reported that many offices in the Tribune Building, and in the nearby Kelly, Mills, and Marquand Buildings had already been \\"engaged, and at very fair figures\\". This was part of a general increase in demand for space in Lower Manhattan. The Building News wrote in 1883 that the building had cost ¬£200,000 (about $25.85 million in 2020) excluding land costs, but that it was earning annual income of ¬£15,000 (about $1.93 million in 2020). This gave the building a return on investment of 6‚Äì7% a year, excluding the space occupied by the Tribune rent-free. The other floors contained commercial tenants including the Homer Lee Bank Note Company, a newspaper called The Morning Journal, and the offices of businessman and inventor Charles A. Cheever. A saloon took space in the cellar, a fact that the rival New York Times made fun of, given Greeley's opposition to drinking. The Tribune Building experienced several fires in its early history, although its fireproof construction limited the spread of the fire. The Tribune offices were extensively damaged in a fire in 1888, although there was little structural damage to the building. A subsequent fire in the cellar in 1890 caused damage only to two rooms in the basement. At the time, the Tribune reported that two fires had previously taken place there: the 1888 blaze and another fire in 1881. Another fire in the building in 1900 caused some water damage. Further expansion and early 20th century View of Newspaper Row in 1900, with the Tribune Building at center In August 1903, the Tribune Association announced that the building would be expanded from ten to nineteen stories, to designs by architects D'Oench & Yost and L. Thouyard. The original mansard would be removed to make way for the new stories; in conjunction with the project, the clock tower would be taken down and rebuilt atop the new building, and a 19-story annex would be built on Frankfort Street to match the additional floors. The Tribune would relocate to the first and second stories, and modifications would be made to the elevators and entrance. That October, the Tribune acquired the land on Frankfort Street, including a building housing the New York American. A general contract for the construction was given to D. C. Weeks & Son, who started work in May 1905. The work was completed by 1907. Pace University had its first classrooms in the building, renting out one room upon its establishment in 1906. The expanded building also housed the headquarters of the New York Public Service Commission, which moved to the building in 1907. The commission's main offices were on the 14th floor, and it also had a boiler room on the 3rd floor and an engineering department on the 19th floor and the attic. By 1914, the Tribune was looking to move its headquarters further uptown in Manhattan. At the same time, the New York Sun had announced its intention to leave the adjacent building at Nassau and Frankfort Streets, but the Tribune offer for the Sun building was denied. The Greeley statue in front of the building was moved to City Hall Park in 1916. The Tribune was looking to build a new headquarters by the early 1920s, buying two plots on 40th Street in Midtown Manhattan in December 1921. At that time, the Tribune had signed a contract to sell its Nassau Street building to S. M. Banner and H. E. Mitler, to take effect in May 1923. Retired merchant Victor Welchman, along with his partner Alvin S. Harte, leased the building for 21 years in 1922, at an aggregate net rental of $5 million. Among the other tenants in the building at the time were a writers' and artists' syndicate, paper stock corporations, attorneys, and advertisers. Before the sale of the building was to take effect, Welchman and Harte sued Banner and Mitler's company, the Akul Building Corporation, alleging that Akul had fraudulently misrepresented the building's worth. Akul thus refused to pay the balance of the purchase price to the Tribune, and the sale was canceled, with the paper continuing to hold the property. The Tribune itself moved uptown to 40th Street in April 1923.  Later use and demolition  Frank A. Munsey, the owner of the Sun, arranged to buy the Tribune Building in late 1925. After Munsey's death that year, the Frank A. Munsey Company completed the purchase in May 1926, with the intent of holding the property as an investment. The Munsey Company passed the building and several others on the same block to Museum Estates Inc., a company representing the Metropolitan Museum of Art, in 1928. Part of the first and second floor spaces were converted into a small movie theater in 1935. The work involved cutting away part of the second floor, and during the conversion, the building's seventeen upper floors were supported on hydraulic jacks until new trusses for the theater were installed. Another part of the basement, first floor, and second floor became a restaurant in 1936. Museum Estates Inc. sold the Tribune Building in 1942 to an investment syndicate who had also bought several other properties on the same block. Ownership passed to another syndicate called the 154 Nassau Corp. three years later, and by 1946, it was under the ownership of Borrock, Steingart & Borrock. By the 1950s, the building was known as the Nassau- Tribune Building, and it was sold in 1956 to an investment syndicate headed by Frederick W. Gehle. The syndicate planned to upgrade the building with amenities such as air conditioning. Two years later, William Greenberg and Robert Greene leased the building for 21 years for an aggregate rental price exceeding $9 million. The New York Tribune Building was demolished in 1966 to make way for 1 Pace Plaza. In May 1966, Pace University announced that it would demolish the New York Tribune Building to make way for 1 Pace Plaza, as part of a wide-ranging redevelopment of the surrounding area. The city moved to condemn the building in July 1966, and Pace took ownership of the site six months later. The Jay Demolition Company was hired to destroy the building. So much dust was created in the destruction process that the Department of Buildings issued the demolition contractor several summonses for pollution; these summonses were challenged by the city's Department of Real Estate, which claimed that the summonses were holding up the site's redevelopment. The Tribune Building site was a \\"block of rubble\\" by the time construction on 1 Pace Plaza commenced in December 1966. 1 Pace Plaza ultimately opened in 1970. Little remains of the Tribune Building's existence. When the Skyscraper Museum was unable to come up with enough artifacts for a 2012 skyscraper exhibition, Christopher Gray of The New York Times wrote that the building had \\"vanished almost without a trace, and barely a whimper\\".  Legacy  The building had largely negative reception upon its completion; according to architectural writers Sarah Landau and Carl W. Condit, \\"nobody has ever had much good to say about the architectural features of the building\\". The Bulletin of Norwich, Connecticut, referred to the structure as a \\"gorgeous groggery\\" and The New York Times likened the structure to a sugar refinery. Montgomery Schuyler, writing for the World, referred to the building as \\"a glaring collocation of red and white and black, which time can never mellow\\". Alfred J. Bloor, a contemporary of Hunt's, described the color contrast of the facade as \\"too violent\\" and the general form as \\"extravagant\\" because of the bend in the main Nassau Street elevation. The mansard roof of the original building was also seen as overly large compared to the other stories. The Real Estate Record and Guide wrote, \\"A beautiful example of [the mansard's] needless introduction is the new Tribune Building, where the roof is just this extra story too deep.\\" There were some positive reviews of the design. Bloor stated that, despite the contrast of the facade and the proportions, the Tribune Building was otherwise \\"one of the most graceful examples extant ‚Ä¶ by which Neo-Grec lines are infused with Gothic sentiment\\". Although the demolition of the Tribune Building was largely unremarked upon, the Brooklyn Museum's director at the time Thomas S. Buechner called the demolition \\"heartbreaking\\" and that the building had been \\"a sumptuous Victorian conglomerate in glorious Ruskinian color\\". Hunt's initial structure has been described as one of three influential early skyscrapers of Lower Manhattan, along with the Equitable Life Building and the Western Union Building. The Tribune and Western Union Buildings are variously cited as being either the first-ever skyscrapers, or the next major skyscrapers after the Equitable Life Building because of their substantial height increase. The critic Winston Weisman stated that the Tribune Building was intended as a pioneering skyscraper, saying, \\"The total effect of the design is not elegant. It is structural.\\" References  Notes   Citations   Sources   External links * Buildings and structures demolished in 1966 Civic Center, Manhattan Demolished buildings and structures in Manhattan Destroyed landmarks in New York City Financial District, Manhattan Former skyscrapers Newspaper headquarters in the United States Office buildings completed in 1875 Skyscraper office buildings in Manhattan ","title":"New York Tribune Building"},{"id":"34240584","title":"Eternal Law"},{"id":"34240586","text":"Ovachlamys is a genus of land snails in the family Helicarionidae.

He plays for the Down senior inter-county football team and with his local club, Bryansford. Kalum has played for the county for six seasons which began in 2004 where he played a key part in Down's promotion run in the national league that year and played for Down in 2005 as well. Following these initial two seasons Kalum took a break from the sport to concentrate on his studies at Queens University. He restarted his county career in 2010 under the management of James McCartan. The 2010 season proved to be a strong season for Kalum in that he started every game that year, gaining promotion from Division 2 and performing well during the championship run. The championship that year was somewhat of a fairytale for the team in that they progressed to the All-Ireland Final against all expectations. The 2010 Championship run began in Ballbofey against Donegal with an overtime win sealed by the classy Benny Coulter. The success of this was short lived when they played Tyrone in Casement Park a few weeks later. After a strong start Tyrone showed their class and closed the game out to put Down out of the Championship. Few gave Down much hope of progressing in the qualifiers. In Down's first match in the qualifiers they played Longford at Pairc Esler. In poor conditions Down prevailed with a 4-point victory over their opponents, with Kalum picking up 2 yellow cards for a sending-off during the game. The next game was against Offaly in Tullamore, where Kalum turned in a 'Man of the Match' performance to overturn a large first-half deficit to come away with the victory and move to the next round of the qualifiers. Sligo were the next opponents and saw Down pick up their biggest championship win in a number of years with a huge 3-20 to 0-10 win. This gave the side serious momentum for Kerry who lay in wait in the All-Ireland Quarter Finals. In July 2010 Down came against the mighty Kerry in Croke Park. Down took control of the game early with a fantastic goal from Mark Poland, and this set the tone for the game, with Down finishing convincing winners by the end of the game. Kildare were the opponents in the semi-final, and few gave Down much hope of going any further as they had already surpassed people's expectations. In August 2010 Down faced off against Kildare in the All-Ireland Semi-Final. After Kildare made a strong start to the game edging ahead of Down, a controversial Benny Coulter goal turned the game on its head and Down lead for the majority of the game, with both sides going point for point for the remainder of the game. Leading by 2 points, Down fouled a Kildare forward just outside the penalty box. Requiring a goal the Kildare forward struck a rasping shot for the top corner of Down's net. The goal line was packed with Down players to prevent a goal. The ball was palmed to the crossbar by Kalum's left hand and kicked away to safety, thus ending one of the games of the championship with a thrilling finale. Local media termed the save as the 'Hand of God'. In the third week of September Down played Cork in what was deemed a 'David vs. Goliath' contest in that Cork had played in numerous All-Ireland Finals over the previous years and many felt that it was their time to lift the Sam Maguire. After a cagey first half Down lead by 3 points. Going into the second half, Cork made a number of key personnel changes highlighting the strength and depth of their panel and ultimately edged out the game by 1 point to win and ultimately end Down's fairytale Championship Run. Kalum was recognised with his consistently strong performances in the championship by receiving an All-Star Nomination, as well as picking up the East Down player of the year within his own county. In following seasons he was appointed vice captain in 2012 and has been captain for various McKenna Cup and National League games highlighting his growing influence within the County. At club level, Kalum was part of the Bryansford Championship winning side in 2003 and he closed an 11-year gap with no silverware by being part of the side that won the League title in 2014 after a thrilling match vs. Mayobridge in Kilcoo. An all county U-21 title was picked up in 2003 as well. Outside of Gaelic success has followed with various underage boxing titles with the highlight being representing Ulster boxing team in South Africa in 2008.

It is a private corporation accredited by the American Alliance of Museums, encouraging art education in the community. Its permanent collection includes Texas artists. Background The first half of the 20th century saw Tyler, Texas and its surrounding area grow in population as the flower industry and the oil exploration industry boosted the local economy. Camp Fannin during World War II, and later manufacturing plants, also attributed to the local economy and its resulting population growth. A dedicated group of local citizens saw the need for an art museum to serve the expanding population. By 1952, no such museum existed within a radius of Tyler. In order to supplement art education in the local school system, the Community Arts Committee was formed by the Tyler Service League. For the next eight years, a group of volunteer League women who called themselves the Picture Ladies formed a type of mobile museum. They took pictures to classrooms on a weekly basis. From 1960 to 1965, the League's efforts took on a semi-permanence with the purchase of a local house to serve as the Tyler museum's first home. Proceeds from the 1965 sale of the house went towards what would become the structure that is today known as the Tyler Museum of Art. In 1969, the Tyler Service League changed its name and was chartered as the non-profit Tyler Junior League. Museum The architectural firm of E. Davis Wilcox and Associates designed the new two-story museum, which had its grand opening on April 1, 1971, on the east side of the Tyler Junior College. Three galleries are contained within the building, two galleries and a smaller gallery. Since 1971, the museum has acquired over 1,500 works for its permanent collection. Encouragement is given to local student artists through the museum's sponsorship of the annual high school art exhibition. Tours, workshops, lectures, films and talks are offered throughout the year. Past events include a Texas Writers' Series. Members of the public are encouraged to apply as Docents. The museum is accredited by the American Alliance of Museums. A board of trustees oversees the activities of the museum. Funding comes from public contributions and some local municipality assistance. The local school district financially supports the educational endeavors at the museum.

An Arab League monitoring mission ended in failure as Syrian troops and anti-government militants continued to do battle across the country and the Syrian government prevented foreign observers from touring active battlefields, including besieged opposition strongholds. A United Nations-backed ceasefire brokered by special envoy Kofi Annan met a similar fate, with unarmed UN peacekeepers' movements tightly controlled by the government and fighting. January 2012 1 January Multiple reports on Twitter claimed that Syrians in several restive neighborhoods and cities, including al-Midan in central Damascus, Baba Amr in Homs, and Idlib city, were marching in New Year's Day protests against the government in the early morning, shortly after midnight. The opposition Local Co-ordinating Committees announced it had confirmed 5,862 deaths in the Syrian uprising during 2011, including 287 prisoners allegedly tortured to death. The LCC also announced the first confirmed death from the uprising in 2012, a wounded person who died due to insufficient blood plasma supply at a hospital. That death toll rose to eight, several of them fatalities from Syrian security forces firing on protesters in the Damascene suburb of Daria, the LCC reported near the end of the day. Neoconservative commentator Nick Cohen, writing for the British newspaper The Guardian, said that the Western world should in intervene militarily to oust President Bashar al-Assad and stop the Syrian Army from committing further human rights violations. The editorial echoed opposition claims that interrogators in Aleppo had invented a new type of torture wherein detainees are forced to stand on a heated metal plate until they confess or else collapse from extensive damage to their feet. The Arab Parliament, a consultative pan-Arab body created by the Arab League, called for the withdrawal of the supranational organization's observers from Syria. Ali El- Salem El-Dekbas, the Speaker of the Parliament, said the observers were doing no good and it was a disgrace to keep them in Syria with the crackdown ongoing. \\"The mission of the Arab League team has missed its aim of stopping the killing of children and ensuring the withdrawal of troops from the Syrian streets, giving the Syrian regime a cover to commit inhumane acts under the noses of the Arab League observers,\\" Dekbas said in a statement. Assad insider and Syrian security officer Colonel Hafez Makhlouf's plans to visit Switzerland were waylaid when the Swiss Federal Tribunal ruled that Makhlouf should not be granted a visa. Makhlouf had reportedly planned to consult with an attorney in Switzerland on a bid to overturn international sanctions freezing his assets and restricting his travel. According to Iranian state news agency PressTV, a poll conducted by The Doha Debates showed that 55% of Syrian respondents did not want Assad to resign. 2 January Nabil Elaraby, secretary-general of the Arab League, defended the observer mission after the Arab Parliament's call for its withdrawal. Elaraby claimed that, as a result of the monitors' presence placing pressure on the Syrian government to comply with the Arab peace initiative, Syrian Army (SA) tanks had been withdrawn from cities, almost 3,500 detainees had been released, and humanitarian aid had been delivered to formerly besieged cities. However, contradicting mission leader General Mohammed Ahmed Mustafa al-Dabi's remarks on Newshour two days earlier, Elaraby acknowledged snipers remained in several areas and shooting was still ongoing, though it was hard for monitors to tell who was shooting and at whom. Opposition activists contested Elaraby's remarks, telling The Los Angeles Times that many tanks had not withdrawn and were being hidden within striking distance of city centers in restive areas. Meanwhile, Israeli Defence Minister Ehud Barak told the Knesset that he judged Assad's remaining time in power could be measured in weeks. The opposition Syrian Revolution General Commission (SRGC) said four were killed in Syria by security forces as of 9 am local time. The Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA), the state-run media outlet in Syria, said a school worker was killed by gunmen holding her hostage and a journalist died of wounds suffered in a shooting in Daraya, a Damascus suburb, some days earlier. In northern Syria's Idlib Governorate, near the border with Turkey, the opposition Syrian Observatory For Human Rights (SOHR) said that, despite a self-imposed moratorium on offensive actions against the regime during the Arab League mission, Free Syrian Army (FSA) fighters captured two military checkpoints and took several dozen soldiers prisoner, and clashed with security forces at a third, leaving an unspecified number of SA soldiers dead or wounded. The claim could not be immediately confirmed due to tight restrictions on foreign media in Syria. 3 January According to the SOHR, at least 18 people were killed in Jassem during clashes between SA soldiers after loyalist troops allegedly fired on comrades who were attempting to defect. Security forces swept through the area, detaining more than 100, after the fighting. Witnesses said several were killed when security forces fired live ammunition into demonstrators massing in Hama. According to SANA, a policeman was shot dead outside Homs National Hospital and another policeman was shot dead at al-Khudra market, Idlib. The Syrian government claimed \\"terrorists\\" destroyed a gas pipeline near Rastan, disrupting the electricity supply to parts of the country. FSA leader Colonel Riad al-Asaad said the FSA may mount \\"a huge escalation of our operations\\" in coming days. However, some analysts cast aspersions on the claim, suggesting Asaad may be more a figurehead than a practical leader. President Nicolas Sarkozy, the French head of state, accused Assad of committing \\"massacres\\" in Syria. His criticism was echoed by French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, who called on the Syrian government to allow the Arab League's monitors unrestricted access. In Cairo, the Arab League called an emergency meeting for 7 January to review the observer mission's work and discuss its future. 4 January Syrian Defence Ministry official Mahmoud Sleiman Hajj Hamad defected to the opposition, The Guardian and other major news outlets reported. Hamad was the Head Inspector of the Syrian Ministry of Defence. He also held a press conference on Wednesday in Cairo to announce his defection. In an interview with Al Jazeera, Hamad, who was also an inspector at the monetary center for the interior ministry, denied government claims that the ongoing violence was caused by \\"terrorists\\" aided from abroad. :\\"We were analysing and seeing for ourselves that the regime's story about armed gangs going out and killing protesters was all lies,\\" he said. \\"I confirm there are no armed gangs, they are all unarmed protesters\\". Hamad said the government has spent about $40m on loyalist militias to crush demonstrations since March, as security forces, at times backed by tanks, laid siege to protests hubs across the nation. :\\"While auditing, I found two billion Syrian pounds [$40m] paid out to the regime's paid thugs, and seen an increase in the spending of the intelligence and defense ministries for the purpose of paying thugs. We saw them preparing and heading out in their armored vehicles and buses toward the young protesters and killing them. It has been happening since the beginning of the protests\\". Hamad also said most government officials and employees want to defect but are afraid of the consequences. :\\"Syrian government officials live in a kind of prison...No one can go anywhere without being accompanied by a member of the security services,\\" he added. Hamad continued that he has seen proof that Iran and Iraq are aiding the Syrian government's crackdown. Hamad also praised the FSA. Meanwhile, the LCC reported at least five deaths and numerous injuries it described as \\"serious\\" as a result of security forces' actions. The SNC announced a new official website at syriancouncil.org. SANA reported that a gas pipeline and a bridge were bombed near al-Rastan. Mihajja Bridge in Daraa Countryside was also reportedly damaged by a bomb, which targeted a police patrol. The blast and gunfire that followed reportedly killed one policeman and wounded five. Meanwhile, a Baath Party worker was shot dead as he drove his car in Hama Countryside, SANA said. 5 January Qatari Prime Minister Hamad bin Jassim al-Thani criticized the Arab League mission in Syria, saying after a meeting with United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in New York City, \\"I said we must evaluate the types of mistakes it made and without a shadow of a doubt I see mistakes, even though we went in to observe, not to stop the violence.\\" He said he had suggested to Ban that the UN could take a role in training Arab League personnel in how to monitor human rights situations in the future. Despite Sheikh Hamad's remarks, Reuters reported citing sources within Arab governments that the Arab League was likely to decide over the weekend to keep the observers in Syria. Meanwhile, SNC President Burhan Ghalioun suggested a military intervention in Syria would not need to be NATO-led and could be done on a more limited scale than in the Libyan Civil War. Influential Iranian parliamentarian Alaeddin Boroujerdi took the opposite tack, accusing Turkey of threatening the \\"stability\\" of the region by criticizing the Syrian government and harboring the FSA and other political dissidents. Boroujerdi called for Ankara to modify its stance to be in line with Tehran's approach of rejecting all international criticism of Damascus' handling of the uprising. In Syria itself, the government reported it had released 552 detainees \\"whose hands were not stained with blood\\". Kurdish media reported the death of a young Kurdish man in Harasta and three injuries to Kurds in Qamishlo, all allegedly at the hands of loyalist snipers. The accounts could not be independently confirmed. According to SANA, a policeman and two bystanders were killed in a drive-by-shooting in Homs, while another two policemen were injured by an explosive device in al-Tarnabeh, Idlib province. Two rebels were allegedly killed when a bomb prematurely exploded in Idlib city industrial zone.

The attack allegedly targeted a police bus, leaving 25 people dead and 46 wounded. The Syrian government immediately called the attack a \\"continuation of the terrorist acts targeting innocent civilians\\" and said it \\"reflects the criminal mentality of perpetrators and their antagonism towards moral heritage and national values\\", while Colonel Asaad and the SNC both issued statements accusing the government of staging the attack to sully the opposition's image and deter a planned protest in the area, one of the hubs of the uprising. Later in the day, SANA reported that an explosion caused by \\"terrorists\\" had severed an oil pipeline between Hama and Idlib governorates. Meanwhile, according to Al Arabiya, an Arab League team of monitors withdrew from the Damascus suburb of Arbeen after loyalist forces shot at them as they toured the streets. CNN reported that the incident occurred when protesters surrounded the monitors, chanting slogans against the government, and security forces opened fire on them, endangering the observers. A Syrian opposition member claimed that he learned from anonymous security forces in Aleppo that the Syrian government was planning an orchestrated bombing in Aleppo. In Friday protests, activists said at least 35 were killed throughout Syria, including in the Kfar Souseh neighborhood of Damascus, according to a witness who said he saw security forces open fire on unarmed demonstrators. Major protests also took place in Aleppo, Idlib, Qamishli, Deir ez-Zor, Homs, and elsewhere in Damascus, among other parts of Syria. Three soldiers attempting to defect were shot dead in Rastan, according to the LCC.

Brigadier General Mustafa al- Sheikh of the SAA, who previously defected in December, publicly announced his defection on Al Jazeera on 6 January; the highest-ranking defector so far. 7 January Colonel Afeef Mahmoud Suleiman of the Syrian Air Force logistics division defected along with at least 50 of his men, ordering his men to protect protesters in the city of Hama. \\"We are from the Army and we have defected because the government is killing civilian protesters. The Syrian Army attacked Hama with heavy weapons, air raids and heavy fire from tanks...We ask the Arab League observers to come visit areas affected by air raids and attacks so you can see the damage with your own eyes, and we ask you to send someone to uncover the three cemeteries in Hama filled with more than 460 corpses,\\" Colonel Suleima said in a statement. In Damascus, thousands of pro-government protesters gathered at a mosque for the funeral of 11 policemen the government said died in the previous day's bombing. Opposition activists accused the government of making fake television footage of the aftermath of the bombing, pointing to three clips they said were \\"mistakenly\\" aired by Syrian state TV. One shows what seems to be an injured man on the ground standing up just before the end of the clip. Another shows a man with a microphone (allegedly a reporter for Syrian state TV) placing \\"bags of vegetables\\" in the street to give the impression that some of the victims were civilians shopping in the nearby market. The third video shows a person putting police shields in one of the damaged vans. 8 January More than a dozen people, including 11 soldiers, were killed in clashes between rebels and loyalists in Basr al-Harir, a town in southern Daraa Governorate, according to the SOHR.

He claimed that victory was near if Syrians had \\"courage\\". He blamed what he called \\"foreign conspiracies\\" for the unrest in Syria and said that restoring order can only be done by fighting \\"terrorists\\" with an iron fist. He denied that he gave orders to shoot protesters.

Anwar Malek, an Algerian Arab League observer who was part of the monitoring team, told Al Jazeera that he resigned because of what he saw, and said that the mission was falling apart. \\"What I saw was a humanitarian disaster. The regime is not just committing one war crime, but a series of crimes against its people,\\" he said. \\"The snipers are everywhere shooting at civilians. People are being kidnapped. Prisoners are being tortured and none were released\\". He said that security forces did not withdraw their tanks from the streets, but just hid them and then redeployed them after the observers left. Malek also said \\"The regime didn't meet any of our requests, in fact they were trying to deceive us and steer us away from what was really happening, towards insignificant things\\". He said that those who were supposedly freed and were shown on TV, were actually people who had been randomly grabbed off the street. \\"They were detained for four or five days in tough conditions and later released as if they had been real prisoners\\". Malek also said that he had seen snipers on top of buildings: \\"On one, there were even army officers in front of the building, while snipers were on the roof. Some on our team preferred to maintain good relations with the regime and denied that there were snipers\\". He said that Assad's government \\"has gained a lot of time that has helped it implement its plan. Therefore I've decided to withdraw from this mission\\". The head of the Arab League observer mission, Sudanese Lieutenant-General Mohammed Al Dabi, distanced himself from Malek's claims, saying that Malek did not leave his hotel room because of illness. This was later denied by Malek, who said that he is shown on many videos taken by activists, as well as Syrian state TV coverage that showed him walking the streets of Homs. He also accused Dabi of ignoring his requests to talk to him about his reasons for resigning. The Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations, Lynn Pascoe, said that, since the Arab League mission began, an estimated 400 people have been killed, an average of 40 a day, a rate much higher than before the mission began.

Since 23 January, both Hama and Homs have been under intensive siege and occupation by the Syrian army, which wishes to take back neighborhoods in Hama and Homs recently controlled by the Free Syrian Army. Over the past week intensive clashes between the Free Syrian Army and the government's forces lead to the FSA's takeover of large proportions of Homs, Hama, and suburban Damascus, prompting retaliatory attacks by the Syrian army, which additionally lead to dozens of civilian casualties. the majority of Friday's casualties were in Homs. Gen. Mustafa al-Dabi warned of an escalation of the conflict in recent days.

It is a Grade I listed building. History The nave interior, looking east After the Norman conquest monks from the Abbey of Saint Nicolas in Angers, in France, were sent to take control of Spalding Priory. In 1284 Prior William of Littleport laid the foundations for a new parish church to replace the earlier parish church which was situated on the Priory boundary, on the site of the Sheep Market. The record states that the new church was to be built ‚Äúon the other side of the water towards the east, in the great cemetery where was formerly a certain chapel which was called the Chapel of the blessed Thomas the Martyr‚Äù. The church was completed after the death of Prior William by his successor Clement of Hatfield (1293-1318) The building was cruciform. It consisted of an aisled nave with six bays, aisled transepts of two bays, a chancel without an aisle and a bell tower. In 1360, the west aisle of the south transept and the south aisle of the nave were widened, and the outer south aisle added. Also, at this time, the south porch and the tower were built. In the middle of fifteenth century the chancel screen and a rood were added, reached by a spiral staircase. The pillars were heightened by six feet and the clerestory windows were added. The great west window was built in the Perpendicular style and a hammerbeam roof with angels was constructed. High box pews with galleries above them and a three-decker pulpit were installed during the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, giving the church a very different appearance from today. These features were removed during the extensive restoration in 1865-67, under the direction of Sir George Gilbert Scott. The rood screen was reconstructed by John Oldrid Scott in 1875 and incorporates parts of the fifteenth-century screen. The twentieth-century additions included four modern stained glass windows, the decoration of the chancel ceiling by Stephen Dykes Bower, rebuilding and re-siting the organ, the shop and visitor centre, and a vestry on the south side of the chancel. In 2013 the main entrance was relocated to the west door and an internal glazed porch was fitted. At the same time, a new stone floor was laid and the steps were removed from the font. In 2017 a servery was installed at the west end of the nave. The stipend for the Vicar of Spalding is paid by the Spalding Rectory Feoffees, a charity established on 1 March 1620.

Coal balls were formed in Carboniferous Period swamps and mires, when peat was prevented from being turned into coal by the high amount of calcite surrounding the peat; the calcite caused it to be turned into stone instead. As such, despite not actually being made of coal, the coal ball owes its name to its similar origins as well as its similar shape with actual coal. Coal balls often preserve a remarkable record of the microscopic tissue structure of Carboniferous swamp and mire plants, which would otherwise have been completely destroyed. Their unique preservation of Carboniferous plants makes them valuable to scientists, who cut and peel the coal balls to research the geological past. In 1855, two English scientists, Joseph Dalton Hooker and Edward William Binney, made the first scientific description of coal balls in England, and the initial research on coal balls was carried out in Europe. North American coal balls were discovered and identified in 1922. Coal balls have since been found in other countries, leading to the discovery of hundreds of species and genera. Coal balls may be found in coal seams across North America and Eurasia. North American coal balls are more widespread, both stratigraphically and geologically, than those in Europe. The oldest known coal balls date from the Namurian stage of the Carboniferous; they were found in Germany and on the territory of former Czechoslovakia. Introduction to the scientific world, and formation Sir Joseph Dalton Hooker, who along with Edward William Binney was the first to report on coal balls The first scientific description of coal balls was made in 1855 by Sir Joseph Dalton Hooker and Edward William Binney, who reported on examples in the coal seams of Yorkshire and Lancashire, England. European scientists did much of the early research. Coal balls in North America were first found in Iowa coal seams in 1894, although the connection to European coal balls was not made until Adolf Carl No√© (whose coal ball was found by Gilbert Cady) drew the parallel in 1922. No√©'s work renewed interest in coal balls, and by the 1930s had drawn paleobotanists from Europe to the Illinois Basin in search of them. There are two theories ‚Äì the autochthonous (in situ) theory and the allochthonous (drift) theory ‚Äì that attempt to explain the formation of coal balls, although the subject is mostly speculation. Supporters of the in situ theory believe that close to its present location organic matter accumulated near a peat bog and, shortly after burial, underwent permineralisation ‚Äì minerals seeped into the organic matter and formed an internal cast. Water with a high dissolved mineral content was buried with the plant matter in a peat bog. As the dissolved ions crystallised, the mineral matter precipitated out. This caused concretions containing plant material to form and preserve as rounded lumps of stone. Coalification was thus prevented, and the peat was preserved and eventually became a coal ball. The majority of coal balls are found in bituminous and anthracite coal seams, in locations where the peat was not compressed sufficiently to render the material into coal. Marie Stopes and David Watson analysed coal ball samples and decided that coal balls formed in situ. They stressed the importance of interaction with seawater, believing that it was necessary for the formation of coal balls. Some supporters of the in situ theory believe that Stopes' and Watson's discovery of a plant stem extending through multiple coal balls shows that coal balls formed in situ, stating that the drift theory fails to explain Stopes' and Watson's observation. They also cite fragile pieces of organic material projecting outside some coal balls, contending that if the drift theory was correct, the projections would have been destroyed, and some large coal balls are large enough that they could never have been able to be transported in the first place. The drift theory holds that the organic material did not form in or near its present location. Rather, it asserts that the material that would become a coal ball was transported from another location by means of a flood or a storm. Some supporters of the drift theory, such as Sergius Mamay and Ellis Yochelson, believed that the presence of marine animals in coal balls proved material was transported from a marine to a non-marine environment. Edward C. Jeffrey, stating that the in situ theory had \\"no good evidence\\", believed that the formation of coal balls from transported material was likely because coal balls often included material formed by transport and sedimentation in open water. Contents dolomite (top and bottom) are common materials found in coal balls. Coal balls are not made of coal; they are non-flammable and useless for fuel. Coal balls are calcium-rich permineralised life forms, mostly containing calcium and magnesium carbonates, pyrite, and quartz. Other minerals, including gypsum, illite, kaolinite, and lepidocrocite also appear in coal balls, albeit in lesser quantities. Although coal balls are usually about the size of a man's fist, their sizes vary greatly, ranging from that of a walnut up to in diameter. Coal balls have been found that were smaller than a thimble. Coal balls commonly contain dolomites, aragonite, and masses of organic matter at various stages of decomposition. Hooker and Binney analysed a coal ball and found \\"a lack of coniferous wood ... and fronds of ferns\\" and noted that the discovered plant matter \\"appear[ed] to [have been arranged] just as they fell from the plants that produced them\\". Coal balls usually do not preserve the leaves of plants. In 1962, Sergius Mamay and Ellis Yochelson analysed North American coal balls. Their discovery of marine organisms led to classification of coal balls were sorted into three types: normal (sometimes known as floral), containing only plant matter; faunal, containing animal fossils only; and mixed, containing both plant and animal material. Mixed coal balls are further divided into heterogeneous, where the plant and animal material was distinctly separated; and homogeneous, lacking that separation. Preservation The quality of preservation in coal balls varies from no preservation to the point of being able to analyse the cellular structures. Some coal balls contain preserved root hairs, pollen, and spores, and are described as being \\"more or less perfectly preserved\\", containing \\"not what used to be the plant\\", but rather, the plant itself. Others have been found to be \\"botanically worthless\\", with the organic matter having deteriorated before becoming a coal ball. Coal balls with well-preserved contents are useful to paleobotanists. They have been used to analyse the geographical distribution of vegetation: for example, providing evidence that Ukrainian and Oklahoman plants of the tropical belt were once the same. Research on coal balls has also led to the discovery of more than 130 genera and 350 species. Three main factors determine the quality of preserved material in a coal ball: the mineral constituents, the speed of the burial process, and the degree of compression before undergoing permineralisation. Generally, coal balls resulting from remains that have a quick burial with little decay and pressure are better preserved, although plant remains in most coal balls almost always show differing signs of decay and collapse. Coal balls containing quantities of iron sulfide have far lower preservation than coal balls permineralised by magnesium or calcium carbonate, which has earned iron sulfide the title \\"chief curse of the coal ball hunter\\". Distribution A coal ball from southern Illinois Coal balls were first found in England, and later in other parts of the world, including Australia, Belgium, the Netherlands, the former Czechoslovakia, Germany, Ukraine, China, and Spain. They were also encountered in North America, where they are geographically widespread compared to Europe; in the United States, coal balls have been found from Kansas to the Illinois Basin to the Appalachian region. The oldest coal balls were from the early end of the Namurian stage (326 to 313 mya) and discovered in Germany and former Czechoslovakia, but their ages generally range from the Permian (299 to 251 mya) to the Upper Carboniferous. Some coal balls from the US vary in age from the later end of the Westphalian (roughly 313 to 304 mya) to the later Stephanian (roughly 304 to 299 mya). European coal balls are generally from the early end of the Westphalian Stage. In coal seams, coal balls are completely surrounded by coal. They are often found randomly scattered throughout the seam in isolated groups, usually in the upper half of the seam. Their occurrence in coal seams can be either extremely sporadic or regular; many coal seams have been found to contain no coal balls, while others have been found to contain so many coal balls that miners avoid the area entirely. Analytical methods A thin section of a plant stem depicting calcite crystals. Thin sectioning was an early procedure used to analyse fossilised material contained in coal balls. The process required cutting a coal ball with a diamond saw, then flattening and polishing the thin section with an abrasive. It would be glued to a slide and placed under a petrographic microscope for examination. Although the process could be done with a machine, the large amount of time needed and the poor quality of samples produced by thin sectioning gave way to a more convenient method. The thin section technique was superseded by the now-common liquid-peel technique in 1928. In this technique, peels are obtained by cutting the surface of a coal ball with a diamond saw, grinding the cut surface on a glass plate with silicon carbide to a smooth finish, and etching the cut and the surface with hydrochloric acid. The acid dissolves the mineral matter from the coal ball, leaving a projecting layer of plant cells. After applying acetone, a piece of cellulose acetate is placed on the coal ball. This embeds the cells preserved in the coal ball into the cellulose acetate. Upon drying, the cellulose acetate can be removed from the coal ball with a razor and the obtained peel can be stained with a low-acidity stain and observed under a microscope. Up to 50 peels can be extracted from of coal ball with this method. However, the peels will degrade over time if they contain any iron sulfide (pyrite or marcasite). Shya Chitaley addressed this problem by revising the liquid-peel technique to separate the organic material preserved by the coal ball from the inorganic minerals, including iron sulfide. This allows the peel to retain its quality for a longer time. Chitaley's revisions begin after grinding the surface of the coal ball to a smooth finish. Her process essentially entails heating and then making multiple applications of solutions of paraffin in xylene to the coal ball. Each subsequent application has a greater concentration of paraffin in xylene to allow the wax to completely pervade the coal ball. Nitric acid, and then acetone, are applied to the coal ball. Following that, the process merges back into the liquid peel technique. X-ray powder diffraction has also been used to analyse coal balls. The X-rays of a predetermined wavelength are sent through a sample to examine its structure. This reveals information about the crystallographic structure, chemical composition, and physical properties of the examined material. The scattered intensity of the X-ray pattern is observed and analysed, with the measurements consisting of incident and scattered angle, polarisation, and wavelength or energy.

He is currently a member of Knesset for Derekh Eretz. He was originally elected as a member of the Blue and White alliance in 2019, before leaving to form Derekh Eretz in March 2020. A military historian by training, Hendel previously worked as a journalist, was the chairman of the Institute for Zionist Strategies (IZS), and taught academic courses at Bar-Ilan University. Between 2011 and 2012 he served as Director of Communications and Public Diplomacy for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.  Early life  Yoaz Hendel was born to a father of Romanian-Jewish descent and a mother of Romanian and Polish-Jewish descent in Petah Tikva and grew up in the religious settlement of Elkana. At age 18 he joined the Israel Defense Forces, serving in the elite Shayetet 13 naval commando unit as a combat officer. Hendel was discharged from the IDF after six years of service, and remained active for several additional years in the Israeli security system and Prime Minister‚Äôs Office. During his time in the IDF, Hendel fought in the 2006 Lebanon War and the 2008/09 Gaza War (also known as Operation Cast Lead). He holds the rank of a Lieutenant Colonel in the Reserves where he serves each year.  Career  Academia  Hendel studied history at Tel Aviv University where he achieved his PhD. His thesis was entitled Intelligence techniques in the Ancient World: From the Hasmonean Revolt to the Bar Kochba Revolt. He was a research fellow at the Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies at Tel Aviv University, and then at the Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies at Bar Ilan University. Over the years Hendel published several studies focusing on Israeli intelligence, the Second Lebanon War and guerrilla warfare tactics. From 2009 to 2013 Hendel lectured on terrorism and guerrilla warfare at Bar-Ilan University's Political Science Department.  Journalism  Over the years Hendel has written for numerous Israeli outlets. He had a weekly column at Yeditoh Ahronoth, Israel's largest daily newspaper and was a military and analyst for theMakor Rishon weekly paper, as well as appearing as a guest columnist in the Maariv daily. Hendel hosted a number of radio talk shows, including the weekly Retzu'at HaBitachon (Hebrew: ◊®◊¶◊ï◊¢◊™ ◊î◊ë◊ô◊ò◊ó◊ï◊ü, or military strip) corner on Israel's Army Radio (also known as Galei Tzahal), and an afternoon show with his political counterpart, Nitzan Horowitz. Hendel at Army Radio station, 2016 Yaron Deckel, Idan Raichel, Miri Regev, Yoaz Hendel, Dr. Asael Lubotzky During 2015 Hendel co-hosted the Friday morning talk show on Israel's Channel 10 TV.  Books and writings  In 2010 Hendel, together with Zaki Shalom, a professor at Ben Gurion University, authored \\"Let the IDF Win\\": The Self- Fulfilling Slogan on the Al Aqsa Intifada and the struggle against terrorist organizations. The book won the first prize in the Moldovan Award for Original Military Literature in that year. In 2011 Hendel published Daddy goes to reserve duty, a children's book about a girl whose father goes often to reserve service in the IDF. Hendel, a constant reserve serviceman, originally wrote the book for his children due to his absence from home while serving in the army. In March 2012, Israel vs. Iran: War of Shadows, co-authored by Hendel with Jerusalem Post military correspondent Yaakov Katz, was published in Hebrew; the English translation was published a year later. The book evaluates the threat to Israel‚Äôs security posed by a nuclear Iran since the Second Lebanon War of 2006, and analyzes Israel‚Äôs military and diplomatic options as well as intelligence analysis, future military measures, the Israeli Air Force attack in Syria, Operation Cast Lead, technological advances, cyberspace battles, assassinations and warfare smuggling by sea. The authors argue that Israel's war against Lebanon in 2006 and Operation Cast Lead against the Gaza Strip in 2008/09 were surrogate wars against Iran. In December 2015 Hendel published his fourth book \\"In an Unsown Land ‚Äì an Israeli Journey\\", providing a first-person account of the tribal code in the Israeli society, and its political and security challenges. The book was described as a right-wing, modern version of Amos Oz‚Äôs \\"In the Land of Israel\\". In September 2018 Hendel published a book titled Frank Conversations about Israeli Hope, in which he transcribed a series of one-on-one discussions he held with President Reuven Rivlin about the challenges facing Israel.  The Institute for Zionist Strategies  In May 2012 Hendel was appointed head of the Institute for Zionist Strategies (IZS). He remained in this position until his election to the Knesset in April 2019. Hendel also served as an executive member of Hashomer Hachadash, which engages in the protection of agricultural lands, was a member of Beit Hillel Rabbis, Natal (Hebrew: ◊†◊ò◊ú, the national organization for Trauma victims), and the board of governors of Bishvil Hamachar, as well as being active in other organizations. Public office  In August 2011 Hendel was appointed Director of Communications and Public Diplomacy for Prime Minister Netanyahu and in early 2012 as a member of the negotiation team with the Palestinians in Jordan. He resigned from his post on 21 February 2012, after Netanyahu told him he had lost confidence in him for having informed the Attorney General Yehuda Weinstein of possible sexual harassment by the Prime Minister's bureau chief Natan Eshel. This information eventually led to an investigation by the Civil Service Commission and Eshel's resignation. Hendel and Cabinet Secretary Zvi Hauser, who was also reprimanded by Netanyahu for the same reason, told Netanyahu that they had not updated him in order to not implicate him in the affair. In October 2012 the Movement for Quality Government in Israel awarded Hendel the title of \\"Knight of Quality Government 2012\\" in the Maintenance of Government Quality and Integrity Category for revealing the scandal. A year later he received the social prize of excellence by Ometz. Hendel's name was mentioned as a potential candidate during the 2013 and 2015 national elections, but he denied the offers claiming that he ‚Äúwanted to make a difference from the outside.‚Äù In February 2019 he officially joined the Blue and White slate ahead of Israel's April 2019 parliamentary elections.  Positions and opinions  Hendel is a self- described liberal nationalist with a right-wing pragmatic approach. He is generally considered to be on the center-right of the Blue and White alliance. In March 2013 the IZS, with Hendel as chairman, announced the establishment of a human rights organization called The Blue and White Human Rights Association. Hendel argues in his columns that the real right to the Land of Israel is accompanied by a moral debt. During the establishment conference, it was argued that Zionism is not a monopoly of the right, and human rights are not a monopoly of the left. The organization intends to operate at the crossings checkpoints where the IDF is present, to assist at points of friction, in schools to educate on the importance of purity of arms and with the help of a group of physicians, to provide free medical treatment regardless of religion, race or sex. Unlike other human rights organizations operating in the territories, the policy is not to provide information to the media about human rights violations, but to give the information to the army's authorized investigations. The human rights organization by Hendel deals with public relations on behalf of Israel, and presents the \\"efforts and the great moral advantage\\" of the Zionist movement. At the 2013 Herzliya Conference, Hendel claimed that he supports maximum separation from the Palestinians, but does not see any possibility of fulfilling a peace agreement in this generation. Hendel suggested annexing the settlement bloc and Jordan Valley, giving citizenship to the Arabs living there and, in return, increasing the Palestinian Authority areas from A to B, to create a continuous Palestinian zone and upgrade their political status, calling his proposal \\"maximizing the Israeli consensus and minimizing the boundaries of dispute\\". In an interview to Sarah Haetzni-Cohen, Hendel said that there is no \\"ultimate solution to the dispute\\", and suggested a quasi-\\"limited Allon project\\". In February 2020, Hendel said in an interview: \\"I believe Arab culture is the jungle. There you find gross violations of every human right that we recognize in the West. They haven't reached the stage of evolution in which there are human rights.\\" Gideon Levy: This Kahol Lavan Lawmaker Shows His True, Nationalist, Racist Colors. Haaretz, 12 March 2020.

In 2019 they moved their headquarters to a village outside of Madison, Wisconsin named Cottage Grove, Wisconsin. , it has 44 locations throughout the state. Summit has more than 206,000 members and $4.3 billion in assets, making it one of the largest credit unions in the state. Summit Credit Union is regulated by the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) as a federally insured state-chartered credit union. It was officially chartered in 1935 and was assigned NCUA charter number 67190. History Kim Sponem, CEO & President of Summit Credit Union, has been a credit union CEO for more than 18 years, including the top job when Summit was named Great Wisconsin Credit Union and, originally, CUNA Credit Union. CUNA, Inc. founded CUNA Credit Union, known today as Summit Credit Union, on September 17, 1935 in Madison, Wisconsin to serve the credit union movement and anyone else who was in need of credit union services. This unique charter was granted by the Wisconsin bank commissioner in 1935. The first location was in its sponsor company, in the Filene House. Credit union movement pioneers and organizers Thomas Doig and Roy Bergengren were early advocates for the formation of CUNA Credit Union to ensure all people everywhere had access to credit union membership. Back then, employees of a credit union could not borrow from their credit union. The credit union was there to ensure that employees could still receive their product needs from a credit union and that state leagues across the country had access to a credit union for their banking needs. Shortly after establishing this credit union, CUNA Mutual was formed to provide insurances and other services to credit unions and became one of its sponsor groups in addition to CUNA, Inc. The credit union expanded to other credit union entities as they were created, including World Council of Credit Unions (WOCCU), Credit Union Executive Society (CUES) and Filene and expanded to serve anyone, anywhere. In 2005, CUNA Credit Union changed its name to Great Wisconsin Credit Union (GWCU) and then, in 2008, changed its name to Summit Credit Union, merging in the former Summit Credit Union, formerly State Capitol Employees Credit Union, maintaining CUNA/Great Wisconsin‚Äôs original charter and field of membership.

The organization that would become the Fourth Missouri was largely composed of ethnic Germans, who were generally opposed to slavery and strongly supportive of the Unionist cause. Although initially without any official standing, beginning on April 22, 1861, four militia regiments Blair helped organize were sworn into Federal service at the St. Louis Arsenal by Captain John Schofield acting on the authority of President Lincoln. Secessionists and opponents of Unionist military organizing in Missouri in 1861 commonly referred to this unit as the \\"Black Guard\\" and \\"the blaggards\\".The official designation of the first four regiments organized at the St. Louis Arsenal were the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Missouri Volunteers (3 Months Service). The 4th Missouri Volunteer Infantry evolved out of a pre-existing German hunting society \\"Die Schwarzen J√§ger\\". Upon entry into Federal service, the members of the new Fourth Missouri elected Nicolaus Schuettner colonel of the regiment.Rombaur, Robert Julius, The Union Cause in St. Louis in 1861, St. Louis, St. Louis Municipal Centennial Year, 1909, p394 The new Missouri Volunteer regiments, subsequently elected (then) Captain Nathaniel Lyon as the brigadier general of the new brigade of Missouri volunteers. President Lincoln would later confirm Lyon's promotion from Captain to Brigadier general.  Military service  On May 10, 1861, the 1st Missouri under Colonel Blair participated in the arrest of the Missouri Volunteer Militia drilling at Camp Jackson at Lindell Grove on the western border of St. Louis City. As the Missouri militiamen were being marched under guard back to the Arsenal near the riverfront, angry crowds confronted the Federal forces, and the confused situation soon devolved into rioting and gunfire. Over 27 people were killed and the Camp Jackson Affair helped to polarize the state and send Missouri down the road to its own internal civil war. On May 21, 1861, Western Department commander Brigadier General William S. Harney ordered the Fourth Missouri to Bird's Point, Missouri, to fortify that strategic point on the Mississippi River. After that, the regiment moved to Cairo, Illinois, directly across the Mississippi River from Bird's Point, and the site of Fort Defiance, which guarded the junction of the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers. The regiment subsequently returned to St. Louis and carried out an expedition to Fulton, Missouri, while two of its companies carried out guard duty along Pacific Railroad. The regiment was mustered out on July 30, 1861. While many of the members of the regiment subsequently enlisted in 3-Year regiments, the original 4th Missouri was not continued as a 3-Year regiment. It does not share lineage with the 4th Missouri Volunteer Infantry (3 Years Service) created by the consolidation of the Gasconade Battalion and 3rd Regiment United States Reserve Corps in January 1862.

Looney Tunes cartoon, directed by Jack King. The short was released on June 6, 1935, and stars Buddy, the second star of the series. Summary Young bug-catcher Buddy merrily chases an insect with a net, eventually leading it into his \\"Bug House,\\" a backyard shack in which he collects and studies bugs. Buddy then removes a happy spider from its web and etherizes it upon a table, so that he might examine it with his microscope. As the spider cries, Buddy dispenses more ether. The ether, running off, sends Our Hero spiraling off to unconsciousness. Buddy starts dreaming. The spider breaks free of the microscope, and laughs to see its captor straddled about the floor, helpless. The spider leaps to a table on which a jar containing several other spiders is kept, and frees its fellows. One spider proceeds to free a frog trapped in a bottle; almost no time having past, several spiders already have a wakeful Buddy suspended beneath a web. The freed frog directs the contents of a box of \\"Reducing Pills\\" into a glass of water, then sucks up the water with a straw, and spits it into the struggling Buddy's mouth, by way of a funnel there placed. Our Hero shrinks almost instantly to the size of one of his captives. The creatures laugh, applaud in derision, point at their captive and sing of their victory. A hornet leads Buddy to the place of his trial: a repurposed radio. By way of some flypaper and alphabet soup letters, the insects announce: \\"Hear Ye! Hear Ye! Buddy will be tried in court for cruelty to insects!\\" All are commanded to be silent for the approach of the judge, a bee that emerges from a cuckoo clock, who swears all to the truth. The first witness approaches: Buddy, he claims, yanked off his leg. The next is a female butterfly, an orphan child, who reportedly had her parents taken from her by Buddy, and she was left to die. Another female insect was widowed by the defenseless plaintiff. Through all this, the judge continues to smack Buddy's head with his gavel. Following the testimony of the witnesses, the jury finds Buddy guilty as charged. As punishment for his crimes, they set the flame of a cigar lighter to Buddy's behind. Our Hero screams for help, and awakens from his dream to find a magnifying glass reflecting sunlight onto his backside, setting his trousers aflame. Buddy dashes over to a tub of water, in which he sits to the relief of the problem. Then, onto business he goes. He opens all the cages, sets all of his prisoners free, and shuts the door of Buddy's Bug House. The shut down is indeed forever, for the entire structure crumbles around him as he does so.

Returning to England he was Vicar of Horspath from 1938 until his death on 22 September 1944. Several schools in India are named after Moore.  Early life  Edward Alfred Livingstone Moore was the eldest son of Dr Edward Moore, the Principal of St Edmund Hall, Oxford. He was born in England in 1870. Bishop Moore received his MA from the University of Oxford, and shortly after became a Missionary of the Church Missionary Society in India.  Career When he was 32 years old, he became the Principal of the CMS College, Kottayam. After a few years at Kottayam, he left the principal position. For the following 8 years, he was a Missionary in Tamil Nadu ‚Äî he learned to speak Tamil and Malayalam. On 24 February 1925, he was consecrated a bishop by Randall Davidson, Archbishop of Canterbury, at Lambeth Palace Chapel, to serve as the fourth Bishop of Travancore & Cochin; he took charge of the Diocese at Kottayam in the same year. He was determined to end the caste system that was prevalent everywhere. He created history by ordaining two clergymen from the \\"backward classes\\". He established many community schools in different parts of the Diocese. The community school at Ranny was established as early as 1928 where the inmates trained in self-employment schemes. Although he was a Missionary Bishop, when the poor approached him en masse to convert to Christianity to escape discrimination, he discouraged them. He was of the opinion that a person should be converted to Christian faith only from conviction. Mahatma Gandhi personally congratulated him for not allowing mass conversion. At a time when medical facilities were not available to poor people in the coastal area, he introduced \\"mobile dispensaries\\" on boats so that medical help could be taken to the poor. The concept of \\"ecumenism\\" among the Christian churches in Kerala traces to the common retreats and Eucharist arranged by him in 1932 for the Priests of both CMS (after Independence C.S.I) and Marthoma Churches. Bishop Moore served the Diocese without salary or remuneration. Throughout his time in Kerala, he subsisted on help from his sister in England. He deposited the salary due to him into a special fund to support future Bishops. He retired from service in 1937 and returned to England. Moore died on 22 September 1944.

The film stars Natsuki Kato, Yuma Ishigaki and Yasuaki Kurata. It involves two detectives who hunt down a serial killer. The film was shown at the Tokyo International Film Festival in 2011. Production Producer and star of the film Yasuaki Kurata wanted to make a film with a female protagonist which led to an idea about making a vampire film. Kurata hired director Takanori Tsujimoto as it was his first horror film he worked on and Tsujimoto was known for his horror films. Kurata gave Tsujimoto the elements he wanted in the film (vampires, female protagonists and opportunities for extended action fight scenes) and had him build a story around them. Screenwriter Eiichi Yonekawa wrote a script involving two police detectives in Tokywo who are trying to catch the serial killer. Using it as a framework, Tsujimoto added large elements that would involve fake blood. The action scenes in the film were inspired by Hong Kong action cinema. Kurata compared the Hong Kong style to the Japanese style by saying that ‚ÄúHong Kong films are about over-action, or overdoing it; whereas Japanese action is often too subtle. It doesn‚Äôt satisfy the audience in the same way. I prefer Hong Kong style myself, but keep in mind that wire work was not used in Hong Kong until ‚ÄòChinese Ghost Story‚Äô (1987).

He was one of the first brewers to introduce modern bottom fermentation methods in Austria-Hungary (in Schwechat) and Poland (in Brzesko). Early life Johann Evangelist G√∂tz was born to Anton and Josephine G√∂tz. He attended the village school in his native Langenenslingen and middle school in Wilfigen, which he completed in 1830. He then worked in his father's brewery and on the family's farm. At the age of 18, as a journeyman brewer, he was employed in his cousin's brewery in Hitzhofen. Subsequently, as a member of the brewer's guild, he was obliged to travel away from his home region and establish himself as a brewer elsewhere. He left Bavaria in 1834 and traveled around Germany and Austria, working in various breweries. He finally settled in Klein-Schwechat, near Vienna, where he obtained a position of \\"Cellarer\\" in a brewery of another cousin, Anton. After a year and a half, he was promoted. As an assistant to his cousin over the course of six years, he improved and modernized the brewery so that eventually it became one of the best-run brewing enterprises in Austria-Hungary. It was during that time that G√∂tz introduced the then-new technique of bottom fermentation, which he would later utilize in his Okocim Brewery in Poland. Okocim Brewery Early in 1845, G√∂tz responded to an advertisement in the Viennese press of a local merchant, Joseph Neumann, and a Polish landowner, Julian Kodrƒôbski, who were looking for a partner in a brewing enterprise to be set up in Brzesko (then part of the Austrian partition of Poland).

Per a 1941 Associated Press article, CC41 meant \\"Controlled Commodity\\",\\"Underwear Streamlined,\\" Sept. 1941 Associated Press newspaper article and designated that the item met the government's austerity regulations. The CC41 logo was designed by Reginald Shipp. Historical background The need to ration certain commodities in time of war had affected manufacturers in Britain during the First World War. In 1917 the government introduced 'standard clothing' which were suits for men and boys and women's and girls dresses and accessories (hosiery and underwear) made to a standard pattern from 'standard cloth'. All items had a fixed price. This range of clothing first appeared in the summer of 1918 but manufacturers complained they could not make a profit on the items, and the public complained of poor quality. With the war coming to a close in November 1918, the scheme was dropped as more imports again reached Britain. Second World War IncSoc gown by Bianca Mosca was photographed by the Ministry of Information in 1945 as part of its publicity for utility fashion By 1941, Britain was two years into another global conflict. With the need to produce clothing and other war essentials for the expanding armed services during the Second World War, many items were once again rationed. Certain raw materials could no longer be imported, and those that could were directed towards the war effort. Food rationing had already been reintroduced in January 1940. Non- rationed items saw their price surge, and clothing saw large mark-ups in price, well above the cost of living. The government introduced the Limitation of Supply Orders that forced manufacturers to produce only a fraction of their pre-war amounts. By April 1940, the limits on cloth were having a major impact with a 25% cut in wool and rayon, and a 75% in linen. As a consequence manufacturers ended the production of any loss-making lines which led to calls for clothing rationing to be introduced. The prime minister, Winston Churchill, believed that the general public would not accept this change. In 1941, Oliver Lyttleton, the President of the Board of Trade managed to introduce clothing rationing. Churchill, although thankful the public accepted the move, replaced Lyttleton with Hugh Dalton (a Labour member of the coalition government since 1940) a month later. Churchill was fully aware that the necessary evils of rationing and conscription were now necessary as Britain became involved in a 'total war' spanning the globe. Shortly after Dalton took office he appointed Metford Watkins as Director of Civilian Clothing as the Board of Trade. Watkins, aware of the high price of clothes at the time, promised to introduce cheaper clothes via 'austerity' provisions but not, as had been done during the First World War, using standardisation. Shortly after the government announced the production of 'national footwear'. The austerity provisions governed exactly what could or could not be used in the manufacture of clothes and shoes (for example, number of buttons, pleats or pockets, height of heels, amount of lace or embroidery, no turn-ups on trousers and no double-breasted suits). With the introduction of purchase tax in October 1941, items were taxed at different rates and necessities were designated as tax-free. This stimulated production, reduced waste and through higher taxation curtailed the production of expensive clothing. Utility items CC41 utility mark and maker's marks impressed onto the rear of a wooden bookcase. Utility underwear, photographed in 1942 by the Ministry of Information Utility cloths were introduced and manufacturers were supplied with raw materials on a quota system. Manufacturers who agreed to increase production of Utility cloth would receive a higher quota. The public bought Utility clothing as it was tax-free. By September 1942, 40 cloths had been specified (19 wool, 16 cotton, four rayon and one locknit) which all now utilised the CC41 Utility mark, designed for the Directorate of Civilian Clothing by Reginald Shipp. Though the symbol was intended to mean nothing, the 'two cheeses' looked similar to CC and it was inferred they stood for Civilian Clothing (and not Controlled Cloth or Controlled Commodity). The symbol was to appear on clothing, footwear and furniture and the single, identifiable mark quickly allowed the public to know if an item was tax-free or not. However, the system had some initial flaws as some items were poorly produced but with time these problems were removed. The symbol came to represent cheap, but reliable goods. Within the Utility footwear there were sometimes bands for quality difference. Ladies shoes would feature the Utility mark and either W1, W2 or W3 which had a different and increasing price range. Post-war Though the Conservatives had hoped to scrap the Utility system after the war, with the Labour victory in the 1945 general election, the scheme ran until 1952 (and was withdrawn following the Conservatives returning to government that year).

The movement supported King Alexander's royal dictatorship (declared in 1929). The organization was claimed by others to be fascist, though the party itself denied this. It has been described as one of three notable fascist movements, the other being the Association of Fighters of Yugoslavia and the Yugoslav National Movement, that emerged in Yugoslavia in the 1930s, all of whom supported the monarchy, and would reach their zenith during the Axis occupation of Yugoslavia (1941‚Äì45). The organization adopted symbols imitating the NSDAP, such as a blue swastika and a raised right hand. It was merged along with other organizations, such as Boj (\\"Battle\\") in Slovenia, and groups surrounding the magazines of Zbor (\\"Council\\") and Otad≈æbina (\\"Homeland\\") based in Belgrade, and Budjenje (\\"Awakening\\") in Zrenjanin, to form the Yugoslav National Movement led by Dimitrije Ljotiƒá in early 1935.

Hawken appeared in a viral video which shows his scooter, apparently destroyed outside a dairy. The \\"nek minnit\\" video spawned many parodies and has become a popular slang term among the people of New Zealand. In a 2019 interview with RNZ, Hawken discussed the effects of the video on his well-being and his attempts to look for a 'silver lining' (albeit he acknowledges it to be clich√©). He has had a passion for skateboarding since a young age, and works on using concrete as a medium for building sculptures. The video Levi Hawken is a professional skateboarder (for Sector 9) from Dunedin, New Zealand who suffers from ectodermal dysplasia. The condition caused his hair and teeth to grow abnormally, which resulted in him being bullied as a child. In the \\"nek minnit\\" video, Hawken appears shirtless with a shaven head; his missing teeth have also been noted by many viewers. The video takes place in a Fairfield, Otago skatepark; Hawken announces, \\"Left my scooter outside the dairy; nek minnit ...\\", the camera then tilts to show Hawken's broken scooter. The nine-second-long clip was recorded for South in Your Mouth, an independent skate film by Colin Evans, Hawken's friend; however, the \\"nek minute\\" video was uploaded separately. The video was popularised in mid-2011, and was viewed on YouTube 600,000 times by late September 2011; at December 2011, the video had received over 1.5 million views. By August 2018, it had reached 4.4 million. The phrase \\"nek minute\\" was the sixth most searched term in New Zealand on internet search engine Google in 2011, and was voted the runner-up in the 2011 \\"Word of the Year\\" poll by website Public Address. Parodies The TV3 show The Jono Project ran a segment on one episode titled Food in a Nek Minnit each segment featured Levi Hawken and parodied the advertisements seen weeknights on TV One called Food in a Minute. The first clip had Hawken cooking a rather complex dish in a minute. A later clip had Hawken cooking two-minute noodles and after saying Nek minnit, Hawken decided the noodles might need another minute. Hawken also appears in a separate parody of another TV3 show, \\"60 Nek Minnits\\" (a parody of \\"60 Minutes\\"), as \\"Mike McMinnits\\" (instead of \\"Mike McRoberts\\"). The phrase nek minnit has been parodied by many people and organisations: * The New Zealand Drug Foundation wrote on Twitter: \\"In 2009 we conducted research into NZ drug driving habits, nek minnit we kicked off our driving high info project.\\" * Band Youth Empire released a single titled \\"Nek Minnit\\" on 7 October 2011. * During the New Zealand general election, 2011 campaign: **Conservative Party had billboards with \\"Nek minnit, Conservatives\\" written on them. ** New Zealand Labour Party referenced a YouTube video of the then NZ Prime Minister John Key, who was shown during the previous general election promising not to raise GST and then subsequently doing so after being elected. * Hawken has appeared in anti drink-driving advertisements in New Zealand, billed as \\"The Nek Minnit\\".\\"Dilemma\\" Drink- driving campaign ad.

In response to the shortage of clothing materials and labour due to wartime austerity, the Board of Trade sponsored the creation of ranges of \\"utility clothing\\" meeting tight regulations regarding the amount of material and labour allowed to be used in their construction. Utility clothing, and later utility furniture, was marked with the CC41 tag. In spite of its austere specifications, utility clothing designs were commissioned from leading fashion designers including Hardy Amies, Norman Hartnell and other members of the Incorporated Society of London Fashion Designers. Utility clothing During the war, the government took control of supplies of raw materials for manufacturing Utility garments. They imposed regulations which took into consideration the economic condition of the country. Conserving raw materials such as cloth, wool, leather etc. was advisable because of limited supplies. Manufacturers had their quota to produce Utility clothing which was 85% of the total production. The board of trade allowed the 15% left for the garment industry to create non-Utility clothing by meeting the style required in the regulations. The garment industry was encouraged to produce limited stocks in order to sustain the needs of civilians and reduce the choices available to buyers and to maintain an essential quantity of garments. Utility garments were liable to price control to be sold at low prices so that civilians could afford an outfit of reasonable quality. Utility clothing continued into children's wear, which also had the same CC41 label. In spite of regulations and the limitation of raw materials, manufacturers and the garment industry created a variety of styles and colours of Utility clothing of satisfactory quality. Utility shoes The design of Utility shoes was chunky and solid. They had wedges or low two inch heels. Wearing open-toed shoes was prohibited as impractical and unsafe. Details of CC41 Examples of details of restriction orders when making Utility dress: it could have no more than two pockets, five buttons, six seams in the skirt, two inverted or box pleats or four knife pleats, and one hundred and sixty inches (four metres) of stitching.

At the beginning of the American Revolutionary War he offered his services to the patriot cause and was named a lieutenant colonel in 1776. Later that year he became colonel commanding the 11th Pennsylvania Regiment. Tasked with collecting boats on the Delaware River, his attention to this assignment materially helped the Americans win the Battle of Trenton in December 1776. He commanded the 2nd Pennsylvania Brigade at Brandywine and Paoli in September 1777. After bringing charges against Anthony Wayne for Paoli, he led the 2nd Brigade at Germantown in October. He was present at Monmouth and assumed command of the 10th Pennsylvania Regiment shortly afterward. In January 1781 he took command of the 6th Pennsylvania Regiment and two years later he transferred to lead the 2nd Pennsylvania Regiment. He received a brevet promotion to brigadier general in September 1783 and retired to his farm. He later served as adjutant general of the state militia and was a member of the Society of the Cincinnati. He married Elizabeth Morris but the couple had no children.

First opened in April 2012, the prison is operated by G4S and was primed to be in full operation by autumn 2012. Originally called Featherstone 2 and designed to be a titan prison, it was downsized to hold up to 1,605 prisoners with construction starting in August 2009. It was built in a modular fashion, the first time this had been done in the UK. Following the announcement that it would be contracted out to a private company along with HMP Birmingham, the Prison Officers Association threatened industrial action. The prison also received heavy criticism following a surprise inspection by HM Inspector of Prisons; a report published by the inspectorate in October 2013 identified several issues of concern, including a high level of violence. History Projected initially as being a titan prison, and holding up to 2,500 offenders, it was downsized following the cancellation of the titan scheme. It was estimated at costing around ¬£180million and was described in the press as a \\"superprison\\". The prison is located next to existing prisons HMP Featherstone and HMYOI Brinsford and was constructed by Kier Build. Building the prison at that location required additional road remodelling to cope with an anticipated additional 1,400 rush-hour journeys down local roads. The A460 Cannock Road was remodelled at the junction with New Road in Featherstone, but the local council was criticised in the local press for not going far enough with the changes. Pre-construction on the prison site began in August 2009. The prison is the first to be built in a modular fashion in the UK, with pre-construction sections put in place that contain plumbing, electricity and fire alarm systems. The modules first arrived in February 2010, which formed the energy centre for the project. Once completed, the prison will comprise three house blocks and 13 other buildings. Although reported by some media outlets as being sold, it was contracted out to private service provider G4S in March 2011, for a period of fifteen years, along with HMP Birmingham, to become G4S‚Äô fifth and sixth prisons in England and Wales. Secretary of State for Justice Kenneth Clarke announced the outcome of the bidding process in the House of Commons, stating that Featherstone 2 would come in at ¬£31 million less than announced by the previous government. Following the announcement, the Prison Officers Association announced that its members were \\"angry\\" at the privatisation of public prisons. The association balloted its members to find out if they wanted to take industrial action over the issue, stating, \\"It is important to gauge the view of our members through the ballot box, and if it is their will the POA will take clear and decisive action against the privatisation of Birmingham and Featherstone 2.\\" Steve Gillian, the general secretary of the POA, said that \\"This is a disgraceful decision which is politically driven and morally repulsive.\\" The military were placed on standby should the POA take the threatened strike action. Clarke was questioned in the Commons at the time of the announcement by constituency MP Gavin Williamson regarding the levels of staff training provided to the new prison compared to the two other publicly run prisons also located nearby. He said in response to the query, \\"That is provided for in the contract and I very much hope it will be the case. Like my hon. Friend, I have great optimism about the future of Featherstone 2. It is very good that we have that kind of investment coming on stream so that we can help to modernise the service in all possible ways. The proper training and support of staff is a key part of delivering the contract properly.\\" The prison was officially named HMP Oakwood in December 2011, named after the oak tree in which Charles II was reputed to have hidden from Oliver Cromwell‚Äôs troops during the English Civil War, nearby in Boscobel Wood. HMP Oakwood took its first prisoners on 24 April 2012 with the goal of being fully operational by August or September the same year. Criticism In October 2013, the prison was criticised by HM Inspector of Prisons following a surprise inspection. Of particular concern to them was a high level of violence within the jail, concerns that staff were not properly experienced to deal with inmates, and fears that sex offenders were not having their offences addressed. Frances Crook of the Howard League for Penal Reform expressed concerns over the revelations, stating, \\"It is well-known in prison circles that this institution is referred to as 'Jokewood' by prisoners and staff across the system, but this isn't a joke ‚Äì it is deeply serious.\\" In response to the report, G4S said that steps were already being taken to improve the situation at Oakwood. It was subsequently reported that Prisons Ombudsman Nigel Newcomen had identified \\"serious failings\\" in a report into the death of an inmate at the jail. Newcomen reported that prison staff found the inmate collapsed and not breathing in his cell, but were unable to access a defibrillator because it was locked away. In January 2014, the prison again garnered controversy as it emerged that ambulances had been called there 358 times in 2013, which was over twice the amount of any other UK prison.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-25809660 References External links * G4S pages on Oakwood G4S Oakwood Prisons in Staffordshire 2012 establishments in England Private prisons in the United Kingdom ","title":"HM Prison Oakwood"},{"id":"34241603","text":"Mike Vermeille (born April 5, 1992) is a Swiss ice hockey defenceman.

Born in Prestwich, Lancashire, to a family who lived in humble circumstances, he taught himself to read, and learned the basic principles of botany. Although living as a pauper for most of his life, in 1849 he published A Botanical Guide to the Flowering Plants, Ferns, Mosses and Alg√¶, Found Indigenous Within Sixteen Miles of Manchester, which became one of the standard texts on the flora then commonly found in the Manchester area. According to his obituary in the Journal of Botany, British and Foreign, Buxton was one of \\"nature's gentlemen\\" and \\"his true and correct pronunciation of scientific terms have caused many who heard him to believe he was an accomplished classical scholar\\". He was acknowledged by the geologist Edward William Binney as \\"the most profound thinker of his class\\". Early life The second of seven children, Richard Buxton was born on 15 January 1786 at Sedgley Hall Farm in the parish of Prestwich, near Manchester, Lancashire. His parents were John and Anne Buxton (n√©e Horton), both from Derbyshire. When he was two years old his family fell on hard times, left their farm and moved to Bond Street in Ancoats, Manchester. John Buxton worked as a labourer for the rest of his life. Veronica chamaedrys (Germander Speedwell) Richard was a sickly child and his parents' reduced circumstances meant that his education was somewhat sporadic. In his early years he wandered through the fields and brick yards where he lived, picking wildflowers. His favourites were Germander Speedwell, Creeping Tormentil and Common Chickweed. At the age of twelve he was apprenticed to a bat maker (the maker of children's small leather shoes) named James Heap, in Port Street, Manchester. About 18 months later he went to work with James Hyde, with whom he stayed for a number of years. Later life At the age of 16, Buxton was illiterate, but with the aid of The Common Spelling Book he taught himself to read. He was unable to understand or pronounce all words correctly and so procured a copy of Jones Pronouncing Dictionary. He read more books, such as A History of England and Goldsmith's History of Greece and Rome. Reading occupied all his spare time, although when trade was good he had to work from 6:00 am until 9:00 pm. He earned about 14 to 15 shillings (70p-75p) a week, a good wage for the time, but as cloth was superseding leather in making the tops of children shoes, this did not last. When he was 18, Buxton returned to work with his old master, James Heap, as a journeyman. Heap often took Buxton on country walks in his spare time. The two collected herbs for diet drinks, either for Heap's use or to share with his neighbours. They often found plants of whose names they were ignorant, and so Buxton bought a copy of Culpeper's Complete Herbal. However, as he found the supposedly medicinal properties of the plants fanciful and the descriptions inaccurate, he soon became dissatisfied with it. In 1808 he procured a copy of the superior Meyrick's Herbal, from which he learned the first principles of the Linnaean system. Buxton soon outgrew this book, and began to borrow or buy as many books on botany as he could. Botanical practice at the time was to collect and dry plants, but as he disliked dead plants and preferred not to remove specimens that could be enjoyed by others, his botanical studies were confined to making observations. From 1821 to 1826 the pressures of work took him away from his botanical rambles, but in spring 1826 he made more frequent excursions. In June that year he was \\"botanising\\" on Kersal Moor when he met John Horsefield, a handloom weaver from Whitefield, who was president of the Prestwich Botanical Society and president of the general botanical meetings held at a number of different places in Lancashire. Buxton had long wished to meet a man such as Horsefield, who was not merely a country herbalist but an excellent scientific botanist. At that time in Lancashire many amateur, working class, naturalists pursued their interests in their spare time, and a number of local societies had been formed. Horsefield introduced him to other local botanists such as James Percival, Thomas Heywood and John Shaw with whom, during the summer of 1826, he made a number of excursions to Mere Clough in Prestwich, Clifton Moss and Baguley Moor. For several years, for a variety of reasons, Buxton's study of botany fell by the wayside, but in 1833 he attended a botanical meeting in Prestwich, where he met his old acquaintances. He became a regular attendee at local botanical meetings, including one at Blackley, where he met James Crowther. They became firm friends and, in search of plants, explored Chorlton, Withington, Didsbury and many other regions of Lancashire, Cheshire, Derbyshire, Yorkshire and Wales. In 1839 Buxton was invited to join the natural history class at the Manchester Mechanics' Institute where he helped compile the Flora Mancuniensis (1840) along with Leo Hartley Grindon, George Crozier and James Crowther under the editorship of John Bland Wood. He became an acknowledged expert on mosses, and William Hooker, director of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew was so impressed with his skills that he hoped to employ him as a herbarium assistant. Although this never came about, Hooker gave Buxton a number of botanical books and, at some point, Buxton accepted the position of President of the Manchester Working Men's Botanical Society. In 1849, aged 62, he published a book: A Botanical Guide to the Flowering Plants, Ferns, Mosses and Alg√¶, Found Indigenous Within Sixteen Miles of Manchester, written with the help of other local botanists and geologist Edward William Binney. Peppered with snatches of poetry and including some autobiographical details, the book gives a complete description of all the plants then found in the area. It encourages other working-class people to explore the \\"many delightful walks by pleasant streams and through green woods in summertime\\" and requests landowners \\"at least to preserve the old footpaths which cross their fields and woods if they should decline to allow fresh ones to be made\\". As Buxton's trade fell into decline he tried to survive by working as a botanical collector and delivering newspapers, but eventually had to rely on a fund set up by Binney for 'the relief and encouragement of scientific men in humble life'. This situation was compounded when the proceeds from the second edition of his book, published in 1859, were less than anticipated because of competition from Grindon's Manchester Flora published in the same year. Richard Buxton's grave Death Buxton died on 2 January 1865 at Limekiln Lane, Ardwick, aged 81 and was buried at the Church of St Mary the Virgin, Prestwich, on 5 January. In his obituary in the Manchester Courier, an unnamed \\"eminent man of science\\" described him as \\"probably one of the best British botanists, so far as flowering plants are concerned, that Lancashire has produced\\".

It contributes to the stability of financial systems by enhancing the effectiveness of deposit insurance and promoting international cooperation on deposit insurance and bank resolution arrangements in active partnership with other international organisations. IADI draws upon its membership to provide guidance on the establishment or enhancement of effective deposit insurance systems, as well as technical assistance outreach, educational programs and research. Founded in 2002, IADI is a non-profit organisation constituted under Swiss law and domiciled at the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) in Basel, Switzerland. Along with the other standard setters and committees hosted and supported by the BIS, IADI is a part of the Basel Process, sharing with its host and peers the common goal of global financial stability and ensuring that jurisdictions‚Äô financial systems operate effectively, support economic growth, and interact in an increasingly global environment. IADI's standards, outlined in its Core Principles for Effective Deposit Insurance Systems (Core Principles), are part of the Key Standards for Sound Financial Systems of the Financial Stability Board (FSB); and are used in the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) reviews conducted by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. As a member of the FSB's Resolution Steering Group, IADI contributes to the design of international standards and guidance for effective resolution regimes.  Governance and Organisation  IADI is governed by the General Meeting of its Members and IADI Executive Council (EXCO). The General Meeting elects the officers of IADI, including the President and Treasurer. The current President, Katsunori Mikuniya, Governor of the Deposit Insurance Corporation of Japan, is serving a two-year term beginning October 2017. EXCO ensures the smooth functioning of IADI's affairs, and is structured as an inclusive body which involves the active participation of its membership. There are currently 25 EXCO members and they are elected at the IADI Annual General Meeting (AGM), typically to serve three-year terms. EXCO establishes committees to support IADI's objectives. As of November 2015, there are seven Standing Committees and eight Regional Committees. The details about IADI's governance and organisational structure can be found on IADI website with _the underscore link_.  Secretariat  The IADI Secretariat, which is based in Basel, Switzerland, manages the daily business and affairs of the Association. It is led by Secretary General David Walker. The Secretariat supports IADI's agenda and the implementation of its mission, goals and strategic priorities. Details about the Secretariat can be found on IADI website with _the underscore link_.  Membership  IADI has three categories of Membership participation, as well as Partners. As of June 2016, there are 115 participating organisations including 91 Members, 10 Associates and 14 Partners. The full list of IADI participants can be found on IADI website with _the underscore link_.  Core Principles for Effective Deposit Insurance Systems  To enhance deposit insurance effectiveness and meet its Members‚Äô needs, IADI undertakes research and issues core principles and supporting guidance. The Core Principles for Effective Deposit Insurance Systems (Core Principles) were first issued by IADI and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) in June 2009, and updated by IADI in October 2014. IADI's Core Principles promote best international standards in deposit insurance and support the stability and soundness of financial systems. IADI, in collaboration with the BCBS, IMF, the World Bank, European Forum of Deposit Insurers (EFDI) and European Commission developed a Methodology for the Assessment of Compliance with the Core Principles. Such assessments include self-assessments and Financial Sector Assessment Programs (FSAPs) reviews conducted by IMF and the World Bank, as well as country and peer review programs conducted by the FSB. Being a part of the FSB Compendium of Key Standards for Sound Financial Systems, the IADI Core Principles are used by international community in assessing the condition of financial systems. A comprehensive, credible and action-oriented assessment of a deposit insurer against the Core Principles identifies strengths and weaknesses in an existing system and forms a basis for improvement measures by policymakers. Proper application of the IADI Core Principles gives significant advantage in the pursuit of financial stability, pairing the right protection for retail depositors with more multifaceted aspects of crisis management. The details about the Core Principles can be found on IADI website with _the underscore link_.  Research and Guidance  One of IADI's key objectives is to facilitate sharing expertise and information on deposit insurance issues. IADI produces research, discussion and guidance papers. The research projects are conducted under the auspices of the Core Principles and Research Council Committee with the objective of providing academia, policy makers, deposit insurers and other interested parties with guidance and research data to improve the effectiveness of deposit insurance system in their respective jurisdictions.

Their existence is confirmed by the Tannu-Ola mountains inscriptions of Mugur-Sargol and Bayan-Kol and certain verses of the G√∂kt√ºrks, while describing the battles between the G√∂kt√ºrks and the Kyrgyz. According to the Bayan-Kol inscriptions, the Az were divided to many clans living in the region of Mugur west of the Tannu-Ola mountains. There are also writings from the 8th century (around 714 AD) in Uyghur sources about the uprising of the Az against the G√∂kt√ºrks. The origin of the Az is disputed; but most researchers agree that they are without much doubt a people of non-Turkic origin who were influenced by neighboring Turkic people and became Turkophones. Most research has been done by Russian linguist experts who trace them as close ethnically to Ket people of Yenisei basin in Siberia due to similarities in name between Old Turkic ê∞îê∞âê∞Üê∞ëê∞£ Az budun and the Assans, who spoke an extinct Yeniseic Kott dialect.BARTHOLD Wilhelm, 12 Vorlesungen √ºber die Geschichte der T√ºrken Mittelasiens, Berlin, Arthur Collignon, Deutsche Gesellschaft f√ºr Islamkunde, 1935, p37 The primary information on their language was collected by Matthias Castr√©n in 1845, with further research and information added later by the anthropologist Dmitry Anuchin.

This Saulteaux reserve is connected to the Keeseekoose First Nation and only a couple of miles from the Key First Nation. Their land is situated just south of the boreal forest in the aspen parkland ecosystem of Canada. The Ojibwe of this region of Saskatchewan and Manitoba, were both hunters of the plains bison and hunters of the forests which were more abundant during the 19th century. They also fished the endless lakes and other waterways in their country. They seldom went hungry as a result of the large bison herds. However, by the 1870s, commercial hunting had reduced the bison to near extinction and the Ojibwe of Saskatchewan and Manitoba began to suffer from famine.  History  Historically, the people of Cote have lived in Saskatchewan and neighbouring Manitoba, for at least 250 to 300 years. After the Europeans arrived, it forced many Ojibwe people to retreat towards the west as well as to the north. By the late 19th century the Europeans had forced their way into the eastern Saskatchewan region and then commenced to negotiate with Cote leaders. Among them was Chief Mƒ´Mƒ´Y (Gabriel Cot√©, Mee- may, Pigeon), who signed Treaty 4 on September 15, 1874. A reserve was surveyed in 1877. It established the Cote First Nation and then eventually the Keeseekoose First Nation which was originally a part of the Swan River First Nation of Manitoba, before floods commenced and forced a relocation. It is not known if the Ojibwe people of eastern Saskatchewan participated in the 1885 Northwest Rebellion but their land was quite far from the major battle scenes of the conflict. The Cote Ojibweg were probably affiliated with Chief Yellow Quill and also Chief Kinistin during the 19th century. Reserves Cote was originally a larger reserve connected to the Keeseekoose First Nation. Today the Cote have one reserve of and share Treaty Four Reserve Grounds Indian Reserve No. 77 with 33 other Treaty 4 First Nations.

Nearly the entire road is within the city limits of Rockmart. Its entire length is concurrent with State Route 6 Business (SR 6 Bus.). US 278 Bus./SR 6 Bus. begins at an intersection with US 278/SR 6 west of Rockmart. It travels to the southeast and immediately crosses over the Silver Comet Trail. The roadway is known as Cedartown Highway until an intersection with Prospect Road. Then it is known as Elm Street. It enters the city limits of Rockmart and passes by Rose Hill Cemetery. Then, it crosses over Euharlee Creek and the Silver Comet Trail again on the Raymond Lester Bridge. The highway then curves to the east, at an intersection with Slate Street. At Piedmont Avenue, the business route turns to the north, remaining along that street for the rest of its journey. At an intersection with Clearwater Street, it curves to the north-northwest. Finally, it ends an intersection with US 278/SR 6/SR 101. In 1991, SR 6 Bus. was established on its current path. Between the beginning of 1989 and the beginning of 1995, US 278 Bus. was established on the path of SR 6 Bus.

US 278 Byp./SR 12 Byp. begins at mainline US 278/SR 12, which turns from southeast to straight east as those highways head into historic downtown Warrenton. It crosses over Goldens Creek and then crosses over a former Central of Georgia Railway line before encountering the intersection with SR 16, which is the former path of SR 12 Conn. After the intersection of Shoal Street, the highway begins to curve east in front of the right-of-way of a former connecting ramp to SR 16\\\\. The road serves as the northern terminus of SR 171 across from the Warren School Bus Shop, and then begins to curve to the northeast, even more so when it approaches SR 80 (Quaker Road) which joins the bypass in a concurrency.

While every compact Riemannian manifold is also geodesically complete (by the Hopf‚ÄìRinow theorem), this space shows that the same implication does not generalize to pseudo-Riemannian manifolds.. It is named after Yeaton H. Clifton and William F. Pohl, who described it in 1962 but did not publish their result.. Definition Consider the manifold \\\\mathrm{M} = \\\\mathbb{R}^2 \\\\smallsetminus \\\\\\\\{0\\\\\\\\} with the metric :g= \\\\frac{dx\\\\,dy}{\\\\tfrac 1 2 (x^2+y^2)} Any homothety is an isometry of M, in particular including the map: :\\\\lambda(x,y)=2\\\\cdot(x, y) Let \\\\Gamma be the subgroup of the isometry group generated by \\\\lambda. Then \\\\Gamma has a proper, discontinuous action on M. Hence the quotient T = M/\\\\Gamma, which is topologically the torus, is a Lorentz surface that is called the Clifton‚ÄìPohl torus. Sometimes, by extension, a surface is called a Clifton‚ÄìPohl torus if it is a finite covering of the quotient of M by any homothety of ratio different from \\\\pm 1. Geodesic incompleteness It can be verified that the curve :\\\\sigma(t) := \\\\left(\\\\frac 1 {1-t},0\\\\right) is a geodesic of M that is not complete (since it is not defined at t=1). Consequently, M (hence also T) is geodesically incomplete, despite the fact that T is compact. Similarly, the curve :\\\\sigma(t) := (\\\\tan(t), 1) is a null geodesic that is incomplete. In fact, every null geodesic on M or T is incomplete. The geodesic incompleteness of the Clifton‚ÄìPohl torus is better seen as a direct consequence of the fact that (M,g) is extendable, i.e. that it can be seen as a subset of a bigger Lorentzian surface. It is a direct consequence of a simple change of coordinates. With : N =\\\\left(-\\\\pi/2,\\\\pi/2\\\\right)^2 \\\\smallsetminus \\\\\\\\{0\\\\\\\\}; consider :F : N \\\\to M :F(u,v) := (\\\\tan(u),\\\\tan(v)). The metric F^*g (i.e. the metric g expressed in the coordinates (u,v)) reads : \\\\widehat{g\\\\,} =\\\\frac{du\\\\,dv}{\\\\tfrac{1}{2}(\\\\cos(u)^2\\\\sin(v)^2+\\\\sin(u)^2\\\\cos(v)^2)}. But this metric extends naturally from N to \\\\mathbb R^2 \\\\smallsetminus \\\\Lambda, where : \\\\Lambda =\\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\tfrac \\\\pi 2 (k,\\\\ell)\\\\ \\\\mid\\\\ (k,\\\\ell)\\\\in \\\\mathbb Z^2, k+\\\\ell\\\\equiv 0 \\\\pmod 2 \\\\right\\\\\\\\}. The surface (\\\\mathbb R^2 \\\\smallsetminus \\\\Lambda, \\\\widehat{g\\\\,}), known as the extended Clifton‚ÄìPohl plane, is geodesically complete. Conjugate points The Clifton‚ÄìPohl tori are also remarkable by the fact that they are the only non-flat Lorentzian tori with no conjugate points that are known. The extended Clifton‚ÄìPohl plane contains a lot of pairs of conjugate points, some of them being in the boundary of (-\\\\pi/2,\\\\pi/2)^2 i.e. \\"at infinity\\" in M .

Map of buildings destroyed by fire, published in La Minerve, July 15, 1852. The Great Fire of 1852 was a fire in Montreal that began on July 8, 1852, and left as many as 10,000 people homeless (at a time when the city's population was only 57,000) and destroyed almost half of the city's housing. The fire occurred at a time when the city's recently constructed reservoir, located at the site of today's Saint-Louis Square, was drained and closed for repairs. The first fire broke out at a tavern on St. Lawrence Boulevard and spread quickly, fanned by strong winds and hot, dry summer weather. The fire that started on St. Lawrence originated from a wooden house, as was typical at the time. It spread from there to the block in between Saint Denis Street and Craig Street (now Saint Antoine Street). The flames engulfed the Saint Jacques Cathedral, the hospital on Dorchester Street and the Theatre Royal. Within hours, one quarter of Montreal was destroyed.http://grandquebec.com/montreal-histoire/incendie-montreal-1852/ Before the Great Fire of 1852 Montreal was founded in 1642. Wealthy French-Canadians moved to the area in search of a new place to settle. The new colony formed a government and educational system, which grew as the years went on. Later on in Montreal's history, the diversity of citizens increased as work became more available. This meant mostly Irish and Chinese, who came to North America in search of work but ironically were the ones who were most affected by the fire. Prior to Great Fire of 1852, there were several other fires and problems that occurred. The most notable was when the Parliament building was set ablaze in 1849. The city was in economic turmoil and this left houses and stores with out any business or tenants. Following the parliament building blaze, there were four more major blazes in the early 1850s that consumed many of Montreal's housing districts. These fires destroyed over 350 different buildings in the span of two years. This, however, was nowhere near the number of homes engulfed by the Great Fire of July 8 and 9 of 1852. Montreal Fire Department The Montreal Fire Brigade originated as a volunteer service which was not particularly effective in combating fires. Early on, the only way to obtain water was by going to public water pumps, private wells, or to a nearby river or lake. While combating fires, it would be incredibly difficult for volunteer firefighters to go from the burning houses, back to the water supply, and back again to the blaze. This would take too much time, allowing the fire to rage on. One way to solve this problem was to have carters going from the water supply to the homes in Montreal. These carters would carry buckets of water to the city and try to get there before any other carters could. This was due to the incentive of three dollars extra pay for getting there first. This of course would cause for the carters to rush, not fill the bucket all the way, or spill some of the water on their way over to the house. Spilling water would cause major problems while fighting fires because there would not be enough to put out a house fire and once they ran out of water, the fire would rage out of control. The Montreal Fire Brigade at the time of the July 8‚Äì9, 1852 fire was a group of around 12 volunteer firefighters. The coordinator of this company of volunteers was a man named John Perrigo. Perrigo was not the best fire chief that had ever served the people of Montreal and his actions to combat the fire demonstrated this. His main plan was to destroy buildings that were on fire to cause a firebreak. The few volunteer firefighters were no match for the fire. They required help from soldiers to dismantle buildings in order to stop the destruction.\\"The Great Fire of Montreal.\\" Accessed September 8, 2014. http://ericsquire.com/articles/mtl/fire1852.htm. The professional era of the fire brigade came to be in the late nineteenth century. The city's government found it too expensive to hire the manpower to operate the equipment that had been used previously. The new steam fire engine allowed the city to hire the men who were trained in the use of the machinery and in the art of firefighting. This new technology and the need for professional firefighters changed the Montreal Fire Brigade forever. Aftermath The disaster led to the construction of a newer and larger reservoir and to the dismissal of the city's chief engineer, who had coordinated Montreal's all-volunteer fire companies, for failing to respond quickly enough to stop the spread of the blaze. New architecture After the fire, Montreal began to urbanize and industrialize. With the progressive movement, newer and safer houses needed to be built in order to provide shelter to the new inhabitants of the city. New fireproof technology was introduced to building architecture in order to prevent destructive fires. Much of the blame for the disaster was attributed to the wooden gutters that were used in Montreal at the time. When the gutters caught fire, they caused the rafters to be set ablaze as well, which caused the inside of the buildings be engulfed as well as the fire grew.Redfern, Bruce D. \\"The Montreal Fire Department in the Nineteenth Century: Its Transformation from a Volunteer to a Professional Organization.\\" Concordia University, 1993. A witness to the rebuilding stage stated that the new buildings were of greater quality and that the lots that were not being built on were some of the best areas in the city.

They also hunted the forest for deer, moose and other wild game. Their country was teaming with incredible numbers of waterways which they utilized for more food.

Shugaba Darman was a founding member of the Great Nigeria People's Party and was elected as a member of the Borno State House of Assembly in 1979 where he also became the house Majority Leader. Deportation On January 24, 1980, Immigration officers arrested Alhaji Darman on the strength of a deportation order signed by the Federal Minister of internal affairs Alhaji Bello Maitama. The deportation order entitled \\"Shugaba Abdurrahman Darman's Deportation Order 1980\\", stated amongst other things that \\"...Shugaba Abdurrahman Darman at present in Nigeria ought to be classified as a prohibited immigrant\\" and also that \\"Shugaba Abdurrahman be deported from Nigeria by the first available means....\\" Shugaba Darman was promptly deported to a village in Chad. In response to the public outcry against the obviously politically motivated deportation, the government instituted a one-man tribunal of inquiry presided over by Justice P.C Okanbo. The NPN government and President Shehu Shagari in particular were quite concerned about the negative press that the issue was generating and also about allusions in the press to the partiality of the tribunal. Shugaba Darman's troubles had allegedly started as a result of him being regarded as a threat by the ruling party of the time, the National Party of Nigeria (NPN). Shugaba Darman was a charismatic politician who attracted large crowds at political rallies, the crowds were drawn to his speeches in which he criticized the ruling NPN government. The government claimed that Shugaba's father was a Chadian hence he was from Chad. During the subsequent court case filed by the GNPP led legal team of Chief D. O.A Oguntoye, to challenge the deportation order, the government brought a Chadian woman who claimed that Shugaba was her biological son whom she wanted back; this while weeping profusely. Shugaba denied knowing the woman and claimed that his mother was alive and well known in Maiduguri even though her sight was now poor. The Maiduguri high court ruled in Shugaba's favour in the case of \\"Shugaba Darman vs Federal Minister of Internal Affairs and Others\\", revoked the deportation order and awarded damages to the tune of 350,000 Naira to Shugaba. The government appealed the verdict at the appeal court in Kaduna and lost. The case was then taken to the Supreme Court and that court yet again ruled in Shugaba's favour in a unanimous judgement by the four justices led by Justice Coker. The case was overtaken by the subsequent military coup and no compensation was paid; Shugaba said he had forgiven the Shagari led government for his deportation. Legacy Alhaji Shugaba Darman died on Wednesday April 20, 2010 at the age of 80, he left behind three wives and 29 children. Alhaji Shugaba was a founding member of the Shehu Musa Yar'Adua led Social Democratic Party (SDP), he was also a founding member of the People's Democratic Party (PDP) in which he was active as a party elder till he died. Perhaps his greatest legacy has been his legal battle with the federal government challenging his deportation; the case has been used as relevant case law in numerous human rights trials in Nigeria ever since. The judgement in itself was ground-breaking and has set a precedent for subsequent cases of human rights violation against the government.

The line extends the Chomutov‚ÄìVejprty/Reitzenhain railway at Vejprty (Weipert), crossing the Czech- German border and running via Cranzahl to Annaberg-Buchholz. It has been operated since 2001 by Erzgebirgsbahn, which is part of DB Regio.  History  After the opening of the Chemnitz‚ÄìAnnaberg line in 1866, the Annaberger Eisenbahncomitee (Annaberg railway committee) called for a continuation of the line through the Ore Mountains (Erzgebirge) to Bohemia. At the time, the only line on the south side of the Erzgebirge was the Aussig-Teplitz Railway (Aussig-Teplitzer Eisenbahn), connecting Aussig (now √öst√≠ nad Labem) and Teplitz (now Teplice). On 28 August 1865, the Annaberg committee finally procured the grant of a concession by the Austrian government for a \\"Bohemian‚ÄìSaxon connecting railway\\" (S√§chsisch-B√∂hmische Verbindungsbahn) to connect the Buschtƒõhrad Railway (Buschtƒõhrader Eisenbahn, , named after Buschtƒõhrad) at Katschitz. The Austro-Prussian War of 1866 prevented it being built, however, and the concession expired. On 1 July 1868, the Buschtƒõhrader Railway received a new concession for a Komotau‚ÄìWeipert line, which was approved together with the line from Prague via Komotau (Chomutov) to Eger (Cheb). On 29 September 1869, Austria-Hungary concluded a treaty with the Kingdom of Saxony for the realisation of a \\"rail connection to the Bohemian- Saxon border near Weipert, Georgswalde and Warnsdorf\\". Saxony undertook to complete the line from Weipert to Annaberg by 1 July 1871. If no private investor could be found for the construction of the line, it would be built at public expense. For the construction on line on Saxon territory, the Annaberg railway committee founded the Saxon-Bohemian Connecting Railway, Annaberg- Weipert, Company (Gesellschaft der S√§chsisch-B√∂hmischen Verbindungsbahn Annaberg‚ÄìWeipert), which received a concession for the construction of the railway from the border to Annaberg on 19 April 1870. The Franco-Prussian War, along with the severe winter of 1870/1871, delayed the completion of the line, originally planned for 1871, several times. The Buschtƒõhrad Railway eventually opened the Komotau-Weipert line on 1 August 1872. Three days later, on 3 August 1872, the Weipert‚ÄìAnnaberg line also went into operation for general traffic. Operations were taken over by the Royal Saxon State Railways (K√∂niglich S√§chsische Staatseisenbahnen) using its own resources in return for 50 per cent of gross revenue. The Buschtƒõhrad Railway owned the section within Austria-Hungary from Weipert to the border, which was operated on lease.  Operations until 1945  Until the construction of the line through Reitzenhain (Fl√∂ha Valley Railway/Chomutov‚ÄìReitzenhain line), the line through Weipert was the only cross-border rail link through the Ore Mountains. When that line opened on 23 August 1875, the route via Weipert lost a significant portion of its through traffic. The now unprofitable line was acquired by the Saxon government on 12 August 1878. The Saxon-Bohemian Connecting Railway, Annaberg-Weipert, Company was dissolved. Despite the continued operation of the railway across the border until 1945 there were no continuous passenger trains between Chemnitz and Chomutov. All trains from Chemnitz ended at the Weipert border station, where passengers switched to the trains of the Buschtƒõhrad Railway and later of the Czechoslovak State Railways. Freight trains stopped in Weipert for a change of locomotives.  After the Second World War  After the Second World War cross-border rail traffic came to a standstill. Trains from Fl√∂ha only ran as far as B√§renstein. For strategic reasons, however, the railway connection remained open. It was not used except for a few service runs‚Äîfor instance for snow clearing. From the 1970s, Deutsche Reichsbahn planned the closing of traffic on the B√§renstein‚ÄìCranzahl section. The oil crisis of 1981 and the relocation of wagonload traffic from J√∂hstadt to B√§renstein due to the closure of the Wolkenstein‚ÄìJ√∂hstadt narrow- gauge railway led to the abandonment of this plan. In the 1980s only four pairs of passenger trains ran between B√§renstein and Cranzahl on weekdays and on Saturdays and Sundays only two ran. Between Cranzahl and Fl√∂ha, however, there were eight daily services, including a semi-fast service to and from Leipzig Central Station.  New outlook  The line gained a new lease of life as a result of the political upheaval in East Germany and in Czechoslovakia in 1989 and 1990. After decades of separation, both sides wished to renew old traditional transport links across the border. It was hoped to restore passenger services from the timetable change in June 1991 on three cross-border routes between Saxony and Bohemia, including between Vejprty and B√§renstein. This date could not be met. The biggest obstacle for scheduled traffic was the border bridge, which was cleared only for an axle load of 15 tonnes and a load per metre of 5.5 tons. In June 1992, the Saxon Ministry of Industry finally allocated DM 250,000 to carry out the necessary repairs to the bridge. Erzgebirgsbahn DMU in Annaberg-Buchholz upper station (2006) On 1 August 1993, four pairs of cross-border passenger trains were able to resume on the route between Chemnitz and Vejprty. Due to the tonnage limit on the border bridge, however, it was not initially possible to operate freight trains. The reconstruction of the bridge was finally funded under the EU Phare program and implemented between 14 April and 24 August 1997. Since then the cross-border route is also open for freight traffic. All passenger services on the line are currently operated by Siemens Desiro diesel multiple units (class 642). The service runs via Annaberg-Buchholz and Fl√∂ha to Chemnitz, where there are more connections to the surrounding area. The trains run between Cranzahl and Chemnitz every two hours. On weekends an excursion train runs on the Leipzig‚ÄìChemnitz‚ÄìVejprty‚ÄìChomutov route. Passenger fares are regulated by the Verkehrsverbund Mittelsachsen (Transport Association of Central Saxony). Since 11 December 2011, the section between Vejprty and Cranzahl was only served on weekends, with three pairs of trains running. On weekdays there is little tourist trade. From 14 December 2014 on there are no more timetabled passenger trains between Cranzahl and Vejprty, the weekend excursion trains to Chomutov have also been stopped.Erzgebirgsbahn.de: Timetable of trains from Chemnitz to Cranzahl, effective 14 December 2014 (in German), accessed 23 July 2015 In freight transport, the route is operated only as needed.  Route  Simplified altitude profile of the line The line leaves the border station of Vejprty to the north, immediately thereafter crossing a viaduct over the P√∂hlbach, which is the national border. In Saxony, the line initially follows an artificial water channel (Kunstgraben), which was built in the 16th century and called the Annaberger Flo√ügraben. In K√∂nigswalde upper station the line crosses the watershed to the Sehma valley in a deep cutting and then descends its eastern flank running to the southwest to Cranzahl. It crosses the Sehma on a viaduct and then runs to the north next to the Sehma to Annaberg-Buchholz.  Operating points  = Vejprty station = Vejprty station (1993) Vejprty station (called by its German name of Weipert until 1945) is the border station between the Czech Republic and Germany. The once extensive facilities of the station have been closed with progressive decline in cross-border traffic since 1945. Only a small part of the large entrance building is now used. The northern wing, which was formerly used by Saxon officials was renovated in 2008. As of 2011, Vejprty is still served by freight traffic. = K√∂nigswalde Upper station = From 1906 to 1996 the branch line to Annaberg-Buchholz upper station branched off from the station. It was served almost exclusively for freight. = Cranzahl Station = Cranzahl station (2010) At Cranzahl station, the narrow-gauge Cranzahl‚ÄìOberwiesenthal railway has branched off since 1897.

Having moved back to England, he was the executive producer for interactive at CBBC, the BBC's programming strand for children, and an executive producer of the live action comedy Big Babies broadcast by that network. Asher is also the creator and author of ‚ÄúThe Ghostkeeper's Journal & Field Guide‚Äù, the first ever augmented reality powered novel, published in 2018 by Carlton Books. Asher is considered a pioneer in the field of augmented reality storytelling, and has won multiple awards for the books with apps he has developed in this medium. Asher wrote and produced his first television film for the American Broadcasting Company, Peace on Borrowed Time, when he was 21 years old, during 1982; it aired the following year. The 1985 HBO documentary Soldiers in Hiding, of which Asher was a producer and writer, was nominated for an Academy Award. As a partner in the San Francisco-based studio (Colossal) Pictures during the late 1980s and 1990s he was the creator of the MTV animated showcase Liquid Television and a key figure in its execution, serving as executive producer and creative director. He was also an executive producer and writer for √Üon Flux, a segment of the programme which later became its own show. Between 1995 and 1997, he was the executive vice- president of programming at Tele-TV, an ultimately abortive joint venture by three American telephone companies to provide interactive television, video on demand and internet through customers' phone lines. Career in film and television Born in London, England, Asher attended Winchester College for five terms, before moving to San Francisco, California with his family. He graduated from New York's Tisch School of the Arts and worked extensively alongside director Malcolm Clarke during the 1980s. In 1982, when Asher was 21, the duo collaborated on a television film for the American Broadcasting Company, Peace on Borrowed Time, which aired the following year with Asher credited as writer and producer. Asher held both of these roles on two more documentaries directed by Clarke for HBO; the second of these, 1985's Soldiers in Hiding, about Vietnam veterans, was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature, but lost out to Broken Rainbow, a documentary about the relocation of Navajo Native Americans. Asher's sole release as a director, the television documentary Trouble on Big Mountain, also focussed on the Navajo and was released by San Francisco's KQED network in 1986. During the late 1980s and 1990s Asher became involved in animation as a partner in the San Francisco-based production house (Colossal) Pictures, most notably as creator, executive producer and creative director of the animation showcase Liquid Television, which was first broadcast in 1991 on MTV. \\"We're not interested in boring TV,\\" Asher told the Los Angeles Times soon after its premi√®re on 2 June that year; \\"it's zap-free TV. If you're not liking something you're watching, wait two minutes and you'll see something else ... Wait till you see Madonna doing Express Yourself.\\" He elaborated on this in an interview with Entertainment Weekly: \\"It's part fun house, part laboratory experiment. It's a mix of dozens of different animation styles. There's never been a TV show quite like it before.\\" Liquid Television was described by Los Angeles Times reporter Lauren Litpon as \\"state-of-the-art animation ... unlike anything else television has to offer\\". It crammed about 15 unrelated, mostly animated segments into each half-hour slot at a vastly accelerated pace, linking them together with yet more animation. Violently and deliberately different from the rest of the TV schedule, it was nominated for two Primetime Emmy Awards during its four-year run, winning one, and included as one of its cartoons √Üon Flux, directed by Peter Chung with Asher as an executive producer and writer. √Üon Flux became a standalone series in 1992 and ran until 1995. Asher appeared as a voice actor on each of these shows, writing and performing the recurring \\"Psychogram\\" skit on Liquid Television and voicing the character \\"Clavius\\" in an episode of √Üon Flux. Despite the success of both Liquid Television and √Üon Flux, Asher later came in for criticism from Mike Judge, the creator of Beavis and Butt-head, a successful animated programme initially featured on Liquid Television. Judge was being interviewed by the British magazine loaded in 1997 when the subject turned to the dislike of anything British by the title characters of Beavis and Butt-head. \\"You know,\\" Judge said, \\"This just now occurred to me. There was this guy called Japhet Asher who was sort of in charge of Liquid Television. ... He struck me as one of these British people who come over here [to America] and people think they're smart just because they have a British accent. ... He would say things like, 'A bit of criticism, if I may, Mike.' I wonder if a lot of that is just down to him.\\" Asher left (Colossal) in November 1995 when he was appointed executive vice-president of programming at the newly set-up Tele-TV network, a joint venture by the Bell Atlantic, NYNEX and Pacific Telesis telephone companies to provide interactive television, video on demand and internet to customers through their copper phone wires, aiming ultimately to compete with cable and satellite providers. Asher was placed in charge of producing original programming for the service, an \\"unenviable task\\", said Tele-TV chairman-CEO Howard Stringer. However, Tele-TV failed in 1997 because of conflicts between the partner phone companies and technical difficulties regarding national co-ordination and distribution. Following this, Asher wrote for the MTV animated series Downtown in 1999 and edited stories for Roughnecks: Starship Troopers Chronicles during the same year. He wrote for the computer-animated series Pet Alien in 2005 and for the documentary film Koryo Saram ‚Äì the Unreliable People two years later. Having relocated back to England, he joined the BBC in the late 2000s as the executive producer for interactive at CBBC, the organisation's children's strand. With Asher working as one of its executive producers, the CBBC show Big Babies was nominated for a British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) Children's Award in 2010 as one of the best comedies.

Summary Keegan discusses early warfare, the proliferation of Bronze Age warfare and then Iron Age warfare (Greek hoplites and phalanxes, Roman legions and maniples). He also talks about the conquests of the \\"horse peoples\\", first under the Assyrians, then the Achaemenids, Parthians and Sassanids; then in the 7th century the Arabs conquer a lot of territory, followed by the Mongols under Genghis Khan and finally the last of the horse peoples under a Mongol named Tamerlane, who unleashes massive carnage and destruction. The rise of medieval Europe causes the raising of money for castles, with infantry being paid to dig under castles for their destruction. Western Europe perfects castles that are impregnable. At the same time, cavalry is gradually eliminated from the battlefield; matchlocks, flintlocks and eventually Smith & Wesson revolvers become dominant (they help Japan win the Russo-Japanese War). In World War I, mustard gas, grenades, artillery and guns kill a massive number of soldiers that are buried in muddy graveyards on the Western Front. In World War II, millions die on the Eastern Front because of Adolf Hitler's theories of living space (Lebensraum) Keegan takes issue with Carl von Clausewitz's idea that war is an extension of politics, implying that war is carried on in a rational way under the conscious control of politicians. Rather he sees the existence of armies and warriors as distorting the nature of politics and of culture, sometimes becoming the dominant cultural form and that war itself is ultimately a disastrous and irrational outcome of a failure of politics and diplomacy. His book is less concerned with the technology and lists of battles as underlying motivations and social anthropology. Keegan dedicates his book to an ancestor, a Lieutenant Bridgman in the R√©giment de Clare, one of the Wild Geese mercenaries of the French Army, who was killed at the Battle of Lauffeld in 1747. Reception In a review in Foreign Affairs, Eliot A. Cohen wrote, \\"Despite some graceful writing and pointed observations, A History of Warfare fails to live up to the title's promise or the author's reputation\\". Cohen described it as \\"a vendetta against a liberal German soldier-theorist of the early nineteenth century [Clausewitz]\\".

It was his fourth studio album and the third with Musica Studios. Recording After the failure of Percik Pesona (Stain of Enchantment; 1979), Chrisye decided to distance himself from the pure pop sound that had made the earlier albums Badai Pasti Berlalu (The Storm Will Surely Pass; 1977) and Sabda Alam (Nature's Order; 1978) successful. After a period of introspection and contemplation, he decided to stick with pop, but give it a romantic theme with easy listening influences. Guruh Soekarnoputra, songwriter son of former president Sukarno, contributed significantly to the project; he wrote the lyrics for all the songs except \\"To My Friends on Legian Beach\\" and \\"Gita Cinta\\" (\\"Love Song\\"), as well as all the melodies except \\"Interlude - Kenang-Kenangan\\" (\\"Interlude - Memories\\"). For \\"To My Friends on Legian Beach\\", Indonesian poet Sitor Situmorang wrote the lyrics, while Eddy Iskandar handled the lyrics for \\"Gita Cinta\\". The melody for \\"Interlude - Kenang-Kenangan\\" was written by long-term collaborator Jockie Soerjoprajogo. Musically, Yockie played the keyboard and harmonica, while Chrisye played the bass and guitar, both electric and acoustic. Roesma of Musica Studios served as recording engineer during the recording sessions in Jakarta. Release and reception Prior to the album's release, two of its singles, \\"Galih dan Ratna\\" (\\"Galih and Ratna\\") and \\"Gita Cinta\\" (\\"Love Song\\") were selected for inclusion in the 1979 film Gita Cinta dari SMA (Love Song in High School). For marketing, Chrisye took a cameo role in the film as the singer of \\"Galih dan Ratna\\". Puspa Indah was released by Musica Studios in mid-1980, with high sales. The success of Puspa Indah convinced Chrisye that some albums needed to be synergized with other media in order to succeed. Puspa Indah has been reissued twice, once as a CD in 2004 and once as part of the Chrisye Masterpiece Trilogy Limited Edition in 2007.

He was born in London in 1906, and emigrated to New Zealand in 1925. He went on to become a commercial artist at a Wellington advertising agency, and in 1932 became a freelance artist. His work included book covers and illustrations, but is most famous for more than 1,000 stamp, coin and medal designs.Berry, Reginald George James, Biography at The Encyclopedia of New Zealand. Berry's first successful stamp design was for New Zealand's 1933 health stamp. For the next 20 years he designed a vast majority of the stamps issued by New Zealand. Increasing numbers of stamp issues meant that more artists were subsequently employed, but Berry continued designing stamps into the 1970s. Berry also designed stamps for Western Samoa, the Cook Islands, Niue, Tonga, and Bermuda. After a lengthy process, Berry was the artist for the final designs selected for New Zealand's decimal coins,James Berry and New Zealand's 1967 Decimal Coins, Reserve Bank of New Zealand. introduced in 1967 in denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 and 50 cents.

Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek, Copenhagen Print of the execution of Maximilian in Santiago de Quer√©taro, Mexico. The Execution of Emperor Maximilian is a series of paintings by √âdouard Manet from 1867 to 1869, depicting the execution by firing squad of Emperor Maximilian I of the short-lived Second Mexican Empire. Manet produced three large oil paintings, a smaller oil sketch and a lithograph of the same subject. All five works were brought together for an exhibition in London and Mannheim in 1992‚Äì1993 and at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 2006. History Maximilian was born in 1832, the son of Archduke Franz Karl of Austria and Princess Sophie of Bavaria. After a career in the Austrian Navy, he was encouraged by Napoleon III to become Emperor of Mexico following the French intervention in Mexico. Maximilian arrived in Mexico in May 1864. He faced significant opposition from forces loyal to the deposed president Benito Ju√°rez throughout his reign, and the Empire collapsed after Napoleon withdrew French troops in 1866. Maximilian was captured in May 1867, sentenced to death at a court martial, and executed, together with Generals Miguel Miram√≥n and Tom√°s Mej√≠a, on 19 June 1867. Manet supported the Republican cause, particularly as represented by L√©on Gambetta, but was inspired to start work on a painting, heavily influenced by Goya's The Third of May 1808. The final work, painted in 1868‚Äì1869 is now held by the Kunsthalle Mannheim. The painting is signed by Manet in the lower left corner but bears the date of Maximilian's execution in 1867, despite being painted in 1868‚Äì1869. Fragments of an earlier and larger painting from about 1867‚Äì1868 are held by the National Gallery in London. Parts of that work were probably cut off by Manet, but it was largely complete on his death. Other parts were sold separately after his death. The surviving pieces were reassembled by Edgar Degas and they were bought by the National Gallery in 1918, then separated again until 1979, and finally combined on one canvas in 1992. A third, unfinished, oil painting is held by the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, donated from Mr. and Mrs. Frank Gair Macomber in 1930, who bought it from Ambroise Vollard in 1909. A much smaller work in oils, the study for the Mannheim painting is held by the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek in Copenhagen. Manet was refused permission to reproduce the lithograph in 1869, but an edition of 50 impressions was produced in 1884, after his death. Examples of the lithograph are held by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and the Clark Art Institute in Williamstown, Massachusetts. In the Boston version of the painting, the soldiers wear clothes and sombrero of Mexican Republicans. In the final version in Mannheim, they are dressed in 19th-century field dress, common to many armies at that time, but Manet recognized the irony that they could be easily mistaken for French soldiers in this picture. The sergeant wearing a red cap clearly resembles Napoleon III (in reality, the execution was bungled, and a coup de gr√¢ce was required). Political sensitivities made it impossible for Manet to exhibit his paintings in France during the reign of Napoleon III, but the Mannheim version was exhibited in New York and Boston in 1879‚Äì1880, brought there by Manet's friend, the opera singer √âmilie Ambre.Tinterow, Gary and Lacambre, Genevi√®ve (2003).

It opened in 1990 as a replacement for the historic Lake Shore Drive Bridge that runs parallel to it. History Construction on the bridge began in 1988. The quantity of wood used was equivalent to three or four average-size houses. The bridge opened for highway M-26 traffic in 1990, at which point the neighboring Lake Shore Drive Bridge was restricted to pedestrian use. On August 26, 1992, the bridge was entered into the 1992 Timber Bridge Design and Construction Award Competition. It was awarded first place in the \\"Long Span Vehicular Bridges\\" category. Design The bridge is primarily constructed of wood joined together with steel connectors. It is supported by two adjacent arches: one spans and the other . Each arch is constructed from two curved sections joined together by a crown hinge. The road deck is made of wood and covered by an asphalt road surface. All the timber members were structural glued laminated and pressure treated with preservative pentachlorophenol in oil. Any wooden portions which were cut or drilled also had an application of copper naphthenate. The steel pins in the hinges at the crown and abutments were chrome plated to reduce friction and prevent corrosion. All other steel was hot-dipped galvanized, given a tie-coat, and covered by epoxy and a top coat of brown urethane, a system designed to provide thirty years of protection.. The engineered timber members were manufactured in Peshtigo, Wisconsin by Sentinel Structures, Inc. Bridge maintenance consists of reapplying preservative to all wooden members and any necessary tightening of bolts.

Biography Ca√±edo was born in Mexico City as Alejandro de Ca√±edo; his father was a Mexican government official and his mother was from the United States. In 1918, when Ca√±edo was 15, his parents sent him to √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris where he studied under the sculptor Jean Magrou. In 1923, Ca√±edo traveled to Rome where he continued his art studies. In 1927, Ca√±edo briefly returned to Mexico. During that trip, the Mexican Government appointed him attach√© to the Mexican Embassy in Rome. In 1928, Ca√±edo held his first art exhibition with the Circolo Artistico in Rome, a collection of pencil drawings. More exhibitions followed in other cities in Europe. That same year, he traveled to the New York City where he exhibited widely. At this point, he began signing his work with just his last name; eventually, he also Anglicized his first name as \\"Alexander\\" and dropped the \\"de\\". Ca√±edo was commissioned in 1929 to illustrate the amatory novel Orientale: The Adventure of Therese Beauchamps by the French author Francis de Miomandre. The highly stylized Art Deco results were so successful that he retained Ca√±edo the following year to illustrate his next novel, The Love Life of Venus. In 1932, Ca√±edo was invited to have a solo show of his pencil drawings at Walter P. Chrysler, Junior's newly opened Cheshire Gallery, located in the Chrysler Building. He also had a solo exhibition at the Argent Galleries, and participated in shows of the Art Students League of New York, of which he was an active member. By the mid-1930s, Ca√±edo began exhibiting watercolors. These were shown at solo exhibitions at the Arthur U. Newton Galleries. He expanded to work in oil paint and in the early 1940s, such work was exhibited at the Arthur U. Newton Galleries and the Schneider-Gabriel Galleries of New York. Beginning in 1947 and over the next decade, he produced many illustrations for the covers of science fiction magazines such as Astounding. Traveling west, Ca√±edo held a solo show at Gump's Gallery in San Francisco in 1949, the first of many exhibitions at Gump's. That year, he also exhibited at the first annual Art League of California faculty show. In 1950, Walter Foster published an art instruction book titled How Ca√±edo Draws the Figure; it remained in print for five years. Ca√±edo permanently relocated to California, dividing his time between San Francisco and Los Angeles, with frequent painting trips to the Monterey area. His work tended to be formally similar, with nude figures set in improbable, alien or abstracted landscapes, or featured natural objects such as seashells floating in such settings. During this time, Ca√±edo also produced many overtly homoerotic artworks for private collectors which were too suggestive to be exhibited in galleries. His work remained in demand throughout the 1960s, with solo exhibitions at the James Pendleton Gallery, Galleria Gianni, Raymond & Raymond Gallery and the Arcade Gallery in the Beverly Hills Hotel. His works are included in the permanent collection of the Leslie Lohman Gay Art Foundation. Ca√±edo died in West Hollywood, California on February 1, 1978.

In eighth grade Bowman's choir teacher took notice and gave Bowman her first solo performance. After graduating from high school, Bowman began going to New York City meeting with producers, auditioning for production companies and girl groups. She started working with a producer in New York and began writing and recording original music at the age of 18. Music career At the age of 18, Bowman was commuting to New York City writing and recording her music. Composer David Wolfert, working a few doors down from the studio, overheard one of Bowman's tracks. Wolfert, at that time, was looking for a female singer for Diamond & Pearl: Galactic Battles, the twelfth season of the Pok√©mon animated series, and approached Bowman. She agreed to sing the opening theme song, \\"Battle Cry (Stand Up!)\\"\\" along with \\"Black and White\\" for Pok√©mon: Black & White, and \\"I Believe in You\\" for Zoroark: Master of Illusions. These Pok√©mon episodes are aired regularly on national TV through Cartoon Network.

Bowman's second single, \\"King Boy\\", was released in June 2013 and became the fifth most played song on Sirius XM's 20 on 20 for the year. The success of \\"King Boy\\" led to recording with many producers in 2014, and in the spring she released \\"Hey Summer\\", which made a major impact in a number of local markets. In the fall, Bowman co-wrote and recorded \\"Keep Me Warm\\", which was picked up by McDonald's for their McCafe White Chocolate Mocha TV commercialhttp://www.ispot.tv/ad/7uEF/mcdonalds-mccaf-white-chocolate-warm-up- to-winter that first aired on the 7th game of the World Series, and continued to run on national TV for the remainder of the year and received airplay on 3 radio formats: AC (Adult Contemporary), Hot AC, and Top 40.

He became an important Plains Ojibway leader in the 1860s and may have participated in the short 1869-1870 Red River Rebellion. After the short conflict ended, the whites knew they had to negotiate with chief Yellow Quill whose Ojibway name is pronounced as O-zah-wah-sko-gwan-na-be which really means Blue Quill and Green Quill.  The Portage Band  O-zah-wah-sko-gwan-na-be was the leader of the Plains Ojibways known as the Portage Band. A dispute arose among the Portage Band after a legitimate heir to a families powerful position took control of those Ojibways after he became of age. In order to avoid civil strife chief Yellow Quill promptly took action. He signed treaty 1 which established three First Nations for the Portage Band in southern Manitoba. They are the Long Plain, Sandy Bay, and Swan Lake First Nations of southern Manitoba. O-zah-wah-sko- gwan-na-be knew the dispute would only benefit the whites so he commenced an Ojibway exodus into Saskatchewan.

Among them were chief O-zah-wah-sko-gwan-na-be and his councilor (headman) chief Kinistin. They commenced an exodus into the Qu' Appelle Valley of Saskatchewan. The whites did not like it. They had to negotiate with chief O-zah-wah-sko-gwan-na-be once again. Chief Yellow Quill signed an adhesion to treaty 4 which established the Fishing Lake and Nut Lake First Nations of Saskatchewan. However, chief O-zah-wah-sko-gwan-na-be was very aware of the discontent many of the Plains Ojibways of Manitoba and Saskatchewan were feeling and probably instructed Chief Kinistin to commence yet another Ojibway exodus to the north and probably the west. There is a First Nation in Alberta known as the Blue Quill First Nation after all which is shared by several Alberta First Nations. In 1885, chief Kinistin commenced the Ojibway exodus north into the caribou country of the Dene. That be well north of present-day Prince Albert, Saskatchewan and Flin Flon, Manitoba.  Later life  Chief Yellow Quill did not settle down to live permanently in Saskatchewan. He returned to live out the remainder of his life in his native land. He settled down to live on the Swan Lake First Nation of southern Manitoba. He died there in 1910 of natural causes. In 1989, the Nut Lake First Nation changed their name to the Yellow Quill First Nation.

Background \\"Kinistin\\" or Kini≈°tin (meaning \\"Cree\\") came to Saskatchewan from Western Ontario along with his two brothers, Miskokwanep (\\"Red [Crow-]Feather\\") and MehcihcƒÅkanihs (\\"Coyote\\"). Chief Kinistin possibly participated in the 1869-1870 Red River Rebellion. Exodus into Saskatchewan During the Treaty 1 negotiations, Yellow Quill and Kinistin agreed to the treaty terms but a dispute arose among the Plains Ojibway of southern Manitoba which led Yellow Quill and other Ojibway chiefs including Kinistin, to commence an exodus into Saskatchewan in the 1870s. They settled in the Qu'Appelle River valley. An agreement to observe to Treaty 4 was signed on August 24, 1876, at Fort Pelly, which established the Nut Lake Band. Further exodus to the north During the 1880s, amid unrest among the Plains Ojibway over whether to maintain traditional way of life, Kinistin broke from Yellow Quill and camped in the parkland of the Barrier River district. Uprooting his people again in 1885 to avoid the North-West Rebellion, he moved north into the caribou country of the Dene. After searching for good hunting grounds not claimed by other larger tribes, Kinistin and his people resided in the Pasquia Hills of northeastern Saskatchewan, well north of what is now Prince Albert and Flin Flon, Manitoba. Following Riel‚Äôs defeat, Kinistin returned to Barrier River to choose a reserve. In February 1890 he sent for Reginald Beatty, extracting a promise to aid him in securing a reserve along the Barrier River/ The two secured reserve areas that became the base for the present Kinistin Saulteaux Nation in 1900. Descendants The Ojibway descendants of Kinistin's subjects live on the Hatchet Lake First Nation, Lac La Ronge First Nation, and the Peter Ballantyne First Nation of Manitoba and the Barren Lands First Nation, Mathias Colomb First Nation, Marcel Colomb First Nation, and the Northlands First Nation of Manitoba.

The film is a remake of the Tamil movie Budget Padmanabhan (2000).Budget Padmanabhan Plot Padmanabham (Jagapati Babu) is a miser who does anything to save money, because when he was a young boy, Padmanabham was driven out of his house along with his parents by an evil-hearted money lender (Tanikella Bharani), who gave him a condition: if by a stipulated time period, Padmanabham could raise enough money to buy back the house he could reclaim it as his own. Ramya (Ramya Krishna) not only likes him, she also falls deeply in love with him. Padmanabham doesn't want to do anything with her, but when Ramya suggests that two salaries are better than one, he thinks it's a brilliant idea and marries her. Now the troubles start: first, his sister Vijaya (Y. Vijaya) and her husband Totti Subramanyam (L. B. Sriram) pile on to him and then Ramya's good-for-nothing brother Ravi (Ravi Teja) also seeks shelter in their house. The worst, though, is yet to come for the grumbling Padmanabham: his wife gives birth to triplets, who all live together in a small house. In a sub-plot, Padmanabham hires a housemaid Sonali (Vidya), who gets pregnant after some time, everyone suspects Padmanabham, but the situation turns out to be stranger, actually the truth is, Sonali is Padmanabhan boss son Anil's (Anil) separated wife. Finally, Padmanabham raises the money and reclaims his house back and even Ramya also realizes her mistake after knowing the truth from Anil. At the end of the film, Sonali also gives birth to triplets in the hospital. Cast * Jagapati Babu as Padmanabham * Ramyakrishna as Ramya * Ravi Teja as Ravi * L. B.

The system was first identified as an area of low pressure over the Andaman Sea on December 15\\\\. Following interaction with a tropical wave, it began to develop and became a depression by December 18\\\\. Increasingly rapid intensification ensued over the following days with the cyclone attaining hurricane-force winds around 5¬∞N the next day. Early on December 23, the storm struck Norther Ceylon and India's Pamban Island with winds estimated at 240 km/h (150 mph), ranking it as a modern-day super cyclonic storm. Weakening somewhat, the storm soon struck Tamil Nadu. Rapid weakening followed once the cyclone was onshore and it degenerated into a depression on December 24 as it emerged over the Arabian Sea. The system later dissipated on December 26 over open water. Meteorological history On December 15, 1964, an area of low pressure was identified over the southern Andaman Sea. Remaining nearly stationary, a tropical wave soon interacted with the low and allowed the system to consolidate into a depression two days later. A large area of showers and thunderstorms covered much of the southern Bay of Bengal and Andaman Sea. On December 18, a ship with the callsign JMAG reported 45 km/h (30 mph) winds and a barometric pressure of 1005.5 mbar (hPa; 29.70 inHg). Based on this report, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) classified the system as a deep depression. Over the following days, the system quickly intensified as it began moving slowly westward. By December 19, it became a severe cyclonic storm and soon acquired hurricane-force winds early on December 20 while near 5¬∞N. The cyclone became one of only a handful of system to attain such an intensity close to the equator. Moving more west- northwesterly, the cyclone continued to deepen as it approached southern India. On December 21, satellite imagery showed clouds from the storm covering an area roughly 965 km (600 mi) wide. Several prominent banding features were present, with one such feature, extending over 240 km (150 mi) crossing the equator while maintaining a cyclonic arc. Clouds associated with the cyclone extended as far as 485 km (300 mi) into the Southern Hemisphere. Several vessels encountered the storm, with one reporting 110 km/h (70 mph) winds early on December 22\\\\. That day winds along the coast of Ceylon increased; the storm accelerated during this time as well. Early on December 23, the cyclone struck the northern tip of Ceylon and turned back toward the west-northwest. According to an officer on Pamban Island, located between Ceylon and Southern India, the storm's eye was no more than 16 km (10 mi) wide. Based on satellite imagery, it was estimated that the storm had peak winds of 240 km/h (150 mph), with gusts as high as 280 km/h (175 mph). This ranked the system as a modern- day super cyclonic storm. Additionally, the IMD estimated its central pressure to have been, at most, 970 mbar (hPa; 28.64 inHg). The lowest observed pressure was 978 mb (hPa; 28.88 inHg) in Mannar on the west coast of Ceylon. Weakening somewhat, the storm soon struck Tamil Nadu, south of Tondi. Once onshore, the cyclone rapidly weakened, becoming a depression before emerging over the Arabian Sea on December 24\\\\. The system degenerated into a remnant low later that day and dissipated over open waters on December 26.  Impact  At least 1,800 people lost their lives as a result of the cyclone. On December 22, the powerful cyclone struck northern areas of Ceylon and caused catastrophic damage. According to survivors, a storm surge of swept across the area. Initial reports stated that 250 people lost their lives with thousands missing. About 5000 houses and 700 fishing boats were destroyed in the Jaffna district of Ceylon. The district's paddy crop was also destroyed. Other badly hit areas include Mannar and Trincomallee. The Trincomallee port suffered severe damage rendering it inoperable. The economic damage caused in Ceylon was estimated at Rs. 200 million. About 350 Ceylonese fishermen were missing at sea. At least 1,000 people were killed on the island and many more were left unaccounted for. An unofficial estimate stated that the death toll would likely exceed 2,000. The government regarded it as, \\"the greatest tragedy to ever hit Ceylon.\\" Remains of a church in Dhanushkodi in 2007 The effects of the cyclone were felt mostly in Pamban Island, which lies between the Indian mainland and Ceylon. More than 3000 people, many of them tourists and pilgrims, were stranded on the island. The total damage to property was estimated at $150 million. On December 23, an estimated storm surge struck the town of Dhanuskodi on the south-eastern edge of the island, submerging the town and overturning the Pamban-Dhanuskodi passenger train killing all 200 passengers on board. The town, an important transit point between India and Ceylon, was completely destroyed and has not been rebuilt since. Prior to the cyclone, the town had been an important commercial centre with a railway station, a customs office, post and telegraphs office, two medical institutions, one railway hospital, a panchayat union dispensary, a higher elementary school and port offices. A port had been functioning since 1 March 1914. At least 800 people were killed in Dhanushkodi alone. Four radio operators remained in Dhanuskodi and risked their lives to continue broadcasting during the storm. They were ultimately caught up in the storm surge but survived by clinging to the Pamban Bridge for 12 hours. The government later honored and rewarded them for their dedication. Aftermath The scale of the disaster left villages isolated for at least three days and without food or clean water. Communication lines were severely damaged and hampered relief efforts. By December 26, relief supplies were delivered to 14 villages by the Ceylonese Air Force. Britain, Cuba, West Germany, and the United States offered aid to Ceylon. Reconstruction of the Pamban Bridge was deemed a priority and initially expected to take six months to complete. However E. Sreedharan, an engineer tasked on the project, managed to have the railway bridge finished in 45 days. A stable road connection was built in the following years. In Mandapam, the cyclone's surge created five tidal pools over a stretch of coastline. Three of the pools had higher than normal salinity coupled with below-average silicate content and were colonized by Peridinium. The other two featured opposite levels of salinity and silicate and were inhabited by Pyrocystis fusiformis. All five featured bioluminescence as a result. A study of these pools in 1965 showed a, \\"clear succession of organisms,\\" with species of Penaeidae (Prawn), one species of amphipoda, one species of crab, and Acetes inhabiting the pools. Researchers also found a few Sepioteuthis and tintinnid. Lastly, 46 species of coastal fish were documented. Offshore, catastrophic damage occurred to coral reefs, with Echinopora lamellosa, Montipora foliosa, and alcyonarians being killed in large numbers. At Manacadu Point, near Mandapam, an elevated coral colony of Faviids and Porites was completely wiped out. In the eight years following the storm, colonies showed substantial growth across the Palk Strait, with Acropora corymbosa covering 25‚Äì30% of the reefs. Colonies of alcyonarians showed little sign of rejuvenation, however. Along the immediate coastline, the large-scale stirring of sand made areas unsuitable for coral and were not expected to ever regrow.

Some Kosraean variants name this hero Nanparatak, with features closer to Ulithian tales of the same archetype. He is considered the father of modern Pohnpei. There is great variation among sources for the exact events before and during the invasion on Pohnpei; there at least 13 differing accounts of the war published. In most versions of the Isokelekel legend, the Saudeleur rule had become oppressive under its abusive centralized social system, and its lords had offended the Thunder God Nan Sapwe, sealing the fate of the dynasty. Pohnpeian culture is heavily autonomous and decentralized, and quibbling directly and publicly over variations is considered bad form. The differences among the many accounts are further attributed to a wide range of cultural phenomena, from kava social groups to clan affiliation. Accordingly, any preferred version is generally the product of a measure of self-interest and autonomy. Modern chiefs of Pohnpei trace their lineage to Isokelekel, and according to this legend, modern Pohnpeians are descendants of Isokelekel's invasion party. Origins According to most versions of Isokelekel's legendary birth, his father is the Thunder God Nan Sapwe. Nan Sapwe had committed adultery with the wife of the Saudeleur lord. In anger, the Saudeleur lord set out to capture Nan Sapwe. Some versions include that the ruler had also incensed other gods of the Pohnpeian pantheon and insulted a high priest who prophesied the Saudeleur downfall. These offenses, as well as the oppressive land ownership and tribute system of the Saudeleur, drew the ire of gods, humans, and animals alike. Nan Sapwe, offended by the Saudeleur lord, left Pohnpei for Kosrae. Certain versions indicate the Thunder God fled to the sky world of East Katau. Having fled, he impregnated a barren human of his own Dipwenpahnmei (Under-the-breadfruit-tree) clan named Lipahnmei by feeding her a lime. This incestuous union produced the semi-divine Isokelekel, who in the womb knew his destiny of vengeance. Several extremely variant versions omit Isokelekel's divine paternity altogether, focusing on a lapse of cultural norms on the part of the Saudeleur in failing to provide food to Isokelekel when he arrives. In these versions, he is sometimes even accorded native Pohnpeian origins, and avenges the death of his brother, as opposed to the shame of his godly father. In other versions, Isokelekel is the product of a youth deified by the Thunder God and a Dipwenpahnmei human, or a pair of brothers avenging the murder of their father by the Saudeleur. Despite that Isokelekel's father was usually regarded as a Pohnpeian deity, Isokelekel was decidedly foreign. He is described in legend as dark-skinned, and \\"savage.\\" Brown (1907) posits that Isokelekel was perhaps of Papuasian descent. His origins are often described as southern, or \\"downwind.\\" In certain variations, Isokelekel first happens upon Pohnpei while fishing, and in some he is scared off by the massive settlements, returning later to conquer the island. Invasion of Pohnpei Municipality map of Pohnpei Nan Madol complex Nan Madol shoreline view Nan Madol interior entrance As an adult, Isokelekel set sail with 333 men, women, and children with the secret intention of conquering Pohnpei. The embarkment was consecrated by human sacrifice, a ritual widespread in Polynesian culture, but altogether rare in Pohnpeian history. According to tradition, Isokelekel stopped in several places throughout the eastern Caroline Islands en route to Pohnpei, including Ant Atoll near Kitti, Losap in the Mortlocks, and Pingelap. According to some versions, it is on Ant Atoll that Isokelekel learns from his mother, a bird, an elderly lover, or by divination that his mission is to conquer Pohnpei. The canoe of invaders first entered Pohnpeian territory through a channel near Kehpara, a reef island near Kitti. From Kitti, Isokelekel circumnavigated Pohnpei in a clockwise direction, a theme of Pohnpeian mythology. Isokelekel stopped in Palikir, where he was offered leftover lihli (breadfruit pudding), a gesture forbidden toward high-ranking persons, earning Pohnpei the moniker Sapwen luh Pohnpei (Land of Leftovers Pohnpei). On his way to Nan Madol, Isokelekel received breadfruit kernels from the chief of Ant Atoll. In their culture, breadfruit kernels were the meal of warriors about to battle, and the offering constituted an invitation to do battle with the Saudeleur. While on Ant Island, Isokelekel entered a romantic relationship with a native woman named Likamadau (\\"Woman Who Gives Thought\\"), demonstrating his intention to cultivate close ties with Pohnpeians and oppose only the Saudeleur. Minor localized versions of the Isokelekel myth include that the invasion party sailed past certain areas because local gods protected them. At Nahrihnnahnsapwe, a small reef island near Nan Madol, Isokelekel performed rites to reaffirm his intent to conquer Pohnpei. The invasion party waited for an invitation to enter at Ewenkep, a break in the reef near Mall Islet south of Nanmadol. The Saudeleur lord Saudemwohl was unaware the son of the Thunder God was aboard, however he sent a fleet to welcome the visitors, receiving them as guests at Kalapuel, Nan Madol, offshore of the main island of Pohnpei. According to many versions, war broke out at Nan Madol after playing between local children and those from Isokelekel's canoe escalated into a fight. In another version, Isokelekel had his lieutenant provoke a local warrior at a prearranged encounter. Other accounts hold that Isokelekel staged an insurrection after winning the trust of his hosts, and with help from the oppressed locals. Another says that upon seeing the fortifications at Nan Madol, Isokelekel decided to withdraw, but was aided by a scorned and outcast woman from the ruling Saudeleur family. In some versions, Isokelekel's warriors are aided by hidden weapons that suddenly appeared. One prominent event during the war was the throwing of a spear through the foot of Isokelekel's lieutenant during his retreat, however the thrower and the identity of the lieutenant vary among versions of the legend. Some state the lieutenant, named Nahnparadak or Nahnapas, drove his own spear into his foot to anchor it amid the retreat to rally the invaders. Others say Isokelekel himself threw the spear. The tide of war reversed several times, but ended against the Saudeleur, who retreated with his army into the main island of Pohnpei. In some versions, Isokelekel lost an eye in his conquest of Nan Madol. As the Saudeleur lord retreated, his lieutenant cast a stone at Isokelekel, blinding and maiming him. Later, in admiration of his skill and gall, Isokelekel made this warrior his own general, whose descendants today hold places of honor in ceremonial feasts beside Isokelekel's own descendants. Most versions of the Isokelekel myth include a character called Lepen Moar, aide to the Saudeleur, though there is no consensus on his role. He variously fails to provide food to Isokelekel's party, leading to war; or leads the Saudeleur army to initially route the invasion; or was in fact the lieutenant who threw the stone striking Isokelekel. Legend recounts that the battle ended as Saudeleur lord Saudemwohl retreated ever uphill to a stream, where he transformed into a fish and remains today. Petersen (1990) presents an alternative analysis of the Isokelekel myth under which the historical leader invaded not Pohnpei, but only the region Madolenihmw. This, in turn, fed into the politically decentralized oral legends behind Nan Madol. Reign Isokelekel resided with his family at Nan Madol on Temwen Island, though his capital was Madolenihmw. He was variously described as seizing the reign of the Saudeleur, and as gaining the consensus of the elite in his installation as the first nahnmwarki. Isokelekel divided the Pohnpei into three autonomous chiefdoms based on preexisting divisions; this number later grew to five. He summoned the elite of Pohnpei and surrounding islands to gather, to whom he announced a welcome regime change, and with whom he consulted in creating a new decentralized Pohnpeian political system. Some mythological versions include divine inspiration by the god Luhk, who brought the three vanquished chiefs into a hovering canoe. Although the political system was greatly decentralized from Saudeleur times, many of the methods of paying tribute to higher classes went unchanged: the uhpa (service) and nopwei (first fruits) payments of the Saudeleur era remained customary, and religious institutions such as nah continued to develop. Sokehs, a prestigious region of Pohnpei under Saudeleur reign, was largely stripped of its might. At Pahn Akuwalap, Isokelekel instituted a new political order, the sacred nahnmwarki, lesser nahnken, and priestly title system that remains in modern use on Pohnpei. Overall, his reign is characterized in legend as gentle. His supreme titles included Wasa Lapalap at Madolenihmw, Sangoro at Uh, Pwoudo at Nett, and Iso Eni at Sokehs. While the nahnken were also sacred, the nahnmwarki in particular was sacrosanct and subject to several taboos. Nahnmwarki were forbidden to appear in public, and communicated to commoners through the nahnken. This served to protect the sacrosanct nature of the ruler and to protect against abuse of authority. Nahnmwarki and nahnken families intermarried, and with the exception of the son of Isokelekel, the ruling title passed matrilineally. Generally, men were encouraged to marry daughters of their paternal aunts (their first cousins). During his reign, Isokelekel and his party married and assimilated as much as possible into Pohnpeian society, however semi-divine Isokelekel remained above many strict taboos, taking his own sister as a wife. At one point, he instructed one of his pregnant Pohnpeian wives to kill the infant if she bore a male. She gave birth in his absence, and instead of following his instructions, she hid her son Nahnlepenien with an elderly couple. Isokelekel met his son as an adult; Nahnlepenien was recognized as special because of his flagrant casualness with divine Isokelekel and breaking other strict taboos. Isokelekel decided to spare his son because he grew fond of him. From here, the origin of the nahnken also has a mythical basis: Nahnlepenien broke Pohnpeian customs and taboos, including the incest taboo with Isokelekel's eldest sister, a motherly figure in the culture. Isokelekel was loath to punish his own son, and spared him physical punishment. Instead, he created the title of nahnkan, a lesser rank than nahnmwarki, for his son. Death At Peikapw, a place of prayer, Isokelekel saw his reflection in a pool of water and, realizing his old age, decided to commit suicide. According to one legend, he tied his penis to the top of a young palm tree. Letting go of the bent tree, his penis was torn off, and Isokelekel bled to death. The remains of Isokelekel are believed to be within a large mortuary on Temwen Island. However, some believe the tomb is but a decoy, and that the hero was buried at sea. Nonetheless, the tomb is a sacred site. In 1907, when German governor Berg insisted on excavating the crypt, he died of sunstroke, confirming among locals the power of its relics. The tomb was again excavated in 1928 by the Japanese, who found bones larger than those of modern Pohnpeians. Legacy Today, Isokelekel is regarded as a cultural hero on both Kosrae and Pohnpei. He has left many chiefly claimants of descent on modern Pohnpei, including over 22 generations of reigning nahnmwarki descendants. Modern chiefs of Pohnpei trace their lineage to Isokelekel, though local nahnken chiefs have come to hold title in dual blood lines. The association of Isokelekel with invincibility is such that a Kosraean uttering the name to a Pohnpeian amounts to an undisguised challenge. Petersen (1995) identifies a cultural theme of caution within the Isokelekel myth in relations with foreign powers, modernly applicable to the United States. Petersen (1990) also comments that \\"initiation of important events in Pohnpei mythology is often ascribed to outsiders,\\" the prime example being Isokelekel and the Saudeleur. The legend of Isokelekel is also used to explain the apparently mixed racial makeup of Pohnpei against its Micronesian background. Isokelekel's party thoroughly settled the eastern, most populous areas of Pohnpei, from which their relations diffused.

Eleanor also won the 1801 Epsom Oaks among many other races before retiring from racing at age eight to become a broodmare for Bunbury. She produced the stallion Muley, which in turn sired the mare Marpessa (dam of Pocahontas and grandam of Stockwell) and the influential stallion Leviathan which was exported to the United States in the early nineteenth century. Through the produce of her daughter Active (the grandam of Woodburn), Eleanor is present in the pedigrees of 19th-century American Standardbred racehorses. Background Eleanor was foaled in 1798 at Barton Hall near Bury St. Edmunds, the ancestral home of her breeder Charles Bunbury. She was a bay filly with a small white star and a sock on her left hind foot. Bunbury purchased Eleanor's sire Whiskey in 1793 after his racing career. Whiskey was foaled in 1789 and was bred by the Prince of Wales. He won several sweepstakes over his racing career and raced until he was four years old. Her dam, Young Giantess (foaled in 1790), was sired by Diomed, the winner of the first Epsom Derby and also owned by Bunbury, out of the mare Giantess. Giantess (foaled in 1769) was bred by Viscount Bolingbroke and had raced with success prior to being purchased as a broodmare by Bunbury, winning three races in eight starts. Young Giantess raced a few times, but was not successful on the turf. Retired to stud in 1794, Young Giantess was an exceptional broodmare and produced the influential stallion Sorcerer in 1796 during her first few seasons at stud when bred to Trumpetor. Eleanor was Young Giantess' third foal, and she also produced seven full-siblings to Eleanor: Julia (the dam of 1811 Derby winner Phantom, the sire of Middleton and Cedric), Cressida (the dam of 1830 Derby winner Priam), Lydia (dam of Corporal), Clarissa, Leonardo, Fair Star and Young Whiskey. Young Giantess died in 1811 while attempting to foal twins by Giles. Racing career Eleanor did not race as a two-year-old. She was owned by Charles Bunbury throughout her four-year racing career and won 29 out of her 48 starts. Her training has been attributed to a man named Cox or J. Frost. The death of Cox (or alternatively Frost) is associated with a death-bed anecdote about Eleanor's racing prowess where the dying man exclaims to a clergyman, \\"Depend upon it, that Eleanor is a h‚Äîl of a mare!\\" As a three-year-old in 1801, she became the first filly to win The Derby and also secured The Oaks that year, a feat that would not be repeated until 56 years later when Blink Bonny won both races in 1857. She is the first of only six fillies to win the Epsom Derby, and only four fillies have won the Epsom Oaks and the Derby. Her principal jockey for most of her career was John Saunders. Eleanor retired from racing at age seven and returned to Barton Hall as a broodmare for Bunbury. 1801: three-year-old season Eleanor's trainer (either Cox or Frost; left) with her owner Charles Bunbury and a stable boy in an artist's study by Benjamin Marshall, c. 1801 Eleanor's first race occurred on 20 April in Newmarket at the First Spring meeting where she beat the filly Miss Fuery and won 250 guineas. The Epsom Derby, held on 21 May, was her second career start, which she won against 9 colts and one other filly while carrying 110 pounds. A colt by Fidget (owned by Lord Egremont) was second and the Duke of Grafton's filly Remnant sired by Trumpetor was third. On the day after the Derby, Eleanor won the 550-guinea Epsom Oaks from Lord Grosvenor's filly Rosamond and four other horses. At Ascot, she finished second in a 215-guinea sweepstakes to a colt sired by Asparagus (later named Teddy the Grinder) while carrying 7 pounds more weight than the other racers as a handicap for her wins in the Derby and the Oaks. At the First October meeting in Newmarket, Eleanor won 700 guineas in a match race with Miss Fuery. In her last engagement of the season, Eleanor beat the Duke of Grafton's colt Flambeau in a 200-guinea match race. 1802: four-year-old season In her first start as a four-year-old in spring 1802 at Newmarket, Eleanor finished last in a field of four horses to Lord Darlington's horse Muly-Moloch. At the First October meeting in Newmarket, Eleanor regained her three-year-old form and defeated the mare Penelope, winning 350 guineas. She also won the King's Plate from Sister to Gouty a few days later. At the Second October meeting at Newmarket, her last engagement of the season, Eleanor won ¬£50 in a stakes race by beating the Prince of Wales' horse Shock. 1803: five-year-old season At the Newmarket-Craven meeting, Eleanor received 200 guineas from Mr. Sitwell after his horse Fieldfare forfeited a three-mile match race. At the same meeting Eleanor ran third to Sir Hedworth Williamson's horse Walton in the Oatlands Stakes. At the First Spring meeting in Newmarket, she was second in the King's Plate to Lord Sackville's horse Dick Andrews (later the sire of Eleanor's 1814 filly foal). At Ipswich, Eleanor won ¬£50 in a two-mile race. At Oxford, Eleanor beat her sister Julia to win The Cup and won ¬£50 in three-mile heat races. At Huntingdon she won two ¬£50 races, beating the colt Pipylin in one race. She beat the filly Primrose for the Lincoln King's Plate. She was beaten by Penelope at the Second October meeting at Newmarket in 375-guinea sweepstake race. She ran twice more in 1803 but did not place in either start. 1804: six-year-old season On 2 April at the Newmarket Craven meeting, Eleanor finished third in the Craven Stakes to the mare Aniseed and the colt Walton. She finished second to Penelope for the 100-guinea King's Plate at the First Spring meeting at Newmarket on 17 April. At the same meeting a few days later, Eleanor won the Subscription Handicap Plate of ¬£50, beating Rebel and Chippingham. On 3 May during the Second Spring meeting at Newmarket, Eleanor received 40 guineas from Mr. Mellish after his filly Surprise forfeited a match race. Ten days later at Brocket Hall, Eleanor lost a 100-guinea Gold Cup race to Mr. Dawson's horse Quiz. She won the ¬£50 Town Plate at Ipswich on 5 July against a filly sired by Pot-8-Os. Six days later at the July Meeting at Newmarket, Eleanor won a ¬£50 race against four other younger horses, beating the Duke of Queensberry's three-year-old colt Moorcock. At Chelmsford on 25 July, she won a ¬£50 pound match race against Mr. Golding's three-year-old filly Coaxer. At Huntingdon on 8 August, Eleanor won a match race against the four-year-old filly Capella. On 13 September at Bedford, she received ¬£20 after being the only horse entered in a ¬£50 race (termed as \\"a walk over\\"). Eleanor finished third in a subscription race to Sir Harry Dimsdale and Penelope at the First October meeting at Newmarket. At the same meeting on 4 October, she won an 80-guinea gold cup, beating Virtuosa and Lignum Vitae. At the Second October Meeting at Newmarket, Eleanor beat Orville (later the sire of her 1810 colt Muley) in a 375-guinea subscription race. She was beaten by Mr. Mellish's horse Eagle (full brother to Spread Eagle) in a Halloween match race at the Newmarket-Houghton Meeting. 1805: seven-year-old season Eleanor won three races at the Egham meeting. She beat Miss Coiner for The Cup, won ¬£50 in a race by beating her previous rival Quiz and beat the colt Young Woodpecker for 100 guineas. At the First October meeting at Newmarket, Eleanor beat Lord Foley's colt Czar Peter. At the Second October meeting, she was second to Bustard in a gold cup race. At the Houghton meeting, she was again second in a gold cup race to the horse Stretch. In the last three starts of her career, Eleanor did not place. Stud career Eleanor was retired to stud in 1806 at Bunbury's Barton Hall. Charles Bunbury died in March 1821 and all the horses at Barton Hall were auctioned in the spring of 1822, where Eleanor (listed as \\"Ellinor\\") was sold for just over ¬£91. Eleanor's exact date of death was not reported in the General Stud Book and no foaling entries or breeding attempts are recorded for her after 1823, indicating that she most likely died after foaling in 1823 or in 1824. Full list of offspring Eleanor produced ten foals between 1807 and 1823. Of Eleanor's offspring, her best son was the colt Muley. Muley and Eleanor's other offspring were mediocre racehorses, but Muley and a few of her daughters did produce good racehorses. The General Stud Book lists the breeder of her 1817 colt as Mr. Udny, Sir G. Pigot as the breeder of her 1820 filly and Mr. Rush as the breeder of her last foal in 1823. Her full list of offspring include: Muley: Eleanor's bay 1810 colt sired by Orville and her most notable son. Muley became a successful sire of racehorses and broodmares in the 1820s and 1830s. *Nell (1807), bay filly sired by Johnny. *Chestnut filly (1809) sired by Giles. This filly died before two years old and never raced. *Muley (1810), bay colt sired by Orville. Muley raced only as a five-year-old in 1815, winning two races out of four starts. He was retired to stud at Blickling Hall in 1816 and produced many good racers including Margrave, Vespa and Little Wonder. His most important contribution to Thoroughbred genetics is through his daughter Marpessa (foaled in 1830 out of the mare Clare) whose first foal was the important broodmare Pocahontas, the dam of Stockwell. Muley also produced Leviathan, a leading sire in United States in the early nineteenth century. *Troilus (1811), bay colt sired by Walton. *Black colt (1813) sired by Thunderbolt. *Bay filly (1814) sired by Dick Andrews. This mare was never officially named in England, but did produce Picton in 1819 when bred to the Epsom Derby winner Smolensko and was thereafter colloquially referred to as \\"Picton's dam.\\" Picton was a successful racehorse, winning 14 minor races in his career, but was unsuccessful as a sire. Her 1820 foal, Luzborough, became a significant sire in the United States. She was relocated to France in 1821 and was named Eleonor. She produced seven foals in France and produced the good racer Ganges in 1831 when she was moved back to England. *Barren to Ashton (1815) *Foal (1816) sired by Haphazard. *Bay colt (1817) sired by Haphazard. This colt was sent to India in 1821. *Active (1820), bay filly sired by Partisan. Active was bred to George Pigot and foaled the filly Heads or Tails in 1831. Heads or Tails was exported to the United States in 1839 and became an influential American broodmare, being the grandam of Hester (dam of Springbok) and Woodburn. Woodburn was used primarily as a sire of trotting horses, the basis of the Standardbred breed. *Barren to Merlin (1822). *Aunt Anne (1823), bay filly sired by Pioneer.

It is believed to have been written in the 9th century, and was discovered in a manuscript (on fol. 58r of the Pal. lat. 220 in the Vatican Library, a copy of the Apocalypse of Paul) from the monastery in Lorsch, Germany, famous for the Lorsch Codex.

The Bobcats reached Regional Semifinals in 2005, their third time to go to playoffs in the last four years. They also advanced from district to regional in cross country, where they sent a competitor to the UIL State Cross Country meet. The athletic department is sponsored by the S-T Athletic Booster Club. Skidmore-Tynan has recently hired a new A.D. (Athletic Director), John Livas (more commonly known as Captain Blood).  Powerlifting  Skidmore Tynan's powerlifting program has never been the same since \\"The Big C\\" (powerlifter Cassandra Soto) graduated in 2015. She was the ultimate athlete, being the only member to attend and place at the state meet out of her entire team, including the guys team. She was underappreciated and underfunded but still came out on top. Every athlete respected her as both a person and as an athletic Goddess, with a legend that lives on in the weight room equivalent to that of Beyonce. She will be forever missed by the entire athletic body of Skidmore Tynan. Her love and compassion for the sport will never be matched by any preceding athlete, the closest there will ever be currently lives in the only remaining legacy of \\"The Big C\\" her sister \\"Hurricane Catrina\\" (Catrina Soto) who continues her legend by following in the footsteps of her older sister. The captain of \\"The Big C\\" and \\"Hurricane Catrina\\" fan club, Kalvin Martin, still attends Skidmore Tynan today and works hard to keep the example she expected of the athletes alive and running as well as it was when she was there. It is said if you go into the Skidmore Tynan Bobcat Powerhouse early in the mornings when she used to begin her reps around 4am, you can still hear a silent whisper of chants circling the room, silently all in sync \\"Go Big C! Go Big C! Go Big C!\\" There are few who knew her that still remain at the school today. They rarely grace anyone with the knowledge of what it was like to know such a legend, but if you're lucky you may get a sentence or two about her if you ask. And as they tell you their eyes will light up with the single mention of her name. They will begin to smile with a faint but hearty memory of her presence. And a single tear will roll down their cheek, as the begin to recall and tell you, the beginning of the legend of the Athletic Goddess, \\"The Big C\\". As for the male powerlifters in the current Skidmore Tynan Powerlifting team, a new legend is in the process, and his name is \\"Swole Cole\\" (Cole Martin). He is the son of Marshall Martin and the nephew of Kalvin Martin. He is about 5'2 in height but makes up for it in strength and determination. With the guidance of his uncle and father, he is the fastest, strongest, and most dedicated member of the entire team. He is the new guy who everyone knows and respects, and the beginning of his legend started this year, his freshman year in High School. The school thankfully has 3 more great years with him, so his legend has time to root and grow to one day maybe being of the same essence of that of \\"The Big C\\" but never quite as great. \\"Swoll Cole\\" continues to impress and will for many years to come.  Football  Skidmore Tynan's varsity football team captured the state title in 2013 with a 99-3 victory over the Cisco Lobos thanks to their star player, Marshall \\"The Net\\" Martin, who has been their starting Safety since his freshman year. He is so good, that they even changed their defense to revolve around him. They have moved all skill players on to the line and leave Martin to cover all deep portions of the field. Martin thought this up himself, and calls it his \\"Lone Wolf\\" Defense. Martin works in tandem with his friends, Cody \\"Chody\\" Garibay and Justin \\"the Baby-Faced Assassin\\" Hernandez, who are Skidmore's star Linemen. Garibay and Hernandez control the line of scrimmage like no one has ever seen. This is why the other players are assigned to the line. Half of them are told not to do anything, except hype up Garibay and Hernandez. The other half are told to head towards the end zone to get ready for the celebration when Hernandez recovers the fumble that he causes himself, or Martin picks it off if by the small chance that the ball makes it past the line of scrimmage. Skidmore has been so lucky to have these three All-American players at the same time, and John Livas was quoted as saying \\"I don't know what the program is going to do when these guys graduate, but we can't be selfish I guess. We were lucky enough to have them for the time we did, and they even turned down several D1 offers their freshman year because they loved this program so much.\\" Other honorable mention players of this year were Wyatt Scott , Logan Rios, and Alex \\"Alice\\" Hernandez. Visual and Performing Arts The High School also includes a fine arts department. S-T has classes for both marching and concert band.

It was directed by Beth McCarthy-Miller, and written by co-show runner and executive producer Robert Carlock. The episode originally aired on the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) network in the United States on January 19, 2012. Guest stars in this episode include James Marsden, Kelsey Grammer, and Denise Richards. In the episode, Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) calls upon the world's idiots for a protest, Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) tries to get Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) out of her head after he starts judging her boyfriend Criss (James Marsden), and Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) and Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) injure Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit), and call on Kelsey Grammer to help them. Plot Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) lets Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) know that he knows she has a boyfriend, and Liz is hesitant to let Jack into her love life, as he always judges her boyfriends. Sure enough, when Liz is with her new boyfriend, Criss, she imagines Jack criticizing all the little things she knows Jack would dislike about him. This troubles Liz, and she is troubled even more when Jack gives Criss money for him to start his business, as Liz knows this gives Jack more power in her relationship. Meanwhile, Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) offends gay people in a stand-up rant, and Liz writes an apology for him to be issued. Tracy takes offense to the fact that Liz calls him an idiot in it, and he calls upon all the idiots of the world (including special guest star Denise Richards) to strike in front of the building, which upsets Liz and perturbs Jack. Finally, Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) convinces Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) to sneak into a supply closet and get some lights for her dressing room, but he drops them, emitting mercury fumes into the air. Later, they find Pete in the closet unconscious, supposedly due to the fumes, so they call their former partner in crime Kelsey Grammer to help them clean up the situation. Reception According to the Nielsen Media Research, this episode of 30 Rock was watched by 4.05 million households in its original American broadcast. It earned a 1.6 rating/4 share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. This means that it was seen by 1.6 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 4 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. Kevin Fitzpatrick of TV Over Mind commented that the episode had him \\"consistently giggling throughout\\", adding \\"sometimes I feel like even the thinnest of 30 Rock plots could squeak by on charisma and non-sequiturs, but ‚ÄúIdiots are People Two!‚Äù kept a strong balance of Liz, Tracy and Jenna plots even without its second half next week.\\" However, he noted that the subject matter of Morgan's homophobic rant should have probably been left alone.

In the episode, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) deals with the return of Devon Banks (Will Arnett) and Liz Lemon's (Tina Fey) relationship with Criss (James Marsden), Liz deals with Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) and his protest for idiots, and Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer), Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski), and Kelsey Grammer attempt to clean up after Kenneth and Jenna accidentally poison and knock out Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit). Plot Criss (James Marsden) learns that Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) is the boss of Liz Lemon (Tina Fey), then gives Liz an ultimatum: Jack or him. Liz chooses him, but because she has been doubting Criss lately due to Jack being in her head, also says that maybe he could work on some things, angering Criss. Jack then deals with Devon Banks (Will Arnett), who tells him that in return for Jack getting his triplets into a prestigious school, he will stop attacking NBC for Tracy's homophobic comments. Jack pulls some favors, and does so, only for Devon to point out that Jack's daughter Liddy will now not get into the school, as Jack has exhausted his favors. Jack is upset at first, until he realizes, with the help of Tracy, that he had humble beginnings and became powerful, and he knows Liddy will do just fine. Liz tries to come to a conclusion about Criss, but also has to deal with Tracy's continuing \\"idiot protest.\\" She eventually creates a compromise with Tracy, where she reads an apology that they wrote for her. While reading it, she realizes that she wants to be with Criss because he makes her happy, and Jack sees this, approving of Criss for the time being, giving him three months to prove himself. Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) and Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) work with Kelsey Grammer to move the unconscious Pete (Scott Adsit), but because there are too many people backstage, Kelsey improvises a one-man show about Abraham Lincoln. They are able to sneak Pete to his office and set it up to make it look like he was practicing auto-erotic asphyxiation. Kelsey shows Liz, who is disgusted. The \\"Best Friends Gang\\" share champagne, and Jenna realizes the lights in her dressing room just needed to be switched on, and none of the events of their adventure actually had to occur.

He commented that \\"the jokes not only kept coming, but kept hitting, almost every time\\". Dan Forcella of TV Fanatic particularly praised Grammer's performance, calling him \\"absolutely hilarious\\" and adding \\"I'm not sure which was better, Kelsey deciding to make up a one man play about Abraham Lincoln in order to distract the people of 30 Rock, or the fact that he pulled it off and everyone in the crowd loved his performance.

Kevin Fitzpatrick of TV Over Mind gave a mixed review, calling it unnecessary that there was a separation between the two parts of \\"Idiots Are People\\" and accusing the Kelsey Grammer plot line of being insignificant.

He previously served as an editor of Radio Zamane. He is a member of Committee of Human Rights Reporters (CHRR), serving as the head from 2005-2009.  Life  Goudarzi was an aerospace engineering student at Sharif University of Technology before being expelled in November 2009 by order of government authorities and barred from continuing his education. He was detained twice in 2006 during peaceful rallies and three times after the events following the disputed presidential election results of 2009. Goudarzi was first arrested in March 2006 on International Women's Day as he was taking pictures during a rally with Shiva Nazarahari and they were released soon after. He was detained again in May 2006 on International Workers' Day while attending a Tehran Bus Company rally. He had disclosed to the Associated Press that a political prisoner, Akbar Mohammadi had died in prison after going on hunger strike to protest the lack of proper medical care.  2009 arrest  Goudarzi was detained a third time in the summer of 2009 during the street protests after the disputed presidential election results, and was released after a short period. He continued to take an active part in the 2009‚Äì2010 Iranian election protests, in which he joined other student activists in protesting the disputed victory of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad over opposition candidates Mir-Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi. On December 20, 2009 Goudarzi was among a group that was detained by regime forces as they were travelling to the city of Qom to attend the funeral services of the senior dissident cleric Ayatollah Montazeri. Goudarzi had reportedly angered Iranian authorities due to his human rights work and contents in his blog specifically asking for the release of jailed members of Committee of Human Rights Reporters (CHRR). Goudarzi and other members of Committee of Human Rights Reporters were put under heavy pressure through physical and psychological intimidation while in custody, to shut down the group's website. Goudarzi was denied access to his lawyer or his case file and was further harassed by being barred from visitation or phone calls, denied books and clothes, and being switched from cell to cell. His relatives revealed that he had sustained injuries during harsh interrogations requiring his head to be bandaged. Goudarzi told relatives that he was under immense pressure to accept false accusations made by intelligence personnel demanding that he \\"confess\\" to alliances with banned organizations. In August 2010, Goudarzi joined Majid Tavakoli and other imprisoned activists in a hunger strike to protest conditions in Evin prison, where they were detained. In retaliation Goudarzi, Tavakoli and other journalists who had launched a hunger strike were transferred to solitary confinement. Goudarzi and Tavakoli were among 17 political prisoners who went on hunger strike. After his transfer to solitary confinement in May 2010, Goudarzi's mother said that she was no longer allowed to see him. US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in a statement on June 12, 2010 demanded the release of Goudarzi and other incarcerated activists in Iran stating, ‚ÄúThe Iranian authorities responded to their citizens‚Äô call for accountability and transparency with violence, arbitrary detentions, dubious trials, and intimidation.‚Äù She called for \\"the immediate release of all imprisoned human rights defenders,\\" naming Goudarzi and six other jailed activists. Initially charged with the capital crime of moharebeh (waging war against God), Goudarzi was later charged instead with \\"spreading propaganda against the regime\\" and was handed a one-year prison sentence. He was released in December of the same year after serving his sentence. Joe Stork, deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch said about the charges against Goudarzi, ‚ÄúThe authorities should be working to ensure the rights and safety of citizens exercising their rights to gather peacefully. Instead, they are preparing the groundwork to impose the harshest of punishments.‚Äù Goudarzi spent 10 months in Tehran‚Äôs Evin Prison with periods in solitary confinement, and was transferred to Rajai Shahr Prison in Karaj, where he served the remainder of his prison term before being released upon serving his one-year sentence on December 14, 2010. During his prison term, Goudarzi was awarded the John Aubuchon Freedom of the Press Award from the US-based National Press Club. 2011 arrest On July 31, 2011 Goudarzi was violently arrested without warning by plainclothes officials. His flatmate and fellow blogger Behnam Ganji Khaibari was arrested as well. Goudarzi's mother Parvin Mokhtareh was arbitrarily detained as well the following day in the city of Kerman, for reasons said to stem from her advocacy on her son's behalf. Ganji was released a few weeks after the initial arrests. Friends described him as a \\"broken man\\" and stated that he and Goudarzi had been severely tortured. Following their release, Ganji and another friend of Goudarzi, Nahal Sahabi committed suicide on September 1, 2011 and September 28, 2011 respectively. The UK newspaper The Guardian reported following the suicides that \\"speculation is rife that the pair had been pressured while in jail to testify against Goudarzi\\". Amnesty International also reported that Ganji had been pressured to make a confession incriminating Goudarzi. It was reported that in the days following his detainment, a number of Kouhyar Goudarzi's friends and colleagues were summoned to present themselves at the offices of the Ministry of Intelligence for interrogation. For months, Iranian officials refused to acknowledge Goudarzi's arrest, and his whereabouts remained unknown. Authorities were reported to be attempting to fabricate evidence linking Goudarzi to the militant Islamic group People's Mujahedin of Iran. When they finally acknowledged his arrest, authorities denied Goudarzi's lawyer's requests to meet with him. They provided no information as to why he was arrested while deprived of his basic rights or why his mother was simultaneously detained in Kerman. Goudarzi's mother was said to be used as an example to the family members of other incarcerated activists. She had been very active in discussing the plight of her son during his previous incarceration. Goudarzi later said in an interview that his mother had \\"in a way become a model for the families of other political prisoners on how to inform others about their [loved ones] and not allow their rights to be violated.\\" In December 2011, after being held in the Kerman detention center of the Information Ministry and spending 8 months behind bars in Kerman prison, Goudarzi's mother Parvin Mokhtare was handed a 23-month prison sentence by the Kerman Revolutionary Court on the charges of ‚Äúacting against national security‚Äù and ‚Äúinterviewing with foreign media.‚Äù On March 18, 2012, she was released from Kerman Prison, in the south- eastern province of Kerman after the Court of Appeals suspended her 23-month prison sentence. She also paid a fine for the charge of \\"insulting the martyrs\\" before being released on bail. There was speculation that Goudarzi‚Äôs arrest stemmed from an interview he conducted with Spiegel International. Goudarzi had launched a hunger strike in solidarity with his friends in prison. In the interview Goudarzi said, ‚ÄúI've been out for the last seven months, but you always have one foot in prison if you campaign for human rights and are politically involved.‚Äù Following Goudarzi‚Äôs arrest ensued an international outcry from various individuals, states, and human rights organizations demanding his immediate release. Amnesty International expressed fears for his safety, named Goudarzi and his mother prisoners of conscience, and called for their immediate and unconditional release. The National Press Club expressed \\"outrage\\" over his detention, the Committee to Protect Journalists issued a statement on his behalf, and Reporters Without Borders condemned the arrest. Reporters Without Borders said that ‚Äúarbitrarily arresting and holding a political prisoner incommunicado is regarded as enforced disappearance by the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance. Article 2 of this convention bans ‚Äúthe arrest, detention, abduction or any other form of deprivation of liberty by agents of the state or by persons or groups of persons acting with the authorization, support or acquiescence of the state, followed by a refusal to acknowledge the deprivation of liberty or by concealment of the fate or whereabouts of the disappeared person, which place such a person outside the protection of the law. The National Press Club called on Iran‚Äôs government to set free the jailed Kouhyar Goudarzi his mother and all journalists and other citizens who have suffered retaliation merely for exercising the basic human right of self-expression. Front Line Defenders said it ‚Äúbelieves that Kouhyar Goudarzi arrest and incommunicado detention, as well as the arrest and detention of his mother Parvin Mokhtareh, is directly linked to Kouhyar Goudarzi's work as a human rights defender, in particular his work with CHRR.‚Äù Human Rights Watch said ‚ÄúDisappearing an Iranian citizen for more than six weeks without any semblance of legal process violates both Iranian and international laws which Iran‚Äôs government pretends to respect.‚Äù Lawyers‚Äô Rights Watch of Canada (LRWC) demanded, ‚ÄúThe Iranian government immediately cease the continued and unlawful harassment of Kouhyar Goudarzi,‚Äù and said ‚ÄúHarassment of Kouhyar Goudarzi is an attempt to silence his legitimate human rights activities and that his sentence of ‚Äúimprisonment in internal exile‚Äù is not provided for in Iranian legislation.‚Äù The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders said it, \\"denounces this new arbitrary verdict against Mr. Kouhyar Goudarzi since it seems to merely aim at sanctioning his legitimate human rights activities, amid the continuing repression of the Iranian civil society.\\" On April 12, 2012 after spending about 9 months behind bars, 3 months incommunicado with his whereabouts unknown, 2 months in solitary confinement under intense interrogations and torture, Goudarzi was released on bail pending his appeal.  Prison sentence  On March 7, 2012 while in prison, the courts informed Goudarzi he had received a 5-year prison sentence in exile at the remote city of Zabol, handed down to him on charges of ‚Äúspreading propaganda against the system‚Äù and ‚Äúgathering and colluding against national security.‚Äù With the insistence of the security apparatus, the sentence was upheld in September 2012 by Branch 54 of the Revolutionary Court.  Awards  In 2010 Goudarzi was presented the John Aubuchon Freedom of the Press Award from the National Press Club while he was behind bars. Alan Bjerga, the president of the club said at the award ceremony, ‚ÄúThis award is meant to honor those who have done their utmost to advance the cause of press freedom and open government.‚Äù He said Goudarzi reminded \\"us of the importance of working for a free press in the United States and abroad.\\" Kouhyar Goudarzi's mother Parvin Mokhtare, received the award on his behalf while he was still incarcerated. During the award ceremony, National Press Club president Mark Hamick, a broadcast journalist with the Associated Press expressed his outrage. ‚ÄúThe imprisonment of Kouhyar Goudarzi and his mother is a slap in the face to the world community.\\" The National Press Club called upon Iran to free all incarcerated journalists and political prisoners. In a letter to the National Press Club, Goudarzi‚Äôs mother Parvin Mokhtare said in part, ‚ÄúOn behalf of Kouhyar and myself I dedicate this award to the Green and great nation of Iran‚Ä¶ Since my son remains in prison at this time I hope someday he will be able to receive his prize in person. With greetings to all free people of the world.‚Äù  Exile  In March 2013, faced with a 5-year prison sentence in exile in the remote city of Zabol, constant pressures, harassment and threats from the authorities, Kouhyar Goudarzi fled Iran to ensure his safety. He continues his human rights work from outside the country.

Plot Galih (Rano Karno) and Ratna (Yessi Gusman) are two high school students who excel at everything they do; they are popular and receive good grades. Soon they begin falling in love. Despite Ratna's father objecting to their relationship, they continue to meet in secret. When Ratna's father finds out, he attempts to arrange for her to marry someone else. With Ratna receiving support from the other female members of her family, this fails; Ratna and Galih are able to continue dating. Production Gita Cinta dari SMA was based on Eddy D. Iskandar's 1978 novel of the same name. Rano Karno and Yessi Gusman were cast as Galih and Ratna, respectively; such was their chemistry that after the release of the film rumours circulated that the two were dating. Pop music singer Chrisye had a cameo as the singer of \\"Galih dan Ratna\\" (\\"Galih and Ratna\\"). The role was meant to further the marketing of his upcoming album Puspa Indah, which featured both \\"Galih dan Ratna\\" and another song from the film, \\"Gita Cinta\\" (\\"Love Song\\"). Release and reception Gita Cinta dari SMA was released in 1979. FilmIndonesia.org, an Indonesian film database, notes that Gita Cinta dari SMA was the third most viewed Indonesian film in Jakarta in 1979, selling 162,050 tickets. In 1980 it was followed by a sequel, Puspa Indah di Taman Hati (Beautiful Flower in the Heart's Garden). Adaptations In 2004, a soap opera starring Paundra Karna as Galih and Ratna Galih as Ratna was released by Indosiar. Its success led Iskandar to republish his original novel. A stage musical adaptation of the film, entitled Gita Cinta: The Musical (Love Song: The Musical), was run in Ismail Marzuki Cultural Centre in Central Jakarta from 19 to 21 March. Directed by Ari Tulang and with music provided by Dian HP Orchestra, the play required six days of casting in October 2009 and five months of preparation. Each performance involved forty actors, with rotating leads to ensure they would not be overexhausted; Gilang Dirgahari and Millane Fernandez played one pair of Galih and Ratna, while Mario Ginanjar and Mytha Lestari played the other. Dian HP noted that she was interested in working on the musical as the film was one of her childhood favourites.

Best known for his marine and aviation paintings, he was also a writer and illustrator. Early life and career His father, Cyril Lawrence Bagley was a carpenter, builder and architect and his mother was Madeline Elizabeth Bennett. Between 1927 and 1933 he attended Lee- on-the-Solent County Primary School and went on to study at Gosport Grammar School until he was fourteen. Throughout his early years it is said he only ever wanted to be an artist. In 1938 his father found him an apprenticeship as a draftsman at Airspeed Ltd. The company had recently relocated from York to Portsmouth Airfield. He suffered ill health as a teenager and at the age of 18 contracted meningitis and was admitted to hospital. In April 1940 the Airspeed design team moved from Portsmouth to Hatfield as part of a streamlining following their takeover by de Havilland. It is thought that he moved north with the company to complete his apprenticeship. During his time as a draughtsman at Airspeed Bagley drew what has now become the definitive cutaway drawing of the Horsa troop carrying glider. He moved to Leighton Buzzard and worked at Eaton Bray as a staff artist at Aeromodeller magazine. During his time with the magazine (and its sister publications: Model Maker, Model Boats, Scale Models, Model Cars, Model Railway News) he produced almost one hundred cover paintings, designed and drew model aircraft plans, and contributed numerous line illustrations for the magazine. He continued to paint occasional cover pictures for the magazine in the 1960s and early 70s. It was in Aeromodeller's offices at Eaton Bray that he met Kathleen Grant (Judy), who was working there as a tracer. The office romance flourished and in June 1947 they were married in Aldershot. They moved back to southern England where they rented a flat in Old Portsmouth. In 1950 their daughter Lindsey was born, and in 1953 their son Russell. Going freelance Through most of the 1950s Bagley worked at , a naval shore station in Portsmouth as a civilian Technical Illustrator. He worked in a small team producing artwork for educational and training films. The Admiralty pay rates were low in those austere times, so of necessity Bagley continued developing his freelance work in his spare time. His Holy Grail was to have a Flight magazine cover published. Time after time he sent paintings off on the train to London only to have them rejected until finally one was accepted. This was a tipping point in his career and more work began to come in from Flight and other publications. He also received commissions to provide artwork for railway posters for British Rail. In 1958 he finally left his secure position at Vernon to become a freelance artist. In 1953, as a commemoration of Queen Elizabeth's Coronation year, the government commissioned a number of artists, most of them famous, but also some upstarts, to paint pictures of the coronation. The then Ministry of Works commissioned three of Bagley's: The Procession Passing the Cenotaph plus Police Assembling at Dawn, Whitehall and Decorations in Whitehall, Coronation, June 1953. All three paintings are still in public ownership, under the auspices of the Government Art Collection. To this day the first of these paintings hangs in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in central London in an office overlooking Downing Street. Books In the same year Bagley's first book, How to Fly was published by Blackie and Son, followed by The Boy's Book of Aircraft in 1954. Both books were generously illustrated. A glowing review in Flight magazine of 1953 says: \\"... Mr. Bagley is up to date, knows his subject, writes in a breezy manner and‚Äîabove all‚Äî has illustrated his book with his own excellent drawings in black and white and colour.\\" In 1956 the growing Bagley family bought their first home, a newly built semi-detached house in Bedhampton. Bagley rented a small studio in Havant where he worked above Gardeners picture framing shop. They moved again in 1959 to a larger house in Lee-on-the-Solent where a spare bedroom was converted into a studio. His south facing upstairs room provided views over the Solent (until the late 70's when a block of flats was built behind the house). Commercial art At about this time he struck up a working friendship with Colin Paine of Embassy Art Agency (previously Astral Arts.) Between 1957 and 1968 Colin secured work for him with various clients including a David Brown Tractors calendar (1957), the prestigious launch brochure of the for P&O; (1958), commercial artwork for Nuffield Tractors (BMC), brochures for Wolseley Cars and many others. He painted a number of pictures for \\"Good Companion\\" jigsaw puzzles and even a few \\"painting by numbers\\" commissions. Prints In 1968 Bagley painted The Lone Sailor, a dramatic, stormy scene from Sir Alec Rose's famous solo circumnavigation. Alec Rose finished his journey in Portsmouth on 4 July 1968; fine art prints, cards and postcards were on sale widely, the same picture was used as the cover for Rose's book of his epic voyage: My Lively Lady. This was commercially his most successful and famous painting. The success of The Lone Sailor precipitated more commissions for prints including Harbour Twilight (1969), an atmospheric view from a Gosport boatyard across Portsmouth Harbour, and The Revenue Cutter (1970), a night scene of a Bristol Channel Pilot Cutter. Naval and military paintings Throughout the 70's Bagley painted dozens of impressions of Vosper Thornycroft warships, hovercraft and weapon systems which were widely reproduced in the company's sales literature, and many of the originals graced the walls of Vosper's boardrooms. In 1972 Bagley painted a set of illustrations for Christopher Dawson's history of Vosper Thornycroft: A Quest for Speed at Sea. Westland Aircraft Limited of Yeovil also used Bagley artwork for promotional literature of their helicopters. Throughout the 60s and 70s he painted vivid and dramatic scenes of the military and civilian variants of their aircraft. In the early 60's when Westland began to develop the hovercraft at the Saunders-Roe site (later to become The British Hovercraft Corporation) at Cowes, Isle of Wight, he painted dozens of artists impressions of their proposed new designs. Sailing Laurence Bagley maintained a working relationship with the staff at Yachting Monthly in particular with the then editor, Des Sleightholme. He produced a number of cover paintings for the magazine during the early 80s, along with some bundled giveaways which included posters and prints. Several of their articles were published with Bagley illustrations. He also produced the odd cover illustration for their rival publication, Practical Boat Owner during the same period. He had been a keen yachtsman for years, sailing mainly with an old friend who owned an 8-ton McGruer sloop. He spent many a sailing weekend away, sometimes crossing the channel to Cherbourg, or port hopping around the Solent. It was said that he was not an ideal crew, he was always grabbing his sketchbook. Eventually Bagley aspired to be the captain of his own ship, and in 1965 bought his own yacht, a 6-ton Hillyard \\"Fjord\\" which he kept on the River Hamble. Most weekends in the summer were spent sailing with his family around the Solent, usually ending up at the Folly Inn for dinner on Saturday night. Death On 22 October 1983, two days after his 61st birthday, Laurence Bagley died.

The architect of the building is EC Manfred. The foundation stone was laid and blessed on 17 March 1912 by Bishop John Gallagher of Goulburn, who also blessed the building during its opening ceremony in late 1913. It is two storeys high, and several extensions were added to the building throughout its early history. The orphanage amalgamated with St. Joseph's Orphanage for girls in 1976, and the remaining orphans were placed into group homes. As a result, the orphanage was closed in 1978 and rented out to the Youth with a Mission Base until they left in 1994. Since then, the orphanage has remained abandoned. Run by the Sisters of Mercy and the Catholic Church until its closure, the orphanage housed males from the ages of 5 to 16 initially. Its capacity was intended to be 100 children, but this peaked to more than 200 during the Second World War. By the 1970s, the orphanage began taking in female orphans from St. Joseph's because of declining numbers of males. Until its closure, the orphanage took in more than 2,500 individuals for various reasons. Only four per cent of those who stayed there were actually orphans. The orphanage's residents were given a religious education, and were trained in agriculture. Accounts by former residents state that they suffered severe beatings and punishments, and that they were issued a single set of clothing that was rarely washed. Another claims that some residents endured sexual abuse and rape, not only by the staff, but by older boys, and the caretaker. However, others state that the nuns were tough but fair and remained in contact with them. The orphanage is currently owned by businessman John Ferrara who has proposed a number of redevelopments on the site, including the building's restoration. The building has been heavily vandalised, and a series of fires have destroyed much its infrastructure. Ghost tours have been conducted in the building. It has been heritage listed by the Goulburn Mulwaree Council. Location St. John's Orphanage is located in the southern suburbs of Goulburn, a town in New South Wales. According to the Goulburn Evening Penny Post, the orphanage looks over one of the finest views of the town. The main front part of the building faces north, and the entrance gates are located on Mundy Street. The southern side of the lot connects off Combermere Street. The total size of the lot is 24,000 square metres (2.4 hectares or 5.9 acres). Architecture Exterior, interior and surroundings Main entry and southwestern wing of the building Gate entrance of St. John's Orphanage The building is two storeys high and includes an attic and basement. All walls are made of brick, some of which are hollow (mainly the external ones). The roof tiles are red, and the balconies have iron railings. The exterior design is plain struck brickwork, reassured by red bricks and cut stone. The entrance block is located on the westerly end of the front. Because of a sudden fall in the land, the pavement is several feet above the natural surface which necessitated a flight of stone steps towards the entrance. The main doors to the building have two windows alongside them and form a porch. The easterly end of the building has a balcony and a verandah, which are both . Away from the building, a milking shed is present. In addition, of land was purchased, which contained an ample field suitable enough for all types of gardening. Interior The entrance hall is with a tiled floor. The reception room is located on the right-hand side of the entrance hall. A moulded archway leads to the staircase hall, with the stairs being at right angles to the entrance doors. Rooms and areas that can be accessed from this hallway include the cellar, a sitting room which is in size, a children's study room that is by 6 metres and a children's refectory that is by 6 metres. A back door leads to verandahs that are found at the back of the building that allow access to various other rooms. A second staircase, surrounded by brick walls, can act as an escape route in case of a fire. The staircase floor is the colour of cement and is made out of hardwood with iron risers. The staircase also provides access to the chapel room, which is by 6 metres. Entrance archway Other rooms on the ground floor include a clothes room, a 6 by community room, a 6 by kitchen, a by 2.1-metre pantry and a by 3.65-metre lavatory. Bathrooms and shower bathrooms are fitted with hot and cold showers that are controlled from the lavatory. The laundry is with copper and tubs; the laundry also has a heater that supplies the whole building with hot water. The block which contains the sanitary requirements for the building is connected by a covered way and is well ventilated by air shafts, latticed doors, and louvres. Underground, a brick, cemented tank was built to collect and store rainwater. The second floor of the building contains a number of dormitories: a large, by 6-metre dormitory is present with a balcony on one side and a wide balcony on the other. A smaller, 9.1-metre by 6-metre dormitory is also present, as well as a 6-metre by 4.2-metre isolating room. Four bedrooms were designated for the Sisters of Mercy who were in charge of the building; these rooms were 3.65 metres by 3.04 metres and by respectively. The Sisters also had their own private bathroom. Almost every room in the building had a fireplace, surrounded by either bricks or a marble mantel and cement shelf. The ceilings on both floors are 3.96 metres high, and the whole building is fitted with electric light. The ceiling on the second floor is made out of plaster, whereas the ceiling on the first floor is made out of stamped steel. History Background and planning In 1905, an orphanage located nearby Kenmore Asylum was proposed at a general meeting of parishioners to replace an older orphanage that had been operating for more than 25 years on Clinton Street. The orphanage, which had catered to girls only, cared for approximately 50 girls per year, and the of land on which it was situated proved insufficient for the orphans. Thus, of land was purchased in nearby Kenmore for the proposed orphanage. Shortly after, the foundation stone was laid and blessed on the site. EC Manfred was the building's architect, and the contractors were Messrs. King and Armstrong. It was described as \\"severely simple Gothic\\" and cost ¬£6,000 to build. All of the girls from the old orphanage were removed, and boys aged eight and older were moved there and waited for a permanent home. An effort was made for people from Albury, Cootamundra, Wagga Wagga, Young and other places to take charge of the orphanage, but this was unsuccessful. Instead, the orphanage was established in Goulburn. Opening ceremony left On 17 March 1912, the foundation stone of the orphanage was laid and blessed by Bishop Gallagher of Goulburn. However, the orphanage was not opened officially until December 1913, when the opening ceremony was held on a Sunday afternoon, and the building was opened and blessed by Bishop Gallagher. The ceremony attracted a large audience, many of whom were not members of the Catholic Church. By 3:30p.m., the Australian Light Horse Band began marching towards the orphanage from a cathedral on Verner Street. The priests and the bishop brought up the rear walking behind several Catholic acolytes. While many attendees remained at the orphanage, hundreds walked along with the procession. Children who had marched with the procession were divided and formed a guard of honour. The bishop, who was accompanied by Father Cahill, entered the building and preceded to bless it; a crucifix was subsequently placed in the main dormitory of the building. After the blessing, the bishop addressed the attending crowd from the front verandah, and discussed the use of the building. In addition, the Bishop went on to say that Pagan civilisations consign orphans to death or slavery: Later history and closure The orphanage in its early years, 1919 The orphanage was run by the Sisters of Mercy and the Catholic Church until its closure in 1978. Shortly after opening, the orphanage experienced an increased demand for admission leading to the construction of a west wing and chapel in 1919. However, it remained unfurnished for some time due to lack of funding, and the Sisters of Mercy subsequently refused admission. A new wing for the building was constructed in 1924 dedicated to the memory of Bishop Gallagher. The new wing was opened and blessed by Reverend J. Barry; additional classrooms and dormitories were built, being by in size, followed by furnishing, painting and connection of sewer lines. The total cost was approximately ¬£2,676. In 1932, a milking shed and hall were built, and in 1938 new additions to the orphanage were added, costing ¬£2,575. This included a modification and extension to the south wing. The orphanage endured minor damage in 1943 when a fire broke out just after midnight and destroyed quantities of firewood and two panels of fencing. Throughout its 66 years of operating, the orphanage took in approximately 2,500 individuals. Approximately four per cent of all boys who stayed there were orphans, whereas the remainder had living parents; most of them either came from poor or troubled families who were unable to afford to look after them. The orphanage also took in child migrants. Only boys from the ages of 5 to 16 were taken care there. However, the Sisters of Mercy sometimes took in families in need or individuals who were 3 years old or younger. One of the Sisters of Mercy's aims was to keep brothers together if possible, and if they had sisters, they would be housed at the St. Joseph's Orphanage. Although the building could only house up to 100 boys, the capacity rose to between 140 and 250 boys during the Second World War, far above the suitable capacity of the building. In 1975, the orphanage began taking in girls from the St. Joseph's Orphanage due to declining numbers of boys, and, in 1976, amalgamated with the orphanage; this formed the St. John's Home, which would close in 1987. After 66 years in operation, the building closed in 1978. The remaining orphans were put into group homes. The Sisters of Mercy continued to care for these orphans until those homes closed in 1981. From 1979 to 1994, the building was leased to the Youth with a Mission Base, where people travelled from overseas to pursue discipleship training courses. The building has since been abandoned and left to deteriorate. In 2007, a proposal was made by former orphanage resident Jim Luthy to erect a memorial in Victoria Park for \\"all children who lived all or part of their lives\\" in a Goulburn orphanage or a church institution. Daily routine and life St. John's Orphanage Football Team, 1941 A school day at the orphanage would start at 6:00a.m. with many morning chores to be completed, predominately cleaning. A mass would be held at 7:15a.m., and breakfast would follow. Boys at the orphanage would then go to school. All boys over 14 were given a religious education at the Brother's Cathedral School, whereas the younger boys attended the infants' school at the Convent. All boys were also trained in technical education. Before leaving, the orphanage trained the boys in all classes of agriculture. This was so the boys were well educated and had the knowledge to become sufficient farmers when they left the orphanage. At the end of the day, the boys would play sports, boxing, or other leisure activities, or have hockey or rugby league training if the weather was suitable. Weekends revolved mainly around sports. Field hockey, rugby league, and other sports were commonly played during the winter time. The boys of the orphanage had a well-known reputation in Goulburn for their sports abilities; boys who participated in tournaments and games usually did well, winning many trophies. The orphanage also had a football team. Sometimes, the boys would hold fetes or participate in annual concerts and operettas, where they would sing and dance. Although all of the orphanage's residents were given a dose of Epsom salts once a week in the morning, some former residents have given accounts of brutal punishments and mistreatment. One states that because there were 200 boys and only 12 toilets, some would defecate in the urinals, drains, on the grass, or in their pants. As a result, the boys would receive beltings for doing this. Another account by a boy who stayed at the orphanage states that when he arrived there, he was separated from his brother and was given a set of clothes to wear despite having his own. Anyone who did not comply would receive a belting. The boys were issued no underwear and clothes were washed only once a week. Beatings were common, and not just for punishment; sometimes it may have been more for mental scarring. Other accounts claim there were beatings, and repetitive rape, not only by the staff but also by older boys and the orphanage caretaker. Despite this, some former residents say the nuns were \\"tough but fair\\" and they were fed three meals a day. Some even stayed in contact with their caregivers once they left. Status Damage due to vandalism in the southwestern wing The orphanage is currently abandoned, but the lot is owned by Australian businessman John Ferrara, who bought the orphanage and its surrounding grounds for $450,000 in 1999. Goulburn Ghost Tours has previously run ghost tours inside the orphanage, hoping to discourage vandals and youth from damaging the building. It is described as being a part of \\"Australia's Bermuda Triangle of haunted places\\", which includes Kenmore Asylum and St. Joseph's Orphanage. An occasional caretaker was also in place until the Catholic Church sold the building. The orphanage site is listed as a heritage conservation area under Goulburn Mulwaree Council's Local Environment Plan, which recognises its significance as a former boy's institution run by the Sisters of Mercy and the Catholic Church. The social and community values of the building are also recognised. Redevelopment and restoration A room on the second floor. Graffiti and abandoned furniture are commonly seen throughout the complex At present, the orphanage has been heavily vandalised, with surrounding residents regularly calling the police because the sounds of windows smashing and people entering without permission can be heard and seen frequently. Small grass fires around the building have also been reported. Restorations have been considered by the Goulburn City Council. The council is holding Ferrara accountable for allowing damage at the orphanage, while he has come up with many development projects for the lot. As a result, city council has not issued Ferrara any development permits until restoration work to the orphanage is complete. Ferrara has proposed a number of redevelopments for the orphanage itself, and its surroundings. In 2004, he proposed a plan to redevelop the lot and building into 63 residential units. The proposed redevelopment was known as Glebe Gardens. Ferrara planned the construction of gardens and pools on the vacant grounds, but the front of the complex would face no development. Although the development application was approved by the city council, the plans were dropped because the costs to redevelop the lot were too great. In 2009, work began to revamp the orphanage and convert it into a retirement village, with trees being cleared to construct a retaining wall. Two-metre-high walls were going to be built to keep vandals out and to prevent further damage. He also stated that he was going to the fix up the orphanage once the proposed townhouses were under construction. In 2012, Ferrara proposed a new project to build 76 units and homes in seven stages; these stages would have spanned three to four years. Ferrara undertook a joint venture with Peter Madew, who was to assist with funding and the management needed for the construction. They also proposed restoration efforts to the orphanage, which included painting, repairing holes in walls, and replacing windows. They also planned to restore the front garden, commence general landscaping, construct a recreation area, and build a number of units in the orphanage itself; an indoor swimming pool was proposed for construction in the courtyard. However, Madew claimed that restoration of the orphanage would \\"cost millions\\". Ferrara later announced that he would not go ahead with the redevelopment, but instead lodge a new plan: this plan would foresee the construction of 18 new dwellings on the lot. This was objected to by the council should the building remain in its current deteriorating state. Ferrara responded by stating he would commit funds from his profits towards the building's restoration, at a cost of least $1.5 million. In late 2013, Ferrara proposed another development on the lot which would see the construction of 15 residential units. However, the Goulburn Mulwaree Council has demanded that Ferrara must schedule repairs to the orphanage before any approval can be granted. In response, Ferarra pledged to spend $250,000 on restoration works, covering downpipe, guttering, and roof repairs, as well as window replacements and external painting. In November 2015, a fire, believed to have been left unattended by squatters, ignited the roof just before 4:00p.m. It took approximately six hours to extinguish the fire, during which 80% of the roof was damaged. Much of the roof collapsed, exposing the timber frame skeleton, and some rooms were completely destroyed. Moments before the building caught on fire, there were unconfirmed reports that a loud bang was heard. The Goulburn Heritage Group stated that they were \\"upset and sickened\\" by the fire, and Ferrara responded by saying that he was disappointed, and that the building was not insured. Ferrara has stated that he will try to preserve the building, and estimates the damage costs at $4 million to $5 million. In 2016, another fire occurred in a building at the rear of the main structure, causing extensive damage. The building, which was revealed to be the old hall built in 1932, was deemed not salvageable; it was subsequently scheduled for demolition. Following the fire, the council ordered Ferrara to secure both the site and loose building materials such as roof iron. The fire was treated as suspicious, as witnesses claim that two people wearing backpacks were running from the building just before the fire occurred. Following the second fire, a third fire occurred in the building, in which a large portion of the building was completely destroyed.

The novel was published in 1978, with its narrative set during the 1980s; however, a second edition was released in 1990, is considerably longer than the first version (1,200 pages compared to 800 pages), and is set in the 1990s. The two versions are essentially the same, although some content was added in the second version, including a new ending. The book was also adapted into a television mini-series, starring Gary Sinise, and was released by the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) network in 1994. In 2008, Marvel Comics published a comic book adaptation that was ended in 2012. Warner Bros. Pictures released an announcement in January 2011 that the company would be producing a movie remake of the King novel. The Stand's title logo This project never came to fruition, and the book was eventually adapted as a second miniseries for the streaming service CBS All Access, and is scheduled to be released sometime in 2020. Characters Project Blue =Specialist Charles D. Campion= Campion is an American soldier stationed in the California desert, as well as \\"patient zero\\", the original carrier of the superflu outside of its containment area. While Campion is on night duty, a deadly virus escapes the military complex he is monitoring. However, he manages to flee with his wife and baby daughter before the base enters lockdown. He finally succumbs to the superflu at a gas station in the fictional town of Arnette, East Texas, spreading the virus and unleashing the events of the story. In the 1994 miniseries, Campion was portrayed by Ray McKinnon. =General William \\"Billy\\" Starkey= As the commanding officer of Project Blue, Starkey is aware that, once loose, the superflu is almost impossible to control due to its constant mutations, meaning a vaccine to stop it will be impossible to create. Though compassionate, he goes to extreme lengths to cover up the accident and the ensuing pandemic for as long as he can; for example, he orders the execution of journalists who try to reveal the truth. In an attempt to maintain plausible deniability, he activates a contingency plan: to release the virus in several other continents in an effort to conceal the American origins of the artificial virus. After being dismissed by the President of the United States due to his failure to contain the virus, Starkey commits suicide in the laboratory where the superflu was created. In the 1994 miniseries, Starkey was portrayed by Ed Harris. = Major Len Creighton‚Ä† = Creighton is General Starkey's friend and right-hand man; he periodically updates Starkey on the situation. He assumes command of the containment operation after Starkey's removal and subsequent suicide. The character is last heard speaking to an army officer via radio in Los Angeles; it's unknown whether he survives the superflu. ‚Ä† This character is named Len Carsleigh in pre-1990 editions of The Stand. Boulder =Mother Abagail= Abagail Freemantle, also known as Mother Abagail, leads the \\"good\\" survivors of the Captain Trips plague and also claims to be a prophet of God. The survivors have dreams of her telling them to come see her in Nebraska. She is 108 years old and lives in a farmhouse near Hemingford Home, Nebraska, and was known in her community pre-superflu mainly for surviving vicious racism when she was younger and voting for Republicans in every election she had ever seen.Stephen King used the town Hemingford, Nebraska for both novels, The Stand, and It, America's heartland location for Mother Abagail. The Denver Post, USA Weekend, March 19, 2010, usaweekend.com, Who's News, by Patsy Parkin, page 2. Born to freed slaves from South Carolina, Abagail outlived a succession of three husbands, as well as her seven children. She is one of the 0.6% of the population that is immune to the Captain Trips virus and initially appears to some of the plague survivors in their dreams, drawing them to her, just as Randall Flagg (also known as the \\"Dark Man\\") draws the evil survivors to him. She and her followers make their way towards Boulder, Colorado, US, where they establish the \\"Boulder Free Zone\\" government. Abagail receives visions from God, though when she believes she has sinned due to pride, she loses her foresight and goes into exile in the wilderness. She later regains her ability and returns to the Boulder Free Zone, just in time to inadvertently save most of the Free Zone Committee from Harold Lauder's assassination attempt. On her deathbed, she shares one final vision: four men from the committee are to travel to the West coast to confront Flagg. She makes no prediction as to what will occur, only that one will fall before arriving in Las Vegas, while the remainder will be brought before Flagg. Mother Abagail dies shortly after revealing this prophecy. In the 1994 miniseries, Mother Abagail was portrayed by Ruby Dee, and is 106 years old. In the 2020 miniseries she was portrayed by Whoopi Goldberg. =Stuart Redman= A quiet, intelligent widower from Arnette, Texas, Redman is at his friend's gas station on the night that Campion arrives. Redman is the first man to be discovered with an immunity to the superflu and is taken by government authorities, first to the Atlanta Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), then to the fictitious Stovington, Vermont plague center. Redman escapes from the Stovington facility after a government employee attempts to execute him (the implication is that the character \\"knows too much\\") and he kills the would-be assassin in self-defense. After wandering through New England for several days, Redman meets and befriends Glen Bateman and, shortly after, Fran Goldsmith and Harold Lauder. Redman becomes romantically involved with Goldsmith despite of their large age gap, enter a marital relationship with her include accepting her unborn child; but their involvement causes resentment within Lauder, who holds an unrequited love for Goldsmith. Redman rises to authority in the Free Zone, becoming the spokesperson for the Free Zone Committee and acting as the Zone's first marshal. Following an assassination attempt by Lauder, Mother Abagail tells Redman that he is to travel west to confront Flagg. Redman, together with several other characters, travels to Las Vegas, but breaks his leg in Utah and is forced to remain behind, along with Kojak the dog. Redman develops pneumonia, due to injury and hypothermia, but witnesses the destruction of Las Vegas and is saved by Tom Cullen, who nurses him back to health. Redman and Cullen return to Boulder first by snowmobile and finally by foot, where Goldsmith has given birth to the first-known post-plague child. Redman and Goldsmith, who is pregnant again, this time by Redman, leave Boulder to raise their family in Ogunquit, Maine. In the 1994 miniseries, Stu was portrayed by Gary Sinise. In the 2020 miniseries, he was portrayed by James Marsden. =Frances Goldsmith= A college student from Ogunquit, Maine, Goldsmith (often called Frannie) is pregnant at the start of the book, a topic which resulted in a painful standoff with her mother and the end of her relationship with the baby's father, Jesse Rider. The superflu wipes out Goldsmith's community, with she and Lauder being the only local survivors, after a parking lot attendant, Gus Dinsmore, dies on June 30. It is also believed that Jesse is also dead. After burying her elderly father in his garden, Goldsmith decides on joining Lauder and they both leave the vacant town. The two make their way to the Stovington facility of the CDC, with the hope of finding someone in a position of authority; but before they reach their destination, they meet Redman. While Goldsmith agrees to the idea of Redman joining her and Lauder, Lauder reacts negatively, mainly due to his own feelings for Goldsmith. The three, along with Bateman, arrive at Stovington to confirm not only the deaths of everyone at the Stovington facility, but also that Redman was nearly killed there. The group then continues on their westward journey towards Mother Abagail, during which time, Goldsmith falls deeply in love with Redman, who is much older. This sentiment that she records in her diary, in addition to many other aspects of the trip. Harold confesses his love to Frances, and she politely but firmly rejects him, before she and Stuart reciprocate their feelings for each other despite their differences in age. They eventually enter a marital relationship once they settled in Boulder. Goldsmith serves on the original Free Zone Committee in Boulder and acts as its moral compass. Upon her union with Redman, Lauder becomes jealous, but later appears to have dealt with his emotions. However, Goldsmith remains suspicious of Lauder and this is later justified when she finds details of a plot to kill Redman in Lauder's diary (with the use of a bomb). Goldsmith saves the majority of the committee when she intuitively senses the presence of the planted bomb. Goldsmith is moderately injured in the blast, but her unborn child remains safe. Goldsmith is opposed to Redman traveling west, but comes to terms with the journey when she realizes that Redman is compelled to follow through with the trip. Goldsmith later takes up residence with Lucy Swann and delivers a baby boy. Although initial joy is experienced due to the birth, Goldsmith's child falls ill with the superflu and she is devastated. However, she is rewarded by news of both Redman's return to the Free Zone and her baby's recovery. Throughout the novel, Goldsmith becomes more and more homesick for her native Maine, and, at the end of the book she, Redman, and the baby return to Ogunquit; the last chapter also confirms that Goldsmith has become pregnant with her second child, with Redman as the father. In the 1994 miniseries, Frannie was portrayed by Molly Ringwald. In the 2020 miniseries, she was portrayed by Odessa Young. =Nick Andros= A 22-year-old deaf-mute drifter, originally from Caslin, Nebraska, Andros is beaten and robbed outside of (fictional) Shoyo, Arkansas by some local thugs, shortly after the start of the epidemic. Mildly injured in the assault and initially jailed, Andros is befriended by the local sheriff and his wife. Andros expresses intent to press charges against his attackers, and the sheriff jails three of the four that can be found, before falling ill with the superflu. Andros becomes the newest deputy, due to the absence of any other healthy people, and watches two of the four thugs who were responsible for assaulting him die of the plague at the local jail. The sheriff dies as well. Andros later frees the third prisoner, and tends to the sheriff's wife before she also dies. In the original novel, Andros falls from a bicycle and hits his head in the abandoned Shoyo, but scratches on his leg from the fall become infected and leave him sick for days. In the revised‚Äìexpanded edition of the novel, a sickened and fugitive Ray Booth (the fourth attacker of Andros) attacks him a second time in the emptied Shoyo. In the course of the attack, Booth nearly blinds one of Andros' eyes, and in a panic, Andros accidentally fires the gun holstered on his belt and the bullet scrapes his leg, causing the limb to become infected. Although Andros kills the plague-weakened Booth, the resulting damage to his eye means that he must wear an eye patch for most of the remaining story. Andros eventually recovers from the infection to his leg and begins his journey to Hemingford Home, Nebraska. Along the way he meets Cullen, and later, Brentner, June Brinkmeyer, Gina McCone, Dick Ellis, and Olivia Walker‚Äîthe group becomes a surrogate family to him. Andros leads the growing band of survivors to both Nebraska and Mother Abagail, who guides them on to Boulder. Andros serves on the Free Zone Committee, for which he is the leading thinker, and eventually recruits Cullen as a member of the spy contingent that travels to the West coast. He does not like or trust Harold Lauder and unilaterally nixes Lauder's initial placement on the FZC. Andros is killed by Lauder's assassination attempt on the committee and it is later revealed that it was Andros who was meant to lead the stand against Flagg. Andros later reappears as a spirit to Cullen and fully able to speak, guiding Cullen as he attempts to return home, and showing Cullen how to save the life of a very ill Redman. In the 1994 miniseries, Andros was portrayed by Rob Lowe, and is from Ridley, Pennsylvania. In the 2020 miniseries, he was portrayed by Henry Zaga. =Tom Cullen= Tom Cullen, a man initially thought to be in his mid-twenties to mid-thirties, appears to be mild to moderately intellectually challenged. Andros encounters him while cycling from Arkansas to Nebraska through Oklahoma. After Andros learns that Cullen remembers his father's return from the Korean War, he realizes that Cullen must be much older; perhaps in his forties. The two bond closely, despite the fact that Andros cannot speak and Cullen cannot read Andros' notes. When the two encounter Brentner, Cullen is finally able to learn Andros' name. Cullen's speech includes colloquialisms such as \\"My laws!\\" and \\"Laws, yes!\\" He frequently references himself in third person. Cullen also punctuates important points, believing them to be spelled \\"M-O-O-N\\" such as exclaiming, \\"M-O-O-N, that spells Nebraska!\\" When he is required to make a logical connection, Cullen can slip into a form of self- hypnosis, wherein he is able to make connections that he cannot while \\"awake\\" ‚Äî that is, conscious and focused on something superficial. Andros, Redman, and Bateman use this ability to place a post-hypnotic suggestion in Cullen that will help him to act as the third Free Zone spy. During Cullen's hypnosis, Andros, Redman, and Bateman discover that while hypnotized, Cullen possesses the same type of foresight as Mother Abagail, concurrently referring to himself as the \\"Tom\\" that Andros met in Oklahoma and \\"God‚Äôs Tom\\". Cullen travels west, transmitting a hypnotically-imprinted cover story to gain entrance into Las Vegas, and is able to avoid detection by Flagg. Cullen's anonymity seems to stem from his disability, as Flagg tells Jurgens that every time he tries to see the third spy, all he sees is the moon; this confirms Jurgens's sighting of Cullen earlier (while both were on Las Vegas work crews). It is Jurgens's desire to protect both Cullen and his status as a spy that compels her to commit suicide, rather than submit to further questioning from Flagg. The sight of the full moon rising over Las Vegas triggers Cullen's post-hypnotic suggestion and he begins the return trip to Boulder, appropriately noting, \\"M-O-O-N, that spells moon.\\" During his return trip to Boulder, Cullen encounters Redman, who is suffering from a broken leg and, due to exposure, pneumonia as well. Originally, Cullen was far east of where Redman fell, but a prophetic dream tells him that he must double-back to find Redman. With help from Andros' spirit, who appears to Cullen in visions (Andros was killed when Lauder's bomb exploded), Cullen is able to nurse a delirious and dying Redman back to health, while they are snowed in for much of the winter, in motels in central Utah (Green River) and western Colorado (Grand Junction). Together, the pair return to Boulder to report the destruction of Las Vegas. In the 1994 miniseries, Cullen was portrayed by Bill Fagerbakke. In the 2020 miniseries, he was portrayed by Brad William Henke. =Larry Underwood= Underwood is a young, narcissistic singer-songwriter who, at the beginning of the novel, is starting to achieve significant success with his debut single, \\"Baby, Can You Dig Your Man?\\" He tallies a debt with a drug dealer while living in Los Angeles and travels to New York City to hide, on the pretext of visiting his loving, but deeply disapproving, mother. When pressed, his mother points out his greatest character flaw to him directly, \\"You're a taker...you came home to me because you knew that I have to give.\\" As the plague and anarchy destroy New York, Underwood attempts to care for his dying mother, but he is unable to prevent her death from the superflu. Not long after, Underwood finds that he is one of the few living people remaining in New York City. He meets a troubled middle-aged woman named Rita Blakemoor and the two decide to leave New York together. They experience a frightening trek through the Lincoln Tunnel while leaving the island, an incident that Underwood is often haunted by in the remainder of the narrative. Blakemoor eventually dies from a drug overdose that Underwood describes as \\"70% accident and 30% suicide.\\" He feels guilty over his relief that he does not have to deal with Rita anymore, a confirmation of his mother's assessment of him. Haunted by his dreams of Flagg and of Rita, Underwood is in a semi-catatonic state of self reflection for several days until he finally collapses from exhaustion in New Hampshire. This event is the beginning of a turning point in Larry's life; a change of soul, from that of a \\"taker\\" to something more. Recovering after a night's sleep, Underwood travels to Maine, where he plans to spend the summer; until he meets Nadine Cross and the young Leo Rockway (known then only as \\"Joe\\" and behaving like a feral creature). The three travel together to Ogunquit, where they find Lauder's painted sign and the directions that it displays. Deciding to follow the directions, Underwood leads Cross and Joe to Stovington, Vermont, meeting Lucy Swann along the way. In Stovington, they find only Lauder's directions to Nebraska. Underwood, who gradually finds himself in the unexpected role of a trusted group leader, brings a growing party of people across the country to Nebraska, and finally to Boulder. Although Underwood is initially interested in Cross, she spurns his advances and he begins a relationship with Swann instead. Arriving in Boulder, Underwood settles down with Swann and Joe, becoming a member of the Free Zone Committee. Cross attempts to reconcile her relationship with Underwood, but he refuses to be amenable, choosing to remain with Swann. Underwood later breaks into Lauder's home with Goldsmith, after Joe instructs him to embark on an investigation before something horrible happens. They find Lauder's ledger, in which Lauder has documented his intention to kill Redman. However, Lauder's plan is already in motion at this stage and Redman narrowly escapes the assassination attempt the next day. Underwood leaves Boulder with Redman, Brentner, and Bateman, after Mother Abagail instructs them to go to Las Vegas. Underwood leads the party after Redman breaks his leg during the journey to Las Vegas, where Underwood and Brentner eventually die in the nuclear explosion caused by the Trashcan Man. In the 1994 miniseries, Larry was portrayed by Adam Storke. He does not meet Rita Blakemoor in New York, instead meeting Nadine there, alone. After traveling with her, she abandons him. He later meets Lucy and Joe, and travels with them to Boulder. In the 2020 miniseries, he was portrayed by Jovan Adepo. =Harold Lauder= Lauder is sixteen years old and lives in Ogunquit, Maine, at the beginning of the novel. He is the younger brother of Goldsmith's best friend, Amy Lauder, and is a social outcast at his local high school. Lauder's obnoxiousness and arrogance hinder his ability to interact with others and engage as an active member of the community in the novel. After the superflu wipes out the entire population of Ogunquit, except for himself and Goldsmith, the two head to the Stovington Plague Center in Vermont. Lauder leaves a prominent note on the roof of a barn, as it overlooks the most popular route into town, detailing their plans for future travelers. This ongoing effort by Lauder enables several other groups to join together in Colorado. Lauder harbors an unrequited obsessive love with Goldsmith and perceives himself as her protector. When the pair meets Redman, Lauder initially refuses to accept Redman, even going so far as to threaten him with a gun; after a conversation in which Redman explains to Lauder that he just wants to accompany the pair and is not withholding any desire towards Goldsmith, Lauder relents. After the plague facility proves to be a disappointment, the survivors head towards Nebraska, before reaching Colorado to join Mother Abagail; the group pick up more survivors during their journey. Lauder attempts to profess his love to Goldsmith but is rejected. As Goldsmith becomes more involved with Redman, Lauder's jealousy grows. Lauder seeks out Goldsmith's journal and finds she mocks him in her private thoughts, and considers him to be \\"immature\\". Lauder swears vengeance upon Goldsmith and Redman from that point onward. Lauder becomes a respected and esteemed member of the Boulder Community. Due to the harsh conditions after the plague, he has dropped his excess weight, his acne has cleared, and his intelligence is often seen as an asset by those around him, rather than an isolating hindrance, as it was perceived in his former life. His ideas are used to improve the conditions within the community and Lauder frequently volunteers for the toughest jobs in the Boulder Free Zone, including the removal of dead bodies. It's due to his thin, sharp, resilient persona that Lauder earns the nickname, \\"Hawk\\"; the nickname is a show of respect from the other men on the work crews. Regardless of his newfound status, Lauder continues to find it difficult to let go of his old self-image. In a moment of emotional clarity, Lauder realizes that he is accepted and valued, and that he can choose a new life for himself as a respected member of society. Unable to cast aside his past humiliations and his feelings of betrayal from Goldsmith and Redman, Lauder instead focuses on vengeance. Lauder reaches the point of readying his gun to assassinate Redman, while scouting for a missing Mother Abagail, but doesn't pull the trigger. Soon after this incident, Nadine Cross approaches Lauder and reveals an in-depth knowledge of Lauder's insecurities, hatreds, and fears; she also alludes to her own. Cross and Lauder enjoy a decadent series of sexual escapades; but Nadine does not allow Harold to perform vaginal intercourse with her, as she has engaged in a supernaturally-inspired commitment with Flagg. Lauder succumbs to Cross' seduction, fulfilling Flagg's wishes by creating a bomb to destroy the Free Zone Committee (FZC). While those who meet Lauder suspect there is something troublesome about him, they keep their suspicions to themselves as they become preoccupied with the politics of the Free Zone and the recruitment of scouts to spy on Flagg. Nick Andros is an exception to this, unilaterally nixing Lauder's appointment to the FZC because he doesn't trust him. Larry Underwood thinks Harold is a politician type and has mixed feelings about him, while Leo Rockway refuses to even go near Harold and tells Larry that he feels scared. After detonating the bomb, which kills seven people, Lauder and Cross flee toward Las Vegas. Lauder wrecks his motorcycle and breaks his leg after slipping on an oil slick. It's implied that Flagg, mistrustful of Lauder for being \\"too full of thoughts\\", arranged the accident. Lauder survives, though badly injured, and attempts to shoot Cross, who abandons him. Realizing that he is dying, Lauder writes a note in which he takes responsibility for his actions and expresses remorse, which he signs, \\"Hawk\\", as a way of accepting the best version of himself that existed briefly in Boulder. Lauder then commits suicide by shooting himself in the head; his body is later found by Redman's traveling group and they do not bury his corpse, choosing to leave it intact beyond Stu's simple gesture of gently removing the pistol from Harold's mouth and tossing it aside. To Redman's surprise, he finds himself wanting to avenge Lauder's death along with the bombing victims when he finally encounters Flagg. In the 1994 miniseries, Harold was portrayed by Corin Nemec. In the miniseries, Stu's group does not find his body, rather Stu psychically senses his suicide. In the 2020 miniseries, he was portrayed by Owen Teague. =Nadine Cross= A teacher at a private school in New Hampshire, Cross has retained her virginity due to a vaguely defined, but powerful, sense that she is destined for something described by the novel's author as dark and unique. After the outbreak of the superflu, Cross finds an emotionally damaged young boy whom she calls \\"Joe,\\" who has regressed to a savage state of mind but trusts Cross and remains with her. Cross meets Underwood when Joe finds him sleeping‚ÄîJoe is working up the courage to kill the sleeping Underwood, but Cross prevents the potential murder. The pair secretly follows Underwood to Maine, where Joe attempts once again to kill Underwood, but is overpowered. After a discussion with Underwood, Cross agrees to join Underwood and find other survivors. Cross is attracted to Underwood but her subconscious conviction that she must remain \\"pure\\" has further strengthened and has begun to manifest‚ÄîCross begins to both fear and anticipate that she is destined to be with Flagg. Upon arriving in Boulder, Cross begins to surrender to the seductive allure of Flagg. Joe, who has sufficiently recovered to the point that he reveals that his real name is \\"Leo Rockway\\", is suddenly reluctant to be in the company of Cross. Later, Rockway reveals that Cross had already known that it was too late to engage in sexual relations with Underwood. Cross desperately proceeds with a final attempt to seduce Underwood, an act that would break her virginal commitment to Flagg and free her, but Underwood is, by this stage, firmly committed to Swann and rejects Cross's advances. Cross eventually surrenders to Flagg completely, communicating with him with the use of a Ouija board ‚Äî an echo of her terrifying experience with a Ouija board in college, when she was first touched by Flagg. Cross then seduces Lauder and, although she will not do \\"that one little thing\\" with him, they are apparently free to sexually engage in any other manner that they wish. Cross uses Lauder for the purpose of an assassination attempt to eliminate the committee members. This plot is ultimately hindered by the return of Mother Abagail and Goldsmith's premonition. Cross travels west with Lauder, but when Lauder's motorcycle crashes, she implies that it was her intention for Lauder to die in a motorcycle accident, instead of being killed by Flagg upon their arrival in Las Vegas. Lauder fires his pistol at Cross and nearly hits her, suggesting that Cross may unconsciously prefer death to the dark consummation awaiting her in Las Vegas; and also revealing limitations to Flagg's power. Cross continues on towards Las Vegas, until Flagg appears to her in the desert‚ÄîFlagg reveals his true nature to Cross by raping her, an experience that is so horrific to Cross, despite causing her immense pleasure, that she falls into catatonia. Flagg takes Cross with him to Las Vegas and the pair reside in the penthouse suite of the MGM Grand hotel complex; Cross's pregnancy is announced shortly after their arrival in Las Vegas. Cross eventually recovers sufficiently to taunt Flagg about his inevitable failure until, in his rage, Flagg throws Cross off the penthouse sundeck and she is killed in the fall. Cross smiles as she falls and afterward Flagg observes that she had taunted him in the hopes that he would kill her. In the 1994 miniseries, Cross was portrayed by Laura San Giacomo. She is an amalgamation of herself and Rita Blakemoor in the novel. She meets Larry in New York, but leaves him after nearly sleeping with him, later being brought to Boulder by Teddy Weizak. In the 2020 miniseries, she was portrayed by Amber Heard. =Glen Bateman= An associate professor of sociology who went into retirement some years before the superflu hit, Glendon Pequod \\"Glen\\" Bateman met Redman near his home in Woodsville, New Hampshire. A senior citizen handicapped by arthritis, the character of Bateman is often available to dispense advice to the younger Redman. Bateman also experiences dreams of Mother Abagail and joins Redman, Goldsmith, and Lauder on their journey to meet Mother Abagail (and to satisfy a sociological curiosity as to how humanity will rebuild itself). Bateman becomes part of the reform committee in Boulder and is later one of the four men who must meet Flagg in Las Vegas. When Redman is seriously injured on the journey, Bateman is saddened to leave him behind. Bateman, along with Larry Underwood and Ralph Brentner, travels to Las Vegas where he is detained by Flagg's forces. Flagg offers Bateman his freedom on the provision that he proceeds to \\"get down on [his] knees and beg for it.\\" Bateman refuses, laughing at Flagg for being so transparent, leading Flagg to order Lloyd Henreid to execute Bateman. \\"It‚Äôs all right, Mr. Henreid\\", Bateman says as he dies, \\"you don‚Äôt know any better.\\" In the 1994 miniseries, Bateman was portrayed by Ray Walston. In the 2020 miniseries, he was portrayed by Greg Kinnear. =Ralph Brentner= Ralph Brentner, an amiable Midwest farmer and United States Army veteran, meets Andros and Cullen as their paths cross on a highway between Oklahoma and Nebraska‚Äîtogether they form the first party to find Mother Abagail. Despite a lack of formal education, Brentner possesses a great deal of common sense and is very skilled with tools and machines; Brentner uses a powerful radio transmitter to contact other groups of survivors across the country. Brentner is elected to the first Free Zone Committee, a position that he accepts reluctantly and typically serves as Andros' \\"voice\\", reading his notes to the others during committee meetings. Brentner survives Lauder's assassination attempt‚Äîbut loses the third and fourth fingers on his left hand‚Äîand is chosen as one of the four people to stand against Flagg. Along with Redman, Bateman, and Underwood, Brentner walks to Las Vegas and is instrumental in convincing Underwood to leave Redman behind after he breaks his leg. Brentner is captured by Flagg, along with Bateman and Underwood, and Flagg plans an execution by dismemberment to occur in front of the Golden Nugget Hotel in downtown Las Vegas. Brentner is the first to notice the \\"Hand of God\\" as it descends from the sky to detonate the Trashcan Man's nuclear weapon, killing everyone present. In the 1994 miniseries, Brentner was portrayed by Peter van Norden. In the 2020 miniseries the character was renamed Ray Brentner and is portrayed by Irene Bedard. =Kojak= Kojak is Bateman's dog, an Irish Setter, whom he adopted after his original master died of the superflu. Formerly named Big Steve, Kojak is a rare survivor of the superflu, a virus that can affect dogs and horses as well as humans (though the book notes that cats are immune). When Bateman leaves with Redman, Kojak is initially left behind. However, he follows his owner and is later attacked by wolves after arriving at Mother Abagail's empty house. Though injured, Kojak manages to walk to the Free Zone. He joins Bateman, Redman, Brentner, and Underwood on their journey to Las Vegas. When Redman is injured, Kojak stays behind, killing small animals to feed Redman and fetching sticks for fire-building. After being found by Tom Cullen, Kojak is taken back to Boulder. It is stated in the novel that he will live for sixteen years after his master's death, and that a female puppy is found near Boulder, indicating that the canine species will survive. In the 1994 miniseries, Kojak is a golden retriever mix. =Susan Stern= Part of an unwilling harem of women who were taken captive by evil superflu survivors and repeatedly raped, Susan‚Äîa former student at Kent State University‚Äîis one of the women Redman and his party rescues (note: this version of her earlier experience is only in the revised‚Äìexpanded version of the novel.) Stern becomes a member of the original Boulder Free Zone Committee and recruits fellow captive, Dayna Jurgens, to serve as a spy on the West Coast. Stern is later killed by Lauder's bomb while in Brentner's home. In the 1994 miniseries, Susan was portrayed by Cynthia Garris. She is not rescued from the harem, but is instead found by Nick Andros and his party on the road to Nebraska, and arrives at Mother Abagail's home along with Nick, Tom Cullen, Ralph Brentner, Dick Ellis and Gina McKone. After reaching Boulder, she begins a relationship with Brad Kitchener, the only technician, even trying to have children with him. =Dayna Jurgens= Dayna Jurgens is a community college physical training (PT) instructor from Xenia, Ohio (one of the women whom Redman's party rescues from the harem in the revised‚Äìexpanded version). While she originally seems to display some level of romantic interest in Redman, this does not extend beyond flirtation and the two kiss before she leaves to spy on the West coast. Jurgens's affectionate behavior towards Redman causes Goldsmith feelings of consternation ‚Äì later, it is revealed that Jurgens is bisexual. After residing in Boulder for a brief period, Stern recruits Jurgens (both were captives in the same harem) to spy on the West Coast. In Las Vegas, Jurgens works with a streetlight-repair crew and sleeps with Lloyd Henreid as part of her ploy to obtain information. While working with the crew, she observes Tom Cullen on a passing truck. Flagg, aware of her identity through telepathy, summons her to his office and attempts to make her reveal the third spy, whose mind he is unable to penetrate. To protect Cullen and save herself from torture at the hand of Flagg, Jurgens commits suicide by ramming her head through a plate glass window and turning so that the broken edges slice open her jugular vein. This act of free will indicates the beginning of Flagg's downfall, as, while he foresaw her attempt to assassinate him and consequently thwarted the attempt, he did not predict her suicide attempt and could therefore not prevent her death. Jurgens's body is desecrated by Flagg and is later burned outside of Las Vegas. In the 1994 miniseries, Dayna was portrayed by Kellie Overbey. She is not rescued from the harem, instead being in a relationship with a man named Mark when she is found by Redman's party. Mark later dies of appendicitis, depressing her, mixing her role with that of Perion from the novel. =Lucy Swann= The first survivor encountered by Underwood's party, 24-year-old New Hampshire housewife, Lucy Swann, has survived the superflu, while her husband and daughter died. Swann joins the party on its route to the Stovington Plague Center. The character becomes romantically involved with Larry Underwood, a sentiment that she senses is unrequited due to Underwood's strong attraction to Cross; Swann's feeling persists even though Cross is seemingly uninterested in the object of her affection. However, when forced to make a decision, Underwood chooses to remain with Swann, much to Swann's surprise. Swann supports Underwood during his tenure as a member of the Free Zone Committee, in addition to serving as a devoted wife and as a mother to Rockway. Unlike Goldsmith, Swann supports Underwood's decision to travel west to confront Flagg; although, she is unaware that she is pregnant at the time. Swann takes care of Goldsmith during Redman's absence and, by the end of the book, she has given birth to twins. In the 1994 miniseries, Lucy was portrayed by Bridgit Ryan. =Judge Farris= Farris is a man in his late-seventies who joins Underwood's traveling party in Illinois while it is making its way to Nebraska. Usually referred to as The Judge, Farris is a sharp, well-spoken, educated, and insightful man who served as a judge in the 1950s, but has since retired. Swann and Underwood become very close with Farris, and Underwood is upset when he successfully recruits The Judge as the first Free Zone spy, but is unable to inform a distraught Swann of the Judge's whereabouts after he \\"vanishes\\". When Underwood and Farris have a couple beers at \\"The Judge's\\" house porch, he actually accepts the duty before Underwood can even muster the confidence to make the request, as he understands the importance of the mission, assuring a saddened Underwood that he will be fine. The Judge attempts to infiltrate Las Vegas from the north, but is intercepted by Flagg's sentries in Idaho. The Judge is killed by several shots to the head; however, the Judge's death is a direct violation of Flagg's orders and is a sign that Flagg's power is fallible. The sentries had been under strict orders not to \\"mark his head\\", so that the head could be delivered as a message to the Free Zone, and the narrative suggests that Flagg brutally kills the surviving sentry, Bobby Terry, for disfiguring the Judge's face and hampering his plan. In the 1994 miniseries, Judge Farris was portrayed by Ossie Davis, and travels to Boulder as part of Redman's party, rather than Underwood's. Las Vegas =Randall Flagg= Randall Flagg, also known as the Dark Man, the Tall Man, or the Walkin' Dude, is the main antagonist of the novel‚Äîhe is the embodiment of evil, an antichrist-like being whose goal is destruction and death. In the novel, he's presented as diametrically opposed to Mother Abagail's personification of good. Flagg's appearance shifts between human, demon, and various animals, and it is implied that he has lived many lives during many eras; \\"Flagg\\" is merely the name of the force's present form. Cullen describes Flagg in the following manner: \\"He looks like anybody you see on the street. But when he grins, birds fall dead off telephone lines. When he looks at you a certain way, your prostate goes bad and your urine burns. The grass yellows up and dies where he spits. He‚Äôs always outside. He came out of time. He doesn‚Äôt know himself.\\" During the occasional instances when the reader is subject to Flagg's perspective, it becomes evident that Flagg does not know his origins, has no memory of his life before Captain Trips ‚Äî though he vaguely remembers isolated, violent, or hateful events, such as participating in the Vietnam War, actions as an American Marine, Ku Klux Klan lynchings, the murder of police officers, taking part in race riots in the 1960s, being involved in the kidnapping of Patty Hearst, and a vague speculation that he was involved in Charles Manson's family. Most of Flagg's memories indicate that not only was Flagg able to escape during the last moments of many of these events, but that the events also nourished his evil nature. Like Mother Abagail, Flagg appears to various survivors in their dreams, whereby he provides the dreamers with a choice; Flagg attracts those who are drawn to structure, destruction, and power. He rescues Lloyd Henreid from starvation in prison and, with Henreid as second-in-command, establishes a community in Las Vegas, Nevada. Although Flagg possesses the ability to predict the future, along with several demonic powers, as the events of the book's narrative unfold, he begins to very gradually lose his power as his plans proceed in an increasingly problematic manner. A weakness of Flagg's that turns out to be completely disastrous for him and his followers is that Flagg cannot read the minds or track the movements of individuals who have mental deficits or illness, and some of these individuals end up destroying Flagg's key plans to rule the world. At the end of the novel, the \\"Hand of God\\" detonates a nuclear bomb, destroying Flagg's gathered followers, as well as Las Vegas. The revised‚Äìexpanded edition of the novel includes an epilogue in which Flagg, in a new incarnation, awakens in an unknown tropical location where he meets a primitive tribe; Flagg then attempts to convince the tribe's members that he has arrived to teach them the ways of civilization, identifying himself as Russell Faraday. In the 1994 miniseries, Flagg was portrayed by Jamey Sheridan. In the 2020 miniseries, he was portrayed by Alexander Skarsg√•rd. King revealed in an interview that Flagg was partially inspired by Legion; Flagg is a hollow demon filled with other people's fear, hatred, and resentment. However, instead of Satan, as has been suggested in relation to the Dark Man, King compared Flagg to 1950s serial killer, Charles Starkweather. In other media The Dark Man character appears in many guises in other King novels and short stories, always with the initials \\"R.F.\\" This powerful character is found throughout King's other stories, most notably in The Dark Tower series. It's through The Dark Tower series that readers have been able further understand the multifarious character, as King reveals that he was born with the name \\"Walter Padick\\" and that his father was Sam the Miller of Eastar'd Barony. Padick was raped by a drifter at the age of thirteen during an explorative journey outside of his home area, whereby the young man wanted to experience the wider world. Following the passing of numerous centuries, Padick became an emissary for the Crimson King and assumes a range of identities, including Randall Flagg. Flagg is also the main villain in The Eyes of the Dragon, set in a medieval world called Delain, and there are some passages in that book that allude to Flagg's immortality and \\"pure evil\\" status. =Lloyd Henreid= Lloyd Henreid starts off as a petty criminal who, along with Andrew \\"Poke\\" Freeman, engages in a killing spree across Nevada, Arizona, and New Mexico, resulting in six murders, Freeman's death, and Henreid's detention in a Phoenix jail. If Henreid undergoes his scheduled trial, it is likely that he will be placed on death row under a new statute that reduces the delays and appeals in the capital punishment process. Once the plague hits, Henreid's fellow prisoners become fatal victims of the superflu, in addition to the guards. In the midst of the commotion, Henreid is forgotten in his cell and eventually becomes the sole-surviving inhabitant of the prison complex. Henreid's character demonstrates both resilience and an ability to forecast problems by rapidly concluding that his situation is growing dire well before the cessation of regular services to inmates. Henreid is able to save himself from starvation by eating food that he has saved, along with whatever rats, roaches, or other vermin he can catch‚Äîhe also very nearly consumes the leg of a dead cellmate (in the revised‚Äìexpanded version, Flagg insinuates that Henreid did indeed eat some human flesh, despite Henreid's attempts to hide the cuts in the leg before the Dark Man arrived). Henreid is found by Flagg, who frees him from his cell after Henreid, at that point starving and nearly delirious, agrees to be Flagg's right-hand man, despite Henreid's suspicion that his liberator is actually a devil. At this time, Flagg also gives Henreid a black stone with a red flaw to symbolize Henreid's allegiance to Flagg. Henreid subsequently finds himself feeling more intelligent and able than he thought he was, running several of the day-to-day activities in Las Vegas and overseeing operations at a military base. Henreid attributes his newfound abilities to Flagg, although Jurgens later suspects that Henreid's natural ability to anticipate problems has only been amplified by a fear of disappointing Flagg through failure. For saving his life and elevating him to his second-in-command position, Henreid is fiercely loyal to Flagg, a commitment that persists despite his growing doubts over Flagg's overall power and control. The character's loyalty is further affirmed when he foregoes an opportunity to leave Las Vegas with several close friends; however, Henreid respects the decision of the men who plan to abandon Las Vegas and does not inform Flagg about the deserters. Flagg forces Henreid to shoot Bateman and, as Bateman dies, he forgives Henreid with his dying breath, saying \\"It's all right, Mr. Henreid.... you don‚Äôt know any better.\\" At the execution of Underwood and Brentner, Henreid is then killed in the nuclear explosion caused by the Trashcan Man's atomic warhead. Prior to his death, Henreid's last words are: \\"Oh shit, we're all fucked!\\" In the 1994 miniseries, Henreid was portrayed by Miguel Ferrer. In the 2020 miniseries, he was portrayed by Nat Wolff. =\\"The Trashcan Man\\"= Donald Merwin Elbert, better known as the \\"Trashcan Man\\", is a schizophrenic with pyromaniac tendencies. He often found himself in trouble during his years as a youth due to his fixation with fire, and his nickname comes from his childhood habit of starting fires in trash cans. The Trashcan Man received electroshock therapy at a mental hospital in Terre Haute, Indiana, before being incarcerated for arson as a teenager. The superflu wipes out the inmate and guard populations at the prison where the Trashcan Man is incarcerated, and he is able to escape home to (the fictional) Powtanville, Indiana. The Trashcan Man indulges his ambition of burning down cities, first setting fire to oil tanks in Powtanville and then destroying the city of Gary, Indiana. While running from the Powtanville fires, he vaults over a railing and breaks his right wrist; the fracture doesn't properly set and the injury eventually causes his hand to point away from his body at an almost ninety-degree angle. Later, while setting the fires in Gary, he sustains severe burns to his left arm when a timing device he has placed in an oil tank ignites prematurely. The Trashcan Man abandons his original plans of starting fires randomly across America to join Flagg when the Dark Man appears in his dreams and promises the Trashcan Man \\"great work\\" in the desert. After treating his severely burned arm, the Trashcan Man finds a bicycle and proceeds to travel westward with haste. In the revised-expanded version, the Trashcan Man briefly travels with a cocky street thug named The Kid, who becomes severely intoxicated and forces the Trashcan Man to masturbate him. When The Kid threatens to not only kill the Trashcan Man on several occasions (always for petty reasons) but also to overthrow the Dark Man, Flagg sends wolves to rid himself of this potential rival. East of Colorado's Eisenhower Tunnel, The Kid ends up trapped in a car and surrounded by wolves, which kill him when he eventually tries to flee. With the threat of \\"The Kid\\" neutralized, the Trashcan Man continues west to Las Vegas, where he receives a black stone with a red flaw and becomes one of Flagg's key associates. Due to his savant talent regarding destructive devices, the Trashcan Man is assigned to search for weapons in the desert and assist in arming the fighter aircraft at Indian Springs Air Force Base. The Trashcan Man performs his duties with proficiency until, while being teased by fellow workers, a comment causes him to experience a flashback regarding his tormented youth. The Trashcan Man undergoes a schizophrenic episode and reverts to his old destructive ways, destroying several trucks and aircraft while killing the most experienced pilots in Las Vegas. He flees into the desert, overcome with anguish over his actions; at first he plans to kill himself, but later he seeks redemption by bringing Flagg the most powerful weapon he can find: an atomic bomb in the form of a nuclear warhead that has been detached from a missile. The Trashcan Man transports the warhead across the desert in a trailer attached to an all- terrain vehicle, contracting a lethal case of radiation poisoning in the process. The sickness has reached its terminal stage when the Trashcan Man arrives in Las Vegas. The Trashcan Man ultimately causes Flagg's apparent destruction, as the Hand of God descends from the sky and activates the warhead, destroying Las Vegas and every one of its inhabitants. In the 1994 miniseries, the Trashcan Man was portrayed by Matt Frewer. In the 2020 miniseries, he was portrayed by Marilyn Manson. =\\"The Kid\\"= \\"The Kid\\" is a thug from Shreveport, Louisiana, who meets the Trashcan Man during the latter's journey to Las Vegas. The character drives an enhanced hot rod-style vehicle and has a fanatical love of Coors beer and Rebel Yell whiskey. The Kid is also ambitious, unstable, and easily angered, traits that the Trashcan Man discovers when the character nearly kills him for spilling a can of beer on a carpet. After becoming severely intoxicated on alcohol, The Kid forces the Trashcan Man to give him a handjob while he concurrently sodomises the Trashcan Man with a pistol. The Kid and the Trashcan Man travel together until they reach the blocked Eisenhower Tunnel. The Kid has revealed to the Trashcan Man that he intends to replace Flagg, so Flagg sends wolves that trap the Kid in a car. The Kid survives for several days until, facing starvation, he opens the car door and strangles a wolf as he himself dies. The Kid's body is later found by Redman, Underwood, Bateman, and Brentner on their journey to Las Vegas. Underwood calls him \\"the Wolfman\\" and wonders what his story is. In the original edition, The Kid appeared as a minor character and only appeared in the Trashcan Man's flashbacks; the revised‚Äìextended edition includes the full story of The Kid's encounter with the Trashcan Man. The Kid does not appear in the 1994 miniseries, nor is he mentioned. =Julie Lawry= An unstable, sex-crazed teenager who lives through the pandemic, Lawry and Nick Andros have sexual intercourse in the deserted store where they meet and then Lawry attempts to convince Andros to leave Cullen behind. However, when Lawry reveals her true nature, ridiculing Cullen's impairment and frightening him against Pepto-Bismol with a claim that the product is poison, Andros ultimately rejects her. Lawry then tries to kill them both with a rifle and ends up joining Flagg. In Las Vegas she recognizes Cullen and informs Henreid of Cullen's status as a spy. Lawry is killed in the nuclear explosion that destroys Las Vegas. In the 1994 miniseries, Lawry was portrayed by Shawnee Smith. In the 2020 miniseries, she was portrayed by Katherine McNamara. =Whitney Horgan= A former butcher, Horgan joined Flagg's group as a cook, described by Lloyd Henreid as a \\"fat, loud sack of shit\\" but also an excellent chef. He performs minor tasks but is highly ranked in Flagg's society, reporting directly to Henreid or Flagg himself. Horgan plans to flee to Brazil with several others after first asking a reluctant Henreid to join them. Henreid ultimately refuses the offer, but quietly tells his friend he will keep his flight plan secret, while adding he will never leave Flagg regardless of consequences. Horgan decides to take a \\"stand\\" against Flagg and publicly challenges him prior to the executions of Underwood and Brentner. Flagg initially tells Horgan that he has intended to let him leave without consequence, but then mutilates and eventually kills Horgan with a ball of lightning that emanates from his finger. The lightning that killed him gathers in the sky over the next few moments before descending as the Hand of God and activating the Trashcan Man's nuclear bomb. In the 1994 miniseries, Horgan was portrayed by Sam Anderson. =Jenny Engstrom= A former nightclub dancer, Engstrom awaits Flagg in Las Vegas with Ronnie and Hector and kisses Flagg's boots upon her arrival. She works for the group as a construction worker and becomes close friends with Jurgens, who is confused as to why Engstrom, whom Jurgens perceives as a \\"nice\\" person, is cooperating with an evil group. Engstrom discovers Jurgens's true purpose in Las Vegas and subsequently betrays her by informing Flagg of her newfound discovery. Later, Horgan informs Henreid that Engstrom intends to flee the group, while Flagg tells Henreid that he already knows the names of people who want to leave, including Engstrom. Engstrom is present during the executions and is thus killed during the explosion of the nuclear bomb. Engstrom does not appear in the 1994 miniseries. Her character was merged with that of Julie Lawry. =Barry Dorgan= Barry Dorgan is a friendly former detective of the police department in Santa Monica, California, US. Although he is an ally of Flagg, Dorgan does so only because he thinks Flagg's world is the only society with a chance of regaining a sense of law and order, but Dorgan eventually loses faith in Flagg's society and remains in Las Vegas because Flagg will murder him if he leaves. Dorgan is one of the sentries who intercepts Underwood, Bateman, and Brentner, who are all surprised by Dorgan's sympathetic nature but make it clear his rational views do not excuse or exculpate his service on behalf of the truly vile individuals he reports to. Dorgan stands guard over Underwood and Brentner shortly before their planned executions and is eventually killed by the Trashcan Man's nuclear bomb. In the 1994 miniseries, Dorgan was portrayed by Chuck Adamson. =The Rat Man= \\"Ratty\\" Erwins, also known as The Rat Man, is a pirate-like hoodlum. Erwins wears a red sash, a necklace of silver dollars around his neck, and a sword. The character is described, in Lawry's words, as \\"the only guy in Las Vegas too creepy [for Lawry] to sleep with; except maybe in a pinch\\". Erwins is killed in the explosion at the end of the book. In the 1994 miniseries, The Rat Man was portrayed by Rick Aviles. He is first seen in New York when the plague hits, and says \\"The Rat Man forgive you, this time\\" when Larry bumps into him in an arcade. He later appears very prominently in Flagg's society, and accompanies Lloyd in sending the Trashcan Man to Flagg, later is among the group which apprehends Dayna Jurgens, and breaks Larry's guitar before he and Ralph are taken on stage to die by dismemberment. In the 2020 miniseries the character is renamed The Rat Woman and is portrayed by Fiona Dourif. =Bobby Terry and Dave Roberts= Bobby Terry and Dave Roberts are among the men who Flagg places at several outposts surrounding Las Vegas to intercept and kill Free Zone spy Judge Farris. The sentries are also ordered to not \\"mark the head\\" as Flagg wishes to send it back to the Free Zone before winter. Terry and Roberts are placed at an outpost close to a dam. One rainy day while Terry is distracted by a comic book, he barely sees the Judge drive by in the Scout that Flagg told them to look for. When Terry and Roberts catch up to the Judge, Roberts feigns friendliness long enough to shake Judge Farris's hand. Farris sees Terry in the car, holding a rifle and smiling wildly, prompting The Judge to attempt to pull his own gun, but Roberts shoots him first. Before Roberts can finish the job, Terry (unnecessarily) fires from the car, accidentally shooting Roberts through the neck. Terry and the wounded Farris exchange shots until Terry scores a kill with two direct hits to the face, leaving it unidentifiable. Terry panics over what to do, eventually deciding to head south. However, Flagg (who observed all of this in the guise of a crow) attacks and slowly executes Terry. In the 1994 miniseries, Terry was portrayed by Sam Raimi, while Roberts was portrayed by John Dunbar.

It tells the story of a woman, Ren√©e N√©r√©, who after a divorce becomes a dancer in music halls. It was inspired by Colette's own experiences. Synopsis Divorced after eight years of her husband‚Äôs faithlessness and cruelty, Ren√©e N√©r√© has been struggling to support herself as a music-hall performer for the past three years. The first part of the three parts of the book opens as she waits in her dressing room until it is time for her to perform. She checks her make- up in the mirror that she hates to face, then goes off to perform, no longer anxious, but confident and controlled. Ren√©e‚Äôs life as an artist is described: her work as a dancer, her casual relations with her fellow performers, the small apartment that she shares with her maid, Blandine, and her dog Fossette, and her introduction to Maxime Dufferein-Chautel. Maxime presents himself at her dressing-room door one evening, and Ren√©e dismisses him as an awkward intruder, charming and respectful as he seems to be. She more formally meets him again after a private engagement arranged by his brother. Night after night, Ren√©e‚Äôs admirer watches her from the front row and patiently waits for her. With her old friend Hamond acting as a go-between, Ren√©e and Maxime slowly and slightly become more friendly. Maxime visits her; she acknowledges that she has an admirer, but nothing more. Eventually, their acquaintance deepens, but not into intimacy, despite Maxime‚Äôs pleas. This continues until Ren√©e signs a contract for a six-week tour with Brague, her mentor, and his pupil. Now she must decide between Maxime and her career, as she recognizes that she cannot allow him to accompany her and is not yet ready to give up the wandering life, which somehow suits her. She then lies, promising to give herself to Maxime, but not until the tour is over. Ren√©e leaves Paris, full of both hope and regret. Ren√©e travels from one place to another. This part of the story is told primarily in the form of letters to Maxime, sprinkled with accounts of performances, and thoughts about her relationship with him. The book ends with her final letter to him and the thoughts that she directs toward him as she leaves the letter are unfinished. Reception Frances Keene called The Vagabond an \\"enchanting, sincere and beautifully constructed novel\\" in a 1955 review for The New York Times. Keene complimented the book's English translation, but wrote: \\"It is a pity that its title has had to be transliterated. What 'La Vagabonde' means, of course, is 'The Wanderer,' as Renee Nere points out when considering second marriage: 'I shall have everything ... and I shall lean over the edge of a white terrace smothered with the roses of my gardens and shall see the lords of the earth, the wanderers, pass by!'\\" Keene ended the review: \\"Colette has the natural sober tone, the importance attached to feelings, the graceful brevity which Maurois once said 'define one of the forms of the French novel.' But above all her occasional hoarse cry of loss voices the complex anguish of our time.\\" In 2011, James Hopkin wrote about The Vagabond for The Guardian: \\"Has the novel dated in the course of a century? Not at all. There's enough energy and inventiveness here to blow away any dusty hints of antiquarian charm. And for years I've been telling people that no one writes about relationships as perceptively as Colette.\\" See also * 1910 in literature * 20th-century French literature References 1910 French novels Novels by Colette Novels set in Paris ","title":"The Vagabond (novel)"},{"id":"34244276","text":"La Vagabonde may refer to: * The Vagabond (novel), a 1910 novel by the French writer Colette * La Vagabonde (trail), a cycling route (Route Verte) in Quebec *La Vagabonde, catamaran sailed by creators of YouTube channel Sailing La Vagabonde See also *Le Vagabond or The Littlest Hobo, a Canadian film and television series *Vagabond (disambiguation) ","title":"La Vagabonde"},{"id":"34244300","text":"Christopher Orr is a Paralympic medalist from New Zealand who competed in alpine skiing.

It is a facultatively heterofermentative Lactobacillus species (placed in Group II, with species able to produce either alcohol or lactic acid from sugars).  Uses  Antilisterial strains of L. sakei are used in Europe for the production of saucisson and can be used for the conservation of fresh meat. Lactobacillus sakei strains isolated from traditional dry sausage have a potential use as starter cultures. Inhibition of Listeria monocytogenes in chicken cold cuts can be obtained by addition of sakacin P and sakacin P-producing Lactobacillus sakei. Strain 2a of the subspecies Lactobacillus sakei subsp. sakei can also be isolated from meat products. Research suggests that L. sakei may play a role in maintaining healthy sinus cavities and preventing sinusitis.  Biochemistry   Bacteriocins production  Sakacins are bacteriocins of class II produced by L. sakei. In strain CCUG 42687, their production is dependent on nutrients, temperature and pH. Using the same strain, sakacin P can be produced in a completely defined medium. In strain CTC 494, the presence of salt and a curing agent (sodium chloride and sodium nitrite) reduces the production of the antilisterial bacteriocin sakacin K.The Presence of Salt and a Curing Agent Reduces Bacteriocin Production by Lactobacillus sakei CTC 494, a Potential Starter Culture for Sausage Fermentation. Fr√©d√©ric Leroy and Luc de Vuyst, Appl. Environ. Microbiol., December 1999, vol. 65, no. 12, pages 5350-5356 (abstract) Growth of CTC 494 is also dependent on nutrients availability. Lactocin S is a bacteriocin produced by strain L45 of Lactobacillus sakei.  Exopolysaccharide biosynthesis  Strain 0‚Äì1 of Lactobacillus sakei produces exopolysaccharides.  Prevention  Eugenol is a chemical compound that can be used to reduce the presence of L. sakei as it disrupts its cellular membranes.  Genetics  Genetic diversity within Lactobacillus sakei can be assessed through the use of specifically designed PCR primers for detection using randomly amplified polymorphic DNA.  Bacteriocin genes  Bacteriocin genes are located either on chromosomes or on plasmids. Strain 5 produces a plasmid-encoded bacteriocin that is identical to sakacin P, as well as two chromosomally encoded bacteriocins, which were designated sakacin T and sakacin X. LasX is a transcriptional regulator of the lactocin S biosynthetic genes in strain L45 of Lactobacillus sakei.  Other genes  In strain LTH677, a starter organism used in meat fermentation, there is an oxygen- dependent regulation of the expression of the catalase gene katA.Oxygen- Dependent Regulation of the Expression of the Catalase Gene katA of Lactobacillus sakei LTH677.

There is only one gene (IdhL) responsible for the lactic fermentation.  Plasmids  A Theta-type plasmid has been characterized in Lactobacillus sakei in 2003. It is a potential basis for Low-Copy-Number vectors in Lactobacilli. Vectors for inducible gene expression in Lactobacillus sakei can be constructed. The key elements of these vectors are a regulatable promoter involved in the production of the bacteriocins sakacin A and sakacin P and the genes encoding the cognate histidine protein kinase and response regulator that are necessary to activate this promoter upon induction by a peptide pheromone.

Sources  The most detailed source of information on the campaign is the Tamil stele of Rajendra Chola I.Sastri, p 211 The stele states: The Thiruvalangadu plates, from the fourteenth year of Rajendra Chola I, mentions his conquest of Kadaram but does not go into the details. The first attempt by someone from outside India to identify the places associated with the campaign was made by epigraphist E. Hultzsch, who had published the stele in 1891.Sastri, p 212 Hultzsch identified the principalities mentioned in the inscription with places ruled by the Pandyan Dynasty. In 1903, he rescinded his theory and stated that the stele described Rajendra Chola I's conquest of Bago in Burma. George Coed√®s' Le Royaume de Sri Vijaya published in 1918 after several years of research, rejected both the theories and provided the first convincing description of Rajendra Chola I's conquest of Southeast Asia.Sastri, p 213  Causes  The relation between Srivijaya and the Chola dynasty of southern India was initially friendly during the reign of Raja Raja Chola I.

The campaign also led to the establishment of diplomatic ties with China. The first Indian embassy to the court of the Song Emperor was sent by Raja Raja Chola I in 1015. This was followed by a second embassy by his son, Rajendra Chola I, in 1033 and a third by Kulothunga Chola I in 1077. The Chola Empire did not establish its direct rule over South-East Asia thought they might have levied a periodic tribute. Traders from the Tamil country firmly established themselves over various parts of South-East Asia. A merchant guild was set up in Burma and another in Sumatra in 1088. Indian historian V. R. Ramachandra Dikshitar suggests that Tamil traders of the Chola period might have had a knowledge of Australia and Polynesia.

Two films based on the novel, and sharing the same title, have been released: one in 1970 directed by Jules Dassin and another in 2017 directed by Eric Barbier. Romain Gary tells the story of his childhood and his youth with his mother, a former Russian actress carried by a love and unconditional faith in her son. The story, full of humor and tenderness, tells the story of her tireless fight against adversity, the extravagant energy she deploys so that he knows a great destiny and the efforts of Romain, who is ready to do anything to make his life coincide \\"with the naive dream of the one he loves\\". The first part begins with the reveries of a mature Romain, remembering how, out of love for his mother, he decided to challenge the stupidity and wickedness of the world. She then relates her childhood years in the Polish city of Wilno (now Vilnius). Romain's mother instills in him his dreams of triumph: he will be a great man, admired and adulated, a great seducer, a great artist. They will go to France, a country she has all the virtues of. During a brief period of prosperity, linked to the success of a \\"haute couture house\\" led by his mother, he enjoys an extravagant lifestyle and a myriad of teachers. His mother pushes him unsuccessfully into various artistic activities and he himself does his best to discover talent. He begins to write (or more precisely to seek pseudonyms evocative of his future glory). He reveals that he has become what his mother predicted: a recognized writer, a war hero, evoking the penniless period that followed their arrival in Wilno. His mother, to his great shame, proclaimed his ambitions to the neighbors, and was quenched in return for quips. The bankruptcy of the fashion house brings them back to hard times. They settle in Warsaw, \\"of passage\\" before returning to what they consider their \\"real\\" country, France. A humiliation at school - he did not react when his mother was called \\"cocotte\\" - decides to leave for Nice. In the second part, the narrator refers to his adolescence in Nice: the mother of Romain, despite her energy in the face of adversity, is forced to ask for help - we imagine that she addresses the father of Romain. Romain devotes himself to writing, in order to reach the expected glory. He also makes his first experiences as a man, provoking his mother's pride. She finally finds stability by becoming a manager of the Hotel-Pension Mermonts. Existence becomes happy. However, Romain is won by the anxiety of not succeeding in time to offer his victory to his mother, when it turns out to be diabetic, which she had been hiding for two years. Sick, aged, she continues to struggle with force and to convey to her son his certainty of a bright future for him. He went to Aix, then to Paris to do a law degree, and in 1938, became an officer cadet at the air school of Salon-de-Provence. But his promotion is refused because he has only recently become a French citizen, and he must invent a lie to avoid his mother too painful disappointment. When the war breaks out, he leaves as a corporal. He sees her again in 1940, on leave, and leaves her very unwell. The third part is devoted to the war years, during which he receives from his mother innumerable letters of encouragement and exhortation to valor. Having joined the air force of Free France, he fought in Great Britain, Africa and ended the war with the rank of captain. He is made Companion of the Liberation, officer of the legion of honor. He published in 1945 European Education in England, which received a favorable response and was offered to enter diplomacy for \\"exceptional services\\". Returning to Nice at the end of the war, he discovers that his mother died three and a half years before his return, after having charged a friend to transmit to her son over 250 letters that she had written for her son.

Design and development The first prototype of the M106 was built and flown in the Slovak Republic around 2003. Its constant chord wing has twin tubular aluminium spars with wooden ribs and, like the rest of the aircraft, is fabric covered. The wing, with 2¬∞ of dihedral, carries pushrod-operated Frise ailerons and manual flaps. On each side a pair of V-form lift struts of circular cross section brace the wing to the lower fuselage longerons, assisted by further jury struts. The fuselage and empennage have a steel alloy structure. The fin and rudder are swept and the horizontal tail placed slightly above the upper fuselage line; the fin and tailplane are wire braced together. The port elevator carries a trim tab. There is side-by-side seating for two under the wing leading edge. After trials with Rotax and Volkswagen engines, Lambert chose the Belgian 61 kW (82 hp) ULPower UL260i flat-four to power the M106. The development period also produced changes to the undercarriage, which initially had V-strut main legs and half-axles. These were replaced with cantilever spring glass fiber legs. The standard M106 has a fixed tailwheel undercarriage, though tricycle gear is an option. The wheels may be faired. A glass cockpit electronic flight instrument system is standard equipment. Production began in late 2005 with a batch of eight aircraft built in the Slovak Republic and assembled in Belgium. Belgian CAA certification was obtained in April 2006. The M106 is built to meet the European ULM maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) limits of 450 kg (992 lb) and is available only in flyaway form; the M108 variant is heavier, intended for areas which allow higher MTOWs, and may be kit built.

He was partly responsible for the introduction of Expressionism to South Africa. His paintings and monotypes have earned him recognition as a sincere and gifted artist. Early life and education Studio, oil on canvas, 500 x 300 mm, Sanlam Art Collection Wolf Kibel was born in Grodzisk Mazowiecki, a shtetl 32 km from Warsaw, in Russian Poland. Kibel's father came from a family of singers and was employed by the community in the capacity of hazzan and shochet. He was relatively well paid and able to support a large family, of which Wolf was the third boy and fifth child of six. The family prized artistry; his father not only sang professionally, but carved miniatures, composed cantorial music, wrote verse and did bookbinding. Wolf participated in the choir his father trained and carved grotesques from his father's oil-stones. At the age of three he was sent to the local school to be educated in Jewish culture. In 1911, when Wolf was eight, his father died, leaving the family bereft of financial support. With the outbreak of the First World War, they decided to move to Warsaw. There Wolf was apprenticed to a bookbinder, but lost this position after an accident. The family moved back to Grodzisk Mazowiecki and Wolf was apprenticed to a maker of shoe uppers. He apparently disliked this enough to run away to the countryside for several days, after which he was allowed to pursue his drawing and painting freely. A friend of relatives in London, named Appelbaum, looked up the family when he visited Poland to paint a synagogue. It was the first time a professional artist saw Wolf's work. Appelbaum took him to Warsaw, where he met other artists, visited art galleries and read books and periodicals. He was impressed by the paintings of Jozef Isra√´ls and admired the pictures of Jan Matejko. Early career and travels Vienna After the Treaty of Versailles, signed on 28 June 1919, nationalist Poles engaged in a wave of pogroms. This hostility, along with the prospect of conscription, persuaded Wolf to go to Paris in 1923. He crossed Czechoslovakia and arrived in Vienna several months later, having journeyed 524 km on foot. The end of the war was also the end of Austria-Hungary, and Vienna was an impoverished city full of refugees. Accommodation was in short supply and Kibel frequently resorted to sleeping in the Wiener Prater. An antique dealer introduced him to the portrait painter Edmund Pick-Morino. Pick-Morino found Kibel a patron, a rich banker, and allowed him to draw and paint his models, some of whom were society ladies, wearing masks. He appears to have come into contact with the work of Oskar Kokoschka. However, his impoverished existence soon wore on him and, since he could not travel to Paris without papers, he was persuaded by Pick-Morino to go to Palestine. Jerusalem Bezalel buildings, Jerusalem, 1913 In 1925, Kibel left Vienna for Haifa, then to Jerusalem, contracting malaria along the way. In Jerusalem he went straight to hospital, and was discharged after two days, still very ill. Peripatetic and homeless, his only possession was a letter of introduction to the director of the Bezalel Art School, Boris Shatz, from Pick-Morino. He was disappointed by the patriotic Bezalel school pictures the pupils were expected to paint, and decided to go to Tel Aviv. Tel Aviv Still suffering from malaria and penniless, he slept on the beach. His only luck came when he visited a cousin, who worked as an immigration officer, who took him to a private doctor for a course of Salvarsan injections, which cured the malaria. A friend by the name of Popek, subsisting on a tiny dairy farm on the outskirts of Tel Aviv with his wife, took him in. When Kibel insisted on not imposing on their kindness and made to leave, Popek pressed upon him his saving book, with enough money for him to find a room in the city. Now with some means, he met many painters, becoming friends with influential painter Yitzhak Frenkel, who had spent seven years in Paris. Though they spent much time together, Wolf would never be a pupil of Frenkel's. It was in Tel Aviv that Wolf would meet his future wife Freda, and by her accounts they were an active part of a group of outspoken, highly critical and ambitious young people who preferred painting, literature, music, drama, even sport over politics. The artists were fanatical in their admiration for Paul C√©zanne, to the point of slavish imitation. Kibel found this attitude dangerous and often expressed his beliefs to his friends. Kibel had great admiration for Marc Chagall, whose work he considered to be a highlight of contemporary painting. He also came into contact with the work of Henri Matisse and was impressed by his skilled formalism. Bialik House, Tel Aviv, 1924 Kibel's chief media in Tel Aviv were watercolour and black and white drawing, requiring extreme control, since it dries quickly and mistakes are difficult to correct. This was also by financial necessity, since oil paints were more expensive. Kibel would only start painting in oils when a certain Dr. Zlockisty volunteered to supply the necessary materials. He met the famous Hebrew poet Hayim Nahman Bialik, who patronised his work. They became firm friends. After four years in Palestine, Kibel passed the citizenship examination in Hebrew and became a Palestinian citizen. He had been stateless since birth. Coincidentally, an affidavit arrived from his brother Sam, who had settled in Cape Town, South Africa. The affidavit gave him permission to live in the Union of South Africa. Kibel's brother did not know he had a wife, and Freda left for Krakow in December 1928 where she gave birth to their first child. Cape Town Kibel arrived in Cape Town on 27 June 1929, the day their son Joseph was born in Krakow. He lived with his brother, who was a cantor in the synagogue in the Company's Gardens, but soon found that they did not see eye-to-eye on his continued pursuit of his art career, and felt regret at having moved to South Africa. Kibel soon took lodgings at the house of Roza van Gelden, principal of a primary school, who also offered him a studio at the school in exchange for lessons. The art galleries in Cape Town were of no interest to Kibel, and he found its citizens indifferent to painting. He decided to hold an exhibition at Martin Melck House in December 1931, with the intention of raising money to join his wife and son in Tel Aviv. His work was met with outrage by a public and a coterie of art critics, notably Bernard Lewis of Die Burger, who were unfamiliar with or hostile towards the avant-garde art movements of the time. Notable exceptions were the art teacher Frank Barrington Craig, who praised his show, and artist Hugo Naud√©, who was impressed enough to invite Kibel to his house in Worcester. Kibel took up the invitation to visit Hugo Naud√© and his wife, stayed on, and learned the technique of etching in his studio. The kindness of the Naud√©s persuaded Wolf and Freda that Paris would be too difficult an adjustment and Freda and Joseph arrived in Cape Town on 19 January 1933. Freda Kibel records that he was doing much work from life and using a wide variety of media: pastel, oil, watercolour, tempera, chalk, pen, etching and others. The influence of Matisse seemed to have disappeared in favour of a personally developed style. Kibel moved his studio to a dilapidated building in Roeland Street, Cape Town, called Palm Studios, the upper storey of which he shared with friend and artist Lippy Lipshitz, who had just returned from Paris. The artists took pupils in order to augment their meagre income. His 1935 exhibition at Ashbey's Gallery, opened by Lipshitz, was again met with public abuse, but favourable review by Melvin Simmers of the Cape Times, under the heading Virile Exhibition by Wolf Kibel. His repeatedly failed exhibitions, the birth of a second child, called Aaron, and the general hostility towards his art, eventually led to tension between the artists and their eviction in 1937. His art Interior with bed, oil on canvas, 310 x 670 mm, Sanlam Art Collection Wolf Kibel is frequently referred to as an expressionist artist, but his expressionism has none of the exuberance of Irma Stern or pastoral qualities of Maggie Laubser. He did not share the revolutionary anger of the original Expressionists and his influences ranged to Matisse, Chagall and Soutine. Like Chagall and Soutine, he was of Eastern European, and exclusively Jewish, extraction. Like Soutine he would employ a painterly approach, with rich impasto and expressive brushmarks. Kibel was a strict formalist and he refused to provide explanations, engage in sales talk or even sign and date his works. He naturally despised exhibitions because of this and it certainly did not endear him to the public or the critics. Yet he was keenly sensitive to human values and this led him to avoid the picturesque, such as the impoverished Malay Quarter in Cape Town, which was, and still is, mined endlessly for saleable pictures. It is also to this that his wife would attribute his admiration of Rembrandt. Nude on Chair, monotype, 229 x 229 mm His sensitivity gave him 'the ability to animate and give inner life to objects normally considered prosaic because of their familiarity'. Freda Kibel was using Interior with bed as an example, in which distortions of perspective are reminiscent of Van Gogh. His skin tones are reminiscent of those of Renoir. Nude Study, oil on canvas on board, 290 x 195 mm, Sanlam Art Collection Kibel was the first to exhibit monotypes in South Africa in numbers, notably at the prestigious 1936 Empire Exhibition in Johannesburg. Working from metal plates, he brought the medium to expressive perfection and respectability as an artform. Final exhibition and illness Kibel had been feeling ill for some time before his exhibition in 1937. He refused to see a doctor, fearing that a negative diagnosis would derail the exhibition. The exhibition contained 45 works, including a tempera portrait of his wife, bought by the South African National Gallery. Melvin Simmers commented on his coloured monotypes in the Cape Times of 24 June 1937: A visit to a physician after the exhibition revealed that he had advanced tuberculosis of the lungs and throat. His health soon collapsed and he was removed to hospital. He received visits from many friends, notably several times a week from artists Cecil Higgs and Maggie Laubser, but succumbed to the disease after ten months, on Wednesday, 29 June 1938.

It is approximately 8 km from district headquarters Jangaon, and neighboring villages include Vadlakonda, Yerragollapahad, Venkiryala, and Marigadi. Village having two connectivity roads towards Maddur and Narmetta The population is approximately 2,637, with 1,700 voting members. The official language of Ganugupahad is Telugu. Ganugupahad is located at 17¬∞47‚Äô20\\"N and 79¬∞08‚Äô21\\" E, and is at an elevation of 425 Metre. The climate is hot and dry with May being the hottest month. The monsoon season follows the summer months and brings most of the annual rainfall. Government The village government consists of a Sarpanch and a village officer. The Sarpanch is elected by the townspeople for a five-year term and serves as the village mayor. The village is divided into ten sections, each headed by a ward member. These ward members also help to elect the Sarpanch. The village officer is appointed by the government. Culture Ganugupahad is a majority Hindu village, with a small percentage of Muslims and Christians. In accordance with Hindu tradition, villagers celebrate the festivals of Ekadhashi, Vinayaka Chavithi, Raksha Bandhan, Dhasara, Diwali, Ugadhi, Sankrathi, and Holi. The Hindu temple in Ganugupahad is called Sri Rajarajeswara Swamy temple and was built at the time of Kakatiya dynasty. Villagers often attend the temple to do Puja, an offering to the gods, and Bajana, ceremonial songs. The historic temple was built many centuries ago. Cuisine The staples of the diet are rice, lentils, and vegetable curries. Curd is also eaten at most meals. Chicken and mutton are prepared on special occasions such as festivals. Much of the food is flavored with turmeric, chili powder, cardamom, curry leaves and coriander. Family Life It is common for multiple generations of families to live together in one house. Marriages are arranged by the individuals' families and generally take place when the woman is between 18 and 22 years old and the man is between 21 and 26 years old. Most women are housewives who clean the home, prepare meals, and take care of the children while the men earn a living for the family. Business and Industry The majority of citizens are farmers and the main crops are Paddy and cotton. While most farmers are men, women play an important role in rice transplanting. Monsoon season, the rainy season in the late summer and early fall months, is the primary season for planting crops. Herders also play an important role in agriculture. It is their responsibility to lead the village water buffalo and goats to pasture each day. Other typical jobs include tailors, toddy tappers, carpenters, drivers, shop keepers, basket weavers, and teachers. Wednesday, 11 January 2017 Transportation Walking is the primary mode of transportation, followed by bicycles, motorcycles, and autos, which are similar to taxis. Villagers typically travel on buses for longer distance trips. Cars and larger vehicles are uncommon in Ganugupahad, but more prosperous families may sometimes have them.

He was a Chilean painter, printmaker and muralist. Education He began his artistic studies at Valparaiso, where he was a disciple of Juan Francisco Gonzalez with whom he learned drawing. Later, he studied Law and Architecture, which he abandoned to join the School of Fine Arts, University of Chile, where he studied with Jose Mercedes Ortega, Fernando Alvarez de Sotomayor, Alberto Valenzuela Llanos, Ricardo Richon-Brunet and Pedro Lira. He was one of the members of Generation 13. Work After gaining recognition for his work and with the money he earned from his first exhibition, he traveled to Europe in 1924 to devote himself to studying the techniques of fresco painting and engraving. Inspired by Paul C√©zanne, he joined the movement for the renewal of French painting and was a great admirer of cubist artists. In Denmark he studied the stained glass technique. On returning to the country in 1927, he was professor of engraving at the School of Fine Arts. He traveled to Europe for the second time with a group of 1928 fellows, as part of the so-called Generation 28. In Spain he became interested in mural painting for which he became known as a prominent cultor and teacher. Upon his return to Chile in 1932 he created the mural painting course at the School of Fine Arts. He taught at this school for over thirty years. In his works he recreated the coastal and rural landscape, still life, portraits and traditional scenes, through pen, ink, chalk, charcoal, oil, watercolor, fresco painting, murals and stained glass. He was noted for the strength of his drawing and recreation of intimate and melancholic atmospheres through a color that characterized Generation Thirteen and which was dominated by pastel and earthy tones. Recognition Among the numerous awards he received during his life, the prize obtained at the Latin American Exhibition in Seville in 1929, shared with Arthur Gordon is the most noteworthy. The winning works are located, from 2001, at the University of Talca. He received the National Art Award given by the Chilean government in 1967.

Career He began writing several lyrical pieces, with one of which in 1919 he staged a show that appeared at the Comedy Theatre, entitled \\"El derrumbe\\" (the collapse). He was not only the creator of the script, but he played the lead role. Two years later, his \\"Malhaya tu coraz√≥n\\" (\\"Curse your heart\\"), repeated the success of his debut feature. He also made his career in Argentina where, in 1922, he married Carmen Moreno Jofr√©. He was a devoted admirer of the heroes of the Independence of Chile, the reason that led him to become a collector patient of whatever object that may be linked to these heroes. One of the specific manifestations of this sentiment was the creation of the Museum of the Patria Vieja, in a central house of Rancagua, where he resided for some years. This museum opened its doors on October 24, 1950. The president at the time, Gabriel Gonz√°lez Videla, and a good set of authorities and respectable neighbors of the city attended its inauguration.

The mutations cause expression of a defective Œ± chain or complete absence thereof, an essential part of high- affinity interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptors. The result is a syndrome described as IPEX-like or a SCID. In one patient, deficiency of CD25 on CD4+ lymphocytes caused significantly impaired sensitivity to IL-2. This was demonstrated by a lack of measurable response in anti-inflammatory interleukin-10 (IL-10) secretion to low-dose IL-2 incubation. Greatly reduced IL-10 secretion compared to healthy humans results in a syndrome comparable to IPEX syndrome, a type of autoimmunity which is caused by FoxP3 transcription factor dysfunction. In addition to IPEX-like symptoms, CD25 deficiency increases susceptibility to viral infections and possibly fungal and bacterial infections. As IL-2 is an important inducer of lymphocyte proliferation, the absence of highly sensitive IL-2 receptors may also significantly hinder activation and clonal expansion of CD8+ and CD4+ lymphocytes and NK cells. One case also reported the absence of CD1, a MHC-like glycoprotein involved in the presentation of lipid antigens to T cells, in a CD25 deficient patient. Furthermore, chronic upregulation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 in thymocytes was also described possibly allowing autoreactive T cells to escape deletion.

Biography Juan S√°nchez Pel√°ez was born in Altagracia de Orituco but his family soon moved to Caracas, where he attended primary and secondary schools. He attended university in Santiago, Chile where he befriended the poets of the surrealist group Mandr√°gora. He published his first poems in their magazine and it was through this encounter that his lifelong interest in surrealism began. Upon returning to Caracas, he published Elena y los elementos in 1951. Elena y los elementos had a profound effect on Venezuelan poetry, outlining a distinctly Venezuelan form of surrealism that influenced the generation of avant-garde poets who emerged in the 1960s. This book was published in a fiftieth anniversary edition by Monte √Åvila Editores after he was awarded the title of Doctor Honoris Causa from the Universidad de los Andes in M√©rida in 2001. He worked as a teacher in Matur√≠n, Maracaibo and the state of Sucre. He was cultural attache to the Embassy of Venezuela in Colombia. He also lived in Paris and Madrid. In 1969 he was a Fellow at The University of Iowa's International Writing Program, after which he lived in New York City for two years. S√°nchez Pel√°ez was a contributor to numerous periodicals: Papel Literario (El Nacional), Zona Franca, Eco (Colombia) Revista Poesia (Valencia), Se√±al (Paris), Tabla Redonda, among others. He also translated the works of American poet laureate Mark Strand from English to Spanish. The outstanding feature of his poetry is the tension between mysticism and eroticism. S√°nchez Pel√°ez always looked at his erotic objects as distant entities, separate from the mundane through the metaphysical veil. Ludovico Silva, in his \\"Juan Sanchez Pelaez, The real and illusionary\\" states: > Juan S√°nchez Pel√°ez was the first Venezuelan poet who introduced into our > poetry, consciousness of the secrecy of man in the world and his distressing > certainty of being thrown into time as a foreigner, without his consent > (...) His existential rebellion is a discerning attitude, a lyrical > excitement, a ritual of introspection. Silent. He accepts the world but does > not understand it and his flexible language, capable of expressing nuances > of a visionary and deeply artistic sensibility, constitutes a > renewal.Escritura, Numero 01, Caracas, Junio 1976, pp.78 Juan S√°nchez Pel√°ez in the Alta Mira neighborhood of Caracas, Venezuela.

He began to be famed not only as a director but also as a composer. He opened many pasodobles, polkas, waltzes, habaneras, mazurkas, etc... which were highly successful and popular. In 1918 he managed to become an Army Major musician, stationed in Santa Cruz de Tenerife. There he directed public concerts with the military band, organized choirs, composed works such as the celebrated Ven, Cyrilla, Icod, pasodoble on canary grounds, El Desfile, El Coronel Mayorga, among others.

After Miguel Yuste died he left the army, becoming Vice director of the Madrid Municipal Band, where he served for over 30 years. He combined this with his work as composer, being the author of works such as Lagartijilla, Marcial, eres el m√°s grande (dedicated to Marcial Lalanda) and Los Dos Adolfos. He became friends with contemporary literature and art personages such as Carlos Arniches, Francisco de Cossio, Jacinto Guerrero, Federico Moreno Torroba, Mariano Benlliure and others.

Career Mar√≠a Simoes worked in the press from his youth, first as a printer and later as a journalist both in the local and national media. In 1922, at age 21, he founded the newspaper La Cachiporra. Fundamentally he was a tireless worker for cultural activities in the belief that the culture of a people is not something that should only be transmitted, but something that is made and remade every day through creativity. He believed that strengthening the culture is the way to participate in the development of peoples. In 1930 his Canto a la ciudad de Rivera (Song to the city of Rivera) took first prize in the competition organized by the Departmental Council of the Municipal Government, being later declared Hymn of the City. As it relates to educational activities Mar√≠a Simoes participated on several school building committees, he was also founder and secretary for 13 years of the Association of Parents of High School Students. He also worked so that Rivera would have its own Normal Institute (Institute for teacher training). He supported the work of the Rivera French Alliance. Achievements In 1936 Olhinto Mar√≠a Simoes founded the first Athenaeum of Rivera, which conducted extensive cultural activities, and he worked in it from the start. He put on drama pieces and also participated in theatre companies when they came to Montevideo to act in the Florencio S√°nchez de Rivera theatre. In 1950, he collected La Sombra de los Pl√°tanos (The Shadow of Bananas) in a book - this poetic production has had several editions. In 1956 he founded the School of Visual Arts Workshop of whose Steering Committee he was president until his death.

He was born in Fuente del Carnero, Zamora in 1781 and died in 1849. Education and career C√°ceres studied in Valladolid and later got his medical degree in Salamanca. He also served in the military. But he was, above all, a teacher. C√°ceres was a man of liberal and progressive interests and as a result was exiled in London for 10 years (1823-1833). He carried out the first implementation of the liberal education system and generalized many ideas proposed by other prominent teachers. He was the first principal of the Escuelas Normales, and his ideas were widely circulate. He focused on early childhood education, having observed the educational situation in London, and also set about proper teacher training. When he returned to Spain he established the Sociedad para mejorar la educaci√≥n del pueblo (Society for improving the education of the people), and following this he founded the first kindergarten school in 1838 in Madrid. He later created another such school that would bear his name. In 1839, he took part in the primary education reform, proposing the adoption of kindergarten schools and improved female education. One of his best known works was Manual para maestros de la escuela de P√°rvulos in 1840 (Handbook for kindergarten teachers). This work included all his educational ideas, and was the first theoretical framework introduced in Spain. Accomplishments From 1836, with the Duke of Rivas' Plan de Instrucci√≥n P√∫blica (Plan of Public Instruction), the then newly formed liberal bourgeois government began to take steps to set up an educational model that suited their economic, ideological and political interests, following the basic tenets of the bourgeois liberal pedagogy. The main objective of this action was the construction of a national education system as was done in other European countries. For social and educational reasons, it was also necessary to meet the educational needs of younger children, through the establishment of kindergartens. For this purpose it was necessary to provide adequate training for teachers in special schools. The proper functioning of the system also required the creation of an inspectorate that would supervise, guide and advise teachers, while providing the necessary information to the government. Pablo Montesinos played a key role in designing the programmes and the processes of implementation of the actions undertaken to achieve these ends. One of C√°ceres' greatest accomplishments throughout his career was his work in the Escuelas Normales. The Escuelas Normales emerged in Spain in the forties and were primarily concerned with teacher training. Pablo Montesino, in 1843 delineated what teachers were to become and accordingly reorganized the Escuelas Normales. Many of these centers experienced an initial period of uncertainty during which they would not function as Escuelas Normales except in name only. For Paul Montesino there were only two ways to get a good teacher: either improve teacher quality through the creation of Escuelas Normales or impose an obligation to provide them good training. Pablo Montesino considered the first option the more natural, easy and fair. 1849 deaths 1791 births Spanish academics People from the Province of Zamora University of Salamanca alumni ","title":"Pablo Montesino C√°ceres"},{"id":"34244739","text":"The Rehabilitation Trauma Center (RTC) at the Santa Clara Valley Medical Center (SCVMC) was founded in 1972 and is part of the only federally designated spinal cord injury center in Northern California.

The main idea was to raise awareness about the rights of the working masses. It was performed by a cast of amateurs, where the protagonist was himself the author of the work. Other diverse works are to be added to the above lists as they have come to light in the Asuncion, Buenos Aires, Montevideo and Rio de Janeiro press. Journalistic career In the press, Ramos Gim√©nez directed several newspapers and magazines. In 1913 he founded and directed the fortnightly magazine \\"New Era\\" and \\"Prometheus\\" in the following year. This would be one of the several vocalizers of organized labor in Paraguay. He founded, along with P. Alejandro Islas the weekly Acci√≥n Paraguaya (Paraguayan Action) which was widely publicized, but unfortunately short lived. Its main purpose was to defend the interests of Paraguay on the occasion of the peace conference whose deliberations were met at that time in the late 1920s. During 1925 Numancia, Patria, Paraguay and Progreso Nacional were created. In 1930 he edited \\"Journal of the Military Health System: Annals of Paraguay.\\" In 1929 he founded the newspaper El Censor and \\"La Uni√≥n, the latter again in 1933. In 1934 he created the newspapers: Uni√≥n Nacional and Estrella. He founded, in 1940, the Compa√±√≠a Editorial Paraguaya (Paraguayan Publishing Company), successor to the Compa√±√≠a Editora Nacional (National Publishing Company), also created by him. Political career Ramos Gim√©nez was a great promoter of the labor movement and trade unionism in Paraguay. He was strongly influenced by the life and works of Raphael Barret and Jos√© William Bertotto, influences which would later be revealed in his various journalistic and literary productions, supporting social causes via these means. Just as those fought and ensured the rights of the proletariat, Ramos Gim√©nez has always been closely linked to these efforts. He founded, on December 3, 1914, along with Rufino Recalde Milesi and several others (among them probably Libre Jara), el Partido Obrero (the Workers Party), which later, in 1918, was renamed the Partido Socialista Revolucionario (the Socialist Revolutionary Party). He was also a proponent of \\"Centro Regional Workers of Paraguay\\" along with Rufino Recalde Milesi, Cayetano Raimundi Soler Ignacio Nunez and many others. Due to his critical and fierce reasoning, but justified opposition, he was shot, becoming the victim of social struggle. Fortunately the attack was not fatal so he was able to slowly recover.

He was the father of Till Lindemann, the lead vocalist of German industrial metal band Rammstein.  Life  Werner Lindemann was born into a family of farm-workers. He grew up in Alt-Je√ünitz Gutsdorf near Wolfen in Saxony-Anhalt. In 1941, aged 15, he was apprenticed to a farmer. Between 1943 and 1945, he served in the German Army. After the end of World War II, he studied natural sciences at Halle. In 1949, he began to teach agriculture- related subjects at a vocational school. Between 1955 and 1957, he studied at the Johannes R. Becher Institute of Literature at Leipzig. There, he worked as editor of the student magazine Forum, became director of the city House of Culture, and from 1959, worked as a freelance writer. He co-founded the K√ºnstlerkolonie Drispeth (\\"Drispeth Artist's Colony\\"), where he lived for over 20 years, along with Joachim Seyppel, Joochen Laabs, and Gerhard and Christa Wolf. Lindemann wrote his first poems shortly after the war. They were published in a 1959 book Stationen, which also included autobiographical material. The writer became known in the 1970s with his children's books, which showed a poetic vision of the everyday. In addition to his children's poetry, from the 1980s, he published several books of prose, such as Aus dem Drispether Bauernhaus (\\"From the farmhouse at Drispeth\\") and The Roggenmuhme. These and other books were based on observations and memories of his youth. He describes nature, family life in the countryside, and day-to-day life under the socialist regime. For example, in the book Mike Oldfield im Schaukelstuhl: Notizen eines Vaters (\\"Mike Oldfield in the Rocking Chair: Notes of a Father\\"), Lindemann contrasted the memories of the narrator, a parent, the views and ambitions of his son; the book remarked on the differences of character among educated people in different social systems, but also showed their similarities. On many occasions, he gave talks in schools to bring poetry to children. He was a frequent visitor to the Grundschule Elisabethwiese elementary school in Rostock. After his death, the school changed its name to Werner-Lindemann-Grundschule on October 7, 1994. The ceremony was attended by his widow, journalist Gitta Lindemann. In 1985, the Academy of Arts in Berlin was awarded him the Alex-Wedding-Preis, for his merits in the field of socialist children's literature.

Education and exile Tom√°s de Salas studied law in Madrid and obtained a PhD in Economic History at La Sorbonne in Paris. During his youth he also showed enthusiasm for journalism and interest in political activism. He began to engage in anti-Francoist activities, and in 1961 joined the Free Spanish Press Agency, associated with the People's Liberation Front. In 1962, when police arrested nearly a hundred members of the organization, de Salas had to seek political asylum. He managed to take refuge in the embassy of Colombia in Spain, and moved to Bogot√°. In Colombia he started working with the newspaper El Tiempo, and that is where he seriously began to be involved in journalism. In 1966 he moved to France to work at France Press, and in 1969 to London, where he worked for the Spanish version of The Economist. That same year he was allowed to return to Spain when he was acquitted. Career Chambers founded in 1971, along with 15 other journalists and media professionals the weekly Cambio 16. Under Francoist Spain, the magazine focused on issues of \\"Economy and Society\\", and after Franco's death, became a magazine of general information, which achieved great prominence during the Spanish Transition. The success of the publication led him to found a general newspaper called Diario 16, which was released on 18 October 1976. During 1980, the good sales of his two publications led him to form a media conglomerate. He created Grupo 16, under which magazines like Motor 16 or Marie Claire were also released. However, during the 1990 publications went through a serious crisis, led by the poor economic performance of Diario 16. This crisis ended with the sale or even closure of almost all the magazines within his group. Diario 16 began bankruptcy proceedings in 1997 and Juan Tom√°s left the group entirely. In 1998 he launched the satirical weekly El gato encerrado, but it failed for lack of funding and De Salas gave up all entrepreneurial activities. For the rest of his life he continued to publish opinion pieces in various publications.

He became Chief Executive of the National Offender Management Service in 2010 (later renamed HM Prison and Probation Service), retiring in 2019. Early life Spurr graduated from St Chad's College, Durham University with a BA in Economics and Economic History. At the time of graduating from University, he was running a youth club, and following the suggestion of his careers advisor to look at the prison service, he felt that becoming a borstal house master would be a good idea, and so signed up. Career Spurr joined the Prison Service in 1983, the same year that borstals were abolished, initially as a prison officer in HMP Leeds. He then moved to HMP Stanford Hill to begin training as an Assistant Governor after a year. Following the completion of his training he transferred to HMP Swaleside, before becoming Deputy Governor of HMYOI Aylesbury and then Governing Governor of the same establishment in 1993. His subsequent career included posts of Governing Governor at Wayland and Norwich prisons, Area Manager of Eastern Region, and various posts in HQ, before becoming Deputy Director General of the Prison Service in 2006. Following the reorganisation of the National Offender Management Service (NOMS) in 2008, he took on the role of Chief Operating Officer, with responsibility for delivery of operations for prisons and probation. He became Chief Executive of NOMS on 8 June 2010. Spurr was appointed Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in the 2014 Birthday Honours for services to offender management. Spurr's time in office was marked by sharp deterioration in many prisons. Assaults and self harm more than doubled (Ministry of Justice 'Safer custody statistics'). In 2017‚Äì18, 1 in 8 prisons were rated as causing serious concern (Ministry of Justice, 'Annual Prison Performance Ratings 2017-18). A new procedure for the Chief Inspector to send an urgent notification of severe problems to the Secretary of State was introduced in November 2017, and was used 4 times in a year. Against this background, in 2018 Spurr was told to step down by the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Justice, Richard Heaton, who said he felt a new direction was needed. However most observers commented that these problems were the result of Ministerial decisions, not his leadership - particularly, the decision to cut operational staff in prisons by almost a third while not reducing prisoner numbers, and to cut starting pay for officers thus making recruitment and retention more difficult. A former Lord Chancellor commented: \\"Michael Spurr is a terrific impressive decent public servant who has given his working life to prison and probation, and has been dealt as shitty a hand by the government as it is possible to deal\\".

Early years Martina Barros Borgo√±o was born in Santiago on 6 July 1850. She was the eldest daughter of Manuel Barros Arana, brother of the historian Diego Barros Arana, and Eugenia Borgo√±o Vergara, daughter of Gen. Jos√© Manuel Borgo√±o N√∫√±ez, winner of the loyalist resistance in Chilo√©. Along with her brothers Manuel (1852‚Äì1903), Louis (1858‚Äì1943) and Victor grew up in the house of her paternal grandfather, Diego Antonio Barros Fern√°ndez de Leiva (1789‚Äì1853), until the death of her father. Then, she moved to her historian uncle's house, located in the old street of the Capuchins (now Rosas), where she acquired an education in keeping with the intellectual and refined environment of her tutor. Education Martina studied at different private schools in Santiago. In 1853 she joined the Rafaela Fern√°ndez's school and later the Miss Whitelock's school. Years later she admitted not having learned much in those schools, which she left at 11 years of age. Her greatest source of education was her uncle Diego, as she herself would say in her memoirs, entitled Memories of My Life: > in my case, I owe my work to my uncle Diego that took care of me while I was > single, I think it would not have been possible to find a better teacher ... > [my education] I also owe to my own initiative, my thirst for knowledge, my > admiration for superior talent, which has been one of the characteristics of > my life.Barros de Orrego, Martina. Recuerdos de mi Vida. Santiago: Orbe, > 1942  Publishing controversy  Martina became known in 1872, at age 22 when she published a translation of the book The Subjection of Women (1869), by the English philosopher and political economist John Stuart Mill (1806-1873), with the title The Bondage of Women. Her translation was in the Santiago Journal, founded by Fanor Velasco and Augusto Orrego Luco (1849-1933), whom she married in 1874. This publication, a pioneer in its day, included a very controversial prologue, by the same Orrego Luco, her then-boyfriend, who produced, paradoxically, a pleasant reaction in the liberal male circles of his time. Her translation, however, received an overwhelming rejection by women who saw her as a \\"dangerous girl,' as she writes in her memoir, deciding not to publish it. Despite this, and since then, the equality of women became Martina's main objective. Social connections Martina was able to meet many influential people of the time since, as a result of her relatives who held prominence in public life - her husband, her brother Luis, Alessandri Palma contender in the 1920 elections, and her aunt Julia Borgo√±o Vergara, married to Admiral Patricio Lynch. These added a long list of social relations that she and her family carefully tended. Thus, in her long life, in addition to having two camps in her home - a political one, through her husband, and a literary one, on her part, she cultivated the friendship of the Amun√°tegui Aldunate, Ram√≥n Barros Luco, Manuel Blanco Encalada brothers, the Blest Gana, Jos√© Victorino Lastarria and Santander, Pedro Lira Rencoret, Enrique Mac Iver Rodr√≠guez brothers, the Matta Goyenechea, Ram√≥n Sotomayor Vald√©s, Jos√© Tom√°s Urmeneta and Garc√≠a-Abello brothers, and the Benjam√≠n Vicu√±a Mackenna and Joaqu√≠n Walker Mart√≠nez brothers. She also had the opportunity to socialize with the Chilean presidents from Manuel Montt Torres to Arturo Alessandri Palma. She interracted with the foreigners Jean Gustave Courcelle-Seneuil, Ignacio Domeyko, Claude Gay and Rudolf Philippi. She also enjoyed the personal friendship of the then exiled Argentines and later presidents, Bartolom√© Mitre and Domingo Faustino Sarmiento as well as the former Peruvian president Manuel Pardo. Her work Also, her active social and intellectual life put her in touch with other women with similar concerns. In 1917, she was invited to the Club of Ladies by Delia Matte P√©rez, president of the association, where, in the first meeting, she gave a lecture on women's suffrage, an issue almost unprecedented for those times. There, Martina said \\"we have said, and repeated a lot, that we are not prepared for this ... Without any preparation we give ourselves into marriage, to be mothers, which is the largest of our duties, and for that neither the church nor the law, neither parents nor her husband require from us anything but the will to accept it.\\" While her work is not extensive, the life told in her memoirs makes allusions to the need for women's liberation, not with a separatist or egalitarian spirit, but rather to contribute to the progress of Chile.

He worked in different mining companies, such as \\"Sota Aznar\\" and the \\"Spanish Mining Company of San Juan\\" in Melilla. In that city he developed his first patent: the rotary engine registered under no. 61714, the first of more than five hundred which he managed to produce throughout his life. Career The workshop in Barcelona In 1918 Jos√© Art√©s de Arcos moved to Barcelona, where he worked in a company that was dedicated to the repair of ship engines. Following a major repair, his remuneration helped him establish himself, in 1927, in a small auto repair shop. In 1929, he was living in a small wooden loft installed on the premises of his industry, located in Corsica Street. The name Art√©s can still be seen on the bumper of His Majesty King Alfonso XIII's car. The fuel economizer and the intake speakers Among other inventions are the gas economizer which became the most famous and productive of his patents, and the intake horn, which was soon copied by the majority of countries. He held a demonstration of this invention by attaching it to a car and touring Spain on a promotional tour, to the astonishment of the inhabitants of towns and cities on seeing a set of ten note loudspeakers playing regional music. That journey ended in the courtyard of the Palacio de Oriente, which he entered playing the Royal March, and shortly afterwards on the Champs Elysees in Paris at the Motor Show, playing the Marseillaise. Over the years, his business has occupied an important place in the world of ancillary automotive industries, being awarded the Silver Medal of Merit for his work in 1965. Business career In 1972 in a memoir Art√©s de Arcos wrote: > \\"Like so many others I also had to leave home and my people (Alhama de > Almer√≠a), and like so many, I headed for the highly industrial region, > industrious and intelligent, Catalonia, where work together with studies in > the hours that belonged to rest, the sum struggle for life, for long, long > years, has been crowned with success, not through easy business nor via > lotteries, let alone through human exploitation, but by creating innovations > that the public consumer paid for handsomely, like a caprice, my own > inventions that have gone around the world and have been copied in all the > industrialized countries.\\" In Barcelona, for his performance as a member of the Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Navigation, plus the work done for its producers, building them two groups of 60 homes among other social benefits, and at their request, the Government granted Art√©s de Arcos the title of Business Model. Recognition Joseph Art√©s de Arcos was named Honorary Citizen of the town of Arenys de Munt, plus given the Gold Medal of the City for his achievements there. He was also granted a street, and a plaque commemorating the electrification of the District of Sobirans, Catalonia, which he paid in full, benefiting the whole neighborhood. Years later, for unexplained reasons, this was the only village where these recognitions were withdrawn. He was also named Favourite Son of the town of Alhama de Almeria, which granted him a street and erected a monument in his memory for the accomplishments that he contributed to his hometown, such as the recovery of the San Nicolas spa, the waters, both for private use at the spa, as well as public use. In Barcelona, for his work as a member of the Chamber of Commerce Industry and Shipping, plus the work done for their producers, building them two groups of 60 homes and other social benefits, and at their request, the Government granted the title of Enterprise model. Manufacturing career As an entrepreneur, Jos√© Art√©s de Arcos founded his own company, called Jos√© Art√©s de Arcos SA, a pioneer in Spain in the field of automotive industry supplies, as a manufacturer of lights, speakers, board boxes, flyers, among others. He introduced the French multinational, Jaeger, into Spain, forming the Art√©s-Jaeger company, whose production halls were found in Barber√† del Vall√®s, Barcelona Province. In this company all automotive electronic parts from different European brands were made. Art√©s de Arcos also brought the French headlights manufacturing company, Cibie, to Spain with which he formed a company called PASA. This time he took advantage of the industrialization plans of southern Spain, building the factory in Martos, Ja√©n province. Jos√© Arcos Art√©s S.A. had production facilities in Barcelona, Madrid and Almeria, from which it supplied to automotive manufacturers. External links *Obituary published in El Pa√≠s.

Archetti or more affectionately Lali Archetti (Santiago del Estero, April 12, 1943 ‚Äì Oslo, June 6, 2005) was an Argentine anthropologist and sociologist, essayist and educator, considered one of the most original social scientists in Latin America. He was a pioneer of the anthropological approach to sports and its relationship to the collective imagination. He died of cancer in Norway, while still the director of the Department of Social Anthropology at the University of Oslo. Education Archetti was born in the province of Santiago del Estero on 12 April 1943. His father was a doctor. He studied at the Military School ‚ÄúGeneral Paz‚Äù in C√≥rdoba and completed his secondary education at the Absal√≥n Rojas School in 1960. He later pursued studies at the University of Buenos Aires. He began to study law but only spent three years. He became interested in sociology, getting acquainted with Gino Germani, Juan Carlos Portantiero and Eliseo Ver√≥n. He graduated in 1967. He then travelled to Paris.http://www.unse.edu.ar/trabajoysociedad/InMemoriam.pdf He into the Practical School of Advanced Studies (la √âcole Pratique des Hautes √âtudes). During this time he took courses with Claude L√©vi-Strauss and Maurice Godelier and was introduced to social anthropology. Interested in studying the rural phenomenon in Latin America, he attempted to realize his doctoral thesis in Cuba. He, however, did not receive the subsidy nor authorization from the Cuban government. He decided on the northern Santa F√© province, Argentina. He was based in the Friulian colonies which produced cotton in the region. Supervised by Godelier, he completed his investigation and presented his doctoral thesis entitled 'Economy and trade union organization among colonists in Northern Santa Fe, Argentina' in 1976. The military coup hastened his return to Europe. He defended his thesis at the University of Oslo and was designated Research Fellow in the Department of Anthropology.  Work  Archetti was a founding member of the European Association of Social Anthropologists. However, his interest in Latin America would remain the focus of his work. He developed a masters program in Rural Sociology at FLACSO-Quito and was a consultant to the World Bank in Zambia, Burkina Faso and Ecuador. He produced his famous study on the guinea pig, which analyzed the relationship between culture, identity and development. With the return to democracy, he resumed his research in Argentina. He developed an anthropological approach to the world of football, polo, tango and motorsport. According to Archetti: > The national identity of Argentines was formed by polo players, football > players and dancers of tango, which early in the century represented us > abroad (...) the importance of the export of meat and grains is always > spoken of, but they were not the most important commodities, if we consider > that the music and sports idols were the ones who created the romantic image > that people overseas had of the Argentines.

Her work was directed mainly at improving the situation of Latin American women and women's suffrage in Chile. She was born Pinto Sep√∫lveda in Santiago, Chile, on December 5, 1886. Labarca's parents were Onofre Pinto Perez de Arce and Sabina Sepulveda. She adopted her husband's two surnames, Labarca Hubertson, after her marriage to Guillermo Labarca Hubertson during a trip to the U.S., amongst protest from her family. Education She received her early education at a school on San Isidro Street, in Santiago, and then continued her education at the Isabel Le Brun de Pinochet Lyceum. She obtained a BA in Humanities in 1902. In 1905 she graduated as a teacher of the State with a concentration in Castilian, graduating from the Pedagogical Institute of the University of Chile. In 1910 she traveled with her husband to the U.S. to continue her studies at Columbia University, and in 1912, in France at the Sorbonne University to major in education. Career In 1915 when Labarca was still a student, she organized the Reading Circle inspired by the Reading Clubs of America. This organization allowed her to bring education and culture to women regardless of their status, who at that time were excluded. From the Reading Circle she developed the National Council of Women in 1919, participating in it with Celinda Reyes. In 1922 she obtained the position of Extraordinary Professor of Psychology at the Faculty of Philosophy, Humanities and Education at the University of Chile. She joined the Radical Party as a militant. In 1922 she presented a project for improving the civil, political and legal rights of women, which were restricted in the Civil Code of Chile (a struggle that would continue until the end of the century). In 1925 she helped achieve the adoption of a legal decree known as the Maza Law (named after Senator Jos√© Maza) in the Civil Code that restricted the powers of custody of the father in favor of the mother. It enabled women to testify before the law, and authorized married women to manage the fruits of their labor. As an educator she promoted the creation of the Experimental Manuel de Salas Lyceum for the training of future teachers in 1932. She was a founder of the National Committee for Women's Rights, created in 1933, along with Elena Caffarena and other women. She was appointed ambassador in 1946, by the government of President Gabriel Gonz√°lez Videla, as the representative of Chile to the United Nations and head of the Status of Women section. She was also a literary critic and a writer, dealing especially with the role of women in society. She directed the Reading Circle newspaper, the Women's Action, which had outstanding participation in the struggle for women's suffrage and fighting bribery (the sale of votes). As a result, in 1944, she was elected president of the Chilean Federation of Feminine Institutions. She established Summer Schools at the University of Chile. She taught courses and seminars in countries throughout the Americas. In 1964 she was honored as an Academic Member of the Faculty of Education at the University of Chile, and, in 1969, the Academy of Political Science, Sociology and Morals at the Chilean Institute. Legacy and recognition She died in Santiago on January 2, 1975, at 88 years of age. Her legacy remains in many publications in favor of women's rights and education issues. She was the first Latin American woman to pursue a university professorship. She wrote numerous books on education and feminism. In 1976, the University of Chile founded the Amanda Labarca Award in her memory, designed to recognize the merits of a college woman once a year.

He was born in San Sebastian, Spain on March 17, 1703 and died in Florence, Grand Duchy of Tuscany on September 21, 1772. His father was an Irish merchant, who had settled in the Basque city. Biography At 14, he and his brother Daniel joined the Society of Jesus. In 1736 he went on to profess the Society's vows in San Sebastian. He became a professor of philosophy at the University of Santiago and professor of theology at the universities of Salamanca and Valladolid. He eventually returned to the Jesuit community in his hometown. Following the expulsion of the Jesuits in 1767 he went into exile along with his companions, dying a few years later, on September 21, 1772, in Florence at 69 years of age. In his hometown, San Sebastian, a square, the Father Meagher/Aita Meagher Plaza was dedicated to his memory in 1994. Works Literary works Besides teaching, Father Meagher also produced prose and poetry. There is evidence that he produced various writings but most of them were lost following the expulsion of the Jesuits in 1767 which involved the loss of many of the company's writings. Among his works the following are cited: *Poems about the canonization of Saint Aloysius Gonzaga and Saint Stanislaus Kostka in 1726. *Satirical verses on Friar Gerund of Campazas, fictional character created by Father Isla in 1758. *A funeral elegy of Barbara de Braganza, queen consort of King Ferdinand VI of Spain, who died in 1758. *Writings in defense against several defamatory books against the Jesuits, published in France between 1760 and 1761. *Briefs on various issues which occurred in the 17th century. ;One of Meagher's verses :Gizon bat ardo gabe :Dago erdi hila :Marmar dabiltzak tripak :Ardoaren bila :Baina edan ezkero :Ardoa txit ongi :Gizonik txatarrenak :Balio ditu bi ;Translation :A man without wine :is half dead :the guts go growling :looking for wine :But once drank :wine is very good :the man most useless :sorry for the two External links *Entry on Domingo Patricio Meagher in the Au√±amendi Encyclopaedia The Basque language Father Meagher managed to fill a small gap in the history of Basque literature, having preserved the language in several poems written in Basque. These managed to retain its popularity and were transcribed in songbooks and magazines during the nineteenth and first half of the twentieth. It is told that Meagher, recovering from an illness, was taking wine as a prescription to relieve his ailments. Meagher was able to recover from the illness and, grateful for the relief he had found in wine, wrote some verses in which he praised the qualities of wine. Meagher's poems in Basque all deal with the same theme, for this they can be described as Basque poetry: *Ardo zarraren kantak seikotan - (Songs about old wine in sextets). *Ardoa o Ni naiz txit gauza goxoa - ( Wine or I'm a very sweet thing). *Erroman eta Parisen o Matsaren zumua - (In Rome and Paris or Grape juice). *Ardoari, Zortziokoa ardoari o Gizon bar ardo bage - ( Wine, an Octet to wine or A man without wine). 1703 births 1772 deaths Basque-language writers Basque writers Spanish Jesuits People from San Sebasti√°n Basque-language poets University of Salamanca faculty University of Valladolid faculty ","title":"Domingo Patricio Meagher"},{"id":"34244936","text":"Alfredo Woodward T√©llez (1905‚Äì1988) was a Mexican businessman, politician and member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party.

He was born in C√≥rdoba, in the Viceroyalty of Rio de la Plata, and died in San Juan, Argentina on August 22, 1841. Biography √Ålvarez was the son of Francisco Javier √Ålvarez, a trader based in C√≥rdoba but who was a native of Santiago de Casardeita, Galicia, Spain, and Do√±a Francisca Carlota de las Casas y Pabon. He married Mercedes Allende Goycoechea in 1838. She was the daughter of the influential Jose Norberto de Allende. √Ålvarez studied law in his hometown and became a lawyer at the University of San Carlos. In 1814 he joined the Northern Army, with which he participated in the third auxiliary expedition to Upper Peru. He fought in the Battle of Sipe-Sipe, where he was taken prisoner. He managed to escape and return to C√≥rdoba. He later participated in the war against the federal province of Santa Fe and participated in the Arequito mutiny. For many years he was Member of parliament for C√≥rdoba, as a member of the federal party. Military career In 1839, under the government of Manuel Lopez, alias Quebracho, he became president of the C√≥rdoba legislature. He secretly joined the local branch - of the May Association, which was composed mostly of young romantics, dedicated to fighting what they deemed to be the excessive influence of the governor of the province of Buenos Aires, Juan Manuel de Rosas, and Lopez. In October 1840, the Coalition forces in the North, under General Lamadrid invaded C√≥rdoba from the northwest, while Juan Lavalle was heading there from Santa Fe to avoid being caught between two fronts. Lopez went to the province Southeast, where he thought he would meet the federal army of Manuel Oribe. Taking advantage of his absence and the proximity of Lamadrid, the unit organized a coup and deposed officials and federal legislators. The incoming government named Alvarez incumbent governor. He appointed Colonel Jose Julian Martinez as his minister. The day after the revolution Lamadrid arrived to C√≥rdoba, and Alvarez was appointed commander of the provincial army. But this army was greatly diminished because most of the provincial forces had accompanied Lopez. On the other hand, the commanders who were sufficiently far from the capital's government ignored Alvarez. Alvarez did not have time to govern. He just managed to start levying a compulsory contribution from the federals and confiscated some of Lopez's assets, and also withdrew the delegation of foreign relations in Rosas. He served the government for just over two months, but his attention was focused on war. He had to ask for help from the other provinces, since the entire war front was in the province of C√≥rdoba. In early December news came of the virtual destruction of the Lavalle army in the Battle of Quebracho Herrado, and the defeated soldiers caused all kinds of disorders. So Alvarez delegated the government to Lamadrid. Lamadrid decided, according to Lavalle, but without consulting Alvarez, to retreat with his armies to Tucum√°n and La Rioja, respectively. Alvarez decided not to stay in the Oribe province and went in the Lavalle army. A little later, discouraged by the turmoil he saw in it, he went to Lamadrid, whom he accompanied to Tucuman. San Juan battle √Ålvarez participated in the Lamadrid campaign to San Juan, in the vanguard under General Mariano Acha. He fought in the bloody Battle of Angaco, which was a surprising victory over the far superior army led by Mendozan warlord Jos√© F√©lix Aldao. Unfortunately √Ålvarez accompanied Acha in turning to celebrate the victory, just at a time when the San Juan Governor, Nazario Benav√≠dez had reorganized his army on the outskirts of San Juan. On August 18, Benavidez suddenly attacked the city in the Battle of La Chacarilla taking Acha's army by surprise. However, the unit tried to hold out against an army far superior without trenches or defenses. √Ålvarez led a bayonet and gun attack by one of the main streets, and was shattered by a cannon shot. A few hours later, Acha surrendered and his entire army disappeared into the hands of the governor Benavidez. Bibliography *Bischoff, Efra√≠n, Historia de C√≥rdoba, Ed. Plus Ultra, Bs.

Biography He was a son of Jose Riquelme Orozco, the first Chilean stenographer, and Bruna Garcia Venegas, a professor of music. He was the younger brother of Ernesto Riquelme. In 1865, his father died and his mother took over his education. He studied at the National Institute of Santiago, then law at the University of Chile, although he subsequently abandoned his studies. He began as a writer on various topics in Santiago magazines, and then devoted himself to journalism. In 1876 he entered public service, serving as auxiliary official of the Ministry of Finance under the government of President An√≠bal Pinto. As public functionary he was part of an integrated civilian entourage that accompanied the Chilean Army during the War of the Pacific, and he used his stay at the war front to work as a correspondent for El Heraldo of Valparaiso, a newspaper that published his articles from November 1880 until June 1881. In 1885 he published Military Chascarillos, or Military Jokes, which recounted his experiences at the front, dealing with topics such as jokes, table manners and various stories. The book was edited, enhanced and then republished in the work that made him most famous, Under the tent (1888). From 1887 to 1891, Riqueme wrote stories, chronicles and articles under the pseudonym with which he popularly became known: Innocent Conchal√≠. During this period his works included his urban portraits of bohemian Santiago in the late nineteenth century, in particular around the Orphans, Merced and Recoleta streets, where he spent much of his life. His writings combined nascent modernism techniques with the metaphors and sayings drawn from the local Creole. This contributed to Chilean prose of the nineteenth century, and was adopted by later writers including Baldomero Lillo and Olegario Lazo Baeza. After the fall of President Jos√© Manuel Balmaceda, Riquelme continued to work as a writer periodically, but abandoned his light and adorned style of writing to instead engage in works on various historical events, a task that continued during his years at the El Mercurio of Santiago until 1911. Sick with tuberculosis, Riqueme traveled to Paris and then moved to Switzerland. He died in Lausanne in 1912, and his remains were interred there until 1942, when they were thrown into a common grave. At present, the precise location of his remains is unknown. Work In addition to his work on the War of the Pacific, Riquelme portrayed the political and social life of Santiago in the late nineteenth century through articles on folklore, chronicles of the day, and various tales and short stories. In the latter stage of his career as an author, he wrote extensively on history, and he proposed a rereading of some of the foundational accounts of Chile. * Military Chascarillos (1885) * Under The Tent (1888) * The Revolution of April 20, 1851 (1893) * The Church of the Company Fire: December 8, 1863 (1893) * Compendium of the History of Chile (1899) * The earthquake Mr. May (1905) See also * Chilean literature 1857 births 1912 deaths Chilean male writers People from Santiago ","title":"Daniel Riquelme"},{"id":"34244960","text":"Location Park management in Karow Landscape near Lohmen Tourist sign on the A 19 The Nossentiner/Schwinzer Heath Nature Park () lies in the western part of the Mecklenburg Lake District in the districts of Mecklenburgische Seenplatte, Rostock and Ludwigslust-Parchim in the north German state of Mecklenburg- Vorpommern.

He was born in Alcozauca de Guerrero, Guerrero State on May 17, 1924 and died in Tlapa de Comonfort, Guerrero State on December 4, 2008. Education The son of parents who operated a bakery, Oth√≥n worked from an early age, but also went to school. In 1942, Oth√≥n started attending the Oaxtepec Normal School. There, the teachers saw the last flashes of the Mexican Revolution, leaving them with many social concerns. He completed only the first year in Oaxtepec. He did his second year in the Ayotzinapa Rural Teachers' College and the third at the National Teachers College. Afterwards he entered the Superior Normal School, where he studied for four years. There he specialized in social sciences to prepare him to teach civics. Activism In 1954 Oth√≥n was an instrumental leader in the first strike of the Normal Superior. In 1956, when leaders of the Sindicato Nacional de Trabajadores de la Educaci√≥n (SNTE) (National Association of Workers in Education) negotiated a wage increase which was not even half of what was initially demanded, Oth√≥n convened a protest rally. Shortly afterwards, an independent assembly elected him as representative to form the basis for the Movimiento Revolucionario del Magisterio (MRM) (Revolutionary Teachers Movement) which was formed in late 1957 and whose presence in the Federal District's elementary schools was expanding. The following year MRM was at the forefront of one of the largest teachers' struggles. The demonstrations that were organized were attended by a broad social sector. Government, in order to suppress them, as was done with the April 12, 1958 march, fostered social discontent that was simmering for years. While authorities refused to recognize the MRM, its capacity to convene became increasingly effective and, on April 30 teachers took the offices of the Secretar√≠a de Educaci√≥n P√∫blica (SEP) (Ministry of Education), forcing the government to negotiate. In August, in a parallel congress, teachers in Mexico City elected Oth√≥n as their legitimate representative, but with this gesture of trade union autonomy the government's position was hardening. ;Arrest :The demonstration on September 8 was suppressed, and Oth√≥n apprehended. Officers arrived at his home early, tied and blindfolded him. They then subjected him to harsh interrogation and demanded that he confess how many rubles he was receiving from the Soviet Union. He was held hostage for nine days before processing. He was accused of social dissolution, was imprisoned in Lecumberri, but thanks :to large demonstrations for his freedom, he remained there only three days. In the year 1958, a year of great labor unrest, the MRM teachers were among the main protagonists. That same year the protests of the telegraph operators, tankers, and railroad workers shocked the country. The struggles had their origins in economic demands, but their desire for union democracy had much wider implications, and shook the structures of the Partido Revolucionario Institucional PRI (Or in English: The Institutional Revolutionary Party). Workers showed their dissatisfaction with working conditions that the statistics on miraculous economic growth concealed. The government managed to defeat these movements that proposed democratizing the system. But the participants who remained engaged in keeping alive the popular causes could not be silenced. Oth√≥n continued his struggle in teaching, and in 1960, he participated in another strike at the National Teachers College. This action was repressed and Oth√≥n was fired for his role in the protests. Political career After being fired, Oth√≥n lived in a precarious economic situation, aggravated by his advanced age. He eventually returned to Alcozauca, his native village in Guerrero, and toured the region of Monta√±a, listening to and advising those who were organized there. In 1980 he ran for governor of Guerrero for the Mexican Communist Party, becoming Mayor of this municipality (1987-1990).

It uses PCI Express as a data transfer interface. The format is targeted at high-definition camcorders and high- resolution digital cameras. It offers target read and write speeds from 1 Gbit/s (0.125 GB/s) to about 4 Gbit/s (0.5 GB/s) and storage capabilities beyond 2 TB. The cards are not backward compatible with CompactFlash or CFast cards. XQD and CFast were both designed as a replacement of the then-16-year- old (in 2010) CompactFlash standard. The format was first announced in November 2010 by SanDisk, Sony and Nikon, and was immediately picked up by the CompactFlash Association for development. The final specification was announced in December 2011. XQD version 2.0 was announced in June 2012, featuring support for PCI Express 3.0 with transfer rates up to 8 Gbit/s (1 GB/s). History and support In January 2012, the first XQD card was announced by Sony, declaring a 1 Gbit/s read and write speed. In July 2012, Lexar (owned at the time by Micron) announced plans to support the XQD format. As of 2012, SanDisk and Kingston had not announced plans to produce XQD cards. In addition to Sony, as of August 2018, Nikon and Delkin are also manufacturing XQD cards. In late 2018, Lexar ‚Äì by then under new ownership ‚Äì announced that it would discontinue support for the XQD format in favour of CFexpress, citing problems with control, licensing and product availability. Hosts Sony has said their broadcast camcorders (XDCAM and XDCAM EX) will support the XQD cards. For their broadcast products the XQD card will be classified as a secondary media as XQD is based around consumer technology. Nonetheless, the cards will support acquisition in the broadcast quality MPEG HD422 50 Mbit/s format. On 4 September 2013, Sony released the PXW-Z100, a 4K prosumer camera that records onto XQD cards. Nikon supports XQD cards in its newer high-end DSLR and mirrorless cameras: Nikon D4, Nikon D4s, Nikon D5, Nikon D850, Nikon D500 and Nikon Z6 & Nikon Z7. Phase One XF IQ4 camera system (three bodies) supports XQD cards. Successor On 7 September 2016 the CFA announced the successor of XQD, CFexpress.

Diplomatic career An aristocrat of Granada origins, Zayas was a friend of the Manuel and Antonio Machado brothers and actor Ricardo Calvo and was active in the Modernism against academicism and nineteenth-century rhetoric. He protested with Valle-Incl√°n, Villaespesa and many others, over the Nobel awarded to Jose Echegaray and made friends with Juan Valera and Marcelino Men√©ndez y Pelayo, for whom he wrote a eulogy when he died in 1912. Around 1907, he translated Los Trofeos (the Trophies) (1893) by Jose Maria de Heredia, the most important book from this aesthetic. As a diplomat he lived for some time in Istanbul, a city to which he devoted the memoirs A orillas del B√≥sforo, Estocolmo, San Petersburgo, Bucarest, Berl√≠n y M√©xico (On the banks of the Bosphorus, Stockholm, St Petersburg, Bucharest, Berlin and Mexico). He received the Grand Cross of the Order of the Polar Star from the hands of the King of Sweden, and also the Grand Cross of the Order of the Crown , a proposal by the Minister of Romania. He was stationed in Buenos Aires in 1926, in February 1927 but had to cease duties suddenly for protesting along with the aviator Ramon Franco for the establishment of a regular airline between France and Argentina, which Spain had long delayed. This caused Franco to be arrested and Zayas was unposted. He spent the Civil War in the Royal Legation of Romania, where he was a diplomat. He died of arteriosclerosis in M√°laga in 1945. He was succeeded by his nephew, the fifth Duke of Amalfi. Literary career His first book, Poes√≠as (Poems) (1892), of nineteenth century rhetoric and outdated Romanticism, was succeeded by Joyeles bizantinos (Byzantine jewels) (1902)- although the book is less decadent than its title. Next came Retratos antiguos (Old Portraits), in the same year. Paisajes (Landscapes) was released in 1903. This was his clearest venture into symbolism in that the work did not tend to marmoreally paint the outside but the soul. Noches blancas (White Nights) and Leyenda (Legend) were released in 1905 and 1906. They emphasized a vein of exaltation of the historical past of Spain that would, from then on, be usual in his work. In these books he showed a remarkable command of language and his gift for versification. From 1907, in a very declared and sharp form, Antonio de Zayas abandoned any modernist fickleness and dedicated himself to defending what he would call the country tradition, with a rhetoric that got increasingly old. Antonio de Zayas hated foreignizing and decadent modernism for patriotic, moral and religious reasons. His last publications were Plus Ultra (Ultra Plus) (1924), Epinicios, segunda serie ((Triumphant hymns), second series) (1926) and Ante el altar y en la lid (Before the altar and in the fray) (1942).

He was the second son of Count Charles II of Alen√ßon (grandson of King Philip the Bold and younger brother of King Philip VI of France), who was killed in the Battle of Cr√©cy, and of Maria de La Cerda y de Lara (great-granddaughter of King Alfonso X of Castile). He was the younger brother of Count (later Archbishop) Charles III of Alen√ßon. Cardinal Philippe of Alen√ßon Born in the region of French Brie (), now the Department of Seine-et-Marne, Philippe entered Church service at an early age. He might have been the Archdeacon of Brie in his native Diocese of Meaux as a teenager. Philippe was named bishop of the Diocese of Beauvais, where he arrived on 24 March 1356 (aged 17) to take possession of the see, though he had not yet been consecrated, the details of which have been lost. After several years had passed without the confirmation of his appointment by the cathedral chapter, on 14 June 1360 he left to become the Archbishop of Rouen. Several years later, he entered into a dispute with King Charles V of France due to his refusal to grant a benefice to a priest whom the king had recommended. At that point Philippe moved to Rome, where Pope Gregory XI named him the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem. In 1374 he resigned the see of Rouen, and on 27 September of that same year was appointed as Apostolic Administrator of the Diocese of Auch, in which post he served until 1379. Pope Urban VI (elected 8 April 1378) promoted Philippe to the rank of Cardinal Priest in the consistory of 18 September 1378, with the Basilica of Santa Maria in Trastevere as his titular church. The pope also appointed him Vicar General of the Papal States. Two days later, Philippe joined his fellow French cardinals in rejecting the authority of Urban and elected as pope the Antipope Clement VII‚Äîwho allegedly had just authorized the massacre of 4,000 civilians in Cesena‚Äîwho soon established his seat at Avignon in France. This was the beginning of the Western Schism, which was to last until 1415. For this betrayal, Pope Urban stripped him of all his offices. Phillipe switched his allegiance in 1380 and was restored to his position, at which time he was promoted to the title of Cardinal Bishop of Sabina. The following year he was appointed the Patriarch of Aquileia, a prince-bishopric which was one of the most powerful ecclesiastical positions on the Italian peninsula. This appointment caused such serious discord among the local populace that, by 1388, the pope was forced to remove him. Serving as papal legate in Germany during 1389, he was unable to participate in the conclave that year which elected Urban's successor, Pope Boniface IX, who transferred him to the title of Cardinal Bishop of Ostia in 1392. Philippe became the Dean of the College of Cardinals in February 1394. He died in Rome in 1397 with a reputation for deep piety and was buried in the tomb he had built for himself in Santa Maria in Trastevere.

Early years Educated in a French seminary, Brady served on R√©union Island for twelve years. On his return to Rome in 1836 he met Dr William Ullathorne who was recruiting priests for the Australian mission and was eager to secure his services. Brady arrived in 1838 in Sydney with the first large group of secular Irish clergy to reach Australia. Bishop John Bede Polding appointed Brady to Windsor where his extensive parish included Penrith and all branches of the Hawkesbury from Windsor to Broken Bay. His charges were mainly Irish convicts assigned to the landholders, and he rode hundreds of miles a month to serve them. After repeated incidents of coercion he was instrumental in establishing the convicts' right to freedom of worship.C. Fowler, Anti- Catholic polemic at the origins of Australia's first Catholic newspaper, Journal of the Australian Catholic Historical Society 37 (2), 147‚Äì160. He was in touch with the Aboriginals and ministered to the French Canadian prisoners at Longbottom. Bishop of Perth After five years Brady was appointed vicar- general of Western Australia. Accompanied by a Dutch priest and an Irish catechist, he arrived in Perth on 13 December 1843 and was gratefully welcomed by the small group of Catholics who had been without a priest. Brady dealt reasonably competently with the colonial authoritiesO. O'Brien, The curious case of Bishop Brady: a new perspective, Journal of the Australian Catholic Historical Society 33 (2012), 10‚Äì22. and Governor John Hutt granted land for a church and school. Brady became convinced that he was working in a field ripe for the harvest and hastened to Rome to petition for priests and missionaries. He was particularly interested in evangelizing the Aboriginals and recommended that missions be established at King George Sound and Port Victoria. When it was decided to make Western Australia a separate diocese, Ullathorne declined the see and Brady was appointed bishop and consecrated in the Collegiate Church of Propaganda in May 1845. He returned to Perth next January with twenty-seven missionaries: French priests and brothers, Irish nuns and catechists and Spanish Benedictines. The small Catholic community could not absorb this group of differing nationalities and ecclesiastical training. Only one of the seven priests spoke English fluently. The French priests could do little with the Aboriginals near Albany, were suspected by the English settlers and finally transferred to Mauritius. Dom Joseph Serra and Dom Rosendo Salvado after initial difficulties established the flourishing Aboriginal mission at New Norcia. Brady was living in conditions of extreme privation as death or disaster scattered many of his helpers. Harassed by pastoral responsibilities he petitioned Propaganda for aid. Dom Serra, then in Europe raising funds for the debt-encumbered mission, was appointed coadjutor bishop of Perth and administrator of the temporalities of the see. This appointment did nothing to alleviate the mushrooming difficulties. Brady went to Rome in 1850 to lay his case before the congregation of Propaganda. He was admonished for administering church property unwisely; with Brady suspended of his functions in October 1851 by Pope Pius IX by a motu proprio and returned to Perth without permission and engaged in violent disputes with his coadjutor. The debacle was only terminated by legal action and the disciplinary visit of Archbishop Polding in 1852. Brady withdrew to his native diocese of Kilmore, Ireland, and died, not having resigned his see, on 2 December 1871 at Am√©lie-les-Bains. In March 2011, the body of Bishop John Brady was exhumed from the Cemetery of Amelie-les-Bains by Fr Robert Cross (archaeologist), Jade O' Brien (archaeologist), Odhran O'Brien (historian), Dr Michael Shanahan (medical expert) and Fr Jean-Noel Maree (translator). In August 2011, Archbishop Barry James Hickey solemnly reinterred the human remains of Bishop Brady in the crypt of the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary, Perth, Western Australia, in the Diocese which Bishop Brady was the founding Father. Published works Brady wrote a book detailing the language of the local aborigines: A Descriptive Vocabulary of the Native Language of W. Australia (1845 in English; an Italian version was published soon afterwards). A posthumous version titled A descriptive vocabulary of the West Australian Aboriginal language was published in 1899. The book appears to be an adaptation of A Descriptive Vocabulary of the Language in Common Use Amongst the Aborigines of Western Australia (1842) by George Fletcher Moore which Brady had presented in Rome. Exhumation In 2011, Brady's remains were exhumed from his grave in France and he was laid to rest in the crypt of St Mary's Cathedral, Perth.

Political Demography: How Population Changes are Reshaping National Politics and International Security. Oxford: Oxford University Press Population change is driven by classic demographic mechanisms ‚Äì birth, death, age structure, and migration. However, in political demography, there is always scope for assimilation as well as boundary and identity change, which can redraw the boundaries of populations in a way that is not possible with biological populations.Bookman, Milica Zarkovic. 1997. The demographic struggle for power : the political economy of demographic engineering in the modern world. London ; Portland, OR: Frank Cass Typically, political-demographic projections can account for both demographic factors and transitions caused by social change. A notable leader in the area of sub-state population projection is the World Population Program of the International Institute of Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) in Laxenburg, Austria. Some of the issues which are studied in the context of political demography are: surges of young people in the developing world, significantly increasing aging in the developed world, and the impact of increasing urbanization. Political demographers study issues like population growth in a political context. A population's growth is impacted by the relative balance of variables like mortality, fertility and immigration. Many of the present world's most powerful nations are aging quickly, largely as a result of major decreases in fertility rates and major increases in life expectancies. As the labor pools in these nations shrink, and spending on the elderly increases, their economies are likely to slow down. By 2050, the workforce in Japan and Russia is predicted to decrease by more than 30 percent, while the German workforce is expected to decline by 25 percent by that year. The governments of these countries have made financial commitments to the elderly in their populations which will consume huge percentages of their national GDP. For example, based on current numbers, more than 25% of the national GDPs of Japan, France and Germany will be consumed by these commitments by 2040. Political demography and evolution Differential reproductive success is the mechanism through which evolution takes place. For much of human history this occurred through migrations and wars of conquest, with disease and mortality through famine and war affecting the power of empires, tribes and city-states. Differential fertility also played a part, though typically reflected resource availability rather than cultural factors.Diamond, Jared. (1997). Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies. New York: W.W. Norton; McNeill, William Hardy. 1976. Plagues and peoples. 1st ed. Garden City, N.Y.: Anchor Press. Though culture has largely usurped this role, some claim that differential demography continues to affect cultural and political evolution.Blume, Michael. 2009. \\"'The Reproductive Benefits of Religious Affiliation'.\\" In The Biological Evolution of Religious Mind and Behavior, ed. E. Voland and W. Schiefenh√∂vel. New York: Springer- Verlag, pp. 117-26 (Blume 2009) Uneven transition, democratization and globalization The demographic transition from the late eighteenth century onwards opened up the possibility that significant change could occur within and between political units. Though the writings of Polybius and Cicero in classical times bemoaned the low fertility of the patrician elite as against their more fecund barbarian competitors,Jackson, Richard, and Neil Howe. 2011. \\"'Global Aging And Global Security In The 21st Century'.\\" in Political Demography: How Population Changes are Reshaping National Politics and International Security, ed. J. A. Goldstone, Eric Kaufmann and Monica Duffy Toft. Oxford: Oxford University Press differential fertility has probably only recently emerged as a central aspect of political demography. This has come about due to medical advances which have lowered infant mortality while conquest migrations have faded as a factor in world history. Differences in immunity levels to infectious diseases between populations also play no major role in our age of modern medicine and widespread exposure to a common disease pool. It is not so much the trajectory of demographic transition that counts as the fact that it has become more intense and uneven in the late twentieth century as it has spread into the developing world. Uneven transitions lend themselves to differential growth rates between contending groups. These changes are in turn, magnified by democratization, which entrenches majority rule and privileges the power of numbers in politics as never before. Indeed, in many new democracies riven by ethnic and religious conflicts, elections are akin to censuses while groups seek to 'win the census'. Ethnic parties struggle to increase their constituencies through pronatalism ('wombfare'), oppose family planning, and contest census and election results.Toft, Monica Duffy. 2011. \\"Wombfare: The Religious and Political Dimensions of Fertility and Demographic Change.\\" in Political Demography: How Population Changes are Reshaping National Politics and International Security, ed.

Berkeley: University of California Press, esp. chapters 3-4,7 and 8 Ethnic, national and civilizational conflict One branch of political demography examines how differences in population growth between nation-states, religions, ethnic groups and civilizations affects the balance of power between these political actors. For instance, Ethiopia was projected to have a larger population than Russia in 2020, and while there were 3.5 Europeans per African in 1900, there will be four Africans for each European in 2050.Demeny, P, and G. McNicoll, eds. 2006. The Political Economy of Global Population Change, 1950-2050.

Oxford: Oxford University Press Irish Catholics in Northern Ireland increased their share of the population through higher birthrates and the momentum of a youthful age structure from 35 to nearly 50 percent of the total between 1965 and 2011. Similar changes, also affected by in- and out- migration, have taken place in, amongst others, the United States (Hispanics), Israel-Palestine (Jews and Arabs), Kosovo (Albanians), Lebanon (Shia, with decline of Christians) and Nagorno-Karabakh (Armenians). In the US, the growth of Hispanics and Asians, and Hispanics' youthful age profile as against whites, has the potential to tilt more states away from the Republican Party.Frey, William H. 2011. \\"Racial Demographics and the 2008 Presidential Election in the United States \\" in Political Demography: How Population Changes are Reshaping National Politics and International Security, ed.

Oxford: Oxford University Press On the other hand, the fertility advantage of conservative over liberal white voters is significant and rising, thus the Republicans are poised to win a larger share of the white vote - especially over the very long run of 50 to 100 years.Lesthaeghe, R., and L.

Kaufmann, armed with empirical from a number of countries, also posits that this will be further bolstered by the higher retention rates of religious fundamentalists, with individuals in religiously fundamentalist households less likely to become religiously non- observant than others.Kaufmann, Eric. 2011. Shall the Religious Inherit the Earth: Demography and Politics in the Twenty-First Century. London: Profile Books. Also see www.sneps.net. See also . Age structure and politics Youth bulges A second avenue of inquiry considers age structures: be these 'youth bulges' or aging populations. Young populations are associated with a ratio of dependents to producers: a high proportion of the population under age 16 puts pressure on resources. A 'youth bulge' of those in the 16-30 bracket creates a different set of problems. A large population of adolescents entering the labor force and electorate strains at the seams of the economy and polity, which were designed for smaller populations. This creates unemployment and alienation unless new opportunities are created quickly enough - in which case a 'demographic dividend' accrues because productive workers outweigh young and elderly dependents. Yet the 16-30 age range is associated with risk-taking, especially among males. In general, youth bulges in developing countries are associated with higher unemployment and, as a result, a heightened risk of violence and political instability.; For some, the transition to more mature age structures is almost a sine qua non for democratization.Cincotta, Richard, and John Doces. 2011. \\"The Age-structural Maturity Thesis: The Youth Bulge's Influence on the Advent and Stability of Liberal Democracy?\\" In Political Demography: How Population Changes are Reshaping National Politics and International Security, ed. J. A. Goldstone, Eric Kaufmann and Monica Duffy Toft. Oxford: Oxford University Press Population aging Population aging presents the obverse effect: older populations are less risk-taking and less prone to violence and instability. However, like those under-16, they place great strain on the social safety net, especially in countries committed to old-age provision and high-quality medical care. Some observers believe that the advent of a much older planet, courtesy of below-replacement fertility in Europe, North America, China and much of the rest of Asia and Latin America, will produce a 'geriatric peace'.Haas, M. L. 2007. \\"A geriatric peace? The future of US power in a world of aging populations.\\" International Security 32 (1):112-32; Haas, Mark. 2011. \\"'America‚Äôs Golden Years?:U.S. Security in an Aging World'.\\" in Political Demography: How Population Changes are Reshaping National Politics and International Security, ed. J. A. Goldstone, Eric Kaufmann and Monica Duffy Toft. Oxford: Oxford University Press Others are concerned that population aging will bankrupt the welfare state and handicap western liberal democracies' ability to project power abroad to defend their interests. A more cautious climate could also herald slower economic growth, less entrepreneurship and reduced productivity in mature democracies. It is also possible that ageing leads to lower inflation as elderly people are both inflation averse and politically powerful. However, some argue that older people in the developed world have much higher productivity, human capital and better health than their counterparts in developing countries, so the economic effects of population aging will be largely mitigated.

Since 2000 the subject has drawn the attention of policymakers and journalists and is now emerging as an academic subfield. Panels on political demography appear at demography conferences such as the Population Association of America (PAA) and European Association for Population Studies (EAPS). There is now a political demography section at the International Studies Association. A number of important international conferences have also taken place since 2006 on the subject.

He was born in Vitoria on July 19, 1800 and died in Santiago, Chile. He served as Spanish governor of Chile, on an interim basis, from 24 May to 18 September 1796. As judge and mayor over crime in Lima in 1781, he led the case against T√∫pac Amaru II, writing the judgment which condemned to death by hanging him and several of his followers, as well as penalties in prisons in Africa, Callao and Valdivia for many others. Education and career He studied law at the University of Granada and the University of Valladolid. He was rector of the Colegio Mayor del Arzobispo of Salamanca in 1766, 1768 and 1770. He taught Instituta at the University of Salamanca. Chile Already a doctor of law, between 1778 and 1780 he served as judge of the Real Audiencia of Chile. He was very active in this colony. He worked as an inspector of the works of the Santiago de Chile Cathedral, as Senior Judge over deceased property, as the protector of Convictorio Carolino and the Provincial Women's Hospital. He was known to own a small print shop for his private use, apparently the first or second operated in this country. Peru In 1781 de Rezabal y Ugarte was transferred to Lima to work as Mayor of crime. In this new destination he led the case against T√∫pac Amaru II, for the uprising that he had spearheaded. The decision in this case was published in 1783 by colonial order. de Rezabal y Ugarte also led other causes connected with this case, including another trial against Manuel Antonio Figueroa, called El Incognito. While in Peru, de Rezabal y Ugarte occupied all kinds of positions, such as Director Royal of Studies at the University of San Marcos, Proprietary Judge and Dean Judge of the new Real Audiencia of Cuzco in 1786. This last position was not occupied at first as it was intended for the complicated trial prompted by the collapse which occurred at the mine in Huancavelica that year, killing 200 people. In that case the proceedings focused on embezzlement charges against the director of the institution, Francisco Marroquin. He married in 1787 to Jane Catherine Micheo y Jim√©nez de Lobaton. After taking on such notorious causes he aspired to fill a vacancy for judge of the Real Audiencia of Lima without much success, so he decided to hold the office of judge that was awaiting him in Cuzco in 1791. Work as governor During his brief four-month governing he continued the work of Tajamares del Mapocho, originally initiated by the outgoing governor Ambrosio O'Higgins. According to Diego Barros Arana it was de Rezabal y Ugarte who planted the poplar grove that ran along these river defenses, which was the only public promenade in the city of Santiago for over 30 years.
