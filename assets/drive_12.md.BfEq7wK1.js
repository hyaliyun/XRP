In visual terms, this can include signage, uniforms, liveries, interior design and branded merchandise. Brand implementation encompasses facets of architecture, product design, industrial design, quantity surveying, engineering, procurement, project management and retail design. Brand implementation is an integrated part of a branding cycle and needs to be initiated during the brand design and development phase. Brand implementation is the continuous and consistent application of the brand's image in all business units, communication channels and media. This refers to marketing and branding as a unified whole. In that respect, brand implementation is a continuous process, which requires controlling the brand's image and presence despite changes in markets and company structure.Misof, Guenther (2007). ‚ÄûBrand Implementation. Managing and Controlling Brand Identity‚Äú, Germany Background Brand implementation emerged as a discipline in the 1990s when brand owners recognized the need for consistency across branded estates. Traditionally, brand implementation was handled by various parties, including shop-fitters, interior designers and sign companies. Lack of centralized project management led to inconsistencies, while information dissymmetry meant suppliers had too much control over brand issues. Brand implementation was consequently coined as an umbrella term for all aspects of the application and maintenance of physical brand assets. Key problem fields The experience of more than 80 companies operating worldwide shows that a lack of planning before the rebrand,Brand Implementation: TBC, Tony Lorenz, 2012 consistent implementation and complete control are the key problems of brand implementation. Eight large stumbling blocks stand in the way of effective implementation: * Inadequate communicationA roadmap for communication during brand change, Patrick Heath, 2019 https://brandactive.com/agency-stakeholder- rebrand-communication/ * No situation and needs analysis * Lack of consequence * Undefined processes * Fragmented (organizational) structures.Study in more than 80 companies operating worldwide.

The company produced the first H0e (HO (1:87) scale narrow gauge rolling stock using N gauge track) models, and established HOe as a viable model railway standard. The firm was founded in 1963 by three brothers. One of them, a performer, soon left the firm. Theodor Egger, technician, and Jonathan Egger, salesman, continued.Egger-bahn: History The models first appeared at the 1963 Nurenberg Toy Fair. The scale/gauge combination represented 600‚Äì750 mm gauge lines, but could reasonably depict several similar narrow gauge sizes. 009 is a similar concept, used mainly for modelling UK-based prototypes, again on N gauge track, but to the OO scale of 4 mm to 1 ft (1:76.2). Egger was the first to produce H0e ready-to-run models, and they were a great success. In 1964 the range was expanded, including a steam locomotive. Models from Egger-Bahn were often used in presentation lay-outs. For instance Faller used them in their magazine, because Faller produced models more in a scale of 1:100 than 1:87. The small Egger_bahn models suited it very well. In the USA Egger-Bahn was marketed by AHM (as H0n30 scale) together with Roco Peetzy models under the name of \\"Minitrains\\". In order to cope with the market demands Egger had to produce more models. Besides, technical improvements, as Magna-Kraft, meant that models and moulds had to be reworked very often. Furthermore it was decided to simplify the models in order to cope with the demands. Customers respond badly to this change and sales went down. The company had to find new financial resources. These were found with Tristan movie company (Constantin movie company) that produced the Old Shatterhand movies. Tristan was forced to produce more USA-style models suiting the Winnetou scene. This was not successful. In the end the firm was broken up in 1967 and Jouef later acquired the toolings and produced the models. Jouef ended production in the early seventies. In 1983 the old moulds were discovered in an old bunker. Jouef tried to re-market these models under the name of Egger-Bahn in grey boxes. As sales were mostly directed inside France, the market was not large enough and production finished in the early nineties. The company name registration was not renewed and now is possessed by private owners including and Theodor Egger. Apart from the narrow-gauge trains, Egger-Bahn produced a boat in N-scale. It was meant to become a mechanical moving boat in real water. This was the great love of Mr Theodor. He only produced one Mississippi-styled boat. Egger also started the production of slotcars with the name of Egger-Silberpfeil. These models can also be found with Jouef. The Egger-models ran with a Jouef motor. The Egger- Lectron,Egger-Lectron Era a system for modular electronic experimentation, consisting of elements with magnetic links, has been a quite successful product. It was licensed by Braun and Raytheon, and later spun off in an independent company Lectron GmbH. The Lectron system is still in production today.

It was last active at Reese Air Force Base, Texas, where it conducted pilot training for twenty-five years before it was inactivated in September 1997. The wing was first activated in as the 64th Troop Carrier Wing in 1952 at Donaldson Air Force Base, South Carolina, but was inactivated within two years. It was again active twice as an airlift unit in the 1960s. In 1972, Air Training Command replaced its four digit Major Command controlled flying training units with units whose heritage could be continued and the wing was activated at Reese, where it conducted pilot training until it was inactivated. History =Airlift= The 64th performed airlift and airdrop/airlanding of troops and cargo, routinely and during frequent maneuvers, 1952‚Äì1953. It began phasing down for inactivation in mid-October 1953, at which time tactical operations passed to 63d Troop Carrier Wing. In February 1954, however, the wing began building up again in preparation for an overseas movement, but was inactivated instead. The 64th was activated at Dyess Air Force Base, Texas in February 1961 with a troop carrier/airlift mission, plus resupply of Distant Early Warning Line sites on the Greenland ice cap. The wing was again inactivated on 1 January 1963. It was reactivated and replaced Troop Carrier Wing Provisional, 4413th, in July 1966 at Sewart Air Force Base, Tennessee. The wing provided global airlift and aeromedical evacuation, July 1966 ‚Äì May 1971. It also provided Lockheed C-130 Hercules combat crew training for other units from, 1 July 1966 ‚Äì 6 March 1970, with this being the wing's primary activity from 9 August 1968 to 6 March 1970. It was replaced at Little Rock Air Force Base, Arkansas, in May 1971 by 314th Tactical Airlift Wing. =Flying training= The 64th was renamed the 64th Flying Training Wing and replaced the 3500th Pilot Training Wing in October 1972, assuming the mission of undergraduate pilot training and operation and maintenance of Reese Air Force Base, Texas. It also supported Strategic Air Command's Accelerated Co-Pilot Enrichment Program through operating locations at Minot Air Force Base, North Dakota ; Ellsworth Air Force Base, South Dakota; and Grand Forks Air Force Base, North Dakota from 1976 until 1991. The 64th began specialized undergraduate pilot training in July 1992, using T‚Äì1A Jayhawk to prepare students for airlift tanker/transport training and the Northrop T-38 Talon aircraft for students in fighter/bomber track. Air Education and Training Command inactivated the wing on 30 September 1997 with the closure of Reese Air Force Base pursuant to Base Realignment and Closure Commission action.

Naming  Especially in the early 19th century, this genus was often confused with the Carditid genus Cardites. Cardita was originally established by J.G. Brugui√®re in 1792. However, in 1801 Jean-Baptiste Lamarck described it under the name Cardites. J.H.F. Link subsequently described a new genus using the name Cardites in 1807. When this homonymy was realised, Megerle in 1811 re- described Link's genus Cardites as Cardita. Megerle's action resulted in four technically valid names which formed two mutual pairs of homonyms. The matter was ultimately resolved by starting with the oldest name - that of Brugui√®re - and applying it as intended, and suppressing Lamarck's name so that Link's junior homonym could be used for Cardites. In addition to the numerous junior synonyms, Byssomera - a junior synonym or subgenus of Carditamera - has sometimes been written as a subgenus of Cardita, due to its type species having been synonymised from Cardita (Byssomera) affinis to Carditamera (Byssomera) affinis.

These were first considered to be a third generation of paramilitary groups but there are Colombian military reports suggesting the √Åguilas Negras are intermediaries in the drug business between the guerrilla and drug cartels outside Colombia. As of 2007 they were reported as active in the city of Barrancabermeja. Origins The Black Eagles first appeared in the Norte de Santander Department in 2006. On 18 October 2006, President √Ålvaro Uribe openly ordered their detention. The government ordered the creation of a new Search Bloc against the Black Eagles and classified this organization as a gang of former paramilitaries.Nine presumed members of the √Åguilas Negras captured, ejercito.mil.co; accessed 20 August 2007. Las √Åguilas Negras are one of a number of groups that have formed following the demilitarisation of the AUC, and they are said to be closely linked with the Usuga Clan. Drugs The Black Eagles are closely associated with drug cartels and are involved in drug trafficking activities, extortions, racketeering and kidnappings. They have also attacked guerrilla members and suspected sympathizers. One individual who has been accused of leading the Black Eagles is former AUC leader Vicente Casta√±o. Casta√±o later disappeared and was believed to have been assassinated under the orders of Diego Murillo Bejarano in retaliation for taking controls of territory and criminal rackets.

Both WLRX and WAWX are owned and operated by Educational Media Foundation. Combined 106.1/101.7 history 106.1 FM started out with the call sign WWFO on January 18, 1991 and officially launched in 1994. 101.7 FM started out with the call sign WDMS-FM on August 1, 1964 before being changed to WJJS in 1969 with a Black music format. In 1986 the calls and format moved to its sister station at 1320 AM, while the FM became Top-40 as \\"U102\\" WXYU. On January 1, 1992, the Urban format and WJJS calls returned to 101.7, while WXYU, by then a Country station, moved to AM. In 1994, the frequencies began a simulcast as \\"Jammin' 101.7 and 106.1\\" and 106.1 FM as a rhythmic top 40 format. 101.7 FM moved its callsign, WJJS to 106.1 FM on May 18, 1994, while 101.7 FM became WJJX on April 29, 1994. On August 29, 1996, 106.1 FM modified the callsign to WJJS-FM and the WJJS call sign was returned to 1320 AM (now WVGM).

But by 2005, WJJS-FM/WJJX would start shifting back towards a pure rhythmic direction as they began phasing out non-rhythmic product, resulting in a complete return to rhythmic top 40 in the Spring of 2006. At noon on December 17, 2007, the WZBL call sign and classic country format was moved from 104.9 FM to 106.1 FM as \\"106.1 The Bull\\". This was part of a frequency swap that moved the WJJS call letters to 104.9 FM as \\"Jammin' JJS\\". On the same date, the 101.7 FM \\"WJJX\\" simulcast was also swapped with WSNV, which had been broadcasting on 102.7 FM, simulcasting WSNV at 93.5 FM. At noon on March 27, 2009, the format was changed to adult hits as \\"106.1 Steve FM; Playing Whatever We Want\\". The new callsign, WSFF, went into effect a day later on March 28. By late 2012, the slogan changed to \\"Random Radio\\". At 5:00 P.M. on March 25, 2011, WSFF began simulcasting on WSNZ at 101.7 FM, once again reuniting 106.1 FM with 101.7 FM.

The locality where his specimen was captured is not known, but is thought to be near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. C. bartonii lives in fast‚Äìflowing, cool, rocky streams as well as shallow lakes, and is found in the Canadian provinces of Ontario, Quebec and New Brunswick, and in the United States from Maine to Alabama. In the south of its range, C. bartoni is restricted to the Appalachian Mountains and their foothills. Colouration is usually plain dark brown, although mottling is occasionally seen, as is a saddle-shaped marking. Several subspecies of C. bartonii have been recognised, but it is unclear how advisable this is, and work is ongoing to determine patterns of infraspecific variation.

Geography and geology Gunna lies between Coll and Tiree, closer to Coll. It is in area and at its highest point. Nowhere is it wider than . It has no permanent inhabitants; the only house is used as a holiday residence by its owner, Marcus de Ferranti. It is surrounded by various smaller islands including Eilean Frachlan (just off the north coast), Eilean nan Gamhna off the south coast, Soy Gunna to the north east, and Eilean Bhoramull, which is nearer Coll. It is surrounded by many rocks, especially in Gunna Sound (Scottish Gaelic: Am Bun Dubh), between it and Tiree. According to Haswell- Smith, the island has a: \\"bedrock of paragneiss schist with a light sandy soil. Metasediments in the west grade into undifferentiated gneiss in the east\\". Etymology and history \\"Gunni\\" is a Norse forename, and Haswell- Smith suggests that Gunni-√∏y means \\"island of Gunni the Dane\\" (although it is not recorded for which Gunni the island was named) or conceivably that the modern name is from Eilean nan Gamhna, Gaelic for \\"island of the stirks\\". Mac an T√†illeir suggests that the Norse means \\"Gunnar's island\\". It was possibly an anchorite/culdee's island at some point - beside the old well, there is Port na Cille, which means Port of the Monk's Cell. Uamh M√≤r, (big cave) on the north coast, could well be where the hermit sheltered. According to Mac an T√†illeir Gunna is mentioned in the lines of a song, \\"Farewell beyond Gunna to Mull of the great mountains\\". Wildlife Gunna supports a wide range of sea birds, as well as geese, and shelducks. Grey seals also breed here. It is currently used for grazing from Coll.

Kaykhusraw's elder sons, by different mothers, were Kaykaus II and Kilij Arslan IV, and also served as sultan after their father's death, often simultaneously.

In 1254 the Mongols asked that Kaykaus II, then nineteen years old, come in person to M√∂ngke, the Great Khan. The brothers, at a conference in Kayseri, decided that Kayqubad II should go to in his stead. The voyage to M√∂ngke‚Äôs capital at Karakhorum would be arduous.

One day on the road Kayqubad was found dead. The vizier Baba Tughra‚Äôi, who had joined the embassy en route, was accused but nothing came of it. Kayqubad was buried somewhere in the wastes between Anatolia and Mongolia.

The Work Center was founded in 1968 by a group of American artists and writers to support promising individuals in the early stages of their creative careers. The Work Center, whose founders included Stanley Kunitz, Robert Motherwell, Myron Stout and Jack Tworkov, annually offers ten writers and ten visual artists seven-month residencies, including a work area and a monthly stipend. The Center also offers a Master of Fine Arts degree in collaboration with the Massachusetts College of Art and Design, seasonal programs, and readings and other events. The Center was awarded a 2010 National Endowment for the Arts Access to Artistic Excellence grant to support the Winter Fellowship program. The Center‚Äôs website summarizes the importance of the Center in this way: Notable former fellows include writers Michael Cunningham, Alice Fulton, Louise Gl√ºck, Denis Johnson, Yusef Komunyakaa, Jhumpa Lahiri, Susan Mitchell and Franz Wright; and visual artists Yun-Fei Ji, Sam Messer and Lisa Yuskavage.  History  The Fine Arts Work Center was founded in 1968 by a now illustrious group of artists, writers and patrons, including Fritz Bultman, Salvatore and Josephine Del Deo, Alan Dugan, Stanley Kunitz, Philip Malicoat, Robert Motherwell, Myron Stout, Jack Tworkov, and Hudson D. Walker. The founders envisioned a place in Provincetown, the country's most enduring arts colony, where artists and writers could live and work together in the early phase of their careers. The founders believed that the freedom to pursue creative work within a community of peers is the best catalyst for artistic growth. The Work Center has dedicated itself to this mission for over forty years. The Fellowship Program Today the Fine Arts Work Center is a leading long-term residency program for emerging artists and writers and one of the most renowned. Each year the Visual Arts and Writing Committees, composed of internationally recognized artists and writers, select twenty Fellows (ten visual artists and ten writers) from some 1,000 applications worldwide. The selection process is rigorous, and the Fellows are accepted on the basis of the quality of work submitted. For the seven-month period of October 1 to May 1, the selected painters, sculptors, installation, and time-based media artists, photographers, fiction writers and poets bring their lives to Provincetown to devote their time to their work. The Fellows receive living and studio space and a modest stipend; the only thing asked in return is that they stay in Provincetown and focus on their work. Each year, writing Fellows have the opportunity to publicly read from their work and visual artists are invited to exhibit in solo shows. All Fellows can publish their work online in the in-house art and literary journal Shankpainter. Since the Work Center's founding, more than 800 Fellowships have been awarded. Fellows have made an enormous impact on American arts and letters, publishing hundreds of books and exhibiting their art in countless museums and galleries worldwide. Past Fellows have won virtually every major national award in their respective fields, including the Pulitzer, MacArthur, Whiting, Pollock- Krasner, Tiffany, Prix de Rome, Guggenheim, NEA, and National Book Award. The Fine Arts Work Center awards more fellowships each year than any other program of its kind. It is among the most competitive fellowship programs anywhere. Its presence in Provincetown, with its rich artistic heritage, stunning natural beauty and legendary light, enhances its renown. The Summer Workshop Program Each summer, the Fine Arts Work Center offers approximately eighty workshops focused on creative writing and the visual arts. Hundreds of students study with a faculty of master artists and writers; the workshops are week-long, extending over ten weeks from mid-June through late August. The Summer Workshop Program has been accredited by American University, Lesley University and Maine College of Art in Portland. Revenues from this program help support the Fellowships. Other residency programs The Fine Arts Work Center offers a Returning Residency Program that encourages former Fellows to return to Provincetown by offering apartments and studios at discount rates during a number of weeks in the Spring and Fall. The Long-Term Residency Program for former Fellows was recently inaugurated, and extends the opportunity to live in Provincetown for up to three years at below-market rents. Five new live/work spaces at the Meadow Road development on Bradford Street are offered to former Fellows (for up to three years) who meet the affordable rental guidelines; each unit is approximately with separate studio space. In collaboration with other arts organizations around the country and abroad, the Fine Arts Work Center hosts one- to three-month Collaborative Residencies in the Summer and Fall. Writers or visual artists are selected on the merit of their work by the collaborating organization. Apartments, studio space and stipends are sponsored by the collaborating organizations; the Work Center provides the space in which to work and, perhaps most importantly, a community of like-minded peers with whom to share and discuss ideas, the very essence of collaboration. The Ohio Arts Council, a collaborative residency partner since 1994, sends a writer and a visual artist for three months every summer. The Maryland Institute College of Art sends one visual artist each year for a two-month period. For the past several years Four Way Books has sponsored one month-long residency for poets published by the press. The Copley Society of Boston, also a long-time collaborative partner, awards a one-month residency to a visual artist. The Gaea Foundation also works in collaboration with the Work Center, though its residents live off-site in a cottage on Commercial Street. Artists, writers, musicians and performers, usually with a political or activist bent, are given one- to two-month residencies and a stipend to live and work in Provincetown. The MFA in Visual Arts Since September 2005 the Massachusetts College of Art and Design has collaborated with the Fine Arts Work Center to offer a low-residency Master of Fine Arts program in Provincetown. Candidates selected by the Boston-based MassArt study and work in Provincetown at the Center during four 24-day residencies in September and May over the course of the two-year program. They are taught and evaluated by a faculty of prominent resident and visiting artists. During the periods between the Provincetown residencies, the students, many of whom are already pursuing careers in the arts, return home to work under the guidance of approved mentors who visit their studios once a month. On-line history and academic courses support an understanding of the historical and cultural context of contemporary work, including their own. At the conclusion of the program, candidates return to the Work Center for a final two-week residency in September to present their thesis shows, participate in thesis reviews and submit their written theses. The Visiting Artists and Writers Series Since 1968 the Fine Arts Work Center has brought nationally recognized artists and writers to Provincetown for public lectures, readings and exhibitions. Each year thousands of people enjoy these presentations, which are free and open to the public. These events occur throughout the year. Recent visiting artists and writers include Galway Kinnell, Marge Piercy, Mark Doty, Paula Vogel, Robert Pinsky, Oscar Hijuelos, Jonathan Franzen, Richard Prince, Ha Jin, Marilynne Robinson, Denis Johnson, Mark Strand, and Bill Jensen. Readings and talks are scheduled year-round.

Wartime service and aftermath  After graduating from Florida, where he was also a member of ROTC, he became a commissioned officer in the United States Army. During World War II, he was promoted to the rank of Lt. Colonel, being stationed for a time in Bournemouth, England before being discharged on February 28, 1946. Upon returning to Tampa, he eventually became the president of the Tampa Bay Milk Producers.  Political career  In 1959, Lane campaigned against three other candidates for mayor and defeated Nick Nuccio in a run-off election. During his term, Lane faced a depleted treasury and a city budget of thirty million dollars. The municipal hospitals were unable to pay their bills and storm sewers were desperately needed after the havoc created by Hurricane Donna. Mayor Lane enforced stricter adherence to Civil Service hiring guidelines. He closed the Clara Frye Hospital for blacks and merged its services with the Tampa Municipal Hospital. Mayor Lane helped establish the Tampa Hospital Board and removed the hospitals from the city's direct administration. During his term of office, Julian Lane and the City Council expanded the construction of storm and sanitary sewers and the pavement of over two hundred miles of streets. Construction of a new public library building was approved and Redland Baseball Field was completed replacing Plant Field. Improvements were made along the public beach on Davis Causeway and 12.7 acres of riverfront land was purchased along the Hillsborough River. The city also began the Maryland Avenue Urban Renewal Project and built Community Centers in Interbay, West Tampa, and Forrest Hills. Mayor Lane also appointed a committee to study the proposed construction of Tampa Stadium. The Fire Department's manpower was increased by the addition of two hundred new firemen. There were also ninety-nine new fire hydrants installed in the City. In 1961, Lane supervised the transition when the City of Port Tampa and surrounding industrial areas were annexed into the City of Tampa. At the end of Mayor Lane's term, in September 1963, the first black children were enrolled in traditionally white schools at Jackson Heights and Westshore Elementary Schools. He worked closely with the Bi-Racial Committee to facilitate peaceful integration of downtown businesses. The Tampa Tribune also worked with the mayor to help ensure that integration in Tampa was as orderly as possible. Lane was defeated for re-election in 1963 by former mayor Nuccio, whom Lane had defeated in 1959. Lane served terms as a state representative, from 1970 to 1972, and as a state senator, from 1972 to 1976.  Retirement and legacy  Julian and his wife Frances Elizabeth LaMotte (1917-1998), had 4 children - Susan LaMotte Lane, Julian B. Lane Jr., Virginia Lane, and William Lane (d. 2012), and seven grandchildren. He was a member of the First Presbyterian Church of Tampa. Lane returned to Tampa to retire after his state political career. He died there in 1997; he was 82 years old. He is buried at Myrtle Hill Cemetery in Tampa. The Julian B. Lane Riverfront Park in Tampa is named for him. It underwent an extensive renovation during Mayor Bob Buckhorn's tenure and re-opened in 2018.

History and Operations Cole originally named the company Kenneth Cole Incorporated in September 1982 and planned to showcase his new line of shoes during market week at the Hilton New York Hotel. Finding that he could not afford to purchase a hotel room or showroom to exhibit his line, he borrowed a truck and asked the mayor‚Äôs office for permission to park two blocks away from the Hilton Hotel in front of a fancy shoe building. Upon learning that permits were only granted to utility companies and production companies shooting full- length motion pictures, Cole changed the name of the company to Kenneth Cole Productions, Inc. and applied for a permit to shoot a full-length motion picture entitled ‚ÄúThe Birth of a Shoe Company‚Äù. With Kenneth Cole Productions painted on the side of the truck, they opened for business on December 2, 1982, in front of 1370 Avenue of the Americas. They had a fully furnished forty-foot trailer, klieg lights, a director, a rolling camera, models as actresses, and two NYPD policemen as doormen. A velvet rope allowed a limited number of people into the trailers and in two and a half days they sold forty thousand pairs of shoes. The company remains Kenneth Cole Productions, Inc. to this day to honor this unusual beginning.Cole, Kenneth. \\"The Birth of a Shoe Company.\\" Kennethcole.com (accessed November 18, 2008). In 1984, Kenneth Cole opened his first store on Columbus Avenue in Manhattan, followed shortly thereafter by another store on Union Street in San Francisco. Kenneth Cole retail and Company Stores can now be found worldwide in countries such as Mexico, Canada, Venezuela, Colombia, Israel, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, Hong Kong, Philippines, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Singapore, Australia South Africa and India. In 2013, Elana Drell Szyfer was named executive vice president of global brand strategy for Kenneth Cole Productions and, before this, she was CEO of Ahava Corp. Kenneth Cole Productions announced in November 2016 that it would be closing all of its outlet stores within six months to focus on e-commerce and other lines of revenue outside of operating physical stores.

Campaigns often incorporate topical issues, such as addressing Imelda Marcos's shoe fetish in 1986 with the line, ‚ÄúImelda Marcos bought 2,700 pairs of shoes. She could've at least had the courtesy to buy a pair of ours.‚Äù In 1994, the company ran its first partisan political ad for the New York state gubernatorial race featuring George Pataki and Mario Cuomo, Cole's father-in-law. The ad was an image of a muddy boot with the words: ‚ÄúNext time you hear George Pataki speak, might we suggest the appropriate footwear.‚Äù George Pataki did end up becoming governor and Cole received some backlash for his decision to run the ad. Not all of their ads are as overtly political, but most have a humorous tint to them, often incorporating word plays or puns. Some of his better-known lines include: ‚ÄúWhat you stand for is more important than what you stand in,‚Äù ‚ÄúAre you putting us on?‚Äù and ‚ÄúToday is not a dress rehearsal.‚Äù Popular topics in his advertising include HIV/AIDS, homelessness, gun control, abortion, the environment and same-sex marriage. The current advertising campaign uses the tagline ‚ÄúWe need more than a surface mentality. The writing is on the wall.‚Äù Charity and social causes Kenneth Cole Productions, Inc. is active in charities and often uses advertising, publicity and other corporate initiatives to support charitable causes. Cole‚Äôs advocacy for AIDS awareness and research has made the fashion house a legend in philanthropic circles. He is a longtime board member and current Chairman of the Board for The Foundation for AIDS Research (amfAR). His involvement with amfAR began in 1985 when he organized a public service campaign that was photographed by Annie Leibovitz and featuring high-profile models such as Christie Brinkley, Paulina Porizkova and Andie MacDowell. The tagline was, ‚ÄúFor the future of our children. Support the American Foundation for AIDS Research. We do.‚Äù At the time, AIDS was still a relatively unknown and misunderstood disease. Cole managed to procure nearly 3 million dollars worth of donated exposure and press. In 1987, he was invited to join amfAR‚Äôs board. In 2005, Cole spearheaded the ‚ÄúWe All Have AIDS‚Äù awareness campaign with advertisements photographed by Mark Seliger and featuring such luminaries as Nelson Mandela, Tom Hanks, Will Smith, Elton John, Sharon Stone, Richard Gere, Elizabeth Taylor, Alicia Keys, Desmond Tutu, Natasha Richardson, Eric McCormack, Ashley Judd, Whoopi Goldberg, Harry Belafonte, Greg Louganis and Rosie O'Donnell. He also has annual World AIDS Day promotions in his retail stores. In August 2006, it was announced that Kenneth Cole Productions would stop selling fur in all of their garments for the Fall 2007 Fashion Season.(2006)\\"Kenneth Cole Gives the Boot to Cruelty, Pledges to Go Fur-Free\\" August 18, 2006.

Recently, he partnered with rock star Jon Bon Jovi to create a line of jackets, T-shirts and fragrance under the Kenneth Cole New York label. The proceeds from the sale of these items supported HELP USA. Other charity campaigns include establishing relief funds for victims of 9/11 and Hurricane Katrina respectively through the sale of T-shirts, giving discounts at his retail stores for donating shoes or clothes to the homeless and hosting numerous charity shopping nights at retail stores throughout the nation.Kenneth Cole Charity. \\"Kenneth Cole Awearness.\\" Kennethcole.com (accessed August 20, 2007). Financial performance Since 2008, Kenneth Cole Productions has been on a sustained revenue slide, which has led analysts from a variety of brokerage houses to cut their ratings on the stock. Kenneth Cole Productions returned to profitability in Q309; however, estimates for the coming year remain weak. In January 2017 Kenneth Cole Productions closed the balance of their outlet stores to pursue its e-commerce business.  Criticism  Kenneth Cole Productions has occasionally experienced difficulty adequately staffing its stores in order to properly rotate employees through mandatory rest and meal breaks. For example, on April 16, 2007, the Supreme Court of California unanimously affirmed a trial court judgment requiring the company to pay an additional hour of pay for each day that a store manager had been forced to work a nine-hour shift without a break.Murphy v.

She received her PhD under Hans Eysenck at the Institute of Psychiatry. She taught at the London School of Economics from 1948‚Äì83. From 1964 she was the first Professor of Social Psychology in Britain, founding LSE's social psychology department (now named the Department of Psychological and Behavioural Science) and, in effect, establishing the discipline on the university curriculum. She retired in 1983 and died of cancer in 1989. Research She greatly enhanced our understanding of the contemporary world through her research, in particular through two studies. As director of the Nuffield Foundation television inquiry from 1954-58 she contributed to the understanding of television's impact in society, the subsequent book Television and the Child (1958) establishing her reputation in Europe and North America. Her work in the field of political psychology greatly strengthened the understanding of human decision-making by voters as she and her team studied a group of young people over a 15-year period. The study was published as How Voters Decide in 1981. Hilde Himmelweit was also highly influential in advocating a societal psychology, on which topic she co-edited a volume with George Gaskell, as well as in the establishment and development of the theory of social representations.

Alexyev (Alexeieff) unlikely initials \\"J.X.\\"; this is probably a typo resulting from transcribing a handwritten text. ln addition to his Professorship, Alexeev became the Curator and Senior Researcher at the Asiatic Museum. In that role, he contributed a paper on Chinese folklore to a 1918 Museum symposium, published by its parent group, the Russian Academy of Sciences. Alexeev's situation at this time, though perilous like everybody else's, had great potential, which he quickly proceeded to realize. His position at the Museum gave him a realia basis: he had custody of artifacts for the study of Chinese popular tradition, including a large trove of Dunhwang documents brought back from a Russian expedition of 1914-1915. In 1919, Alexeev became associate editor, and chief of the Eastern division, of the newly founded Publishing House for World Literature. This provided a publishing outlet. Under his direction, the Museum's Sinological library was expanded, catalogued, and systematically employed in research, by a team of young persons Alexeev gradually gathered around him, among them the brilliant Shchutsky. Alekseyev has produced an acclaimed translation of the Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio. The first volume was published in 1922 under the title Fox's Wiles. According to Tatyana Tolstaya, \\"academician Alekseyev has found a special way of selecting and connecting Russian words which creates a distinctive brand of the Russian language, the one with a unique crystal grid, so to speak.

Comparisons of morphological characters and DNA sequences have shown that Allenanthus is embedded in Machaonia. This was confirmed by a molecular phylogenetic study of the subfamily Cinchonoideae in 2010. Because of these results, Allenanthus is no longer maintained as a separate genus.

Pierce House, in Boise's North End at 1805 N. 21st Street, served that role from 1947 to 1989. From 2009 until 2013, the former home of billionaire agribusiness magnate J. R. Simplot (1909‚Äì2008) and his wife Esther Simplot, served as the Governor's official residence, although the house remained unoccupied; during this period, it was officially known as Idaho House. Citing upkeep costs, the state returned the house to the Simplot family in 2013; it was demolished in January 2016, although its substantial flagpole remains. Background In 1995, the Idaho Legislature formed a Governor's Housing Committee and Residence Fund \\"for the purpose of providing a Governor's housing allowance and/or the acquisition, construction, remodel, furnishing, equipping, or maintaining a Governor's residence.\\" In 1999, the Legislature amended Idaho law to allow the Governor's Housing Committee \\"to accept grants, gifts, or donations related to a governor's residence.\\" The Simplot mansion J. R. Simplot, once among the 100 richest Americans, bought of undeveloped land in the Boise foothills in 1947 for five dollars an acre. Thirty-two years later in 1979, he built a Mediterranean-style villa on the land, located at 4000 Simplot Lane, on the top of a prominent hill in what had become the Highlands neighborhood of North Boise. The hill's elevation is about above sea level, north of and over above adjacent Bogus Basin Road. The main level of the home consisted of two bedrooms, two and a half bathrooms, a library, a main kitchen and caterer's kitchen, and a board room/dining room, while the upper level consisted of an office, bathroom, entertainment area and great room/formal dining room. The property included a house and a garage. The house was visible for miles, and was dubbed \\"Fort Simplot\\" by neighbors who said it resembled a Boy Scout camp. A flagpole flying a American flag was erected in 1980. Neighbors soon complained that the noise from the flag disturbed their sleep at night; Simplot responded by raising the flagpole to . A mudslide from the slopes of the hill in 1983 caused $20,000 in damage to an adjacent home. Simplot gave the property to the state government on December 21, 2004, to serve as a residence for future governors after his own death, on the sole condition that a massive American flag continue to fly above the home. Dirk Kempthorne, governor at the time of the donation, accepted Simplot's donation of the $2.1 million property in 2004 and launched a $3 million private fund raising effort to renovate the interior. He also planned to sell naming rights to various rooms to make the house a showcase for Idaho industry, but Kempthorne resigned in June 2006 to become Secretary of the Interior and the plans were never implemented under his short-term successor, Jim Risch. The state's next governor, Butch Otter, was a former executive with the Simplot Company. He had divorced Simplot's daughter Gay in 1993, and declined to live in the mansion that his former father-in-law had built. In the 2006 gubernatorial election, Otter's Democratic opponent Jerry Brady called the house \\"too gaudy for a governor.\\" Simplot died at age 99 in 2008; the following year, some state legislators suggested selling the thirty-year- old home, using the proceeds to build a new mansion on state-owned residential property nearby. In January 2009, it was reported that a fund-raising campaign for the mansion had \\"sputtered\\" and that the cost of maintaining the lawn, $100,000 a year, was depleting funds. Otter and his wife Lori lived on their ranch west of the city near Star and received a state housing allowance of $58,000 per year, causing controversy. The Idaho Statesman editorialized that \\"It is ridiculous to subsidize his living expenses.\\" Otter said he would stop taking the allowance once the state finished minimal renovations to the mansion, but would still not live there. In 2013, the state government returned ownership of the property to the Simplot family due to the cost of its maintenance. Again citing maintenance costs, the family announced on January 4, 2016, that the house would be demolished. Demolition of the mansion began the same day, and was completed within a week. The Simplot family has not disclosed any plans for the site.

It was designed by Savoia-Marchetti as a replacement for its successful SM.79, and shared its three-engine layout. Despite entering service with the Regia Aeronautica in 1941, it was retired from service before the SM.79 and never fully replaced it. Development Development of an aircraft to replace the SM.79 started in 1939, with Savoia-Marchetti choosing to produce an improved development of the SM.79, using the same wing as its predecessor, but with a new fuselage and more powerful engines. The first prototype flew on 5 June 1940, just 5 days before Italy's entry into World War II. It was hoped to replace the SM.79s in service, which were fast, but obsolescent, and yet to be adapted as torpedo bombers. The main improvement was the adoption of new and more powerful engines, giving a total output of 2,237 kW (3,000 hp). The machine was put into series production at the end of 1940. Design Basically it was an enhanced SM.79, with more modern solutions and systems.For all this paragraph, see Lembo, Daniele: S.84, il fratello stupido dello Sparviero, Aerei nella storia magazine n.24, Westward editions, pag.10‚Äì32. It shared the basic design of a three-engine mixed construction monoplane as the SM.79. Wood was used for the wings, supported by three spars. Steel tubing was used as a skeleton for the fuselage, covered by metal (forward), fabric and wood. The new fuselage housed a crew of five to six, with the pilots sitting side-by-side. Behind them there were a radio-operator and flight engineer. There was a large windscreen and eight windows in the fuselage. The armour was much improved compared to the almost nonexistent protection fitted to the SM.79. It was said there was a total of 700 kg (1,540 lb) fitted, but it is unclear if this also included the self-sealing fuel tanks, bullet-proofed up to 12.7 mm (.50 in) rounds. One noticeable difference was the twin tail, which gave a better field of fire to the dorsal gun, and helped to cope with the greater power and weight compared to the SM.79. Armament was similar to the Cant Z.1007, rather than the SM.79. There was a dorsal Caproni-Lanciani Delta turret, with a 12.7 mm (.50 in) Scotti machine gun, and 350 rounds. Another Scotti was in the ventral gondola. Other two Scotti were in the flanks with six 120-round belts. It was a theoretical improvement, though Scotti machine guns, even with a slightly higher rate of fire, were much less reliable than the Breda. Another disadvantage was the inability of the turret to fire directly forward, through the propeller's blades, so the aircraft had no defence from frontal attacks. The bomb bay was in the middle of the fuselage. Horizontally mounted, the aircraft could carry two 500 kg (1,100 lb), three 250 kg (550 lb), 10 100 kg (220 lb), or 10 50 kg (110 lb) bombs. Outside the fuselage it was possible to mount two 500 kg (1,102 lb) or 800 kg (1,760 lb) bombs, or two torpedoes, or multiple smaller bombs. Generally, the aircraft carried only one torpedo or around 1,000 kg (2,200 lb) of bombs. The aiming apparatus was a Jozza U3, fitted in the bombardier's nacelle, just below the cockpit. It was retractable when not in use, to reduce drag. An OMI camera was fitted in the fuselage, while in the tail section it was possible to mount one of three different cameras, like the AGR.90 or 91. Three Piaggio P.XI RC.40 engines, giving 746 kW (1,000 hp) at 4,000 m (13,120 ft) were fitted. There were 16 self-sealing fuel tanks inside the wing and the fuselage, six for the central engine (1,070 L/283 US gal) and five for each wing engine (1,095 L/289 US gal). Total fuel load was 3,260 L (860 US gal), which was less, despite the more powerful engines, than previous Italian bombers. It was possible, however, to mount another three fuel tanks: two of 415 L (110 US gal) in the fuselage, and one of 2,500 L (661 US gal) in the bomb-bay. With these engines, at full load the SM.84 was capable of:Lembo, Daniele, op cit. * 400 km/h (250 mph) at 1,000 m (3,280 ft). * 418 km/h (260 mph) at 2,000 m (6,560 ft). * 437 km/h (272 mph) at 3,000 m (9,840 ft). * 456 km/h (283 mph) at 4,000 m (13,120 ft). * 467 km/h (290 mph) at 5,000 m (16,400 ft). * 450 km/h (280 mph) at 6,000 m (19,690 ft).

The maximum practical ceiling was 8,200 m (26,900 ft). At 5,500 m (18,050 ft) and 397 km/h (247 mph), it had 5 hour 17 minutes endurance, and a range of 2,040 km (1,270 mi). As was expected, the performance of the SM.84 was superior to the SM.79. Operational history The first unit to operate the aircraft was 12¬∞ Stormo (Wing), 41¬∞ Gruppo (Group), on 2 February 1941. Based at Rodi, the first actions of this Group were not successful, and two aircraft landed in Turkey being lost (their crews later returned to Rodi).Lembo, Daniele: SM.84 36¬∞ Stormo (108 and 109 Gr) received its SM.84s on 7 May 1941, and was based at Decimomannu airbase, Sardinia, from September 1941. On 27 September 1941, 12 aircraft of 36¬∞ Stormo took off to attack a British convoy to Malta (Operation Halberd). One aircraft turned back after developing a mechanical fault, but the remainder pressed on with their attack. The first group, led by Arduino Buri, attacked the British ships and Buri managed to torpedo , putting her out of action for six months. Of the first section, one aircraft was shot down, and the second section had two aircraft shot down out of three. When Seidl went in with his five aircraft, he was shot down together with another two. While the damage to Nelson was a success, the only one of this type that Italian torpedo bombers obtained, it was paid for by the loss of six aircraft, and almost all their crews, more than thirty men. The next day a merchant ship, Empire Pelican, was sunk by SM.79s with only one loss. The rest of the convoy reached Malta with their supplies. After these losses, 36¬∞ Stormo continued in its task of attacking enemy ships and sank the merchant ship Empire Defender in November, and 9 SM.84s badly damaged on 9 April 1942.Lembo, Daniele: SM.84 see bibliography; however, this was not necessarily done with torpedoes, as SM.84s were used also with bombs 282a Squadriglia was also involved in such missions, with some success. 7¬∞ Stormo (4¬∞ and 5¬∞ Gruppo), based in Sicily, used SM.84s to bomb Malta in July 1941. In mid-October 1941, 32¬∞ Stormo were equipped with SM.84s, one group of torpedo bombers and the other of bombers, to best optimize the attack against ships. This Wing took part in attacks on the Allied landings of Operation Torch, but by the end of December the unit had lost 20 aircraft and was retired from operations.Lembo, Daniele: SM.84. During Spring and Summer 1942, 4¬∞ Gruppo Autonomo Bombardamento Terrestre flew bombing sorties against targets in Malta, suffering painful losses. On 12 May, three SM.84 from 14a Squadriglia (plus four Junkers Ju 88), escorted by Italian and German fighters, attacked Ta' Qali airfield.Rogers 2000, p. 155. All Savoia-Marchetti bombers were hit hard by Spitfires and Hurricanes based on the besieged island. RAF pilots claimed two SM.84s (mistaken for CANT Z.1007s) destroyed. Actually the Savoia flown by pilot Tenente Vinicio Vego Scocco was shot down. Three Italian airmen parachuted but none survived: one drowned and two were massacred at the foot of the cliff where they had landed.Rogers 2000, p. 156. In June 1942, nine bombers of same 4¬∞ Gruppo plus 14 torpedo bombers of 36¬∞ Stormo attacked the Malta convoy of Operation Harpoon, with at least two losses to Spitfires, and one downed by Anti-aircraft fire. 4¬∞ Gruppo suffered more losses on July 4, 1942, when three SM.84s flew back to Malta to bomb the Luqa airport. The Italian trimotors were escorted by numerous Messerschmitt Bf 109s, Macchi C.202s and Reggiane Re.2001s. But, diving out of the sun and from a superior height, the Spitfires of the No. 249 Squadron RAF managed to infiltrate the dense escort of the Axis fighters and to hit hard the Savoia-Marchettis (again, exchanged for CANT Z.1007), claiming all three shot down. During that sortie, 4¬∞ Gruppo suffered two losses: a SM.84 crashed offshore, possibly the one piloted by Tenente Raffaele Notari, from 15a Squadriglia. A second Savoia- Marchetti, piloted by Sergente Maggiore Romolo Cristiani, of the 14a Squadriglia, crashed on Ta' Garda. The third SM.84, although it had been repeatedly hit, managed to fly back to Sicily.Rogers 2000, pp. 176-180. During Operation Pedestal in August 1942, 10 SM.84s used special Motobomba circling torpedoes to attack the convoy, losing two aircraft to enemy fighters. Aircraft of 32¬∞ and 36¬∞ Wing also attacked the convoy. The heavy German and Italian attacks, including those by SM.82s resulting in only five of the fourteen ships of the convoy reaching Malta, however their supplies were fundamental to saving the garrison, after the almost total failure of the previous operation. While other groups were still receiving the aircraft, 36¬∞ and 7¬∞ Wing had stopped flying it by October 1942, while 32¬∞ went in action against North African targets. It lost 20 aircraft and returned in Apulia to regroup in December 1942. Soon 38¬∞ Gr had the new SM.84 Bis (early 1943), this last version was delivered to 8¬∞ Stormo (27¬∞ and 28¬∞ Gruppos). The decline had already started. The use of the aircraft with 8¬∞ Stormo to resupply troops in North Africa was a failure: despite having a far higher speed than the SM.82, the useful payload of the SM.84 was too small. The aircraft was gradually phased out, replaced by the Cant Z.1007, and even the SM.79. By 10 July 1943 43¬∞ Wing, flying from Gioia del Colle, in Apulia, was the only unit still flying the SM.84. In September 1943, despite the almost extinction of bombers units, there were still 150 SM.84s in available, with over 100 serviceable. Almost all of these were captured by the Germans, though they were rarely used. Some were sent to the Slovensk√© vzdu≈°n√© zbrane, and 10 remained with RSI's Aeronautica Nazionale Repubblicana, but were not used. Seven were used by the Italian Co-Belligerent Air Force as transports. Shortly after the end of the war, the aircraft was phased out of service. Overall, SM.84 was a failed design (Francesco Pricolo called it a 'wrong aircraft', while Ettore Muti complained in 1941 about its awful handling and take off). It was never liked by its crews and never capable of replacing the SM.79. When the final version of the Sparviero, the SM.79 bis, became available, the SM.84 was withdrawn. In the bomber role it was inferior to the CANT.1007 ter, especially at altitude (the SM.84 was almost impossible to fly above 5,000 m). Torpedo- bombers were required to be agile and fast in order to engage their targets and many designs experienced problems with higher weights and wing loading than they were designed for. The SM.84 was far heavier than the SM.79 and when the final version the SM.79bis became available, it was preferred to the SM.84. The SM.79bis, with improved engines was still lighter than the SM.84 and a better aircraft (with lower wing loading and better power-to weight ratio) for the role.Sgarlato, Nico: S.79 Sparviero, Delta Edition may 2006 p.32 Another critical report about SM.84 came from the 43¬∞ Stormo B.T. command, in an official document.Marcon, Tullio: I bombardieri italiani, Storia Militare, Albertelli Editions, Parma, oct 2006 pp. 11‚Äì12 It reports how this bomber wing performed its task, starting with bombing missions from Gioia del Colle on 13 July 1943. The 41¬∞ Stormo commander complained the very small attack force was not enough to saturate the enemy's strong defences, even by night; the small number of pilots trained for night operations and thus the small number of sorties and the very poor performance of the SM.84. Variants ;S.84bis: With several modifications, but not a substantial evolution. ;S.84ter: A single aircraft, completed in 1944, fitted with 1,119 kW (1,500 hp) Piaggio P.XII engines, capable of speeds over 500 km/h (310 mph).

It was amalgamated with the civil parish of Woodhall Spa in 1987. History Kirkstead has its origins in a Cistercian monastery, Kirkstead Abbey (the name Kirkstead means \\"the site of a church\\" ) founded in 1139 by Hugh Brito, lord of Tattershall and originally colonised by an abbot and twelve monks from Fountains Abbey in Yorkshire. It was around this abbey that the little settlement of Kirkstead grew. The abbey remained in existence until 1537, when it was dissolved and Richard Harrison (the last Abbot) and three of his monks were executed by King Henry VIII following their implication (probably unjustly) in the Lincolnshire Rising of the previous year. The abbey and manor of Kirkstead passed to the Duke of Suffolk, Henry VIII's brother-in-law, and later to the Clintons, Earls of Lincoln, who built a large country house. By 1791 that too had gone, and all that remains today is a dramatic crag of masonry - a fragment of the south transept wall of the abbey church and the earthworks of the vast complex of buildings that once surrounded it. The church of St Leonard's Without, thus named as it was outside the gates of the abbey, stands in a field by the side of the ruins of the abbey. Built between 1230 and 1240 it is an excellent example of the Early English style. Measuring only by it is up to \\"Cathedral standards\\" and may well have been built as a chantry chapel in memory of Robert de Tattershall who died in 1212. After many centuries use as a church, it closed in 1877, when a Presbyterian congregation was evicted, and from 1883 \\"The Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings\\" fought to save it from total decay. Eventually during 1913 and 1914 it was restored by the architect Weir. Kirkstead remained an isolated hamlet, but the area by the River Witham, 'Kirkstead Wharfs' developed as a locally important trading point on the canal system for goods being imported and exported in the local area, including coal. With the opening in 1848 of the Lincoln to Boston line of the London and York Railway, a station was built here which was the nearest station to the increasingly fashionable spa town of Woodhall Spa, away. The resulting carriage trade, carrying the gentry to and from the spa, lasted until 1855 when a branch line opened from Kirkstead Station, (which then became known as Woodhall Junction) to Woodhall Spa and Horncastle. Woodhall Spa and Horncastle stations were closed to passengers in 1954, and Woodhall Junction closed with the closure of its railway line in 1970. The arrival of the railways greatly decreased the isolation of Kirkstead and the surrounding area. Kirkstead Wharfs was absorbed by the encroaching civil parish of Woodhall Spa in 1894, and the rest was incorporated into it in 1987, so that Kirkstead is now the western part of Woodhall Spa between the village centre and the River Witham. Kirkstead Bridge The Kirkstead Bridge is a concrete arch bridge spanning the River Witham at Kirkstead in Woodhall Spa. It carries the B1191 as it runs from Horncastle to the A15 road just north of Dunsby St Andrew and was finished and opened in 1968. The bridge replaced an existing swing bridge alongside it, which had itself replaced a ferry which operated until the early 20th century.

Cardigan Bay to the west and the surrounding hilly geography made it difficult for foreign invaders to conquer. Its area corresponded roughly to that of the county of Ceredigion.Lloyd, J.E., A History of Wales; From the Norman Invasion to the Edwardian Conquest Ceredigion transparently means \\"the people of Ceredig.\\" Ceredigion, A Wealth of History History Medieval Wales Tradition found in the work of Nennius, a 9th-century Welsh chronicler, traces Ceredigion's foundation to Ceredig, son of Cunedda.Davies, John, A History of Wales According to Nennius, Cunedda migrated with his sons and followers from the Hen Ogledd (southern Scotland) in the 5th century. In pre-Roman, and possibly Roman times, a part of southern Ceredigion was in the territory of the Demetae and possibly part of that of the Ordovices. In post-Roman times, however, there is no evidence that the Kingdom of Dyfed included any part of Ceredigion. Modern Ceredigion corresponds almost exactly to the ancient kingdom of Ceredigion. This name is derived from an adjective Cereticianus, itself a derivative of the proper name Cereticus (Cere- dig), known as the son of Cunedda. Though modern Ceredigion corresponds very closely to the old kingdom of Ceredigion, yet it would appear that, in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, certain places in Carmarthenshire, situated in the Vale of Cothi, in Cantref Mawr, and far south of the county boundary of the Teifi, were sometimes spoken of as being in Cardiganshire (Ceredigion). The Chronicon of Adam of Usk states that the cwmwd of Caio (properly Cynwyl Caio) was situated \\"in Comitatu di Cardikan.\\" In the Charter of Talley Abbey, Brechfa is also spoken of as \\"Lanteilau Brechfa apud Keredigaun.\\" These statements may be simply mistakes, or they may be echoes of the fact that the kings of Ceredigion conquered Y Cantref Mawr in, the eighth century. The same authority on Welsh topography also deals with the statement given in the Life of St. Carannog, that the River Gwaun, which flows into the sea at Abergwaun (Fishguard), formed the southern boundary of the kingdom, and shows that in an older version of the same, the Teifi is represented more correctly as the southern boundary. The substitution of the Gwaun for the Teifi, is due to the inclusion, in 1291, of the deaneries of Cemaes and Emlyn with Ceredigion, in the Archdeaconry of Cardigan.Archaeologia Cambrensis References Other reading * Archaeologia Cambrensis, By Cambrian Archaeological Association, Published by W.

Breast cancer awareness month is a yearly campaign that intend educate people about the importance of early screening, test and more.

The aim of the NBCAM from the start has been to promote mammography as the most effective weapon in the fight against breast cancer. In 1993 Evelyn Lauder, Senior Corporate Vice President of the Est√©e Lauder Companies, founded The Breast Cancer Research Foundation and established the pink ribbon as its symbol, though this was not the first time the ribbon was used to symbolize breast cancer: a 68-year-old California woman named Charlotte Haley, whose sister, daughter, and granddaughter had breast cancer, had distributed peach-color ribbons to call attention to what she perceived as inadequate funding for research. In the fall of 1991, the Susan G. Komen Foundation had handed out pink ribbons to participants in its New York City race for breast cancer survivors.

In 1996, with the screening program and study complete, Zeneca Inc. analyzed the total monetary amounts lost due to the increase in health care provided compared with the total monetary amounts lost if the company was to scrap the program were compared. The total costs to the company of running the early detection program were estimated to be $400,000. Total costs to the company if they chose not to run the program were estimated to be around $1.5 million. Pezzullo (2003) \\"(Astra)Zeneca‚Äôs initial justification for NBCAM was one of basic accounting, not a critique of how women‚Äôs healthcare has been assessed or implemented nor a desire to prevent women from developing breast cancer; instead, it was cost-effective for a company to detect cancer in its employees during the disease‚Äôs earlier stages.\\" Critics have said that \\"the BCAM idea 'was conceived and paid for by a British chemical company that both profits from this epidemic and may be contributing to its cause...'\\".Janette D.

Biography Leoniceno was born in Lonigo, Veneto, the son of a doctor. He studied Greek in Vicenza under Ognibene da Lonigo (in Latin: Omnibonus Leonicenus) (Lonigo, 1412 ‚Äì Vicenza, 1474). Around 1453 he graduated at the University of Padua, where he studied medicine and philosophy under Pietro Roccabonella (died 1491). In 1464, after completing his doctorate, he moved to the University of Ferrara, where he taught mathematics, philosophy and medicine. His students there included Antonio Musa Brassavola. He was a pioneer in the translation of ancient Greek and Arabic medical texts by such authors as Galen and Hippocrates into Latin. In 1493, Leoniceno wrote the first scientific paper on syphilis. He died at Ferrara in 1524. He composed the first criticism of the Natural History of Pliny the Elder. The Ferrara debates Leoniceno‚Äôs stand against Pliny‚Äôs work caught the attention of Angelo Poliziano, the Florentine court humanist. Poliziano wished to defend the standing of the ancient Romans. Furthermore, he did not like the fact that Leoniceno would classify Pliny the Elder with Arab and medieval scholars. Poliziano engaged Pandolfo Collenuccio, a lawyer and historian to defend Pliny against the accusations of Leoniceno. In 1492, Leoniceno published an article entitled De Plinii et plurium aliorum medicorum in medicina erroribus. In this treatise, he \\"pointed out errors in the medical portions of Pliny as well as in the works of 'barbarian' (that is, medieval Arab) physicians.\\" This publication was followed almost immediately by a response from Collenuccio, Pliniana defensio adversus Nicolai Leoniceni accusationem, published in 1493. Between 1492-1509, Leoniceno and Collenuccio published a series of pamphlets in which they argued the relative merits of the ancient sources. In particular, there was concern about the accuracy of Pliny‚Äôs translations and transliterations from the original Greek into Latin. Even Collenuccio conceded that translation issues did exist. Already, the 15th-century commentator \\"Barbaro, claimed to have corrected some five-thousand errors in the two earlier editions.\\" The primary difference in the substance of the argument centered around who was responsible for the errors. Leoniceno refused to attribute inaccuracies solely to scribes who had copied the manuscripts over time. By taking this position, Leoniceno was challenging Pliny directly. It was this position that prompted such a strong response from Collenuccio and others. Leoniceno‚Äôs attack on Pliny did not focus exclusively on translation issues. He also cited a section of Book 2 of Pliny‚Äôs natural history in which Pliny stated that the moon was larger than the earth. In Leoniceno‚Äôs opinion, if Pliny had erred on such a fundamental fact, then that error justified a further examination of his work for other errors. He proceeded to point out his concern over Pliny‚Äôs discussion of hedera, which Pliny claimed had both a male and female version. ‚ÄúThis distinction ‚Äòis made neither by Theophrastus, nor by Dioscorides, nor by any man of weighty authority about the hedera, but it is clearly described in cinthus.‚Äô‚Äù In this example, Leoniceno is referring to the Greek names for the two plants, hedera is kissos and cithon (or cinthus) is kisthos. While Pliny may have confused the two plants in his manuscript, Leoniceno was concerned that this confusion was the result of lack of experience with the two plants. Leoniceno felt that had Pliny had adequate firsthand experience with the actual plants, he would have avoided this error. Texts and experience This emphasis on experience constitutes a fundamental shift in the way in which natural history knowledge was accumulated. Traditionally, knowledge was gained by studying the ancient texts and applying the information and formulas found there. Leoniceno‚Äôs approach was novel because he suggested that the knowledge of the ancients should be verified by comparing the texts to firsthand observations of the plants that ancient writers described. This approach, while novel, faced several obstacles. First, there was the issue of translation. While Barbaro‚Äôs study resolved the philological issues, there was still the question of how to approach the contradictions that translation errors produced. Leoniceno maintained that if Pliny was found to be in error, one should examine the texts of Theophrastus and Dioscorides rather than medieval Arab writers such as Avicenna. Leoniceno‚Äôs preference for Greek authors over Arab authors was one of the distinguishing characteristics of his efforts to reform medical pedagogy in the early modern period. In addition to translation errors, early modern naturalists were faced with the dilemma of ensuring that they were identifying plants correctly. Was the plant they called hedera the same plant that the ancients called hedera? While this may seem simple to resolve, one must remember that quite often, they worked strictly from written descriptions of plants. At this time, naturalists had not developed a standardized descriptive vocabulary. This lack of standardized vocabulary was further complicated by the fact that plants differ in their physical characteristics throughout their lifecycle. Materia medica Galeni Ars medicinalis Nicolao Leoniceno interprete, 1537 While Poliziano and Collenuccio were concerned primarily with defending the prestige of the ancients, Leoniceno‚Äôs concerns were far more practical. Specifically, Leoniceno was concerned that errors in translation would lead to errors in identification of specific plants. A physician by training, Leoniceno was concerned that inaccuracies in Pliny‚Äôs translations would result in inaccurate medicinal preparations based on Pliny‚Äôs work. If Pliny‚Äôs translations were indeed flawed, then Leoniceno felt they should be replaced by the original Greek texts. Both parties to the debate eventually agreed that a detailed reexamination of the ancient texts was the best way to resolve the dispute. As a teacher, the accuracy of medical texts was important to Leoniceno. While he advocated experience as a means of determining the value of the information found in ancient texts, he still focused his examinations of the plants described by the ancients. He was not as interested in identifying new species as later practitioners of natural history would be. He still remained focused on verifying existing information rather than expanding the lists of plants found in standard texts. His emphasis on \\"factual accuracy\\" derived from his insistence that \\"the health and life of men depend upon it\\". Leoniceno's library Leoniceno began his career in what has been referred to as the age of the manuscript. At this point in time knowledge was acquired primarily through the examination of existing texts. Leoniceno‚Äôs library was most impressive, and its contents reflected the textual approach to scholarship popular at the time. An inventory taken after his death revealed 345 volumes comprising 482 individual works. Numerous shorter volumes had been combined into one bound volume. Of these 345 volumes, 117 were in Greek. Among the volumes were numerous versions and translations of a single work, along with numerous commentaries on the same work. As such, the contents of Leoniceno's library further reflected the textual approach to knowledge that served as the foundation of his scholarship.

The monastery was founded in 1139 by Hugh Brito, (or Hugh son of Eudo), lord of Tattershall, and was originally colonised by an abbot and twelve monks from Fountains Abbey in Yorkshire. The original site was not large enough however, and Robert, son of Hugh, found a better site a short distance away in 1187. The 1187 date is probably completion of the Abbey, as the architecture dates it to around 1175. The monks were granted the lordship of Wildmore by the lords of Bolingbroke, Scrivelsby and Horncastle, although they did retain the right of common pasture for themselves and their tenants. The abbey remained in existence until 1537, when it was dissolved; the last abbot, Richard Harrison, and three of his monks were executed by Henry VIII following their implication (probably unjustly) in the Lincolnshire Rising of the previous year. The land passed to the Duke of Suffolk and later to the Clinton Earls of Lincoln, who built a large country house. By 1791 that too had gone and all that remains today is a dramatic crag of masonry - a fragment of the south transept wall of the abbey church - and the earthworks of the vast complex of buildings that once surrounded it, which is Grade I listed, and an ancient scheduled monument.

It is found in Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. It is threatened by habitat loss. Dutch botanist Herman Sleumer described this species as Embothrium brachycarpum in 1939 before transferring it to the genus Oreocallis. However the fruit of the type specimen were deformed and the species in fact has the largest fruit of the genus. Peter Weston and Mike Crisp of the Royal Botanic Gardens in Sydney reviewed and recognised the Australasian members of the genus Oreocallis as distinct from their South American counterparts, and hence reallocated them to the new genus Alloxylon in 1991. Local native names include kawoli in Merauke, and anga in Trangan. Alloxylon brachycarpum grows as a tree reaching 20‚Äì40 m high, with a rough, flaking grey to brown trunk. The adult leaves are simple and oval shaped, measuring 6‚Äì15 cm long by 2.5‚Äì5 cm wide with entire margins. The orange-red flower heads each contain 8 to 25 individual flowers arranged in racemes. These are followed by the development of the leathery seed pods, or fruit, up to 14 cm long and 2.5 cm wide, each of which contain 10-14 winged seeds in two rows. It resembles the Australian species A. flammeum, which has longer, narrower leaves and brighter flowers. Alloxylon brachycarpum is found in dry rainforest and eucalypt-bamboo forest in southern New Guinea, along the Upper Merauke River, Lower Fly River and Oriomo River, and in the Aru Islands.

Description Leaves and male inflorescences of Alnus acuminata Alnus acuminata grows up to tall with a straight trunk up to thick. The bark has many yellowish lenticels. The leaves are simple, oval with toothed margins. The inflorescences are catkins, separate male and female flowers on the same tree. The male flowers are up to long and pendulous, while the smaller female flowers are green, erect and resemble a small cone. After wind fertilisation, the female flowers develop into long dehiscent, woody brown fruits. There are 80 to 100 winged seeds per fruit, and these are liberated when ripe, leaving the dried out fruit husks on the tree. There are three subspecies: Alnus acuminata subsp. acuminata occurs from Colombia and Venezuela south to northern Argentina; Alnus acuminata subsp. arguta (Schltdl.) Furlow occurs from northwestern Mexico south to Panama; and Alnus acuminata subsp. glabrata (Fernald) Furlow occurs in central and southern Mexico.Kew World Checklist of Selected Plant Families Distribution and habitat Alnus acuminata grows at altitudes between in the mountain ranges in tropical Central and South America from Mexico to northern Argentina. It mostly grows on areas with 1000‚Äì3000 mm of rainfall, on slopes and valleys. It tolerates poor soils and acid conditions, but prefers silt or sandy silt soils. It is a fast-growing tree, a pioneer species used for watershed protection and can be used for soil improvement because it has root nodules that fix nitrogen. Timber The timber is light to mid reddish-brown and fine grained. It is used for building bridges and pilings, for making coffins, boxes, crates, furniture and plywood. It also makes a good firewood that burns steadily. References External links * World Conservation Monitoring Centre 1998. Alnus acuminata. 2006 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.

Alnus maritima is endemic to the United States, and is found naturally in three disjunct populations in Oklahoma, Georgia, and in Maryland and Delaware on the Delmarva Peninsula. Alnus maritima is the only autumn-blooming member of the genus Alnus native to North America. All other North American alders bloom in the spring. The autumn- blooming phenology is a characteristic that Alnus maritima shares with two old-world Alnus species, Alnus nitida and Alnus nepalensis, which are endemic to southeast Asia. This profound similarity in their timing of anthesis has led to their classification as the only three members in the subgenus Clethropsis. Taxonomy In 2002, the three populations were recognized as subspecies and given the names Alnus maritima subsp. oklahomensis, Alnus maritima subsp. georgiensis, and Alnus maritima subsp. maritima, respectively. While some believe that subspecies maritima is the oldest of the three subspecies and that the other two disjunct populations resulted from some form of long distance dispersal, evidence from morphometric and phylogeographic studies indicates that the Oklahoma population (subsp. oklahomensis) is in fact the most ancestral and that the species probably had a wide, continuous distribution across the United States in the past.

It is commonly called Clanwilliam aloe) and is endemic to South Africa. Description Typically, Aloe comosa has thick, succulent leaf blades approximately 2 feet (0.6 metres) long. The leaves are lanceolate with a glabrous surface. The edges of the leaves are entire, curved upwards (involute) and lined with spiny, tooth-like, brown-red thorns. The fleshy blades have a whorled leaf insertion as they emerge from the rosette which is at the end of an erect stem. Aloe comosa is considered a tree aloe, having a single, unbranched stem which may attain heights of approximately 3 m. As it matures and grows in height, it retains its dry, dead leaves which form a tangled mass resembling a skirt or a beard. Tree aloe bark differs from woody dicot bark in that it does not have a phellogen, which is the meristematic tissue that differentiates into bark. In essence, aloe bark is actually overlapping, irregular layers of incomplete bark tissues. A study in 1983 considered the purpose of retaining dead leaves by several species of tree aloe. Previous ideas were that dead-leaf retention protected bare bark from the sun during the day and the cold at night or that the thorny mass of leaves could deter unwanted wild life in search for water, nectar, or seeds. It was proposed that dead-leaf retention was selected to provide thick, fire resistant bark in a fire-prone habitat. =Reproduction= Naturally, Aloe comosa follows the typical angiosperm life cycle. Like most South African aloes, it blooms in the summer. Tall inflorescences (flower stems) that can reach 2 meters (6.7 feet) in height branch from the rosette. At the tips of the inflorescences are flower spikes which are composed of many small, tightly compacted flowers. In most cases the color of the flower spikes ranges from rosy-cream to ivory-pink and is pale at the bottom of the spike with a darker pink hue on the upper parts. Pollination is carried out primarily by bees, although it is plausible that some evening moths could be pollinating this species as well. The seeds are produced in late February and early March of each year in time for the winter rains; the seasonal shift in the southern hemisphere is opposite that of the northern hemisphere. Once the seed capsules turn pale green, they will split and expose their flat, brown seeds. These seeds are enclosed by a thin, transparent membrane which aid in transporting the seeds. In the event of a sufficient breeze, the seeds are dispersed and blown some distance from the parent plant where they usually germinate under the protection of a nurse plant. Taxonomy Aloe comosa is the botanical name for what is commonly known as Clanwilliam aloe. The person who discovered the species has not been recorded but those that contributed its botanical name were two German botanists, Alwin Berger and Hermann Wilhelm Rudolf Marloth, whom specialized in South African botany and the nomenclature of succulent plants. Distribution Aloe comosa inhabits a very small region within the Western Cape province of South Africa. It was discovered in the Olifants River Valley in 1905, north of the town Clanwilliam (hence its common name). Uses The genus Aloe currently consists of over 400 species. A few species of aloe are used to treat minor thermal burns, itching, and sunburn by applying the thick, mucilaginous gel to the skin, but Aloe comosa is not one of those species. Its only apparent uses are a decorative house plant and collector's item. Even though Aloe comosa is indigenous to the Western Cape of South Africa, it is possible for experienced collectors and horticulturalists to maintain their plants outdoors, in Arizona and California for instance, or in a desert climate greenhouse.

It is native to arid areas of Angola and Namibia. Description Leaf detail Flower detail The plants form stemless rosettes of up to 30 cm wide. Smaller suckers sometimes offshoot from the main stem. The long sharp, triangular leaves are dark brownish green with white linear spots and cartilaginous margins. Tall, very thin multi-branched inflorescences appear from January to March, with small sparse pale pink and sometimes bluish flowers. It is named after German botanist Kurt Dinter. Taxonomically, it was formerly part of the Serrulatae series of three very closely related Aloe species, together with Gonialoe variegata and Gonialoe sladeniana. Recent phylogenetic studies have shown these three species to constitute an entirely separate genus, what was published under the name Gonialoe. While this species looks rather similar to its two sister species, it can be distinguished from Gonialoe sladeniana by its longer leaves which curve downwards, and it can be distinguished from Gonialoe variegata by its large size, taller thinner sparser inflorescence, and the spots on its leaves being more linear, almost to the point of being stripes. The bracts of G.dinteri are 3 nerved, unlike its sister species which are 1 nerved. G.dinteri also has an unusually large root stock; its roots form a far larger percentage of its body weight than all the rest of the plant put together. Distribution Gonialoe dinteri distribution, in red Gonialoe dinteri is found in sparse populations across a large arid area of Namibia and around the verges of the Namib desert. It usually occurs in deep cracks in limestone or granite rock, or growing under scrub. It is listed in the IUCN Red List under the species synonym Aloe dinteri. What little rain there is in this area, tends to fall in the summer. Towards the south, as the climate gradually gives way to a winter-rainfall climate, Gonialoe dinteri is replaced by Gonialoe sladeniana which inhabits the central intermediate zone, and finally by Gonialoe variegata even further south where winter-rainfall climate predominates. Cultivation This species can be grown in cultivation, but needs dry conditions and very well-drained porous soil. It is relatively cold-hardy, due to the low nighttime temperatures of its desert habitat. Reynolds, G.W. 1950. The aloes of Southern Africa. Balkema, Cape Town.

It is endemic to arid areas of central Namibia. Description The small, stemless rosettes produce suckers that offshoot from the root, which can eventually form dense clumps. The sharp, triangular green leaves point slightly upwards and form three rows. The leaves are covered in linear white spots, and their narrow white cartilaginous margins are finely notched. Tall, very thin inflorescences appear in January and February, with small sparse pale pink flowers. Taxonomically, it was formerly part of the Serrulatae series of very closely related Aloe species, together with Aloe variegata and Aloe dinteri. Recent phylogenetic studies have shown these three species to possibly constitute an entirely separate genus, with the name Gonialoe. While this species looks rather similar to its two sister species, it can be distinguished from Gonialoe dinteri by its shorter, straighter, less recurved leaves; and it can be distinguished from Gonialoe variegata by its taller thinner sparser inflorescence, by its having far fewer leaves, and by the spots on its leaves being more linear, almost to the point of being stripes. Distribution Gonialoe sladeniana distribution, in orange. The species is endemic to central Namibia, south-west of Windhoek. Here its habitat is rocky quartzite in granite hills & shrubland. This is an arid region of intermediate rainfall, between the winter-rainfall regions to the south, and the summer rainfall areas to the north. In a gradation of the three sister species, to the north Gonialoe dinteri gradually takes over in the summer rainfall areas. To the south it makes way for Gonialoe variegata in the winter rainfall regions.Reynolds, G.W. 1950. The aloes of Southern Africa. Balkema, Cape Town. References * Loots, S. 2004.

It is situated on the banks of the River Blackwater. In the census of 2016, the population of the village was 276. The village is approximately 8 kilometres from Cappoquin and 20 kilometres from both Dungarvan and Youghal. History Villierstown was founded by the Villiers-Stuart family, from whom the name is derived. In the 1740s the 1st Earl Grandison, John Villiers, established the village to develop a linen industry. The village was initially populated with linen-weavers, some of whom were from Lurgan in Co. Armagh. The original village consisted of a church, a rectory, a school, 24 dwelling houses, a court, a police barracks and a quay on the river. All of these buildings are still in the village today. The church has been converted to a community hall; on its grounds is the Villiers- Stuart's family burial vault where many of its ancestors are buried. During the Famine (1845‚Äì49), the linen industry in Villierstown died out. Some locals turned to fishing on the Blackwater as a source of employment. The majority of villagers were given work by the Villiers-Stuarts on the estate at Dromana, which itself encompassed Villierstown and beyond as far as Dungarvan and Helvick, where the family occasionally resided in the summer. The Villiers- Stuart family were known to be one of the most civic-minded estate holders in Ireland: earlier Lord Stuart de Decies, himself a Protestant, spent much of his political life furthering the cause of Catholic Emancipation with Daniel O'Connell. http://www.vecp.ie/villierstown/history =Dromana House= Ornamental gate lodge to the former Dromana estate. The Villiers-Stuart family and their direct descendants have resided in Dromana House in its different forms for well over 700 years, making it one of the very oldest estates in Ireland prior to the twentieth century. Dromana is perched high above the River Blackwater, located between Villierstown and the town of Cappoquin. Dromana House was originally a medieval castle built by the powerful FitzGerald family, who soon became FitzGerald-Villiers, Villiers, and finally Villiers-Stuart in 1800, at the entry of the Marquis of Bute's son, Henry Stuart, into the family. By the end of the seventeenth century, Dromana House was destroyed after a number of sieges but it was rebuilt. Between the 1750s and 1820s many additions were made to the house including an enormous \\"great bow-sided ballroom.\\" There were also two large walled gardens on the estate, along with the bastion and banqueting house by the river. By the 1820s the Dromana estate was in ownership of . Part of this land today makes up Dromana Wood which is currently being managed by Coillte on a long term lease. In 1965 much of Dromana House was demolished, thus signalling the end of an era, with the estate itself having been liquidated and seized by the Land Commission, in return for near valueless land bonds. Do not miss Thomas Carlyle's lengthy description of his weekend stay at Dromana House in mid-July 1849. His host was Daniel O'Connell's political protege Lord Henry Mount Stuart of the Decries. Reminiscences of My Irish Journey in 1849, Thomas Carlyle, 1882, pp. 88-93. Much of the estate was divided up, while the architecturally significant stables block, just south of the main avenue, was also demolished by the Commission. The avenue, which stretches up to 5 kilometres from Dromana bridge to the Villierstown gate, is now publicly owned while the well-known Hindu Gothic styled gate lodge over the River Finisk is under the responsibility of the local County Council. All that remains today of the house is the smaller 17th-century wing, but not without its historical significance. The family had to sell Dromana House in the 1960s, but they were able to buy it back in the early 1990s. The Villiers-Stuarts still reside in Dromana House today. In August 2004 James Villiers-Stuart died and was buried at Villierstown Church.

The ornate Church of the Third Order of Saint Francis sits adjacent to the convent. The friars of the Franciscan Order arrived in Salvador in 1587 and constructed a convent and church on the site. This structure was destroyed by the Dutch during the Dutch invasions of Bahia in the next century; Father Vicente das Chagas initiated the current structure in 1686, which was completed in the 18th century. The Franciscan church and convent have the largest number of azulejos, 55,000, of any church in Latin America. The convent and its church are important colonial monuments in Brazil. It was listed as a historic structure by the National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage in 1938. The convent, church, and Church of the Third Order are one of the Seven Wonders of Portuguese Origin in the World and form integral parts of the UNESCO World Heritage Site Historic Center of Salvador. History The friars of the Franciscan Order arrived in Salvador in 1587 at the invitation of Dom Ant√¥nio Muniz Barreiros, third Bishop of Bahia. Their arrival in Bahia followed that of the Jesuits, who arrived with Tom√© de Sousa, Brazil's first governor-general, and constructed their college and chapel of the Jesuits 1564. Friar Melchior de Santa Catarina, Custodian Priest of Olinda, sent an appeal in 1585 to Pope Sixtus V to establish a convent on the site. The Franciscans initially settled into various residences and chapels on the site of the present Franciscan church, convent, and Third Order church. Melchior de Santa Catarina sent Ant√¥nio da Ilha and Francisco de S√£o Boaventura, Franciscan brothers, to Salvador the same year; construction of a convent began in 1587. The Franciscans soon built a convent and church, but these were destroyed during the Dutch invasions of Bahia in the 17th century. The works on the current convent began in 1686 under Father Vicente das Chagas following a grandiose design that took decades to complete. Construction on the present- day church and convent began in 1708, as evidenced by the placement of a foundation stone. The structure was completed in 1723. The interior was decorated by several artists during a great part of the 18th century. Most decoration of the church and convent were finished by 1755. The construction of the Church of the Third Order of Saint Francis, located immediately adjacent to the Franciscan church, was carried out in parallel between 1702 and 1870. Structure Nave of the church. Note the exuberant golden woodwork that cover all surfaces Interior of the church Major elements of the church are constructed of Bahian sandstone, including the walls, pilasters, and fa√ßade; some sandstone existed on the Itapagipe Peninsula in the 18th century, but later sandstone elements were brought from Jaguaribe and Velha Boipeba in the interior of Bahia. The eight massive columns that support the choir are of Bahian sandstone and display clasts characteristic of sandstone the region. The church consists of a nave and chancel; transept; choir; lateral corridors; a vestibule which serves as an entrance; a sala do cap√≠tulo, a large cloister; which serves as a meeting room for the order; sacristy; library; and numerous rooms that serve the convent. The Church of S√£o Francisco of Salvador is unusual among Franciscan houses of Northeast Brazil in that it has a nave with three aisles, while most other Franciscan churches of the region have only one aisle. Three lateral chapels are located on each of the lateral aisles. The church has a rectangular shape without protruding transept arms and a main chapel. The floorplan seems influenced by the S√£o Francisco Church of Oporto (actually a Gothic building) and the Jesuit plans of S√£o Roque in Lisbon and the Jesuit Church of Salvador. =Fa√ßade= The main fa√ßade faces a large rectangular square, the Largo do Cruzeiro, with a large stone cross. The fa√ßade shows influences of Mannerist architecture through the Jesuit Church of Salvador, among other buildings. Sandstone from the Boa Viagem quarry, located on the Itapagipe Peninsula, was used for the fa√ßade. The quarry was a donation to the Franciscan fathers. Like the Cathedral of Salvador, it has three portals and two flanking towers. The upper part of the fa√ßade (gable) is flanked by elaborate volutes. The center of the monumental pediment has a statue of Saint Francis of Assisi in white marble. It is now covered in layers of paint and placed in the niche at the end of the first half of the 18th century. A relief of the coats of arms of the Franciscan Order is placed above the statue. The smooth tiles covering the towers are also from a later period and serve further to accentuate the main body of the fa√ßade was originally in dark sandstone. Tiles were added at a later period \\"to accentuate the main body of the fa√ßade\\". =Cruzeiro de S√£o Francisco= A large cross in lioz marble, imported from Lisbon, sits in the broad square in front of the church. A large cross was common to Franciscan churches in Brazil; it demarcated the sacred space of an urban area. The cruzeiro of the S√£o Francisco Church stands on a square base of by . The cross is dated 1807 and has an inscription Latin. The square in front of the S√£o Francisco Church is now named for the cross, and is known as the Largo do Cruzeiro de S√£o Francisco. Despite its location in a public space, the cruzeiro belongs to the Third Order of Saint Francis of Salvador. =Cloister= The cloister of the S√£o Francisco Church and Convent was constructed between 1707 and 1752. It consists of two stories. Stone was ordered from Boipeba Island in present-day Cairu, Bahia, to construct the cloister by Frei Alvaro da Concei√ß√£o. The cloister is circled by arches supported by stone columns. Monumental blue-and-white azulejo tile panels were placed around the entirety of the cloister in the final period of construction; they were inspired by the prints of the Flemish artist Otto van Veen (c.1556 ‚Äì 6 May 1629). The azulejos, 37 in number, depict mythological scenes with moralistic allegories by the Roman poet Horace. The azulejos were manufactured in Portugal, and arrived in Bahia between 1743 and 1746; their installation was completed in 1748. The cloister served as a place for meditation, community gatherings, interior processions, and other liturgical activities. =Sacristy= The sacristy of the S√£o Francisco Church and Convent is located directly behind the high altar and is accessed via chapels to either side of the chancel. It has a massive sacristy cabinet with an altar at center and other carved Baroque furniture. The walls are covered in 17th- century Portuguese azulejos; the ceiling is elaborately coffered. The lavabo is in white and red lioz limestone with the motif of the Franciscan order at center, an image in the niche at top, and elaborate masks motifs at the two taps. Art Crossing and main chapel of the church. Note the wooden panels with paintings on the ceiling. The most important characteristic of the church is its exuberant inner decoration, mostly executed in the first half of the 18th century. All surfaces inside - walls, pillars, vaults and ceilings - are covered by golden sculpted gilt woodwork and paintings. The altarpieces display Solomonic columns and concentric arches decorated with golden foliage, angels and birds, while the vaults of the aisles are covered by wooden panels with paintings. Of particular note are the carvings of eight massive Atlanteans support the lateral altars. Blue-white tile (azulejo) panels, by Bartolomeu Antunes de Jesus and imported from Lisbon, cover the lower parts of the walls of the main chapel and transept and depict scenes of the life of St Francis of Assisi. The decoration of the church is considered one of the most complete and imposing in Portuguese-Brazilian Baroque gilt woodwork art (talha dourada), being a perfect example of the \\"golden church\\" (igreja dourada). The convent of S√£o Francisco is also an important repository of Baroque art. The wooden ceiling of the entrance hall (Portaria) was painted with scenes in illusionistic perspective by Jos√© Joaquim da Rocha in 1774. Protected status The S√£o Francisco Church and Convent was listed as a historic structure by the National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage in 1938. The structure was registered under the Book of Historical Works, Inscription no. 1 and Book of Fine Arts, Inscription no. 11. The directive is dated March 31, 1938. Access The church is open to the public and may be visited. References * da Silva Telles, Augusto Carlos: Atlas dos monumentos hist√≥ricos e art√≠sticos do Brasil.

It aired from 15 February 1980 to 27 February 1981 on TV Asahi. A 15 minutes long \\"movie\\" special called was also created, it aired in Japan in July 1980. Although Eiko Fujiwara is often credited as the \\"creator\\" of the series, Lalabel was actually an original Toei Animation creation, and Fujiwara drew the spin-off manga published by Shogakukan. Masaki Tsuji was brought on board as the series' head writer, but due to various circumstances he scripted only the first episode, and the remaining episodes were given to a rotation of four other writers. Lalabel (sometimes romanized as Lalabelle) would be the last magical girl anime created by Toei Animation until the 1988 remake of Himitsu no Akko-chan. Toei producers believed that girls in the target demographic for series like Lalabel demanded romantic adventures more than magical girl shows, and thus the series that followed in Lalabel's time slot was the non-magical-girl series Hello! Sandybell, which featured many of the same staff. In the meantime, other studios, particularly Studio Pierrot, would assume the magical girl mantle that Toei had abandoned. Story Lalabel is a magical girl who has a magic wand and a magic case full of magic items. She owns a kitten as a pet. She lives happily in the magic world, until the day she sees the thief Biscus stealing all the magic tools. Startled by her sudden appearance, Biscus swings his magic wand around with dismay. They fall into the human world under the influence of the wand's magic power. While unconscious, Lalabel is found by an elderly couple, the Tachibanas. They take her home, and upon finding out that she is an orphan, decide to let her stay with them. Lalabel decides to stay until she can capture Biscus. She attends school with Teko, the granddaughter of the Tachibanas, and Toko. She slowly develops a sense of humour and pathos, and finds herself falling in love. Whenever she sees Biscus performing his bad deeds, she has to stop him. Finally Lalabel writes proverbs related to the events of the day in her diary. Living in the human world, Lalabel discovers fascinating aspects of human beings and finds herself happy there. In the last episode, after the last battle between Lalabel and Biscus, both magic cases are emptied of magic items and vanish, rendering both of them completely human. The villains reform and promise not to bother Lalabel or any of her friends anymore. Lalabel, Teko and Toko move on up to play. Characters *Lalabel The main character. She is a magical girl from the magic world. One night, while she is sleeping, her magical items wake her up, and she sees Biscus stealing two magical briefcases. After being pulled to Earth by Biscus, she is adopted by the Tachibanas, and decides to stay until she can capture Biscus and return home. Being from the magical world, she is very naive about Earth customs. Her wand was made into a real life toy, the first case of magical girl merchandise. *Biscus A very fat thief of and the main antagonist. He stole two magical briefcases from the magical realm Lalabel lived in, but after being surprised by Lalabel, he transports the two of them to Earth, losing one of the briefcases in the process. While on Earth, he shacks up with a ramen stand owner, Hokiba, who is as greedy and nasty as himself. He tries to swindle people with his (stolen) magic powers while trying to steal Lalabel's briefcase. He has a grey cat as nasty and horrid as himself. *The Tachibanas The kind old couple who let Lalabel stay with them. Mrs Tachibana is the typical kindly grandmother figure, and made Lalabel's signature pink dress. Mr Tachibana is cynical and does not like magic. After Lalabel saves him from drowning, he starts to warm up to her and her magic. He is the one who comes up with the proverbs Lalabel writes. *Teko The granddaughter of the Tachibanas and a friend of Lalabel. She wears glasses and pigtails. She lives with her grandparents due to her parents working overseas. *Toko Friend to Lalabel and Teko. Sometimes she's mistaken as a boy because of her masculine outfits. Together she and Teko form the typical \\"tomboy and girly-girl\\" duo seen in many early magical-girl series. *Hokiba Biscus' sidekick. Very often involved in Biscus' swindling schemes and runs a ramen stand. He is characterized by a leaf attached to his cowlick. *Tsubomi The rich girl in Lalabel, Teko, and Toko's class. She has a snobbish attitude towards Teko and Toko and uses her privilege to get her way. Lalabel saved her from being hit by her father's construction vehicles that were ignoring a sidewalk Lalabel and friends use to get to school, just so he could speedily finish a major project in town.

Hales was the eldest son of Sir Thomas Hales, 2nd Baronet, of Brymore, and his wife Mary Pym, daughter of Sir Charles Pym, 1st Baronet of Brymore. He matriculated at Oriel College, Oxford in 1711 and was admitted at the Inner Temple. He succeeded his father as 3rd Baronet on 7 January 1748. Hales entered Parliament at the 1722 British general election as Whig Member of Parliament for Minehead, being a member of the Duke of Dorset's faction and supporting the Walpole and Pelham governments. He subsequently also represented Camelford, Grampound, Hythe and East Grinstead, being an MP for most of the last forty years of his life. The only break in his Parliamentary career came in 1741: at the notoriously corrupt rotten borough of Grampound, his opponents had contrived a disagreement over who was the rightful Mayor and therefore returning officer for the constituency. According to their Mayor, Hales and his pro-government colleague Thomas Trefusis were re-elected by 35 votes to 17; however, his opponents had arranged for the Sheriff to direct the writ for the election to their own nominee, so it was his version of the result (declaring Hales and Trefusis defeated by 27 to 23) which was returned to Parliament. Hales and Trefusis initially petitioned against this outcome, but withdrew their protest before a decision had been reached. Hales returned to the Commons at a by-election for Hythe three years later. Hales held the lucrative post of Clerk of the Board of Green Cloth to the Prince of Wales from about 1719 until 1727, and to the King from his accession in 1727 until 1760. He was also Lieutenant of Dover Castle from 1728 to 1750 and Vice-Warden of the Cinque Ports from 1750 until his death. On the accession of George III in 1760 he lost his posts in the Royal Household, and successfully applied to Prime Minister Newcastle for a pension in recompense, although he was granted only ¬£600 a year in place of the ¬£800 he had asked for. Hales died in 1762. He had married Mary Marsham (1698‚Äì1769), daughter of Sir Robert Marsham of the Mote, in 1723, and their children included: * Sir Thomas Pym Hales (c. 1726‚Äì1773), who succeeded to the baronetcy * Sir Philip Hales (died 1824) * Mary Hales, who married Charles Moss (1711‚Äì1802), Bishop of Bath and Wells * Anne Hales (1736‚Äì1795), who married (first) Lord Feversham (died 1763) and (second) The Earl of Radnor (1725‚Äì1776) * Margaretta Hales, who married Samuel Pechell of Richmond References * Hales genealogy *Robert Beatson, A Chronological Register of Both Houses of Parliament (London: Longman, Hurst, Res & Orme, 1807) * Lewis Namier, The Structure of Politics at the Accession of George III (2nd edition ‚Äì London: St Martin's Press, 1961) * Lewis Namier & John Brooke, The History of Parliament: The House of Commons 1754‚Äì1790 (London: HMSO, 1964) *Henry Stooks Smith, \\"The Parliaments of England from 1715 to 1847\\" (2nd edition, edited by FWS Craig ‚Äì Chichester: Parliamentary Reference Publications, 1973) - 1762 deaths Alumni of Oriel College, Oxford Members of the Inner Temple Baronets in the Baronetage of England Members of the Parliament of Great Britain for English constituencies Whig (British political party) MPs Year of birth uncertain Members of the Parliament of Great Britain for constituencies in Cornwall British MPs 1722‚Äì1727 British MPs 1727‚Äì1734 British MPs 1734‚Äì1741 British MPs 1741‚Äì1747 British MPs 1747‚Äì1754 British MPs 1754‚Äì1761 British MPs 1761‚Äì1768 ","title":"Sir Thomas Hales, 3rd Baronet"},{"id":"12854668","text":"Alstonia marquisensis is a species of plant in the family Apocynaceae.

The leaves are considered to be highly toxic to humans and should not be consumed under any circumstances. Alternanthera helleri is a fall-blooming species, it can be planted at any time of year, but the best time is early/middle fall, as this provides it with an optimum blooming window when it will be in season. It is very rare to find growing in the wild, and recent national park's and forest's efforts to remove hazardous plants such as this one have drastically reduced the numbers in the wild. It is still grown, however, in laboratory settings, where scientists try to analyze just exactly what makes it so toxic to humans.

Biography =Early life and education= Luis Fernando was born at Madrid, the younger son of Infante Antonio, Duke of Galliera and of his wife, Infanta Eulalia of Spain. He was baptised with the names Luis Fernando Mar√≠a Zacar√≠as; the name Zacar√≠as is in honour of Saint Zechariah on whose feast day Luis Fernando was born. In 1899 Luis Fernando and his older brother Alfonso were sent to England to be educated by the Jesuits at Beaumont College.Bernardo Rodr√≠guez Caparrini, \\"A Catholic Public School in the Making\\", Paedagogica Historica 39 (December 2003): 743. They remained there until 1904. Elisabeth de Gramont, Duchess of Clermont-Tonnerre, who chronicled various aspects of Parisian life in her four-volume memoirs, wrote about him: \\"The Infante was certainly the most divertingly cynical little creature who ever amused Paris. Slim, pallid, round- and restless-eyed like a bird, sullen looking, with lovely hands like those of a Co√´llo Infanta, he promenaded his lubricous little royal person from drawing-room to awful bouges and then, ingratiatingly and affectionately, he would sink like an abandoned child at the feet of some 'Good Dame' and lament his lot.\\"Elisabeth de Gramont, Years of Plenty, translated by Florence and Victor Llona, New York: Jonathan Cape and Harrison Smith, 1931, p. 114. =Marriage rumors and exile= On July 17, 1914, The New York Times reported the marriage of Luis Fernando to Beatrice Harrington.\\"Prince Weds a Commoner\\", The New York Times (July 17, 1914): 4.

He was purportedly involved in the trade of illegal drugs. In response King Alfonso XIII of Spain deprived him of his privileges as an Infante of Spain. Unable to reside either in Spain or France, Luis Fernando moved to Lisbon. In March 1926 he was arrested at the Portuguese-Spanish border disguised as a woman.\\"Seize Spanish Prince Disguised as Woman\\", The New York Times (March 26, 1926): 6.

On September 19, 1930, Luis Fernando and Marie married in a civil ceremony in a London registry office. On October 4, 1930, they were married in a religious ceremony in the Cathedral of San Siro in Sanremo on the Italian Riviera.\\"Royal Couple Wed Again\\", The New York Times (October 5, 1930): 29.

She was responsible for delivering troops, goods and equipment to locations in the war zone. Built in New Orleans, Louisiana Syrma (AK-134), ex-SS Andres Almonaster (MC hull 2455), was laid down on 10 January 1944 by the Delta Shipbuilding Co., New Orleans, Louisiana; launched on 19 February 1944; sponsored by Mrs. James L. Wallace; acquired by the Navy on 20 March 1944; and commissioned on 21 March 1944.  World War II operations  Syrma was acquired from the War Shipping Administration on a bareboat charter and converted to naval use as an auxiliary cargo ship by the Todd-Galveston Drydock Co., Galveston, Texas, from 27 March to 12 August 1944. She sailed for Norfolk, Virginia, the next day and arrived there on the 20th to begin her shakedown cruise. She was in the yard from 26 to 31 August for a short availability period and sailed with a convoy on 3 September. Her orders were modified five days later to proceed independently to Gulfport, Mississippi. Syrma loaded cargo there from 10 to 14 September and moved to New Orleans to complete loading. = Pacific Theatre operations = Syrma, moved to Mobile, Alabama, where she took AFD-29 in tow and sailed for Panama on the 23d. She arrived at the Panama Canal Zone on 30 September; remained there until 9 October; and continued on to Hawaii. She arrived at Pearl Harbor on 31 October and remained in the islands until 25 November when she got underway for San Francisco, California. The cargo ship arrived there on 4 December 1944 and got underway for Portland, Oregon, the same day. Syrma remained there until 28 January 1945 when she departed for San Francisco. She loaded cargo from 1 to 9 February and sailed for Manus Island on the 10th with YF-619 in tow. = Supporting troops on Tarawa = Syrma arrived at Seeadler Harbor on 7 March; unloaded her cargo and tow; and began the return voyage to San Francisco on the 23d. She arrived on 13 April and remained there until 8 June when she sailed for Hawaii with YF-738 in tow. She arrived at Pearl Harbor on 18 May, released the tow, and sailed the next day for Tarawa, Gilbert Islands. Tarawa was reached on the 28th. The ship unloaded her cargo and took on deck cargo for the Marshall Islands and left the next day. = End-of-war operations = Syrma operated in the Marshalls from 1 July to 12 August when she stood out for San Francisco, arriving there on the 26th. On 28 September, the ship again headed westward en route to Guam. She arrived at Apra Harbor on 18 October and departed Guam on 10 November for the east coast of the United States. The Panama Canal was transited on 9 December, and Syrma arrived at Norfolk on the 20th.  Post-war decommissioning  The remainder of December 1945 was spent in preparing the ship for inactivation. Syrma was decommissioned on 8 January 1946, returned to the War Shipping Administration on the 11th, and struck from the Navy List on 21 January 1946.

Its last assignment was with United States Air Forces in Europe, assigned to Seventeenth Air Force, being stationed at Lindsey Air Station, Germany. It was inactivated on 30 June 1991. History Established as the 4 Air Defense Wing, the unit was not activated or manned. Redesignated as the 65th Fighter Wing, the wing and its subordinate units transferred to England and was assigned to VIII Fighter Command in June 1943 and began flying combat missions. \\"Subordinate units escorted bombers, flew counter air patrols, and dive bombing missions. They attacked airdromes, marshaling yards, missile sites, industrial areas, ordnance depots, oil refineries, trains, and highways. During Big Week [in late] February 1944, the 65th participated in the assaults against the German Air Force and the German aircraft industry. Its units supported the Allied invasion of Normandy (June 1944); the Allied ground troops during the Battle of the Bulge (December 1944 through January 1945); the Allied airborne attack on the Netherlands (Operation Market Garden, September 1944); the defense of the Remagen bridgehead against German air attacks (March 1945); and the airborne attack across the Rhine (March 1945).\\" \\"As an Air Division, it carried out air defense operations in Iceland from 1952 to 1954. Activated three years later it transferred to Spain, where it cooperated with Spanish Air Force units in the Air Defense Direction Centers (ADDCs). The 65th Air Division directed base construction, and the establishment of off base housing and radar sites. Its fighter squadrons flew air defense interceptions over Spanish airspace.\\" The air division \\"also controlled the operations of attached tactical fighter squadrons deployed to Spain for temporary duty. Assigned or attached units of the division participated in numerous exercises with the Spanish Air Defense Command, and in some instances, with the United States Sixth Fleet. In June 1985, the 65th assumed responsibility for integrating the United States Air Forces in Europe's electronic combat systems to maximize overall warfighting potential.\\" In this role, it supervised the 66th Electronic Combat Wing and 601st Tactical Control Wing. The division was inactivated in June 1991 as the Air Force eliminated air divisions to shorten the chain of command.

It is to be greatly extended to according to the master plan. Thailand's motorway network is considered to be separate from Thailand's expressway network, which is the system of expressways, usually elevated, within Greater Bangkok. Thailand also has a provincial highway network. Motorway 7 Free Section Motorway 7 Toll Section Motorway 9 Toll Section Overview The Thai highway network spans over 70,000 kilometers across all regions of Thailand. These highways, however, are often dual carriageways with frequent U-turn lanes and intersections, thus slowing down traffic. Coupled with the increase in the number of vehicles and the demand for limited-access motorways, the Thai Government issued a cabinet resolution in 1997 detailing the motorway construction master plan. Some upgraded sections of highway are being turned into \\"motorways\\", while other motorways are being purpose-built. Routes =Motorway 7= Motorway 7 stretches from Rama IX Road in Bangkok, passes Motorway Route 9 (Kanchanaphisek Road), Suvarnabhumi Airport towards Pattaya, nearly . It exists separately in two sections. The toll section has eight exits, namely Rom Klao, Lat Krabang, Bang Kwai, Bang Bo, Bang Pakong, Phan Thong, Chonburi, and Bang Phra. There is also a rest station and highway police center at kilometre 50. The free section of this route (former highway Route 36) towards Pattaya is completed. There are also highway widening projects aimed at increasing the capacity of this route to eight lanes. Currently, sections of this route from Srinagarindra Road to Chonburi are eight lanes wide. =Motorway 9= Motorway 9 also known as the Outer Ring Road or Kanchanaphisek Road is a limited-access motorway that links the outer fringes of Greater Bangkok. The eastern and southern route is a toll section, which extends from Bang Pa-In through Lam Lukka, Ram Inthra, and meets motorway Route 7 at Thap Chang interchange. The southern section of this motorway was completed in November 2007 which joined Bang Na-Trat Highway (Route 34) and Rama II Highway (Route 35). A project to widen the currently four-lane motorway to eight lanes is in progress. Thailand now has two operational motorways. The western route is a free section, which extends from RamaII Road (Route 35) at Bang Khun Thien through Bang Khae, Chim Phli, Bang Yai, Bang Bua Thong, Pathum Thani, Sam Khok and meets Phahon Yothin highway (Route 1) at Bang Pa-In1 interchange. Motorway master plan =Motorway 5= Motorway Route 5 designates motorways heading north, which are the equivalent of Highway Route 1. According to the Intercity Motorways Office, Route 5 will stretch towards Chiang Rai passing through Nakhon Sawan, Phitsanulok, and Lampang. There are plans to convert sections of an existing highway into this motorway route, but construction plans are still vague. =Motorway 6= Motorway Route 6 designates motorways heading northeast, which is the equivalent of Highway Route 2. This route is supposed to stretch from the Outer Ring Road or motorway Route 9 towards Nong Khai totalling a distance of . This route is to pass Nakhon Ratchasima, Khon Kaen, and Udon Thani before reaching Nong Khai. Realistically, however, the section between the Outer Ring Road and Nakhon Ratchasima is under construction. =Motorway 7= Motorway Route 7 designates motorways heading east, which is the equivalent of sections of Highway Route 3. This motorway has been recently extended by about to reach Pattaya and the master plan indicates a desire to extend the route to Chantaburi via Rayong, from Bangkok. =Motorway 8= Motorway 8 designates motorways heading south, which is the equivalent of sections of Highway Route 3 and Highway Route 4. The master plan indicates that this route is to be extended from the Outer Ring Road towards Songkhla. It is also the longest route, totalling . Currently, due to heavy congestion on main highway towards the south, the plan to build a section of this motorway from the Outer Ring Road towards Cha-am in Phetchaburi Province is steadily moving forward. =Motorway 81= Motorway 81 designates motorways heading west, which is the equivalent of sections of Highway Route 4 and Highway Route 323. The master plan indicates that this route is supposed to stretch from the Outer Ring Road towards Kanchanaburi. Totalling a distance and now under construction.

Although the wave initially experienced strong easterly wind shear, it quickly moved into an environment better suited for tropical development and gained organization. On the morning of August 13, the National Hurricane Center recognized the system's organization and designated it Tropical Depression Four while it was still more than 1,500 mi (2,400 km) east of the Lesser Antilles. A deep layered ridge to its north steered the system west as it moved rapidly towards the Caribbean and into warmer waters. On August 14 the depression gained strength and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Dean. By August 16, the storm had intensified further and attained hurricane status. Hurricane Dean continued to intensify as it tracked westward through the Lesser Antilles. Once in the Caribbean Sea, the storm rapidly intensified to a Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. Weakening slightly, it brushed the southern coast of Jamaica on August 19 as a Category 4 hurricane and continued towards the Yucat√°n Peninsula through even warmer waters. The favorable conditions of the western Caribbean Sea allowed the storm to intensify and it regained Category 5 status the next day before making landfall in southern Quintana Roo. Hurricane Dean was one of two storms in the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season to make landfall as a Category 5 hurricane and was the seventh most intense Atlantic hurricane ever recorded, tied with Camille and Mitch. After its first landfall, Hurricane Dean crossed the Yucat√°n Peninsula and emerged, weakened, into the Bay of Campeche. It briefly restrengthened in the warm waters of the bay before making a second landfall in Veracruz. Dean progressed to the northwest, weakening into a remnant low which finally dissipated over the southwestern United States. Formation UTC on August 12, 2007 On August 11, 2007, a vigorous tropical wave moved off the west coast of Africa, producing disorganized showers and thunderstorms. It encountered conditions favorable for gradual development, and on August 12 it gained organization and became a low. Strong upper-level easterly winds slowed development, but on August 13 the tropical wave gained enough organization that the National Hurricane Center designated it Tropical Depression Four. At this time it was centered about 520 mi (835 km) west-southwest of Cape Verde. The depression was already exhibiting persistent deep convection in the western portion of its circulation. It moved quickly westward, south of a deep layered ridge, escaping the easterly wind shear that had been slowing its development and moving over warmer waters. At 1500 UTC on August 14, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Dean while still 1450 mi (2300 km) east of Barbados. Even as its convection waned slightly that afternoon, its intensity grew, and convection flared in the center that night. Dry air and cooler air inflow from the north slowed structural development; nevertheless, ragged bands began to form on August 15. By mid-morning, a rough banding eye had formed, and by the next morning a full eye developed. The storm was upgraded to Hurricane Dean at 0900 UTC August 16, 550 mi (890 km) east of Barbados. A strong ridge of high pressure continued to push the system west, towards the Caribbean Sea. That afternoon, convective banding and increasing upper-level outflow strengthened the storm to a Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. The eye disappeared briefly overnight, possibly as part of a diurnal fluctuation, but returned by the morning of August 17. Caribbean Sea and first landfall At 0930 UTC on August 17, the center of Hurricane Dean passed into the Caribbean Sea through the Saint Lucia Channel between the islands of Martinique and St. Lucia. The northern eyewall passed over Martinique where a weather station in the island's capital of Fort-de-France reported 13 in (33 cm) of rainfall. By this time the eyewall had closed, forming a distinct eye, and in an environment of low wind shear and increasing ocean temperature the hurricane began to intensify rapidly. Hurricane Dean strengthened to a Category 3 hurricane by the evening of August 17. Satellite imagery showed that a well defined eye and numerous cyclonically curved convective bands remained over the Lesser Antilles. That evening, another reconnaissance aircraft reached the hurricane and discovered that it had strengthened into a Category 4 hurricane, and by 0600 UTC on August 18, Dean reached Category 5 intensity for the first time with 165 mph (270 km/h) winds. The storm's wind radii increased in all quadrants as the storm grew in both intensity and size. At 0800 UTC August 18, Hurricane Dean passed directly over NOAA sea buoy 42059 which reported a significant wave height (average size of the largest 33% of waves) of 33 ft (10 m). On August 18, Hurricane Dean developed a double eyewall, indicating that an eyewall replacement cycle was taking place and causing short term fluctuations in intensity as Dean weakened back to a Category 4 hurricane. That afternoon the hurricane continued to improve its outflow, and its numerous spiral bands gave it a well defined satellite presentation. Hurricane Dean finished the eyewall replacement cycle early on August 19 with some trochoidal wobbles. Category 4 storm on August 20 at approximately 1841 UTC, 14 hours before landfall On the morning of August 19, the storm remained slightly weakened from its peak strength. As a Category 4 hurricane with wind speeds between 140 mph (220 km/h) and 145 mph (230 km/h), the center of Hurricane Dean passed 90 mi (150 km) south of Haiti, and that evening passed 25 mi (40 km) south of Jamaica. Two weather stations on the island of Jamaica, one at Ingleside and the other at Morant Bay, both reported in excess of 13 in (33 cm) of rainfall. In contrast, the weather station at Les Cayes, Haiti recorded only 1.18 in (3 cm) of rainfall. Hurricane Dean intensified through the night of August 19 and reinforced its completed eyewall replacement cycle by forming a tight single-walled eye. At 0100 UTC August 20, the storm passed 120 mi (190 km) to the south of Sea Buoy 42056, which recorded a significant wave height of 36 ft (11 m). A concentric eyewall was briefly observed again on the morning of August 20, but it did not last long. In conditions of low wind shear, Hurricane Dean moved westward over waters with increasingly high heat content, and the storm exhibited a classic upper-tropospheric outflow pattern. The high pressure system over the southeastern United States continued to steer the storm west towards the Yucat√°n Peninsula. The eyewall became even better defined throughout the day. The cloud tops cooled, the minimum central pressure fell, and its winds increased to 160 mph (260 km/h), making Hurricane Dean a Category 5 hurricane once again. This time, it was less than 210 mi (335 km) from its first landfall. Although many of the convective bands were already located over the Yucat√°n Peninsula, Hurricane Dean continued to intensify until the eye made landfall. As the eye moved over Mexico near the town of Majahual in the Costa Maya area, the NHC estimated surface level winds of 175 mph (280 km/h), making Dean the first storm to make landfall as a Category 5 hurricane in the Atlantic basin since Hurricane Andrew in 1992. At the same time, a dropsonde reading from the hurricane's eye estimated a central pressure of 905 mbar, making Dean the third most intense landfalling Atlantic storm in history (after the Labor Day Hurricane of 1935 and Hurricane Gilbert of 1988) and tying Dean with Camille and Mitch as the seventh most intense hurricane ever recorded in the Atlantic basin. The landfall itself occurred in a sparsely populated area of the Costa Maya region of the Mexican state of Quintana Roo near 18.7 N 87.8 W at 0900 UTC August 21 and brought with it a storm surge of 12‚Äì18 ft (3.7‚Äì5.5 m). A weather station at Chetumal (the capital of Quintana Roo, Mexico) reported 6.65 in (17 cm) of rainfall during Hurricane Dean's landfall. As expected, the landfall caused significant weakening of the storm; the eye filled and the cold cloud-tops warmed. The land severely disrupted the storm's organization, and by the time Dean crossed the Yucat√°n Peninsula it had weakened to a Category 1 hurricane. Gulf of Mexico and demise Hurricane Dean emerged into the Bay of Campeche as a Category 1 hurricane on the afternoon of August 21. Its inner core was largely disrupted, so although a ragged eye reformed over the warm waters of the bay, the hurricane no longer had the structure to support its previous strength. Nevertheless, the warm waters of the bay proved conducive for some development and the eye contracted overnight, indicating that the hurricane was regaining structure. With better structure came stronger winds of 100 mph (160 km/h), and the storm was re-categorized as a Category 2 hurricane. The storm's strengthening pattern continued until Hurricane Dean made its second and final landfall at 1630 UTC August 22 near Tecolutla, Veracruz, just east of Guti√©rrez Zamora and about 40 mi (65 km) south-southeast of Tuxpan. A weather station at Requetemu, San Luis Potos√≠, recorded 15.4 in (39 cm) of rainfall during the storm's second landfall. Dean weakened rapidly, losing its low level circulation within hours and its mid-level circulation the next day as it encountered the Sierra Madre Oriental mountain range. Its remnants passed over the mountains and into the eastern Pacific Ocean as a broad area of low pressure. Hurricane Dean's remnant low pressure system then drifted north into southern California, bringing thunderstorms to northern San Diego County, and more than 2 in (5 cm) of rain to Lake Wohlford. In Escondido almost 2 in (5 cm) of rain fell in 90 minutes. The remnant low pressure system weakened over western Arizona and southern California before finally dissipating on August 30.

It is used medicinally and in lacquers. The wood is often used for torches and firewood. Its high resin content causes it to burn brightly, and it will burn well even when green. In addition, the wood is hard, heavy, close-grained, can take a high polish, and repels dry wood termites. Essential oils containing caryophyllene, cadinene, and cadinol are extracted from A. balsamifera and A. elemifera. These are used in varnishes, perfumes, medicines, cosmetics, soaps, and incense.

The historical development of sub- vertebrate or non-vertebrate paleozoology may also be described as the history of invertebrate paleobiology or as the history of invertebrate paleontology. Nearly synonymous are the history of marine paleozoology, history of marine paleobiology, and history of marine paleontology ‚Äì although the latter three may cover prehistoric fishes, sharks and simpler sea-dwelling organisms. By far, invertebrate paleozoology is the easiest type of fossil collecting. Unlike the difficult-to-analyze and hard-to-interpret fossils of paleobotany (plants) and micropaleontology (microbes), and unlike the rarely found and poorly preserved skeletons of vertebrate paleontology, invertebrate fossils are usually both common and simple to identify. This is because many prehistoric invertebrates were hard-shelled mollusks, brachiopods, trilobites, bryozoans, crinoids or corals who were buried amid marine, sediment-preserving conditions; and therefore frequently fossilized. Origins of invertebrate paleozoology Stone-Age people were without doubt the very first fossil collectors. Fossilized echinoderms have been found in Dunstable, Bedfordshire, central England, decorating a long-buried human skeleton; the prehistoric gravesite was Neolithic. In widely separated, ancient societies around the globe, there once were many legends and tales of great floods, sea serpents, dragons, sea monsters, and invertebrate cryptozoa associated with so-called formed stones or figured stones of sea shells, fishes, corals, sea lilies, tracks, burrows, and trails. But, as civilizations progressed, these odd rocks began to be recognized as the fossilized remains and traces of prehistoric animals. Scholars in ancient Greece produced some of the first scientific insights. Preceding Charles Darwin by two thousand years, Anaximander of Miletus (611 to 547 BCE) proposed a non-creationist, evolutionary theory of life. After Xenophanes of Colophon (576 to 480 BCE) scrutinized fossils of mollusks and other sea-dwelling creatures entombed in rock strata, Xenophanes pronounced that these fossils were evidence of once-living animals. Similarly, after examining fossil sea shells around 440 BCE, Empedocles of Akragas hypothesized that natural selection was occurring over vast, incomprehensible expanses of time. By the middle of the 4th century BCE, Aristotle was composing On the Origins of Animals. Both he and his follower/successor Theophrastus speculated that plastic forces within the earth had turned animals into fossils of stone. In the medieval Islamic world, Avicenna (979 to 1039 CE), in his The Book of Healing (1027), offered an explanation of how the stoniness of fossils was caused. Aristotle previously explained it in terms of vaporous exhalations, which Avicenna modified into the theory of petrifying fluids (succus lapidificatus), which was elaborated on by Albert of Saxony in the 14th century and accepted in some form by most naturalists by the 16th century. Paleozoology was an area of interest in the European Renaissance of scientific inquiry. Significantly, Georgius Agricola - a founder of mineralology - discussed and illustrated invertebrate fossils in his De Natura Fossilium (1546 / 1558). Although remembered mostly for his development of binomial nomenclature and biotic systematics in his Systema Naturae (1735), Carl Linnaeus also described many prehistoric marine invertebrates which he had observed within Silurian strata in his native Sweden. And while Jean- √âtienne Guettard (1715 to 1786) discussed the marine paleoecology of ancient mollusks, more and more fossils were being reported from the Americas and Australasia. Georges L. L. Buffon subsequently described seven geologic Epochs of Nature (1778) wherein he boldly argued that fossiliferous sedimentary strata proved that the world was at least 70,000 years old. In 1795 the very first geochronologic period ‚Äì the Jurassic ‚Äì was named. 19th-century developments A plate from William Smith's 1815 work Strata by Organized Fossils Soon thereafter, Buffon's colleague Chevalier de Lamarck ‚Äì a founder of invertebrate systematics and invertebrate paleontology ‚Äì published still- more shell fossils in his Systematics of Animals Without Backbones, (1801) and his Natural History of Animals Without Backbones (1815 to 1822), so as to illustrate global changes in paleogeography. Lamarck also argued that the more adaptable prehistoric invertebrates were the animals that survived environmental change ‚Äì a prelude to the concept of survival of the fittest. Next, William Smith employed invertebrate index fossils to map British outcrops in his Geological Map of England and Wales with Part of Scotland (1815), and in his book the very next year, Strata Identified by Organized Fossils (1816).For Smith's founding of English geology, read Simon Winchester (2001), The Map that Changed the World (London, England: Harper Collins and the Geological Society of London). Trilobite fossil Sir Roderick Impey Murchison and Charles Lapworth quarried middle Paleozoic era index fossils, such as the extinct trilobites, extinct graptolites, and mostly extinct brachiopods. Their efforts led to the latter's ground-breaking treatise, The Silurian System (1839), and to the naming of the Ordovician, Silurian, Devonian and Permian geologic periods. Eclipsing Maurchison's inventory of Silurian fossils, however, was Adam Sedgwick's 1835 discovery of even-older Cambrian period fossils. Three years later, Sedgwick proposed that its stratigraphic era be named the Paleozoic. Meanwhile, yet another Briton, Sir Charles Lyell, penned his Principles of Geology (1830) and Elements of Geology (1838) in which he divided the Tertiary into the epochs of Eocene, Miocene, Oligocene and Pliocene. By 1834 to 1838, naturalists from France to Russia were using the term \\"paleontology\\", and adding yet other names to its prehistoric eons, eras, periods, epochs, and ages. Crinoid fossil The provocative Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation (1844 to 1853) by then-anonymous Robert Chambers, Alfred Russel Wallace's joint essay (1858) with Charles Darwin, and Darwin's Origin of Species (1859 to 1872) popularized the evolutionary theories of natural selection. Indeed, in the very first edition of his Origin of Species (1859), Darwin even speculated that the earth might be half a billion years old. Scientific critics, however, pressured him to withdraw this notion from all subsequent editions. In this book Darwin also expressed frustration at the seemingly total absence of Pre-Cambrian creatures prior to the Cambrian explosion of the invertebrates, since many critics saw this absence as proof of creationism. Around the same time, James Hall produced his comprehensive, many volumes of Paleontology of New York State (1847 to 1894), based on his years of collecting trilobites, graptolites, brachiopods, crinoids, echinoids, mollusks and other ancient marine invertebrates. Inspired by Darwin's manifesto, Thomas Henry Huxley emphatically cited embryologic and fossil evidence for the evolution of \\"higher\\" invertebrates from \\"lower\\" cnidarians, worms and mollusks, thereby elaborating what he concluded was Man's Place in Nature (1863). Another Darwinist, Ernst Haeckel, proposed a Protozoa-Metazoa theory of animal origins, while arguing that embryonic \\"ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny\\" throughout organic prehistory. Haeckel popularized his paleozoologic ideas with majestic genealogical trees of the Animal Kingdom in his General Morphology of Organisms (1866). A half-century later, the genetic conclusions of Gregor Mendel (1822 to 1884) were revived by The Mutation Theory propounded by Hugo de Vries, thereby fortifying Darwin's 19th-century theory of evolution.For more about de Vries and Mendelism, see Theodosius Dobzhansky (1951), Genetics and the Origin of Species. . 20th-century developments Around the same time, paleozoologist Charles Doolittle Walcott proved trilobites to be arthropods ‚Äì and not at all like mollusks. Then, in 1910, he discovered the best-preserved Cambrian fossils ever found: the Burgess shale fauna. Over the next seven years, Walcott excavated 80,000 fossils from the fossiliferous site.For some provocative illustrations of Walcott's fossils, and an interesting critique of his discovery, read Stephen Jay Gould (1989), Wonderful Life: The Burgess Shale and the Nature of History (New York: W. W. Norton). Meanwhile, in The Origin of Continents and Oceans (1915 / 1929), Alfred Wegener outlined his heretical theory of continental drift. Although he cited invertebrate fossils and continental geography in support of his idea, another half-century would pass before Wegener's theory would be vindicated by findings in geophysics and plate tectonics. By that time, 20th-century sciences ‚Äì such as biometrics, organic chemistry, electron microscopy and molecular phylogenetics ‚Äì were aiding invertebrate paleobiologists as they searched for evidence even in the rugged, barren lands of Saharan Africa, Sinkiang, the Mongolian Plateau, and Antarctica. In 1947, paleontologist Reg Sprigg discovered the Ediacaran fauna ‚Äì the best-preserved fossil invertebrates of the billion-year-long Proterozoic eon. Darwin's 1859 embarrassment at the absence of Pre-Cambrian fossils was now put at rest.

Retrieved 8/20/07. Background In a report on the Indian Congress published in the American Anthropologist in 1899, its chief ethnological consultant, James Mooney credited the realization of the project to \\"the grit and determination of the exposition managers, foremost among whom was Edward Rosewater, proprietor of the Omaha Bee. The successful outcome was due chiefly to his tireless activity and unfaltering courage. The ethnologic project was the child of his brain, and in spite of serious imperfections, the general result was such‚Äîparticularly from the practical standpoint of the ticket seller‚Äîthat we may expect to see ethnology a principal feature at future expositions so long as our aboriginal material holds out.\\" After steady lobbying by Rosewater, an extremely influential Republican and a friend of President William McKinley, and other members of the organizing committee of the Trans-Mississippi International Exposition, in December 1897 a bill was introduced in the United States Congress that provided an appropriation of $100,000 to carry out an Indian Congress at the same time as the Expo. After it passed in the Senate, preparations for the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War monopolized the United States House of Representatives, preventing a vote on the bill. In July 1898, $40,000 was made available for the event in the Indian Appropriations Act by the President. That was a month after the rest of the Expo opened. Funding was also made available by the Bureau of American Ethnology, a part of the Smithsonian Institution.\\"Westward the Empire: Omaha's world fair of 1898\\", University of Nebraska at Omaha Television. Retrieved 8/20/07. In 1898 W. A. Jones, the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, sent a letter to each Indian Agency to appeal for attendees. The purpose of the Indian Congress, as he stated, was: About Ponca Tribe encampment. The entire Indian Congress was managed by ethnologist James Mooney and Army Captain William Mercer of the 8th U. S. Infantry, under the direction of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs acting on behalf of Cornelius Newton Bliss, the United States Secretary of the Interior. The original intention of the organizing committee was to illustrate the daily life, industry and traits of as many tribes as possible. However, once the congress was open authorities realized that the average person attending the Exposition wanted to see dances, games, races, ceremonials and sham battles. Soon the main activities of the Indian Congress were re-enactments and the Ghost Dance.\\"Indian Congress Activities.\\" Omaha Public Library. Retrieved 8/20/07. =Weather= According to Captain Mercer's report, the weather \\"has been trying in the extreme ... Most of the time we have had extreme heat accompanied by dry, hot winds, which rendered camp life anything but pleasant, the conditions being rendered somewhat worse by our location. Following close upon the heated period we have just had a week of cold, heavy rains which made the camp and life in it more disagreeable even than it was during the hot spell.\\" =Criticism= Ethnologist Mooney sought for the Congress to display customs of the various tribes. Instead, promoters erected a 5,000 seat grandstand, and arranged the tribes in re-enactments of battles.Mooney, J. (1899) \\"The Indian Congress at Omaha,\\" American Anthropologist - New Series. 1(1) pp. 126-149. There were also concerns regarding the Indian Congress hosting a Ghost Dance, particularly after the U.S. Army attacked dancers during the Wounded Knee Massacre in 1890. However, the Ghost Dance was encouraged by the managers of the Exposition. A local newspaper reported the Ghost Dance became a popular attraction. The Ghost Dance shirt of Big Foot was displayed in another part of the Expo. =Frank A. Rinehart= Mooney contracted with Frank A. Rinehart and Adolph Muhr to take photographs of the attendees. Rinehart made several hundred pictures, regarded as one of the most complete, non-exotifying collections of Native American portraits in existence. Rinehart and Muhr took their photographs in a studio on Expo grounds.U.S. Department of Interior Museum online gallery of the 1898 Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition. Speaking of his photos of the Indian Congress, Merry Foresta, director of the Smithsonian Photography Initiative at the Smithsonian Institution said, \\"Rinehart's portraits are really quite extraordinary and put him above the average workaday photographer who might have also made photographs for similar reasons. There were other people working, but he seems to have really, because of the quality of his work, stood apart.\\"Paget, M.

Mooney's above-quoted observation that ethnology would be \\"a principal feature at future expositions\\" proved prophetic, for Indian Congresses were also convened at the Pan-American Exposition in 1901 and the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in 1904.

They are present in low and mountain cloud forest in Caribbean islands, Central America, and northern to central South America.  Description  They are shrubs or trees up to 25 m high, hermaphrodites. The leaves are alternate, entire, and elliptical or narrowly elliptical. The inflorescences are paniculate and axillary, the flowers are arranged in cymes essentially, and those strictly opposite side are small. The fruit is a berry- like drupe dispersed mostly by birds. Fruits are 3 cm long and 1.5 cm wide, with deep domes, and warty. Many species have a valuable timber in yellow wood, others have the wood and bark pleasantly scented. The oils extracted from certain species are used as ingredients in the manufacture of perfumes. Ecology Aniba is a genus of great ecological importance. It currently includes 41 species, classified into six different subgroups, in which the woody structures are almost undifferentiated; the differences are ecological adaptations to different environments over a relatively dry-wet climate. Species in less humid environments are smaller or less robust, with less abundant and thinner foliage and have oleifera cells that give trees a more fragrant aroma. Found throughout the Guyanas and the Amazon region, and also in the Pacific coastal areas of Colombia, they grow mostly in tropical forests and Andean cloud forest, but have also been found in stubbles and pastures. Distribution of Aniba extends from the islands of the Antilles in the Caribbean to Central America, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, the Guyanas, Venezuela, Colombia, and Peru in the coastal ranges and interior in wet areas, the Andes, and to dry regions of central and southern Brazil. They do not form large stands, but rather small groups of trees with densities up to one individual per five hectares. Due to the low density, exploitation of the natural populations is to the detriment of the rainforest. Overexploitation of the easily accessible trees of the rainforest has been reducing exports since the mid-1990s. Due to the distribution in inaccessible rainforest regions and its low density, it is hard to survey population trends in figures, but overexploitation is evident. http://www.dcsp.org/COP15-e.html Fourteen of the most known trees are used by the timber industry. In general, the wood from Aniba species has a high commercial value. The woods are typically yellowish with a greenish hue when fresh, becoming brown or olive on exposure to air. Narrow sapwood is light yellowish. Luster is medium to high; grain is straight to interlocked; texture is fine to medium; they have a spicy odor, and the taste may be distinctive.http://www.saber.ula.ve/bitstream/123456789/24181/1/articulo44_1_4.pdf Plantamed Spp.  Selected species  * Aniba anisosepala Sandwith * Aniba canelilla Mez * Aniba duckei, Kosterm. 1938 * Aniba ferrea, Kubitzki 1982 * Aniba ferruginea, Kubitzki 1982 * Aniba firmula, (Nees & Mart.)

He cited rampant corruption and increasing politization in the military. He stated that a plea bargain would be a ratification of Gloria Macapagal Arroyo's doubtful legitimacy. He also indicated that when he went to Oakwood he was well aware that his career or his life could have ended there.

There are some variations, but common designs include a plain colored field (usually red) with a pine tree in the canton. The eastern white pine (Pinus strobus) is the most common symbol of New England and often represents that tree's former importance in shipbuilding and New England's maritime culture. Design The flag of New England has two prominent symbols: a pine tree and red color. Other features, like the St. George's Cross is not always displayed on the flag, but the pine almost always is. There is a blue ensign and a red ensign variant. In each, St. George's cross is in the canton, whose top left corner is defaced with an image of a pine. Sometimes the blue ensign is defaced with six stars in a circle symbolizing the six states of New England. Another variant has a red ensign with an image of a Pine tree over a white field in the canton, and contains no cross; this was used by the New England Independence Movement and the New England Revolution. The red ensign was a common banner for other American colonies, as well, but the addition of a pine tree distinguished the New England colonies from their neighbors.Testi, Arnaldo (2010). Capture the Flag: The Stars and Stripes in American History. New York, N.Y: New York University Press. David B. Martucci. \\"The New England Flag\\". D. Martucci. Archived from the original History The pine tree has long been a symbol of New England. Most New England flags were based on the blue or red naval ensign of the Royal Navy which featured St George's Cross in the canton, which was used at both Jamestown, Virginia and Plymouth colony. Puritans in New England led by Roger Williams objected to the use of a Christian cross on their flag, and they flew a red flag with a plain white canton for a time.Mastai, pg 16 The new flag first appeared in 1634 in Salem, Massachusetts, but some considered it to be an act of rebellion against England and the cross was retained on crown property such as Castle Island (Massachusetts).Furlong, 39 The crossless flags became popular in New England, and militia companies designed unique patterns on their flags. In 1665, the Royal Commissioners recommended that all ships and militia companies be ordered to fly \\"the true colours of England, by which they may be knowne to be his majesties legittmate subjects.\\"Furlong, 40 The Flag of New England is a cultural and regional symbol. Nevertheless, some crossless flags were still in use as late as 1680, and New Englanders continued to look for ways to represent their country. In 1684, the town of Newbury, Massachusetts changed to a green flag, though retaining the Cross of St. George. A pine tree was added to some flags during the reign of King James II, possibly inspired by the pine tree shilling which was minted in Massachusetts. In 1707, a proclamation was issued that all merchant vessels fly the red ensign with the British Union Flag in the canton, and a woodcut was published in the Boston News-Letter on 26 January 1707 to ensure compliance, which was also the first illustration printed in an American newspaper.Furlong, 42 Some controversy exists concerning which flag flew at the Battle of Bunker Hill in 1775 at the onset of the American Revolutionary War. An officer of the Royal Marines reported that no flags were used by the Americans,Furlong, 68 but John Trumbull placed a red flag with a pine tree in his 1786 painting The Death of General Warren at the Battle of Bunker's Hill, 17 June 1775. However, he later painted another version of this painting for the family of the fallen general which depicts a blue flag. Another variation commonly used to represent the battle has a blue field with a white canton, the canton quartered with St. George's Cross and a tree. The flag of New England hanging According to author Boleslaw Mastai, the blue field was due to an error in a wood engraving which caused confusion among painters. The printing error might have been caused by incorrect \\"hatching\\", whereby parallel lines represent heraldic tinctures or colors; horizontal lines represent blue and vertical ones represent red. However, Benson John Lossing writes in Field Book of the Revolution that he interviewed the daughter of a Bunker Hill veteran who told her that he hoisted a blue flag on Breed's Hill prior to the battle.Lossing, Chapter 23, endnote 19 Regardless of its authenticity, the blue variation has become a symbol of the Battle of Bunker Hill and also of Charlestown, Boston, the neighborhood encompassing Bunker and Breed's hills. It was also featured on a 1968 US Postage Stamp. On June 8, 1998, K. Albert Ebinger of Ipswich, Massachusetts made a presentation to the New England Governor's Conference (NEGC) promoting a new design as the official flag of the NEGC. It is the blue \\"Bunker Hill Flag\\" defaced with six five-pointed stars in a circle in the fly to represent the six New England states. Ebinger had copyrighted this design in 1965, which the NEGC was unaware of when they adopted it. The New England Vexillological Association sent a letter of concern to the NEGC, which responded: > In 1998, Mr. Ebinger appeared before the New England Governors' Conference, > in Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada during the annual Conference of New > England Governors and Eastern Canadian Premiers and suggested [that] the > promotion of New England tourism would benefit from the use of a common > symbol, such as his \\"New England Flag\\". At that meeting, the governors > approved a motion to adopt the flag as the \\"official emblem of the New > England Conference\\". They did not make any claims as to its legitimacy as an > official or authentic flag of the six state region, nor did they adopt it as > the official flag of the region.

Although sometimes wrongly referred to as rosewood this name is totally misleading; it is no tree of the genus Dalbergia. It grows in parts of the tropical rainforest of South America. It is an endangered species that sees exploitation for its essential oil. Description Aniba rosodora grows in the tropical rainforests of South America. It is found in the Brazilian states of Amap√°, Amazonas, and Par√°. It is also found in Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Peru, Suriname, Venezuela, and French Guiana, where it was formerly more widespread. It is massive, up to 30 meters in height and 2 meters in diameter, and evergreen. The entire tree is fragrant. Substances in the tree include linalool and rubranine. The flowers are perfect, with temporal dioecy. The fruit is a purple drupe dispersed by toucans. It has 24 chromosomes. Gene flow is high between wild populations. Uses Structure of linalool, a substance extracted from A. rosodora The plant is one of the commercially important sources of rosewood oil. The tree is collected in the wild. After felling, the trees are cut into one-meter long logs which are taken to the riverbank and stockpiled there. When river levels are high enough, the logs are floated downriver to a distillery. Because of the remoteness and difficulty of travel in the Amazon, distilleries are often mobile, movable by raft. When they arrive at the distillery, the logs are chipped and then steam distilled. Each tree yields about 1% oil by weight of wood. Most worldwide production comes from Brazil; since the 1960s, other areas produce only a minor, insignificant amount. Trees are taken from near the Amazon and its tributaries. The wood may also be utilized by the indigenous peoples of the Amazon basin for the purposes of making canoes, but this is a minor use. In addition, old chips are used as fuel to run the distilleries. The Aniba rosodora is known as Pau-Rosa in Brazil. The supply of this wood was greatly overused in the past and it now is as difficult to legally trade as elephant ivory. Conservation Aniba rosodora is an endangered species. Populations have declined rapidly due to the destructive harvesting methods. Areas previously logged have not seen much regrowth. It might even be critically endangered. Wild populations exist in remote locations, which are hence unlikely to be exploited. The Brazilian government has enacted regulations to help conserve the species. There have been difficulties with enforcement. Early experiments in artificial cultivation and propagation were failures. More recent attempts have been more successful. It, or rather its wood and essential oil, is on Appendix II of CITES. If the leaves could be used as a source, it would help conserve the species. It has been suggested that production methods be altered to ensure a sustainable supply. It is also listed on the Official list of endangered flora of Brazil.

It is part of the electron transport chain. The enzyme is found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes and contains a flavin and FE-S cluster. In humans, it is encoded by the ETFDH gene. Deficiency in ETF dehydrogenase causes the human genetic disease multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency.  Function  ETQ-QO links the oxidation of fatty acids and some amino acids to oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria. Specifically, it catalyzes the transfer of electrons from electron transferring flavoprotein (ETF) to ubiquinone, reducing it to ubiquinol. The entire sequence of transfer reactions is as follows: Acyl-CoA ‚Üí Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase ‚Üí ETF ‚Üí ETF-QO ‚Üí UQ ‚Üí Complex III. = Catalyzed reaction = The overall reaction catalyzed by ETF-QO is as follows: ETF-QO(red) + ubiquinone ‚Üî ETF-QO(ox) + ubiquinol Enzymatic activity is usually assayed spectrophotometrically by reaction with octanoyl-CoA as the electron donor and ubiquinone-1 as the electron acceptor. The enzyme can also be assayed via disproportionation of ETF semiquinone. Both reactions are below: Octanoyl-CoA + Q1 ‚Üî Q1H2 + Oct-2-enoyl-CoA 2 ETF1- ‚Üî ETFox + ETF2- = Structure = ETF-QO Functional Domains ETF-QO consists of one structural domain with three functional domains packed in close proximity: a FAD domain, a 4Fe4S cluster domain, and a UQ-binding domain. FAD is in an extended conformation and is buried deeply within its functional domain. Multiple hydrogen bonds and a positive helix dipole modulate the redox potential of FAD and can possibly stabilize the anionic semiquinone intermediate. The 4Fe4S cluster is also stabilized by extensive hydrogen bonding around the cluster and its cysteine components. Ubiquinone binding is achieved through a deep hydrophobic binding pocket which is a different mode than other UQ-binding proteins such as succinate-Q oxidoreductase. Although ETF-QO is an integral membrane protein, it does not traverse the entire membrane unlike other UQ-binding proteins. = Mechanism = The exact mechanism for the reduction is unknown, although there are two hypothesized pathways. The first pathway is the transferral of electrons from one electron reduced ETF one at a time to the lower potential FAD center. One electron is transferred from the reduced FAD to the iron cluster, resulting in a two electron reduced state with one electron each on the FAD and cluster domains. Then, the bound ubiquinone is reduced to ubiquinol, at least transiently forming the singly reduced semiubiquinone. The second pathway involves the donation of electrons from ETF to the iron cluster, followed by internal transitions between the two electron centers. After equilibration, the rest of the pathway follows as above.  Clinical significance  Deficiency of ETF-QO results in a disorder known as glutaric acidemia type II (also known as MADD for multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency), in which there is an improper buildup of fats and proteins in the body. Complications can involve acidosis or hypoglycemia, with other symptoms such as general weakness, liver enlargement, increased heart failure, and carnitine deficiency. More severe cases involve congenital defects and full metabolic crisis. Genetically, it is an autosomal recessive disorder, making its occurrence fairly rare. Most affected patients are the result of single point mutations around the FAD ubiquinone interface. Milder forms of the disorder have been responsive to riboflavin therapy and are coined riboflavin-responsive MADD (RR-MADD), although due to the varying mutations causing the disease treatment and symptoms can vary considerably.

Ralph de Monthermer, 1st Baron Monthermer, Earl of Gloucester, Hertford, and Atholl (c. 1270 ‚Äì 5 April 1325) was an English nobleman, who was the son-in- law of King Edward I. His clandestine marriage to the King's widowed daughter Joan greatly offended her father, but he was quickly persuaded to pardon Ralph. Biography Of unknown parentage, Monthermer was born in Wales. Before 1296, he was a squire in the service of Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Gloucester and Hertford and his wife Joan of Acre, the daughter of Edward I. After Gloucester's death in 1295, the widowed countess fell in love with Monthermer, and after inducing her father to knight him, secretly married him in January 1297. When she was forced to reveal the marriage in April, the King was enraged, and had Monthermer imprisoned at Bristol. Thomas Walsingham relates that, while pleading for her husband, Joan told her father \\"No one sees anything wrong if a great earl marries a poor and lowly woman. Why should there be anything wrong if a countess marries a young and promising man?\\" With the intervention of Anthony Beck, Bishop of Durham, Edward relented, and released Monthermer from prison in August 1297. Monthermer then paid homage to Edward at Eltham Palace and was formally recognised as jure uxoris Earl of Gloucester and Hertford. In September 1297, Monthermer was summoned to attend a military council at Rochester, and would go on to take an active part in the Wars of Scottish Independence. He fought at the Battle of Falkirk in July 1298, and in the December of that year was granted the sum of ¬£1,538 6s. 8d., to pay for 100 barbed horses for use in the war. In 1300, Monthermer fought with his father-in-law at the siege of Caerlaverock. The Caerlaverock Roll, a poetic description of all the lords and knights present, refers to him thus (as translated from the original French): > He by whom they were well supported, Who brought to success the love, After > great doubts and fears, Until it pleased God he should be relieved, For the > Countess of Gloucester, For whom he long endured great sufferings. Of fine > gold with three red chevrons, He had there only a banner; Yet he made no bad > appearance, When he was attired in his own arms, Which were yellow with a > green eagle. His name was Ralph de Monthermer. Scottish wars Lord Monthermer's seal, as appended to the Barons' Letter of 1301, which was written to the Pope by the nobles of England, rejecting his claim to the feudal overlordship of Scotland In February 1301, Monthermer was summoned to a parliament at Lincoln, specially convened for the purpose of composing the Barons' Letter of 1301, which rejected Pope Boniface VIII's claim to the feudal overlordship of Scotland. On 24 June, he was summoned to Carlisle to serve with the Prince of Wales in the war against Scotland, and he was again summoned in 1303, 1304 and 1306. In the October of the latter year, King Edward conferred upon him the lands of Annandale in Scotland, as well as the earldom of Atholl; he later resigned the earldom to David Strathbogie, the son of the old Earl of Atholl, in exchange for the sum of 10,000 marks. In the winter he served as one of the king's three wardens in Scotland, and was besieged in Ayr Castle. In 1305 Monthermer warned Robert the Bruce, then at the English court, of the danger posed by King Edward. During a convivial evening Edward had let slip that he intended to arrest Bruce the next morning. Monthermer warned Bruce by sending him the sum of twelve pence and a pair of spurs. Bruce took the hint and he and his squire quickly departed the English court for Scotland. After the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314, at which Monthermer fought and was captured, Robert, now the victorious King of Scots, discharged the debt by releasing Ralph without ransom, but not before first entertaining him at table. Marmaduke Lord Thweng, also captured, joined them and was also then released without ransom. Later life His wife Joan died in 1307 at the manor of Clare in Suffolk, aged thirty-five. Her cause of death is not known for certain, but probably she died in childbirth. After her death, Monthermer lost his earldoms, which were held by right of his wife, to Gilbert de Clare, the son of the old Earl of Gloucester and Hertford, although in 1309 King Edward II summoned him to parliament as a baron, in the name of Lord Monthermer. In 1308 Monthermer brought a lawsuit against Richard de Beresford, Treasurer of Ireland, claiming that Richard was unlawfully in possession of most of the Irish property which should have come to Monthermer on Joan's death. His claim was successful. In 1307 Monthermer had been appointed keeper of Cardiff Castle and other castles in Wales, and from 1311 to 1312 he again served as warden in Scotland, for which he was paid 300 marks. In 1315 he was made warden of the royal forests south of the Trent, an office he continued to hold until 1320. In December 1315 he went on a pilgrimage to the Way of St James, during which time he appointed a deputy to carry out his duties in England. His second wife was Isabel le Despencer, the widow of Lord Hastings and a daughter of the Earl of Winchester, whom he married around 1313, also in secret; for this further transgression he was not pardoned until 1319. Ralph Lord Monthermer died in or before 1325, aged around 55, while his widow died in 1336. Issue By his first wife Joan, Monthermer probably had two sons and a daughter: * Mary de Monthermer (October 1297- c. 1371), married Duncan, Earl of Fife * Thomas, 2nd Lord Monthermer (1301‚Äì1340) * Edward de Monthermer (1304‚Äì1340), fought in the Scottish campaign in 1335, but spent much of his life in service to his half-sister Elizabeth, who provided for him during his last illness and buried him next to their mother References  1270 births 1325 deaths Barons in the Peerage of England Earls of Atholl 14th-century Scottish earls People of the Wars of Scottish Independence Ralph de Monthermer, 1st Baron Monthermer Earls of Hertford ","title":"Ralph de Monthermer, 1st Baron Monthermer"},{"id":"12855603","text":"Annona deceptrix is a species of plant in the Annonaceae family.

In producing their popular publications and rankings, these publishers \\"ask the same core questions\\" of institutions using the Common Data Set to define those questions and their responses. These data are also used in public accountability efforts such as the Voluntary System of Accountability's College Portrait. Annual CDS survey results Each year the Common Data Set initiative makes small changes to the \\"survey\\" submitted for every contributing college and university to complete. While the resulting database of all responses is not available for download, individual colleges and universities typically publish their individual responses on their own website. These individual responses can provide valuable information for students applying to a particular college or university. For example, section C7 - \\"Relative Importance of Common Academic and Non-Academic Admission Criteria\\" ‚Äì indicates the admission process for that college places on items like \\"Class Rank\\", \\"GPA\\", and \\"Extra-Curricular Activities\\". Another example is Sections C9 to C12, which give a statistical breakdown of SAT/ACT scores, class rank, and GPA for the current freshman class. This can be a good indicator, especially for the more selective colleges and universities, of the typical scores needed for admission. Sections on \\"Tuition and Fees\\" and \\"Financial Aid\\" can help potential applicants to understand the typical costs and potential aid they might receive based on the current freshman class statistics.

Early life  Simonton was born in West Hanover, southern Pennsylvania, and spent his childhood on the family's estate, named Antigua. His parents were the doctor and politician William Simonton (elected twice to Congress) and Mrs. Martha Davis Snodgrass (1791‚Äì1862), daughter of James Snodgrass, a Presbyterian minister, who was the pastor of the local church. Ashbel was named after Ashbel Green, president of New Jersey College. He was one among nine brothers and sisters. The boys (William, John, James, Thomas and Ashbel) used to call themselves the \\"quinque fratres\\" (five brothers). One of his brothers, James Snodgrass Simonton, four years older than Ashbel, was also a missionary to Brazil, spending three years as a teacher in the city of Vassouras, in the state of Rio de Janeiro. One of his four sisters, Elizabeth Wiggins Simonton (1822‚Äì1879), also called Lille, married the Presbyterian minister and missionary Alexander Latimer Blackford, a colleague of Simonton in Brazil and the co-founder of the Igreja Presbiteriana do Brasil.  Conversion  In 1846, the family moved to Harrisburg, where Simonton finished high school. After graduating in New Jersey College (the future Princeton University), in 1852, he spent about a year and a half in Mississippi, working as a teacher for young boys. Disappointed with the lack of attention by the local authorities for teaching, Simonton went back to Pennsylvania and tried to become a lawyer, although by that time many people would advise him to become a minister, something to which his mother had consecrated him at his birth. In 1855 he had a deep religious experience during a revival and went to the Princeton Seminary. In his first term, he heard in the seminary's chapel a sermon by Dr. Charles Hodge, one of his teachers, which moved him to the missionary work in foreign lands. He was ordained in 1859 and arrived in Brazil on August 12, the same year.  Ministry  Soon after organizing the Presbyterian church in Brazil (January 12, 1862), Simonton spent his vacation in the United States, where he married Helen Murdoch, in Baltimore. They came back to Brazil in July 1863. In the next year they became parents to Helen Murdoch Simonton, Simonton‚Äôs only daughter. Besides the Presbyterian Church, Simonton created a newspaper, Imprensa Evang√©lica (1864), along with a presbytery (1865) and a seminary (1867). Death Tombstone of Rev. Ashbel Green Simonton, Protestant Cemetery, S√£o Paulo In 1867, feeling ill, Simonton went to S√£o Paulo, where his sister and brother-in-law were raising his daughter.

It is one of eight putative species in the genus Anogramma. It was thought to have become extinct due to habitat loss, until four plants were found on the island in 2010. Over 60 specimens were then successfully cultivated at Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew and on Ascension Island. It is now classified as Critically Endangered. The small fern has delicate yellow-green leaves which appear similar to small sprigs of parsley. It was first recorded in 1842 by an amateur botanist, Dr A.B. Curror, and then officially described and named by Joseph Dalton Hooker after a visit he made to the island in 1843. It is endemic to the steep slopes of Green Mountain on the island. Another specimen was recorded in 1889, with few or no reports of specimens again until 1958, when a British scientist collected one on the north slope of the mountain. Further searches were conducted in 1976, 1986 and 1995 but were unsuccessful, and in 2003 it was officially declared extinct. There are ten species of plants endemic to Ascension Island, with seven of them still known to survive. The island lost much of its native habitat due to invasive animals and plants, beginning with goats introduced in the 16th century by Portuguese explorers. Other non-native animals, including rabbits, sheep, donkeys, and rats‚Äîalong with over 200 non-native plant species‚Äîhave destroyed much of the original habitat and plants. The introduction of non- native plants and animals was greatly hastened beginning in 1847, when Joseph Dalton Hooker advised the Royal Navy to import plants to the island to change the dry cinder soil and arid climate. Kew Gardens, whose director at the time was Hooker's father, helped ship trees to Ascension Island beginning in 1850. Green Mountain in particular was transformed through their efforts. Competition from invasive and non-native maidenhair fern (Adiantum) is believed to be partly responsible for the demise of A. ascensionis. A. ascensionis was rediscovered during a routine plant survey being performed by a team from the Ascension Island Government's Conservation Department. Because it was found growing in dry rock, on a very steep ridge, the four plants had to be watered and kept alive long enough to produce spores. Two of the plants produced spores before they died. After harvesting, the spores were quickly airlifted to Kew Gardens, where they were placed in a sterile environment to produce sporelings. Sixty new ferns were raised at Kew, along with more on Ascension Island. Since then, a small number of plants were discovered growing near the original four.

History On July 30, 1847, an ecclesiastical territory was established as the Apostolic Vicariate of Cape of Good Hope, Eastern District from the Apostolic Vicariate of Cape of Good Hope and adjacent territories. Later the Eastern Vicariate was itself subdivided three times. On 27 December 1847, Dr. Aidan Devereux was consecrated, in Cape Town, Bishop of Paneas and first Vicar Apostolic of the Eastern Vicariate, by Dr. Griffith, under whom he had worked for nine years. Through the Dhanis family of Belgium the new vicar Apostolic received the first considerable funds to start work. But his life was spent in the turmoil of wars, and was a struggle with poverty and the dearth of priests. His successor, Dr. Patrick Moran, had been curate of Irishtown, Dublin, and arrived in the colony in November, 1856. He was a man of energy, and a strenuous opponent of the grant of responsible government. The Sacred Congregation of Propaganda appointed him first Bishop of Dunedin, New Zealand, in 1870. Next year, the Rev. James David Richards was consecrated bishop at Grahamstown, as titular bishop of Retimo, by the Vicar Apostolic of Natal, Dr. Allard. Dr. Richards had already spent twenty-two years in the country and, whether as a writer, or lecturer, or pastor, had left his mark in the land. He founded the Cape Colonist, a paper which had campaigning views on purity in public life and on the native problems. In 1880 he brought to South Africa the first contingent of Trappists, as teachers. About two years before Dr. Ricards's death a coadjutor was appointed in the person of Dr. Peter Strobino, who, however, became an invalid soon after the death of Dr. Ricards. Dr. Strobino was succeeded in 1896 by his coadjutor, the Rt. Rev. Hugh MacSherry, formerly administrator of the diocese of Dundalk in Ireland, who had been consecrated a few months before.Wikisource:Catholic Encyclopedia (1913)/Eastern Vicariate of the Cape of Good Hope * June 13, 1939: Renamed as Apostolic Vicariate of Port Elizabeth * January 11, 1951: Promoted as Diocese of Port Elizabeth Special churches * The cathedral is Cathedral of St. Augustine in Port Elizabeth. * The Port Elizabeth Oratory serves the parish of St Bernadette in Walmer.

They can be functionally classified into constitutive, \\"housekeeping\\" ETFs, mainly involved in the oxidation of fatty acids (Group I), and ETFs produced by some prokaryotes under specific growth conditions, receiving electrons only from the oxidation of specific substrates (Group II). ETFs are heterodimeric proteins composed of an alpha and beta subunit (ETFA and ETFB), and contain an FAD cofactor and AMP. ETF consists of three domains: domains I and II are formed by the N- and C-terminal portions of the alpha subunit, respectively, while domain III is formed by the beta subunit. Domains I and III share an almost identical alpha-beta-alpha sandwich fold, while domain II forms an alpha-beta-alpha sandwich similar to that of bacterial flavodoxins.

It is composed of five villages; Lanslebourg, Lanslevillard, Termignon, Solli√®res-Sardi√®res and Bramans. The villages sit between 1200m and 1500m, respectively, and lifts climb to a maximum altitude of 2740m. The resort is not very well known due to its location at the end of a valley and difficulty of access and attracts a mainly French, Italian, Belgian and Dutch contingent each winter. It is a lot quieter than larger ski resorts in the French Alps and does not normally suffer from long lift queues. It is ideally located in the Maurienne region with good transport links in and out of Modane, Lyon, Geneva and Chambery. At the top of the mountain lays Lac du Mont Cenis; in the summer or the winter this is a delightful sight. In the winter the lake freezes and allows for beautiful pictures from the Canop√©e des C√Æmes, a suspended boat shaped platform.  Skiing  Val Cenis ski area cover Termignon, Lanslebourg and Lanslevillard. It is open to skiers and snowboarders from December to April each year. It has terrain to cater for all abilities, although is perhaps more suited to intermediates than anyone else. There are 9 green runs, 10 blue runs, 18 red runs, and 6 black runs, as well as 2 gondolas, 10 chairlifts, and 8 drag lifts. One of the major attractions of Val Cenis is the existence of blue pistes from top to bottom, which allows beginners to enjoy the heights of the mountain which they may not be able to reach at other resorts. Amongst its pistes Val Cenis boasts the longest green run in Europe; the 10km l'Escargot, which doubles as a road in summer, winds down from 2100m to 1400m. The lower section of the slopes are through trees, which means they are not exposed to wind and sun and tend to have better snow cover, although the scope for off- piste skiing is limited. Above the trees, from 2100m upwards, there is an abundance of off-piste skiing to be found. Impressive backcountry skiing can be found past the slopes at the Lanslevillard end of the resort, with several wide gullies within a large forested area. From the top of the TSF4 de la Met lift to 2800m there are panoramic views of the Lac du Mont Cenis almost 800m below, as well as several pistes running down to the lake's shore. There is now even more skiing available from Val Cenis as the resort makes one with neighbouring Termignon offering 125km of pistes. The Eski-Mo pass includes Val frejus, Aussois, la Norma, Val Cenis and Bonneval sur arc, the exclusive chocolate box ski resort And Bessans is an eldorado for cross country and biathlon on the highest altiplano of Maurienne.

Playing career The son of the former Barnsley and Lincoln City player Ron Smillie, Neil Smillie began his career with Crystal Palace, where he spent seven years, during which he had a spell on loan at Brentford and also spent two summers playing for Memphis Rogues in the North American Soccer League. In 1982, he was sold to Brighton & Hove Albion. During his time with that club, he played in the 1983 FA Cup Final, in which Brighton held Manchester United to a 2‚Äì2 draw before losing in a replay. In 1985, Smillie moved to Watford for a fee of ¬£100,000 but his spell at Vicarage Road was unsuccessful, with only 16 first-team appearances in three years. In 1988, he moved on to Reading. A year later, he moved again to Brentford, where he was a first-team regular for five years with over 170 appearances. Managerial career In 1993, the new Gillingham manager Mike Flanagan made Smillie his first signing, appointing him as player-coach. Gillingham went into administration in 1995 and the receivers dismissed Flanagan as manager, appointing Smillie as manager for the remainder of the season. When new owners took over Gillingham in summer 1995, Smillie moved to Wycombe Wanderers, where he served as youth team coach. He had a brief spell as caretaker manager in 1996 and, in 1998, gained the job on a permanent basis. He was sacked the following year.

Funk art is an American art movement that was a reaction against the nonobjectivity of abstract expressionism. An anti-establishment movement, Funk art brought figuration back as subject matter in painting again rather than limiting itself to the non-figurative, abstract forms that abstract expressionists such as Jackson Pollock and Mark Rothko were depicting. The movement's name was derived from the jazz musical term \\"funky\\", describing the passionate, sensuous, and quirky. During the 1920s, jazz was thought of as very basic, unsophisticated music, and many people believed Funk was an unrefined style of art as well. The term funk also had negative connotations because the word had an association with a foul odor. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Funk was a popular art form, mainly in California's Bay Area in the United States. Although discussed as a cohesive movement, Funk artists did not feel as if they belonged to a collective art style or group.Karlstrom, Paul J. Peter Selz: Sketches of a Life in Art. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2012. This is because while its artists shared the same attitudes and created similar works, they were not necessarily working together. History =Bay Area= The Funk art movement was a regional art movement, most predominant in Northern California. Some notable cities that the Funk movement was concentrated in are Berkeley, Marin County, Big Sur, Davis and North Beach. Many Funk artists began as Bay Area Figurative Movement painters in the 1950s. The movement originated from the bohemian underground in the Bay Area.Engelbach, Barbara Looking for Mushrooms: Beat Poets, Hippies, Funk, Minimal Art San Francisco 1955-68. K√∂ln K√∂nig: Museum Ludwig, K√∂ln, 2008. During the 1960s, the Bay Area, specifically San Francisco, was a free and spiritual environment due to its beatnik art culture and the youth political activism reacting against the Vietnam War going on at the time. A variety of different cultures existed in the city, including poetry, jazz, and art. The freedom of thinking and culture was one of the main reasons that Funk art, a combination of both painting and sculpture, could develop and prosper in the Bay Area. The Funk art that occurred throughout Northern California was the exact opposite of the \\"Fetish Finish\\" sculptures made in Southern California and the \\"primary structures\\" constructed in New York at the time.Selz, Peter. Funk. Berkeley: The Regents of the University of California, 1967. Funk art in the Bay Area was unique and not similar to any other movement of the 1960s. Jess, Wally Hedrick, Jay DeFeo, Viola Frey, Wallace Berman, Maija Peeples- Bright, and Bruce Conner were notable Funk artists who emerged from the Bay Area. Jess was one of the earliest and most influential Funk artists. In 1967, Peter Selz, the first director of the University of Art Museum in Berkeley, California, organized a Funk Show there. Selz wanted to showcase the strange mindset in California through an array of Funk pieces. The exhibition featured works from Peter Voulkos, Mowry Baden and Bruce Conner, and it brought national recognition to the movement for the first time.Albright, Thomas. Art in the San Francisco Bay Area 1945-1980. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1985. Before this show, not many people outside of the Bay Area had seen or heard of Funk works, which relieved artists of pressures to become successful. Characteristics and techniques The characteristics and techniques of Funk art works were more important than the subject matter. =Self-identification= Unlike earlier movements, such as Dada and Surrealism, Funk art was not concerned with public morality. Its artists were committed to identifying with their works on a personal level instead of the social, political, or existential. Through their absurdist works, Funk artists demonstrated personal feelings, emotions, and processes, and, in this way, their work may be said to have a closer relationship to nature rather than to culture, often featuring animals as subject matter. The works championed creative freedom and reflected the artists' lives, personalities, and experiences. Funk artists imbued their work with a sense of humor, senselessness, confrontation, vulgar sexuality, and autobiographical references. In their pieces, Funk artists are sometimes self-deprecating and ironic. Although the artworks may be humorous, they may also convey a more serious undertone at times. Since many of the pieces lacked a clear meaning, Funk art often contains a sense of ambiguity. =Found objects= Funk art was inspired by popular culture, may be brash or crude, and uses an unlikely mixture of materials and techniques. One of the movement's main characteristics the incorporation of found objects from consumer culture. It was part of a larger movement called Assemblage, which also included paintings that were composed of three-dimensional objects. Bruce Conner was known for his assemblage works, including Arachne, Spider Lady, For Marilyn, Cosmic Death Song, and Tick Tock Jelly Clock Cosmotron. Many of the Funk assemblage pieces were composed of thrown out garbage to demonstrate that Funk art was not a part of consumer culture. The pieces are usually three dimensional, but they resemble paintings more than sculptures. Jess and Wally Hedrick were two of the first Funk artists to use found objects in their works. The objects used tended to be items that were not meant to be noticed. The idea of using ordinary subject matter and common objects in art was influenced by Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns. This concept is also influenced by the pieces of the Dada movement because both art movements use everyday objects and convey a sense of freedom. The objects and debris used in works symbolized decay much of the time. Due to the artists' lack of concern with technique, form, or durability, the works have a somewhat haphazard, spontaneous feel to them. Ceramics Non-functional ceramic art was an important element in the Funk art movement, especially in Regina, the San Francisco Bay Area and Davis. Funk art ceramics were primarily composed from clay and sometimes possessed themes that were thought of as inappropriate. Similar to its three dimensional paintings, Funk ceramics contained vulgar male humor, as well as sexual references.Shields, Scott A. \\"California Funk.\\" Ceramics Monthly 56.9 (2008): 38-41. Academic Search Complete. Web. 12 Mar. 2012. Like other Funk works, the ceramics also used funny and absurd styles and images to relay the message that people should not take art or themselves too seriously. The ceramics were unrefined and blatant, and they all possessed the idea of a functionless sculpture for sculptures sake. =Robert Arneson= Robert Arneson started the ceramic art movement within Funk art in the Bay Area. Before him, ceramics were considered more of a craft rather than a prestigious art form. After him, ceramics caught on as a serious form of art nationally. Robert Arneson created many ceramic sculptures, which eventually became a common work of Funk artists. Some believe his ceramics were influenced by pop art sculptures because they were of mundane, everyday objects. A main difference was that Robert Arneson also included personal elements to his sculptures, which was a defining factor of Funk art. His works were playful and full of color. Robert Arneson, along with other Funk artists, such as Roy De Forest, Manuel Neri, and William T. Wiley taught at the University of California, Davis, which was a center for the movement.Smithsonian Archives of American Art, Interview with Bruce Nauman http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/oralhistories/transcripts/nauman80.htm Students from University of California, Davis, such as Margaret Dodd, David Gilhooly, Victor Cicansky, Chris Unterseher, Peter Vandenberge, and Maija Peeples-Bright continued Arneson's ceramics tradition. In 1967, Robert Arneson drafted ceramicist Clayton Bailey to cover his classes at University of California, Davis while he took a sabbatical. Bailey, who hailed from Wisconsin, had been pursuing a personal, but similar artistic vision to what had been happening with the Funk art movement in northern California. In 1968, Bailey permanently relocated to the Bay Area, where he soon became a key figure in the region's developing Funk art scene. Exhibitions Founded in Folsom, California, in 1962, the Candy Store Gallery played a key role in promoting Funk art by means of regular exhibitions until its closure in 1992.

The model posits an internal clock, and particular memory and decision processes. SET is one of the most important models of animal timing behavior. History John Gibbon originally proposed SET to explain the temporally controlled behavior of non- human subjects. He initially used the model to account for a pattern of behavior seen in animals that are being reinforced at fixed-intervals, for example every 2 minutes. An animal that is well trained on such a fixed- interval schedule pauses after each reinforcement and then suddenly starts responding about two-thirds of the way through the new interval. (See operant conditioning) The model explains how the animal's behavior is controlled by time in this manner. Gibbon and others later elaborated the model and applied it to a variety of other timing phenomena. Summary of the model SET assumes that the animal has a clock, a working memory, a reference memory, and a decision process. The clock contains a discrete pacemaker that generates pulses like the ticks a mechanical clock. A stimulus that signals the start of a timed interval closes a switch, allowing pulses to enter an accumulator. The resulting accumulation of pulses represents elapsed time, and this time value is continuously sent to a working memory. When reinforcement happens at the end of the timed interval, the time value is stored in a long-term reference memory. This time-to-reinforcement in reference memory represents the expected time to reinforcement. Key to the SET model is the decision process that controls timing behavior. While the animal is timing some interval it continually compares the current time (stored in working memory) to the expected time (stored in reference memory). Specifically, the animal continually samples from its memory of past times at which reinforcement occurred and compares this memory sample with the current time on its clock. When the two values are close to one another the animal responds; when they are far enough apart, the animal stops responding. To make this comparison, it computes the ratio of the two values; when the ratio is less than a certain value it responds, when the ratio is larger it does not respond. By using a ratio of current time to expected time, rather than, for example, simply subtracting one from the other, SET accounts for a key observation about animal and human timing. That is, timing accuracy is relative to the size of the interval being timed. This is the \\"scalar\\" property that gives the model its name. For example, when timing a 10 sec interval an animal might be accurate to within 1 sec, whereas when timing a 100 sec interval the animal would be accurate to only about 10 sec. Thus time perception is like the perception of lights, sounds, and other sensory events, where accuracy also is relative to the size (brightness, loudness, etc.) of the percept being judged. (See Weber-Fechner law.) A number of alternative models of timing have appeared over the years. These include Killeen‚Äôs Behavioral Theory of timing (BeT) model and Machado‚Äôs learning-to-time (LeT) model. Moreover, there are some evidence that this property might not be valid in all ranges of durations. Additionally John Staddon argues that SET is inconsistent on explaining the location of temporal indifference point in temporal bisection procedure. Human mechanism In 1993, John Wearden claimed that human behavior exhibits appropriate scalar properties, as was indicated by experiments on internal production with concurrent chronometric counting. However, human timing behavior is undoubtedly more varied than animal timing behavior. A major factor responsible for this variability is attentional allocation.

The Worsley family of Platt Hall Platt Hall and Costume Museum A branch of the Worsley family settled at Platt Hall, Lancashire, now in Fallowfield in the City of Manchester. The hall was bought by Ralph Worsley (1625) from the Platt family. Ralph Worsley's father, Charles, was the great grandson of Sir Geoffrey Worsley of Boothes and a kinsman of the Worsleys of Worsley Hall (from whom derived the Worsleys of Appuldurcombe and of Hovingham). Raph Worsley's son, Major-General Charles Worsley, was an eminent Parliamentary soldier in the English Civil War. Having reduced the Isle of Man in 1650, he commanded the troops who accompanied Oliver Cromwell into the British House of Commons in 1653, when Cromwell ordered Worsley to 'seize that bauble', whereupon he seized the mace, which was kept at Platt Hall for many years. Worsley later became major general for Lancashire, Cheshire and Derbyshire in the Rule of the Major Generals. On his death, in 1657, he was buried with great pomp in Westminster Abbey and is the only Parliamentarian whose remains still lie buried there. Charles Worsley's family remained at Platt Hall until 1906, when it was sold to the Manchester Corporation, due to the encroachment of the city on its estate. Elizabeth Tindal-Carill-Worsley, who sold the estate, was the granddaughter of the explorer and physician Sir Francis Sacheverel Darwin, son of the eminent scientist, physician and poet Dr Erasmus Darwin. She married Nicolas Tindal of Aylesbury, a great grand-nephew of Sir Nicholas Conyngham Tindal, Lord Chief Justice of England from 1829 ‚Äì 1843.

His film debut was in the 1912 production The Lovers' Signal. Over the next 23 years, he performed in no less than 172 additional films. Early life McKee was born in Keokuk, Iowa. Genealogical records indicate that his parents were Albert N. McKee and Alice Yetter McKee. During World War I, he was an Army lieutenant in France and reportedly wore his uniform in four war-themed films. Stage and film careers On Broadway, McKee portrayed Jack Weaver in The Phantom Legion (1919). He also acted on stage in A Fool There Was, The Fortune Teller, and Madame X. Early in his acting career, McKee also made films in the eastern United States for the Edison and Lubin studios and was billed as \\"Roy McKee\\". From 1926 to 1928, he was associated with Mack Sennett, with McKee portraying Jimmy Smith in a series of approximately 30 Smith Family comedy films. Personal life and death During the filming of The Unbeliever in 1918, McKee worked with his future wife, actress Marguerite Courtot. The two performers worked together again in 1922 in the production Down to the Sea in Ships. They wed the following year on April 14 and remained married for nearly 60 years, until Raymond's death. After retiring from acting, McKee focused his attention on The Zulu Hut, a restaurant that he originally opened in Los Angeles in the 1920s.

It was fought between the forces of George Gordon, 4th Earl of Huntly, chief of Clan Gordon against the forces of Mary, Queen of Scots under James Stewart, 1st Earl of Moray. Huntly had defeated the English twenty years earlier at the Battle of Haddon Rig, however at Corrichie he was defeated by Queen Mary's forces, and apparently he died of apoplexy after his capture. Mary had come in person to the north of Scotland intent on confronting the power of the Gordons. At Corrichie, the Gordon's tactic of charging with swords was defeated by Moray's pike drill.for Highland sword charges, see; Cowan, Ross, 'Weapon of Deeds', Medieval Warfare 1.3 (2011) Context George Buchanan described the events of 1562 in his History of Scotland. The Earl of Huntly had lost the earldoms of Moray and Mar, which he considered his heritage, and became an enemy of the new Earl of Moray, the half-brother of Mary, Queen of Scots. Mary and Moray arrived at Aberdeen in mid-August, and met the Earl and Countess of Huntly. A stumbling block in their discussions was the case of their son, John Gordon. Mary wished that he be imprisoned in Stirling Castle. (It had previously been suggested that John might marry Mary, but only in order to manipulate his father.) Mary and Huntly journeyed together towards Huntly Castle but the Queen, impatient at Huntly's refusal to hand over his son turned back.Gatherer, W.A., 'Queen Mary's Journey, 1562', in, SHR, vol.33, no.115, (April 1954), ,19-12 comments on this detail The English diplomat Thomas Randolph wrote that Mary came within four miles of Huntly Castle, but would not go there. Randolph accepted an invitation and stayed two nights, commenting that the house was \\"fayer, beste furnishede of anye howse that I have seen in thys countrie.\\"CSP. Foreign, Elizabeth, vol. 5 (1867), no.648, 18 September: CSP. Scotland, vol.1 (1898), p.652 no.1139 Mary and her court then travelled to Inverness Castle, but the Gordon Captain refused to give the royal castle to the Queen's representative. At this time the Clan Chattan deserted Huntly and joined the Queen, and others of what Buchanan calls the \\"ancient Scots\\" meaning the G√†idhealtachd came to her aid, with the Frasers and Munros. They easily took Inverness Castle on 9 September, and the Gordon garrison was executed (or at least, the Captain). Mary and her court returned to Aberdeen. Huntly tried to get intelligence of the Queen's intentions via his cousin the Earl of Sutherland, but Sutherland's correspondence was discovered and he was forced to flee. Huntly was now close to Aberdeen at Corrichie. The English diplomat Thomas Randolph, who accompanied Queen Mary to Aberdeen, described the battle in letters to William Cecil. These letters add more detail. Randolph says that Huntly had a royal cannon at Huntly Castle (then called Strathbogie) which he had been given by Regent Arran. Mary demanded its return with short notice. Her men went to Huntly Castle on 9 October and attempted to capture the Earl, but he escaped over a low wall at the back gate. The Countess of Huntly stayed at Strathbogie and the Earl went to his house at Badenoch, the site of Ruthven Barracks, and was declared a rebel on 17 October. John Knox mentions another incident which angered the Queen; Mary had sent Captain Stewart with 60 men to seize Findlater Castle. They were surprised in the night at Cullen by Huntly's son John Gordon and sustained a number of casualties. Corrichie, hill, and marsh According to Thomas Randolph, Huntly marched towards Aberdeen with 700 men, and was said to have intended to capture the Queen. Two thousand men led by the Earls of Moray, Atholl, and Morton encircled his encampment on 28 October 1562. The Gordons, now numbering 500, had camped on a hill (said Randolph), where the cavalry could not reach them, but arquebus shot drove them down to marshy ground where they were cornered. The Queen's army attacked, and at first her vanguard lost their nerve and threw away their spears. The Earl of Moray forced them to fight. Randolph wrote the battle ended \\"incontinent\\" meaning it was over straight away. About 120 Gordons were killed and about 100 captured. Randolph wrote that none of the Queen's army were killed but many were hurt and many horses were killed. The Earl of Huntly was mounted on a horse to be taken to Aberdeen as a captive and before leaving the battlefield suddenly and soundlessly died. George Buchanan says that Huntly waited for Moray's army in \\"a place surrounded by marshes,\\" and \\"fortified by nature.\\" Moray gained a small hill as a vantage point that overlooked Huntly's position. Buchanan wrote that Moray's vanguard broke because of the many 'traitors,' who would not fight against Huntly and fixed heather on their bonnets. He continues that the Gordons threw away their spears expecting to use their swords in a pursuit. Moray and his second line stayed firm with extended pikes, despite the retreating vanguard who were forced to go around the pike line on either side. Moray's pikemen won the day because of the length of their pikes, Huntly's men being unable to approach. John Knox in his History of the Reformation gave further details. The Earl of Huntly got up late on the morning of the battle which did not help morale. Knox gives him some speeches, making the observation that Moray's vanguard was composed of his friends, and the small company on the hill side (Moray's pike men) were to be feared. Huntly's position was Corrichie Burn or the Fara Bank, meaning a slope amidst the Hills o'Fare. After the vanguard broke, Knox credits the resolution of the second line to John Wishart of Pitarrow, the Master of Lindsay, and the Tutor of Pitcur who marched forward with their \\"spears\\" through the retreating vanguard. Knox attributes a speech to the Queen's secretary William Maitland of Lethington who prayed for victory. Aftermath Delgatie Castle, where Mary, Queen of Scots stayed after the Battle of Corrichie The \\"Queen's Chair\\", where according to an erroneous tradition, Mary, Queen of Scots viewed the battlefield of Corrichie. After the battle, Huntly's eldest son Sir John Gordon was taken to Aberdeen and executed three days later. A younger brother Adam Gordon of Auchindoun, also captured at Corrichie, was spared. The Earls body was preserved and taken to Edinburgh for trial. Huntly's cousin John Gordon, 11th Earl of Sutherland fled to Louvain in Flanders. At the Parliament of Scotland on 28 May 1563, in the presence of Queen Mary, Huntly, Sutherland, and as John Knox noted eleven other Earls and Barons of the name Gordon were forfeited.Bain, Joseph, ed., Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol.2 (1900), p.10 In 1565 Queen Mary of Scotland restored the Earls of Huntly, Sutherland and others of the name Gordon who had been forfeited. The Earl of Sutherland was invited to return to Scotland. The Earl of Bedford, Governor of Berwick on Tweed sent a privateer called Wilson who carried Swedish letters of marque to intercept his ship, and the Earl was imprisoned at Berwick. Sutherland was considered a danger to English policy in Scotland. Mary, Queen of Scots, demanded the release of the Earl, who was now sick with an ague. Bedford wrote to Elizabeth I of England on his behalf. The Earl was released in February 1566 after the assurance that he was reconciled with the Earl of Moray. On his return he married Marion Seton, daughter of Lord Seton. Both were poisoned at Helmsdale Castle by Isobel Sinclair, and died at Dunrobin Castle on 23 June 1567.

Howard, belonging to the Cthulhu Mythos. It was first published in the pulp magazine Weird Tales in the June 1934 issue. Howard earned $60 for this publication.REHupa , retrieved 20 August 2007 This story is set in the modern age but includes a relic from the Hyborian Age of the Conan the Barbarian stories, the ring of Thoth-Amon. Plot Evelyn Gordon has tried on three occasions to murder her newly wed husband, James Gordon, although she has no memory of doing so after the event. James believes that she may be the reincarnation of Elizabeth Douglas, the wife of his ancestor, Richard Gordon, who murdered her out of jealousy; and the attempts on his life are the result of her vengeance on the family line. Evelyn has also, however, recently received a present from her spurned lover, Joseph Roelocke, as a peace offering - a copper ring \\"made like a scaly snake coiled three times, with its tail in its mouth and yellow jewels for eyes.\\" James believes Roelocke found the ring somewhere in Hungary. On hearing this story, and viewing the circumstances themselves, John Kirowan becomes suspicious. Following another attempt on James Gordon's life, Kirowan confronts Roelocke and the mystery is explained. Roelocke is really Yosef Vrolok, an old enemy of Kirowan. Kirowan identified the ring as \\"the ancient and accursed ring of Thoth-Amon, handed down by foul cults of sorcerers since the days of forgotten Stygia\\" In revenge against Evelyn, Vrolok used black magic to summon a \\"black elemental spirit\\" (also \\"the nameless shape that roams the gulfs of Darkness\\") to possess her and force her to kill her husband, although it can only manage to do this on brief occasions. His plan backfires, however, as he promised the spirit the soul of either Evelyn or James Gordon in payment for its services. Kirowan convinces him that, as he had no authority to give their souls, the spirit will come for Vrolok's soul instead. Despite the fact that the spirit's task has not yet been completed, this gambit weakens Vrolok's control enough that the spirit is able to take advantage and, indeed, Vrolok's soul. Links to Conan The Serpent Ring of Set was introduced in the very first Conan story, The Phoenix on the Sword with a similar description. In that story, it is reclaimed by its most famous owner, the Stygian wizard Thoth-Amon, who is named as such in this story. This establishes a link between the Conan and Kirowan stories, and through them links to many other works by Robert E. Howard, including Kull and Bran Mak Morn.

A brokered program is typically not capable of garnering enough support from advertisements to pay for itself, and may be controversial, esoteric or an advertisement in itself. Overview =Common examples= Common examples are religious and political programs and talk-show-format programs similar to infomercial on television. Others are hobby programs or vanity programs paid for by the host and/or his supporters, and may be intended to promote the host's personality, for instance in preparation for a political campaign, or to promote a product, service or business that the host is closely associated with. A live vanity show may be carried on several stations by remote broadcast or simulcast, with the producer paying multiple stations an airtime fee. Financial advisors and planners often produce this kind of programming. Brokered commercial programs promote products or services by scripting shows made to sound similar to talk radio or news programming, and may even include calls from actual listeners (or actors playing the part of listeners). The programs are a specific type of infomercial, as they focus on a topic related to the product and repeatedly steer listeners and \\"callers\\" to a particular website and/or toll-free telephone number in order to purchase the product being featured. Although presented in the style of live programs, these are typically pre-recorded and supplied to stations on tape, disc, or digital downloadable formats, such as MP3 files. Such programming is most common on talk radio stations and used to fill non-prime time slots and to augment income from spot-advertisement sales during normal programs.Canadian talk radio station discusses adopting its first brokered program Most of these programs feature a disclaimer at either the beginning or the end of the program (or both), usually read by the program's host or (most often) by a separate announcer; some radio stations play a standard disclaimer before all such programs. Certain mainstream sports and entertainment broadcasts may resort to buying brokered airtime to air on television if they cannot secure a deal that pays rights fees or a barter agreement. Examples include the last years of the Professional Bowlers Tour, Major League Baseball's short-lived The Baseball Network venture in the mid-1990s, professional football leagues such as the United Football League and Alliance of American Football, and motorsports events produced and sponsored by Lucas Oil. In the case of professional football, brokered programming has typically not been feasible in the long term, as the sport requires rights fees to make it viable; leagues that have relied on brokering television time have collapsed in short order due to financial losses. Regional sports networks also pad their non-play-by-play schedule with brokered shows catering to niches like high school sports, poker, and all- terrain vehicles. =Radio= Talk radio Although some syndicators of multi-topic, ad-supported talk shows may pay a fee to stations with very large Arbitron-verified listenership, the same syndicator will normally charge a fee to small stations and may charge nothing to stations with moderate listenership. Each arrangement depends on whether the station can deliver enough listeners to allow the syndicator to earn money from ad sales. Syndicated programs normally carry a number of their own advertisements that must be played during commercial breaks, but set aside time for local stations to play their own advertisements. Stations also frequently employ one or more of their own hosts, but at some small stations these hosts may be unpaid volunteers motivated by the chance to promote an agenda, gain personal exposure or get work experience. The use of brokered programming varies by station -- some stations, mainly news radio and sports radio stations, use brokered programming to fill holes in some dayparts, especially during the late-night hours and weekends. The format of brokered programs varies; many sports radio stations will use brokered programs from sports handicappers and prognosticators to fit their format, while news and talk radio stations will often rely on brokered programs that sell vitamin or nutritional supplements, financial planning products and services, and alternative medical products, fitting those stations' older audiences. Sometimes, even programs dealing with gardening and home improvement (usually presented on weekend mornings on many talk radio stations) are broadcast under a brokered arrangement, as was the case with KRLD gardening expert Neil Sperry before his show was canceled outright in 2010. Program time is often brokered to churches on Sunday mornings in a manner that parallels televangelism; there are also religious stations that rely primarily on brokered programs, and these stations often get the derisive title of \\"pay for pray,\\" a play on the unethical practice of \\"pay for play\\" on music stations. There are also some AM radio stations that are dedicated to the brokered format, selling time for as little as 15 minutes or even selling the entire broadcasting day to a single entity, with the station holding the broadcast license and providing the facilities. That long- form type of brokered programming is especially popular among ethnic and religious broadcasters as well as with privately owned U.S.-based shortwave radio broadcasters. Music radio programs Brokered programs are not exclusive to talk radio; music radio programs can also be brokered. The brokered format, popular among specialty and niche music formats (i.e. polka music), usually involves the show itself lining up its own advertising and paying the station for its airtime. The idea reduces the risk for the station and assures the show remains on the air as long as the show's producers continue to pay the station's airtime fee. =Record companies= Record companies (through independent promoters) may also purchase brokered time on music stations to have the station play a new single as a \\"preview\\", which has the potential to be inserted onto a station's general playlist but has not received the traction to do so. These spots are often the length of the song with an introduction and disclaimer at the end of the song stating the artist, album title, and releasing label, and come under titles such as CD Preview. The segments must be carefully disclaimed by the record companies so as to not violate payola laws and the playing of the song, as it is paid for, cannot be applied to song popularity charts, as has happened in the early 2000s with some forms of this concept.http://www.thedailypage.com/isthmus/article.php?article=5303 =Brokered time through agencies= Oftentimes broadcasters will seek the help of an ad agency to secure a brokered radio show. Agencies such as I Buy Time in Dallas, Texas or Bayliss Media Group in Los Angeles, California have the knowledge on how to negotiate a lower per-hour rate than what may be quoted by the radio station to the individual broadcaster. =Local marketing agreements= If a station sells all of its time to a programmer, essentially leasing the station, it is a local marketing agreement (LMA). Like owning a station, this counts toward United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) caps that prevent excessive concentration of media ownership in the U.S. and Canada. However, in the case of television stations, LMA's do not count towards caps in the U.S. Examples of brokered, non-religious programming ; Financial planning/advice/services *Investors Edge with Gary Kaltbaum *The Mutual Fund Show *The Ray Lucia Show ; Other *The Kevin Trudeau Show ; Music *Ernest Tubb's Midnite Jamboree ; Sports *Calling All Sports With Roc and Manuch See also * Talk radio * Infomercial * Leased access (for cable television) * Advertising Footnotes ","title":"Brokered programming"},{"id":"12856445","text":"Anthurium aristatum is a species of plant in the family Araceae.

Hales was the sixth son of Sir Thomas Hales, 3rd Baronet, a long-serving Member of Parliament who held a series of lucrative posts in the Royal Household. He also held a household post, as Groom of the Bedchamber from 1771 until 1812. In 1774 he stood for election in two constituencies, Canterbury and Downton. At Canterbury he was badly defeated, but Downton was a pocket borough where his brother-in-law Lord Feversham was influential, and he was successful there, though only after petitioning against the original result; he took his seat in February 1775. He later also served as MP for Marlborough. He is not recorded as having spoken in the House in either of his two periods as an MP. His father's baronetcy had passed to his elder brother, Thomas Pym Hales, in 1762. However, when his brother died on 18 March 1773, his only children were daughters, so Philip as the oldest surviving brother inherited the title. He married Elizabeth Smith, pre 1784, but their only child was also a daughter, Elizabeth. On Philip's death in 1824 he had no male heirs, and the baronetcy became extinct.

Also known as Isabel, she was the second daughter of James I of Scotland and Joan Beaufort. Life It was said she was more beautiful than her elder sister Margaret, who married the Dauphin of France, and that John V, Duke of Brittany proposed to marry her; thus he sent ambassadors to Scotland to take a description of her. They reported \\"she was handsome, upright and graceful but she seemed simple too\\". The Duke's reply was \\"My friends, return to Scotland and bring her here, she is all I desire, and I will have no other; your clever women do more harm than good\\". The marriage contract was signed on 19 July 1441 and ratified on 29 September of that year, but Duke John V died on 29 August 1442, before performing the formal religious ceremony. Isabella's coat of arms. Once in Brittany, Isabella married instead with the eldest son of her groom, now Francis I, Duke of Brittany at the Ch√¢teau d'Auray on 30 October 1442, after which the whole court went to Rennes for eight days of festivities. Upon the death of her sister Margaret in 1445, Isabella penned an illuminated prayer book of hours Livre d'Isabeau d'Escosse, which is still in preservation to this day. Like her father she had some reputation as a poet. Upon her husband's death in 1450, there were talks of Isabella's marrying Charles, Prince of Viana, heir to the disputed Kingdom of Navarre, but this proposal fell through due to the disapproval of Charles VII of France. Her brother James II of Scotland made vigorous efforts to persuade her to return to Scotland, where he hoped to arrange a second marriage for her. Isabella however refused, saying that she was happy and popular in Brittany and was in any case too frail to travel, and complaining that her brother had never paid her dowry.MacDougall, Norman James III Revised Edition John Donald Edinburgh 2009 Isabella died ca. 1494/99, which suggests that her claims of ill health 40 years earlier were much exaggerated.
