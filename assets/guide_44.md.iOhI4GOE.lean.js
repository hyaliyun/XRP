History \\"An old railway house on the way to the wharf\\", 1936 The Stella Maris site is located on McMinn Street in Darwin and consists of three main buildings. The oldest building was constructed 1930s by the Commonwealth Railways. While the exact date of its construction is not known, a 1936 map of central Darwin shows two adjacent buildings marked as 'Commonwealth Railways'. The remaining building on site was one of these. The other is thought to have been demolished in the early 1940s. The building may be featured in a photograph dated 1936, entitled ‚Äúan old railway house on the way to the wharf‚Äù although it has not been verified that it is the same building. The fact that the building was described as ‚Äòold‚Äô in 1936 suggests the possibility that it may have been built much earlier. Upon the closure of the North Australia Railway in 1976, many of its buildings were sold or demolished. The site was handed to the City of Darwin Council by the Australian National Railways Commission. It was then leased to Roman Catholic Stella Maris organisation in 1979 to be operated as a licensed club. In 1995 the council recommended that the Stella Maris Hostel be registered as a heritage site. The bid was unsuccessful. The site was re-nominated for heritage listing in 2003. It was accepted on 10 June 2004. At the rear of the site are two other buildings constructed in the 1990s. Neither is considered historically significant. Controversy The site, which is valued at about $3 million, was leased rent-free to Unions NT by the Northern Territory Government on 2 August 2012. This was one day prior to the day the former Labor government entered caretaker mode prior to the 2012 election. In December 2013, the former Northern Territory Lands Minister Gerry McCarthy claimed there was \\"no reasonable prospect of finding any other organisation which was prepared to devote the time and resources to get Stella Maris back to life. Unions NT was the only organisation to take any real interest in the heritage values of the site.\\" It was later revealed that several other organisations had expressed interest in the site, including the National Trust of Australia. An inquiry into the leasing of Stella Maris was opened on 5 December 2013. John Lawler AM APM, the former chief executive officer of the Australian Crime Commission, was appointed as the commissioner of the inquiry. During the 18-day inquiry, McCarthy claimed to have attended a cabinet meeting when the deal was discussed in 2012. Phone records later proved he was in fact in Elliott at the time of the meeting and could not have been present. The final report was tabled in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly on 19 June 2014. The report found the process followed by the then Labor Government was not transparent. It requested Unions NT immediately relinquish any interest in the site and that a formal expression of interest process reopened. It also found the conduct of the then Northern Territory Treasurer Delia Lawrie and McCarthy in relation to the lease was \\"not accountable or responsible\\". Lawrie claimed she had been denied procedural fairness, and took the case to the Northern Territory Supreme Court. Justice Stephen Southwood dismissed her case on 1 April 2015. Attorney-general John Elferink then referred Lawrie to the Northern Territory Police for investigation of \\"possible breaches of the criminal law\\". Lawrie then launched a second appeal, this time into Justice Southwood's decision. In June 2016, Justices John Doyle and Kevin Duggan from South Australia, and Justice Eric Heenan from Western Australia upheld the decision by Justice Southwood that Mr Lawler had conducted the inquiry in a manner that was fair to Lawrie. Current use On 4 March 2016, the Northern Territory Government announced that it had granted a ten-year lease to the National Trust of Australia (Northern Territory) for use of the site as a museum and cafe.

The bridge served as an integral piece of the Ocean to Ocean Highway between Yuma and Phoenix from 1915 to 1922, when it was bypassed by an alternate route through Gila Bend, paralleling the Gillespie Dam. The bridge and original highway were bypassed mainly due to damage caused by flooding along the river floodplain it was constructed on. After being repurposed for traffic traveling north from Yuma, the bridge was finally abandoned in 1929 following completion of the McPhaul Suspension Bridge. The ruins of the old bridge are currently listed on the National Register of Historic Places. History In 1912, Arizona state engineer Lamar Cobb surveyed two different locations to construct an auto bridge over the Gila River. One location was near the town of Dome while the other was located further east along the river at the base of Antelope Hill. Cobb chose the latter as the preferred site for a new bridge. In 1913, engineers working within Cobb's office designed a multiple span concrete girder bridge, with the concrete sections measuring in length. This did not include the length of the approach spans to be constructed of timber trestle structures. The longest single-span would measure long. In total, the new bridge would have 15 separate spans. Guard rails on the bridge would be constructed from steel piping. Cobb opened competitive bidding for the bridge in December 1913. However, the state initially rejected every bid, wishing to use prison labor to construct the bridge instead of contracted labor. The bridge had to be redesigned when Cobb calculated there wasn't an adequate amount of manpower in the Arizona prison system to match the project's size. Having reworked his original plans, Cobb once again opened the project to competitive bidding, awarding the contract to an individual named Parry Borchers in 1914. Construction began in June 1914 but stopped soon afterward due to Borchers defaulting on his loans. Several months later, a winter flood badly damaged the incomplete structure. Borchers' failure to complete the project resulted in the state taking over construction and completing the bridge using prison labor. The Antelope Hill Highway Bridge was finally opened to traffic on August 18, 1915. The event was marked with a celebratory gala picnic attended by thousands of individuals. The bridge was originally part of the main highway between Yuma and Phoenix, known as the Ocean to Ocean Highway. The route also carried several auto trails such as the Dixie Overland Highway, Bankhead Highway and Old Spanish Trail. It was partly rebuilt in 1917-1918 after the 1916 flood washed away the northern approach to the bridge; the modification added five more concrete spans and a wooden trestle. Washouts and destruction of the bridge by flooding were common due to its placement on a weak soil area along the Gila River floodplain. Damage to the bridge came to be expected every time a major flood event occurred on the lower Gila River. Two particularly large floods in November 1919 and February 1920 not only damaged the bridge but completely submerged it as well as washed out a large section of the highway it served. This led to the Arizona Highway Department deciding to construct an entirely different route to bypass the floodplain all together. In 1922, construction of an alternate route through Gila Bend was completed. The new route crossed the Gila River with a concrete apron at the foot of the Gillespie Dam. The apron itself would be replaced five years later by the new Gillespie Dam Bridge. This effectively ended the purpose for which the Antelope Hill Highway Bridge was constructed. The alternate route became the new main highway to Phoenix and was designated as part of U.S. Route 80 in 1926. US 80 would later be replaced by Interstate 8. Despite no longer being the main route between Yuma and Phoenix, the Antelope Hill Highway Bridge was still utilized as the main route for traffic traveling north from Yuma. However, costly flood damage continued, causing the Antelope Hill Highway Bridge to be completely abandoned in 1929. It replaced by the McPhaul Suspension Bridge as the main north‚Äìsouth auto connection from Yuma. The new bridge later became part of U.S. Route 95 before being abandoned itself. Despite total abandonment, the Antelope Hill Highway Bridge has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since June 28, 1979. Where the replacement McPhaul Bridge and Gillespie Dam Bridge are still intact, the years of flood damage and abandonment have left what remains of the Antelope Hill Highway Bridge in ruins. The remains of the Antelope Hill Highway Bridge can be accessed by foot from Roll Road, but are impassible to vehicles. The Antelope Hill Highway Bridge is one of only three surviving twin concrete girder bridges in Arizona, with the other two being the Santa Cruz Bridge and Hell Canyon Bridge.

The episode was written by Sean Calder, and was directed by Peter Werner. Plot Opening quote: \\"And branded upon the beast, the mark of his kin. For none shall live whom they have seen.\\" Nick (David Giuntoli) and Hank (Russell Hornsby) have been investigating the kidnapping of a girl named Donna Reynolds. They have a suspect, Adrian Zayne (Michael Maize). They question him but he panics, woges into a Schakal and attempts to escape but Nick and Hank apprehend him. As they lack evidence, Zayne is released and Nick threatens him as a Grimm. Nick sneaks into his house in an attempt to find evidence and stumbles upon Hank, who was also looking for evidence. They discover Zayne's corpse hanging with symbols marked on his body. The police arrives and Wu (Reggie Lee) tells them that Zayne confessed to the kidnapping and Donna was saved. While the TV makes a report, the symbols cause shock to Monroe (Silas Weir Mitchell) and Bud (Danny Bruno). Monroe explains that the symbols means the Endezeichen Grimms, these Grimms have no heart and kill any Wesen in their path. As Nick is the only known Grimm in Portland, the Wesen will confuse him as the killer. Renard (Sasha Roiz) meets with Juliette (Bitsie Tulloch) to discuss Nick and after it seems that they unintentionally flirt, she leaves. A video showing Zayne's torture before dying is uploaded on internet and the police identify one of the vans belonging to Richard Berna (Michael Patten), a friend of Zayne. They arrest him but he is worried that Nick would kill him, confusing him as the Endezeichen Grimm. He is somehow released and the police raid his house to discover his corpse. He is then taunted by the Endezeichen Grimm on the phone. They find out that Ryan (Michael Grant Terry) let Richard go and he went after Bud. Nick and Hank discover that Ryan has been stalking Nick. Nick and Hank locate Bud in a warehouse while Nick chases Ryan. Ryan confronts him for his methods of interacting and being friends with Wesen. Ryan struggles with control of his Lebensauger side and Nick arrests him. Renard visits Juliette and after some tension, they kiss. Juliette finds out it was he who kissed her in the hospital and they kiss again. Juliette then slams the door in his face, confused.

The A.V. Club's Kevin McFarland gave the episode a \\"B+\\" grade and wrote, \\"When Ryan the intern showed up a few weeks ago, it was unclear exactly what purpose he would serve. His entrance was highlighted to designate him as important, but then he lingered in the background for several weeks, knocking over a water cooler, enduring Sgt. Wu's mockery ‚Äî and if the show had kept up that long con any longer, it would've been frustrating to waste that kind of screen time. But even though I saw the twist coming a few scenes before it happened, I never expected Grimm to take the turn it did, in one deft move revealing Ryan to be a formidable villain for an episode. This is Grimm at its darkest and most in tune with how to blend Nick's responsibilities as a cop with his hidden identity as a Grimm, and even with a handful of quibbles, it makes for a gripping procedural.\\" Emily Rome of EW wrote, \\"Oh, boy, Grimm, way to get so... grim. In what may be the show's darkest episode yet, Nick learns more than he probably wanted to about his ancestry, and things heat up between Juliette and Renard.\\" Nick McHatton from TV Fanatic, gave a 4.0 star rating out of 5, stating: \\"I've had my suspicions about Ryan ever since he mentioned taking an interest in Nick's cases, but I wasn't expecting this. 'The Hour of Death' once again played with Grimms always-present theme of not judging a book by its cover, bringing about some very interesting developments along the way.\\" Shilo Adams from TV Overmind, wrote: \\"I liked all the writing tweaks found here, but I kind of wish that we had spent more time with Ryan and had him become more of a person before pulling a reveal like this.\\" Josie Campbell from TV.com wrote, \\"It was also a relief to find out Intern Ryan's deal, though it would have been nice to spend more time getting to know him as a person, not just a recurring gag, before his big reveal. Imagine if Ryan had been introduced at the beginning of the season, grown into our favorite new Portland PD addition, and then we found out his secret! Still, 'The Hour of Death' created quite the complicated character, one we can't help but pity. Let's cross our fingers for more suicidal Intern Ryan next week (or at least for learning what the heck he is).\\" References External links Grimm (season 2) episodes 2012 American television episodes ","title":"The Hour of Death"},{"id":"51141801","text":"Sharon Fichman and Jovana Jak≈°iƒá were the defending champions, but decided not to participate this year.

The two storey building is constructed from brick and has a corrugated iron roof topped with chimneys that have moulded capping. It has arched windows on both levels with a cantilevered canopy over the surrounding pavement. The hotel was built in 1891 and was the third one built in Albany. Only the Premier and the Albany Hotel still remain. The other, the Railway Hotel, was renamed the Royal George in 1892 and rebuilt in three stories in 1910. The first meeting of the Albany Roads Board was held in the hotel dining room in 1896. Richard R. Burridge acquired the hotel in 1912 - the licensee was Marcus A. O'Grady. Following Burridge's death in 1928, the hotel was auctioned in 1929 and acquired by William Harper for ¬£6,550. Harper was the licensee of the Freemason's hotel located on Stirling Terrace. Harper also outbid the then licensee of the Premier Hotel, Alf Martin. At that time the hotel had 20 bedrooms, a sitting and dining room, offices and two large bar areas. In 1930 the hotel was put on the market again and advertised as having: 26 bedrooms, bars, dining room, commercial rooms, bathrooms, hot water service, and electric light installed and sewered throughout. W.A. Schurer, who had previously owned the London Hotel, acquired the Premier in 1936 and put it up for sale again in 1950. The hotel was gutted by fire in 2016. Four occupants were evacuated from the building and the manager was taken to hospital with non-life threatening injuries. The manager had been assaulted and robbed by two men shortly after midnight. The men lit the fire before leaving the premises. The fire took over four hours to extinguish and gutted most of the interior causing damage in excess of 1 million. The Licensee was later found to have organised the attack in an attempt to claim a $3M dollar insurance payout.

Starring Rajendra Prasad, Suhasini, Kaveri Jha in the lead roles and music composed by E. S. Murthy. The film is remake of Kannada film Eradane Maduve (2011). Plot Venkat (Rajendra Prasad) is an Income Tax officer, who falls victim of being too sincere to his duty. He ends up caught in an embarrassing situation with a lady, caught live on TV by overly enthusiastic media, as a result of which he is suspended from duty. What causes him trouble is not that he lost his job, but that he has lost the trust and respect of his wife Madhavi (Suhasini), and his three daughters. Unable to bear their tantrums, especially of his wife, he schemes a weird plot to re-establish his importance in the family. He brings in Veena (Kaveri Jha) as his girlfriend to make his family members insecure of losing him. What Venkat doesn't know is that his wife will do the same to get back attention from her husband. However, the guy whom she chooses as her acting boyfriend happens to be her elder daughter's real-life boyfriend. It is through this confusing relationship the movie tries to tell the importance of love, respect, family and importantly trust through troubling times.

History Ijora was originally a swampy and water-logged village where residents coming from Lagos Island could reach their homes with the use of canoes. The establishment of a railway terminus at Iddo, a nearby settlement boosted the importance of Ijora. In 1919, the colonial government commissioned a coal wharf at Ijora to unload coal for the use of the Nigerian Railway and the Ijora Thermal Station. In 1923, the government constructed the Ijora Thermal Station to generate electricity for the railway and the environs close to Ijora. In the 1960s, the Lagos State town planning authority and the Federal Government of Nigeria decided to zone tracts of land in the area for industrial use The new zoning led to the draining and further reclamation of land. The industrial estate used to be a base for the firms: K Maroun, Incar cars and West African Cold Storage. The Ijora wharf also functioned as an offloading point for frozen food. Sections of Ijora Other neighborhoods in Ijora include Ijora Oloye, Ijora-Badia and Ijora Olopa. Majority of these places are slums. Alleged members of Boko Haram were arrested at Ijora Oloye in 2013 and in 2016. Ijora- Olopa is a major frozen food market in Lagos. Ajeloro Fish Market in Ijora Coal Wharf is located in this neighborhood. Ijora-Badia is one of Lagos' under-serviced but high density areas. Many early inhabitants of Ijora-Badia are resettlers from Oluwole Village, when the village was acquired by the government for the construction of the National Theatre. Since the resettlement the neighborhood has grown with large number of people living close to the railway tract. Transportation Eko Bridge also known as the second mainland bridge starts from Ijora linking Lagos Island. The Ijora Causeway is a major route to Apapa Wharf. While the Oshodi-Apapa expressway passes through Ijora. The proposed Blue Light Rail Project from Okokomaiko to Marina has a stop close to Ijora.

Cyclosteris curvata is a mostly solitary free living scleractinian disc coral found in the indo-pacific region. They grow on soft substrates and are known to tolerate turbid waters. Like other anthozoan corals they lack a medusa stage characteristic of other cnidarians. They have been observed as both green and brown in color in the field. Description Cylosersis curvata polyp structure is composed of strong arches which can be up to 90 millimeters in diameter. Characteristic of other Anthozoans, they have a large gastrovascular cavity which is divided into walls known as septa, which serve to increase interior surface area. In C. curvata they are generally thick and protrude outward. When viewed from above the septa appear to curve asymmetrically. C. curvata like other cnidarians have nematocysts which are stinging tentacles that contain either a barbed or venomous coiled thread. This can be used in both self defense or to capture prey. = Body plan = Like other Cnidarians, they exhibit an oral-aboral body plan which is characterized by one side containing their mouth and the other without it. Additionally they exhibit radial symmetry meaning their body is symmetrical around a central axis.  Distribution  Cycloseris curvata have been found in depths ranging from 0-30 meters[1]. They are widely distributed through tropical environments ranging from 32¬∞N-31¬∞S. And 32¬∞E-77¬∞W[1].  Life cycle  At the basis of their life cycle, their zygotes become planular planktonic larvae. They continue through a series of metamorphosis forming tentacles, septa, and a pharynx until they ultimately settle as a polyp[2]. Cycloseris curvata have been found to inhabit soft benthic substrates in both inter-reef and reef environments. They can tolerate temperatures ranging from 22¬∞C-27¬∞C  Reproduction  Anthozoans are either gonochoristic or hermaphrodites. Germ cells originate in the endoderm and are eventually moved to the gastrodermis where they will differentiate. Once the germ cells have matured they are released through the coelentron into the sea, as a result reproduction is external. In this process many gametes are produced to increase likelihood of fertilization.[3] They can also reproduce asexually through budding or fragmentation.[2]  Behavior  Individuals feed by extending their tentacles and trapping small zooplankton through a process known as suspension feeding.[4] Larger cnidarians can catch fish and crabs with their nematocysts.[4] Not much is known about their interactions with other species, however they seem to form symbiotic relationships with photosynthetic symbionts.[4]  References  Fungiidae Cnidarians of the Indian Ocean Cnidarians of the Pacific Ocean Marine fauna of Oceania Marine fauna of Southeast Asia Animals described in 1870 ","title":"Cycloseris curvata"},{"id":"51143350","text":"Ellen Mary Rope (1855‚Äì1934) was a British sculptor whose long career stretched from 1885 until the early 1930s. Her work is notable for its range of expression and style, from the classical to the popular. She worked chiefly in bas-reliefs, in stone, cast metal or plaster. Life Born the seventh child of George and Anne Rope of Blaxhall, Suffolk, Ellen Mary Rope is said to have displayed strong artistic leanings as a child, maybe under the influence of her eldest brother, George Thomas Rope, a landscape painter and naturalist. To foster this interest, she was sent to London in 1870 to study at Nottingham Place School in Marylebone, where she was taught drawing by Octavia Hill. She later returned to her home village and attended Ipswich School of Art, taught by among others William T. Griffiths, the principal. Her first exhibited works were paintings and drawings of similar rural subjects to her brother, who exhibited alongside her. She returned to London to the Slade School of Fine Art in 1877, continuing to study drawing and painting but in 1880 Professor Alphonse Legros introduced a course in sculpture and modelling, which Rope followed to good effect, radically influencing the direction of her artistic career. Her art developed along classic Arts and Crafts lines, with emphasis on the artist's involvement throughout the creative process and manual not mechanised production. Rope was based in London for most of her professional career, latterly in Deodar Road, Putney, where she shared accommodation and a studio with her assistant Dorothy Anne Aldrich Rope, a niece. In the same road was the stained-glass studio of another niece M. E. Aldrich Rope, not to be confused with a third artistic niece Margaret Agnes Rope. Ellen Mary Rope only fully retired to the family home at Grove Farm in Blaxhall soon before her death in 1934. Works Her first piece at the Royal Academy of Arts was a terracotta panel: \\"David playing before Saul\\" (1885). From that date she had works at R.A. Exhibitions in most years up until 1918. By 1893 she was sufficiently well known to be commissioned to provide four plaster relief figures for spandrels in the Woman's Building (Chicago) of the World Columbian Exposition in Chicago. Each polychrome panel was nearly six feet tall, and represented Faith, Hope, Charity and Heavenly Wisdom. As well as exhibition pieces, she had a more commercial strand to her art, becoming a leading designer for the Della Robbia Pottery from 1896 until its closure in 1906. This led to more popular domestic works featuring children, flowers and the sea. These small panels \\"were primarily designed to be executed at low cost and repeated if desired, so that they could be used by others than the very rich\\" However, major architectural commissions continued, including large figures of Faith, Hope and Charity for Morley Town Hall, Leeds (since lost), a 20' long panel for Rotherhithe Town Hall (destroyed by wartime bombing), and a memorial executed in cement at St Mary's, Bolton-on-Swale. Her association with the Garrett circle, dating back to childhood, led to her spandrels from Chicago being installed in the dining room of Chenies Street Ladies' Residential Chambers (a project of cousins Rhoda and Agnes Garrett) and later to the marble memorial to the mother of Elizabeth Garrett Anderson in Aldeburgh parish church. Earlier, in 1894, another Garrett associate, Octavia Hill, had commissioned bas-reliefs by Rope for the drawing room of the Women's University Settlement in Nelson Square, Blackfriars.

His books on William Shakespeare, which included Aspects of Shakespearian Tragedy, Shakespearian Comedy and Shakespeare's Historical Plays are reported to be critically acclaimed. He was a professor at the Department of English Language and Literature at Jadavpur University, Calcutta as well as a professor of English literature at Ramakrishna Mission Residential College, an autonomous college under the University of Calcutta. The Government of India awarded him the third highest civilian honour of the Padma Bhushan, in 1983, for his contributions to literature and education.  Biography  Subodh Chandra Sengupta was born in 1903 in Dhaka, in the Bengal Province of British India (present-day Bangladesh) and did his college studies at Presidency College, Calcutta during 1924-26 where he had the opportunity to learn under such academics as Harendra Coomar Mookerjee, Prafulla Chandra Ghosh and Srikumar Banerjee. After securing his MA in 1927, he continued his doctoral studies with Premchand Roychand scholarship during which time he started his career as a faculty member at the Presidency College, Calcutta. He served the institution from 1929 till 1960, barring two interludes from 1933 to 1935 and from 1942 to 1946. In between, he secured his PhD in 1934 and also taught at Ramakrishna Mission Residential College for a while. Sengupta published five books on Shakespeare, The whirlgig of Time: The problem of Duration in Shakespeare's Plays (1961), A Shakespeare Manual (1977), Aspects of Shakespearian Tragedy (1972), Shakespearean Comedy (1950), and Shakespeare's Historical Plays (1964), which are known to be reference texts on the English playwright. He also wrote on other literary figures such as George Bernard Shaw (The Art of Bernard Shaw), Rabindranath Tagore (The Great Sentinel: A Study of Rabindranath Tagore ), Saratchandra Chatterjee (Saratchandra: Man and Artist) and Bankimchandra Chatterjee (Bankimchandra Chatterjee). His other major works included two original books, Towards a Theory of Imagination, a philosophical treatise, India Wrests Freedom, a historical interpretation of Indian freedom movement, and two translations, Dhvanyaloka, a commentary on aesthetics by Anandavardhana translated into Bengali by Sengupta, and Mahatma Gandhi, As I Saw Him, a critical account of the life of Mohandas KaramChand Gandhi written by Prafulla Chandra Ghosh and translated by Sengupta. He also assisted in the publication of a dictionary, Samsad Bengali-English Dictionary and edited the annual publications of Presidency College Alumni Association. Sengupta, who was honored by the Government of India with the civilian award of the Padma Bhushan in 1983, died in 1998, at the age of 95.

Named after Charles Koch, its founder and primary financier, it pursues conservative economic policies and a non-interventionist foreign policy that has been characterized as anti-neoconservative or defensive realist. History The Charles Koch Institute was established in 2011 and is housed in a building which it shares with the Charles Koch Foundation. According to Charles Koch, the institute is the beneficiary of a majority of his personal political donations, or those separate from what originates from Koch Industries. Governance The institute is governed by a board of directors composed of Charles Koch, Chase Koch, Elizabeth Koch, and Richard Fink. Its president is Brian Hooks. Programs =Domestic policy= According to the institute, it funds \\"research that furthers an understanding of how cronyism and corporate welfare affect individual and societal well- being\\". In 2015 the organization partnered with the American Civil Liberties Union to study the implications of newly enacted asset forfeiture legislation in New Mexico. The institute has also developed a Prison Entrepreneurship Program that sponsors business classes and a business plan competition for U.S. prison inmates. =Foreign policy= The institute finances research, forums, and speaking tours regarding U.S. foreign policy, describing its worldview as one that \\"emphasizes the need to defend our territorial integrity from aggression, promote free trade, peacefully engage with the world, and serve as an exemplar of liberal values\\". In 2016 The Intercept described the institute's foreign policy agenda as emblematic of \\"how foreign policy no longer neatly aligns with party politics\\", observing one event the organization hosted that appeared more like \\"a left-wing anti-war rally than a gathering hosted by a longtime right-wing institution\\". The same year it hosted a conference headlined by Chas Freeman, Stephen Walt, and John Mearsheimer. =Professional education= According to the organization, it underwrites several professional education programs, including the \\"Koch Associate Program\\", a fellowship which funds the placement of selected applicants into management positions at partner organizations, which include the Acton Institute, the Regulatory Studies Center at George Washington University, the James Madison Institute, and others.

Its report, published in 1928, was very influential in British locomotive design as it enabled larger multi-cylinder locomotive classes. Background The increased weight of express trains in the United Kingdom during the first quarter of the twentieth century required larger, six-coupled locomotives, but new designs were being limited by the weight restrictions imposed on many underline bridges. On most mainlines this was restricted to no more than on any axle. However, engineers were becoming increasingly aware of the significance of ‚Äòhammer blow‚Äô rather than ‚Äôdeadweight‚Äô in determining the safe loads for such bridges. Committee A committee of was established in 1923, funded jointly by the UK government and the railway companies, to carry out investigations in to the effects of hammer blow on bridges. The committee under chairmanship of the physicist Sir James Alfred Ewing consisted primarily of railway civil engineers, but Sir Henry Fowler, Chief Mechanical Engineer of the London Midland and Scottish Railway was also later invited to join. Among the results was a better understanding of hammer blow and the effects of oscillations in both locomotive springs and bridges. One immediate impact of the investigations was an easing of the axle-load limit for locomotives with both inside and outside cylinders from to .

She was briefly a member of the national parliament (\\"Reichstag\\") in 1932/33. Life =Family provenance and early years= Helene Kirsch was born in the Johannisthal quarter of Berlin. She was one of between seven and nine recorded children born to Hermann Kirsch, variously described as a building worker, an industrial worker and an agricultural worker. His wife was her mother Emilie, many of whose energies were devoted to the family, although she also earned money delivering newspapers and undertaking cleaning work. Hermann Kirsch was a member of the Social Democratic Party who in 1919 switched to the Communist Party, a development which deeply affected his children. Along with Helene Kirsch, four of her siblings became Communist Party officers during the 1920s: Franz Kirsch (1901-1944), (1903-1940), Otto Kirsch and Emilie Kirsch. Helene Kirsch attended junior school locally in Johannisthal and then obtained work as an assembly worker at the Lorenz Telephone Relay Company in Tempelhof. Another of her early jobs was at a cigarette factory. =Weimar years (1919-1933)= When she was 14 Kirsch joined the Young Communists. In 1925, still aged only 19, she joined the Communist Party itself. 1925 was also the year in which she joined a trades union. She also quickly became actively engaged with \\"Red Aid\\" (Rote Hilfe), the Communist Party workers' welfare organisation which was widely seen as having close links with the Soviet Communist Party in Moscow. Throughout this period, at least up till 1932, she was living in Berlin. Kirsch was a member of the party's regional leadership team (Bezirksleitung) for Berlin-Brandenburg, and was a delegate to the party's first and second congresses of working women. In 1931/32 she was employed as a kitchen assistant and server at the Soviet Union's permanent trade mission which was based in Karl Liebknecht House, which was also the national headquarters in Berlin of the German Communist Party. After this she obtained a job as a party instructor within the regional leadership. With political instability mounting, 1932 was a year with two general elections in Germany. The second of them took place in November. Helene Kirsch was elected to the national parliament (\\"Reichstag\\") as a Communist member representing a Berlin electoral district. =Nazi years (1933-1945)= The political context change abruptly in January 1933 when the Nazi Party took power and converted Germany into a one-party dictatorship. At the end of February the Reichstag fire was instantly blamed on the Communists, and in March 1933 Communist members were expelled from the Reichstag which was in any case rendered irrelevant by enabling legislation that allowed the government to rule without parliamentary consent. From March 1933 work for the Communist Party was illegal. In April 1933 the Berlin party leadership, led at this point by Willy S√§gebrecht, sent Helene Kirsch to Cottbus in order to try and sustain the shattered communications between the party teams across the regions, and to support the regional leadership team in Cottbus in doing what was necessary to adapt the party organisation for conditions of illegality. On 24 July 1933 Kirsch was arrested in Cottbus for illegal political activity. She was taken to the local SA premises and beaten with a stick and kicked in order to extract a confession. (Two of her assailants were identified after the end of the war and received long prison sentences.) Charges were laid on 29 November 1933 and on 10 April 1934 she was one of 25 Communists from Berlin, Cottbus and Forst whom the Berlin High Court sentenced. Kirsch was given a prison term of two years and nine months.Walter Hammer/ Walter H√∂sterey: Hohes Haus in Henkers Hand, 1956, S. 41. She was taken to serve her sentence at the Women's Prison in Jauer. In September 1935, following a series of prisoner strikes, she and 45 other prisoners were charged with mutiny (or incitement to mutiny) but charges were dropped for lack of evidence. Kirsch was released from the prison in Jauer on 12 May 1936, but was required to report to a police station on a daily basis for more than a year after that. After her release Kirsch took work in a metal goods factory in Wedding, a quarter of Berlin. She was still working there when the war ended in 1945, albeit not without interruption along the way. Also following her release, she married the print worker Bruno Fredrich (1903-1943). He had been a member of the Communist Party before 1933. However, war resumed in 1939 and he was conscripted into the army. After 1943 he was listed as \\"missing\\". Helene Fredrich was still under police surveillance in 1938: in 1939 she was re-arrested and briefly held in \\"protective custody\\" (\\"Schutzhaft\\"). During the war she stayed in touch with the Communist underground - in effect the Anton Saefkow resistance group - through her friends Ella Trebe and Marta Wagner. This involved missions to get hold of food and money for resistance fighters living illegally in Berlin. =Soviet occupation zone (1945-1949)= War ended in May 1945 and Helene Fredrich, as she was now calling herself, lost no time in signing up to the newly relegimitized Communist Party and in June 1945 she was mandated by the party to organise women's work in the party, with the title \\"District Women's Leader\\" (\\"Kreisfrauenleiterin \\") in Berlin Wedding. Later her regional responsibilities in this post were switched to cover, jointly with Emmi Plinz, the entire Brandenburg region, which involved relocating a short distance, to Potsdam. However, she resigned from this job on health grounds in March 1947. Her successor was . Helene Fredrich returned to Berlin. In April 1946 she was a delegate at the conference which led to the controversial creation of the Socialist Unity Party (Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands / SED). After the war, with what remained of Germany divided into military occupation zones, the central portion of the country, surrounding Berlin, was administered as the Soviet occupation zone. By the time when, in October 1949, the entire zone was relaunched as the Soviet sponsored German Democratic Republic (East Germany), the creation of the SED would be seen as a necessary pre-condition for a return to one-party dictatorship. Following the establishment of the SED, Fredrich was appointed a member of the Brandenburg regional parliament (Landtag), remaining a member till 1950. Regional parliaments were abolished outright two years later as part of a process to streamline and centralise administration and control: while she was a member of it, it appears to have taken up relatively little of her time. =German Democratic Republic (1949-1989)= There is relatively little information on the final decades of her life in the available sources. After 1947 she had a job as a spokesperson in the party central secretariat. She was employed by the important Central Committee of the ruling SED (party) till 1972, working in its \\"West Department\\" which was concerned with the critical but difficult relationship between East and West Germany. =Final years= By the time of her death in 1999, Helene Kirsch-Fredrich had comfortably outlived the German Democratic Republic. Relatively little information exists about her private life. G√ºnter Wehner quotes people who knew her who thought her \\"gregarious and outgoing\\" (\\"gesellige und kontaktfreudige\\"), and also found her \\"energetic and focused\\" (\\"energisch und durchsetzungsf√§hig\\").

The work was jointly commissioned by the Tonhalle Orchester Z√ºrich, the Swedish Radio Symphony Orchestra, the New York Philharmonic with support from the philanthropist Marie-Jos√©e Kravis, the Bamberg Symphony, and the Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra. It was first performed by the Tonhalle Orchester Z√ºrich and the Z√ºrcher Sing-Akademie conducted by Lionel Bringuier in the Tonhalle, Z√ºrich, on September 10, 2014. The piece is set to the eponymous poem by the German author and Dadaist Hugo Ball. Composition Karawane has a duration of approximately 28 minutes and is composed in two numbered parts. Each part is subdivided into six connected and unnamed movements. =Background= Karawane was composed between January 2013 and July 2014. Salonen had long intended to write a piece for chorus and orchestra, but delayed its composition due to scheduling conflicts and a lack of appropriate text. The opportunity finally arose when Salonen received a commission from a consortium of international orchestras. Knowing the premiere would be held in Z√ºrich, the composer decided to connect his piece to the city's history, particularly the origins of Dadaism in 1916. Salonen wrote in the score program notes, \\"Soon I settled for perhaps the best known Dada poem (or 'Lautpoesie', 'Sound Poetry' as it was called) by Hugo Ball, the founder of Dada, author of the Dada Manifesto, and the central figure in all the activities of Cabaret Voltaire, the first forum of the early dadaists.\\" =Instrumentation= The work is scored for an SATB chorus and a large orchestra consisting of three flutes (2nd doubling alto flute; 3rd doubling piccolo), two oboes, English horn, two clarinets, bass clarinet (doubling 3rd clarinet), contrabass clarinet, two bassoons, contrabassoon, four horns, three trumpets (3rd doubling piccolo trumpet), three trombones, tuba, timpani, four percussionists, harp, piano (doubling celesta), and strings. Reception Karawane has been praised by music critics. Reviewing the world premiere, Mark Swed of the Los Angeles Times called it \\"a mischievous, madcap 30-minute work for orchestra\\" and wrote, \\"Karawane channels Salonen's inner caveman (who knew?), treating the text of made-up words (the opening is: 'jolifant bambla o falli bambla') as a springboard for a circus of styles and emotions. Written in a double cycle, the second part intensifying the first, the score propels from one entrancing dreamlike state to another, from one extreme (nocturnal quiescence) to another (a wild Javanese monkey chant).\\" After hearing a later performance by Los Angeles Philharmonic, Swed called it \\"richer, lusher, livelier and all the more unhesitatingly in-your-face.\\" Reviewing a performance of the work by the New York Philharmonic, Zachary Woolfe of The New York Times described it as \\"the product of a mature master, working with more confidence and patience on a larger canvas. The chorus‚Äôs hypnotic incantations have the undergirding of a glistening orchestral landscape, sometimes swaying, sometimes blooming.\\" He continued: Jay Nordlinger of The New Criterion was slightly more critical of the piece, however, remarking, \\"I found Karawane a bit tiresome. But perhaps the problem was my lack of patience, rather than a lack of imagination on the composer's part. In a program note of his own, Gilbert called Salonen's work 'deliciously whimsical while also being fully formed and rigorous.' I'll buy that. And I'll definitely buy Salonen, who is a credit to this musical age.\\" Despite calling it \\"entertaining and grandiose,\\" George Grella of the New York Classical Review similarly observed that the \\"narrative feel of Karawane loses out to density over a 30-minute duration.\\" He added, \\"There are entertaining, colorful bits of music that seem inspired by other composers, like Ennio Morricone, Philip Glass, and John Adams. In particular, sections seem like responses to Harmonium. Salonen embraces clich√©s with a knowing wink, but they add bigness to a piece that is already overblown.\\" References Compositions by Esa-Pekka Salonen 2014 compositions Choral compositions Compositions for symphony orchestra Music commissioned by the New York Philharmonic Music commissioned by the Swedish Radio Symphony Orchestra ","title":"Karawane"},{"id":"51143988","text":"Lieutenant colonel Claude Evelyn Bowden (11 October 1897 ‚Äì 9 October 1984) was a British military officer, RFC pilot and one of the most well-known aeromodellers in the 1920s to 1950s.

Ravaschieri served as a noted preacher and confessor and befriended as contemporaries Blessed Bernardine of Feltre and architect Giovanni Antonio Amadeo. Ravaschieri's beatification received confirmation - on 8 January 1930 - after Pope Pius XI issued a decree that acknowledged his 'cultus' (or popular devotion and following). Life Baldassare Ravaschieri was born in the Republic of Genoa in 1420 to nobles whose ancestors were the counts of Lavagna; his father was Count Cattaneo (d. 1421). His aunts Ginerva and Tobia - both Franciscan tertiaries - were responsible for his religious upbringing. He entered the convent of the Order of Friars Minor not too far from his home in Genoa where he became noted for being a good theologian and a model religious while also acting as a zealous confessor. He was also known for his practice of mortifications. Ravaschieri also served as the order's superior and later its vicar provincial. His studies for the priesthood were conducted at Santa Maria del Campo (where he earned his doctorate in theological studies) before he was ordained as a priest. Ravaschieri also suffered from gout which limited his movements and required him to sometimes be carried to Mass. Ravaschieri also served as a preacher alongside Bernardine of Feltre. He was a friend of the architect Giovanni Antonio Amadeo and the confessor of Veronica of Milan. It was once said that on one winter night he had remained in the woods where it was snowing though the spot he was sitting in was without snow. He died on 17 October 1492. His relics were transferred to Pavia in 1805. Beatification The Diocese of Pavia initiated the cause for beatification that later resulted in the recognition of his 'cultus' (or popular following) which allowed for Pope Pius XI - on 8 January 1930 - to confirm his beatification.

Early life  Fields was born Anthony Dean Campos in Stafford, Kansas. After his parents separated when he was four, his mother remarried, and he took his stepfather's last name, Fields. He was raised in Davis, California and showed an early aptitude for gymnastics before taking up dance training. He attended Davis High School, graduating in 1977. Fields then went on to college at the Pacific Conservatory of the Performing Arts on scholarship and Roland Dupree Academy of Dance, but left when paid work began to materialize for him.  Work on film and television  He moved to Hollywood to pursue his career, and started performing as a backup dancer in Debbie Reynolds' nightclub act. He then found a job on the Solid Gold television series as a dancer in 1979. Fields would continue with Solid Gold until 1985. During this time period, he also performed in the music video for Queen's \\"Body Language\\", at Freddie Mercury's direct request. In 1983, Fields performed in Michael Jackson's \\"Beat It\\" and \\"Thriller\\" music video, both choreographed by Michael Peters, and Lionel Richie's \\"Running with the night\\" music video. Richard Attenborough was working on a film version of the Broadway musical A Chorus Line in 1984. After a casting call which attracted over 3000 people, and auditions by anyone who had previously performed in the musical, Tony Fields won the role of Al DeLuca. Fields' film work continued, with roles in Trick or Treat (1986), Body Beat (1987), The Doctor (1991) and Across the Moon (1995) and television shows such as Murder She Wrote (1992), L.A. Law (1991) and Monsters (1990). He also performed in plays and musical theatre in California. He gradually became ill, and no longer able to sustain the physical demands of dancing, he returned to Davis High School to mentor students in 1994. Fields died of HIV-related cancer in 1995.  Legacy  Fields is honored each year at Davis Senior High School with the showcase ‚ÄúA Tribute to Tony Fields‚Äù , celebrating the arts program of the school. He was inducted into the high school's Hall of Fame in 2009, and a scholarship is also available in his name.

At least 97 people were killed and 260 injured. The terrorist group Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant has claimed responsibility, however, the same group later on refused it. Some Hazara protestors allege that Afghan president Ashraf Ghani was behind the attack. They believe that Ashraf Ghani government was abetting the terrorists who were responsible for the attack. They also allege that the government officials were preventing the wounded from being shifted to the hospital. The attack was the deadliest in Kabul since 2001 but was surpassed by a truck bombing in May 2017. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, in a live television address, declared the following day (24 July) a day of national mourning and promised action against the culprits. In tribute to the victims, Ghani renamed the Dehmazang Square, where the attack took place, to the Enlightenment Martyrs' Square. Background The Hazaras are the third largest ethnic group of Afghanistan, mostly Shia, forming between 19-25% of the Afghan population, which is mostly Sunni. Hazaras have been subject to discrimination and genocides since the establishment of the current Afghan state by Emir Abdur Rahman Khan in 1919. The Hazara community has long been persecuted by the Taliban, who came to power in 1996, overall resulting in thousands killed. The TUTAP (Turkmenistan-Uzbekistan-Tajikistan-Afghanistan- Pakistan) is a multimillion-dollar power project backed by the Asian Development Bank and World Bank to make electricity accessible to more people in Afghanistan. The project's initial assessment recommended the TUTAP route through the Bamyan Province, a Hazara populated province in the Central Highlands, but in 2016 the government of Afghanistan re-routed it via Salang Pass. The Hazara of Afghanistan protested against the decision to re-route the TUTAP project. The community believed that the decision to re-route was politically motivated and its objective was to bypass some of the most underdeveloped areas which were predominantly occupied by Hazara communities. The civil activists of Kabul organised a march to protest on 6 May 2016, naming the movement ÿ¨ŸÜÿ®ÿ¥ ÿ±Ÿàÿ¥ŸÜÿß€å€å (literally \\"Enlightenment Movement\\"). Subsequent negotiations between the protesters and government officials were inconclusive. Therefore, a second peaceful demonstration was organised on 23 July 2016. Thousands of people attended the demonstration on 23 July 2016. It started west of Kabul at around 07:00 and ended at Deh Mazang Square, where the government had placed containers and trucks to stop demonstrators from marching towards the presidential palace. Protesters were planning to make camp here at the end of the protest. Before the march, the government had warned organizers of the possibility of an attack. The government had also blocked the route of the protestors by placing Shipping containers. The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) is a Syria-based terror group who have committed various attacks against civilians on the Eurasian continent. ISIL's Afghanistan branch is small, based in the country's east near the Pakistani border. In March 2016, Afghan president Ashraf Ghani claimed that the group was 'wiped out of Afghanistan', after the group failed to expand and pose a serious threat to the government. Bombings At 14:30, two militants detonated explosive belts when protesters were returning home at the end of the demonstrations. Security agencies claim they had intelligence reports warning about movement of bombers. CNN reported, citing Afghan police, that a third attacker was killed before detonating his bomb, though only two attackers were described in the claim of responsibility. Reactions =Supranational bodies= * ‚Äì Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and Tadamichi Yamamoto, Special Representative of Secretary-General for Afghanistan and the head of the UN Assistance Mission for Afghanistan (UNAMA) condemned the terror attack on a peaceful demonstration in Kabul, describing the attack a \\"despicable crime\\". * - President of the 70th session of the General Assembly Mogens Lykketoft also expressed shock at the killings and said that Afghanistan continued to struggle with the very grave consequences of the civil war and violent extremism. =Countries= * ‚Äì Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif condemned the attack and expressed condolences to the Afghan government and people. * ‚Äì Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif strongly condemned the attack in Kabul and expressed deep grief over loss of human lives and reiterated solidarity with the government and people of Afghanistan. * ‚Äì President Pranab Mukherjee condemned the perpetrators of the incident and extended condolences to the families whose beloved lost their lives in twin blasts and prayed for recovery of people wounded. * ‚Äì Foreign Ministry strongly condemned that terrorist attack and wished God's mercy on those who lost their lives. * ‚Äì White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest stated that United States \\"in the strongest terms\\" condemned the attack in Kabul, because it targeted people at a peaceful demonstration. =Domestic= *The Taliban, the predominant anti-government group in Afghanistan, denied any involvement in the attack and in a statement posted on their website termed the attack \\"a plot to ignite civil war\\". In a rare expression, the Taliban joined the Afghan government in condemning the attack. Aftermath =United Nations special report on the attack= On 18 October 2016, the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) issued a special human rights report \\"Attack on a Peaceful Demonstration in Kabul, 23 July 2016\\" following months of its investigation into the attack. In the report, the Mission concluded that the attack on the peaceful demonstration not only deliberately targeted civilians but also was a serious violation of international humanitarian law, which may amount to a war crime. The report reviewed the context of the demonstration, the planning and preparedness of Afghan Security Forces, their behaviour during the demonstration and immediate response to the attack and its aftermath. It also raised, where relevant, human rights concerns for authorities. The report also offered recommendations on the respect for fundamental human rights of all Afghans, including the rights of religious and ethnic communities, as well as the need for the completion and implement of a strategy to prevent violent extremism.

History The hermitage was constructed in the beginning of the 18th century for a private landowner and built alongside his residential home (but concluded before the manor house). The first pastoral visit to the hermitage occurred in 1707. In the will and testament of vicar Jo√£o Pacheco Raposo (dated 6 June 1715), the former prelate referred to the hermitage as a producer of two alqueires of land. This vicar had purchased three-quarters of land and some lands with watermills, and left them to the company of St. James, with the obligation to pay eleven alqueires of wheat yearly for the Holy Sacrament of the town. In 1871, the hermitage was transferred from the property owners, and became a building of the Junta de Par√≥quia (parish junta). The hermitage began to operate as the funerary chapel for the parish council of √Ågua de Pau in 1986 and was remodelled sometime in the 20th century. As part of its transformation, a project to reformulate the Largo de Santiago was begun in 1996, and inaugurated on 20 September 2003. Architecture The hermitage is situated on the northern edge of the settlement, in an ample square, alongside the parish council building of √Ågua de Pau and the Casa do Povo. It is encircled by steps and pavement stone and linked transversally by the lateral house. The rectangular plan consists of a single nave and presbytery with an addorsed lateral left rectangular sacristy. The facades are plastered and painted white with the main facade (oriented to the south) flanked by pilasters and cornerstones surmounted by pinnacles. This facade is terminated with cornices and surmounted by a latin cross over a cylindrical stand. The entrance is marked by a doorway decorated with cornices and rectangular window protected by wood grade, while the rear is blind. The interior walls are plastered and painted in white, while the floors and ceiling are built in wood. The lateral door is flanked by a hemispherical baptismal pia and wardrobe, while at the top of the nave (behind the pulpit) is the door to the sacristy. A triumphal arch supported by pilasters supports the vaulted structure over wood cornices in the presbytery, dominated by a floor-size wooden crucifix and altar.

During the WPA's era, she painted murals in civic buildings, including murals in the library in Cambridge, Massachusetts; the fire and police building of Saugus, Massachusetts; the Milton, Massachusetts post office; Medford, Massachusetts City Hall; the post office of Downers Grove, Illinois; and the post office in Kennebunkport, Maine, as well as others both in the U.S. and abroad. She was an art instructor at the University of Missouri and the American University of Beirut, continuing her own painting projects simultaneously with her teaching into the 1980s. Upon her death, she established a trust to create the Montminy Art Gallery in Columbia, Missouri. Early life Elizabeth Tracy was born on June 5, 1911 in Boston, Massachusetts. She began painting and drawing images for stories as a child and initially wanted to illustrate fashion designs. Her early education was in Cambridge, Massachusetts and her studies continued at Radcliffe College. Graduating with honors in Fine Arts in 1933, Tracy studied with the Italian painter Rico Lebrun at the Art Students League of New York between 1934 and 1935. Career In 1934, Tracy began working for the Works Project Administration (WPA) through the Section of Painting and Sculpture (later called the Section of Fine Arts). Murals in public buildings were intended to boost the morale of the American people from the effects of the Depression by depicting uplifting subjects. Murals were commissioned through competitions open to all artists in the United States. She initially worked as an assistant to other artists, working on the murals in the public library in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The Cambridge library project included four murals, which Tracy completed with Arthur Willis Oakman. Tracy's first solo commission was a mural for the fire and police building of Saugus, Massachusetts. She began work on The Founding of Saugus in 1935 in the courthouse of the police station. The mural depicted the early meeting of Native Americans and the English settlers who founded the town. When the police station was demolished, the mural was moved to the auditorium of the Saugus Town Hall. After completion of the Saugus mural, it is likely that she completed the mural for the Salinas y Rocha y Cia department store in Mexico City, since it was completed prior to her application for the Guggenheim Fellowship in 1939. Tracy was selected to paint the mural for the Milton, Massachusetts post office. The painting, The Suffolk Resolves: Oppression and Revolt in the Colonies adorns a wall in the office of the post service manager. Completed in 1938, it was restored by a conservator from Chicago in 2010, after storm damage to the post office. Following the project in Milton, Tracy began work on a mural at the Medford City Hall in Medford, Massachusetts. Her mural, located on the second floor in what is now the solicitor's office, was called Terror of the Wilderness. The mural's theme depicts the trials colonists faced with images on the left representing plague victims and on the right showing nude natives attacking settlers. Completed in 1939, the nudity caused controversy when unveiled and it was discussed whether it should be painted over or preserved. After completion of the mural, Tracy was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship to run from September 1, 1940 for one year. Tracy's next project was Chicago: Railroad Centre of the Nation in the post office of Downers Grove, Illinois. The work is large, 6 feet x 13 feet and illustrates workers constructing the railroads and preparing to load mail onto boxcars at the train station. It was completed in 1940 and was designated by the Downers Grove Historical Society as a historical site in 2004. After completing the Illinois project, Tracy married Edmond Pierre Montminy (1907-1972) in 1941. By July of that year, she was working on a painting titled The Bathers, for the post office in Kennebunkport, Maine, which centered on beach-goers and colorful umbrellas. As soon as she started painting, objections to the modernist style and subject matter surfaced from numerous prominent local citizens. A barrage of letters went back and forth between Washington, D. C. bureaucrats and Tracy, as well as the postmaster. Though she completed the mural, the citizens of Kennbunkport, led by Kenneth Roberts and Booth Tarkington, took up collection and raised enough funds to buy a replacement mural painted by Gordon Grant. The United States Senate agreed in March, 1945 to replace Tracy's mural at the post office, with Grant's. By the time she heard of the Senate's decision, her mural had been replaced and she and Pierre, who was working at the University of Texas at Austin, realized there was nothing they could do. Elizabeth Tracy legally changed her name to Tracy Montminy and in 1948, was hired at the University of Missouri (MU) to work on the faculty of the Art Department. She initially taught painting and drawing, but in 1976, a proposal to teach mural painting was approved. In the early 1960s, Montminy taught briefly at the American University of Beirut, returning to teach at MU afterward. Her last two murals were painted in 1977 for the Boone National Savings and Loan Association. Montminy continued teaching until 1981, and in 1990, made arrangements for her estate to fund the Montminy Gallery, which is currently maintained through a trust. Montminy died in 1992 and left her estate to the Boone County Historical Society (BCHS), in Columbia, Missouri. Posthumously, an exhibit entitled Painted Walls was hosted in March 2006 by the BCHS. A celebration in honor of Montiminy's 100th birthday, was held in 2011. Gallery The Montminy Art Gallery came to fruition on June 19, 1993, after Tracy Montminy's death. She bequeathed an endowment to the Boone County Historical Society to enable the BCHS to build a gallery to care for the couples works (murals, oil paintings, pen and ink drawings and sketches) as well as works of other artists from the surrounding area. Montminy's husband, Pierre had been an artist and served as chair of the art department at Stephens College prior to his death. The Montminy Gallery opened on April 24, 1994 and is open Wednesday through Sundays with free admission. When the museum was opened, the last two murals Montminy painted were moved to flank the entryway of the gallery.

It is intended that the Type 31 frigate will replace some of the Type 23 frigates. The Type 31 is part of the British government's \\"National Shipbuilding Strategy\\". Development The Type 31 frigate came out of the 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review. The review authorised a replacement programme, known as the Global Combat Ship (GCS), to replace the Royal Navy's thirteen Type 23 frigates. Earlier that year, BAE SystemsThe Defence Industrial Strategy white paper in 2005 had encouraged BAE Systems to form a joint venture with VT Group (\\"Vosper Thornycroft\\") - which would be guaranteed 15 years of work (or financial compensation), thereby maintaining shipbuilding skills and capacity in the UK. BAE Systems Surface Ships brought together BAE shipbuilding operations on the Clyde with the Vosper Thornycroft operations at Portsmouth dockyard was awarded a four-year, ¬£127 million contract by the Ministry of Defence to design the new class. It was planned that two variants of the class would be built: five general purpose frigates and eight anti-submarine warfare frigates. There was to be little difference between the two variants, except for the Sonar 2087. Initial expectations were that all thirteen of the Global Combat Ships would be built starting in 2016, and gradually replace the Type 23 frigates one for one out to the mid-2030s. The 2015 Strategic Defence and Security Review decided that only eight anti- submarine warfare Type 26 frigates, would be ordered. Five general purpose frigates to a different design altogether would be ordered to give at least 13 frigates in RN service.National Security Strategy and Strategic Defence and Security Review 2015, www.gov.uk =General Purpose Frigate= The resultant General Purpose Frigate (GPFF) was a new class intended to be a lighter, flexible and more affordable general purpose frigate. According to the 2015 defence review, the lower cost of these frigates could lead to the Royal Navy acquiring more than five of them, thus increasing its overall numbers of frigates and destroyers. During a defence and security lecture in July 2016, GPFF was referred to as the Type 31 frigate by the First Sea Lord Admiral Sir Philip Jones. Admiral Jones further stated that Type 31 frigates could permanently operate East of Suez; from the Persian Gulf region to the Asia- Pacific. During the same month, BAE Systems revealed two general purpose frigate designs, namely the Avenger class which was based on the \\"Amazonas- class/River-class Batch 2 offshore patrol vessel\\" and the Cutlass class that was described as a \\"significantly stretched and enhanced derivation of the Al Shamikh-class corvette design\\". An August news article in The Sunday Times stated that Babcock International and BMT also submitted one design each. =National Shipbuilding Strategy= In October 2017 The Financial Times stated that \\"..officials inside the Ministry of Defence, the Treasury and Royal Navy have long resented the obligation, set a decade ago, to maintain skills and shipbuilding capacity at BAE‚Äôs shipyards on the Clyde regardless of naval needs.\\" It quoted Francis Tusa, a defence analyst, who argued that the competition appeared to be designed to break BAE's hold on naval shipbuilding; ‚ÄúWere they to have bid as BAE Systems, they wouldn‚Äôt win. That is absolutely obvious. The fact is that the Type 31 is slanted probably to exclude any bid that includes BAE.‚Äù However this was denied by the MoD which stated that the competition is designed to improve speed of delivery and reduce cost. In order to maintain national shipbuilding capacity, the 2017 national shipbuilding strategy proposes ordering an initial batch of five Type 31e Frigates with an initial in-service date in 2023, intended for export with their cost limited to a maximum ¬£250m each, to be followed by a second batch order of Type 31 for the Royal Navy. The Type 31 is projected to be built in modular form as with the carriers at several commercial shipyards, and assembled in one central yard. =Design tenders= Throughout 2017 several designs from different companies were suggested as contenders for the Type 31. BAE submitted two designs, \\"Avenger\\", essentially an improved Batch 3 River-class OPV, and \\"Cutlass\\", a significantly stretched and enhanced derivation of the Al Shamikh-class corvette.BMT submitted a design called \\"Venator 110\\", with Steller Systems putting forward project \\"Spartan\\" and Babcock offered a design named \\"Arrowhead 120\\". In October 2017, BAE Systems announced its intention to withdraw from the Type 31e competition as a main contractor, citing the capacity constraints of its shipyards on the Clyde, which are full with the work on the new s and Type 26 frigates. Instead, BAE announced a partnership with Cammell Laird, whereby BAE would provide its expertise in design and systems integration, while Cammell Laird would be the prime contractor and be responsible for the assembly of the ships at its yard at Birkenhead. The planned design has been named \\"Leander\\", a reference to three previous classes of ship in the Royal Navy. In November 2017, it was announced that BMT and Babcock signed a co-operation agreement for the Type 31. They did not choose between their respective \\"Venator 110\\" or \\"Arrowhead 120\\" designs, but instead would explore their designs to determine the best possible option. In late May 2018, Babcock, partnered with BMT and Thales Group announced the \\"Arrowhead 140\\" design, based on the hull of the Danish s. The competition was suspended on 20 July 2018 due to ‚Äòinsufficient compliant bids‚Äô being received, however The Times claimed this was due to a \\"funding crisis\\". However the competition was restarted in August 2018. =Competitive Design Phase selection= On 10 December 2018, three groups were selected for the competitive design phase: * BAE Systems/Cammell Laird with their planned Leander design * Babcock/BMT/Thales with their Arrowhead 140 design * Atlas Elektronik UK/Thyssenkrup Marine Systems, which was likely to be based on the MEKO A-200 design Both the BAE Systems and Babcock led entrants had already been put forward when the competition was temporarily suspended. The third bid, led by Atlas Elektronik UK, was likely to use the MEKO A-200 platform as its basis, currently in use with the Algerian and South African Navies. Both the Babcock and Atlas proposals included Ferguson Marine on the Clyde and Harland & Wolff in Belfast. By August 2019 both Ferguson Marine and Harland & Wolff had announced that they were in financial difficulties.

File:Arrowhead-concept-for-Type-31e-Frigate.jpgThe 'Arrowhead 140' concept by Babcock and BMT for the Type 31e frigate class. It is based heavily on the Iver Huitfeldt-class frigates for the Royal Danish Navy, previously built by Odense Shipyard in 2008. File:Spioenkop F147.jpg, a MEKO A-200 similar to the planned Atlas Elektronik design It was announced on 12 September 2019 that the Arrowhead 140 design had been selected for the Type 31 Frigate. A contract was formally awarded to Babcock Group on 15 November 2019, for an average production cost of ¬£250 million per ship and an overall program cost set to be ¬£2 billion with ¬£1.25 billion value to prime contractor Babcock. On 20 January 2020, the Public Accounts Committee was informed by the Permanent Secretary for Defence that the first ship will be in the water by 2023 but the in-service date will be in 2027. This is in contrast to earlier statements that the in-service date would be in 2023. Characteristics During a July 2016 Defence Select Committee hearing, First Sea Lord Admiral Sir Philip Jones described the GPFF as \\"to be a much less high-end ship. It is still a complex warship, and it is still able to protect and defend and to exert influence around the world, but it is deliberately shaped with lessons from wider industry and off-the-shelf technology to make it... more appealing to operate at a slightly lower end of Royal Navy operations.\\" IHS Janes described it as a \\"credible frigate\\" that will cover \\"maritime security, maritime counter-terrorism and counter-piracy operations, escort duties, and naval fire support... [sitting] between the high-end capability delivered by the Type 26 and Type 45, and the constabulary-oriented outputs to be delivered by the five planned River-class Batch 2 OPVs.\\" A September 2017 graphic released by the Royal Navy stressed modular adaptability and flexible construction of the design for export opportunities. Core requirements of the Type 31e frigate include a medium calibre gun, point defence systems, hangar and a flight deck for Wildcat or ten tonne helicopter operated by a crew of around 100 with space for 40 more personnel. The British government released a Request for information (RFI) in September 2017, detailing the desired characteristics of the Type 31e. The RFI provides greater details such as a \\"Medium Calibre Gun\\" of greater than , a point defence anti-air missile system and the optional ability to launch and recover unmanned aerial vehicles. Forces News reported that the design will contain Sea Ceptor missiles, an advanced air and surface surveillance and target indication radar such as the Thales NS100 and be able to operate either an AgustaWestland Wildcat HMA2 or an AgustaWestland Merlin HM2. On 1 October 2020, BAE Systems announce it was under contract to supply five Bofors 57 Mk3 medium caliber guns and ten Bofors 40 Mk4 small caliber guns to the Royal Navy for the first five Type 31 frigates. The exact configuration will be adequate but adaptable and the ships may form as part of the Queen Elizabeth-class carrier strike group.

On a long leave, in January 1876, Floyer started for the unexplored interior of what is now Sistan and Baluchestan Province, in Iran. He travelled there him until May 1877, and earned himself a reputation as an explorer. In January 1878 he was appointed inspector-general of Egyptian telegraphs, a post which he held for the rest of his life. He turned round the finances of the department, and induced the government to devote a part of its surplus to experiments on the cultivation of trees and plants in the desert. He cultivated successfully cactus for fibre, casuarina for telegraph poles, Hyoscyamus muticus yielding the alkaloid hyoscyamine, and other plants. Having discovered sodium nitrate in a clay in Upper Egypt, he was appointed by the government to superintend the process of its extraction. In 1884 Floyer made a journey in the Sudan, from Wadi Halfa to Al Dabbah; and in 1887 surveyed two routes between the River Nile and the Red Sea at about latitude 26¬∞. In 1891 he was appointed by the Khedive of Egypt to the command of an expedition in a more southerly part of the same desert (about latitude 24¬∞). On this expedition he rediscovered the abandoned Sikait-Zubara emerald mines, which were then reopened. For services to the military authorities Floyer received the Egypt Medal with clasp, and the Khedive's Star. He had mastered of Arabic including dialects. He died at Cairo on 1 December 1903. Works Unexplored Baluchistan (1882) describes: Floyer's journey of exploration from Jask to Bampur; a tour in the Persian Gulf; and a journey of exploration from Jask to Kerman via Angohran. There are appendices on dialects of Western Baluchistan and on plants collected. Floyer described his Egyptian explorations in: The Mines of the Northern Etbai;Transactions Royal Asiatic Society October 1892 Notes on the Geology of the Northern Etbai;Transactions Geological Society, 1892, vol. xlviii Further Routes in the Eastern Desert of Egypt;Geographical Journal, May 1893 and Journeys in the Eastern Desert of Egypt.Proceedings Royal Geographical Society 1884 and 1887 His official publication was √âtude sur la Nord-Etbai entre le Nil and la Mer Rouge (Cairo, 1893). He contributed papers on antiquarian, botanical, and agricultural matters to the Journal of the Institut Egyptien for 1894‚Äì6. Family Floyer married in 1887 Mary Louisa, eldest daughter of the Rev. William Richards Watson, rector of Saltfleetby St. Peter, Lincolnshire. They had three sons.

Biography  Intended for the service of the Church, he indeed became abbot, but quickly turned away, fascinated by the life of Paris. Passionate about theater, he began writing for the fair troupe of Jean-Baptiste Nicolet. His first play, La Bourbonnaise (1768), was highly applauded, to the point that Nicolet hired him to replace Toussaint-Gaspard Taconet. He wrote up to three plays a week, under the name Abb√© Robineau, and earned 18 pounds per play. In 1777, he had his L'Amour qu√™teur presented, little play quite scandalous but an immediate success. The Archbishop of Paris made Robineau disrobed, who immediately took the pseudonym Beaunoir, anagram of his name. Beaunoir served Nicolet until 1780, then composed more ambitious plays which were given at the Th√©√¢tre des Vari√©t√©s-Amusantes and the Com√©die Italienne. Around 1770, he had become King Louis XV's librarian, but his reputation as a libertine author undermined the dignity of his colleagues who demanded in 1783 that he write anonymously. For some years, it is his wife, Louise-C√©line Cheval (1766-1821), who signed his works under the name Mme de Beaunoir. En 1788, Beaunoir left Paris to become theatre director of the Grand Th√©√¢tre de Bordeaux. One year later, a disastrous management ended with a resounding bankruptcy which pushed him out of France and he emigrated in Brussels. In the midst of the Brabant Revolution, he did not hesitate to break into the two parties, sometimes flattering Vonck, sometimes van der Noot. Disgusted with his theatrical setbacks, he began composing brochures and pamphlets, writing papers. Repudiated by van der Noot, he wrote his \\"historical drama\\" Histoire secr√®te et anecdotique de l'Insurrection belgique, ou Vander-Noot (1790), scandalous pamphlet in which he denounced the failures of revolutionaries. In search for a shelter from the wrath of the tyrant he described, Beaunoir fled to Holland where he wrote another satire, Les Masques arrach√©s which rapidly spread in Belgium and lead to the fall of van der Noot. Leaving the Netherlands, Beaunoir went to Neuwied and joined a colony of French men of letters, including Louis-Fran√ßois Metra who had him collaborate to his '. In 1791, after spending some months in Li√®ge where he wrote L'Ami des hommes ou le Vengeur, Beaunoir reconciled with theatre and started writing plays for the Th√©√¢tre de la Monnaie in Bruxelles where he gave Le Grand d√©nouement de la constitution (1791), Le Commissionnaire et le jockey (1792), La Nouvelle dibutade (1793), L'Hommage de Bruxelles (1793), Le Bouquet (1793), La S√©paration (1794) and Le M√©decin et l'apothicaire (1794). In 1796, Beaunoir was in St-Petersburg where he directed the theaters of the court, but was banished at the end of the year with all the other French. He then spent several years in Berlin, waiting for the right moment to return to France. He eventually returned January 1, 1800, but found neither his friends and protectors, nor his public nor his place among the French society of the French Consulate.

It is considered one of the best heroic poetry of Old Gujarati which is mixed with Avahatatha, the artificial literary speech of court poets. He may have personally witnessed the battle. It is also historical work as its veracity can be verified by contemporary Muslim chronicles. The poem starts with ten Sanskrit verses followed by 60 Gujarati verses full of words of Persian and Arabic origin. It employs words with consonants to produce heroic feelings.

Located in the town cemetery of Dunkirk, France, the design by Commission architect Philip Hepworth features memorial panels, a shrine in the form of a shelter, and an engraved glass pane by John Hutton. Those commemorated include soldiers lost on ships sunk during the evacuation, as well as a recipient of the Victoria Cross. The memorial was completed some 17 years after the events it marks. It was unveiled by Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother in 1957, in front of visiting dignitaries, and hundreds of veterans and relatives of those who died. Later commemorations held here include the 75th anniversary in 2015. Background The Battle of Dunkirk consisted of the defence of and evacuation of Allied forces from Dunkirk, resisting and evading capture by the invading German forces. The battle was part of the larger Battle of France campaign during the Second World War, with the British Army forces consisting of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF). The BEF dead are commemorated by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC), with those whose died with no known grave being commemorated on the Dunkirk Memorial. The period covered is that prior to and during the Battle of Dunkirk, from September 1939 to June 1940. The memorial also commemorates those from that battle who died later in captivity and who have no known grave. Location and design The memorial forms the entrance to one of the CWGC sections of Dunkirk Town Cemetery in Dunkirk, France. Either side of the entrance gates are the inscription panels in English and French, surmounted by stone urns. There are 4,505 names listed on the memorial, which takes the form of free-standing Portland stone screen walls in two rows either side of an avenue leading to a shrine which includes a glass pane () engraved with scenes from the evacuation. Further screen walls are attached to the shrine, at the centre of which is a circular wooden seating area integrated with the cabinet containing the CWGC cemetery and memorial register. The design for the memorial was produced by Philip Hepworth, the Principal Architect for France for the Imperial War Graves Commission (later the Commonwealth War Graves Commission), while the glass engraving was by New Zealand-born engraver John Hutton. The horticultural design included a holly hedge, and English herbaceous and flowering border plants such as stocks, thymes, primroses, phlox, heathers, and violas. Unveiling and dedication The memorial was unveiled on 29 June 1957 by Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother. The Queen Mother travelled to France on HMS Chieftain. Also attending the ceremony were the Duke of Gloucester (President of the Imperial War Graves Commission), Sir Gladwyn Jebb (the British Ambassador to France), General Jean Ganeval (representing Ren√© Coty the President of France), Mayor Paul Asseman (the Mayor of Dunkirk), Field-Marshal Sir Gerald Templer (the Chief of the Imperial General Staff), and representatives of Empire (later Commonwealth) nations. Some 1600 veterans and relatives of those commemorated were at the unveiling, part of a pilgrimage to the memorial unveiling that had been organised by the Royal British Legion. In her address to the crowd, the Queen Mother declared: The memorial panels were veiled with Union Flags, with a roll of drums accompanying the unveiling of each panel. The \\"Last Post\\" was played, as well as \\"Lochaber No More\\" (played on bagpipes). The religious service included a dedication of the memorial by the Chaplain-General to the Forces Victor Pike, prayers by the Principal Roman Catholic Chaplain, Monsignor Bernard Navin, and the singing of \\"Land of Hope and Glory\\". The guards of honour were provided by the Grenadier Guards and the French 33rd Infantry Regiment. Naval tribute was paid with a gun salute from the ships offshore, and the Royal Air Force salute was given by a flypast from a Hawker Hurricane fighter aircraft. Wreaths were laid at the memorial by the Queen Mother and other dignitaries, with a wreath also laid on behalf of Sir Winston Churchill. Hundreds of wreaths were then laid by the pilgrims, including one laid by Sir Ian Fraser, President of the Royal British Legion. On the return voyage by HMS Chieftain, the Queen Mother cast a wreath into the sea off the Dunkirk beaches. Casualties commemorated Those named on the memorial include BEF servicemen who died on SS Abukir, a British steamship that was torpedoed and sunk in the North Sea while evacuating Ostend on the last day of the Battle of Belgium. The missing military personnel lost when the RMS Lancastria was sunk are also commemorated on this memorial. Among the individuals named on the memorial are Victoria Cross-recipient Lieutenant Christopher Furness, and army chaplain Leslie Philip Riches. Later history The 75th anniversary of the Dunkirk evacuation was marked at the Dunkirk Memorial on 22 May 2015, in a commemorative event organised by Dunkirk Town and attended by HRH Prince Michael of Kent. Primary school children from the local area sang the French and British national anthems while dressed in the colours of the French tricolour flag.

Andreev Bay is a radioactive waste repository, located 55 km (34 mi) northwest of Murmansk and 60 km (37 mi) from the Norwegian border on the western shore of the Zapadnaya Litsa (Kola Peninsula). The repository entered service in 1961. In February 1982, a nuclear accident occurred in which radioactive water was released from a pool in building #5. Cleanup of the accident took place from 1983 to 1989. About 700,000 tonnes (770,000 tons) of highly radioactive water leaked into the Barents Sea during that time period. About 1,000 people took part in the cleanup effort. Vladimir Konstantinovich Bulygin, who was in charge of the naval fleet's radiation accidents, received the Hero of the Soviet Union distinction for his work.  Nuclear fuel repository  The repository, constructed in the early 1960s, is a naval base on the shore of the Zapadnaya Litsa bay. It consists of two piers, a stationary mooring bay, a sanitation facility, spent fuel pools in building #5 (unused since 1989), three dry storage containers, a 40,000-tonne crane, an open-air field for storing spent nuclear fuel containers, a security checkpoint, and other technical facilities.  Building #5  Building #5 (the pool storage facility) contained two pools for storing spent fuel assemblies, encased in steel drums. Each drum contained 5-7 spent fuel assemblies, weighing 350 kg fully loaded. Each of the pools was long, wide, deep, and had a volume of . Each was designed for about 2,000 drums. The drums were suspended underwater from massive chains, which were attached to consoles a certain distance from each other to avoid an uncontrolled nuclear chain reaction from starting. The water served as biological protection. The drums were placed underwater using the chains and a crane cart, but due to the construction's unreliability, drums often fell to the bottom of the pool. As a result, spent nuclear fuel drums dangerously piled up at the bottom. One of the Andreev Bay workers recalls:  Dry storage containers  The dry storage containers consist of three steel underground blocks: \\"3A\\", \\"2A\\", and \\"2B\\": in diameter, each. Initially, the containers were designed as filtration structures for radioactive water from building #5, but after the 1982 accident, they were refitted to serve as dry storage for nuclear waste from building #5, as well as from nuclear submarines. Each container contains cells made of vertical steel pipes. The pipes are placed a set distance from each other in order to avoid starting an uncontrolled nuclear chain reaction. Each pipe is long, in diameter, and space between the pipes is filled with concrete. The \\"3A\\" container has 900 cells (for 900 drums), whereas containers \\"2A\\" and \\"2B\\" have 1,200 cells each. The drums were loaded using the KPM-40 crane. After the refitting project was approved, the concrete covers over the containers were broken in order to load the drums. Since the containers remained uncovered, loading was conducted in outdoor conditions, where precipitation fell inside unobstructed. The drums were placed into the cells, displacing water, which immediately turned into radioactive vapour, due to the heat emitted from the fuel assemblies, and wind scattered it over the entire territory of the base. In his book Andreev Nuclear Bay, A. N. Safonov writes, citing data, that the bottoms of the containers were not covered in steel and allowed groundwater to seep through. During winters, the groundwater inside the cells froze, deforming their steel covers.  Timeline of the nuclear accident  * The right-hand pool in building #5 started leaking in February 1982. Finding cracks in the metal coating required diving into the pool, which was out of the question due to the gamma radiation levels in the vicinity of the nuclear waste drums reaching 17,000 R/h. An attempt to eliminate the leak was made by pouring in 20 sacks of flour, thus filling the cracks with dough. However, the leak continued, and the service personnel discovered icing on the right side of the building. The method was clearly ineffective. The leak's volume was estimated from the size of the icing to be about 30 L/day. A commission consisting of naval specialists and the building's designers was created in order to determine the cause of the leak. The most likely cause was determined to be destruction of the pool's metal coating. * In April 1982, a study showed that the leak now let through 150 L/day, with the icing on the right side of the building having gamma-ray levels of 1.5 R/h. * In April 1982, the basement part of the building was filled with of concrete. The effort proved ineffective. * At the end of September 1982, the right-hand pool's leak reached dangerous levels of 30 tonnes per day. There was a risk of exposure of the top parts of the nuclear fuel assemblies, potentially leading to subsequent irradiation of the service personnel, as well as contamination of the entire aquatic territory of the nearby Zapadnaya Litsa bay. In order to safeguard against gamma radiation, it was proposed to cover the pool with iron-lead-concrete covers and then move the nuclear fuel assemblies into dry storage. * In November 1982, a sharp decline in the amount of leakage was detected, it was now 10 tonnes per day. Experts attribute this to the building sagging under the weight of the iron-lead-concrete covers mounted over the pool, weighing thousands of tonnes. It was later determined that it was only good fortune that prevented the collapse of the whole building. * December 1982 saw completion of cover construction over the right-hand pool, and the left-hand pool was 30% covered. All of the water from the right-hand pool drained into the bay, and the left-hand pool sprouted a leak of about 10 t/day. * A special Ministry of Defense commission arrived on 14 February 1983. It confirmed the closing of the repository, except for works related to the cleanup of the accident. No more spent nuclear fuel was loaded in building #5. * March 1983 through September 1987 saw spent fuel unloaded from the left-hand pool. All of the fuel was unloaded and sent to the Mayak nuclear facility, except for 25 drums, which could not be extracted. They were all buried in boron to capture neutron emissions. * On 13 December 1989, all of the spent nuclear fuel (about 1,500 drums) from building #5, except for the 25 remaining at the bottom of the left-hand pool, were unloaded. Building #5 was never used for storing spent nuclear fuel again. Several possible causes that led to the destruction of the pools exist: # Poor welding seam quality in the pools' coating. # Seismic activity. # The left pool sprouted a leak due to the building sagging under the weight of the biological protection (the iron-lead- concrete covers) over the right pool. # Temperature changes in the right-hand pool's water. Experts consider version #4 the most likely ‚Äî temperature changes in the pool's water stressed welding seams, tearing them. When building #5's repository was designed, it was assumed that the water would be kept at a constant temperature by heat from the nuclear assemblies suspended under the surface. A separate water heating system was thus deemed unnecessary. But the designers were wrong, the harsh Arctic climate covered the pool's surface with a layer of ice in winter. In order to solve this problem, the ice was melted using steam from the boiler, in blatant violation of radiation safety protocol. This was accomplished in the following manner: a hole was drilled in the ice cover, a pipe was inserted into the hole, and steam was pumped through the pipe under the ice, melting it. Radioactive aerosols spread through the whole building, leaking into the air outside. = An accident during the cleanup = During extraction of drums from the bottom of the pools, an accident occurred that might have cost two workers' lives. After the left-hand pool was covered with protective lids, cleanup workers cut windows inside them with torches in order to feed in a capturing device that lifted drums from the bottom. The windows were covered with iron sheets to protect the workers from radiation and prevent them from falling in. During this work, one of the workers, a starshina 1st stage, inadvertently stepped onto an iron sheet covering one of the windows. The sheet failed to support his weight, and they both fell into the pool's radioactive water. As the worker fell, his legs got caught under some nuclear waste drums, and the water splashed onto the others, who also did not have radiation protection equipment. From the memoirs of the cleanup effort's leader after the accident, A. N. Safonov: A moment later, another worker, a starshina 2nd stage, heroically jumped into the pool to save his comrade's life. A few seconds later they both surfaced, completely soaked in radioactive water. Witnesses say their faces had expressions of utter terror. The first worker himself remembers: Both workers were sent into the showers for decontamination. The dosimeter's arrow kept passing tens of millions of beta decays. Both workers had hair removed from all parts of their bodies, they slept separately from everyone else and received food in rubber gloves, since their bodies themselves were now sources of gamma radiation. The dose to which they were exposed is unknown, as their dosimeters sank in the pool. From the memoirs of A. N. Safonov: = An uncontrolled chain reaction during the cleanup = When nuclear fuel drums were unloaded from building #5 to be loaded into the dry storage containers, it often happened that cells, deformed from physical impacts and ice, spilled nuclear fuel. The working sailors then used regular shovels to pour the fuel into the cement-encased vertical steel pipes of the storage containers. These actions led to accumulation of critical mass and subsequent uncontrolled chain reactions, glowing from Cherenkov radiation and emitting a buzzing sound, which quickly subsided. Here is how A. N. Safonov describes this: Blue-green flashes of light were also observed in the left- hand pool in building #5 during the work on lifting nuclear waste drums from the bottom. That they were uncontrolled chain reactions was confirmed by the physicist, senior lieutenant Leonid Grigorievich Konobritski, who served then in building #5.

The battle came after the Nabataeans felt threatened by the Hasmonean King Alexander Jannaeus's territorial acquisitions of Gaza and several towns north of Nabataea in Transjordan, along the road to Damascus where the Greek Seleucids were stationed (the Seleucids were in terminal decline at the time). Jannaeus was \\"lucky to escape alive\\" back to Jerusalem after the Nabataean king Obodas I managed to ambush his forces on a steep hill, thought to be the hills surrounding the Yarmouk River. Jannaeus returned to fierce Jewish opposition in Jerusalem after his defeat, and had to cede the acquired territories to the Nabataeans so that he could dissuade them from supporting his opponents in Judea. Background The Nabataeans had maintained a friendly relationship with the neighboring Jewish Maccabees to the west, whose successors founded the Hasmonean dynasty. Alexander Jannaeus, the Hasmonean king, had besieged and captured Gaza around 100 BC. Jannaeus is thought to have punished the Gazans for their support to the Greek Ptolemies in Egypt over the Hasmoneans during their wars. Jannaeus then continued his father John Hyrcanus's conquests in Transjordan, where he captured Gadara, Amathus, Moab and Gilead. The Nabataeans felt threatened by these acquisitions as they had obstructed their access to the Port of Gaza, which was the last stop for goods that came from Nabataea before being shipped to European markets. The acquisition of Transjordanian towns laid another threat to Nabataean interests, and to the Seleucids in Damascus too. Battle View of the Yarmouk River. After the death of the Nabataean king Aretas II in 96 BC, his son Obodas I rose to power. Around 93 BC, Obodas managed to ambush Jannaeus and his forces in a hilly area where Jannaeus was \\"lucky to escape alive\\". The Nabataean army used a large number of camels to push the Hasmonean forces deep into a valley. The area surrounding the Yarmouk River is thought to be the location of this engagement. Aftermath Jannaeus returned to fierce Jewish opposition in Jerusalem after his defeat, and had to cede the acquired territories to the Nabataeans so that he could dissuade them from supporting his opponents in Judea. The Seleucids, based in Syria, were concerned with the growing influence of the Nabataeans, who now controlled the territories just to their south. In 87 BC, the Seleucid king Antiochus XII Dionysus waged the Battle of Cana against the Nabataeans in Gadara. Antiochus was slain during combat, demoralizing his army and turning the battle into a decisive Nabataean victory. The Seleucid army fled and largely perished from starvation in the desert afterwards. After Obodas's victories over the Hasmoneans and the Seleucids, he became the first Nabataean king to be worshipped as a god by the Nabataean people. In Avdat, in the Negev desert, a temple was built by the Nabataeans to commemorate Obodas. Inscriptions have been found inside referring to \\"Obodas the god\\".

Early life and education Siddoway completed her undergraduate education at Carleton College in 1984. Siddoway received a master's degree in 1987 from the University of Arizona, then attended the University of California, Santa Barbara where she earned her Ph.D in 1995. Her dissertation focused on the only known gneiss dome in Antarctica, in the Fosdick Mountains, Marie Byrd Land. As graduate student, she began the first of a series of studies in the Fosdick Metamorphic Complex in Marie Byrd Land with her PhD advisor and project principal investigator Bruce Luyendyk. Career and impact Siddoway's career includes multiple research seasons in the Antarctic since 1989. The central issue was when and how mid crustal rocks found here became exhumed. Her work demonstrated a role for doming and diapir intrusion, within a regional context of right lateral strike slip‚Äîleading to a model of rapid exhumation via transtension rather than orthogonal extension as in a core complex ‚Äì that had been the working model that proved to be incorrect. She continued to refine the fundamentals of the process of gneiss dome emplacement authoring a special publication on that topic with the Fosdick range as a type model. An outgrowth of the early work explored the Fosdick Mountains gneiss dome as a repository of information about crustal differentiation leading to stabilization of the landmass of Marie Byrd Land within the Antarctic continent. Siddoway co-founded the ANTscape project in 2009 which stimulated research in the reconstruction of bedrock topography of Antarctica for key intervals of the geologic past ‚Äì an important parameter for understanding the origins and evolution of the Antarctic ice sheet. Siddoway's Antarctic work has been funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation, with six NSF grants received over ten years. The recent ROSETTA-Ice Project was a collaboration with investigators -mostly women- from Columbia University, UC San Diego, and Earth Space Research, to study the framework of the Ross Ice Shelf and Embayment ([ROSETTA]-ice). The project used airborne geophysics and on-ground investigations and was funded by the National Science Foundation and the Moore Foundation. Along with her work in Antarctica, Siddoway has pursued research in the Front Range of the Colorado Rocky Mountains. This work led to a surprising result for the age of Cryogenian sandstone dikes within granite host rock, a matter that had been unresolved for more than 125 years. The Tavakaiv quartzite formation contributes to new appreciation of the time of formation of The Great Unconformity in Colorado. She is currently working on Ice sheet erosional Interaction with Hot geotherm (ICI-Hot) in West Antarctica, International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) 379, 2019-2021 Amundsen Sea ‚Äì West Antarctic Ice Sheet History, Cryogenian intracontinental sedimentary records for Rodinia, and Geodesign at Colorado College ‚Äì International Geodesign Collaborative. A recently completed project is Collaborative Research: A systems approach to understanding the Ross Ocean and ice Shelf Environment, and Tectonic setting Through Aerogeophysical surveys and modeling (ROSETTA-ICE). Siddoway has served on committees of the Geological Society of America, including as Associate Editor for the GSA Bulletin. She has also served twice on the Organizing Committee for the International Symposium on Antarctic Earth Sciences (1995, 2007) and on the Transantarctic Mountain Science Planning Committee (2015). Awards and honours Siddoway was elected a Fellow of the Geological Society of America in 2009 and received the Antarctica Service Medal in 2003.

Type EW2 tenders were rebuilt from Type CZ tenders which had entered service between 1953 and 1955 as steam condensing tenders to the Northern type condensing steam locomotives. The tenders were stripped of their condensing equipment and fitted with huge water tanks when their engines were modified to Class 25NC non-condensing locomotives between 1973 and 1980.Sabatini, Richard (2006). South African Locomotive Tender Classification, Compatibility & Allocation (1st ed.) Richard Sabatini, Kimberley, January 2006. pp. 21, 38Condenser fitter Albie Bester's reminiscencesInformation supplied by Phil GirdlestoneSAR-L Group Message #44177 by Phil Girdlestone on 10 November 2012. Does Anyone know where these were.... (Accessed on 23 July 2016) Origin Altogether 90 Type CZ steam condensing tenders were built in 1953 by Henschel and Son and North British Locomotive Company as tenders to the condensing steam locomotives. In 1963 one more was built by the South African Railways (SAR). The design work on the locomotive's condensing apparatus and the Type CZ condensing tender was carried out by Henschel, who held the patent. Rebuilding The Class 25 was a complex locomotive which required high maintenance, especially on the turbine blower fans in the smokebox, of which the blades needed to be replaced frequently due to damage by solid particles in the exhaust. The equally complex condensing tender also required frequent maintenance. Between 1973 and 1980, after serving for twenty years and partially accelerated by the introduction of electric and diesel-electric traction over routes which were previously served exclusively by the Class 25, all but three of the Class 25 condensing locomotives, numbers 3451, 3511 and 3540, were converted to free-exhausting and non-condensing locomotives and reclassified to Class 25NC. Their Type CZ condensing tenders were rebuilt to regular coal and water tenders. Since these tenders often migrated between engines during overhauls, the fleet numbers as shown are those of the rebuilt engines and are not necessarily correct for the tenders.Soul of A Railway, System 1, Part 4: Touws River to Beaufort West. Introduction par 6. (Accessed on 27 November 2016) The first conversion was done at Beaconsfield on no. 3452. The tender was stripped of its condensing equipment, but retained its original fresh water and condensate tanks and feed pumps, with the result that the boiler would now be fed with cold water, apparently with none of the ill effects which had been predicted earlier. The radiator framing and roof were panelled over. The locomotive's general appearance therefore changed little, but while the conversion of its tender was aesthetically superior when compared with subsequent conversions, it did not carry enough water.SAR-L Group Message #32783 by Phil Girdlestone on 26 July 2010. A question about a class 25 converted. (Accessed on 23 July 2016) Salt River Shops rebuild plate The rest of the fleet was rebuilt at the Salt River shops in Cape Town at a rate of about fifteen per year. On these tenders, the condensing radiators and roof fans were removed and replaced with a massive round-topped water tank. The shape and appearance of the converted tender was dictated by strength rather than aesthetic considerations. It was considered to shorten the tender's cast water-bottom frame, but it was eventually retained as it was. To replicate the Class 25NC's Type EW1 tender tank and bunker on the much longer Type CZ water-bottom frame would have exceeded the permissible axle loading by a considerable amount. The long cast steel frame of the tender was very flexible, but the radiator framing and roof had contributed a great deal to the vertical stiffness. The final form of the tender tank supplied enough strength, with its semi-circular top welded to the original fresh water tank via the fan supports and the long triangular gussets set into the bunker sides which extended past the midpoint of the frame. Locomotives with these rebuilt tenders were soon nicknamed Worshond, Afrikaans for dachshund and literally translated as sausage dog. The Worshond tenders were designated Type EW2. Characteristics The Type EW2 tender rode on three-axle bogies with roller bearings and was as long as the engine itself. The brake riggings of its bogies were independent of each other and only the front bogie was equipped with a hand brake. Almost one-third of the total length of the tender was taken up by the coal bunker, with a capacity of , while the D-shaped tank had a water capacity of . The mechanical stoker equipment had a maximum delivery rate of of coal per hour.Wardale, David (Uitlander) (1970). \\"Big Boy\\" of the Narrow Gauge - The S.A.R.'s \\"25\\" Class. Railway Digest International, Volume 1, No. 1, 1970. pp. 2-5. Classification letters Since many tender types are interchangeable between different locomotive classes and types, a tender classification system was adopted by the SAR. The first letter of the tender type indicates the classes of engines to which it can be coupled. The \\"E_\\" tenders were arranged with mechanical stokers and could be used with the locomotive classes as shown.South African Railways & Harbours/Suid Afrikaanse Spoorwe√´ en Hawens (15 Aug 1941).

The abundance of marine wealth and logistical advantages has helped the seafood export to grow especially around Aroor, Chandiroor, Ezhupunna, Thuravoor, Arookutty. Shrimp, squid, Cuttle fish and other fin fishes are some of the raw marine wealth processed and exported. There are many marine food processing units in these places which provide employment to large number of people.

It can signify both an undertaking to negotiate theoretical difference between clinicians,Borden, W. (2009). Reshaping Theory in Contemporary Social Work: Toward a Critical Pluralism. New York: Columbia University Press. and an undertaking to negotiate differences of belief occurring within the therapeutic relationship itself.Basseches, M. (1997).

Spirituality and the Challenge of Clinical Pluralism: Participatory Thinking in Psychotherapeutic Context. Spirituality in Clinical Practice, 3.3, 187‚Äì195. While the notion of clinical pluralism is associated with the practice of psychotherapy, similar issues have been raised within the field of medical ethics (see ).Masi, R. (1988). Multiculturalism, Medicine and Health Part 1: Multicultural Health Care. Canadian Family Physician, 34, 2173‚Äì2177.Tilburt, J.C., & Miller, F.G. (2007). Responding to Medical Pluralism in Practice: A Principled Ethical Approach. Journal of the American Board of Family and Medicine, 20.5, 489‚Äì494. Clinical pluralism can be applied within a particular approach to psychotherapy, such as psychoanalytic psychotherapy. Modern psychoanalytic training involves not only hours of training sessions but the use of diverse clinical practices. An example of psychoanalytic treatment following clinical pluralism is coparticipant psychoanalysis, which features an individualized treatment but is diverse in the practices employed. This technique holds that all analyses represent unique sets of practices, which depend on the varying characteristics of the personalities that make up the analytic dyad. Clinical pluralism is also associated with eclectic and integrative psychotherapy, which are distinguished from clinical practice that follows a specific theoretical school with its own therapeutic techniques. These approaches to therapy all maintain that there is no single theory or therapeutic modality that can offer optimum efficacy.

They form a distinct group of people, descended from indigenous people, Europeans and Africans. Their traditional way of life based on subsistence agriculture, hunting and fishing is threatened by real estate speculation, restrictive laws and declining fish stocks. Cumuruxatiba, Bahia Origins The name cai√ßara comes from the Tupi language ka'ays√° (or ka'aysara), a rustic fence made of tree branches. The fences would surround a village, or would be used for trapping fish. Over time it came to be used for the huts built on the beaches, and then for the inhabitants. The people are of mixed indigenous, European and African origins. Their origins and customs are similar to the caipiras who live further inland. In literature the cai√ßaras are represented as traditional, primitive, isolated and self-sufficient fishing people. This is an inaccurate stereotype, since it was only with the arrival of motor boats and fishing vessels in the 20th century that the communities were led to partly or entirely abandon agriculture in favour of fishing. Economy Fishermen hauling in a boat in Guaruj√°, S√£o Paulo state The cai√ßaras make their living through artisan fishery, agriculture, hunting, gathering, crafts and more recently ecotourism. Activities are preferably based on a calendar based on phases of the moon. Agriculture is based on the coivara system, a sustainable technique handed down by the Indians. A clearing in the forest is cut and burned, planted for three years, then lies fallow for three to ten years before being reused. Common crops are sweet and bitter cassava, beans, corn, rice, sugarcane and bananas. Other subsistence activities are hunting, trapping and fishing with rods, nets and traps. Hunted, trapped or snared animals include agouti, armadillo, coati, capybara and peccary. Hunted birds include the tinamou, black-fronted piping guan and toucan. Hunting has been illegal since the 1980s. Lifestyle threats The traditional lifestyle of the native population is threatened by real estate speculation and over- fishing. The cai√ßaras are vulnerable due to high levels of illiteracy, lack of education and information, lack of organization into groups and lack of communication methods such as telephones or even mail.

Merlo was an extensive writer and traveler as she penned articles for her order and made visits across the world to communities that were established in nations such as the United States of America and Australia. The beatification process commenced in the 1960s though the formal introduction of the cause was initiated in 1982. Pope John Paul II conferred the title of Venerable upon her in 1991 after confirming that she had lived a model life of heroic virtue. Life =Childhood and education= Maria Teresa Merlo was born on 20 February 1894 in Cuneo as the second of four children to the peasants Ettore Merlo and Vincenza Rolando; her siblings were all brothers: the priest Leone Costanzo, Giovanni Battista and Carlo. She received the sacrament of baptism on 22 February 1894 in the parish church of Saint John the Baptist and received it from Father Pietro Palladino; her godparents were Leone Merlo and Margherita Rava Rolando. From 1901 until 1903 she commenced her initial education though in 1903 her studies halted after her parents decided to arrange private studies under the teacher Maria Chiarla. She received her First Communion in her parish church on 23 April 1902 and received her Confirmation from Bishop Giovanni Francesco Re on 29 September 1907 in the same church; her sponsor was Carolina Zocca Barbero. She received initial training as a seamstress and then began learning sewing in Alba from 1908 to 1911 at \\"Ritiro della Providenza\\" institute that the Sisters of Saint Anne ran; her parents later sent her to Turin to complete her training as a seamstress. On one occasion she found herself in Susa and wrote to her parents from there on 19 March 1912. In 1912 ‚Äì in her parents' home ‚Äì she established a sewing school for other people. =Religious foundations= On 27 June 1915 she met Blessed Giacomo Alberione in the church of Santi Cosma e Damiano in Alba in the presence of her mother; she later wrote of this encounter in 1961. Merlo desired to live the life of a religious and so decided to pursue this call; she received the encouragement of Alberione who convinced her to help him found a religious order he had been thinking of establishing. On 29 June 1915 she moved into the home of Angela Boffi to help found this order with Alberione and in 1923 later recounted of Boffi: \\"We understood each other; came to an agreement and began to love each other as true sisters\\". She co- founded the Daughters of Saint Paul alongside Alberione in 1915. From August 1915 until 1918 she and her companions frequented the Catechetical League in the church of Santi Cosma e Damiano and began to attend religious education courses that the canon Chiesa (1874-1946) ran and also began to teach catechism in that parish. In 1916 she attended a series of spiritual exercises that Alberione oversaw and made her initial vows in the latter's hands on 29 June 1916 ‚Äì the Feast of Saints Peter and Paul. Merlo undertook a written examination on 6 August 1916 for catechesis instructors and on 12 November 1916 began to work as a teacher of catechism in the parish of Santi Cosma e Damiano; she undertook an oral examination on 27 October 1918 for catechists. She continued to serve to that effect as a teacher until 18 December 1918 when she left for Susa with Emilia Biano ‚Äì her companion ‚Äì as well as two others, Mariuccia Prinotti and Caterina Petean, while Boffi left the priori 16 December with the seminarian Bartolomeo Marcellino. On 12 November 1919 a fire burnt their residence in Susa which prompted them ‚Äì for two weeks ‚Äì to reside as guests with the Third Order of Saint Francis and then as guests of the \\"Casa della Beneficenza\\". On 22 July 1922 she and eight others made their religious profession and she assumed the new name of \\"Tecla\\"; Alberione made her Superior General for a 12-year duration. Boffi left the order on 4 November 1922, which upset Merlo due to the two being close friends. Merlo also parted with the Saint Paul Bookshop on 12 March 1923 and handed it over to Mr. Enrico Piazza. From 1923 until 1924 she began to record her beginnings in the congregation ‚Äì a series of them were later published in the Pauline Cooperators' Bulletin between June 1923 and April 1925. Alberione later founded the Pious Disciples of the Divine Master and appointed Merlo as its Superior General on 10 February 1924 ‚Äì she held that position until 25 March 1947. On 16 January 1926 she dispatched two sisters under the guidance of Amalia Peyrolo to oversee the establishment of the generalate in Rome; on the previous 14 January two other sisters ‚Äì under the guidance of Blessed Timoteo Giaccardo ‚Äì left for the same destination for similar motives. Boffi died on 20 October 1926 and in tears Merlo communicated the news to her fellow sisters: \\"I owe so much to Maestra Boffi\\". In May 1927 she visited the generalate in Rome in what could have been her first visit. She and other sisters assumed the habit for the first time on 30 October 1928 while she later travelled to Salerno on 5 November 1928 with a group of religious to set up a house of the order there. She likewise travelled with other religious to Cagliari on 5 February 1929 for the same mission. Merlo made her perpetual profession into the hands of Alberione on 19 March 1929 and later sent her first circular letter as Superior General to the communities of the congregation on 26 December 1929. She travelled to Messina in June 1931 to assist in the establishment of a new house and on 29 November 1932 drew up her will in which she declared all she possessed would go to the congregation after her death. Some of her writings became available after the order's internal news source Eco di Casa Madre commenced its printing run on 1 January 1934. In December 1935 ‚Äì upon Alberione's advice ‚Äì she issued rules that demanded mandatory periodical correspondence between sisters and their Superior General with a particular focus on Christmas and the feast of Saint Paul. =International travels= Merlo made her first international travels on 26 March 1926 after departing Genoa on the ship \\"Augustus\\" for Brazil and Argentina, while returning to Rome on 27 August 1936; she relocated to the generalate on 11 November 1936. She made another sojourn on 28 January 1937 after leaving on the steamship \\"Rex\\" to visit homes in New York City in the United States of America, returning to Rome on 6 March 1937. In 1938 her health was poor but she spent time in Genzano with the Pastorelle Sisters. Her father died on 9 March 1941 and she decided to spend a period of deep reflection back in Alba in August 1941. On 8 September 1941 ‚Äì on Alberione's advice ‚Äì she convoked superiors of the order for a special course of spiritual exercises on the subject of spiritual renewal. She and other sisters were fortunate to be spared after World War II bombings at Grottaferrata and later on 21 October 1943 welcomed 26 Benedictine nuns to the generalate after their convent was bombed; the Benedictines remained there until 18 August 1944. She was forced to decrease her workload in November 1945 due to a stint of bad health. On 28 December 1945 ‚Äì with Alberione ‚Äì she left Naples on the ship \\"Andrea Gritti\\" to visit houses in the U.S.A. as well as Argentina and Brazil; on the return home the ship docked back in the U.S.A. and the pair arrived back in Rome on 23 May 1946. Her mother died on 18 January 1947. On 2 September 1948 she opened a health-care clinic in Albano. Merlo and Alberione then departed on 3 April 1949 to visit communities in the U.S.A. and Mexico and then to India, Japan and the Philippines and made their return to Rome on 14 June 1952. She visited houses in France and Spain on 30 September 1949 and returned to Rome on 11 October 1949. In 1950, filming of Mater Dei took place and Merlo acted as the prophetess Anna. On 21 March 1952 she and Alberione visited the U.S.A. and Canada and then to Mexico before heading to Chile, Brazil and Argentina; the pair returned to Rome on 14 June 1952. She visited French communities on 12 July 1952 and returned to the generalate on 26 July 1952. On 13 April 1953 she and Alberione embarked to visit Japan, India and the Philippines and returned to Rome on 22 May 1952; the two later left again on 13 July 1953 to go to Canada and the U.S.A. in the north while visiting Colombia, Chile, Brazil and Argentina, returning to Rome on 3 September 1953. Merlo was elected as the president of F.I.R.A.S during the Second National Council of Mothers General held in Rome from 5‚Äì10 September 1953. She travelled to France, Spain and Portugal on 1 November 1953 for visitations and returned to Rome on 18 November 1953. She returned to France for a brief visit on 14 April 1954. She and Alberione then embarked on 16 April 1955 for the Philippines, Japan, India and Australia while coming back to Rome on 2 June 1955; Merlo however returned to Australia on 13 May 1955 to open a new home there in Sydney. She travelled on 27 July 1955 to the United Kingdom, France, Spain and Portugal for more visitations and returned to the generalate on 22 August 1955. She and Alberione then embarked on 12 September 1955 to the U.S.A. and Canada before going to Mexico, Colombia, Chile, Argentina and Brazil and returning to Rome on 12 December 1955; she wrote to the generalate from the U.S.A. sometime in September 1955. She travelled to the U.K. and Spain on 25 July 1956 and returned to Rome on 31 July 1956. Merlo convoked ‚Äì on 7 February 1957 ‚Äì the first General Chapter of the order that would be celebrated from 4‚Äì7 May 1957 and she was reappointed as Superior General on 4 May 1957 for another 12-year term. She underwent major surgery ‚Äì a mastectomy ‚Äì on 23 February 1957 at the Regina Apostolorum Clinic and her surgeon was Doctor Francesco Ojetti. She and Lucia Rici departed on 14 September 1959 to visit the U.S.A. and Canada as well as visiting Mexico, Venezuela, Colombia, Chile, Argentina and Brazil while the return trip saw a stop in Mexico and the return to Rome on 13 February 1960; Merlo also visited London on 5 August 1960 and Madrid on 18 September 1960 while returning to Rome on 1 October 1960. Merlo underwent a series of spiritual exercises from 15 May 1961 until 5 June 1961 in Ariccia that both Alberione and Father Luigi Rolfo led and she later visited homes in Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in November 1961 and returned to Rome on 9 November 1961. On 24 January 1962 she departed for India, the Philippines, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan and Australia and made the return trip to the generalate in Rome on 19 May 1962. But Merlo fell ill in March 1962 while in the Philippines which prompted Costantina Bignante to be sent from Rome to both take care of her and remain with her for the rest of the trip. On 5 August 1962 she visited the U.S.A. and Canada and came back to Rome on 3 September 1962. Her final international visit was back to Kinshasa on 8 May 1963 and she came back to Rome on 17 May 1963. Merlo suffered a brain seizure on 16 June 1963 and was hospitalized in Albano where on 17 June 1963 her three brothers visited her. Merlo travelled to Rome on 7 July 1963 and on 22 August 1963 met with Pope Paul VI on the occasion of his visit to the Regina Apostolorum hospital in Albano. She returned to Rome on 23 September 1963 and the following 26 September made a brief stop to Grottaferrata. She later fell ill on 22 November 1963 and her health was so frail to the point that Alberione gave her the Anointing of the Sick. =Death= Merlo died from a brain hemorrhage on 5 February 1964 in Alberione's presence. The latter presided over a Mass in the hospital's chapel on the following 7 February while Cardinal Arcadio Larraona Saralegui celebrated the solemn funeral Mass on 8 February in the church of Santa Maria Regina degli Apostoli Montagnola. Merlo was buried at Campo Verano, but was exhumed on 3 February 1967 and her remains taken to the church for a special Mass on 6 February and the re- interment on 7 February. Alberione said of Merlo's death: \\"It was the Lord who sustained her. She was a contemplative person. She had recourse to people but she had recourse first and foremost to God\\". Beatification cause The beatification process commenced in an informative process that opened in Albano on 26 October 1967 and concluded its work ‚Äì after having collected documentation and available interrogatories (including that of Alberione) ‚Äì on 23 March 1972. A smaller process opened in Alba on 10 December 1968 and closed on 4 May 1971 while theologians approved her writings as being orthodox on 24 May 1974. An apostolic process was held from 21 October 1982 until 17 June 1987. The formal introduction to the cause was issued on 25 February 1982 once the Congregation for the Causes of Saints voiced approval at the continuation of the cause and the conferral of the posthumous title of Servant of God upon the late religious. The C.C.S. validated the three previous processes in Rome on 18 December 1987 and later received the official Positio from the postulation in 1989. Theologians voiced approval to the cause on 22 June 1990 as did the C.C.S. themselves on 4 December 1990. This all culminated on 22 January 1991 once Pope John Paul II confirmed that she had lived a model Christian life of heroic virtue and thus named her Venerable. The miracle needed for beatification was investigated in the diocese of its origin and received full C.C.S. validation on 26 September 1996 while a medical board based in Rome issued approval of the purported miracle on 16 December 1999. The current postulator that is assigned to the cause is the Rev. Jos√© Antonio P√©rez S√°nchez.

The pseudopodia engulf any food that gets trapped on the spines and carry it to the middle of the cell to be digested. This species is also a polycystine radiolarian.

His work was related to color field painting, lyrical abstraction and other forms of abstract art. Forma 1 artists: Pietro Consagra, Mino Guerrini, Ugo Attardi, Carla Accardi, Achille Perilli, Antonio Sanfilippo, Giulio Turcato, and Piero Dorazio (sitting below). Early life Dorazio was born in Rome. His father was a civil servant, while his mother was interested in history and art. Dorazio attended Julius Caesar Lyceum (high school) in Rome. The family fled to their homeland province of Abruzzo in 1943. After the war, Dorazio worked briefly as a translator for the British Army and then studied architecture at the University of Rome.Piero Dorazio: Italian painter inspired by the revolutionary power of abstract art. Obituary, by Christopher Masters for The Guardian, 26 May 2005. He was influenced by futurists such as Gino Severini, Antonio Corpora, Enrico Prampolini, and Giacomo Balla, attracting him to painting. An aversion to their right-wing views pushed him to align instead with left-leaning artists like Renato Guttuso.Obituary by C. Masters for The Guardian in 2005. Along with Pietro Consagra, Achille Perilli, and Giulio Turcato, he helped formulate a manifesto and establish a group of abstract artists in 1947 called Forma I. Although imbued with socialist leanings, the group did not follow the realist social commentary furthered by Guttuso but proposed to reclaim abstraction from Futurism. In 1947 Dorazio won a prize and a stipend from the French government to study at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts of Paris.Ken Johnson May 2005 Obituary in Art and Design section of New York Times. Dorazio, along with artists Mino Perilli and Guerrini, helped found L'Age d'Or in 1950. It was a bookstore/gallery space dedicated to abstract art. In 1952, he promoted the foundation Origin with Alberto Burri, Ettore Colla and others, and edited the magazine Arti Visive. As a representative of Italy, in 1953 he traveled for the first time to the United States to participate in the International Summer Seminar at Harvard University. That fall, he moved to New York City and stayed through 1954. In October 1953, Dorazio had his first solo exhibition at George Wittenborn's One-Wall Gallery. He published La Fantasia Dell-Arte Nella Vita Moderna\\" in 1955, a review of modern art in Italy. Regarding this book, reviewer Christopher Masters states that Dorazio advanced his belief, perhaps with a surfeit of optimism, that \\"abstract art could change the world... That just as science and technology were destroying the barriers between different cultures, so the new 'universal style' would lead to a 'universal civilisation'.\\"Obituary by C. Masters for The Guardian in 2005. He was invited to teach at the Graduate School of Fine Arts program at the University of Pennsylvania School of Design in 1959. He taught painting there for one semester each year from 1960 to 1969, splitting his time between the United States and Italy. In 1970 he returned to live and work full-time in Rome.Ken Johnson May 2005 Obituary in Art and Design section of New York Times. In 1974 he moved his studio from Rome to Umbria, near Todi. Peter Iden, founding director of the Museum f√ºr Moderne Kunst Frankfurt from 1978-1987, acquired three works by Dorazio from 1981 to 1983 (Oracolo, 1959; Blue Hearttrap, 1961; Stridente, 1982-83) for the museum collection.Iden, Peter; Lauter, Rolf (ed.): Bilder f√ºr Frankfurt: Bestandskatalog des Museums f√ºr Moderne Kunst, M√ºnchen, Prestel 1985, ; These were part of the museum exhibitions in Frankfurt in 1985 and Milan in 1987.Iden, Peter; Lauter, Rolf : Dalla pop art americana alla nuova figurazione : opere del Museo d'arte moderna di Francoforte, Padiglione d'arte contemporanea, Milan, 1987. In the 1990s, the works were temporarily loaned to the European Central Bank. Dorazio continued to work and exhibit until 2004. Described as an \\"outspoken, independent character\\" who was the \\"opposite of politically correct\\", Dorazio's use of materials and colors stayed constant over time. He is mostly known for paintings with thick bands of bright color and crosshatched grids.Obituary by C. Masters for The Guardian in 2005.

Early life At the age of 12, after the death of his father, Youngblood moved from Virginia to Florida where he started learning to play guitar at age 15. Shortly after his move he began playing in his first band with school mates from the neighborhood. Through this he met drummer Richard Warner, and they decided to start a band together. Career Kamelot was founded in Tampa, Florida by Youngblood and Richard Warner in 1991. They signed their first contract in 1994 with German label Noise Records. Six albums were released through the label. After the release of Epica in 2003 they started working with SPV/Steamhammer. With them they released The Black Halo (2005) and Ghost Opera (2007), after a temporary switch to Edel Music for the release of Poetry for the Poisoned (2010), they were back with SPV for another release with Silverthorn (2012). Currently the band is under contract with Napalm Records, Universal, ADA/Warner and King Records and released the album Haven in 2015. Youngblood was the main composer of Kamelot's music from 1994 to 1998, collaborating with singer Roy Khan from 1998 to 2010. When Khan decided to leave the band, Tommy Karevik (Seventh Wonder) became the new singer. The new composing/writing team of the band consists of Thomas Youngblood, Oliver Palotai (keyboards), Sascha Paeth (producer) and Tommy Karevik (vocals). During Kamelot live shows Youngblood sings backing vocals and harsh vocals (\\"March of Mephisto\\") if needed. The song \\"Don't You Cry\\" is dedicated to his father and \\"Hunter's Season\\" to his mother. Youngblood in 2007 Youngblood is the only founding member continuously active in the band since its formation. He is also the CEO of KMI Entertainment, who are responsible for Kamelot's management and booking. With Kamelot, Youngblood played multiple headliner tours during the last 20 years in America, Asia, Australia and Europe and some of the biggest festivals like Wacken Open Air, Sweden Rock Festival, Sonisphere Festival, and Rock am Ring. Youngblood collaborated with Mark Vanderbilt (ex-Kamelot vocals) in the late 1990s for a project called \\"Monarque\\". The song \\"Arion\\" was released on the compilation CD \\"POWERQUEST ‚Äì The Awakening\\". Consortium Project is the brainchild of Ian Parry, vocalist of the Dutch band Elegy. Youngblood and Ian Parry met when Elegy toured with Kamelot in 1998. When the first album Consortium Project was recorded, Youngblood was part of it. Other contributions by Patrick Rondat, Arjen Lucassen, Stephan Lill and others. Youngblood also contributed on the second album Continuum in Extremis in 2001. He has co-songwriting credits for \\"Poetic Justice\\". In 2003, Youngblood was invited to play guitars on the metal opera Days of Rising Doom by supergroup Aina, a project of Amanda Sommerville, Sascha Paeth, Robert Hunecke-Rizzo and Michael Rodenberg. In 2003, another collaboration between Ian Parry and Thomas Youngblood came to fruit. They recorded the song \\"Flight of Icarus\\" for the Iron Maiden tribute double album Slave to the Power. Personal life Youngblood lives in Tampa with his wife Mari, a soprano vocalist. Mari Youngblood made appearances as guest artist on Kamelot's Epica and The Black Halo, as well as live appearances in 2007 and on the live DVD One Cold Winter's Night. The voice of their daughter Annelise appears in \\"Soul Society\\" (The Black Halo) and the nursery rhyme of \\"Sacrimony\\" (Silverthorn). The voice of their son Thomas can be heard as the chorus in \\"Burns to Embrace\\" (The Shadow Theory) His main inspirations are varied and range from metal to new age. In addition to playing guitar, Youngblood plays drums, saxophone and keyboard.

The Panjal Traps are associated with the opening of the Neo-Tethys Ocean, which resulted in the dispersal of the Cimmerian continental blocks from the north-eastern margin of Gondwana and possibly the break-up of this old and large continent. In the Zanskar-Spliti-Lahaul area (in the north- western Himalayas and south-east Ladakh) the -thick basalts of the Panjal Traps are mostly exposed as massive (terrestrial) lava flows, but also as (marine) pillow lavas and hyaloclastites. The Panjal Traps were first documented in 1824 and were eventually named by British geologist Richard Lydekker in 1883, but their origin, age, and relationship with surrounding and underlying rocks remained elusive for more than a century. They remained one of the most understudied LIPs before being properly dated to 289 Ma in 2011. Geological setting Late Carboniferous to Early Permian deposits of Tethyan affinity in the Zanskar-Spiti area are mostly terrigenous, detrital sedimentary rocks, although some magmatic activity documented in Pakistan and central Nepal has been associated with this period. These sedimentary layers are associated with the erosion that followed the uplift of the margins of the newly rifted Indian continent. In the eastern and central Himalayas more voluminous volcanic eruptions have been documented from the same period. The Abor volcanics produced of basaltic to andesitic flows and tuffs. In the Late Permian (Sakmarian-Roadian) the theoliitic Nar-Tsum(?) produced of spilites and Bhote Kosi basalts in southern Tibet. The slightly younger (Artinskian- Kazanian) Panjal Traps produced the largest magmatic province in north-western India. Its lava flows now covers 105 km2, from the eastern Zanskar-Spliti- Lahaul area to north-eastern Pakistan and they filled a rifted valley called the Zanskar-Spiti synclinorium. The original extent of the Panjal Traps may have exceeded 0.2x106 km2, a distribution similar to those of the Emeishan LIP in south-western China and the Columbia River basalts in north-western United States. In Ladakh and in the Kashmir Basin the flows are thick with a smaller amount of pyroclastics overlain by aphyric basaltic flows. In north-eastern Pakistan the Panjal flows are exposed as dykes cross-cutting the basement and Early Paleozoic layers, and as inter-layered magmatic flows on Late Plaeozoic to Early Mesozoic layers with Tethyan affinity. The eruption of the Panjal Traps was followed (Kazanian-Djulfian) by the emplacement of a succession of sediments, the result of the progressive thermo-tectonic subsidence of the Indian passive margin associated with the expanding Neo-Tethys. Tectonic implications The Panjal Traps have been associated with either the Mid- Capitanian (260 Ma) or End-Permian (251 Ma) mass extinction events. Analyses of zircon crystals have, however, yielded an 206U/238Pb age of 289¬±2 Ma ‚Äî considerably older than these mass extinctions. The Panjal Traps can, nevertheless, be linked to the African large low-shear-velocity province (or superplume) and, as such, is most likely responsible for the widespread flood basalts in the Himalayas, but the Siberian Traps (251 Ma) are probably a better candidate for these younger mass extinctions. Late Carboniferous- Permian LIPs (such as Jutland, Panjal, Tarim, Emeishan and Siberia) were emplaced before the break-up of Pangaea whereas the post-Permian LIPs were involved in the break-up of the supercontinent. Mantle plume-derived LIPs share features such as large-volume flood basalts, short duration, uplift and doming of the crust before eruption, and high temperature-melts such as komatiites and picrites. The chemical and isotopic composition of samples of basalt taken from the eastern Kashmir Valley are similar to within-plate basalts, and probably derived from a spinel peridotite source. Samples taken from the western side of the valley are more primitive, derived from a more depleted source. This suggests that Panjal made a transition from a newly formed continental setting, where the basalt composition was 'enriched OIB- like', to an old ocean basin, where the composition was 'depleted MORB-like'. Chemically, the Panjal basalts are similar to those from post-Permian/post- Pangaean LIPs. Paleomagnetic data from the Kashmir Valley indicate the Panjal eruption occurred at a paleolatitude of c. 33¬∞ (¬±5¬∞)S.

The park was established in 1933. Setting Entrance on US2 The park is located on the eastern shore of Lake Champlain, north of Vermont's largest city, Burlington. It is located along United States Route Route 2 on the eastern end of a natural sandbar that spans the lake between the town of Milton in Chittenden County on the Vermont mainland and South Hero Island in Grand Isle County. Most of the sandbar is now topped by a causeway carrying US 2. The park occupies a roughly triangular parcel of land, bounded on the east by the Sand Bar Wildlife Management Area, also operated by the state. Sand Bar Park Road extends north from US 2, providing access to the park's facilities. Facilities Bathhouse Park facilities include a sand beach, canoe and kayak rentals, a food concession, picnic tables with cooking grills, volleyball courts, horseshoes, and swings. The most prominent built feature of the park is a large stone bathhouse. It was built by the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) in 1933-35. with Activities includes swimming, boating, fishing, hiking, picnicking, wildlife watching, water sports and winter sports. History The park was Vermont's sixth state park and the first to be created on land purchased by the state. The land was developed in 1933 under the provisions of a 1929 state law authorizing such purchases. At first, it was primarily swampy marshland, which crews of the CCC cleared, filled, and graded. In addition to the bathhouse, the CCC also built a stone grill which still stands in the park. The upper level of the bathhouse was originally used as living quarters for caretakers and lifeguards but is now used for storage, while the rest of the structure, only modified to provide electricity and plumbing, continues in its original use. A reduced area of the park (about ) of the park surrounding the bathhouse was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002 for its CCC-related elements.

Here is an approximate representation of the TiƒÅnm√©n (\\"Gate of Heaven\\") or TiƒÅnsh≈´ (\\"Pivot of Heaven\\") as the precessional north celestial pole, with Œ± Ursae Minoris as the pole star, with the spinning Chariot constellations in the four phases of time. According to Reza Assasi's theories, the wan may not only be centred in the current precessional pole at Œ± Ursae Minoris, but also very near to the north ecliptic pole if Draco (TiƒÅnl√≥ng ) is conceived as one of its two beams. Chinese theology, which comes in different interpretations according to the classic texts and the common religion, and specifically Confucian, Taoist and other philosophical formulations, is fundamentally monistic, that is to say it sees the world and the gods of its phenomena as an organic whole, or cosmos, which continuously emerges from a simple principle. This is expressed by the concept that \\"all things have one and the same principle\\" (w√†nw√π yƒ´l«ê ). This principle is commonly referred to as TiƒÅn , a concept generally translated as \\"Heaven\\", referring to the northern culmen and starry vault of the skies and its natural laws which regulate earthly phenomena and generate beings as their progenitors. Ancestors are therefore regarded as the equivalent of Heaven within human society, and therefore as the means connecting back to Heaven which is the \\"utmost ancestral father\\" ( zƒìngz«îf√π). Chinese theology may be also called TiƒÅnxu√© (\\"study of Heaven\\"), a term already in use in the 17th and 18th century. The universal principle that gives origin to the world is conceived as transcendent and immanent to creation, at the same time. The Chinese idea of the universal God is expressed in different ways; there are many names of God from the different sources of Chinese tradition, reflecting a \\"hierarchic, multiperspective\\" observation of the supreme God. Chinese scholars emphasise that the Chinese tradition contains two facets of the idea of God: one is the personified God of popular devotion, and the other one is the impersonal God of philosophical inquiry. Together they express an \\"integrated definition of the monistic world\\". Interest in traditional Chinese theology has waxed and waned over the various periods of the history of China. For instance, the Great Leap Forward enacted in the mid-20th century involved the outright destruction of traditional temples in accordance with Maoist ideology. From the 1980s onward, public revivals have taken place. The Chinese believe that deities or stars, are arranged in a \\"celestial bureaucracy\\" which influences earthly activities and is reflected by the hierarchy of the Chinese state itself. These beliefs have similarities with broader Asian shamanism. The alignment of earthly and heavenly forces is upheld through the practice of rites, for instance the jiao festivals in which sacrificial offerings of incense and other products are set up by local temples, participants hoping to renew the perceived alliance between community leaders and the gods. pp. 198‚Äì199. pp. 89‚Äì90: \\"According to the Chinese view, the circumpolar stars represent the palace surrounding the emperor, who is the pole star, and the various members of the celestial bureaucracy. Indeed, the Chinese saw the night sky as a mirror of the empire, and saw the empire as a mirror of the sky, on earth. The sky was ... tian ..., and the empire had the authority of tian\\". Creation as ordering of primordial potentiality The north ecliptic pole (Bƒõij√≠ , represented by a red dot which does not correspond to any astral body since the north ecliptic pole is starless, W√∫j√≠, \\"without pole\\") coiled by Draco (TiƒÅnl√≥ng ), which slithers between the Little Dipper and the Big Dipper (Great Chariot), respectively representing yin and yang, death and life. As the symbol of the \\"protean\\" primordial power which contains yin and yang as one, the dragon is the curved line in-between yin and yang in the \\"diagram of the Supreme Pole\\" ( T√†ij√≠t√∫, of T√†ij√≠) ‚Üí 20px. Small seal script form, from the Shuowen Jiezi, of k: q√¨ (pneuma, \\"breath\\", \\"matter‚Äìenergy\\", \\"power\\" of Heaven). Because all beings are considered coalescences of it, some scholars have employed the term \\"(poly)pneumatism\\", first coined by Walter Medhurst (1796‚Äì1857), to describe Chinese spirituality. The many gods are often defined as \\"traces\\" ( jƒ´) of coalescence of the qi. Xu√°nw«î, the motif of the snake winding the turtle. While the snake, as the dragon, represents qi, the primordial power of the universe and the constellation Draco at the north ecliptic pole; the turtle represents the cosmos, with \\"the round carapace representing the dome of the skies and the squarish plastron the squared earth\\". At the same time they represent two of the four constellations which perfectly enclose, in a square, the north ecliptic pole centred in Draco: Snake (drawn in Corona Borealis + northern stars of Herculs + northern stars of Bo√∂tes), Turtle (Cassiopeia), Sword (central stars of Cygnus) and the Big Dipper.. As explained by the scholar Stephan Feuchtwang, in Chinese cosmology \\"the universe creates itself out of a primary chaos of material energy\\" (hundun and qi ), organising as the polarity of yin and yang which characterises any thing and life. Creation is therefore a continuous ordering; it is not a creation ex nihilo. Yin and yang are the invisible and the visible, the receptive and the active, the unshaped and the shaped; they characterise the yearly cycle (winter and summer), the landscape (shady and bright), the sexes (female and male), and even sociopolitical history (disorder and order). The gods themselves are divided in yin forces of contraction, gu«ê (\\"demons\\" or \\"ghosts\\") and yang forces of expansion sh√©n (\\"gods\\" or \\"spirits\\"); in the human being they are the hun and po (where hun () is yang and po () is yin; respectively the rational and emotional soul, or the ethereal and the corporeal soul). Together, guishen is another way to define the twofold operation of the God of Heaven, its resulting dynamism being called itself shen, spirit. By the words of the Neo-Confucian thinker Cheng Yi: Another Neo-Confucian, Zhu Xi, says: The dragon, associated to the constellation Draco winding the north ecliptic pole and slithering between the Little and Big Dipper (or Great Chariot), represents the \\"protean\\" primordial power, which embodies both yin and yang in unity, and therefore the awesome unlimited power (qi) of divinity. In Han-dynasty traditions, Draco is described as the spear of the supreme God. Heaven continuously begets‚Äîaccording to its own manifest model which is the starry vault revolving around the northern culmen ( Bƒõij√≠)‚Äîand reabsorbs, the temporal things and worlds. As explained in modern Confucian theology: Rather than \\"creation\\" ( z√†o), which has a long Western connotation of creation ex nihilo, modern Chinese theologians prefer to speak of \\"evolution\\" ( hu√†) to describe the begetting of the cosmos; even in modern Chinese language the two concepts are frequently held together, z√†ohu√† (\\"creation-evolution\\"). Such ordering power, which belongs to deities but also to humans, expresses itself in rites ( l«ê). They are the means by which alignment between the forces of the starry sky, of earthly phenomena, and the acts of human beings (the three realms of Heaven- Earth-humanity, TiƒÅnd√¨r√©n), is established. Such harmonisation is referred to as \\"centring\\" ( yƒÅng or zh≈çng). Rituals may be performed by government officials, family elders, popular ritual masters and Taoists, the latter cultivating local gods to centre the forces of the universe upon a particular locality. Since humans are capable of centring natural forces, by the means of rites, they are themselves \\"central\\" to creation. So, human beings participate in the ongoing creation-evolution of the God of Heaven, acting as ancestors who may produce and influence other beings: The metaphor of the moon. The relationship between oneness and multiplicity, between the supreme principle and the myriad things, is notably explained by Zhu Xi through the \\"metaphor of the moon\\": In his terminology, the myriad things are generated as effects or actualities ( y√≤ng) of the supreme principle, which, before in potence ( t«ê), sets in motion qi. The effects are different, forming the \\"myriad species\\" ( w√†nsh≈´), each relying upon their myriad modifications of the principle, depending on the varying contexts and engagements. Difference exists not only between the various categories of beings, but among individuals belonging to the same category as well, so that each creature is a unique coalescence of the cosmic principle. The qi of kindred beings accord and communicate with one another, and the same happens for the qi of worshippers and the god receiving sacrifice, and for the qi of an ancestor and his descendants. All beings are, at different levels, \\"in\\" the God of Heaven, not in the sense of addition but in the sense of belonging. In the Confucian tradition, the perfect government is that which emulates the ordering of the stary vault of Heaven: Names and attributes of the God of Heaven in the tradition culmen of the skies, which is Tian, as a liubo board. The Luoshu square, the Hetu, liubo boards, sundials, Han diviner's boards (sh√¨ ) and luopan for fengshui, and the derived compass, as well as TLV mirrors, are all representations of the supreme God as the squared north celestial pole.

Volume I: The Ancient Eurasian World and the Celestial Pivot, p. 216. Since the Shang (1600‚Äì1046 BCE) and Zhou dynasty 1046‚Äì256 BCE), the radical Chinese terms for the supreme God are TiƒÅn and Sh√†ngd√¨ (the \\"Highest Deity\\") or simply D√¨ (\\"Deity\\"). Another concept is T√†id√¨ (the \\"Great Deity\\"). These names are combined in different ways in Chinese theological literature, often interchanged in the same paragraph if not in the same sentence. One of the combinations is the name of God used at the Temple of Heaven in Beijing, which is the \\"Highest Deity the Heavenly King\\" ( Hu√°ngtiƒÅn Sh√†ngd√¨); others are \\"Great Deity the Heavenly King\\" ( TiƒÅnhu√°ng D√†d√¨) and \\"Supreme Deity of the Vast Heaven\\" ( H√†otiƒÅn Sh√†ngd√¨). God is considered manifest in this world as the northern culmen and starry vault of the skies which regulate nature. As its see, the circumpolar stars (the Little and Big Dipper, or broader Ursa Minor and Ursa Major) are known, among various names, as TiƒÅnm√©n (\\"Gate of Heaven\\") p. 190. and TiƒÅnsh≈´ (\\"Pivot of Heaven\\"), or the \\"celestial clock\\" regulating the four seasons of time. p. 343, note 17. The Chinese supreme God is compared to the conception of the supreme God identified as the north celestial pole in other cultures, including the Mesopotamian An (\\"Heaven\\" itself), and Enlil and Enki/Marduk, the Vedic Indra and Mitra‚ÄìVaruna, the Zoroastrian Ahura Mazda, as well as the Dyeus of common Proto-Indo-European religion. Throughout the Chinese theological literary tradition, the Dipper constellations, and especially the Big Dipper ( Bƒõid«íuxƒ´ng, \\"Northern Dipper\\"), also known as Great Chariot, within Ursa Major, are portrayed as the potent symbol of spirit, divinity, or of the activity of the supreme God regulating nature. Examples include: D√¨ is literally a title expressing dominance over the all-under-Heaven, that is all created things. It is etymologically and figuratively analogous to the concept of di as the base of a fruit, which falls and produces other fruits. This analogy is attested in the Shuowen Jiezi explaining \\"deity\\" as \\"what faces the base of a melon fruit\\". TiƒÅn is usually translated as \\"Heaven\\", but by graphical etymology it means \\"Great One\\" and scholars relate it to the same D√¨ through phonetic etymology and trace their common root, through their archaic forms respectively *Tee≈ã and *Tees, to the symbols of the celestial pole and its spinning stars. Other words, such as d«êng (\\"on top\\", \\"apex\\") would share the same etymology, all connected to a conceptualisation‚Äîaccording to the scholar John C. Didier‚Äîof the north celestial pole godhead as cosmic square (Dƒ´ng Âè£). Zhou (2005) even connects D√¨, through Old Chinese *Tees and by phonetic etymology, to the Proto-Indo-European Dyeus. Medhurst (1847) also shows affinities in the usage of \\"deity\\", Chinese di, Greek theos and Latin deus, for incarnate powers resembling the supreme godhead. =Shang-Zhou theology= Ulrich Libbrecht distinguishes two layers in the development of early Chinese theology, traditions derived respectively from the Shang and subsequent Zhou dynasties. The religion of the Shang was based on the worship of ancestors and god-kings, who survived as unseen divine forces after death. They were not transcendent entities, since the cosmos was \\"by itself so\\", not created by a force outside of it but generated by internal rhythms and cosmic powers. The royal ancestors were called d√¨ (), \\"deities\\", and the utmost progenitor was Shangdi, identified as the dragon. Already in Shang theology, the multiplicity of gods of nature and ancestors were viewed as parts of Shangdi, and the four fƒÅng ( \\"directions\\" or \\"sides\\") and their fƒìng ( \\"winds\\") as his cosmic will. The Zhou dynasty, which overthrew the Shang, emphasised a more universal idea of Tian ( \\"Heaven\\"). The Shang dynasty's identification of Shangdi as their ancestor-god had asserted their claim to power by divine right; the Zhou transformed this claim into a legitimacy based on moral power, the Mandate of Heaven. In Zhou theology, Tian had no singular earthly progeny, but bestowed divine favour on virtuous rulers. Zhou kings declared that their victory over the Shang was because they were virtuous and loved their people, while the Shang were tyrants and thus were deprived of power by Tian. Cangnan, Wenzhou, Zhejiang. Tian TiƒÅn Â§© is both transcendent and immanent as the starry vault, manifesting in the three forms of dominance, destiny and nature. There are many compounds of the name Tian, and many of these clearly distinguish a \\"Heaven of dominance\\", a \\"Heaven of destiny\\" and a \\"Heaven of nature\\" as attributes of the supreme cosmic God. In the Wujing yiyi (, \\"Different Meanings in the Five Classics\\"), Xu Shen explains that the designation of Heaven is quintuple: * Hu√°ng TiƒÅn ‚Äî\\"Yellow Heaven\\" or \\"Shining Heaven\\", when it is venerated as the lord of creation; * H√†o TiƒÅn ‚Äî\\"Vast Heaven\\", with regard to the vastness of its vital breath (qi); * M√≠n TiƒÅn ‚Äî\\"Compassionate Heaven\\", for it hears and corresponds with justice to the all-under-Heaven; * Sh√†ng TiƒÅn ‚Äî\\"Highest Heaven\\" or \\"First Heaven\\", for it is the primordial being supervising all-under-Heaven; * CƒÅng TiƒÅn ‚Äî\\"Deep- Green Heaven\\", for it being unfathomably deep. Other names of the God of Heaven include: * TiƒÅnd√¨ ‚Äîthe \\"Deity of Heaven\\" or \\"Emperor of Heaven\\": \\"On Rectification\\" (Zheng lun) of the Xunzi uses this term to refer to the active God of Heaven setting in motion creation; * TiƒÅnzh«î ‚Äîthe \\"Lord of Heaven\\": In \\"The Document of Offering Sacrifices to Heaven and Earth on the Mountain Tai\\" (Fengshan shu) of the Records of the Grand Historian it is used as the title of the first God from whom all the other gods derive. * TiƒÅnhu√°ng ‚Äîthe \\"King of Heaven\\": In the \\"Poem of Fathoming Profundity\\" (Si'xuan fu), transcribed in \\"The History of the Later Han Dynasty\\" (Hou Han shu), Zhang Heng ornately writes: ¬´I ask the superintendent of the Heavenly Gate to open the door and let me visit the King of Heaven at the Jade Palace¬ª; * TiƒÅng≈çng ‚Äîthe \\"Duke of Heaven\\" or \\"General of Heaven\\"; * TiƒÅnj≈´n ‚Äîthe \\"Prince of Heaven\\" or \\"Lord of Heaven\\"; * TiƒÅnz≈´n ‚Äîthe \\"Heavenly Venerable\\", also a title for high gods in Taoist theologies; * TiƒÅnsh√©n ‚Äîthe \\"God of Heaven\\", interpreted in the Shuowen Jiezi as \\"the being that gives birth to all things\\"; * Sh√©nhu√°ng ‚Äî\\"God the King\\", attested in Taihong (\\"The Origin of Vital Breath\\"); * L«éotiƒÅny√© ()‚Äîthe \\"Olden Heavenly Father\\". Attributes of the supreme God of Heaven include: * TiƒÅnd√†o ‚Äî\\"Way of Heaven\\"; it is the God's will of power, which decides the development of things: The Book of Historical Documents says that ¬´the Way of Heaven is to bless the good, and make the bad miserable¬ª. It is also the name of some religious traditions; * TiƒÅnm√¨ng ‚Äî\\"Mandate of Heaven\\", defining the destiny of things; * TiƒÅny√¨ ‚Äî\\"Decree of Heaven\\", the same concept of destiny but implying an active decision; * TiƒÅnxi√† ‚Äî\\"Under Heaven\\"; means creation, ongoingly generated by the supreme God. Shangdi Sh√†ngd√¨ ( \\"Highest Deity\\"), sometimes shortened simply to D√¨ ( \\"Deity\\"), is another name of the supreme God inherited from Shang and Zhou times. The Classic of Poetry recites: ¬´How vast is the Highest Deity, the ruler of men below!¬ª. D√¨ is also applied to the name of cosmic gods besides the supreme godhead, and is used to compose titles of divinity; for instance D√¨j≈´n (\\"Divine Ruler\\", Latin: Dominus Deus), used in Taoism for high deities in the celestial hierarchy. In the Shang dynasty, as discussed by John C. Didier, Shangdi was the same as Dƒ´ng (, modern ), the \\"square\\" as the north celestial pole, and Sh√†ngji«é ( \\"Supreme Ancestor\\") was an alternative name. Shangdi was conceived as the utmost ancestor of the Shang royal lineage, the Zi () lineage, also called Ku (or Kui) or Diku (\\"Divus Ku\\"), attested in the Shiji and other texts. The other gods associated with the circumpolar stars were all embraced by Shangdi, and they were conceived as the ancestors of side noble lineages of the Shang and even non-Shang peripheral peoples who benefited from the identification of their ancestor-gods as part of Di. Together they were called xi√†d√¨, \\"lower deities\\" part of the \\"Highest Deity\\" of the Shang. With the supreme God identified as the pivot of the skies, all the lesser gods were its stars xƒ´ng, a word which in Shang script was illustrated by a few grouped dƒ´ng (cf. jƒ´ng , \\"perfect [celestial, i.e., star] light\\", and p«ên, originally \\"starlight\\"); up to the Han dynasty it was still common to represent the stars as small squares. The Shang conducted magnificent sacrifices to these ancestor-gods, whose altar mimicked the stars of the north celestial pole. Through this sympathetic magic, which consisted in reproducing the celestial centre on earth, the Shang established and monopolised the centralising political power. =Qin-Han theology= W«îfƒÅng Sh√†ngd√¨ ( \\"Five Forms of the Highest Deity\\") ‚Äî The order of Heaven inscribing worlds as t√°n , \\"altar\\", the Chinese concept equivalent to the Indian mandala. The supreme God conceptualised as the Yellow Deity, and Xuanyuan as its human form, is the heart of the universe and the other Four Deities are his emanations. The diagram is based on the Huainanzi. The emperors of the Qin dynasty (221‚Äì206 BCE) are credited with an effort to unify the cults of the W«îfƒÅng Sh√†ngd√¨ ( \\"Five Forms of the Highest Deity\\"), which were previously held at different locations, in single temple complexes. The Five Deities are a cosmological conception of the fivefold manifestation of the supreme God, or his five changing faces, that goes back to the Neolithic and continues in the classic texts. They \\"reflect the cosmic structure of the world\\" in which yin, yang and all forces are held in balance, and are associated with the four directions of space and the centre, the five sacred mountains, the five phases of creation, and the five constellations rotating around the celestial pole and five planets. During the Han dynasty (206 BCE‚Äì220 CE), the theology of the state religion developed side by side with the Huang‚ÄìLao religious movement which in turn influenced the early Taoist Church, and focused on a conceptualisation of the supreme God of the culmen of the sky as the Yellow God of the centre, and its human incarnation, the Yellow Emperor or Yellow Deity. Unlike previous Shang concepts of human incarnations of the supreme godhead, considered exclusively as the progenitors of the royal lineage, the Yellow Emperor was a more universal archetype of the human being. The competing factions of the Confucians and the fƒÅngsh√¨ ( \\"masters of directions\\"), regarded as representatives of the ancient religious tradition inherited from previous dynasties, concurred in the formulation of Han state religion. Taiyi T√†iyƒ´ (; also spelled T√†iy«ê or T√†iyƒ´; \\"Great Oneness\\" or \\"Great Unity\\"), also known as \\"Supreme Oneness of the Central Yellow\\" ( Zh≈çnghu√°ng T√†iy«ê), or the \\"Yellow God of the Northern Dipper\\" ( Hu√°ngsh√©n Bƒõid«íu), or \\"Heavenly Venerable Supreme Unity\\" ( T√†iyƒ´ TiƒÅnz≈´n), is a name of the supreme God of Heaven that had become prominent besides the older ones by the Han dynasty in relation with the figure of the Yellow Emperor. It harkens back to the Warring States period, as attested in the poem The Supreme Oneness Gives Birth to Water, and possibly to the Shang dynasty as D√†yƒ´ ( \\"Big Oneness\\"), an alternative name for the Shangs' (and universe's) foremost ancestor. Taiyi was worshipped by the social elites in the Warring States, and is also the first god described in the Nine Songs, shamanic hymns collected in the Chuci (\\"Songs of Chu\\"). Throughout the Qin and the Han dynasty, a distinction became evident between Taiyi as the supreme godhead identified with the northern culmen of the sky and its spinning stars, and a more abstract concept of Yƒ´ (‰∏Ä \\"One\\"), which begets the polar godhead and then the myriad beings; the more abstract Yi was an \\"interiorisation\\" of the supreme God which was influenced by the Confucian discourse. During the Han dynasty, Taiyi became part of the imperial cult, and at the same time it was the central concept of Huang‚ÄìLao, which influenced the early Taoist Church; in early Taoism, Taiyi was identifies as the D√†o . The \\"Inscription for Laozi\\" (Laozi ming), a Han stela, describes the Taiyi as the source of inspiration and immortality for Laozi. In Huang-Lao the philosopher-god Laozi was identified as the same as the Yellow Emperor, and received imperial sacrifices, for instance by Emperor Huan (146‚Äì168). In Han apocryphal texts, the Big Dipper is described as the instrument of Taiyi, the ladle from which he pours out the primordial breath (yuanqi), and as his heavenly chariot. A part of the Shiji by Sima Qian identifies Taiyi with the simple name Di (Deity) and tells: In 113 BCE, Emperor Wu of Han, under the influence of prominent fangshi‚ÄîMiu Ji and later Gongsun Qing‚Äî, officially integrated the Huang‚ÄìLao theology of Taiyi with the Confucian state religion and theology of the Five Forms of the Highest Deity inherited from the erstwhile dynasties. Huangdi Jinyun, Lishui, Zhejiang. Pu, Linfen, Shanxi. In the oldest accounts, he is one and the same with the Yellow Emperor. Hu√°ngd√¨ ( \\"Yellow Emperor\\" or \\"Yellow Deity\\") is another name of the God of Heaven, associated with the celestial pole and with the power of the wu (shamans). In the older cosmological tradition of the Wufang Shangdi, the Yellow Deity is the main one, associated with the centre of the cosmos. He is also called Hu√°ngsh√©n (\\"Yellow God\\"), XuƒÅnyu√°n ( \\"Chariot Shaft\\" p. 117, note 11.), which is said to have been his personal name as a human incarnation, XuƒÅnyu√°nsh√¨ ( \\"Master of the Chariot Shaft\\") or Xuanyuan Huangdi (\\"Yellow Deity of the Chariot Shaft\\"). In Chinese religion he is the deity who shapes the material world ( D√¨), the creator of the Huaxia civilisation, of marriage and morality, language and lineage, and progenitor of all Chinese. In the cosmology of the Wufang Shangdi his astral body is Saturn, but he is also identified as the Sun God, and with the star Regulus (Œ± Leonis) and constellations Leo and Lynx, of which the latter is said to represent the body of the Yellow Dragon, his serpentine form. The character hu√°ng, for \\"yellow\\", also means, by homophony and shared etymology with hu√°ng, \\"august\\", \\"creator\\" and \\"radiant\\", attributes of the supreme God. As a progenitor, Huangdi is portrayed as the historical incarnation of the Yellow God of the Northern Dipper. According to a definition given by apocryphal texts related to the H√©t√∫ , the Yellow Emperor \\"proceeds from the essence of the Yellow God of the Northern Dipper\\", is born to \\"a daughter of a chthonic deity\\", and as such he is \\"a cosmic product of the conflation of Heaven and Earth\\". As a human being, the Yellow Emperor was conceived by a virgin mother, Fubao, who was impregnated by Taiyi's radiance (yuanqi, \\"primordial pneuma\\"), a lightning, which she saw encircling the Northern Dipper (Great Chariot, or broader Ursa Major), or the celestial pole, while walking in the countryside. She delivered her son after twenty-four months on the mount of Shou (Longevity) or mount Xuanyuan, after which he was named. pp. 241, 246. Through his human side, he was a descendant of Y«íuxi√≥ng, the lineage of the Bear‚Äîanother reference to the Ursa Major. Didier has studied the parallels that the Yellow Emperor's mythology has in other cultures, deducing a plausible ancient origin of the myth in Siberia or in north Asia. In older accounts, the Yellow Emperor is identified as a deity of light (and his name is explained in the Shuowen Jiezi to derive from guƒÅng , \\"light\\") and thunder, and as one and the same with the \\"Thunder God\\" ( L√©ish√©n), p. 239: in the Hetudijitong and the Chunqiuhechengtu the Yellow Emperor is identified as the Thunder God. p. 138. who in turn, as a later mythological character, is distinguished as the Yellow Emperor's foremost pupil, such as in the Huangdi Neijing. As the deity of the centre, the Yellow Emperor is the Zhongyuedadi ( \\"Great Deity of the Central Peak\\") and he represents the essence of earth and the Yellow Dragon. He represents the hub of creation, the axis mundi (Kunlun) that is the manifestation of the divine order in physical reality, opening the way to immortality. As the centre of the four directions, in the Shizi he is described as \\"Yellow Emperor with Four Faces\\" ( Hu√°ngd√¨ S√¨mi√†n). The \\"Four-Faced God\\" or \\"Ubiquitous God\\" ( S√¨mi√†nsh√©n) is also the Chinese name of Brahma. Huangdi is the model of those who merge their self with the self of the supreme God, of the ascetics who reach enlightenment or immortality. He is the god of nobility, the patron of Taoism and medicine. In the Shiji, as well as in the Taoist book Zhuangzi, he is also described as the perfect king. There are records of dialogues in which Huangdi took the advice of wise counselors, contained in the Huangdi Neijing (\\"Inner Scripture of the Yellow Emperor\\") as well as in the Shiwen (\\"Ten Questions\\"). In the Huang‚ÄìLao tradition he is the model of a king turned immortal, and is associated with the transmission of various mantic and medical techniques. Besides the Inner Scripture of the Yellow Emperor, Huangdi is also associated to other textual bodies of knowledge including the Huangdi Sijing (\\"Four Scriptures of the Yellow Emperor\\") and the (\\"Scripture of the Dwellings of the Yellow Emperor\\"). In the cosmology of the Wufang Shangdi, besides the Yellow Deity, the Black Deity ( Hƒìid√¨) of the north, winter and Mercury, is portrayed by Sima Qian as Huangdi's grandson, and is himself associated with the north pole stars. The \\"Green Deity\\" or \\"Blue Deity\\" ( CƒÅngd√¨ or Qƒ´ngd√¨), of the east, spring, and identified with Jupiter, is frequently worshipped as the supreme God and its main temple at Mount Tai (the cult centre of all Eastern Peak Temples) is attested as a site for fire sacrifices to the supreme God since prehistoric times. =Yudi= Temple of the Jade Deity in Tianjin. Y√πd√¨ ( \\"Jade Deity\\" or \\"Jade Emperor\\"), or Y√πhu√°ng ( \\"Jade King\\"), is a personification of the supreme God of Heaven in popular religion. More elaborate names for the Jade Deity include Y√πhu√°ng Sh√†ngd√¨ ( \\"Highest Deity the Jade King\\") and Y√πhu√°ngd√†d√¨ ( \\"Great Deity the Jade King\\"), while among the common people he is intimately referred to as the \\"Lord of Heaven\\" ( TiƒÅng≈çng). He is also present in Taoist theology, where, however, he is not regarded as the supreme principle though he has a high position in the pantheon. In Taoism his formal title is the \\"Most Honourable Great Deity the Jade King in the Golden Tower of the Clear Heaven\\" (H√†otiƒÅn Jƒ´nquƒì Zh√¨z≈´n Y√πhu√°ngd√†d√¨ ), and he is one of the Four Sovereigns, the four deities proceeding directly from the Three Pure Ones, which in Taoism are the representation of the supreme principle. The eminence of the Jade Deity is relatively recent, emerging in popular religion during the Tang dynasty (618‚Äì907) and becoming established during the Song dynasty (960‚Äì1279), especially under Emperor Zhenzong and Emperor Huizong of Song. By the Tang dynasty the name of \\"Jade King\\" had been widely adopted by the common people to refer to the God of Heaven, and this got the attention of the Taoists who integrated the deity in their pantheon. The cult of the Jade Deity became so widespread that during the Song dynasty it was proclaimed by imperial decree that this popular conception of God was the same supreme God of Heaven whom the elites had the privilege to worship at the Temple of Heaven. There are a great number of temples in China dedicated to the Jade Deity ( y√πhu√°ngmi√†o or y√πhu√°ngg√©, et al.), and his birthday on the 9th day of the first month of the Chinese calendar is one of the biggest festivals. He is also celebrated on the 25th day of the 12th month, when he is believed to turn to the human world to inspect all goods and evils to determine awards or punishments. In everyday language the Jade Deity is also called the Olden Heavenly Father (L«éotiƒÅny√© ) and simply Heaven. =Taidi= T√†id√¨ ( \\"Utmost Deity\\" or \\"Great Deity\\"), is another name that has been used to describe the supreme God in some contexts. It appears in the mystical narratives of the Huainanzi where the supreme God is associated to the Mount Kunlun, the axis mundi. =Shen= Sh√©n is a general concept meaning \\"spirit\\", and usually defines the plurality of gods in the world, however in certain contexts it has been used as singular denoting the supreme God, the \\"being that gives birth to all things\\". Concepts including shen expressing the idea of the supreme God include: * TiƒÅnsh√©n , the \\"God of Heaven\\", interpreted in the Shuowen Jiezi () as \\"the being that gives birth to all things\\"; * Sh√©nhu√°ng , \\"God the King\\", attested in Taihong (\\"The Origin of Vital Breath\\"). Sh√©nd√†o ( \\"Way of the God[s]\\"), in the Yijing, is the path or way of manifestation of the supreme God and the gods of nature. Since the Qin and Han dynasty, \\"Shendao\\" became a descriptor for the \\"Chinese religion\\" as the sh√®ji√†o , \\"social religion\\" of the nation. The phrase Sh√©nd√†o sh√®ji√†o () literally means \\"established religion of the way of the gods\\". =Zi= Ouhai, Wenzhou, Zhejiang. The facade of the left side building features the modern stylisation of the l√π / zi symbol ‚Üí 20px. Zi , literally meaning \\"son\\", \\"(male) offspring\\", is another concept associated to the supreme God of Heaven as the north celestial pole and its spinning stars. Z√¨ , meaning \\"word\\" and \\"symbol\\", is one of its near homophonous and graphic cognates. It was the surname used by the royal lineage of the Shang dynasty. It is a component of concepts including TiƒÅnz«ê (\\"Son of Heaven\\") and j≈´nz«ê (\\"son of a lord\\", which in Confucianism became the concept of morally perfected person). According to Didier, in Shang and Zhou forms, the grapheme zi itself depicts someone linked to the godhead of the squared north celestial pole ( Dƒ´ng), and is related to zh≈çng, the concept of spiritual and thus political centrality. In modern Chinese popular religion zi is a synonym of l√π (\\"prosperity\\", \\"furthering\\", \\"welfare\\"). L√πxƒ´ng ( \\"Star of Prosperity\\") is Mizar, a star of the Big Dipper (Great Chariot) constellation which rotates around the north celestial pole; it is the second star of the \\"handle\\" of the Dipper. Luxing is conceived as a member of two clusters of gods, the SƒÅnxƒ´ng ( \\"Three Stars\\") and the Ji«îhu√°ngsh√©n ( \\"Nine God-Kings\\"). The latter are the seven stars of the Big Dipper with the addition of two less visible ones thwartwise the \\"handle\\", and they are conceived as the ninefold manifestation of the supreme God of Heaven, which in this tradition is called Ji«îhu√°ngd√†d√¨ (, \\"Great Deity of the Nine Kings\\"), p. 19. Xu√°ntiƒÅn Sh√†ngd√¨ ( \\"Highest Deity of the Dark Heaven\\"), or D√≤uf√π ( \\"Father of the Chariot\\"). The number nine is for this reason associated with the yang masculine power of the dragon, and celebrated in the Double Ninth Festival and Nine God-Kings Festival. The Big Dipper is the expansion of the supreme principle, governing waxing and life (yang), while the Little Dipper is its reabsorption, governing waning and death (yin). The mother of the Jiuhuangshen is D«íum«î ( \\"Mother of the Chariot\\"), the female aspect of the supreme. Theology of the schools As explained by Stephan Feuchtwang, the fundamental difference between Confucianism and Taoism lies in the fact that the former focuses on the realisation of the starry order of Heaven in human society, while the latter on the contemplation of the Dao which spontaneously arises in nature. Taoism also focuses on the cultivation of local gods, to centre the order of Heaven upon a particular locality. =Confucian theology= Worship at the Great Temple of Lord Zhang Hui ( ZhƒÅng Huƒ´ g≈çng d√†di√†n), the cathedral ancestral shrine of the Zhang lineage corporation, at their ancestral home in Qinghe, Hebei. Confucius (551‚Äì479 BCE) emerged in the critical Warring States period as a reformer of the religious tradition inherited from the Shang and Zhou dynasties. His elaboration of ancient theology gives centrality to self- cultivation and human agency, and to the educational power of the self- established individual in assisting others to establish themselves (the principle of √†ir√©n, \\"loving others\\"). Philosophers in the Warring States compiled in the Analects, and formulated the classic metaphysics which became the lash of Confucianism. In accordance with the Master, they identified mental tranquility as the state of Tian, or the One (‰∏Ä Yƒ´), which in each individual is the Heaven-bestowed divine power to rule one's own life and the world. Going beyond the Master, they theorised the oneness of production and reabsorption into the cosmic source, and the possibility to understand and therefore reattain it through meditation. This line of thought would have influenced all Chinese individual and collective-political mystical theories and practices thereafter. Fu Pei-Jun characterises the Heaven of ancient Confucianism, before the Qin dynasty, as \\"dominator\\", \\"creator\\", \\"sustainer\\", \\"revealer\\" and \\"judge\\". The Han-dynasty Confucian scholar Dong Zhongshu (179‚Äì104 BCE) described Heaven as \\"the supreme God possessing a will\\". In the Song dynasty, Neo-Confucianism, especially the major exponent Zhu Xi (1130‚Äì1200), generally rationalised the theology, cosmology and ontology inherited from the foregoing tradition. Neo-Confucian thinkers reaffirmed the unity of the \\"heavenly city\\" and the earthly \\"divine city\\"; the city that the God of Heaven morally organises in the natural world through humanity is not ontologically separate from Heaven itself, so that the compound \\"Heaven-Earth\\" ( TiƒÅnd√¨) is another name of the God of Heaven itself in Neo-Confucian texts. Heaven contains Earth as part of its nature, and the myriad things are begotten (Áîü shƒìng) by Heaven and raised up ( y«éng) by Earth. Neo-Confucians also discussed Heaven under the term T√†ij√≠ (\\"Great Pole\\"). Stephan Feuchtwang says that Confucianism consists in the search for \\"middle ways\\" between yin and yang in each new configuration of the world, to align reality with Heaven through rites. The order of Heaven is emphasised; it is a moral power and fully realises in patriarchy, that is to say the worship of progenitors, in the Han tradition in the male line, who are considered to have embodied Heaven. This conception is put into practice as the religious worship of progenitors in the system of ancestral shrines, dedicated to the deified progenitors of lineages (groups of families sharing the same surname). The philosopher Promise Hsu identifies Tian as the foundation of a civil theology of China. Three models Huang Yong (2007) has discerned three models of theology in the Confucian tradition: * (i) Theology of Heaven as discussed in the Confucian canonical texts, the Classic of History, the Classic of Poetry and the Analects of Confucius, as a transcendent God similar to the God of the Hellenistic and Abrahamic traditions; * (ii) Theology of Heaven in contemporary New Confucianism, represented especially by Xiong Shili, Mou Zongsan, and Tu Weiming, as an \\"immanently transcendent\\" God, the ultimate reality immanent in the world to transcend the world; * (iii) Theology of Heaven in Neo-Confucianism, particularly the Cheng brothers in the Song dynasty, as the wonderful life-giving activity transcending the world within the world. =Canonical theology= The supreme power in Confucianism is Tian, Shangdi or Di in the early or classic Confucian tradition, later also discussed in its activity as TiƒÅnl«ê or TiƒÅnd√†o, the \\"Order of Heaven\\" or \\"Way of Heaven\\" by Neo-Confucians. A number of scholars support the theistic reading of early Confucian texts. In the Analects Heaven is treated as a conscious and providential being concerned not only with the human order in general, but with Confucius' own mission in particular. Confucius claimed to be a transmitter of an ancient knowledge rather than a renovator. In Confucianism, God has not created man in order to neglect him, but is always with man, and sustains the order of nature and human society, by teaching rulers how to be good to secure the peace of the countries. The theistic idea of early Confucianism gave later way to a depersonalisation of Heaven, identifying it as the pattern discernible in the unfolding of nature and his will (Tianming) as peoples' consensus, culminating in the Mencius and the Xunzi. =Immanent transcendence= Contemporary New Confucian theologians have resolved the ancient dispute between the theistic and nontheistic, immanent and transcendent interpretations of Tian, elaborating the concept of \\"immanent transcendence\\" ( n√®iz√†i chƒÅoyu√®), contrasting it with the \\"external transcendence\\" ( w√†iz√†i chƒÅoyu√®) of the God of Christianity. While the God of the Christians is outside the world that he creates, the God of the Confucians is immanent in the world to call for the transcendence of the given situation, thus promoting an ongoing transformation. The first theologian to discuss immanent transcendence was Xiong Shili. According to him, noumenon ( t«ê) and phenomenon ( y√≤ng) are not separate, but the noumenon is right within the phenomenon. At the same time, the noumenon is also transcendent, not in the sense that it has independent existence, separated from the \\"ten thousand things\\", but in the sense that it is the substance of all things. As the substance, it is transcendent because it is not transformed by the ten thousand things but is rather their master: it \\"transcends the surface of things\\". By transcending the surface, one realises the self-nature ( z√¨ x√¨ng sh√©n) of himself and of all things; to the extent that a thing has not fully realised its own self-nature, God is also that on which any particular thing or human being depends ( yƒ´ tƒÅ sh√©n). According to the further explanations of Xiong's student Mou Zongsan, Heaven is not merely the sky, and just like the God of the Judaic and Hellenistic-Christian tradition, it is not one of the beings in the world. However, unlike the God of Western religions, the God of Confucianism is not outside the world either, but is within humans‚Äîwho are the primary concern of Confucianism‚Äîand within other beings in the world. Tian is the ontological substance of reality, it is immanent in every human being as the human nature (ren); however, the human being on the phenomenal level is not identical with its metaphysical essence. Mencius stated that ¬´the one who can fully realise one's heart‚Äìmind can understand one's nature, and the one who can understand one's own nature can know Tian¬ª. This means that Tian is within the human being, but before this last comes to realise his true heart‚Äìmind, or know his true nature, Heaven still appears transcendent to him. Mou cites Max Muller saying that ¬´a human being itself is potentially a God, a God one presently ought to become¬ª, to explain the idea of the relationship of God and humanity in Confucianism and other Eastern religions. What is crucial is to transcend the phenomenon to reach Tian. Mou makes an important distinction between Confucianism and Christianity: the latter does not ask one to become a Christ, because the nature of Christ is unreachable for ordinary humans, who are not conceived as having a divine essence; by contrast, in Confucianism, sages who have realised Tian teach to others how to become sages and worthy themselves, since Heaven is present in everyone and may be cultivated. Mou defines Confucianism as a \\"religion of morality\\", a religion of the \\"fulfillment of virtues\\", whose meaning lies in seeking the infinite and the complete in the finitude of earthly life. Tu Weiming, a student of Mou, furtherly develops the theology of \\"immanent transcendence\\". By his own words: According to Tu, the more man may penetrate his own inner source, the more he may transcend himself. By the metaphorical words of Mencius (7a29), this process is like \\"digging a well to reach the source of water\\". It is for this emphasis on transcending the phenomena to reach the true self, which is the divine, that Tu defines Confucian religiosity as the \\"ultimate self- transformation as a communal act and as a faithful dialogical response to the transcendent\\"; Confucianism is about developing the nature of humanity in the right, harmonious way. Tu further explains this as a prognosis and diagnosis of humanity: \\"we are not what we ought to be but what we ought to be is inherent in the structure of what we are\\". Heaven bids and impels humans to realise their true self. Humans have the inborn ability to respond to Heaven. One may obtain knowledge of divinity through his inner experience (tizhi), and knowledge, developing his heavenly virtue. This is a central concern of Tu's theology, at the same time intellectual and affectional‚Äîa question of mind and heart at the same time. =Theology of activity= Huang Yong has named a third approach to Confucian theology interpreting the Neo-Confucianism of the brothers Cheng Hao (1032‚Äì1085) and Cheng Yi (1033‚Äì1107). Instead of regarding the divinity of Tian as a substance, this theology emphasises its creative \\"life-giving activity\\" (Áîü shƒìng) that is within the world in order to transcend the world itself. Also in the works of Zhou Xi, Heaven is discussed as always operating within beings in conjunction with their singular ÂøÉ xƒ´n (\\"heart‚Äìmind\\"). Neo-Confucians incorporated in Confucianism the discussion about the traditional concept of L«ê, variously translated as \\"form\\", \\"law\\", \\"reason\\", \\"order\\", \\"pattern\\", \\"organism\\", and most commonly \\"principle\\", regarding it as the supreme principle of the cosmos. The Chengs use Li interchangeably with other terms. For instance, discussing the supreme principle, Cheng Hao says that it \\"is called change ( y√¨) with respect to its reality; is called d√†o with respect to its li; is called divinity ( sh√©n) with respect to its function; and is called nature ( x√¨ng) with respect to it as the destiny in a person\\". Cheng Yi also states that the supreme principle \\"with respect to li it is called Heaven ( TiƒÅn); with the respect to endowment, it is called nature, and with the respect to its being in a person, it is called heart‚Äìmind\\". As it appears from these analogies, the Li is considered by the Chengs as identical with Heaven. By the words of the Chengs, Huang clarifies the immanent transcendence of the Li, since it comes ontologically before things but it does not exist outside of things, or outside qi, the energy‚Äìmatter of which things are made. In Chengs' theology the Li is not some entity but the \\"activity\\" of things, sheng. Explaining it through an analogy, according to the Shuowen Jiezi, Li is originally a verb meaning to work on jade. The Chengs further identify this activity as the true human nature. Sages, who have realised the true nature, are identical with the Li and their actions are identical to the creativity of the Li. Generally, in Confucian texts, g≈çng (\\"work\\", \\"work of merit\\" or \\"beneficial work\\") and d√© (\\"virtue\\") are frequently used to refer to the ways of becoming an honourable man of Heaven, and thus they may be regarded as attributes of Heaven itself. Zhu Xi himself characterises Heaven as extremely \\"active\\" or \\"vital\\" (ji√†n ), while the Earth is responsive ( sh√πn). Humanity as the incarnation of Heaven The relationship \\"between Heaven and mankind\\" (tiƒÅnr√©nzhƒ´j√¨ ), that is to say how Heaven generates men and how they should behave to follow its order, is a common theme discussed in the Confucian theology of Heaven. Generally, Confucianism sees humanity, or the form-quality of the human being, r√©n (translatable as \\"benevolence\\", \\"love\\", \\"humanity\\"), as a quality of the God of Heaven itself, and therefore it sees humanity as an incarnation of Heaven. This theory is not at odds with the classical non-Confucian theology which views Huangdi as the incarnated God of Heaven, since Huangdi is a representation of nobility and the pursuit of Confucianism is to make all humans noble (j≈´nz«ê ) or sages and holy men ( sh√®ngr√©n). According to Benjamin I. Schwartz, in the Xunzi it is explained that: p. 209. Cites: In the \\"Interactions Between Heaven and Mankind\\" ( TiƒÅnr√©n G«ény√¨ng) written by the Han-dynasty scholar Dong Zhongshu, humanity is discussed as the incarnation of Heaven. Human physiological structure, thought, emotions and moral character are all modelled after Heaven. In the Confucian discourse, ancestors who accomplished great actions are regarded as the incarnation of Heaven, and they last as a form shaping their descendants. R√©n is the virtue endowed by Heaven and at the same time the means by which man may comprehend his divine nature and achieve oneness with Heaven. Discourse about evil, suffering and world renewal In Confucian theology there is no original sin, and rather humanity, as the incarnate image of Heaven's virtue, is born good ( li√°ngx√≠n, \\"good heart‚Äìmind\\"). In Confucian theodicy, the rise of evil in a given cosmic configuration is attributed to failings in the moral organisation of qi, which depends on mankind's (or the \\"practising subject\\", sh√≠ji√†n zh«ît«ê , in Zhu Xi) free will, that is to say the ability to choose whether to harmonise or not with the order of Heaven, which is part of the creature's ability to co-create with the creator. Paraphrasing Zhu Xi: Human qi, the primordial potential substance, organises according to the yin and yang polarity in the two facets of x√≠ng (\\"body\\") and sh√©n (\\"soul\\"). Qi is open to both disorder (yin) and order (yang), bodily and heavenly appetites. While other creatures have a limited perfection, the human being alone has an \\"unlimited nature\\", that is to say the ability to cultivate its qi in amounts and directions of its own choice, either yin or yang. While Confucians prescribe to be moderate in pursuing appetites, since even the bodily ones are necessary for life, when the \\"proprietorship of corporeality\\" (x√≠ngq√¨ zhƒ´sƒ´ ) prevails, selfishness and therefore immorality ensue. When evil dominates, the world falls into disaster, society shatters up and individuals are hit by diseases, giving the way for a new heavenly configuration to emerge. By the words of Zhu Xi: Sufferings, however, are also regarded by Confucians as a way of Heaven to refine a person preparing him for a future role. According to Mencius: Likewise, Zhu Xi says: =Taoist theology= Guandi () of Qiqihar, Heilongjiang. Altar to Shangdi and Doumu ( \\"Mother of the Chariot\\"), representing the originating principle of the universe in masculine and feminine form, in the Chengxu Temple of Zhouzhuang, Jiangxi. Religious traditions under the label of \\"Taoism\\" have their own theologies which, characterised by henotheism, are meant to accommodate local deities in the Taoist celestial hierarchy. According to Stephan Feuchtwang, Taoism is concerned with the cultivation of local deities bringing them in alignment with the broader cosmology, in order to \\"centre\\" through the power of rite each locality with its peculiarities. It has hermetic and lay liturgical traditions, the most practised at the popular level being those for healing and exorcism, codified into a textual corpus commissioned and approved by emperors throughout the dynasties, the Taoist Canon. The core of Taoist theology is the concept of D√†o , the \\"Way\\", which is both the order of nature and the source of it. Differently from common religion or even Confucianism, Taoism espouses a negative theology declaring the impossibility to define the Dao. The core text of Taoism, the Daodejing, opens with the verses: ¬´The Dao that can be said is not the eternal Dao, the name that can be said is not the eternal name¬ª. Feuchtwang explains the Dao as equivalent to the ancient Greek conception of physis, that is \\"nature\\" as the generation and regeneration of beings. Taoists seek \\"perfection\\", which is immortality, achieved by becoming one with the Dao, or the rhythms of nature. Through time Taoist Theology created its own deities. Similar to deities of Hinduistic and Yoruban beliefs these deities attributed certain qualities. Certain sects modeled their temples to dedicate to certain deities. Deities who take part in the Dao are arranged in a hierarchy. The supreme powers are three, the Three Pure Ones, and represent the centre of the cosmos and its two modalities of manifestation (yin and yang). The hierarchy of the highest powers of the cosmos is arranged as follows: * SƒÅnqƒ´ng ‚Äî Three Pure Ones: ** \\"Jade Purity\\" Y√πqƒ´ng, \\"Heavenly Honourable of the First Beginning\\" Yu√°nsh«ê TiƒÅnz≈´n; ** \\"High Purity\\" Sh√†ngqƒ´ng, \\"Heavenly Honourable of the Numinous Treasure\\" L√≠ngb«éo TiƒÅnz≈´n; ** \\"Supreme Purity\\" T√†iqƒ´ng, \\"Heavenly Honourable of the Way and its Virtue\\" D√†od√© TiƒÅnz≈´n, incarnated historically as Laozi. * S√¨y√π ‚Äî Four Sovereigns: ** H√†otiƒÅn Jƒ´nquƒì Zh√¨z≈´n Y√πhu√°ng D√†d√¨ ‚Äî Most Honourable Great Deity the Jade King in the Golden Tower of the Clear Heaven ** Zh≈çngtiƒÅn Z«êwƒìi Bƒõij√≠ D√†d√¨ ‚Äî Great Deity of the Purple Subtlety of the North Star at the Heart of Heaven ** G≈çuch√©n Sh√†ngg≈çng TiƒÅnhu√°ng D√†d√¨ ‚Äî Great Deity the Heavenly King in the High Palace at the Old Hook ** Ch√©ngtiƒÅn Xi√†of«é T«îhu√°ng Deq√≠ ‚Äî Land Appeasing Soil Ruler who Imitates the Law which Sustains Heaven, is goddess Houtu Trends in modern Chinese political and civil theology the Yellow Deity and the Red Deity carved in the rock at a ceremonial complex in Zhengzhou, Henan. Interest in traditional Chinese theology has waxed and waned throughout the dynasties of the history of China. For instance, the Great Leap Forward enacted in the mid-20th century involved the outright destruction of traditional temples in accordance with Maoist ideology. From the 1980s onwards a revival has taken place, with public sacrifices held at temples meant to renew the perceived alliance between community leaders and the gods. In the 2010s, \\"the great majority of China's population of 1.3+ billion\\" takes part in Chinese cosmological religion, its rituals and festivals of the lunar calendar. The cult of the Yellow Emperor is celebrated officially by the contemporary Chinese government. Even Chinese Buddhism, a religion which originally came from abroad, adapted to common Chinese cosmology by paralleling its concept of a triune supreme with Shakyamuni, Amithaba and Maitreya, representing respectively enlightenment, salvation and post- apocalyptic paradise. The TathƒÅtƒÅ ( zhƒìnr√∫, \\"suchness\\") is generally identified as the supreme being itself. In the wake of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, many scholars understand Confucian theology as a natural theology. The Chinese theological conception of the God of Heaven's ongoing self- creation/evolution in the \\"divine city\\" and the broader cosmos is contrasted with that of God as a craftsman external to his creation which is the type of theism of Christianity. Contemporary scholars also compare Confucianism and Christianity on the matters of humanity's good nature and of pneumatology, that is to say the respective doctrines of the shen dynamism produced by God's activity (guishen) and of the Holy Spirit, finding that the Confucian doctrine is truly humanistic since the spirit is the creative dynamism always present in humanity, while in the Christian doctrine the Holy Spirit ultimately belongs to God alone. According to the philosopher Promise Hsu, in the wake of Eric Voegelin, while Christianity fails to provide a public, civil theology, Confucianism with its idea of Tian, within broader Chinese cosmological religion, is particularly apt to fill the void left by the failing of Christianity. Paraphrasing Varro, Hsu says: Quoting from Ellis Sandoz's works, Hsu says: Also Jo√´l Thoraval characterises the common Chinese religion, or what he calls a \\"popular Confucianism\\", which has powerfully revived since the 1980s, consisting in the widespread belief and worship of five cosmological entities‚ÄîHeaven and Earth (Di ), the sovereign or the government (j≈´n ), ancestors (qƒ´n ) and masters (shƒ´ )‚Äî, as China's civil religion.

She has freelanced for publications like Outlook Traveller, Manorama Year Book and Kerala Calling, among others.  Butterfingers  The Butterfinger series revolves around the hilarious escapades of thirteen-year-old Amar Kishen, a class VIII student of the fictitious Green Park Higher Secondary School. Amar's slip-grip methods and his clumsy antics earned him the nickname Butterfingers. Butterfingers, named after Khyrunnisa's son, Amar, first appeared in 2006 in Tinkle, a popular fortnightly Indian children's magazine, as a regular comic-strip character. The illustrations were by Abhijeet Kini, the Mumbai-based illustrator and graphic artist. The popular Butterfingers series, published by Puffin, began with the novel, Howzzat Butterfingers! , In 2010. This humorous cricket-based book was followed in 2012 by Goal, Butterfingers!, a rollicking football-based adventure novel which also includes a socially relevant environmental theme. The third in the series, ‚ÄòClean Bowled, Butterfingers! was published in 2015 and is another cricket-based novel with a hilariously farcical plot in which Amar and his friends invent a variation of cricket called ‚ÄòCrack It‚Äô when the school‚Äôs cricket gear gets stolen. This game, played without cricket bats and balls, has its own absurd rules and generates immense fun. The Misadventures of Butterfingers, the fourth book in the series, came out in 2016 and is a collection of short stories. It was followed by two collections of delightful short stories, Run! It's Butterfingers Again! in 2017 and Of Course It's Butterfingers! in 2018. The books have received praise from different quarters.

It brings back memories of my prep school days.‚Äô The ace cricketer V.V.S. Laxman described Clean Bowled Butterfingers as an ‚Äòexuberant mix of school, cricket and fun.‚Äô Shashi Tharoor, writer, MP and diplomat, complimented Khyrunnisa ‚Äònot just for creating Butterfingers, but for enriching Indian writing with world-class children‚Äôs literature.‚Äô He also said that ‚ÄòKhyrunnisa's Butterfingers is a gift to the children of our nation!'

He would probably have been a tribune of the plebs, but in the better manuscripts, his name is given as Maenius, and he might be the same person as Gaius Maenius, tribune of the plebs in 483.Macrobius, i. 11.Livy, ii. 36.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. II, p. 896 (\\"Maenius\\", no. 1). * Marcus Maevius, a military tribune, who fell in battle against Mago in 203 BC, during the Second Punic War; possibly should be Maenius.Livy, xxx. 18.Broughton, vol.

He is said to have written on the spendthrift son of the tragedian Clodius Aesopus. Either he or his cohort, Marcus Bavius, is thought to have written the Antibucolica, two pastoral poems written as parodies of Vergil's Eclogues, or Bucolica.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol.

The first Congress of Honduras, a constituent assembly convened on 16 September 1824, and effected the union of Comayagua and Tegucigalpa, declaring them alternate capitals of Honduras, and chose Dionisio de Herrera as First Chief of the State of Honduras, with Lieutenant General Jos√© Justo Milla as his deputy. At the time Honduras was part of the short-lived Federal Republic of Central America, established in 1823. The first constitution of Honduras, dated 11 December 1825, established four-year terms for the head of state, with Herrera's initial term to end on 16 September 1827. He was however unable to finish his term due to a coup d'√©tat. The assembly took the position that his position was provisional. Background The president of the Federal Republic of Central America, Manuel Jos√© Arce, opposed Herrera and the Liberal Party of Honduras. In October 1826 Arce dissolved Congress and the Senate, trying establish a centralist or unitary system, allying himself with the conservatives, by which he lost the support of his own party, the liberals. This brought him into conflict with both the federal government and the states, denounced by Herrera and Mariano Prado, Chief of State of El Salvador. On 1 November 1826 Herrera was attacked in his house; hired men fired from the street into his bedroom. In December of 1826 the conservative priest excommunicated Herrera, claiming that he was influenced by freemasons and heretics. Coup d'√©tat Arce called on the Honduran army commanded by the deputy chief of state, Jos√© Justo Milla Pineda, to support Ir√≠as. On 4 April 1827 the siege of Comayagua began. On 10 May, after 36 days, the square was surrendered by the military chief Fern√°ndez. Aftermath Herrera was taken prisoner May 9, and sent to Guatemala, where he remained in prison for two years. On 15 March 1829 General Francisco Moraz√°n and his army were intercepted by the federal troops of Colonel Prado in Las Charcas. Moraz√°n held a superior position and crushed Prado's army. Later, Moraz√°n moved to recover his former positions in P√≠nula and Aceytuno, putting him once more in control of Guatemala City, where he finally freed Herrera.

Building history The building was built in the 1940s as the Hotel Panamericano, that for some time was the most important hotel in the capital of Tegucigalpa, Honduras. As a hotel, it lodged diplomats and other important people for a long time. During the 1950s and 1960s, the building housed some of the medical and chemistry departments of UNAH. It was from inside this building that the fight for UNAH to become an independent university was developed, which occurred on 15 October 1957. With the construction of the University City in the zone of the Aldea of Suyapa at the end of the 1960s, the university activity gradually moved to the new space, and the building would become the headquarters of the Ministry of Work until 1998, when it was damaged by Hurricane Mitch, and then abandoned. Abandonment After 12 years of being abandoned, there was serious damage throughout the building, as part of its roof was missing, with leaks and damages on the second and third floors. The flood, paired with being abandoned soon after, allowed a full water pit to form at the base of the building. Along with other leaks, this put the building's foundation in danger. The lack of maintenance allowed cracks, fissures, and the growing of parasitic plants to develop. There was also a fair amount of vandalism on the walls, and the building has been used as a garbage dump and toilet.  Restoration  Julieta Castellanos' administration began an initiative to solve the legal situation of the property. It was decided to use the building as a tculturayen spcand create the Center for Art and Culture (CAC). The project was bid for in December 2010, and the restoration work began in March 2011 with a maximum investment cost of 28 million lempiras. The restoration conserved the fa√ßades and the formal original style of the building. The basic guideleines for the restoration respected the parameters established by the Letter of Venecia for buildings that have been declared national heritage sites. The restoration's goals were to conserve and reveal the aesthetic and historical values of the building, based on respecting its historical essence, accompanied with an archaeologic and historical study of the building. In the architectural plan, the restorations respected the authentic documents about the original structure of the building regarding its aesthetic and compositional techniques.  Inauguration  The Center was inaugurated on 15 October 2012, coinciding with the 165th anniversary of the founding of UNAH, and the success of the University as the largest place of study in the country, on 15 October 1957. The Center created its exhibition rooms as spaces for pieces and collections pertaining to cultural heritage, and many of these are an inherent part of the institution's history: foundational objects that belonged to the first moments of the university's history. Other pieces are priceless samples of the cultural Honduran heritage, among them Prehispanic pieces donated to UNAH by the Gustavo Bueso Jacquier, and works of art by renowned Honduran artists. The five exhibition rooms are divided into: *Historical milestones of the University *Historical heritage of Comayag√ºela *The work of Arturo L√≥pez Rodezno *Collection of UNAH's Talking Arts *Collection of UNAH's Prehispanic Art The CAC also has two rooms and a lobby to make variable exhibitions of distinct thematic.

The highest National Prize for Honduran artists carries his name as a tribute. Biography =Parents and first years= Pablo Zelaya Sierra was born on October 30, 1896 in the municipality of Ojojona, Francisco Moraz√°n Department. His parents were Felipe Zelaya and Isabel Sierra. From early childhood, he developed his artistic interests and made his way to study at the School of Fine Arts in the neighboring Republic of Costa Rica in 1918‚Äì1919. =Decade in Spain= In 1920, Zelaya Sierra traveled to Madrid to study art at the Royal Academy of Fine arts of Saint Fernando, thanks to a scholarship from the Spanish Cooperation Agency in Honduras, thus becoming a disciple of and Daniel V√°zquez D√≠az, one of the major Spanish painters who also lived in Paris beside Pablo Picasso, Juan Gris and Joan Mir√≥. During his time in Europe, Zelaya Sierra participated in the following events and exhibitions: * National exhibition (Paris, 1922) * Salon d'Automne and National Exhibition (Paris, 1924) * Exhibition of the Society of Iberian Artists (Paris, 1925) * Individual exhibitions Salon des Independents (Paris, 1924) * Salon of the Heraldo de Madrid (1930) * Ateneo de Madrid (1932) Zelaya Sierra is also the author of an art manifesto: Aiming with a Pencil (1932), a significant document in understanding the art of his times. The strong and productive ideas of Zelaya Sierra enabled the birth of the modern art in Honduras.Mari√±as Otero, Luis. Acercamiento a la Cultura de Honduras. Tegucigalpa. Centro Cultural de Espa√±a en Tegucigalpa /AECID. Litograf√≠a Iberoamericana. 2009 =Death= In 1932, back in his native Honduras, his health began to deteriorate. He was rushed to the Saint Felipe Hospital, where he died at the age of 36 due to a massive stroke. Work In Zelaya Sierra's proposal, there is a multiplicity of formal appropriations that range from the use of Renaissance Chiaroscuro to the concepts of the Spanish painting movement of the period, and then progress into cubism. This was achieved later through his teachers Benedito and V√°squez D√≠az. Zelaya Sierra assumed aesthetic conditions like gravitational core, finding no problems on focusing closely on the Honduran social reality of the times. In fact, his iconography in 1932 features paintings illustrating the social and political conflicts of the times, such as \\"Brothers against Brothers\\", a magnificent painting in which he gathered the deep pain and the fear prevalent during one of the many guerras intestinas (civil wars) that shook the Honduran country in that decade. The painting marks his way of denouncing the harm and pain that a man inflicts upon his fellow men during a civil war. It is a moving, terrible and violent painting.

Built in 1837 and enlarged in 1860, it is a rare surviving example of a rural tavern in the state, with an added complex of agriculture-related outbuildings following its transition to a new role. The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. It now houses residences. Description and history The Locust Creek House Complex stands on the east side of Vermont Route 12, just south of its junction with Vermont Route 107. It is a rambling complex of wood-frame structures, one or two stories in height, with most of them connected together. Stretching along the road are a five-bay I-house and a four-bay carriage barn with open ground-floor bays. Projecting from the rear of the I-house is a 1-1/2 story ell, while a barn is joined to the northeast corner of the carriage barn, and a gabled shed extends further north from the side of the barn. with The southern sections of this structure have been covered in a modern metal roof, and adapted for residential use, with the open carriage barn bays used as vehicle parking. The house is the oldest portion of the building, and was constructed as a tavern in 1837. It was apparently not very successful financially, going through a number of lessee and ownership changes in its early years. The carriage barn was added in 1860, also including a large ballroom with a sprung floor on the second floor. Then billed as a hotel, it became a favored local social venue for dances and other events. Because the railroad did not pass nearby, it eventually declined and closed permanently in 1899. For the first half of the 20th century it was the centerpiece of a small dairy farm.

The conflict raged from 1974 to 1976 and resulted in approximately 233 deaths.Dickie, Mafia Republic: Italy's Criminal Curse, p. 138 The war broke the equilibrium in the triumvirate, made up of Antonio Macr√¨, Domenico Tripodo and Girolamo Piromalli, that had ruled the 'Ndrangheta for 15 years, and facilitated the rise of a new generation 'Ndranghetisti, in particular the De Stefano 'ndrina, who wanted to involve the 'Ndrangheta in new, more lucrative criminal activities (especially drug trafficking). Background Traditional 'Ndrangheta bosses like Domenico Tripodo and Antonio Macr√¨ were opposed to new developments in the organisation, such as the entry into kidnapping and drug trafficking. Gratteri & Nicaso, Fratelli di Sangue, p.58 They also opposed the formation of the Santa, a secret society within the 'Ndrangheta, established in the early 1970s to maximize the power and invisibility of the most important bosses. L‚Äôatteggiarsi delle associazioni mafiose sulla base delle esperienze processuali acquisite: la ‚Äôndrangheta , by Salvatore Boemi, in I delitti di criminalit√† organizzata, Quaderni del Consiglio Superiore della Magistratura N. 99 La criminalit√† organizzata dalle origini ai giorni nostri, Polizia Moderna, May 2008 By contrast, Girolamo Piromalli, their fellow boss in the triumvirate that had ruled the 'Ndrangheta for 15 years, favoured La Santa and was eager to modify the traditional rules of the 'Ndrangheta through the formation of covert Masonic lodges in which the 'Ndrangheta bosses were able to contact law enforcement authorities, judges and politicians that were necessary to access public work contracts in the state development of the Reggio Calabria area (a railroad stump, a steelwork center, and the port in Gioia Tauro).Paoli, Mafia Brotherhoods, p. 115 Guarino, Poteri segreti e criminalit√†, pp. 14-15, Nisio Palmieri, Dossier della Fondazione Cesar e dell‚ÄôAssociazione Sicurstrada per conto della Consulta Nazionale dei Consigli Regionali Unipol Assicurazioni At a meeting in September 1974, in Gioia Tauro, hosted by Piromalli to discuss an offer of a 3 percent kick back by the major construction companies for the Goia Tauro steelworks (which the 'Ndrangheta bosses rejected), tensions reached a boiling point. Tripodi and his former underling Giorgio De Stefano exchanged insults that almost escalated in a violent confrontation, only prevented by peacemaker Macr√¨.Dickie, Mafia Republic: Italy's Criminal Curse, pp. 137-40 Matters deteriorated when Tripodi, fearing an ambush, failed to show up at a wedding of a close ally of Piromalli. The conflict Tripodo tried to strike first, killing Giovanni De Stefano and wounding his brother Giorgio De Stefano on 24 November 1974, in the Roof Garden bar, an infamous 'Ndrangheta haunt in Reggio Calabria. Gratteri & Nicaso, Fratelli di Sangue, pp. 60-62 The conflict was now inevitable. In retaliation, on 20 January 1975, Macr√¨ was killed in his hometown Siderno while his right hand man Francesco Commisso was severely wounded. According to a state witness, a young Pasquale Condello, an ally of the De Stefanos, was one of his 'executioners'.Godfather's arrest fuels fear of bloody conflict, The Observer, February 24, 2008 Macr√¨ was killed with the help of the Cataldo and Mazzaferro clans. Tripodo was arrested on 21 February 1975, and incarcerated in the Poggioreale prison in Naples. On 26 August 26, 1976, he was stabbed to death in prison on the request of the De Stefanos with the help of Camorra boss Raffaele Cutolo, the boss of the Nuova Camorra Organizzata (NCO) who worked with the De Stefanos in drug trafficking. With the killing of Tripodo, the conflict withered to its end. However, the final stage was the killing of Giorgio De Stefano on 7 November 1977 in Santo Stefano in the Aspromonte. He was killed by Giuseppe Suraci, a minor 'Ndrangehta soldier, apparently out of personal vengeance, but in reality on the orders of Piromalli, who feared the rise of the De Stefanos. By extorting a bribe of a building contractor already under the protection of the Piromallis, De Stefano had committed a sgarro (insulting the honour and authority of a crime boss). The Piromallis had Suraci killed and offered his head on a silver platter to Giorgio's brother Paolo De Stefano, to show their allegiance, but in reality to prevent Suraci from revealing the real reason of the killing. =Casualties= The casualties of the war rose to 233 in three years. Apart from the main war, local feuds erupted in various towns such as Cittanova, Seminara, Cimin√† and Taurianova. Victims were sometimes fed to the pigs to make the bodies disappear.Dickie, Mafia Republic: Italy's Criminal Curse, p. 140 Aftermath The De Stefano clan moved from being simple 'Ndranghetisti to being the new ‚Äúlords‚Äù of Reggio Calabria.Paoli, Mafia Brotherhoods, pp. 50-51 They won a monopoly of construction work in northern Reggio Calabria, moving the rival Tripodo group out of the market of public work contracts with the support of the Piromalli and Mammoliti cosche.Arlacchi, Mafia Business, p. 156 Their dominant position would be challenged in the Second 'Ndrangheta war (1985-1991). The real victor, however, was the Piromalli 'ndrina who redirected the 'Ndrangheta clan from its rural base to an entrepreneurial criminal organisation assuming dominance over several public works in the Gioia Tauro area, particularly in the construction and operation of the new container seaport.

Contents  Francis devotes a chapter to praise of the vocation to the contemplative life. He reflects on 12 aspects of the contemplative life which may help contemplative women achieve the goals of their vocation, namely: \\"formation, prayer, the word of God, the sacraments of the Eucharist and Reconciliation, fraternal life in community, federations, the cloister, work, silence, the communications media and asceticism.\\" He notes in conclusion that nuns are needed by the \\"world and the Church\\" as \\"beacons of light for the journey of the men and women of our time\\". The constitution establishes new rules governing women's contemplative life, emphasizing the importance of the God-centered nature of monastic life. It also establishes new provisions for federation of contemplative communities. Those portions of canon law which are in conflict with Vultum Dei quaerare were partially repealed by the constitution; in particular, Francis cited portions of Pope Pius XII's apostolic constitution Sponsa Christi as well as portions of the instructions Inter Praeclara, published in 1950, and Verbi Sponsa, published in 1999. Particular attention was given to ongoing, recommending that monasteries cooperate and share resources, and to this end encouraged federation with other communities.\\"Vatican issues new norms for contemplative nuns\\", Catholic Ireland, July 24, 2016  Publication  During the Vatican press briefing during which Vultum Dei quaerere was presented to the public, Archbishop Jos√© Rodr√≠guez Carballo, O.F.M., secretary of the Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life, remarked that > in outlining the essential elements [of the contemplative life] there is no > lack of explicit references to contemplative women, to whom there is > presented the icon of Mary as summa contemplatrix [i.e. the greatest > contemplator], \\"Mary, Virgin, Bride and Mother, who welcomes and treasures > the Word in order to give it back to the world ... to help to bring Christ > to birth and increase in the hearts of men and women\\".

The area is part of the larger East European Plain. The terrain is flat, with altitude averaging 160 meters above sea level, and the rivers meander on broad floodplains. Agricultural use of the plain is high, mostly for grain growing ‚Äì wheat, barley and rye. The plain provides a flat south‚Äìnorth route for transportation, situated between uplands. Until a line of forts was built across the territory by the Russian government in the 1640s (the Belgorod Line), the plain was a route for Tatar invasion from the south. Topography The plain is about 250 km west‚Äìeast, and 500 km north‚Äìsouth. The central and southern parts are sometimes called the \\"Tambov plain\\", and are mostly contained in Tambov Oblast. The lowlands also includes portions of Lipetsk Oblast on the west, Ryazan Oblast to the north, Penza Oblast to the east, and Voronezh Oblast to the south. The soil includes widespread chernozym (\\"black earth\\"), with more podzolic (\\"under- ash\\") soils towards the north and some sandy regions in the south. Hydrography Because it is flat, the major rivers meander on broad floodplains. The main river in the north is the Tsna, which runs north through the city of Tambov and into the Moksha River, a right tributary of the Oka in the Volga basin. In the south, the plain narrows along the Khopyor River, flowing south into the Don River, and the Medevista, which is also in the Don Basin. The floodplains can be up to 20 km in width, with up to three terraces. Vegetation In modern times, the plain is heavily developed for agriculture. The primary grains are wheat, barley and rye, with 'industrial' crops such as sunflower seeds, sugar beets, and potatoes. Before modern development, the plain was forb meadow-steppe, with forest groves of pine, oak, and black alder along the river banks. The Oka‚ÄìDon lowlands include two federal-level nature reserves: the Voronina Nature Reserve in the southeast, and the Voronina Nature Reserve, both featuring forest-steppe habitat along rivers.

He was best known as a leading exponent of the philosophy of W. V. Quine.  Biography  Gibson was born in St. Louis, Missouri, to Roger Fletcher Gibson Sr. and Virginia Irene Melton. He spent his formative years moving throughout the country, eventually coming to live with his maternal grandparents about whom he would later remark were the most influential people in his life. Gibson joined the United States Marine Corps out of high school and volunteered for duty in Vietnam. He served in Saigon from October 1965 to October 1966. He considered his military service one of his greatest achievements. Gibson embarked upon the pursuit of philosophy as an academic career in 1967 upon the completion of his military service. He was ready to resume his education that year, having served in the United States Marine Corps immediately after high school, between 1962 and 1966, attached for part of that time as aide to General Westmoreland during the height of the Vietnam War. He enrolled in Northeast Missouri State College, currently Truman State University, where he graduated in 1971 with a B.A. in philosophy. Encouraged by his undergraduate philosophy professors, Henry Smits and Kay Blair, both holding doctorates from the University of Missouri, he applied to their graduate program in philosophy and was admitted in the fall of 1971. He developed a budding affinity for analytic philosophy while at the University of Missouri, receiving an M.A. in 1973 and a Ph.D. in 1977. His experience there was shaped by Arthur Berndtson, Donald Oliver, and John Kultgen, among others, the latter also directing his dissertation. Gibson served the discipline both as a leader and as a scholar. His first notable leadership role was as President of the Central States Philosophical Association in 1983‚Äì1984. His scholarly initiatives attracted attention from the outset, earning him grants from the National Endowment for the Humanities in 1984‚Äì1985 and 1988. His academic career flourished at Washington University in St. Louis, where he began teaching in 1985. He served as the Chair of the Department of Philosophy there for a decade between 1989 and 1999. His many contributions to the department included spearheading the creation of the school's Philosophy-Neuroscience-Psychology (PNP) Program in 1993, playing a prominent role in securing grants for that purpose from the James S. McDonnell Foundation. Gibson's formal areas of expertise were epistemology and the philosophy of language, with further competence in the philosophy of science. While publishing extensively in these areas, his overall engagement with philosophy was broad and deep enough for publication in other specialties as well, including those as diverse as logic and ethics. Most of his works, even on the rare occasion he turned to ethics, tend to revolve around the philosophy of W. V. Quine. Those that do are all well-received (as are the few that do not), earning him a reputation as one of the world's leading exponents of Quine. That reputation is the culmination of an early and steadfast interest in Quine. His master's thesis (1973) and doctoral dissertation (1977) are both on Quine. His persistent appeals to the Harvard philosopher for permission to sit in on his classes at Harvard University, while himself still enrolled as a graduate student at the University of Missouri, are something of an academic legend, related by Quine himself both in his autobiography, The Time of My Life: An Autobiography (1985), and in his foreword to Gibson's first book, The Philosophy of W. V. Quine: An Expository Essay (1982). The permission granted paved the way for some of the most influential secondary literature on Quine, including two monographs, three edited volumes, and numerous articles. Gibson's two monographs ‚Äî The Philosophy of W. V. Quine: An Expository Essay (1982) and Enlightened Empiricism: An Examination of W. V. Quine's Theory of Knowledge (1988) ‚Äî are held in especially high regard. His personal output on Quine was complemented by his ability to bring out the same in others. Attesting to his dedication to the enrichment of Quine studies, he organized, together with Robert B. Barrett Jr., a conference (April 9‚Äì13, 1988) bringing together at Washington University in St. Louis the world's foremost authorities on the subject, including Quine himself, as well as Donald Davidson, Dagfinn F√∏llesdal, Susan Haack, Gilbert Harman, Jaakko Hintikka, Jerrold Katz, Barry Stroud, and Joseph S. Ullian. The proceedings were published in 1990 as Perspectives on Quine. A festschrift organized in his honor in 2008 brought together eminent analytic philosophers from around the world: Robert B. Barrett Jr.; Lars Bergstr√∂m; Richard Creath; David Henderson; Terence Horgan; Ernest Lepore; Pete Mandik; Alex Orenstein; Kenneth Shockley; J. Robert Thompson; Josefa Toribio; Joseph S. Ullian; Josh Weisberg; Chase B. Wrenn. Gibson died at the age of 71 in Reston, Virginia, after a long battle with Parkinson's and Parkinson's dementia.

He took three pills of ecstasy and then went to stand behind his mother, Mary-Jo while she worked at the family computer for five minutes. He then began to beat her to death with a hammer. Hearing Mary-Jo's screams, Blake emerged from the bedroom and rushed to the scene and saw Tyler. They stared at each other for several moments before he beat his father to death.

He hid their bodies in the master bedroom. =Party= Some time after the murders, Tyler made a Facebook post letting people know that he was having a party that night. He then stopped at an ATM and then picked up some friends. About 60 people gathered for the party, playing beer pong, smoking cigars and drinking. That night Tyler told his best friend, Michael Mandell, that he bludgeoned his parents with a hammer. He showed Michael the master bedroom and the blood that was in the room.

He was the president and chairman of Gate City FC (a soccer club) in 2013, when that club fielded a team in the National Premier Soccer League. Cox is also currently the majority partner in Caveman Capital Partners, a venture capital and holding company.  Early life  Justin Cox was born and raised in Greensboro, North Carolina to Larry Cox and Barbara \\"Babs\\" Cox. Cox lived with his mother, who worked for Leon's Style Salons as a hair stylist and father whom owned a plumbing company (Cox Plumbing, Inc.) In Greensboro, Cox began playing soccer at the age of 5 among other sports. As his talent for the sport grew, Cox began to attract much more outside attention in Greensboro's soccer circles, leading his families decisions to allow him to play 3 years up in age. This allowing him to play with better competition, coaches, and gain more exposure to game. In 1998, Cox was part of the U.S. under-17 player pool. In 1998, Cox signed a Generation Adidas player contract, as a goalkeeper for Major League Soccer's Tampa Bay Mutiny, his first professional contract before graduating from high school. Before Cox could play his first game he was being sidelined the remainder of the year with a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee, required surgery and was subsequently sidelined. Cox returned after recovering, but knee injuries continued to plague him, causing him to be cut from his contract. Working summer jobs and after school with his father learning the family trade and good work ethics, Cox found time to enjoy the life lessons of the Boy Scouts of America and in 1999 received his Eagle Scout Award, the highest honor in scouting.  Business ventures  In 2000 at the age of 19, Cox accepted a position as president for Cox Plumbing, Inc. which provided residential plumbing repair and installation services.

Gouvia is a village and resort situated around Gouvino Bay in Corfu, Greece. It is situated around 8km (5 miles) North of Corfu town. Gouvias position in a natural harbour made it an ideal location for a shipyard, this was exploited during the Venetian occupation, when they built their arsenal in the village. The remains of it today are notable in the area. The village has a Greek Orthodox church, names All Saints'. There are many bars, restaurants and taverns along the main street serving mostly tourists from Northern Europe. There are a number of large hotels and self-catering apartments in the village. Venetian shipyard Located near the mouth of the Adriatic Sea, Corfu was a very strategic location for Venice and the Venetians built extensive fortifications to defend the island against incursions. The island was also at the centre of their naval operations in the Levant. As part of their defence plans the Venetians stationed two squadrons in Corfu, one of twenty five galleys, the other of twelve heavy sailing ships. Two Venetian Vice Admirals oversaw the naval operations in Corfu, one for each squadron. In the aftermath of the second great siege of Corfu by the Ottomans in 1716, the Venetians, as part of their reinforcement of the fortifications of Corfu, built the arsenal to service their ships and also stationed their galleys at Govino Bay. The arsenal was also used as storage for the Venetian ships. The shipyard at Gouvia was part of a network of Venetian arsenals and naval stations in Greece, including shipyards in the Aegean Sea, Epirus, the Peloponnese, the Kingdom of Candia (modern Crete) and even Venice itself. Aside from Corfu, such locations in Greece included Methoni, Koroni, Chalkis, Preveza, Chania and Heraklion. The Gouvia arsenal is in a strategic location well-suited to ship repairs as it was near a forested area and high quality wood was plentiful and easily available for ship maintenance. The practice of the Venetian captains, who participated in the construction of the arsenal, to inscribe the buildings with their initials and coats of arms, had been documented in the late-18th-century writings of French consul to Corfu Saint- Sauveur. The arsenal at Gouvia was supposed to be used for ship repairs during the winter after each fleet had returned from their yearly campaign during peacetime. However, the Venetian Senate became alarmed at the prospect of an arsenal in proximity to Venice which could potentially compete with the central arsenal and in order to protect the operations of their local naval facilities, the Senate opted to limit the kind of repair activities undertaken at the Corfu shipyard. Consequently, the shipyard operations at Gouvia were restricted to basic maintenance such as cleaning and caulking; many captains, instead of repairing their damaged ships at the arsenal, chose to sink them. As time went on, the number of ships being serviced at the location declined, and any further use was officially discontinued with the Treaty of Campo Formio, which was signed on 18 October 1798, marking the end of the Venetian Republic and with it the end of the Venetian period of Corfu, which had lasted for over 400 years. The surviving arches of the structure have been described as \\"beautifully boned\\", \\"strong\\" and \\"impressive\\", \\"almost surreal\\", and \\"a striking collection of skeletal arches\\".

Gupta studied medicine at Lady Hardinge Medical College (Delhi University) where she later became a director. In 1998 the Government of India awarded Gupta the third highest civilian honour, the Padma Bhushan, for her contributions to medical science. She was unmarried and lived in New Delhi when she was found murdered on 13 May 2006 at her residence in Karol Bagh. After years of investigation, the case, which attracted media attention, remains unsolved.  Medical contributions  Gupta and colleagues published a study in an Indian medical journal about a rare case tuberculosis in the thyroid. The article discusses the presentation of the patient, various tests used in diagnosis, a historical discussion of the case, and treatment methods.  Padma Bhushan  The Padma awards are given out in India every year on Republic Day, usually in quantities less than 120. There are 3 classes of Padma awards, distinguishing the quality of service from distinguished to high order to exceptional. The Padma Bhushan is in the second category, recognizing public achievements of a high order in one's specified field. Awards are given in a variety of disciplines including art, civil service, sports, and literature. The public is able to make nominations and the Padma Awards Committee, Prime Minister, and President collaborate to make the final decision. The Awards Committee looks for life long achievement, public service, and excellence in their nominees. Hem Lata Gupta earned this prestigious award in 1998 in the medical category, receiving a certificate with the President's signature and a medallion.  Murder  Police found Gupta dead in her Prasad Nagar apartment with her hands tied by rope, her mouth, nose, and eyes covered with surgical tape, and her throat cut. Neighbors reported seeing Gupta enter her apartment around 10:30 on the morning of her murder and seeing 2 male visitors present around the same time. Police arrived on the scene about an hour later, when neighbors seeking medical advice found her room unresponsive after extensive waiting. Possible links to her murder revolve around her name oddly appearing in a newspaper marriage advertisement and her apartment in Vasant Kunj. Police found Gupta's apartment to be under ownership of individuals with forged documentation. This case doesn't appear to be associated with robbery, as her jewelry collection and most of her possessions remained untouched, and remains unsolved by police.  Investigation  Gupta was unmarried and lived alone in the flat following the death of her sister and father. Jewellery and cash worth Rs. 60,000 was found intact in her room which suggests that it was not a regular case of robbery. A cupboard and a few boxes were open but there was no ransacking and it seemed that the assailant was known to her said deputy commissioner of police (central) Neeraj Thakur. Police are also trying to figure out whether she was tricked by a relative after the death of her father and sister. Gupta did not make any will. Police now say the narco test and questioning of a TV mechanic, a servant of another doctor and a marriage bureau executive to determine her killer were ‚Äúhighly misleading‚Äù . ‚ÄúThe narco test indicated towards the role of the TV mechanic. Yet, independent witnesses said he had visited their houses in the trans-Yamuna region to repair TV sets during the time of the murder,‚Äù the source added. Investigators are having a relook into this unsolved case after some people entered Gupta‚Äôs Vasant Kunj flat on August 14 and claimed that Gupta had sold it to them. The flat had been locked since it was bought on January 28, 1991. After the RWA informed police, they came across two people both of whom claim to own the flat. One of them, Kaushalya Rani of Moti Nagar, said she had bought the property from Gupta and showed the power of attorney and a cash receipt. Another person, Ramnik Agarwal of Jalandhar, also claimed the same and said he had come with five others to get the flat cleaned and found Kaushalya. All documents were forged, police said, ‚ÄúWe are yet to arrest anyone. But we are questioning all of them as it seems they are planted by others. We are grateful to the local RWA for informing us,‚Äù said an officer.

Early life and career Alican was born in Adapazarƒ±, a city in northwestern Turkey, 150 km east of Istanbul. He left his hometown after middle school, attending high school and college in Istanbul, where he graduated from Robert College with a B.S. (1949) and from Istanbul University with an M.D. (1955). He did his residency at the Istanbul University Medical Center's Clinic of Treatment and Exploratory Surgery, also known as Surgical Clinic #4, headed by ≈ûinasi Hakkƒ± Erel. It is there that he met his future wife, Halide Ihlamur, later Halide Alican, a surgical nurse working at the same clinic. After completing his residency in general surgery at Istanbul University, his growing interest in the field of organ transplantation, then in its heyday, took him to Jackson, Mississippi, where he joined the University of Mississippi team leading the world in transplantation research, including the first lung transplant (11 June 1963) and the first heart transplant (23 January 1964), under the leadership of James D. Hardy. A few weeks after his arrival there in the summer of 1960, he proposed to Ihlamur, as he always called her, even after she took his name and dropped hers, and they got married in Jackson in November 1960, remaining married for fifty-five years (1960‚Äì2015) until his death at age eighty-six. He also obtained a master's degree (M.S., 1962) in physiology at the University of Mississippi, studying with Arthur C. Guyton, while working as a research fellow (soon to become a research associate) in Hardy's department of surgery. Best known for his work in organ transplantation, though with some notable initiatives in physiology as well, Alican later established a successful private practice as a general surgeon. His professional career was divided between medical research in the United States and private practice in Turkey.  Main Contributions  Alican's main contributions came in the 1960s (1960‚Äì1971) when he worked at the University of Mississippi Medical Center (UMMC) in the pioneering days of laboratory research and clinical studies in organ transplantation. His research focused largely on the lungs and on the liver, though he is also known for his work on intestinal transplantation. He performed the first ever simultaneous bilateral lung transplantation in canines, one of many such operations paving the way for the procedure in humans. His role in the development of surgical techniques in transplantation was complemented by his work in physiology, including transplantation biology in general as well as a particular specialty in the physiology of shock. Relocating to Istanbul in 1971, he held a professorship in surgery at Istanbul University until 1979, turning to private practice upon the institution of legal and regulatory changes barring academic physicians from working outside the university. At the time of his departure from the University of Mississippi, he was an attending surgeon at the university hospital as well as associate director of the transplantation program there. Twenty years later, he became a founding member (\\"fellow\\") of the James D. Hardy Society, established in 1991. He has published extensively both in English and in Turkish. His journal articles, mostly in English, are almost exclusively in the areas of organ transplantation and physiology. His monographs, all in Turkish, are more diverse, ranging from general surgery to organ transplantation to cancer research and the in-depth study of various other diseases. The division mirrors the transformation of his career from medical research in the United States to general surgery in Turkey. His autobiography (2000/2007) describes that transformation as coming with a natural obstacle to research: the relative scarcity of institutional resources in Turkey at that time. He notes that this not only held back progress in laboratory and clinical studies but also impeded scholarly initiatives inevitably undermined by the inadequacy of academic libraries. The solution he reports having implemented is the creation and maintenance of his own library, complete with a card catalog, populated with entries from leading medical journals acquired with his own funds. Specifically, he reports having maintained personal subscriptions to twenty-two medical journals for over thirty years. He identifies these periodical holdings, supplemented by the selective acquisition of books on an ongoing but less regular schedule, as the main flow of information for the wall-to-wall card catalog in his office where he would personally enter the bibliographic details of each article in every issue. Alican credits this makeshift system for enabling him to publish a combined total of 3,000 pages on top of his output in the United States.

They were used as main guns on light ships of the early 19th century, and on the quarterdeck and forecastle of ships of the line. They were similar in design to the Canon de 8 Gribeauval.  Usage  The 8-pounder was the heaviest of the light guns. As the short variant was relatively light, it could be mounted on the upper gun posts of ships of the line, where the timber of the deck was too light to support larger guns, and without jeopardising the stability of the ship. It was also used on frigates, xebecs and corvettes, as an addition to the larger guns of the main battery (usually 12- or 18-pounders, and sometimes 24-pounders). Mounted on the sides of the ships, the 8-pounders reinforced the weight of the broadside. A long version of the same gun, the 8-pounder long gun, could be mounted at the bow or stern, parallel to the axis of the ship, and used as a chase gun.

It was released on digital distribution service Steam for Windows, OS X, and Linux, and for the PlayStation Plus service in August 2016, before being released on PlayStation 4 a month later. It was released on Xbox One on September 18, 2017, and on the Nintendo Switch on October 11, 2018. The game runs on the Unity engine and was created by independent studio WeirdBeard. The game received favourable reviews.  Gameplay  Tricky Towers uses physics based tower building game mechanics. Although there is some visual similarity to Tetris, the gameplay is entirely different. It features falling blocks but the goal is to stack blocks onto a tower rather than clear rows. Random blocks drop from the top of the screen and rows do not disappear, but blocks may fall off the tower. During the game, events may cause changes to the block physics, such as doubling in size, becoming slippery, or dropping at faster rates. The player takes control of one of the available wizard avatars and must, depending on the game mode, compete against other wizards in building his wizard tower to be as tall and stable as possible, and as quickly as possible. The games are short and fast-paced and are easy to pick up and play. Pieces move in half-square increments. Players can use magic spells to assist themselves or to hinder opponents. During a match, there are 17 spells which can become available to the player. Spells are divided into Light and Dark magic categories - Light magic focuses on augmenting your tower while Dark Magic revolves around interfering with your opponents, such as damaging or weakening their towers, or meddling with their engineering efforts in other devious ways. The game has 3 distinct multiplayer game modes: Race, Survival and Puzzle. In the Race game mode, players must compete to be the first to build a tower tall enough to pass the finish line. Efficiency and construction speed are key to this game mode and it makes for a fast-paced and frantic game experience. In Survival, the player must try and place a certain number of bricks on their tower without dropping too many and losing their health. They must focus on careful construction and smart application of spells to triumph. The Puzzle game mode is more slow-paced compared to the other two. Players need to try and place as many bricks on their tower as possible below a certain cut-off point. This requires a more creative style of play, as the player has to try and overcome the physics and come up with various engineering solutions. There are also a number of single-player challenges available, where the player has to try and achieve a certain set of conditions depending on the challenge to succeed. There are also single-player versions of the Survival and Puzzle game modes where players compete for a high score, and the Xbox version of the game introduced a single-player version of the Race game mode, which was later added to other platforms.  Development  Development started on Tricky Towers after WeirdBeardGames‚Äô previous title 99 Bricks Wizard Academy was released in 2014. It is a continuation of a concept they've been developing and improving upon since 2009, starting with 99 Bricks Classic, which was released on the online game platform Kongregate. After release new languages and block skins were added to the game. A larger Indie Friends DLC adding a set of new wizard characters using characters from other Indie games was released on July 19, 2017. Reception Tricky Towers on PC and Nintendo Switch received \\"generally favorable\\" reviews from critics according to review aggregation website Metacritic, while the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions received \\"mixed or average\\" reviews. A PS Nation review thought the game was fun but not easy. The Nintendo Life review of the Switch version summarized with: \\"Although the single player offerings are a bit on the slim side, we enjoyed our time with Tricky Towers and would highly recommend it for anybody looking for a good couch multiplayer or puzzle game.\\" References External links 99 Bricks at Kongregate 2016 video games Video games developed in the Netherlands Linux games MacOS games PlayStation 4 games Windows games Xbox One games Puzzle video games Falling block puzzle games Nintendo Switch games Unity (game engine) games Multiplayer and single-player video games ","title":"Tricky Towers"},{"id":"51146968","text":"Paneer makhani (also called paneer butter masala) is a slightly sweet creamy dish of paneer, originating from the Indian subcontinent, in which the gravy is prepared usually with butter (makhan), tomatoes, cashews or cream.

A generative grammar provides a set of operations such as rewriting, insertion, deletion, movement, or combination, and is interpreted as a definition of the set of all and only the objects that these operations are capable of producing through iterative application. A model-theoretic grammar simply states a set of conditions that an object must meet, and can be regarded as defining the set of all and only the structures of a certain sort that satisfy all of the constraints. The approach applies the mathematical techniques of model theory to the task of syntactic description: a grammar is a theory in the logician's sense (a consistent set of statements) and the well-formed structures are the models that satisfy the theory.  Examples of model-theoretic grammars  The following is a sample of grammars falling under the model-theoretic umbrella: *the non-procedural variant of Transformational grammar (TG) of George Lakoff, that formulates constraints on potential tree sequences *Johnson and Postal's formalization of Relational grammar (RG) (1980), Generalized phrase structure grammar (GPSG) in the variants developed by Gazdar et al. (1988), Blackburn et al.

Professional career =St. Louis Cardinals= The St. Louis Cardinals selected Mayers in the third round of the 2013 Major League Baseball draft. He signed and made his professional debut with the GCL Cardinals before being promoted to the Peoria Chiefs, where he finished the season. In innings pitched between the two teams, he posted a 1‚Äì3 record and 2.97 ERA. He spent 2014 with the Palm Beach Cardinals, Springfield Cardinals, and Memphis Redbirds, compiling a combined 8‚Äì12 record, 3.39 ERA, and 1.37 WHIP in 26 starts between the two teams. In 2015, Mayers was 2‚Äì4 with an ERA of 5.87 for the GCL Cardinals and Springfield, and underwent surgery for thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS). Recovered from TOS, Mayers progressed through the two highest minor league levels in 2016. First, he pitched for Springfield, where he was a mid-season All-Star. Over nine starts for Springfield, Mayers was 5‚Äì2 with a 2.30 ERA. He was then promoted back to Memphis in May. The Cardinals selected Mayers' contract from Memphis on July 23, 2016, and announced that he would make his Major League Baseball (MLB) debut the following day against the Los Angeles Dodgers on national television on ESPN's Sunday Night Baseball. He had a 3‚Äì3 record and 2.94 ERA over nine starts for Memphis prior to his promotion. In his debut, each of the first four batters he faced in the first inning reached base, and all scored on a grand slam by the fourth, first baseman Adri√°n Gonz√°lez. In all, 10 of 14 batters reached base as Mayers surrendered nine earned runs, eight hits, and two walks, while recording four outs for an in-game ERA of 60.75. Per the Elias Sports Bureau, he became the first major leaguer to surrender at least nine runs while advancing through fewer than two innings in his debut. Said opposing starter Scott Kazmir of Mayers, \\"I felt for him, yeah. It's your debut, it's hot and it's on ESPN. It was a tough draw for him.\\" The Cardinals optioned him back to Memphis the day after his first major league start. He got his first win, in relief on September 6, in Pittsburgh, pitching a perfect eighth inning. During spring training 2018, Mayers pitched 12 scoreless innings, striking out 13, earning him a spot on the Opening Day roster. He was optioned to Memphis and recalled back to St. Louis six times before being recalled for a seventh, and final time, on June 8. He was placed on the disabled list for the first time in his major league career on August 26 with right shoulder inflammation, and activated on September 11. Mayers finished his 2018 campaign with a 2‚Äì1 record and a 4.70 ERA in fifty relief appearances. Mayers began the 2019 season with St. Louis, but was placed on the injured list on April 17. He was activated on July 23. On August 4, Mayers was designated for assignment, and on August 6, he was outrighted to Memphis. On September 1, he was added to the expanded roster for September callups. Over 19 relief innings pitched with St. Louis, Mayers went 0‚Äì1 with a 6.63 ERA, striking out 16 batters. =Los Angeles Angels= On November 1, 2019, Mayers was claimed off waivers by the Los Angeles Angels.

In August 1940, in London, he founded the FRANCE daily.  Early life  Born in 1880 in Montpellier, the son of a general of the Engineer Regiment, he went to the √âcole normale sup√©rieure in 1900. Then, he was nominated as an associate professor of German in the secondary school in Bourges. The following year, he went around the world for one year, thanks to a scholarship financed by the philanthropist Albert Kahn. He resided, in particular, in the United States, Japan and China. During his travels, he found a passion for political problems and international relationships. On 18 April 1906, he was an accidental witness of the San Francisco earthquake; he related it in the French daily newspaper Le Temps without realising he was starting his journalist career. Journalist After returning from his travels, he moved to Germany as a lecturer in the G√∂ttingen University. Then, he was employed by Le Temps as a correspondent in Vienna, at the time capital of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and was deemed in 1911 a particular correspondent of that newspaper in Berlin. His telegrams described and analyzed the progress of the militaristic ambitions of the German government and the feverish but also worried ambiance that slowly gained Berlin.

It is situated on the west slope of 4,300 feet Mount Mansfield, in the 39,837-acre Mount Mansfield State Forest. Activities includes hiking, camping, mountain biking, stream fishing, wildlife watching, and picnicking. Facilities include group and individual camping areas, a picnic shelter, and hiking trails. The park is formally open between Memorial Day weekend and Columbus Day weekend, but is accessible for periods outside those times; fees are charged. Much of the park's infrastructure was built by the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) in the 1930s; these facilities were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002. Features Underhill State Park is located in eastern Underhill, about east of the town center. It occupies a portion of the western flank of Mount Mansfield, including a significant portion of the highest summit ridge (roughly between \\"The Nose\\" and \\"The Chin\\"). The developed facilities of the park are divided into a lower and upper area. The lower area is centered around the ranger station, and includes a parking area, picnic area, and a small number of walk-in tent and leanto camping sites. From this point a CCC-built road winds up the hill to the upper area, which is a small group camping area with seven leantos and two tent sites. with Both areas are equipped with restrooms that provide flush toilets and cold running water. The picnic area includes a CCC-built shelter and fireplaces. There are four hiking trails to the summit ridge of Mount Mansfield. The Sunset Ridge Trail is to the summit, and is the most direct route. The Long Trail traverses the summit ridge. The park facilities are open between the weekends of Memorial and Columbus Day. The main gate is left open thereafter until the first snow, and is reopened after enough snow has fallen to make cross-country skiing possible. History The west side of Mount Mansfield has been a tourist destination since the mid-19th century. In 1858 a small hotel called The Halfway House was built in what is now the park, providing lodging and stabling for tourists seeking to ascend the mountain. The hotel was demolished in 1939, and only its foundation remains. The park was established by the state in 1933, and much of its infrastructure was developed between then and 1940 by the CCC, which had a work crew based here. The CCC improved the road to the park, constructed the road to the upper area, and built some of the leantos in the upper campground, the picnic lodge, the comfort facilities, and the ranger station and quarters. Its crews also planted groves of Norway spruce. The well-preserved nature of these facilities prompted their listing on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002.

It was built in the neoclassical style between 1965 and 1971 on the site of Auberge d'Auvergne, which had been destroyed by aerial bombardment during World War II. History The Courts of Justice building stands on the site of Auberge d'Auvergne, a 16th-century building which housed knights of the Order of Saint John from the langue of Auvergne. The auberge was converted into a courthouse in the 19th century, and it remained so until the building was severely damaged when it was hit by a German parachute mine on 30 April 1941, during World War II. The law courts moved to another location outside Valletta, but in 1943 they returned to the part of the auberge which was still standing. They remained there until 1956, when the premises had to be vacated due to their dilapidated state. The ruins of the auberge were subsequently demolished, and construction of a new courthouse on the same site began on 5 May 1965. The present courthouse was inaugurated on 9 January 1971 by Prime Minister George Borg Olivier, Governor-General Maurice Henry Dorman, Archbishop Mikiel Gonzi, and a number of judges, magistrates, ministers and other guests. The first case in the new building was held two days later on 11 January 1971. The courthouse also houses the Civil Courts Registry, the Court Archives, the police lock-up and a car park. The Valletta Police Station was formerly also housed within the building. The courthouse has been criticized, in the past, for its lack of security and for having the elevators out of order. Some buildings, opposite the Law Courts building on Strait Street, are an extension of the courts. Architecture The Courts of Justice building is built to the designs of architect Jo Tonna in the neoclassical style, and its main feature is a portico with six columns. The building has seven floors, three of which are below the main front street level. The building occupies an entire block of the city, except one corner which is occupied by the Savoy Building.

Biography  An unscrupulous schemer, La Morli√®re first sought the support of the party of Voltaire, applauding the verse of the master, and when he found himself sufficiently established at caf√© Procope, became an entrepreneur of success and dramatic falls. Surrounded by a paid gang, he moved to the parterre, giving the signal for applause for authors who had offered him some dinners or a few louis, and the signal for whistles against those from whom he had received nothing. In order to replace the whistle that the police did not always tolerate, he had imagined a sort of protracted yawn that produced a disastrous effect. Believing himself master of the theater, La Morli√®re had the idea to use his means of action for his own account and wrote comedies but, despite all the efforts of his cabal, they fell, and with them his influence. Fr√©ron, who he had attacked, gave him the final blow. Accused of baseness and cowardice and also of relations with the police, he was abandoned by everyone and ended his life in deep poverty. He was among the regulars of Marie Anne Doublet's salon.

The language was originally called DBL; later it was referred to as Synergy Language; as of 2012 the official name is Synergy DBL. It is based on Digital Equipment Corporation‚Äôs DIBOL programming language. DBL has an English-like syntax that was designed to be self- documenting and highly readable, but not verbose. The language is procedural and, since 2007 (version 9.1), object-oriented. Support for Microsoft‚Äôs .NET Framework was added in 2010 (version 9.5). Code is split into two divisions (data and procedure) and uses a rigid hierarchy. The language includes a standard library consisting of 240 built-in subroutines and functions, 10 built-in classes, and 11 APIs that provide functionality such as access to XML from within DBL programs and sending and receiving data via HTTP/HTTPS. Synergy DBL is cross-platform, with the current version running on all modern Windows platforms (Windows 7/Server 2008 R2 and higher), as well as on HP-UX, IBM AIX, Oracle Solaris, several varieties of Linux, HP OpenVMS Alpha, HP OpenVMS I64 Integrity, and VSI OpenVMS for Integrity servers. Applications can be developed on one platform and ported to other platforms. Traditional DBL is implemented as bytecode, which is executed by the Synergy Runtime. Synergy .NET programs are CLS-compliant and run under the .NET Framework. DBL is distributed as part of a suite of programming tools sold as Synergy/DE Professional Series by Synergex International Corporation.  History  Synergy DBL is based on Digital Equipment Corporation‚Äôs DIBOL. DBL was developed by Digital Information Systems Corporation (DISC; the company name was changed to Synergex in 1996) in the late 1970s as a DIBOL alternative, targeting system integrators who combined DEC hardware with third-party peripherals. DIBOL ran only on DEC hardware, while DBL ran on most major business computer platforms. By mid-1979, DBL was being sold as a DIBOL- compatible compiler for PDP-11 (and compatibles) running RT-11 and RSTS/E. November 1980: DBL 2.0 released for DEC‚Äôs PDP-11- based systems. It compiled and executed programs written in DBL 1.3 or Dibol-11, and ran on RT-11, TSX, RSTS, and RSX-11M. This was the first structured version of DBL. New features included an INCLUDE facility, global storage definition, and fixed-length binary I/O. January 1983: VMS native-mode version of DBL released to run on VAX. At this time, DBL was also available for DEC RT-11, TSX/TSX-Plus, RSTS, and RSX-11M/M-Plus. Summer 1984: Initial version 4 released for MS-DOS. (Other platforms were released in 1985, including VMS and TSX-Plus.) The language was rewritten in C and included support for virtual memory, multi-dimensional arrays, and the ability to bind two or more programs together into one executable. December 1984: DBL version 4 released for the AT&T Unix operating system. It included the ability to chain to non-DBL programs and interface to subroutines written in other languages. December 1987: First DBL utility announced, a windowing tool designed to simplify the display of menus and help screens. It enabled developers to open up to 256 windows. February 1993: DBL replaced DIBOL on Digital Equipment Corporation‚Äôs VAX, Alpha AXP, DEC OSF/1, and Intel-based SCO Unix systems. April 1995: Version 5.7.3 expanded the supported platforms to include Linux and Microsoft Windows (Windows 3.1, 95, and NT). April 2007: Version 9.1 added support for object-oriented programming, and the compiler was rewritten to support objects and provide better error detection. November 2010: Version 9.5 added support for Microsoft‚Äôs .NET Framework, giving programmers access to .NET Framework classes in addition to DBL classes. The language was integrated with Microsoft‚Äôs Visual Studio. December 2014: Version 10.3 added support for creating programs that can run on Android and iOS devices.

More precisely, in any such Lie group there is a uniform neighbourhood of the identity element such that every lattice in the group has a conjugate whose intersection with this neighbourhood contains only the identity. This result was proven in the sixties by David Kazhdan and Grigori Margulis.  Statement and remarks  The formal statement of the Kazhdan‚ÄìMargulis theorem is as follows. :Let G be a semisimple Lie group: there exists an open neighbourhood U of the identity e in G such that for any discrete subgroup Gamma subset G there is an element g in G satisfying gGamma g^{-1} cap U = { e }. Note that in general Lie groups this statement is far from being true; in particular, in a nilpotent Lie group, for any neighbourhood of the identity there exists a lattice in the group which is generated by its intersection with the neighbourhood: for example, in mathbb R^n, the lattice varepsilon mathbb Z^n satisfies this property for varepsilon > 0 small enough. = Proof = The main technical result of Kazhdan‚ÄìMargulis, which is interesting in its own right and from which the better-known statement above follows immediately, is the following. :Given a semisimple Lie group without compact factors G endowed with a norm cdot, there exists c > 1, a neighbourhood U_0 of e in G, a compact subset E subset G such that, for any discrete subgroup Gamma subset G there exists a g in E such that ggamma g^{-1} ge cgamma for all gamma in Gamma cap U_0. The neighbourhood U_0 is obtained as a Zassenhaus neighbourhood of the identity in G: the theorem then follows by standard Lie-theoretic arguments. There also exist other proofs, more geometric in nature and which can give more information.  Applications  = Selberg's hypothesis = One of the motivations of Kazhdan‚ÄìMargulis was to prove the following statement, known at the time as Selberg's hypothesis (recall that a lattice is called uniform if its quotient space is compact): :A lattice in a semisimple Lie group is non- uniform if and only if it contains a unipotent element. This result follows from the more technical version of the Kazhdan‚ÄìMargulis theorem and the fact that only unipotent elements can be conjugated arbitrarily close (for a given element) to the identity. = Volumes of locally symmetric spaces = A corollary of the theorem is that the locally symmetric spaces and orbifolds associated to lattices in a semisimple Lie group cannot have arbitrarily small volume (given a normalisation for the Haar measure). For hyperbolic surfaces this is due to Siegel, and there is an explicit lower bound of pi / 21 for the smallest covolume of a quotient of the hyperbolic plane by a lattice in mathrm{PSL}_2(mathbb R) (see Hurwitz's automorphisms theorem). For hyperbolic three-manifolds the lattice of minimal volume is known and its covolume is about 0.0390. In higher dimensions the problem of finding the lattice of minimal volume is still open, though it has been solved when restricting to the subclass of arithmetic groups. = Wang's finiteness theorem = Together with local rigidity and finite generation of lattices the Kazhdan-Marguilis theorem is an important ingredient in the proof of Wang's finiteness theorem. :If G is a simple Lie group not locally isomorphic to mathrm{SL}_2(mathbb R) or mathrm{SL}_2(mathbb C) with a fixed Haar measure and v>0 there are only finitely many lattices in G of covolume less than v.

Led since its founding in 1992 by Rabbi Moshe Weinberger, the synagogue was named after the Piaseczna Rav, Rabbi Kalonymus Kalman Shapira, known by the name of his last work, Aish Kodesh, who was a leading Polish Hasidic rabbi in prewar Europe. By injecting Hasidic elements into the prayer services, social events, and daily classes, Aish Kodesh has been called a \\"phenomenon\\" and a \\"revolution\\" in the religious community of Long Island.Besser, Yisroel. \\"Breslov Revisited\\". Mishpacha, May 12, 2010, pp. 30-40. History The Piaseczna Rav, Rabbi Kalonymus Kalman Shapira, known as the Aish Kodesh Rabbi Moshe Weinberger Aish Kodesh was founded in December 1992 by a group led by Rabbi Moshe Weinberger, a native of Queens, New York, who received rabbinic ordination from Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary (RIETS). Raised in a Modern Orthodox home, Weinberger earned master's degrees in Jewish philosophy from the Bernard Revel Graduate School of Jewish Studies at Yeshiva University, and in educational administration from Columbia University Teachers College, and taught in Jewish day schools for two decades before becoming the rabbi of Aish Kodesh. Weinberger named the synagogue after the Piaseczna Rav, Rabbi Kalonymus Kalman Shapira, known by the name of his last work, Aish Kodesh (Holy Fire), who was a leading Polish Hasidic rabbi in prewar Europe. He explained his choice in a 1999 article in Jewish Action: > The Rebbe was truly a holy fire sent to warm the hearts and illuminate the > minds of a broken generation. In the depth of the darkness, he remained > steadfast in his unshakable faith in the immortality of Knesses Yisrael [the > Congregation of Israel]. Our generation has been resurrected from the ashes > of Auschwitz and Treblinka, yet we have fallen into a state of spiritual > numbness, a life of cold prayers, empty mitzvos, rote learning, and an > overall sense of spiritual alienation . . . Thus our experiment began with > the Aish Kodesh as our role model for spiritual renewal and the Shulchan > Aruch as our guide to uncompromising halachic observance. Weinberger introduced Hasidic practices and teachings into the congregation to forge connection and meaning in Jewish observance. These practices include leading the congregation in song and dance after prayer services, as well as accompanying congregants on tours of kivrei tzaddikim (graves of the righteous) in the Ukraine and Israel. Weinberger teaches the works of the Piaseczna Rav in weekly lectures at the synagogue and since 2000 has conducted an annual hillula celebration on the yahrtzeit of the Piaseczna Rav as well as on Lag BaOmer, the hillula of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai, which each attract more than 1,000 attendees. In 2015 a collection of Weinberger's Torah discourses delivered at the annual hillula for the Piaseczna Rav was published under the title Warmed by the Fire of the Aish Kodesh. Weinberger's lectures and the daily schedule of classes for men and women draw on a wide variety of Hasidic sources, including the Baal Shem Tov, Ramchal, Rebbe Nachman of Breslov, the Baal HaTanya, and Izbica, as well as the Vilna Gaon, Rabbi Tzadok Hakohen, and Rabbi Avraham Yitzchak Kook among many others. Modern-day Hasidic works by Rabbi Sholom Noach Berezovsky, the previous Slonimer Rebbe of Jerusalem, The Lubavitcher Rebbe, and Rabbi Yaakov Meir Shechter of Breslov are also studied. Building design The synagogue building is modeled after a Polish Hasidic shtiebel. The front doors are replicas of the doors fronting the Rema synagogue in Krak√≥w. A huge mural depicting the Warsaw Ghetto appears inside the entrance. Israeli artist Ofra Friedland was commissioned to produce \\"murals, ceramics, paintings, bronze sculpture, stained glass windows, woodwork and stone artwork\\" throughout the synagogue. In the main sanctuary, the high mechitza separating the men's and women's sections contains one-way glass so that women can observe the proceedings. In 2015 the synagogue received $75,000 in federal funding from the United States Department of Homeland Security toward the installation of security enhancements such as \\"forced-entry-resistant technology, security-modified doors, alarm systems and surveillance cameras\\".

In the United States, at least three political cultures took root during the colonial period. They were formed in New England by religious refugees from England, in the Mid-Atlantic region by Dutch settlers, in Virginia by English adventurers seeking fortune in the New World, and in Carolina by English investors who envisioned a model constitutional society. In Virginia and Carolina, and later elsewhere in the South, Scots-Irish settlers influenced the cultural hearth that created the American South. Each began with established cultures of the British Isles and the Netherlands, evolving into unique cultures that remain in existence today in the United States. Research on the political culture of the US The political scientist Daniel J. Elazar identified three primary political cultures, generally consistent with those of Tocqueville. Moralistic political culture evolved out of New England and is characterized by an emphasis of community and civic virtue over individualism. Individualistic political culture arose from Dutch influence in the Mid-Atlantic region; it regards multiculturalism as a practicality and government as a utilitarian necessity. Traditionalistic political culture arose in the South, which elevates social order and family structure to a prominent role. It accepts a natural hierarchy in society and where necessary to protect society, authoritarian leadership in the political and religious realms. Elazar, American Federalism, pp. 93‚Äì102. The formation of traditionalistic political culture is often thought to have arisen principally out of Virginia, the first and most populous southern colony. Virginia was also the most politically powerful state after the Revolution: pursuant to the first census of the United States in 1790 it held a greater percentage of congressional representatives than any other state has ever enjoyed up to the present day. Nevertheless, others argue that South Carolina had the greater influence as a result of its Grand Model enabling slaveholders from Barbados to establish a durable aristocracy. That unique convergence produced a slave society with a majority black population rigidly controlled by the plantation elite. Maintaining such a society required intense political resolve and the development of a mythology of white racial supremacy. The South Carolina hybrid model ultimately spread across the Deep South and was unwavering in its promotion of southern culture, whereas Virginia and other Upper South states were less comfortable with the region‚Äôs ‚Äúpeculiar institution‚Äù of slavery.Wilson, The Ashley Cooper Plan, pp. 142‚Äì81. The political scientist Richard Ellis identified egalitarianism, individualism, and hierarchy as defining cultures in American political culture. These principal categories correspond closely with Elazar‚Äôs classification. According to Ellis, each of these cultures lays claim to the ideals of equality and liberty articulated by John Locke, but what they are claiming is an only a piece of Locke, and one that is not necessarily consistent with the whole.Ellis, American Political Cultures, pp. 1‚Äì3, 28‚Äì29, 42‚Äì44. Popular authors have found similar divisions within American political culture. Colin Woodard identified eleven ‚Äúrival regional cultures,‚Äù while Joel Garreau identified nine.Woodard, American nationsGarreau, Nine Nations. The social psychologist Peter J. Rentfrow led a research effort that generally supports Elazar's theory of political culture, while finding that psychological variables allow for a more fine-grained geographical analysis. His research on ‚Äúpsychological topography‚Äù was based on multiple samples of more than a million respondents. The researchers found ‚Äúoverwhelming evidence for regional variation across the United States on a range of key political, economic, social, and health indicators.‚ÄùRentfrow, et al., ‚ÄúDivided We Stand,‚Äù pp. 996‚Äì1009. Appalachian and frontier political culture Many settlers who populated the South took to the backcountry, eventually crossing the Appalachians. Of these, the Scots-Irish originating from northern Ireland and the border region between England and Scotland were among the largest and most influential. While they might be considered a distinct political culture in colonial times, they eventually developed a symbiotic relationship with the southern plantation elite. As W. J. Cash wrote in The Mind of the South, ‚Äúthe tradition of aristocracy met and married with the tradition of the backwoods.‚ÄùCash, The Mind of the South, p. 72. The Frontier Thesis advanced by the historian Frederick Jackson Turner in 1893 argued that American culture, including political culture, was forged as Americans moved west. It was violent and individualistic and yet contained a primitive form of egalitarianism. In Elazar‚Äôs view, however, it was the South that acquired these traits most and carried them west to Missouri, Texas, and eventually as far as Southern California.Dochuk, From Bible Belt to Sun Belt, pp. xv‚Äìxvi Lockean liberalism and political culture In another unifying thesis about political culture that, like the Frontier Thesis, some have argued that Lockean liberalism is a central underlying explanation of American political culture. Notably, the political scientist Louis Hartz argued that the nation‚Äôs founding principles, which were largely drawn from Locke, created a new political culture that was unique to the United States. The nation ‚Äúbegins with Locke,‚Äù he wrote, and it ‚Äústays with Locke.‚Äù He found that Alexis de Tocqueville was first to recognize this when he saw that the nation was the first to create its own democratic future without having to endure revolution.Hartz, The Liberal Tradition in America, pp. 6, 35. Urban-rural divide Political culture can be seen as bifurcated by urban and rural geography. The United States was largely a rural nation until 1920. When the census that year revealed that urban Congressional Districts would exceed those of rural areas, rural congressmen refused to approve reapportionment, the only time that has happened.Martis and Elmes, Historical Atlas of State Power. A cultural divide remains to the present with rural areas often associating with traditionalistic political culture, while urban areas are more often aligned with moralistic and individualistic political culture. Re-aggregation of political cultures in metropolitan areas Researchers Dante Chinni and James Gimpel identified twelve cultural communities found throughout the United States, with varying degrees of geographic concentration. The categories are derived from analysis of statistical data, and they offer a more realistic portrayal of the geographically discontinuous cultural fabric of the nation than blanket state and regional categories.Chinni and Gimpel, Our Patchwork Nation. In physical space, as in cyberspace, people increasingly sort themselves into communities of choice. That is, people chose where they will live and who they will communicate with. The opportunity to make such choices appears to reinforce political culture.Bishop, The Big Sort References Bibliography * Bishop, Bill.

From the first theory in 1940s, many different ideas pertaining to how a face develops has intrigued the mind of researchers and clinicians alike. Key concepts Bone Remodeling is characterized by deposition and resorption of bone at different sites of a bone in the body. This usually leads to change in size or shape of the body. Bone Modeling is known as formation of new bone from either cartilage or by direct deposition. Growth Sites is a term proposed by Baume. Growth Sites serve as a location in the bone where the actual growth occurs. Growth sites are dependent on the growth centers for growth. Some examples include sutures of cranial vault, lateral cranial base and maxilla. Growth Centers is an area in the bone that controls the overall growth of the bone from its locations through different signaling mechanisms. Growth at these centers are genetically controlled. All growth centers can be growth sites but not all growth sites can be growth centers. Some examples include membranous bones of cranium, mandibular condyle. Genetic theory This theory was popularized by Allan G. Brodie in 1940s and it states that craniofacial growth is controlled by genetics. This theory states that genes such as Homeobox, Sonic hedgehog, Transcription factor and IHH (protein) play an important role in craniofacial development. Bone remodeling theory This theory was popularized by Brash in 1930s and it relies on three principles: 1) Appositional Growth 2) Hunterian Growth 3) Calvarial Growth. Hunterian Growth says that both maxillary and mandibular bones get bone deposition at the posterior surface. Sutural theory This theory was popularized by Sicher in 1941 which states that sutures are the primary determinant of the craniofacial growth. Expansion forces at the sutures lead to expansion of bone and thus growth of craniofacial skeleton. Cranial vault increases in size via the primary growth of bone that happens at the suture. Sicher theorized that tissues such as periosteum, Cartilage and sutures are growth centers just like epiphysis of the long bone that allow the bone to form. He said that growth of maxilla happens at expansion of the circumaxillary sutures which push maxilla down and forward. Evidence says that sutures are growth sites that respond intrinsically to signals. Cartilaginous theory This theory was popularized by Scott in 1950s and states that cartilage determines the craniofacial growth. Proponents of this theory state that cartilage is responsible for the growth and bone just replaced it. In this theory, mandibular condyle having cartilage at its end allows the downward and forward growth of the mandible. Maxilla, consisting of the nasal septum and nasomaxillary complex, which is made up of cartilage, moves forward and downward also by the forces from the nasal septum. Bones in both maxilla and mandible respond to their respective cartilaginous growth centers. To test this theory, two approaches were taken by researchers in past. Either the cartilage was removed from the nasal septum or the cartilage was transplanted into the cultures to see the effects on the growth. When the cartilage was transplanted into the in vitro cultures, it was found that the cartilage from nasal septum grew as nearly as it did in vivo. In comparison, cartilage from mandibular condyle did not grow as well. Therefore, cartilage at condyle, cranial base synchondroses and nasal septum can act as growth centers. Functional matrix theory The functional matrix hypothesis was popularized by Melvin Moss in 1962. This theory said that neither bone nor cartilage is a major determinant of growth but soft tissue is. His view stated that as soft tissues around the jaw and face grow, bone and cartilage follow the growth of these soft tissues. Dr. Profitt in his Contemporary Orthodontics textbook gave a good example of impact of brain growth on the cranial vault. He states that when the soft tissue of brain grows, the cranial vault follows the growth. Another example is hydrocephaly where increased intracranial pressure leads to increased size of the cranial vault. He also mentioned that when a condylar fracture happens in children there is a chance of about 80% that the condyle will regrow over time. However, 20% of the time the condyle does not regrow because of the extent of the injuries. The extent of trauma and soft tissue scarring can impact the healing of the fractured condyle and thus it shows the functional matrix theory working naturally in real life. Functional matrix theory states that growth of both maxillary and mandibular bones are dependent of the functional needs of tissues around the bone. Therefore, a normal function is critical to the growth of the maxilla and mandibular according to Moss. Servosystem theory This theory was popularized by Alexandre Petrovic in 1970s which stated that craniofacial growth happened because of growth signals and feedback mechanisms. Petrovich theorized a Cybernetic Model for the Servosystem Theory. This theory states that occlusion provides a constantly changing input which influences the horizontally regulated growth of the midface and anterior cranial base. This midface growth then serves as a rate limiting factor for the growth of the mandible.  Enlow's principles  There are two principles that Donald Enlow developed which are important part of the study of the craniofacial development. Enlow's V Principle is related to the bones of the craniofacial area which have a V shape configuration. We see bone resorption happening on the outer side of the \\"V\\" of the bone and bone deposition happens on the inner side of the \\"V\\". Therefore, the movement of bone happens towards the open-end of the V. Enlow's Counterpart Principle states that growth of one bone in the craniofacial area relates to the other bones in the same region. Therefore, each bone and its counterpart bone both grow to a certain extent to maintain the balanced growth. An example is the growth of maxilla corresponding to the growth of mandible.

This term applies to fictional works, but does not include folklore. History The Chuvash language is the only surviving member of the Oghur or Bulgar branch of the Turkic group of languages. Therefore, Chuvash literature begins with ancient Turkic literature. The history of Chuvash literature begins when texts in the Chuvash language first appear in historical sources. The oldest known Chuvash texts appear on the gravestones left by the Volga Bulgars in the 13th and 14th centuries in the Middle Volga region, during the reign of the Golden Horde. Most of the epitaphs on the tombstones were written in Oghur languages, of which Chuvash is the only extant member. While these epitaphs cannot be considered full-fledged literary work they do ensure that the Chuvash language of the Golden Horde is forever cemented in time. Even in their plain texts, you can find a certain artistry and in some instances there is even plot development. =The ancient Turkic literature= Modern people have learned about ancient Turkic literature mainly by studying the monuments of ancient Turkic runic writing, Manichean writing and ancient Uyghur writing. =The role of Volga Bulgars culture in the Chuvash literature= Literature created in the Chuvash language dates back to medieval Oghur language. This is the principal value of the culture of the Chuvash Volga Bulgars in the literature. Aside from the aforementioned epitaphs, there are no surviving texts in the Oghur language. Medieval translations of Oghur literature were completed, however, often based directly on the Oghur sources. Yaqub ibn Numan, who lived in the 11th century, authored the pseudo-historical work \\"History of Bulgar\\", but this work has not survived. Abu H√°mid al-Garn√°ti met with the ibn Numan and wrote a work based on \\"History of Bulgar\\". This work alludes to the animosity between the Bulgars and the Khazars, another ethnic group in Central Asia and features a narrative about how the Bulgars converted to Islam. Much of these historical events are presented by al-Garn√°ti in a mythologized form. He includes characters that are similar to characters in modern Chuvash folklore such as Ulyp, a giant and a legendary hero. =8th century - Early 19th century= Aside from the epitaphs of gravestones during the Golden Horde period (13th-14th centuries), more artistic texts in the Chuvash languages began to appear in the 18th century, with the emergence of the Chuvash alphabet. For example, one poem by an anonymous writer in 1767 praised Catherine the Great, Empress of Russia: –ü–µ–ª–º–∞—Å—Ç–∞–ø–∞—Ä –∞–±–∏—Ä—å —Ç—è –º–∏–Ω—å –±–∞—Ä–∞—Å –ø–∞—Ä–Ω—è, –°–∞–Ω–∞, —á–∏–±–µ—Ä—å –ø–∞—Ç—à–∞, –ø–æ—Ä–∞-–º—ã—Ä—ã–Ω—å –ê–Ω–Ω—è, J–æ—Ä–∞—Ç–Ω—ã—à–∞–Ω –ø–∏—Ä–µ. –ü–µ–ª–º–∞—Å—Ç–∞ –º–∞—Ä —Ö–∞–ª—å—á–µ–Ω –¢–æ—Ä–∞, —Ö—É–∂—É —Å—é–ª—å–¥–∞. –ü–µ–ª—å–∑–∞–Ω –∏ –¥–∞—Ö —á–µ—á–µ–Ω—å. –ü–∞–º–∞–ª—ã—Ö —Å—è–≤–∞–Ω–∂–µ–Ω, –Ω–∏–º–µ–Ω—å —Åj–æ–∫ —á–æ–Ω –∞–Ω—á–∞—Ö, ‚Äî –ü–∞—Ä–Ω—è –≤—ã—Ä–Ω—è –ø–æ–ª–¥–∞—Ä –≤—É–ª–¥–∞ –∞–ø–ø–∏–Ω—å —Å–∞–Ω–∞—Ö!–ù. –ò. –ò–≤–∞–Ω–æ–≤. –ßƒÉ–≤–∞—à —ÅƒÉ–≤–≤–∏. –®., 1977, 48 —Å. ‚Äî8 –°(–ß–£–í) –ò 20 Translation: We do not know what to give / You, beautiful queen, universal mother, for the love of us.

The highest achievement of the Chuvash literature of this period may be a poem by Mikhail Fedorov \\"Arzuri\\" (1848-1904). It was written in 1884, spread among the population in the lists. It was published much later, in 1908. During these years, Ignatius Ivanov (1848-1885) also wrote works of literature.

It is a day-use park within the southern tract of Thetford Hill State Forest. The park includes paths for hiking and the 5-km Woods Hill Trail, a world-class cross- country running and skiing trail. Activities includes hiking, cross-country running and cross-country skiing. The park was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002 for its historic facilities, some of which were developed by the Civilian Conservation Corps. It is currently under the care of Thetford Academy. Setting Thetford Hill State Park is located in south- central Thetford, south of the village of Thetford Hill, and directly abutting the campus of Thetford Academy to the north. It occupies part of the eastern slope of a short ridge of hills, extending to the summit areas of Sunset Hill near the northern end of the ridge. The park is bounded on the east by Academy Road, from which the main access road rises to the west. Facilities Entrance gate Although the park was originally developed with a campground, it is now a day-use park with hiking trails. The road passes through a CCC-built gate, and runs nearly directly west, passing a wood-frame ranger contact station, near which a road branches south to a campground area formerly used by a summer camp. From the contact station, a road reaches Sunset Hill, a former picnicking area that now houses an outdoor classroom for Thetford Academy. The road is crossed and recrossed several times by the Woods Hill Trail, a multi-use hiking and cross-country ski trail that extends onto the Thetford Academy campus. Near the parking area are also the fragmented remains of a CCC-built campground, in which little more than stone fireplace and dilapidated restrooms are to be found. with History Before the park was created, the land was somewhat open, having been logged in the 19th century and only partially replanted. The state acquired the land in the 1920s, donated by Thetford local Dwight Goddard, and it was developed in the mid-1930s by crews of the Civilian Conservation Corps. Facilities built out then include the road and gate, and the campground near the summit. In 1964, a new camp loop was built near the present contact station, which was also built around that time, and the old campground was abandoned.

It had been released in an open beta period in 2015, and the full game was released on April 27, 2016, Due to declining player counts, servers for Duelyst were shut down on February 27, 2020.  Gameplay  Games are played on a 5 √ó 9 grid. Here, a general's movement range is highlighted. In Duelyst, two players battle across a tactical battlefield, taking turns in which they play and position minions and spells, represented by cards drawn from a custom built deck, until one of the players eliminates the enemy general. There are six factions in Duelyst, each with its own unique characteristics that affect strategy and gameplay of the decks the player builds. The game offers a practice mode, puzzle-like challenges, a ranked season ladder and a draft-style tournament mode. Development Duelyst development was led by Keith Lee, a former lead producer at Blizzard Entertainment, who co-founded Counterplay Games. Lee cites the Fire Emblem and Front Mission series as inspirations for the game. Duelyst was designed to accommodate short play sessions, a game lasting around ten minutes on average. The game was part funded through a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign, raising $137,707 in April 2014. Originally intended to follow an up-front pricing model, the game switched to a free-to-play model in 2015. The developers believed that a free-to-play model would allow for ongoing updates to the game rather than relying on less regular expansion packs. The game entered open beta testing in October 2015, and was released in April 2016 , 2016 on both Microsoft Windows and OS X platforms. The iOS version, however, was subsequently removed, and the game exists only for Windows. The first major expansion \\"Denizens of Shim'zar\\" was released in August 2016. A second expansion, \\"Rise of the Bloodborn\\" was released in December 2016. A third, \\"Ancient Bonds\\" followed in March 2017. The fourth, \\"Unearthed Prophecy\\" was released in July 2017. The fifth, \\"Immortal Vanguard\\" was released in November 2017. The sixth and latest expansion, \\"Trial of Mythron\\" was released in November 2018. Originally self-published, it was announced in July 2017 that the game would henceforth be published by Bandai Namco Entertainment, who would take on responsibilities for marketing and customer support. Counterplay announced in January 2020 that due to declining player counts, the online servers for Duelyst will be shut down on February 27, 2020 at 3PM PST, and the game will become unplayable after that. Reception  The game was well received and holds a rating of 82/100 on reviews aggregation website Metacritic, based on 14 reviews. Tom Marks, writing in PC Gamer, described Duelyst as his favourite card game after Hearthstone and awarded the game 84% in his review. Matt Cox, in his review for Rock, Paper, Shotgun, praised Duelyst in comparison to its competitors, adding that the game \\"does so much more by slapping on a whole other game to the tried and tested CCG formula\\".

The day use area, about in size, includes a beach, picnic area with large CCC-built pavilion, and a nature center also built by the CCC. The picnic area includes fourteen stone fireplaces built by the CCC. About one mile south of the day use area is the larger parcel, which includes two camping loops and extends into the hills south of the lake. Camping facilities include 34 tent/RV sites and 37 lean- tos, rest rooms with hot showers, and a sanitary dump station. Some of the leantos were built by the CCC. with History The park was developed in 1938, and was one of the last of the Vermont state parks to be built by the Civilian Conservation Corps, a Depression-era jobs program.

History  Following the ramping up of diesel trains in the 1960s, the last steam-hauled service trains on the standard gauge mainline of the British Railways network ran in August 1968, the last train itself being the Fifteen Guinea Special on 11 August, although narrow gauge trains were still run until 1987 on the Vale of Rheidol Railway. The day after the final service, BR then imposed a complete ban on mainline steam services, with one exception, Flying Scotsman, due to Alan Pegler having secured a clause in the purchase contract when she was purchased from BR in 1963. After this time, the only place to see steam trains was on privately owned heritage railways. The ban was lifted in 1971, paving the way for the earliest post-ban heritage services. A train hauled by King George V was the first to run after the ban, and it paved the way for BR to authorise more and more routes for steam operation (based on them having the necessary infrastructure and timetabling capacity); in response to growing public demand for such services, the Steam Locomotive Operators' Association was formed in 1975 to bring together and assist operators wishing to run on the main line, negotiating a programme of tours with BR.  Operation  In the post-privatisation era, the typical manner in which mainline steam trains are operated is for a promoter or customer to contract a charter train operating company (TOC) to run it on their behalf. The TOCs are the legal entities which are licensed to operate trains; they are responsible for providing the three-man professional train crew consisting of the engine driver, fireman and traction inspector,The Railway Magazine, September 2009 issue, 5 August 2009, IPC Media, pages 40 ‚Äì 44, A week in the life of a mainline line steam support crew and negotiating access to the network from Network Rail.

Of the 410,000 miles of charter train operation in 2012/13, 103,000 of this was steam hauled.Network Rail consultation: Structure of charges for charter operators in CP5; Network Rail; 28 May 2015 Due to their unique aspects, the safe operation of steam locomotives on the mainline is governed by its own Railway Group Standard, Steam Locomotive Operation, in addition to all other applicable standards. Depending on wheel diameter, locomotives on the mainline are permitted to operate up to maximum speeds ranging from 35 to 75 mph  the maximum permitted on minor and heritage lines normally being 25 mph. With water troughs having been removed after the withdrawal of mainline steam, trains must now stop for water, being refilled via hoses from road going tankers (preferred over static hydrants due to pressure inconsistencies and the possibility of contamination), although mainline water cranes do still exist in some places.Tornado adjust the coal distribution while the tender is refilled with water by hose With the locomotives often away from their home base, or even any kind of operating base, support crews numbering around half a dozen people usually travel with the train, their role being to prepare the locomotive, tend to it on water stops and repair any fixable issues arising, and clear the ashpan as part of a disposal routine at the end of the day. As a result, as well as the passenger coaches, mainline steam trains will also feature a support coach, normally a passenger brake van of the British Railways Mark 1 or Mark 2 era, specially fitted out to provide seating/sleeping, catering and workshop facilities for the support crew, plus space to carry spares and equipment (i.e. hoses), including that required for the modern equipment needed on a mainline equipped train. While on the move, one support crew member rides on the footplate, to act as the locomotive owner's representative and assist the train crew ‚Äì who have general knowledge of steam locomotives and the UK mainline ‚Äì by offering specialist knowledge of the idiosyncrasies of the specific locomotive, and reacting to matters arising. On the move, the remaining crew in the support coach will also record the locomotive's performance while operating, including punctuality and fuel efficiency.  Locomotives  Mallard on Knaresborough viaduct in 1987 Most locomotives used are examples built during the steam era and later preserved, being suitably modified to run on the modern mainline. In 2009 the locomotive Tornado hauled its maiden mainline train, being the first brand new steam locomotive to be built in Britain for use on the main line since Evening Star, completed in 1960. The most famous steam locomotive operating on the British main line is the 1923 built Flying Scotsman. After being taken into public ownership in 2004, following a decade long refit it returned to mainline service in 2016. The fastest steam locomotive ever built, the 1938 built Mallard, was also certified for main line operation briefly in the 1980s.  Services  thumb The Jacobite, hauled by Lord of the Isles, crossing the Glenfinnan Viaduct Most steam-hauled mainline services are operated as public charters - i.e. trains organised by a tour operator and available to passengers on a pre-booked basis only. Certain services however are run as scheduled services. In some cases, trains are operated as private charters. A small number of journeys by the British Royal Train have been hauled by steam traction. Many of the services have names which echo the historic named passenger trains of the United Kingdom, and will often feature an appropriate headboard. The Jacobite is summer season daily service along the West Highland Line in Scotland, voted the most scenic in the world in 2009. The Torbay Express is a regular summer season weekend service in the South West. The Scarborough Spa Express is another regular summer season service, which was originally run in the BR era of the 1980s, before being revived again in the 2000s by various private operators. Selected services run by the luxury train operator Belmond (formerly Orient-Express) are steam hauled - the UK leg of the Venice-Simplon Orient Express, plus the British Pullman and Northern Belle. In 2007, the North Yorkshire Moors Railway, a heritage railway, gained permission from Network Rail to extend some of its steam services along a 6-mile stretch of the Esk Valley Line, from Grosmont (the NYMR northern terminus) to Whitby. This marked the first time that a volunteer run heritage railway had been allowed to operate services on NR track. In an effort to boost tourism in the summer of 2015, the Abellio ScotRail railway franchise began offering steam specials on scenic routes, although the company was criticised for having not promoted the services enough, leading to an initial shortfall in demand, which Abellio attributed to a late change of operator. The franchise also provided 3 days a week steam specials on the newly opened Borders Railway between Edinburgh and Tweedbank. Network Rail suffered heavy criticism after an error led to it proposing to cancel trips hauled by Flying Scotsman on these services with just two days notice, only to reverse their decision a day later. Hailed as a success, the Borders Railway trips returned for the 2016 season. On three consecutive days in February 2017, Northern Rail replaced two return journeys between Appleby and Skipton, normally operated by a diesel multiple-unit, with steam-hauled services worked by No. 60163 Tornado. Unlike the services described above, regular National Rail tickets were valid for travel on these trains, thus making them the first regular scheduled steam-hauled passenger trains since the end of BR steam.  Issues  Princess Elizabeth at Bristol Temple Meads during a railtour Since the lifting of the steam ban in 1971, main line steam operation had an exemplary safety record. Network Rail identify the greatest operational risk of steam locomotives on the modernised network as lineside fires, caused by embers from the fire box, since they can cause both damage to equipment and delays to services. According to Network Rail, the risk to the modern railway is higher than in the days of normal steam operation, as lineside vegetation is thicker and greener due to not being regularly burned back by lineside fires. In 2008 a locomotive was banned from the main line after causing a severe damage to a Cumbrian Coast Line wooden viaduct, although this was presumed to be due to a fault with the engine. Network Rail has issued bans on steam services running on certain parts of its network in response to lineside fires; in 2011 banning weekday services on the East Coast Main Line, and in 2014 banning all services on the LNE & East Midlands Route, although critics have described them as disproportionate and made various arguments as to how they are unjustified. In a pre-emptive measure during a heatwave in August 2013, steam services across much of the network were banned (unless hauled by a diesel over a banned section). Network Rail also pre-emptively bans steam operation in any area affected by industrial action by a Fire Brigade. The operational risks of steam locomotives on the network were highlighted to the wider public in 2015 following the Wootton Bassett SPAD incident, when a steam charter train passed a signal at danger (SPAD) near Wootton Bassett Junction. Although no collision resulted, it led to the major steam train charter operator, West Coast Railways, having their network access license suspended, and then revoked in February 2015 after further issues came to light. This resulted in serious disruption of main line steam services due to their being the largest operator in the British steam hauled market by a wide margin. Their prohibition was finally lifted in March 2016. In June 2016 the driver was sentenced to four months in prison after pleading guilty to breaches of Health and Safety law, while WCRC were fined ¬£260,000 after also admitting to two breaches. Due to the popularity of steam trains with the public, trespassing on the railway is seen as a major issue by Network Rail and the British Transport Police. The debut of Flying Scotsman resulted in Network Rail having to pay ¬£60,000 in compensation (to train operators) after 59 services were affected by a combined total of more than 8 hours of service delays. As a preventive measure, timings of its subsequent trips were deliberately not released to the public, and reminders have been issued that trespass on the railway is a criminal offence and that offenders risk a criminal record and fines of up to ¬£1,000.  Economic impact  Mainline steam operation is estimated to contribute at least ¬£30 million annually to the economy.

He is a professor of Turkish studies at Leiden University since 1997. From 2008 to 2012 he served as director of the International Institute of Social History. His book Turkey: a Modern History is considered a standard work. Z√ºrcher frequently comments on current issues related to Turkey. Career Z√ºrcher was born in 1953, the only child of Sinologist Erik Z√ºrcher (1928‚Äì2008). Z√ºrcher obtained a BA in Turkish studies from Leiden University in 1974. Three years later he received his MA in Turkish studies, with minors in both modern history and Persian. In 1984 he obtained his PhD in Turkish studies, also from Leiden University. From 1977 to 1989 Z√ºrcher was an assistant professor of Turkish and Persian at the Radboud University Nijmegen. He subsequently was employed as associate professor of modern history at the same university until 1997. From 1990 to 1999 he was a senior researcher at the International Institute of Social History. Between 1993 and 1997 Z√ºrcher was an affiliate professor of social history of the Middle East at the University of Amsterdam. In that latter year he was appointed as full professor of Turkish studies at Leiden University. Z√ºrcher was director of the International Institute of Social History between April 2008 and November 2012. Honours and distinctions In 2005, Z√ºrcher received the Distinguished Service Award of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Turkey for his work in informing the Dutch political scene and general public on Turkey. The award was presented to him by foreign minister Abdullah G√ºl. In May 2016 he returned the award, citing \\"dictatorial misgovernment\\" by the government under Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan. Z√ºrcher was elected a member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2008. Views A renowned specialist in Turkey's late modern history, \\"Z√ºrcher‚Äôs research (...) has produced a critique of the official historiography of the Turkish Republic and Turkish nationalism, depicting the national resistance movement organised by Mustafa Kemal as a rupture with the past. By undermining the standard periodisation that clearly differentiates between the Ottoman era and the newly born Republic of Turkey, Z√ºrcher demonstrated that the resistance movement was, to a large extent, started and organised by former Unionists, who were the key actors in the 1908 Constitutional Revolution and also responsible for the choices made on behalf of the Empire during World War I. According to Z√ºrcher, although the Unionist leaders, especially Talat, Enver, and Cemal pashas, had fled the country immediately after the Armistice in November 1918, the cadres in the country and the leaders from abroad were a critical part of the national resistance movement. This argument in turn supported the so-called continuity thesis between the late Ottoman Empire and the early Turkish Republic, which underscores the many political, economic, and cultural elements that continued to exist from one state formation to another.\\"Derya G√∂√ßer Akder. \\"Erik J. Z√ºrcher The Young Turk Legacy and Nation Building: From the Ottoman Empire to Atat√ºrk's Turkey\\" [review]. 'Studies in ethnicity and nationalism, vol. 11, no. 3 (2011), p. 586-588. Z√ºrcher has noted a tendency in Turkish government circles to refer nostalgically to the Ottoman Empire. According to him, this is in line with Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan's depicting of a powerful Turkey in the future, linked to a glorious empire in the past. Z√ºrcher previously pleaded for accession of Turkey to the European Union. In 2012, he noted that the perspective of accession was lost politically in both Turkey and the European Union. In 2016, he noted that his previously expected advancement in democratic standards and Rechtsstaat did not materialize, and that Turkey therefore cannot and should not become a member of the European Union. Reacting shortly after the 2016 Turkish coup d'√©tat attempt, Z√ºrcher stated that he deemed it \\"highly unlikely\\" that the G√ºlen movement was behind it. He added that the coup attempt would lead to Turkish president Erdoƒüan using the event to get rid of opponents, citing the example of arrest warrants for nearly 3000 judges.

In the 2010 July 1 demonstration, he joined the sit-in at the Central Government Offices after the demonstration. On 1 July 2011, he was one of the protesters blocked the Connaught Road Central. On 1 March 2011, Wong and another protester Wong Chun-kit protested against Chief Executive Donald Tsang when Tsang was on his way to the Hong Kong Museum of History in Tsim Sha Tsui. Wong held a box of rice with fish in corn sauce and ran towards Tsang. They were charged with hitting Tsang but later found innocent by the court. On 29 June 2012 during Chinese President Hu Jintao's visit in Hong Kong, five LSD members including Wong protested at the North Lantau Highway where Hu's car passed by. They climbed over a metal fence, scrambling onto a slope to hold up two banners reading: \\"Vindication of the June 4th crackdown\\"; and \\"Give me back [Li] Wangyang\\". They were later charged and fined for improper use of an expressway. On 11 June 2014, Wong was charged along with Scholarism convenor Joshua Wong, former secretary general of Hong Kong Federation of Students Nathan Law and People Power legislator Albert Chan for obstructing police officers when they burnt replicas of Beijing's white paper interpreting Hong Kong's one country, two systems principle during a protest outside the Liaison Office. They were later found not guilty. As a veteran activist, Wong was one of the leaders during the 2014 Hong Kong protests, which was often called the \\"Umbrella Revolution\\". He was deeply involved in the movement and was later arrested with Joshua Wong, the main leader of the protests and Chinese University's Student Union member Jason Szeto Tze-long on 25 November during the police clearance of the Mong Kok sit-in site. On 18 April 2020, Wong was arrested as one of 15 Hong Kong high-profile democracy figures, on suspicion of organizing, publicizing or taking part in several unauthorized assemblies between August and October 2019 in the course of the anti-extradition bill protests.

He graduated in law while in Urbino in 1727, then moving to Rome where he studied epigraphy. Here, with the assistance of his uncle, Fabio degli Abati Olivieri, he was able to locate rare archaeological finds which were deposited in his personal museum. In 1735, Olivieri returned to Pesaro, a date which coincides with the publication of his first antiquarian and philological work. Two years later, he completed the Marmora Pisaurensia notis, illustrated. What followed was a period intense work as evidenced by the many books he wrote. In 1756, he made a large donation to Pesaro: his library of scrolls and many thousands of works, printed and handwritten, of high value and significance for the history and culture of the city, along with a collection of antiques, consisting essentially of material dug up throughout Pesaro. This donation formed the nucleus of the Biblioteca Oliveriana. He died in Pesaro in 1789. Selected works * In festo Ascensionis Christi oratio habita in basilica Lateranensi ad sanctissimum d.n.

He was the brother of Mikhail Gorbachev's wife Raisa Titarenko (Raisa Gorbacheva). After a seven-year course he graduated from the Leningrad Naval Preparatory School, then he studied at the Leningrad Higher Naval School of Engineers of weapons, but did not graduate. Demoted to the rank of sailor he served in the North, in the Arctic. Then he moved to the Donbass, where he worked in the mines. He graduated from the Maxim Gorky Literature Institute. According to the distribution in 1965, he arrived in Voronezh. He worked as an editor of fiction in the Central Black Earth publishing house. He first offered to publish the novel Landslide which was, according to the potential publishers, weak and thus did not see the light of day. Instead Titarenko had published an adventure story for teenagers, Discoveries, Wars, Wanderings of the Admiral-Generalissimo and his –°hief of Staff on Water, on Earth and under Earth. He immediately drew the attention of readers and critics to the young author. His other novels Four to the –úarket –†lace, Miner, Nikodimov Lake, On a Small –†iece of The Universe were published in Moscow and Voronezh and achieved mass circulation.–ï–≤–≥–µ–Ω–∏–π –ú–∞–∫—Å–∏–º–æ–≤–∏—á –¢–∏—Ç–∞—Ä–µ–Ω–∫–æ He was married to the Ossetian poet Zoya Gaboeva and together they have a daughter, Irina.–£–∑–Ω–∏–∫ —Å–µ–º—å–∏ –ì–æ—Ä–±–∞—á—ë–≤—ã—Ö. –ó–∞ —á—Ç–æ –±—Ä–∞—Ç–∞ –†–∞–∏—Å—ã –ú–∞–∫—Å–∏–º–æ–≤–Ω—ã –¥–µ—Ä–∂–∞—Ç –≤ –ø—Å–∏—Ö—É—à–∫–µ? After their divorce, Titarenko thought to create a new family, but all his attempts ended in failure. According to one version, none of the women he pursued could accept the way of life of the writer. On the other hand, the security services deliberately guided of all the ladies away from his Gorbacheva's brother. Titarenko suffered from chronic alcoholism. Every year, his condition only worsened. Around 1989 Titarenko finally moved to the hospital. The official diagnosis was organic brain damage, Alzheimer's disease. Initially, the writer settled into very good conditions in a private room with a refrigerator. He was visited by comrades from his literary workshop, but he gradually ceased to receive visitors in the hospital. Gorbacheva herself as her husband was high up in the national government, never visited him there. However she related in her memoirs... My brother was a gifted, talented person. But his talents did not come true. His talent has appeared unclaimed and ruined. Brother and drink for many months spent in the hospital. His fate a drama of mother and father. It is my constant pain that I carry in my heart for more than 30 years. I worry about his bitter tragedy, especially as a child we were very close, has always been between us a special emotional connection and attachment... is hard and painful.

The building, designed by architect Lawrence J. Barnard, was completed in 1924 and is an architecturally significant example of the Italian Renaissance style in New Rochelle. Although it has been altered, these changes occurred only on the Le Count Place fa√ßade and the interior of the building. The original Standard Star building exterior remains largely unchanged. It is further historically significant for its association with a long-published New Rochelle newspaper covering life in New Rochelle. History The Standard Star building was built in 1924 and designed by Lawrence L. Barnard and built by George Watson. Barnard is a familiar name in New Rochelle, but few references to his history or work were found; he appears to have been a partner in Barnard and Wilder who designed New Rochelle‚Äôs Fire Station No 3 in 1912, also in the Italian Renaissance Style. The Standard-Star was founded in 1923 and first published on July 2 of that year with the merging of New Rochelle‚Äôs two prior daily papers, ‚ÄúThe Standard‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Star‚Äù. Its first publisher was T. Harold Forbes. Forbes, the son of George M. Forbes, also a newspaper publisher, was a vaudeville actor and dancer who appeared with George M. Cohan in several productions.New York Times, George Watson 77, Banker and Builder Obituary, October 13, 1939.. The Standard-Star ceased publication in 1998 and was succeeded by the Westchester Journal News, a Gannett publication. About the Standard-star. Chronicling America, Library of Congress. https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83031338/ . Architectural detail The building rests on a polished granite foundation with a cast stone finish. The windows and transoms are of a cast metal with a green bronze finish. The central entry‚Äôs design creates the appearance of a double-height arched doorway. The round arched entry is classically decorated and all of the trim and decoration is of cast metal. The formal entry led to the main business area and is flanked by un-ornamented, symmetrical openings. That to the south was designed as an entry to the upper story offices; the corresponding window to the north initially housed an illuminated bulletin board that provided the news of the day. The north side of the building is articulated as a series of arched openings at both stories designed to flood the work spaces with natural light. The original Standard Star Building has been altered and added to over the course of the twentieth century. Building data cards for the property indicate additions and alterations were made to the building in 1931 and 1946. More alterations are logged from 1949, 1966, 1968, and 1978. The last date was perhaps the most significant, when an addition was built off the rear of the building (facing the Le Count Place side of the lot) to house a restaurant and bar. In 2001, the restaurant was converted into a nightclub.

The film debuted in Afghanistan and received recognition in March 2015 at the Women's day celebration film competition in Mazar-i-Sharif and won Best Film Prize.http://miriamfilmsfa.blogspot.dk/?m=1 It featured in the December 2015 East Van Short Film Showcase in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada and in the October 2015 International Women's Film Festival in Herat, and was projected among the finalists in the \\"Social Theme\\" section in the June 2016 Tracce Cinematografiche Film Fest in Rome. It won the 2016 \\"Audience Choice: Experimental Film\\" award of the Women's Voices Now online film festival and received another \\"Best Experimental Film Award\\" from Poland's 25th Euroshorts Film Festival.  Reception  Nick Wangersky of Hollywood North Magazine felt that \\"in spite of the way they‚Äôre treated at times\\", woman do matter. He called Rauff's project an \\"artistic film\\", and expanded that it \\"states that women should be allowed to make decisions too.\\" He further felt the film a \\"very innovative and bold way of showing how to show what‚Äôs really behind the vileness of individuals as well as how women struggle in Islamic countries.\\" Misty Layne of Cinemaschminema highly praised the film, writing it \\"has got to be one of the most beautiful films under 3 minutes I‚Äôve ever seen. Shot entirely in black and white, out in the desert, it shares a beautiful message about women leading women, women following in the footsteps of those who fought before them for equal rights, etc. Seriously.

No Woman is an artistic first three-minute short film with a community orientated story which is beyond the level of awareness of its audience in our society and other societies as well. In the last fifteen years, no films have been made outside political attractions and formats. All have been made into the base of market demand. Success of No Woman comes with a fresh western prespictves and looks: in the sense that no elements in the making of the film can be ignored from the perspective of a film critic, Unless it be taken simplistic, not profound.\\" Synopsis Two girls standing in the desert on a road that has a sign it shows that no women are allowed to cross the line. One of them walks alone and reaches an armed person in the middle of the road with a mask. she rips the mask off and keeps walking as the person gets into his knees and cries in the road behind her. Then it shows group of girls come to the same road, they hear a gun shot, not sure of what to do. Then they see a floating mask in the wind. Theme No Woman shines the spotlight on the big \\"no\\" that is given to women in Islamic societies, when it comes to making decisions for themselves. Majority of women suffers from inequality, but few stands to fight against it. No Woman shows few girls on screen, but it represents story of almost every women and their aspirations and obstacles.

Early life Zaidee Jackson was born in Augusta, Georgia in the winter of 1898 to C.J. and Alice Jackson, who were both sharecroppers in Berrien County, Georgia. Sometime after moving to Europe, she began using 1900 as her birth year. Zaidee had three older siblings, Ora Lee, Era and Sol Jackson. Sometime in late 1900, Alice left her husband and children, taking only Zaidee, and moved north to Boston, Massachusetts, where she met and married Fred Williams. Zaidee soon took her stepfather's last name. In 1902, Alice and Fred had their own child, Corinna. In 1923, Zaidee married James Jackson, but the marriage was brief. Around that time, she met pianist Lawrence Brown, who had been working as an elevator operator and studying in Boston, and who was soon touring England with Roland Hayes. Career =Early career (1924‚Äì1927)= In 1924, Jackson was a part of the Andrew Bishop Players, touring throughout the Southern United States. In 1925, she joined Walter Sweatman's revue with bandleader Claude Hopkins in a tour of Canada. Eventually Claude left the revue to join the new show, La Revue Negre, in Paris. Jackson departed as well, obtaining a part in the cast of the half-white, half-black show Lulu Belle at New York's Belasco Theatre with actress Evelyn Preer. The show was a huge success, and Jackson was especially singled out for her dancing. Later in November, film director Oscar Micheaux hired the entire cast to appear in his film The Spider's Web, which is now lost. In early 1927, she was playing with Adelaide Hall in Desires of 1927. During the summer, after a short tour, she appeared in Lyle and Miller's Rang Tang, this time featured as a singer. After the show, Lawrence Brown, who was touring Europe with Paul Robeson, convinced Jackson to come to Paris, leave behind the racism of the US and trade on the French fascination for \\"negro\\" culture. She arrived in Paris around November 1927. =French and British career (1928‚Äì1933)= Jackson arrived in France during the winter of 1927, joining her friend, Lawrence Brown in Paris. By February 25, 1928, she found employment at the Kit Kat Club for a few weeks before touring with a band around the French coast: Deauville, Cannes, Biarritz. Her performances seemed to spark interest with numerous members of the British elite such as Elsa Maxwell, the Duke of Kent, and especially the Countess of Carnarvon who purchased Jackson a plane ticket to London in May. On June 9, Jackson became a popular fixture at the Uncles Club. By June 21, she was appearing at the Piccadilly Hotel, where she remained throughout the summer of 1928. After hours, she could be seen roaming the streets with Paul Robeson, Lawrence Brown and even Leslie Hutchinson, another colored singer working in London. On August 28, accompanied by Carroll Gibbons on piano, Jackson recorded \\"St. Louis Blues\\" and \\"Didn't I Tell You?\\" with HMV Records. However the records were never released. By September 5, in between her performances, she would visit the seventh floor of Marconi House in London's Strand, where the new British Broadcasting Company had its headquarters. From September 19 until the 29th, after a brief piano and vocal test, Jackson recorded the song \\"Waterboy\\" with the Duophone Recording Company. However, the song was rejected. Her radio concerts of American folk songs and ballads drew even more curiosity among the British populace. One of her radio shows was heard by Alban B. Limpus, British theatre director, who offered Jackson a role in May Edgington's new play Deadlock. On October 4, Deadlock opened at the Comedy Theatre (October 4‚Äì20), with Jackson preceding the play performing a selection of spirituals. On October 9, with Duophone Records, Jackson recorded all four songs she performed in the play. After the play closed, Jackson made frequent trips between Paris and London on the Imperial Air Lines. During her Parisians excursions, while preparing for an upcoming revue, she witnessed Afro-British pianist Reginald Forsythe performing in local club and was eager to recruit him as her new pianist. On October 24, her revue at the Piccadilly Hotel opened, with Forsythe accompanying her on piano. During the course of the revue, Forsythe struck up a friendship with leading Harlem musical theatre tenor, Walter Richardson, who had come to London to play Uncle Ned in Virginia, a musical comedy which opened at the Palace Theatre on October 24. Forsythe was invited by Richardson (and his wife) to become his new accompanist much to Jackson's dismay and they embarked on a tour abroad. On November 10, Jackson was back in Paris, entertaining at La Plantation Club with Eddie South's Alabamians. The following day, she opened at London's Caf√© Anglais (November 11‚Äì18). and appeared on BBC Radio's Rhymes and Rhythm show (November 21). Throughout November, Jackson and her Midnight Orchestra recorded four songs with the German-British record label Parlophone Records. On January 8, 1929, Jackson recorded \\"Ready for the River\\" with Metropole Records. That same day, four more songs were recorded with Duophone, which were never released. Afterwards, Jackson returned to Paris, where she was engaged at Ada \\"Bricktop\\" Smith's popular Montmartre nightclub. Shortly afterwards, she purchased a comfortable apartment on the Rue Chalgrin, a small right-angle street in the Chaillot district, where she held intimate cocktail parties before whisking her guests over to the Bal Negre cabaret to dance the Biguine. On April 6, Jackson opened her own small nightclub, Chez Za√Ød√©e, imitating Josephine Baker's own French nitery. Throughout the spring of 1929, she was invited to sing at Countee Cullen's small house party near the rue Pigalle and at black dancer Louis Cole's birthday party at his large apartment near the Trocadero. In May, she was performing at the Boeuf sur le Toit nightclub. On July 13, she flew back to London for her usual radio appearances. Around this time, she was introduced to Guy Robson, who flew Jackson constantly in his private plane, occasionally showing off with his stunt flying. Returning to Paris, she was engaged at Floresco's Bomboniere, which promptly ended on July 27 after she sprained her ankle. On September 10, she was once again broadcasting on BBC Radio, appearing alongside Williams & Taylor, Jackson & Blake, Leslie Hutchinson and the Kentucky Singers. On November 9, Jackson's manager E.J. Bonner arranged for her open in Manchester, appearing at the Lewis Department store dance-hall. She was soon given the opportunity of a short tour of England, who had already heard her on their radio transmissions. Early 1930, Jackson spent two weeks at the Manchester Hippodrome (January 1‚Äì22), she then returned to London on January 27 to record fours songs for Parlophone before departing for a week in Bristol (January 27‚ÄìFebruary 1). Returning to London, The Stage Newspaper wrote positive reviews about her week engagement at the Hackney Empire Theatre (March 1‚Äì13), singing syncopated songs at (and away from) the piano. On March 27, Jackson was in Blackpool opening her own revue at the Blackpool Palace, Singer from Southland, in which she performed Akst & Clarke's \\"Am I Blue?\\". In April, she returned to London to record two songs for Parlophone, but she didn't record \\"Am I Blue?\\". The revue ran for a successful three months before closing early June. On June 5, she was back in Paris, entertaining at the Boeuf sur le Toit. However, on June 9, she was in London, recording two songs for Parlophone. On June 13, Jackson, eager to establish herself more in mainland Europe, returned to Paris in June with a four-month contract at the exotic Russian cabaret, Sheherazade. In July she returned to London, to record two songs accompanied by Reginald Forsythe and later two more in August. That winter it was arranged for Jackson to appear in Berlin. On November 7, She appeared at the famous Kabarett der Komiker (November 7‚Äì22). However, she was given mixed reviews for her singing, which some Germans felt was barely audible. On January 9, 1931, she opened back in Paris at the L'Ange Bleu Bar (January 9-23). Her appearance there was well received and afterwards she departed again. On January 31, Jackson opened at Budapest's Royal Hotel accompanied by Russian pianist, Suponitzkaya (January 31-February 1). Back in Paris for the Paris Colonial Exposition, on June 23, she opened at the new cabaret, La Jungle-Montmartre, performing her intimate songs with Reginald Foresythe beside her with his piano. However, eventually her companion Reggie was whisked away again with another band for a tour of the US. On November 6, as the Exposition closed that winter, she was appearing at the New Marine Club. Meanwhile, George White offered her some of the music scores from his Broadway production, Scandals of 1931, probably with the intention of her joining the show. Early 1932, Jackson departed for Cannes to open her own cabaret, Sous le Maquis, hoping to have Josephine Baker as her headliner. The establishment was briefly successful, but she eventually decided to return to Paris. On May 5, she began a five- month residency at the Le Bosphore club, performing for her friends, Pizella, Maurice Chevalier and Prince Yusupov. Ten days later, she also opened at Chez Zelli's for a six-month residency. On July 4, she added La Sheherazade cabaret to her nightly circuit, singing and dancing eccentrically for five months. In August, Jackson departed for St. Jean de Luz for a month's engagement at the Maxim Club (August 13‚ÄìSeptember 1). The following month, while performing a \\"Russian Act\\" at the Sheherazade, she planned for a trip to Moscow, which never came together. On December 22, Jackson returned to appear in Ballyhoo Revue, which opened at the Comedy Theatre to immense success with the British public. On March 10, 1933, Jackson recorded with Parlophone the comedy number, \\"Pink Elephants\\" and another number, \\"I've got the Wrong Man\\" both of which she performed in the revue. In the meantime, film director Andrew Buchanan took her on screen, appearing in two short films with the Ideal Cine-Magazine, I've Got the Wrong Man and Black Magic. On the 24th, she recorded three more songs, this time with Decca Records. On May 20, she was back in Paris, appearing at the Robinson Club. The following night, she returned to the Sheherazade cabaret for a six-month residency accompanied by a Romanian orchestra. On June 3, Jackson also appeared in the extravagant revue, Au Dela... des Reins at Joe Zelli's latest cabaret, Chez Les Nudistes. Every evening for five months, she performed her sultry numbers completely nude for the Parisian audiences. In August 1933, she returned to St. Jean de Luz, for a month's engagement at the Auberge club (August 22‚ÄìSeptember 20). By time she returned to Paris, the Montmartre nightclub was beginning to die down. On September 10, Jackson appeared at the Grand Ecart Restaurant and later performed in an artistic gala held at Le Bosphore Cabaret on October 6. =Monte Carlo & Switzerland (1934‚Äì1935)= The Depression finally arrived in France in 1934, causing the economy to fall apart and public demonstrations all across France. Jackson's appearances became sparse. On May 13, she appeared at a seaside casino in Juan-les-Pins. Jackson then left for Monte Carlo to open a new nightclub, where she danced, sang and entertained, imitating Bricktop. Months later, she re-appeared in Paris, performing at the Hotel Ritz on November 29. On December 11, she was back in Monaco, performing at the Knickerbocker Club before returning to Paris on December 21 for a Gala Artistique held at the Le Bosphore cabaret. In May 1935, Jackson left France with Benny Peyton's Orchestra for an engagement in Lausanne, Switzerland. The following month, she appeared on her own in Ouchy (June 17‚Äì26) and Berne (June 26). During August, she returned to France for a month's engagement at St. Jean de Luz's Auberge cabaret. In September, she returned to Switzerland to appear in Neuchatel (September 24‚Äì25). She ended 1935 in Paris, singing at Fred Payne's Bar (December 21). =Romania (1936‚Äì1939)= After a few months, as business had not recovered in the Montmartre, Jackson departed for Bucharest, Romania, immersing herself in Romanian nightlife, performing at La Zissu Musichall, on the Calea »òerban VodƒÉ, with Jean Moscopol and appearing frequently at the Maxim Zig-Zag, Barul Melody and Mon Jardin nightclub. Soon she was introduced to Barbu Neam»õu, a wealthy Romanian mechanical engineer who was a great sportsman and Ford representative. Shortly after meeting, they travelled together to marry in his ancestral city of Craiova of 100,000 in the midst of a rich agricultural area, where she was the only Negro. Her in-laws, particularly Mother Neam»õu, disapproved of her son marrying a black music hall star. They often stayed in their smart apartment in central Bucharest. Since her new husband was quite wealthy, the couple purchased and occasionally occupied their country estate near Craiova. During the winter of 1937, Octavian Goga was appointed Prime Minister, and issued a series of Anti- Semitic laws. In Bucharest, during the \\"Expozi»õie Na»õionale\\", Anti-Semitic and even pro-Fascist-themed displays were on exhibit. But it was over by the spring of 1938, when Goga died of a stroke. Jackson's marriage was marred by jealousy and racial prejudice of her husband's numerous family (and the neighbors) who felt that he had married beneath him. He was accused of renouncing his family for a Negro. The monarchy made it difficult for him to get work papers; The fascist regime of the 1940s was worse, demanding that one be an \\"Ethnic Romanian.\\" However, during this period of unhappiness, she was able to arrange a brief American tour. After ten years abroad, Jackson debarked in New York from the SS Queen Mary, appearing in numerous nightclubs that would permit her during the winter of 1937. Upon arrival, she was met by American journalists, such as those of the Pittsburgh Courier: \\"Zaidee Williams Jackson was singing sweet songs at Chez Florence in Montmartre when we met her. A slim bronze young woman, who had Paris by its ears. We wonder if anyone who has lived over there for ten years as she has can come back here to prejudice and hate and pick up where she left off. We don't doubt that she'll return where, she says 'her work is more appreciated... and more lucrative.'\\" Eventually she invited Barbu along from Romania to enjoy the sights America had to offer. During the course of the tour, Jackson paid a visit to her family in Connecticut. She sailed back to Europe by August. She appeared \\"sharp & ready\\" at Jimmy Monroe's Swing Club as well as in Harlem au Coliseum at the Paris-Coliseum alongside Myrtle Watkins, Three Dukes and the Willie Lewis Orchestra. After an appearance at Fred Payne's Bar, she returned home to Bucharest in February 1939, where she is listed as having joined the National Liberal Party. In late 1939, immediately after the Polish invasion, the Germans slowed down, quietly turning their attentions to Scandinavia, giving much of Europe the false sense of security known as the \\"Drole Guerre\\" (Phony War). In Paris, soldiers were on every corner, and young men stood in long lines to enlist. Most American entertainers fled back to the United States. However, Jackson was having success in Romania, despite the war just across the border. =World War II (1940‚Äì1945)= Unlike in Paris, the swastika flew beside the Romanian flag. King Carol made it no secret that he supported the Nazis. As the war continued, Jackson kept busy, performing every night at the La Zissu cabaret. In the summer of 1940, King Carol soon handed over Bessarabia to the Soviet Union, causing uproar across Romania, especially as fleeing Bessarabian refugees crowded the streets of Bucharest. To get away from the occasionally crowded city, Jackson often departed to their countryside estate in Craiova, where Barbu spent much of his time running his business, probably more now since the Ford-Romania Company began providing military-grade vehicles for the Germans. On September 4, the Iron Guard and General Ion Antonescu united to form a \\"National Legionary State\\" government, which forced the abdication of King Carol II in favor of his 19-year-old son Michael. On October 8, German troops began crossing into Romania and soon numbered over 500,000. Although Jackson herself encountered no real trouble, she found it expedient to stay away from public places. In 1943 Romania became a target of Allied aerial bombardment, such as the attack on the oil fields of Ploie»ôti on August 1, 1943. Bucharest was subjected to intense bombing on April 4 and 15, 1944. Amidst shortages, formerly well-to-do people carried their dwindling stock of goods to the immense open-air market to sell, in order to keep alive. Until 1954, food was scarce and expensive. =Communist Romania (1948‚Äì1956)= Jackson's troubles began after the Romanian Communist Party came to power in 1948. Around this, many popular establishments closed down after the Nationalization of all businesses in Romania. Much of Europe's audiences were in desperate need of entertainment since the end of the war, and despite occasional censorship for 'decadence', Jackson remained popular with the Romanian public throughout the 1950s, according to Dan Mihaescu, later scriptwriter for TV-Romania. \\"For a time, I could get no work at all,\\" she said, \\"until 1950, and then only sporadically, and for a miserable pittance of 600 leis monthly.\\" Nightly taxi cabs to and from, her jobs cost 30 leis daily, which meant spending two-thirds of her salary for transportation. Often she chose to walk two miles in the dead of night from her apartment to save money to eat since meals were no longer supplied to artists. The average worker got 500 leis monthly wage. At first they gave her laborer's pay, but later upped her wage to 1,500 leis monthly. Even after she began to get regular work, Zaidee encountered prejudice and discrimination from musicians and managers. During this time, she wrote constantly to Lawrence Brown, who was again touring Europe with Paul Robeson. She described the devastation the German bombs caused to Bucharest during the war and her struggle to find work now with the Communists in charge. In 1950, the Securitate (secret police) came in the dead of night, flashing torches in their faces, threatening. The government branded Barbu as \\"Bourgeois\\", so they were always fearful. Although engineers were in great demand, he could get very little work. One had to be \\"approved.\\" A few months later Barbu was arrested as a \\"bourgeois spy\\". Their estate in Craiova was seized (ownership of private property was banned) and Barbu was held incommunicado locally for eighteen months and then sent to an Internment camp where he was ill-fed and given the most arduous physical tasks. There was never a charge or a trial. After four years he was released, broken and impoverished, in early 1955. Zaidee was left jobless for six months, until the government relented and allowed her work more or less regularly. Even after getting regular work in 1951, Jackson encountered prejudice and discrimination from musicians and managers. Jackson believed she could obtain more money by touring abroad in America, but she had difficulty in getting out of Romania, primarily by her marriage. Although an American woman marrying a foreigner supposedly retains her U. S. citizenship, in 1951 she was listed us a Romanian and as such could not get out. At first the U.S. Embassy was sympathetic but later became un cooperative due to the antagonism of a Hungarian woman secretary. Meanwhile, her sister, Corinna Williams- Thomas, was working indefatigably in her behalf, although writing to President Truman produced no results. Jackson wrote to Paul Robeson and William Patterson, who were both known to be close with the Communists. Neither deigned to reply. Then, in April 1955, Corinna Thomas wrote to President Eisenhower who promised prompt action. =Later career= In January 1956, as the result of an appeal filed by the American Civil Liberties Union with the board of Immigration Appeals, the US State Department permitted Jackson to return to the United States. From Bucharest she flew to Amsterdam and changed planes directly for New York, where she was greeted with an American passport. She luckily missed the Red Scare movement, although there was still heavy prejudice against Communists (and those who had lived for several years in a Communist country). Jackson resumed her career on the American stage, 17 years since 1938. Her return to the American stage may have caused more strain on her already shaky marriage, caused the couple to eventually separate. Her time in America is not well documented since her return, except for an appearance in Boston in 1957 and a brief interview in Harlem during the summer of 1967, with Frank Driggs. Zaidee Jackson died on December 15, 1970, near her sister's family in Connecticut.

Gender- segregated seating within synagogues was common from the early Middle Ages well into the modern period. The firzogerin stood in the front of the women's gallery, balcony, or annex and translated the Hebrew prayers into the vernacular language for the other women who had come to pray. Sometimes the firzogerin translated more or less exactly; other times she translated freely and added her own interpretation. This parallel prayer system was probably welcome to women for whom the Hebrew liturgy, due to their lack of education, was largely incomprehensible. The firzogerin attained her status because she was more knowledgeable than most women, often acquiring her knowledge of Hebrew and the intricacies of rabbinic Judaism from her husband, father, or other learned relative. It was not unusual for this position to be held consecutively by several generations of women of a particular family. Besides reciting prayers for and mentoring other female members of the community, firzogerin would sometimes write their own prayers (called tkhines) as well as poems. On rare occasions women precentors may have led a second prayer service apart from the one organized by men.  Origin  The origin of women precentors in synagogues is directly related to the adoption of gender- segregated ritual space for rabbinic Jewish practice. Although the first historical evidence of gender-separation appears as early as the eighth century in Karaite synagogues, the first direct discussion of gender segregation by rabbis appears in the tenth century. By the mid-fifteenth century, gender-segregation was accepted as commonplace. This evolved into a Jewish tradition under the rabbis of the Geonic era (), spreading on migration and trade routes, as well as through the correspondence of rabbinic responsa between Jewish communities. The first historically recognizable women precentors emerge soon after the Weibershul annex of the Worms Synagogue was established, . This annex, unlike a veiled or gated me·∏•itsa was a separate structure. (A similar annex was built in the Frankfurt Synagogue.) Both Dulcie (wife of Rabbi Eliezer of Worms) and Urania bat Abraham served as precentors in the Worms weibershul. Richenza is mentioned in the yizkor book of Nuremberg. Marat Guta bat R. Nathan (d. 1308) was another of the early firzogerin of whom it was written: \\"she prayed from the women in her lovely prayer.\\" The phenomenon of women precentors continued to develop and spread geographically. Examples are found across Europe, the Mediterranean and the Americas, as well as among Ashkenazim and Sephardim. (Firzogerin and synonymous titles were unique to Ashkenazi communities.) Female precentors appear to have flourished most in Eastern Europe, reaching their apex during the 18th and 19th centuries, just prior to the emergence of Judaism's liberal and egalitarian movements.  Examples  The most famous firzogerin was the ·∏§assidic rebbe, Hannah Rochel Verbermacher (1815‚Äì1888), the only child of a wealthy merchant from Ludmir, Volhynia where she had her own shtiebel (called the Gornshtibl). Fanny Neuda (1819-1894), may have composed and collected the supplicatory prayers she later published in her bestelling Stunden der Andacht (1855), while serving as the firzogerin of the synagogue of her husband, Rabbi Abraham Neuda in Lo≈°tice. Earlier examples of firzogerin include Rebbetsin Serril Rappaport of Oleksiniec (daughter of the Dubner Maggid, ca. late 18th c.), Rachel Mendes Meza (18th century) of Jodensavanne, Leah Dreyzl (early 18th century, wife of R' Aryeh Leib Auerbach) of Stanislov, Toybe [Pan] (17th century, wife of Yankev Pan) of Prague, Deborah Ascarelli (sixteenth century) of Rome, and Rebecca Tiktiner (d. 1550, daughter of Rabbi Meir Tiktiner) of Prague. Though specific names have not yet been identified, instances of Jewish women precentors also occurred in 17th century Ottoman Constantinople and Salonika.

Members of this gens are first mentioned at the time of the Second Punic War. Although several of them performed useful service to the Roman state, none of the Magii ever held the consulship.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. II, p. 899 (\\"Magia Gens\\"). Origin The Magii were from Campania, and at the time of the Second Punic War they were among the leading families at Capua. That conflict divided the Magii, some of whom wished to ally with Hannibal, while others supported the alliance with Rome. One of them bore the surname Atellanus, having come from the Campanian town of Atella, perhaps the family's ultimate origin. Minatus Magius, an ancestor of the historian Velleius Paterculus, received the Roman franchise as a result of his loyal service to Rome during the Social War. His surname, Aeculanensis, suggests that a branch of the Magii settled at Aeculanum during the second century BC. Praenomina The earliest Magii appearing in history were Campanians, and bore distinctly Oscan praenomina, such as Decius and Minatus, as well as the more familiar Gnaeus, which was also a common Latin name. The Roman Magii used Publius, Lucius, Gnaeus, and Numerius, of which the last was relatively scarce at Rome, especially among the aristocracy, although more widespread among the plebeians and in the countryside.

He was the meddix turicus, or chief magistrate, at Capua in 214 BC.Livy, xxiv. 19. * Decius Magius, leader of the pro-Roman party at Capua during the Second Punic War. He argued strenuously against the city's surrender to Hannibal in 216 BC, but was sent to Carthage after the city opened its gates to the Carthaginian.

Airport baggage incident  In the early hours of 28 March 2016, Leung Chung-yan, the daughter of Hong Kong Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying, became embroiled in a controversy at Hong Kong International Airport. Leung Chung-yan had reportedly left her hand baggage in the departure hall after she had passed through the security checkpoint to board a flight for San Francisco. According to Apple Daily, witnesses alleged that his wife Regina Tong, who accompanied her daughter to the airport, engaged in a lengthy argument with airport staff to have staff reunite her daughter with her missing bag. Staff insisted on upholding procedure, which required that the passenger exit the secured zone to recover the missing item and pass through security again. Leung Chung-yan reportedly telephoned her father to seek help in resolving the impasse. The phone was given to airline staff, who brought Leung her bag, making clear that they had made an exception to procedure. Leung boarded her flight minutes later. Leung Chun-ying denied that he had abused his power by ordering airline staff to retrieve Chung-yan's bag in violation of security guidelines. Following the news of the incident, the Airport Authority Hong Kong issued a statement stating that it was not against existing procedure for someone other than the passenger to retrieve any missing baggage from airport security and bring it into the restricted area after a security check. In response, Tam launched an online petition, calling the incident a serious violation of airport security guidelines and claiming that Leung Chun-Ying had abused his power as Chief Executive, thereby setting a dangerous precedent for future incidents. The petition accrued over 36,000 signatures. Tam then submitted the jointly signed petition to three international aviation organisations: the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the Airports Council International (ACI), of which Hong Kong International Airport is a member, and the International Air Transport Association (IATA), with which a number of airlines have business. Tam also submitted the petition to two United States aviation agencies, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), because Leung Chun-yan's flight landed in San Francisco. Two months after the petition had been submitted, the ICAO had not given Tam a response. Tam travelled to ICAO's Asia-Pacific headquarters in Thailand to personally resubmit the petition to an ICAO officer to be delivered to the ICAO Secretary-General.  Political career  Tam became involved in politics when he joined the historic 2003 1 July protests, which drew more than 500,000 people against the legislation of the Hong Kong Basic Law Article 23. He followed his role model, legislator Margaret Ng to join the Civic Party, which derived from the Article 45 Concern Group emerged from the 2003 protests. In 2007, Tam ran as an independent candidate to represent Tung Chung North in that year's District Council elections. In subsequent elections, he ran as a Civic Party candidate, first in 2011 to represent Tung Chung North in its District Council, then in 2012 to represent Kowloon East in the Legislative Council. In 2015, Tam ran in the Laguna City District Council election, also being the only candidate failing to get a seat with over 3,000 votes. Tam stood in the 2012 Legislative Council election to represent Kowloon East on the second place of the Civic Party's list after party leader Alan Leong and helped secure Leong's re-election. In the 2016 Legislative Council Election, Leong stepped down to the second place on the list to stand behind Tam. In 2014, Tam became the Vice-Chairman of the Civic Party's Kowloon East Branch. Tam has expressed concerns about transportation, environmental protection, land planning, and animal rights issues. In the 2016 Hong Kong Legislative Council election, he was elected through Kowloon East. In 2019, during the anti-ELAB movement, Tam, together with Mohan Chugani and Phillip Khan, had been sprayed by the police's water cannon at the Kowloon Masjid and Islamic Centre. Water cannon incident The moment that Jeremy Tam and other victims were shot by the Police's water cannon outside the Kowloon Mosque. Jeremy Tam was one of the victims of the Water cannon incident on October 20, 2019. The Police's water cannon attacked Kowloon Mosque on that day and Jeremy Tam was one of the victims being shot. Other victims include Phillip Khan and Mohan Chugani. Phillip Khan said that the attack is an insult against Islam.

The Trek line was developed in the late 1980s with some early model prototypes. The first official model year began in 1991 and ended in 2001 under the Safari Motorcoach Corporation banner. In 2001 SMC was purchased by Monaco Coach who took over the production of subsequent model years. The early pre-Monaco Trek's now hold a venerated status among Safari RV enthusiasts-\\"Trekkies\\".Wegzell, Brian. \\"The History of Safari Motorhomes 1987-2001\\", Safari Trails This is in part due to the Trek's patented \\"Electro- Majic Bed\\" which provided for spacious floor plans. There was as well an exceptionally high build quality that used a riveted aluminum outer skin in lieu of the more popular tin or fiberglass, real hardwood cabinetry, and a small bus like design that made the Trek easy to drive and maneuver. In 2009 Monaco Coach filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy ending the \\"Safari Trek\\" line of motorhomes. The exact production numbers of the early pre-Monaco Treks have never been officially released, but estimated to be approximately 200 per year at peak production during the ten-year run. Much of this is derived from former employees and customers who took the factory tours that Safari Motorcoach Corporation would give to potential buyers. Since there is no official registry, it is difficult to know how many are still on the road today. History Safari Motorcoach Corporation (SMC) and the Trek line of motorhomes was the brainchild of Mat Perlot,Mathrew Murry Perlot, Obituary, The Oregonian former marketing manager for Beaver Motorcoach Corporation. When Beaver Coach decided to pass on creating a Class A motorhome with a $80,000 to $120,000 price point, Mat Perlot along with Curt Lawler, also a Beaver Coach employee, left to create Safari Motorcoach Corporation. Legend has it that Mat Perlot felt there were many young drivers who wanted a smaller RV with the same quality of the larger, higher priced units.Wigzel, Brian. \\"The History of Safari Motorhomes 1987-2001\\" Safari Trails After studying some of the space saving features of the Class C coaches like the overhead bunk, Perlot conceived of a pull down mechanical bed which would be tucked away in the ceiling when not in use.\\"Wigzell, Brian. The History of Safari Motorhomes 1987-2001\\">text of the citation They called it the \\"Electro-Majic Bed\\". This innovation in the Class A motorhome allowed for the elimination of a separate rear bedroom and opened up space in the living quarters while maintaining a small 24 foot length. The inaugural 1991 model year also came in a 28-foot model for those who wished to have a separate rear bedroom. Although dealers were skeptical, Mat Perlot's intention was to build an RV for weekend use and priced for volume sales.Wigzell, Brian. The History of Safari Motorhomes 1987-2001 There were various technical issues to make the Electro-Majic Bed work; however, through trial and error these were resolved with the 1991 model year which had an electric motor made by Somfy that was powerful enough to raise and lower the 250 pound bed. Once the dealers started supporting this new concept and market segment, something interesting happened once the Trek's started selling. Though designed for short term weekend use with its novel bed and small footprint, a surprising number of people started using the Trek full-time and for extended time periods.Wigzell, Brian. \\"The History of Safari Motorhomes 1987-2001\\" Trek ownership continued to grow and soon Trek clubs started to form. Owners were proud of the quality construction and the fact that they had a 24 or 28 foot model that felt more like a 30 or 35 foot coach. The Electro-Majic Bed had become so popular among consumers that it was also added to Safari's Kalahari line of motorhomes in 1993. Model Years The 1991 Safari Trek was the first year of production which used the Isuzu NPR truck chassis. This was a 3.9 Liter turbocharged four cylinder diesel engine (4BD1T) with 126HP output mated to a four speed automatic Jatco transmission with overdrive. The Isuzu NPR provided 14mpg to 16mpg which was unheard of at the time for a Class A motorhome, though most owners realized more like 13 to 14 mpg. The Trek with the NPR chassis had a GVWR of 13,200 lbs with a 2,200 lbs payload. This model year came in both a 24-foot model (2400) and a 28-foot model (2830/2810) with all of the amenities known in a Class A such as shower, refrigerator, stove, microwave, sink, water heater. It had an onboard propane tank as well as generator. The electrical system was a 12 volt system with a 70 amp alternator and 1000 watt inverter. The 1992 Safari Trek was again built on the NPR chassis with many of the same features except a 26-foot model was introduced (2600) which came with two twin beds in the rear. Both the 28 foot model (2810/2830) as well as the 26 foot model offered the Electro-Majic bed as an option as both already had rear sleeping quarters. It was during this model year that Safari also introduced the \\"Pathmaker Edition\\" trim line. The Pathmaker Edition came with a patio awning, hydraulic levelers, solar inverter, and air horn. Just as prior model year, options included roof rack and ladder. There was one new option that became near and dear to many Trek owners: The Dame murals painted on the rear of the coach. In keeping with the Safari name, the artistic Dame family was contracted to paint animal and nature themed murals which were one of a kind pieces of art. The 1993/94 Safari Trek though still fabricated on the NPR chassis, had an engine upgrade with the introduction of the inter-cooled 4BD2Tc which boosted power to 135HP. The Electro-Majic Bed which was previously positioned to the front of the coach over the captain chairs, was now moved a few feet aft towards the living quarters. It is believed this move was made so that the television set which also doubled as a rear backup camera monitor could be moved front and center just over head of both driver and passenger. There was the continuation of the Pathmaker Edition and same floor plan configurations as before. The 1994 Safari Trek is essentially the same as the previous model year with the exception of new interior and exterior color schemes, an Onan generator now replaced the Generac, and RVA brand leveling jacks replaced the prior year's HWH leveling jack system. The 1995 Safari Trek saw a complete changeover starting with the termination of the Isuzu chassis engine configuration. There is much speculation as to why the Isuzu chassis was ditched. Some believe that the engine was under-powered while others mentioned the cost vis-a-vis the dollar/yen exchange. Either way, the Trek was now utilizing a GM Chevrolet P30 chassis with a 454 V8 gas engine linked to a GM 4L80E transmission. Also available was a GM 6.5 liter turbo diesel. A very rare and limited number of Chevrolet P72 chassis rear engine diesel pushers were made coupled to an Allison Transmission. The P72 configuration came in coach lengths of 30 and 33 feet. Clearly there was a philosophical change with the Safari Trek as these larger coach lengths and widths were introduced. The new GM chassis were now 6 inches wider than the older 90 inch NPR wheelbase. There were now twice the number of floor plans being offered for a total of eight with more upgrades like dual-pane windows and remote controlled mirrors among other things. With the wider width end caps, widened radiator grill and contoured skirt doors, the Trek now had a more luxurious exterior look and interior feel. The 1996/97 Safari Trek was a continuation of the prior 95 changeover with only minor refinements and exterior/interior color changes. By 1997, SMC was nine years into coach building and the Trek line had well established itself among dealers and consumers as a unique and well built motorhome. Although the longer Treks were now being offered, all of the advertising for the Trek line showed only the smaller 24 and 26 series coaches. The ad copy of this period highlighted the fact that these were smaller, more nimble motorhomes for hard to access campgrounds and narrow roads. SMC was obviously leading with the one feature that put the Trek on the map ‚Äì its smaller footprint. The 1998 Safari Trek saw a number of changes. Gone are all of the longer rear engine, rear bedroom floor plans. Going back to its roots, the Trek line is now trimmed down to two 24 series floor plans and one 28 series floor plan. The Trek is now exclusively using the Chevrolet P-32 chassis with an available 454 Vortec engine or the 6.5 liter GM Detroit Diesel. Both power plants use the Hydromatic 4L80E four speed transmission w/overdrive. Just as every model year has its improvements and refinements, the 98 offered a Datron mobile satellite system and a Delco GPS navigation system. The 1999/2000 Safari Trek kept the same chassis specs, now labeled \\"workhorse\\" and floor plans as the prior year, yet there were some exterior changes made. The riveted aluminum skin that gave the Trek its rugged look now gave way to a very smooth laminated skin though still in aluminum. The new exterior colors and decorative paint designs also took on more of a bold yet fluid, floating ribbon look as if the motorhome was in motion. The Pathmaker Edition option package was still being offered as well as the ever popular Dame murals on the back of the coach. There was now a new \\"Designer\\" interior package with upgraded kitchen counter tops, inlaid carpet, pleated shades, and ultra-leather cab seats. The 2001 Safari Trek was the last year of production before the Monaco Coach purchase. The exterior front cap was redesigned with a sloped nose affectionately called a \\"slopey\\" by its owners. Along with the new front cap, the Trek expounded on the prior year's exterior paint design giving the Trek a sporty in motion look. This model year's sales brochure emphasizes the new custom fabrics and luxury interior amenities available in the \\"Designer\\" package, however, the Trek still leads with it being a small size Class A coach as its greatest asset. The Monaco Coach Years In July 2001, Monaco Coach purchases Safari Motorcoach in mid-model year. The some believe that SMC had expanded too rapidly coupled with poor strategic decisions and acquisitions such as bankrupt Beaver Coach Corporation that soon led to SMC‚Ä≤s own financial deterioration and distraction from their original success with the Trek line.J.D. Gallant, \\"A Retrospective on Safari and Beaver\\" RV Consumer Group Prior to the Monaco purchase, Safari Motorcoach had undergone re-organization and some cost cutting.Magary, Don. \\"RV News Online\\" 1997 The first 2002 Monaco Coach Trek stayed true to the Trek conceptWegzell, Brian. \\"The History of Safari Motorhomes: The Monaco Years\\" t. Apart from exterior color and paint design, the 2002 Model year was essentially a carry-over from the prior 2001 model year using the Workhorse chassis, but with one additional floor plan in the 24 series. The usual improvements and refinements are seen in this new model year but the word \\"small\\" is quietly dropped in favor of \\"smart\\" in brochure copy. A \\"Trek Sport Coach\\" low budget trim line is introduced with a reduced electrical service, single pane windows, vinyl wrapped cabinets, laminate tops, furnishing downgrades, and decal graphics instead of painted graphics. The 2003 Model year is a very different motorhome and serves as the template for subsequent model years. The aerodynamic sloped nose front cap is gone and in its place a more traditional squared front end for improved visibility and a few inches of extra space. The cockpit dashboard has a complete redesign, a splash of many new interior and exterior colors, a plethora of new options and floor plans, and the introduction of a Ford chassis for a 30-foot model. From a marketing and product perspective, the 2003 Trek is a radical departure from SMC‚Ä≤s original roots as the \\"small coach with a big attitude\\" considering that three inches of external width was gained in this model year. The 2003 brochure copy again makes no mention of the Trek as being \\"small\\" as in years past and rightfully re-labels the 24 series to 26 which reflects the coach's actual 26 foot plus length. Beyond the 2003 model year to the final 2008 Trek model year, the same path is taken in expanding options, layouts, and even the introduction of a slide. The Trek has now morphed into a luxurious motorhome with the only thing remaining from its early inception is the Electro-Majic Bed concept now called \\"HappiJac\\" and the Dame murals. Even the exterior aluminum skin which the early Treks were famous for has now been replaced with a gel-coat fiberglass exterior. The original Trek had the appeal of a lower price point for customers wishing to purchase a Class A recreational vehicle of a high quality build. But by 2008 much of that appeal was gone and the Trek was competing with other manufactures who had entered this affordable small Class A market and the growth of the Class B market segment as well. Only 35 production models were made of the 2008 Safari Trek and just two floor plans are show in brochures. With the Financial crisis of 2007-08 downturn in the economy and subsequent economic recession, Monaco Coach filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy in March 2009. Navistar International which by now owned the workhorse chassis upon which many recreational vehicles were being manufactured, purchased the Monaco Coach assets including the Trek brand. In 2013 Navistar sold off Monaco Coach to REV Group, formerly Allied Specialty Vehicles, who now retains the Trek Brand. Revival The REV Group revived the Trek brand and legacy with a trekmotorhome.com website which was more of a low budget landing page. The revived Trek was in production for 2016 attempting to capture some of the lost magic considering that the brand has been shuttered since 2008. To purists, the new Trek was a far cry from its progenitor the Safari Trek, but the folks at the REV Group have put some thought into this new design.Jason, Snow. Kristin, Snow. Snowmads.com No longer called Electro-Majic Bed, a patent pending \\"Bed Lift Feature\\" is in the front of the coach as well as a rear queen bed that also lifts up to create a space they call \\"Trek Room\\". There is also an underneath storage area called \\"Trek Trunk\\" for camping gear. The new Trek came with two 28 foot floor plans and one 30 foot floor plan on a Ford chassis powered by a 6.8 Liter V10 Triton.

Coriaty has dedicated his career to creating buildings that integrate design excellence and place-making with 21st century technologies. His working process has elevated the architects‚Äô role as \\"maker\\" and community leader.  Early life and education Son of Joseph Said Coriaty and Therese Elaine Coriaty, Joseph Coriaty is one of six siblings. He was born in Detroit, Michigan, and spent his childhood in Riverview, Michigan, until 1965, when the Coriaty family moved to Trenton, Michigan. He attended Trenton High School, graduating in 1974. Coriaty received his Bachelor of Science degree in architecture from the University of Detroit in 1978, where he graduated magna cum laude. Coriaty went on to receive his Master of Architecture degree from the University of Southern California in 1980. He has been a registered architect in the State of California since 1983.  Professional career  After Coriaty earned his Master of Architecture degree from the University of Southern California in 1980, he spent the early part of his professional career at John Siebel Associate Architects in Los Angeles, California, John Carl Warnecke & Associates in Los Angeles, and Widom/Wein & Partners in Santa Monica, California. In 1983, Coriaty joined The Landau Partnership in Santa Monica, California, where he worked as the project architect on a number of notable projects, such as Central Park at Toluca Lake in Burbank, California, and The Biltmore Tower at the Los Angeles Biltmore Hotel in downtown Los Angeles. Coriaty joined Frederick Fisher and Partners in 1988, and became a partner in 1995. He is currently the partner-in-charge for Frederick Fisher and Partners' academic, civic, live-work and community-oriented projects. His focus is the design of the firm's large-scale signature academic, library, institutional, and museum projects. Coriaty's strong interest in the process of making is founded in his early years spent in Detroit, a leading car- manufacturing city. His projects share a common ethos ‚Äì one that balances program, beauty, efficiency, and community. Key projects include, but are not limited to: Firestone Library at Princeton University; Seaver Science Center (Library) at the University of Southern California; the Annenberg Center for Information Science and Technology at Caltech in Pasadena, California; Phase III of the Campus Expansion initiative at Otis College of Art and Design in Los Angeles; The Annenberg Community Beach House in Santa Monica; Colby College Museum of Art in Waterville, Maine; Bergamot Station Arts Complex and Redevelopment in Santa Monica; MoMA PS1 in Queens, New York; numerous Houston's Restaurants nationwide; Flint Institute of Arts in Flint, Michigan; and, the Science Education and Research Facility for Crossroads School in Santa Monica.

Coriaty also serves as a board member for the University of Detroit Mercy School of Architecture and the Craft and Folk Art Museum in Los Angeles, California.  Design philosophy  The design of academic and museum spaces constitute a significant portion of Coriaty's portfolio. He is quoted saying that he likes \\"the idea of researchers and visitors alike enjoying their work in a natural setting.\\" Regarding his work on Princeton's Firestone Library, home to over 5,000,000 volumes, he explained, \\"the idea is to embrace the existing building and expand the ethos as a 'laboratory of learning'.\\" Across the country in Pasadena, California, The Walter Annenberg Center for Information Science and Technology, at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, \\"was designed to be more than a classroom‚Äîit was intended to be an experimental learning center,\\" Coriaty said. \\"As a Gold LEED certified structure, its use of natural light minimized electricity, and the idea is to bring nature in, blending space and light. Here, the introspective turns outward.\\" So popular is the building, according to Coriaty, that researchers have a waiting list to work in the building, and classes are more popular than ever. \\"Natural light and air help create a pleasant environment,\\" he said. \\"A pleasant environment helps researchers and students enjoy their work and thus inspire natural collaboration.\\"Earth-Centered Projects Pavilion Links to Natural History\\", concretedecor.net Many of the recent public and institutional projects that Coriaty and his colleagues at Frederick Fisher and Partners have designed, including projects at Caltech as well as the Annenberg Community Beach House at Santa Monica State Beach, share many of the hallmarks of modern architecture: the clean lines, the boxy, glass-wrapped volumes, the disdain for literal historical ornament. They also show a decided interest in Minimalism, paying as much attention to the spaces between buildings as to the buildings themselves.Hawthorne, Christopher (October 5, 2009). \\"Frederick Fisher's radical vision\\". Los Angeles Times Other projects include the Colby College Art Museum in Waterville, Maine, where an enormous artistic bequest necessitated an addition to an existing exhibition space. Despite this prodigious output, Coriaty is quick to single out his colleagues. \\"Architecture is a team sport,\\" he said. \\"I have my partners and many people behind me who help me do what I do.\\" Coriaty traveled to Haiti with members of the Jesuit Refugee Service in an effort to evaluate the damaged school buildings. His knowledge of both architectural design, and structural systems provided a teaching opportunity to educate the local Haitian engineers, and builders in structurally sound design. The experience intrinsically informed him on the importance of balancing form and function in the creation of communities.  Personal life  In 1978, Coriaty moved from Detroit to Santa Monica, California, where he has remained to date. He married Ann Marie Fredal on December 28, 1983, in Detroit, Michigan. Together, they have two children. His personal interests include collecting art, collecting various forms of musical recordings, fine watches, and unique items that are design-oriented.

She was a co-founder of the radical feminist women's paper Fram√•t ('Forward'), and its editor during its entire publication. She wrote under the pseudonym Mark. She was active within the Gothenburg's Women's Association, and a leading figure within the most progressive and radical part of the Swedish and local women's rights movement, and was noted for her involvement in the Sedlighetsdebatten. Life Alma √Ökermark was the daughter of the Gothenburg merchant Anton Wilhelm √Ökermark and Kristina Kristiansson and sister of the painter Isak √Ökermark. Her family was acquainted with the family of the progressive politician and publisher Sven Adolf Hedlund. When she lost her father at the age of sixteen, Hedlund gave her financial support to study music and drawing in Neuch√¢tel in Switzerland, and upon her return to Sweden in 1881, she supporter herself as a teacher in these subjects at the Fruntimmersf√∂reningens flickskola. Through the Hedlund family, she belonged to the progressive circles in Gothenburg. In 1884, the Gothenburg's Women's Association, the first women's organization in Gothenburg, was founded with Hedlund's daughter Mathilda Hedlund as chair. √Ökermark was elected board member the following year. =Fram√•t publication= In 1886, Alma √Ökermark, Hilma Angered- Strandberg and Mathilda Hedlund founded the women's publication Fram√•t ('Forward'), with √Ökermark as editor and the women's association as publisher. Her spouse since 1887, the telegrapher Albert Breinholm, also participated in the magazine. Alma √Ökermark was a radical social liberal who supported social reforms and encouraged the paper to be a center of public debate. She controversially participated in the contemporary Sedlighetsdebatten about sexual double standards between women and men, in which she supported the side that women should be allowed sexual relations outside of marriage, similarly as men were, without being socially ostracized. Her publication of articles with sexual content in the women's paper placed her in confrontation with the moderate women's movement. In 1886, she published the novel Pyrrhussegrar (' Pyrrhic Victories') by Stella Kleve, in which a dying, virtuous woman regretted having refused sexual pleasure because of social convention. The book caused a scandal as it collided with contemporary sexual double standards, and the paper lost its support from the women's association, though the chair, Mathilda Hedlund, did support her personally. Sophie Adlersparre, a central figure of the Swedish women's mowevement, also objected to the Kleve publication as the subject of women's sexual pleasure was much to radical in the eyes even of the contemporary women's movement. With the support of the Hedlund family, Alma √Ökermark managed to continue publishing the paper herself. Fram√•t, however, eventually proved to be too radical and controversial for its time. In 1889, the paper discontinued publication when an organized advertising boycott deprived it of its finances, and Alma √Ökermark lost her work as a teacher. =Later life= She left Gothenborg with her spouse and started a new magazine in Nystad in Finland, Nya Tag ('New Efforts'), which only lasted four months. After the death of her spouse in 1891, she was affected by a depression, and returned to Gothenburg, where she was placed in a mental asylum in 1892. Upon her release in 1896, she left for the United States, where she worked as a pattern instructor for a factory in Chicago. In 1909, she became blind and returned to Sweden, where she was cared for by her relatives.

The rulers of this dynasty used the self-designation \\"Pratihara\\" for their clan, but have been described as \\"Gurjara\\" by their neighbouring kingdoms. Only one particular inscription of a feudatory ruler named Mathanadeva mentions him as a \\"Gurjara-Pratihara\\". According to one school of thought, Gurjara was the name of the territory (see Gurjara-desha) originally ruled by the Pratiharas; gradually, the term came to denote the people of this territory. An opposing theory is that Gurjara was the name of the tribe to which the dynasty belonged, and Pratihara was a clan of this tribe. Among those who believe that the term Gurjara was originally a tribal designation, there are disagreements over whether they were native Indians or a foreign tribe who had migrated to India somewhere around 5th century. A related question is whether the modern Gurjars are representatives of the ancient Gurjara tribe or not.  Earliest mentions of the terms  The earliest mentions of the terms Gurjara, Pratihara and Gurjara-Pratihara in historical records have been analyzed by scholars to determine the origin of the dynasty. = Pratihara = The Gurjara-Pratiharas as well as the Pratiharas of Mandor used the self-designation \\"Pratihara\\". They claimed descent from the legendary hero Lakshmana, who is described as the brother of king Rama in the Sanskrit epic Ramayana. The 837 CE Jodhpur inscription of the Mandor Pratihara ruler Bakuka states that the younger brother of Ramabhadra (Rama) served as a pratihari (door keeper) to his elder brother, because of which his descendants came to be known as Pratihara. The Sagar-Tal (Gwalior) inscription of the Gurjara-Pratihara king Mihira Bhoja says that Saumitri (\\"son of Sumitra\\", that is, Lakshmana) acted as a door-keeper for his elder brother as he defeated the enemies in a battle with Meghanada. K. A. Nilakanta Sastri theorized that the ancestors of the Pratiharas served the Rashtrakutas, and the term \\"Pratihara\\" derives from the title of their office in the Rashtrakuta court. = Gurjara = Nilgund inscription (866) of Amoghavarsha mentions that his father Govinda III subjugated the Gurjaras of Chitrakuta The 6th century Tamil text Manimekalai mentions a temple of \\"Kucharakudihai\\" or \\"Kuchcarakudihai\\" workmanship. Some scholars interpret this word as the Tamil transliteration of \\"Gurjara\\". However, Krishnaswami Aiyangar doubts the accuracy of this interpretation. The earliest undebatable references to the word \\"Gurjara\\" date back to 7th century: * The word Gurjara occurs in Harshacharita, a Sanskrit work by Bana. The relevant worse verse describes the military successes of the king Prabhakaravardhana against various kingdoms. It states that the king was a \\"a lion to the Huna deer, a burning fever to the king of Sindhu, a troubler of the sleep of the Gurjara king, a bilious fever to that scent elephant - the lord of Gandhara, destroyer of the skill of the Latas, an axe to the creeper which is the goddess of fortune of Malava\\". * Chinese traveler Xuanzang describes a kingdom named Kiu-che-lo and its capital Pi-lo-mi-lo. These two words have been identified as Chinese transcriptions of \\"Gurjara\\" and \\"Bhillamala\\" (Bhinmal). This kingdom was located in present-day Rajasthan, surrounded by Mo-la-po (Malwa), U-sha-ye-na (Ujjayini), Po-lu-kie- che-po (Bharukaccha), Fa-la-pi (Vallabhi), and Su-la-ca (Saurashtra). * The 634 CE Aihole inscription of the Chalukya king Pulakeshin II states that the Gurjaras, the Latas, and the Malavas accepted his suzerainty. According to Puri, the Gurjaras referred to in this record were from Bharukaccha (Bharuch). They are mentioned as \\"Samanta\\", and probably owed allegiance to the Kalachuris. Other early epigraphic evidence includes: * The 739 CE Navsari copper-plate inscription records the victory of Chalukya feudatory Avanijanashraya Pulakeshin over Tajika (Arab) army. This inscription states that the Tajika army had plundered the Saindhavas, Kachchhelas (Kutch), Saurashtra, Chavotakas, Mauryas, Gurjaras and other kings. * The Ragholi (Balaghat) copper plates, dated to 8th century on palaeographic grounds, were issued by Jayavardhana II of the obscure Shaila dynasty of central India. It states that his ancestor Prithuvardhana conquered the Gurjara country. * The 808 CE Radhanpur copper-plates of the Rashtrakuta ruler Govinda III describes his subjugation of several kings. It states that on seeing Govinda, the Gurjara vanished - nobody knows where - and even in a dream he (the Gurjara) might not see another battle. Here, \\"Gurjara\\" obviously refers to a particular king. * The 812 CE Baroda copper-plates of the Rastrakuta feudatory Karka mentions two terms - Gurjareshvara-pati and Gurjareshvara. According to B. N. Puri, both of these refer to one king. According to R. C. Majumdar, this king was Nagabhata II of the Gurjara-Pratihara dynasty. D. C. Ganguly argued that these two referred to two different kings: Gurjareshvara-pati (\\"overlord of Gurjareshvara\\") was a king of the imperial Pratihara dynasty, while Gurjareshvara was a subordinate ruler. * The Arab merchant Sulaiman, in his Silsilat Al Tawarikh (851 CE), mentions Jurz (or Juzr) kingdom. Jurz appears to be a transcription of the word Gurjara, and refers to the kingdom of Kannauj. * The 866 CE Sirur and Nilgund inscriptions of the Rashtrakuta king Amoghavarsha state that his father Govinda III subjugated the people of Kerala, Malava and Gauda (or Sauta), together with the Gurjaras who resided in the hill fort of Chitrakuta. * The 867 CE Bharuch grant of Dhruva III mentions that he was attacked by \\"the very powerful army of the Gurjaras\\", who had allied with his younger brother. It also states that a king named Mihira attacked Dhruva, but was defeated. According to Georg B√ºhler and E. Hultzsch, the powerful army here probably refers to that of the Chavada (Chapotaka) king Kshemaraja. However, B. P. Puri believes that the army here refers to that of the Gurjara-Pratihara king Mihira Bhoja. * The 940 CE Deoli inscription of the Rashtrakuta ruler Krishna III states that his ancestor Krishna II (r. c. 878-914 CE) had frightened the Gurjara, and humbled the Gauda, the Anga, the Kalinga, the Ganga and the Magadha. Here \\"Gurjara\\" and others are names of the countries, which signify their kings. * The Karhad plates of Krishna III state that on hearing about Krishna's conquests in the southern region, the hopes about [retaining] Kalanjara (Kalinjar) and Chitrakuta (Chittor) vanished from the heart of the Gurjara. Here, \\"the Gurjara\\" obviously refers to a particular king. This king can only be an Pratihara ruler, as no other dynasty ruled these two forts during this period. * The Badal Pillar inscription of the Pala ruler Narayanapala (9th-10th century CE) states that he \\"scattered\\" the conceit of the Gurjara-natha (\\"Lord of Gurjara\\"). Here, Gurjara refers to a country, and the term Gurjara-natha probably refers to the ruler of Kannauj. * The 954 CE inscription of the Chandela ruler Yashovarman boasts that he subjugated the Gau·∏ças, the Khasas, the Kosalas, the Kashmiris, the Mithilas, the Malavas, the Chedis, the Kurus, and the Gurjaras. The Gurjaras here refer to the Pratihars of Kannauj. * The 10th century Kannada work Pampa-Bharata mentions \\"Gurjara-raja Mahipala\\", who is identified with the Pratihara king Mahipala. * The 1047 CE Goharwa inscription of the Kalachuri king Karna-deva states that his ancestor Lakshmana-raja (c. 950 CE) defeated the kings of Vangala, Pandya, Lata, Gurjara and Kashmira. Gurjara here refers to the ruler of Kannauj. * The 12th century Rajatarangini mentions that the 9th century Kashmiri king Shankara-Varman defeated Alakhana, the king of Gurjara. Some scholars, such as Helmut Humbach and G. Djelani Davary, theorized that \\"Alakhana\\" is the Brahmi transacription of the Bactrian word \\"Alxano\\", and is related to \\"Hara Huna\\" (or Hala Huna) mentioned in ancient Indian texts. However, other scholars identify Alakhana as Ali Khan, a ruler of Gujrat in present-day Pakistan. = Gurjara-Pratihara = The Rajor inscription of a feudatory ruler named Mathanadeva describes him as a Gurjara-Pratihara. According to Puri, he might have been a scion of the Pratihara royal house of Kannauj.  Gurjara: Tribe vs country  The term \\"Gurjara-Pratihara\\" in the Rajor inscription of Mathanadeva has been variously interpreted as \\"Pratihara clan of the Gurjara tribe\\" and \\"Pratihara of the Gurjara country\\". It contains a phrase: \\"all the fields cultivated by the Gurjaras\\". Scholars such as Rama Shankar Tripathi believe that this phrase makes it clear that the term \\"Gurjaras\\" here refers to a tribe or a group of people, rather than a region. Tripathi further argues that in Pampa's description of Mahipala as a Gurjara king can only refer to Mahipala's ethnicity, and not territory, since the Pratiharas ruled a much larger area of which Gurjara country was only a small part. Burjor Avari, a historian of South Asia, believes that the Gurjara and Pratihara were two clans among a larger tribal grouping in Rajasthan and that some elements of that larger federation later became known as Rajputs. Critics of this theory, such as D. C. Ganguly, argue that the term \\"Gurjara\\" is used as a demonym in the phrase \\"cultivated by the Gurjaras\\". In his support, Ganguly cited a verse from Bana's Kadambari, which uses the term \\"Malavi\\" (\\"women of Malva\\") to describe the women of Ujjain, which was located in the Malva region. K. M. Munshi similarly argued that the people residing in the Gurjaradesa (Gurjara country), whenever they migrated to other parts of the country, were known as Gurjaras.K. M. Munshi, The Glory that was Gurjaradƒì≈õa, Vol. III, pp. 5‚Äì6, quoted in V. B. Mishra similarly argues that the expression Gurjara PratihƒÅrƒÅnvayah may very reasonably be taken to mean the Pratihara family of the Gurjara country. Ganguly further points out that several ancient sources clearly mention \\"Gurjara\\" as the name of a country or list it among territories. These sources, according to him, include the Aihole inscription of Pulakeshin II, the Ragholi plates, and the Al Baladhuri's chronicle of Al Junayd's expeditions (723-726 CE). Several other ancient sources mention Gurjara as the name of a country. The Gurjara country is mentioned in Bana's Harshacharita (7th century CE). It is described in detail as a beautiful country in Udyotana Suri's Kuvalayamala (8th century CE, composed in Jalore), whose residents are also referred to as Gurjaras. Xuanzang also names Gurjara (Ku-che-lo) as a country with its capital at Bhinmal (Pi-lo-mo-lo). The fourth book of Panchatantra contains the story of a rathakƒÅra (charioteer) who went to a Gurjara village in the Gurjara country in search of camels. A 795 CE inscription of Gallaka states that Nagabhata I, the founder of the Imperial Pratihara dynasty, conquered the \\"invincible Gurjaras\\". According to historian Shanta Rani Sharma, this makes it unlikely that the Pratiharas were themselves Gurjaras.  Foreign vs indigenous  Among the scholars who believe that \\"Gurjara\\" was the name of an ancient tribe, there is disagreement over the original homeland of this tribe. = Foreign origin theory = A. M. T. Jackson first proposed a foreign origin of the Gurjaras. This view was later endorsed by other historians, including Indian scholars such as D. R. Bhandarkar. Proponents of this theory point out that: * The Gurjara-Pratiharas suddenly emerged as a political power in north India around 6th century CE, shortly after the Huna invasion of that region. They are not mentioned in earlier Indian literature. * The word Gurjar has an ending similar to the word \\"Khazar\\" (the name of an ancient Turkic group of Central Asia and Caucasus). The ancient Gurjaras might have been Khazars who invaded India as part of a Huna confederacy. Jackson argued that the ancient records do not mention them while describing the Hunas, because they might have been a subordinate to the Hunas. A related hypothesis is that the Gurjaras were a distinct Central Asian tribe who arrived in India soon after the Huna invasion, following the decline of the Gupta Empire. * Bana names Hunas and Gurjaras together in a verse, among rivals subjugated by the king Prabhakaravardhana. Another argument in favour of the foreign origin theory is the prevalence of seemingly non-Indo-Aryan names among the Pratiharas of Mandavyapura. This is the earliest known Pratihara dynasty, and according to some scholars such as R. C. Majumdar, the Gurajara-Pratiharas may have branched from this dynasty. Its earliest known member Harichandra was also known as \\"Rohilladhi\\"; another ruler Narabhatta had a second name \\"Pellapelli\\". According to the Agnivansha legend given in the later manuscripts of Prithviraj Raso, the Pratiharas and three other Rajput dynasties originated from a sacrificial fire-pit (agnikunda) at Mount Abu. Some colonial-era historians interpreted this myth to suggest a foreign origin for these dynasties. According to this theory, the foreigners were admitted in the Hindu caste system after performing a fire ritual. However, this legend is not found in the earliest available copies of Prithviraj Raso. The legend was probably invented by the 10th century Paramara court-poet Padmagupta, whose Nava-sahasanka-charita uses it to describe the origin of the Paramaras. The 16th century Rajput bards probably extended this legend to include other dynasties including the Pratiharas, to foster Rajput unity against the Mughal emperor Akbar. = Indigenous origin theory = Critics of the foreign origin theory, such as Baij Nath Puri, argue that: * The word \\"Gujjar\\" or \\"Gurjar\\" is a modern derivative of \\"Gurjara\\" (resulting from schwa-deletion). The ancient Sanskrit term was \\"Gurjara\\", which does not have same ending as \\"Khazar\\". Since -jara and -zar cannot be considered as similar endings, the Khazar origin theory is invalid. * The rise of Gurjaras after Huna invasion does not itself suggest a foreign origin for the Gurjaras. The Mahabharata mentions the Hunas (in Bhishma Parva) as well as several other foreign tribes, but does not mention the Gurjaras or the Khazars. At the same time, the absence of Gurjaras in earlier literature does not prove their foreign origin. They might have been an obscure group, who came to power only after the fall of the Gupta empire. * It seems unlikely that a tribe occupying a position subordinate to the Hunas (as suggested by Jackson) could establish several important kingdoms. For example, Xuanzang's writings suggest that Kiu-che-lo (Gurjara) was a sovereign kingdom ruled by a Kshatriya. It does not name any Huna overlord of this kingdom. * The 899 CE (956 VS) Una inscription states that the Gurjara-Pratihara feudatory Balavarman had \\"freed the earth from the Huna race\\" through his battle victories. This again suggests that the Gurjaras were not considered subordinate to the Hunas. * Bana makes a clear distinction between the Hunas and the Gurjaras, and describes several other kingdoms in the same sentence (such as Malava and Lata). His writings do not prove that these two groups were related in any way. * The theory about the Gurjaras being an independent Central Asian tribe is pure conjecture, as there is no historical evidence of their clash with any Indian power. Moreover, they would have invaded India through the north-west: it is inexplicable why would they choose to settle in the semi-arid area of present-day Rajasthan, rather than the fertile Indo-Gangetic Plain. The supporters of the native origin theory argue that the Gurjaras were well-assimilated in the Indo-Aryan society, unlike the well-known foreign tribes. For example, historical records mention Gurjara Brahmins; such a high varna status was not accorded to foreigners. There is no record of a Brahmin from Huna, Shaka or Yavana groups. But the 1250 CE Tasgaon inscription of the Yadava king Krishna mentions a Gurjara Brahmin from north India. The Pratiharas worshipped the native gods Shiva and Vishnu, and also patronized Jainism. For example, the Sagar-Tal (Gwalior) inscription of Mihira Bhoja begins with a salutation to Vishnu. Moreover, the Pratihara dynasties of Mandor and Kannauj traced their origin to the legendary native hero Lakshmana of the Ikshvaku dynasty. The Gwalior inscription specifically describes the Pratihara king Vatsaraja as a Kshatriya from the Ikshvaku dynasty. The Pratihara court-poet Mahendrapala also supports this claim by describing him as a descendant of Raghu in Viddhasala-Bhanjika and Bala-bharata. The proponents of the foreign origin theory argue that such claims are a characteristic of foreign settlers wanting to establish themselves as the natives. But there are several instances of indigenous dynasties claiming descent from mythological Indian heroes. Scholars who identify \\"Kucharakudihai\\" mentioned in the Manimekalai as \\"Gurjara\\" argue that it is unlikely that a Huna architect was tasked with the construction of a Hindu temple in southern India in 6th century. However, as stated earlier, the accuracy of this transliteration is doubtful.  Original homeland in India  R. C. Majumdar theorized that the place names such as Gujranwala, Gujar Khan, Gujaratra (a historical region in present-day Rajasthan) and Gujarat may indicate a gradual migration of a tribe named Gurjara from the north-west to the south. However, he did not believe that this tribe was necessarily of a foreign origin. Historian Baij Nath Puri, on the other hand, theorized a migration in the opposite direction. According to him, the tribe would have not left the fertile Indo-Gangetic Plain to settle in the semi-arid areas of Rajasthan and Gujarat. Puri believes that their homeland was the Arbuda region (present-day Mount Abu). He presents following arguments in support of hist theory: * The 625 CE (682 VS) Vasantagarh inscription of a king named Varmalata states that his feudatory Vajrabhata Satayashraya protected Arbuda. The inscription names Rajjila as the son of Vajrabhata; the son of the earliest known Pratihara ruler Harichandra was also called Rajjila. Based on this Puri theorizes that the two families shared a common ethnicity. The Vasantgarh inscription also mentions a Pratihara named Bhotaka as one of the contributors to a temple. Puri reads the name as \\"Bhota\\" and pointed out there was a man named \\"Jhota\\" in Harichandra's family. He cites this point to further his theory, arguing that the similar-sounding names indicate same ethnicity. However, J N Asopa points out that \\"Bhotaka\\" is not same as \\"Bhota\\", and the name Rajjila could have been shared by two families of different lineages. * The 11th century Jainad inscription of the Paramara prince Jagaddeva states that the wives of the Gurjara warriors shedded tears in the caves of Arbuda as a result of his military victories. * The Tilaka- Manjari of the 11th century Jain scholar Dhanapala also associates Gurjaras with Arbuda. Based on this, Puri proposes that Gurjaras were an obscure pastoral tribe living around Mount Abu area until sixth century, when they gained political power. The term \\"Gurjaratra\\", from which the word \\"Gujarat\\" is derived, appears as the name of a geographical region starting from 8th century. It appears in the 918 VS Ghatiyala inscription of Kakkuka. The undated Daulatpur grant of Bhoja of Mahodaya, placed in 8th century by L. F. Kielhorn, also mentions a person from Gurjaratra-Mandala. The locations mentioned in these inscriptions have been identified with areas around present-day Jodhpur. Puri theorizes that \\"Gurjaratra\\" was originally used as a generic term for any Gurjara-dominated settlement. Later, it came to denote the present-day Gujarat area. Jinadatta-Suri in his Ganadharasarasataka describes \\"Gujaratta\\" as the Chaulukya kingdom of Durlabharaja, with its capital at Anahilavada. Puri goes on to connect the modern Gurjars with the ancient Gurjaras.  Capital before Kannauj  The Gurjara-Pratiharas established their control over the important city of Kanyakubja (modern Kannauj), and are noted for their involvement in the Tripartite Struggle for its control. Earlier colonial scholars believed that before establishing their control over Kannauj, the Gurjara-Pratiharas ruled Bhinmal (as mentioned in the writings of Xuanzang). However, the discovery of the 871 CE Sanjan copper- plates and other evidence has now led historians to believe that the original Gurjara-Pratihara capital was at Ujjayini (modern Ujjain) in Avanti region. The Sanjan inscription of the Rashtrakuta ruler Amoghavarsha states that his ancestor Dantidurga (r. 735‚Äì756 CE) performed a religious ceremony at Ujjayani. At that time, the king of Gurjara-desha (Gurjara country) acted as his door-keeper (pratihara). The usage of the word pratihara seems to be a word play, suggesting that the Rashtrakuta king subdued the Gurjara-Pratihara king who was ruling Avanti at that time. In addition, the Jain Hariva·πÉ≈õa names one Vatsaraja as the ruler of Avanti as a contemporary of Indrayudha of Kannauj. Historians have identified this king as the Gurjara-Pratihara ruler Vatsaraja.

Pettersen served as the Bishop of the Diocese of Stavanger in Stavanger, Norway from 2009 until his retirement in 2016. Biography Erling Pettersen was born on 21 February 1950 in the city of Bergen in Hordaland county, Norway. He is a 1977 graduate of the MF Norwegian School of Theology in Oslo, Norway. He was ordained as a priest on 1 July 1979. Pettersen was a teacher at the MF Norwegian School of Theology from 1975 to 1976 and again from 1981 to 1984, he was a theological consultant at the Diakonhjemmets school for social workers from 1977 to 1979 and a consultant for the Church of Norway from 1979 to 1985. From 1985 until 1989, he was a missionary priest in Joinville, Brazil. After returning to Norway in 1989, he was the department head of the Institutt for Kristen Oppseding (IKO), a position he held until 1996. He was then the director of the Church of Norway executive council from 1996 to 2006. Pettersen was the main parish priest of Nordstrand Church in Oslo from 2007-2009. Bishop Pettersen was nominated to be Bishop of the Diocese of Tunsberg in 2002 and Bishop of the Diocese of Oslo in 2004, but he ultimately was not chosen. In 2009, after the resignation of Bishop Ernst Baasland in the Diocese of Stavanger, Pettersen was again nominated to be Bishop there. He was voted in second place after Kjetil Aano, but the government chose Pettersen instead. On 19 June 2009, Pettersen was appointed Bishop of the Diocese of Stavanger, and he was consecrated as Bishop on 8 November 2009. There was some public questioning as to why the labour party government chose the second-place finisher for the office of Bishop of Stavanger. The Norwegian Minister of Culture and Church Affairs, Trond Giske, said that Pettersen's support for the ordination of homosexual priests living in same-sex relationships was not the deciding factor even though Pettersen was the only person nominated for Bishop that supported this. After becoming Bishop, 19 priests within the diocese wanted a change because Pettersen was too liberal and not in-line with Biblical teaching. These priests requested an alternate solution so that they did not report to a Bishop that they believed was theologically incorrect. After a lot of discussion, the two sides agreed that the church and bishop's conference were split on the topic and that they would continue to try to find a local solution. Erling Pettersen retired at the end of 2016 and he was replaced by Ivar Braut. Personal life Pettersen has been married to his wife, Turid Barth Pettersen, since 1971. They have 2 daughters and 2 granddaughters.

Garland captured a privateer of greater force than herself, as well as two small prizes. She was sold in March 1803, during the Peace of Amiens. Career Garlands commander was Mr. Francis Banks, masters mate. In April 1796 Garland captured the French privateer Jeune Nantaize near Dominica. Garland was armed with six guns, and had a crew of 18. Jeune Nantaize was armed with four guns, and had a complement of 39 men. The 39 men included a detachment of 13 soldiers from the French garrison at Roseau, and ten volunteer seamen from merchant ships there, all sent by Dominica's governor. Capturing the privateer cost Garland one man killed and two wounded. Banks received a commission as a lieutenant and in August an appointment to command Garland, an appointment he still held in 1799.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 3, \\"Chronological List of the Royal Navy\\", p.537. On 9 April 1800, the tenders and Garland recaptured the schooner Hero. Hero had a crew of seven men and was 136 tons (bm). She was out of Guadeloupe, sailing from Pointe Petre to Saint Bartholomew with a load of cordwood. A week later, Pickle and Garland captured the Dutch schooner Maria. Maria had a crew of 19 men, armed with small arms, and was of 35 tons (bm) burthen. She was from Cura√ßao, sailing from Cura√ßao to Guadeloupe with a cargo of dry goods. On 15 January 1801, while the 20-gun post-ship , 18-gun ship-sloops and , and schooner Garland (tender to Daphne), were at an anchor in the harbour of the Saintes, they observed a convoy of French coasters, escorted by an armed schooner, sailing towards Vieux-Fort, Guadeloupe. At midnight Garland, accompanied by two boats from each of the three ships, under the command of Lieutenants Kenneth Mackenzie of Daphne, and commander of Garland, and Francis Peachey, of Cyane, attempted to capture or destroy the convoy. The vessels, however, except one, succeeded in getting under the guns of Basse-terre. One vessel, which had anchored near Vieux-Fort, they boarded and brought off under a heavy but apparently harmless cannonade.James (1837), Vol. 3, p.133-4. Two days later, in the afternoon, the British observed the French schooner √âclair, of four long 4-pounders, twenty 1¬Ω pounder brass swivels, and 45 men, the escort of the convoy in question, put into Trois-Rivi√®res, and anchor under the protection of one principal battery and two smaller flanking ones. Mackenzie and Peachey volunteered to attempt cutting her out. For this purpose Mackenzie, with 25 seamen and marines, went on board Garland. The next day, 18 January, which was as early as the breeze would permit, Garland ran alongside √âclair and Mackenzie and Peachey, with 30 men, boarded and carried the French schooner in the face of the batteries. Garland had two men killed and three wounded. The French had one man killed and two drowned, and nine men wounded, including the lieutenant de vaissau commanding Eclair. Although √âclair carried only four guns, she was pierced for 12 and was large enough to carry them. She was on her way to Pointe Petre to complete her armament of twelve 6-pounders and 20 brass swivels. The British took her into service and armed her with twelve 12-pounder carronades.

They ruled parts of the present-day Rajasthan between 6th and 9th centuries CE. They first established their capital at Mandavyapura (modern Mandore), and later ruled from Medantaka (modern Merta).  Origins  The origin of the dynasty is described in two inscriptions: the 837 CE Jodhpur inscription of Bauka and the 861 CE Ghantiyala (or Ghatiyala) inscription of Kakkuka. According to the two inscriptions, the family descended from the brother of Ramabhadra. This brother is identified as the legendary hero Lakshmana, the brother of Rama. He is said to have as a door-keeper (\\"pratihara\\") for his elder brother Rama, because of which the family came to be known as Pratihara. The imperial Gurjara-Pratiharas also claimed descent from the legendary hero Lakshmana. The members of the two families also share identical names such as Bhoja, Kakkuka and Nagabhata. Based on these evidences, it appears that the two families were related, although the exact relationship between them is not known. It appears that the Pratiharas of Mandavyapura ultimately became feudatory of the imperial Gurjara-Pratiharas. The earliest known historical members of the family are Harichandra and his second wife Bhadra. Harichandra was a Brahmin, while Bhadra came from a Kshatriya noble family. They had four sons: Bhogabhatta, Kakka, Rajjila and Dadda. These four men captured Mandavyapura and erected a rampart there. It is not known where the family lived before the conquest of Mandavyapura. A 625 CE inscription of a feudatory ruler named Rajilla has been found at Vasantgarh. This Rajilla and his father Vajrabhata Satyashraya were vassals of the Chapotkata ruler Varmalata. B. N. Puri identified this Rajilla as Harichandra's son Rajilla, although the names of their fathers are different according to epigraphic evidence. Puri argued that the members of the two families shared similar names such as Tata, Bapaka and Bauka, and names ending in -bhata (Vajrabhata and Nagabhata). In the later period, the Pratiharas were categorized as one of the Agnivanshi Rajput clans, who were born from a fire-pit. However, the Rajput identity did not exist during their time.  History  Little is known about the reigns of the dynasty's early rulers. Nagabhata, fourth in line from Harichandra, moved his capital from Mandavyapura to Medantaka (modern Merta). The original capital still retained its importance, as Nagabhata's successor Tata is said to have retired there. Nagabhata and his queen Jajjika-devi had two sons: Tata and Bhoja. The Chinese Buddhist traveler Xuanzang described a kingdom named Kiu- che-lo and its capital Pi-lo-mi-lo. These two words have been identified as Chinese transcriptions of \\"Gurjara\\" and \\"Bhillamala\\" (Bhinmal). Historian R. C. Majumdar theorized that the king of Kiu-che-lo was the Mandavyapura Pratihara king Tata. But Baij Nath Puri was critical of this theory, because Xuanzang describes the king as Buddhist and his kingdom as the second largest in western India. The Mandavyapura Pratihara kingdom was a small one. Moreover, Xuanzang does not mention Mandavyapura or Medantaka. According to Puri, the ruler mentioned by Xuanzang was another king named Varmalata. Tata retired to a hermitage in Mandavyapura after handing over the kingdom to his younger brother Bhoja. Next, Tata's son Yashovardhana ascended the throne, possibly after a disputed succession. His descendant Shiluka is said to have \\"fixed a perpetual boundary\\" between the Stravani and Valla countries. He is also said to have \\"knocked down\\" the Bhattika Devaraja of Valla. This appears to be a reference to his victory over the neighbouring rulers. Stravani can be identified with a place in the modern Jaisalmer district, and has been mentioned as \\"Taban\\" by the Arab writers. R. C. Majumdar identified Bhattika Devaraja as the Gurjara-Pratihara king Devaraja, but B. N. Puri disagrees with this theory. Shiluka also excavated a tank, established a new city and commissioned the Siddheshvara Mahadeva temple at a place called Treta. His son Jhota retired after appointing his son Bhiladitya as the king, and proceeded to Bhagirathi River. Bhiladitya also retired after handing over the kingdom to his son Kakka. Kakka is said to have gained fame in the battle of Mudgagiri (modern Munger) against the ruler of Gauda. This probably refers to his participation in the campaign of his overlord Nagabhata II. According to the Jodhpur inscription, Kakka's son Bauka defeated and killed a king of the Mayura dynasty. Kakkuka, a step-brother of Bauka, was the son of Kakka and Durlabhadevi. According to a Ghantiyala inscription, he gained fame in the countries of Travani (Stravani), Valla, Mada, Arya, Gurjaratra, Lata and Parvata. This Another Ghantiyala inscription mentions that he established a market at a place called Rohi·πÉsak≈´pa, which had been deserted for the fear of the Abhiras. Kakkuka is the last known ruler of the dynasty. The dynasty probably ended with him, and the kingdom became a part of the Gurjara- Pratihara territories.  Rulers  Rudolf Hoernl√© assumed a period of 20 years for each generation, and placed the dynasty's founder Harichandra in c. 640 CE. Baij Nath Puri placed Harichandra in c. 600 CE. R. C.

The Jodhpur and Ghantiyala inscriptions of the two step-brothers give same genealogy of the family, except the last two names. Since these two inscriptions were found not far from each other, it appears that Bauka succeeded Kakka (rather than the two dividing Kakka's kingdom).

The station signed on in 1973, found itself heavily in debt and losing money, and was forced to fold in 1975. History =Sign-on= Television Fredericksburg, Inc. was granted a construction permit for station WHFV on channel 69 in November 1972. After construction delays, WHFV obtained an affiliation with NBC and signed on in the evening of October 8, 1973. Local radio man Keith Angstadt, formerly a reporter with WFLS (1350 AM, now WNTX, and 93.3 FM, still WFLS-FM) was the first general manager. WHFV transmitted from a studio and tower on Hudgins Road roughly three miles southwest of downtown Fredericksburg with an ERP of 220.3 kW. (Long after the building and land were sold, businesses in the area still have mailing addresses on TV Drive.) Although Fredericksburg was, then as now, part of the Washington, D.C. television market, it was a separate radio market. The ownership group believed the city was large enough for a locally focused TV station. However, the fact remained that WHFV was trying to compete in a very saturated regional television landscape. First, WHFV not only had to compete with WRC-TV in Washington, but WWBT in Richmond was also available over the air in most of WHFV's coverage area (Fredericksburg is roughly halfway between Richmond and Washington). Second, any reasonably popular syndicated programming was likely to be already picked up by Washington or Richmond stations ‚Äì especially as Washington had two independent stations, WTTG and WDCA ‚Äì leaving WHFV to either duplicate the shows or pick up weaker ones. Third, all other network affiliates in the area were on VHF, with only educational and independent stations occupying UHF channels. Although it had been eight years since the Federal Communications Commission had mandated all-channel tuning, many viewers still did not have a proper antenna for tuning to UHF stations. Many of those who did were not used to tuning to such a high channel number. With this in mind, WHFV ran newspaper advertisements explaining how to tune a UHF channel.Free Lance Star advertisement, November 24, 1973 Issues for WHFV began almost immediately, as it signed on before the local cable franchise received FCC permission to carry it, causing interested viewers to flood the company with complaints. The station carried on for more than a year as a typical small-market network affiliate, carrying NBC, two newscasts a day, a typical slate of syndicated sitcom and drama reruns, and a few local productions.  Sample fall 1973 schedule Advertising support was initially weak in the small coverage area, and financial losses started mounting. As early as April and May 1974, the station began advertising in The Free Lance-Star that stock in Television Fredericksburg, Inc. was available to local residents. One of two non-news productions, the daily Children's World, was canceled and replaced by the then-relatively unknown The Phil Donahue Show at the end of the 1973-74 season. The station's financial losses accelerated during the summer. =Financial trouble and sign-off= By the fall, WHFV was in dire straits. As of Labor Day 1974, it became little more than a pass-through for NBC, as nearly all syndicated programs besides news and Donahue were removed from the schedule. The station filled out its schedule during non-network hours with a daily 4:30 pm movie, an unusually timed 7 pm local newscast, and one low-rent syndicated show in the 7:30 pm slot.  Sample schedule post-Labor Day 1974 Realizing the station was on the brink, Television Fredericksburg began advertising nationally for a buyer and had to resort to short-term loans to continue operations. However, there was nowhere near enough money coming in to service the debt, and the station fell into default. The Free-Lance Star reported that the station had been sued for more than $1 million owed to five local banks, two equipment lessors, and the IRS, in addition to reporting operating losses of $207,000 year-to-date in October 1974. One potential sale to Fairfax County businessman Charles Henry Smith, Jr. fell through in September. Smith expressed his opinion that the operation could turn a profit in several years, and its fatal mistake was going on the air without accounting for this. Television Fredericksburg was severely undercapitalized, and clearly did not have enough cash on hand to survive even a year of losses. Events came to a head on December 16, 1974, as station employees conducted a walkout after going a month without pay. General manager Angstadt locked himself in the building, canceled the newscasts for the day, and performed all other operations solo. The employees returned to work the next day, contingent on being paid December 24, which was itself contingent on an \\"imminent\\" sale. The sale was announced on the 26th, pending FCC approval. The buyer was Texas religious broadcaster Release The World For Christ, Inc., who did not own any stations ‚Äì although owner Chris Panos hosted a syndicated talk show, The Chris Panos Show, on the few stations of Pat Robertson's fledgling Christian Broadcasting Network. Panos pledged to retain the NBC affiliation and keep as much secular programming as possible. Still, six full-time staff members left, including Angstadt, leaving station engineer Ray McInturff to pull double duty as manager. In an attempt to relieve its financial situation, WHFV rented half of its building out and crammed operations into the remaining space. The station's financial trouble brought the attention of the State Corporation Commission, who in March found grounds to block the sale. Television Fredericksburg had been granted an exception from stock-registration requirements under Virginia law, which the state argued should be removed if a controlling stake was to be sold to an out-of-state interest. Television Fredericksburg successfully defended its actions in an April 2 hearing and the sale was allowed to proceed. In an abrupt reversal, on May 28, 1975, WHFV suddenly notified the FCC that it was out of money and would go off the air the next day. The station, having waited as long as it could for FCC approval of the sale, blamed inaction on Release the World's part. The FCC agreed, stating that Release the World had been notified that it failed to submit complete financial information in its application to transfer control. The FCC placed the application on hold and did not take any action while it awaited completed information. (Potential transferees must prove they have enough cash on hand to acquire the station and run it for one year.) The FCC set an original deadline of May 22 to complete the application, after which it would close and eventually be dismissed. Release the World negotiated an extension to May 29. The Free Lance-Star quoted both an anonymous station employee and McInturff as suspecting that the delay showed that Release the World was attempting to back out of the deal. For their part, Release the World said it had sent the information to its lawyer in Washington in time to have the application completed on the 29th, but also stated the group would \\"change [their] thinking\\" on the purchase if the station were to go dark and lay off its staff. Despite this statement, Release the World's lawyer said he never received the information; the application was not completed in time, and the FCC formally dismissed it in July. WHFV signed off for what would be the final time on May 29, 1975 at exactly 4:57:45 pm. The station was so far in debt that it was of no concern that there was no money to pay UPI for the wire service ‚Äì the staff could not even afford more paper for the teleprinter in the first place. =Post-signoff= When exactly the WHFV license was finally canceled is unclear. McInturff indicated that even though he was taking the station dark, he intended to renew the station's license in October 1975 to keep a potential buyer from having to expend the time and money to re- establish it. In July 1975, Television Fredericksburg's lawyer said the company would soon \\"cease to exist\\" as a result of its debts. The channel 69 transmitter was sold in 1976 and moved to Allentown, Pennsylvania to sign-on WFMZ-TV. WHFV was listed as an active callsign when Broadcasting compiled a list of currently licensed UHF stations in February 1979, as well as in the callsign list but not the directory of the 1979 Television Factbook. Both imply that the license was still active, even if the station was not broadcasting. At the time, a television license had a maximum term of 5 years; the license definitely expired by October 1980. In 1986, Rappahannock Television Broadcasting, Inc. received a construction permit to build station WRBV at the former WHFV transmitter site. The permit expired in March 1988 without being built amid accusations of fraud among the partners. Although Fredericksburg grew into a full-fledged radio market of its own, no further attempt has been made to start a locally focused television station. The channel 69 allocation would never again be occupied in Fredericksburg; the nearest station to have broadcast on channel 69 was WQAW-LP Lake Shore, Maryland, a suburb of Baltimore, before it was removed from television use in the 2009 digital television transition. The WHFV callsign is now in use on an unrelated FM station in Elkton, Virginia. Keith Angstadt moved to Mutual. Steve Handelsman, a longtime political reporter with NBC News, worked as a reporter at WHFV before moving on to WLWT Cincinnati as the station shut down. Programming and coverage WHFV was on the air from 7:00 am until the end of network programming, signing on for Today and on most days signing off at 2:00 am after The Tomorrow Show. Initial programming outside of NBC and local news for the 1973-74 season were reruns of older sitcoms and dramas (I Love Lucy, The Andy Griffith Show, Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C., Have Gun Will Travel, The Danny Thomas Show), movies on the weekends, and church services and other religious programming on Sunday mornings. The station had two other local productions: a public affairs program titled Close-Up, which aired Sunday evenings at 10:30 pm, and the daily Children's World at 9 am. Local newscasts aired on the weekdays during Today station breaks (7:25 and 8:25 am), and every day at 6 and 11 pm. For the 1974-75 season, the non-network schedule was gutted to cut costs. Programming included reruns of the 1950s-era Hank Thompson Show, Jim Ed Brown's The Country Place and a syndicated version of The Jimmy Dean Show, all in the 7:30 pm slot. After Release the World entered into an agreement to buy the station, The Chris Panos Show was added to this rotation. The remaining time after NBC went off the air at 4:30 pm and before the NBC Nightly News at 6:30 pm was filled by a daily movie, with the local evening newscast moving to 7 pm. Close-Up was kept, while Children's World was replaced with The Phil Donahue Show. The station claimed grade B coverage in a 35-mile radius: north to Centreville, west to Orange, south to Ashland and east into rural St. Mary's County, Maryland. It also gained carriage on the few cable systems within its coverage area: Fredericksburg, Orange, Culpeper, Dale City, Woodbridge, and La Plata, Maryland. At least in Fredericksburg proper, the cable system carried all three NBC outlets but substituted WHFV during network programming.

History Ellen was born at \\"Talarno\\", Kapunda, South Australia to solicitor William Hoare Benham (27 November 1833 ‚Äì ), who arrived in South Australia aboard The Gipsy in August 1853, and his second wife Amie Benham n√©e Huggins. Her father worked as a shearer for three years and drove bullocks before settling down as a lawyer's clerk and studying law. :W. H. Benham was born in Hayes, near Uxbridge, Middlesex. At age 12 he embarked on a four-year apprenticeship to John Boyce, a chemist of Chertsey, Surrey, but in 1849 his parents moved to Brook Green, Hammersmith, London, and he was obliged to break his contract, and he found employment as office boy for a lawyer in Essex Street, Strand, London. His health broke down and he was advised to seek the warmer climate of South Australia, and emigrated aboard Gipsy which arrived in August 1853. Fellow passengers included Lionel Pelham, who was drowned in the SS Gothenburg disaster, A. J. Tolley, and Mr. Holden. With most of the able-bodied men at the Victorian goldfields seeking their fortune, there was little call for a lawyer's clerk, but he found work on Edward Stirling's sheep and cattle station at Lake Alexandrina. He found later work at Langhorne's Creek with Carter Potts, then experienced wheat farming in Strathalbyn, which entailed trialling Ridley's first header. By 1856 his parents and siblings had migrated to the colony, and he joined them in Adelaide, finding employment in the legal office of Matthew Smith, then with Hanson & Hicks. Then an opportunity arose for Benham to advance in the legal profession by taking his articles with James Huggins in Kapunda. In 1860 he married Elizabeth Wood, daughter of Rev. William Wood of Penwortham. They had a son Frank in 1861. On 21 June 1864, just a few days before his final examinations, his wife died. On 26 June 1864 he was admitted a practitioner of the Supreme Court of South Australia, and was taken into partnership with Huggins. In April 1867 he married again, to Amie Huggins, eldest daughter of his partner; they had around twelve children, of whom eight survived to adulthood. Ellen was educated privately, then at the Advanced School for Girls before taking the science course at the Adelaide University, graduating BSc with honours in 1892.Helen Jones, 'Benham, Ellen Ida (1871‚Äì1917)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, , published first in hardcopy 1979, accessed online 24 July 2016. She taught science at the Christ Church Anglican school in Kapunda for a short time before taking a study tour of England and Europe. She took an assistant position at Dryburgh School, then taught at Tormore House School for a little over twelve years. During this time she travelled to England, where she earned her Diploma of Education at Oxford University. After the death of Professor Tate she taught botany at Adelaide University and was appointed lecturer pro tem while awaiting the arrival of Professor Osborn Thus she was, under similar circumstances to Ada Mary Lambert at Melbourne University, the first woman appointed to an academic post at the university. In December 1912 she purchased Walford School, Fisher Street, Malvern, from Lydia Adamson, its founder in 1893. She reformed its teaching methods and course content, notably introducing science to the curriculum. In 1917 she sold the school to Mabel Jewell Baker, who then led the school for almost 40 years. Recognition In 1922 the Ellen Benham Scholarship was established at Walford in recognition of her contribution to the development of the school. The Benham Wing, which incorporated science classrooms, in what became the Walford Church of England Girls' Grammar School, was also named for her. She was a co-founder and longtime supporter of Adelaide University's Women's Students' Society, and its president for several years. Benham Street, in the Canberra suburb of Chisholm, is named in her honour.

It is a dramatic narrative adapted from journalist Stevie Cameron's 2010 book of the same name, examining the years leading to serial killer Robert Pickton's arrest and the court proceedings before his conviction. Plot Nikki Taylor (Elle-Maija Tailfeathers), a resident of Vancouver's Downtown Eastside, struggles to get out of the cycle of addiction and sex work to get back to her son. She notices the disappearance of an alarming number of women as she fights to get off the streets. She teams up with social worker Elaine (Sarah Strange) and police officer Sinead McLeod (Sara Canning) to investigate. They face a slow-moving police department until the media takes notice and it becomes a national story. Cast * Elle-M√°ij√° Tailfeathers as Nikki Taylor * Sarah Strange as Elaine * Sara Canning as Sinead McLeod * Patrick Gallagher * Kevin McNulty * Tantoo Cardinal  Production  Shot on location in Vancouver, British Columbia, in the Downtown Eastside.  Awards  The film won the awards for Best Television Movie, Best Screenwriting in a Television Movie, and Best Casting in a Television Movie at the 2016 Leo Awards. It was also nominated for Best Direction, Best Cinematography, Best Picture Editing, Best Musical Score, Best Make-Up, Best Supporting Performance - Female (Sara Canning), and Best Lead Performance - Female (Elle-M√°ij√° Tailfeathers). At the 5th Canadian Screen Awards in 2017, Tailfeathers won the award for Best Actress in a Television Film or Miniseries.  Reception  The narrative has been noted for its refusal to put the serial killer as the main character. Francois Marchand of The Vancouver Sun notes: \\"A more sensational retelling of the story would be about Pickton, but On The Farm is clearly not about the character portrayed briefly by actor Ben Cotton, who doesn‚Äôt have a single line of dialogue and is simply credited as 'The Farmer.'‚Äù The Globe and Mail television critic John Doyle states: \\"The Pickton character barely appears and the attention is, rightly, on the addicts and sex workers and the handful of cops who understood from the start that the matter of missing women deserved serious scrutiny.\\"  References   External links  Canadian films Films directed by Rachel Talalay Films shot in Vancouver Canadian television films 2016 television films ","title":"Unclaimed (2016 film)"},{"id":"51149395","text":"The statue of Taras Shevchenko is an outdoor sculpture by Valentyn Znoba, installed in Sm√≠chov, Prague, in the Czech Republic.

The two seasons are inspired by the novel series of the same name by Douglas Adams. The series is co-produced and distributed by BBC America and Netflix, along with AMC Studios, Ideate Media and IDW Entertainment. Filming primarily took place in Vancouver, British Columbia. The series features an ensemble cast, including Samuel Barnett as the \\"holistic detective\\" Dirk Gently, and Elijah Wood as his reluctant sidekick Todd. Other main cast members include Hannah Marks as Todd's sister Amanda, Jade Eshete as security officer Farah Black, Fiona Dourif as \\"holistic assassin\\" Bart, and Mpho Koaho as computer technician Ken. The first season is set in Seattle, Washington and the second season is set in the fictional town of Bergsberg, Montana. The eight-episode first season premiered on BBC America on October 22, 2016, to positive reviews, before concluding on December 10, 2016. All episodes were made available on Netflix (outside of the United States) on December 11, 2016. On November 21, 2016, BBC America renewed the series for a 10-episode second season which premiered on 14 October 2017. Following the broadcast of the second season finale, the show was cancelled. Premise The show is based around the eccentric Dirk Gently (Samuel Barnett) who claims to be a \\"holistic detective\\", investigating obscure cases based on the inter-connectivity of all things. During the first season he befriends Todd Brotzman (Elijah Wood) and Farah Black (Jade Eshete) who help him with his cases. Dirk's past is linked with \\"Project Blackwing\\", a secret CIA project to evaluate subjects with strange abilities. Dirk is not only followed by agents of Blackwing trying to recapture him but also by Bart Curlish (Fiona Dourif), another Blackwing subject who considers herself a \\"holistic assassin\\" and believes she is destined to kill Dirk. Cast * Samuel Barnett as Dirk Gently, an eccentric \\"holistic\\" detective, who understands everything in the universe to be interconnected.

Episodes =Season 1 (2016)= Bellboy Todd Brotzman, while tasked to check in on the hotel's penthouse suite, is disturbed when he sees himself talking to an unknown person when the elevator briefly stops on one of the hotel's floors. When he reaches the penthouse, he is shocked to discover that its guest, the wealthy Patrick Spring, and other unknown men have been brutally murdered, seemingly by a large animal based on the damage to the room. Todd becomes a person of interest in the investigation when he is later met by Dirk Gently, who forcefully injects himself into Todd's life. Dirk claims to be a \\"holistic detective\\" and that he was hired by Patrick to investigate his murder, and drags Todd into being his assistant in his investigation. Along the way, they are joined by Farah Black, Patrick's bodyguard who had been taken captive during Patrick's murder while she was trying to find Patrick's missing daughter, Lydia. Their investigation revolves around a machine created by 19th century inventor Zachariah Webb. Zachariah's invention enables the souls of two bodies to be swapped, and can allow one to travel through time. However, one of Zachariah's tests resulted in the machine falling forward in time to the 1960s, where it was found by a group of hippies. Initially using the soul- swapping to create trans-extensional experiences with zoo animals, the hippies start using the machine to transfer souls with influential people, gaining wealth and power, and becoming the cult \\"Men of the Machine\\". In the present, this cult is led by Gordon Rimmer. In the days prior to Patrick's murder, Lydia Spring had figured out a connection between her family and Gordon and accosted him about it, but instead he abducted her, swapped her soul with that of a corgi, and planned to use Lydia to coerce Patrick into giving up his \\"other machine\\". Through clues left by Patrick, who is in fact Zachariah Webb travelling in time, Dirk and Todd find the machine and escape from Gordon by travelling back in time to just before Patrick's murder. They encounter a figure in clockwork armor, who is revealed to be another version of Patrick, from 2001, who traveled forward in time to recover his initial machine from the Men of the Machine; they, however, go separate ways, hoping to stop Gordon. At the penthouse the Patrick in the clockwork armor disrupts the meeting: a cat, whose soul had been transferred with that of a shark, gets loose, and the shark's soul psycho-kinetically attacks everyone present, killing the present Patrick and some of Gordon's cult. As Dirk, Todd, and the armored Patrick flee the hotel, Todd recognizes the conversation he had seen himself in previously. Later they encounter an earlier version of Dirk, and the present version provides his earlier self with cryptic clues to direct him to meet with Todd and solve the case. Now aware that he will be killed in the future and of Lydia's plight, Patrick returns to 2001 to bury the machine for Dirk and Todd to find, and set up events so that he can assure Dirk will take Patrick's case and save Lydia. With help of Farah, Todd's sister Amanda (who suffers from \\"pararibulitis\\", a nerve disorder that creates painful hallucinations), Bart Curlish (a \\"holistic assassin\\" who believes she must kill Dirk) and her companion Ken, and the \\"Rowdy 3\\" (a band of four violent punks that feed off psychic energy), Dirk and Todd are able to stop Gordon and the Men of the Machine from using Zachariah's device further, leading to the cult members‚Äô deaths, while returning Lydia to her body before they return the repaired machine to Zachariah Webb in the 19th century. Dirk sets up his \\"Holistic Detective Agency\\" with Todd and Farah. As the last episode closes, government agents working for the secret Blackwing project, of which Dirk and several others were once a part, converge on and capture Dirk, Bart, and Ken, and are closing in on Amanda and the Rowdy 3. Meanwhile, Todd, who had faked having pararibulitis for several years as to be sympathetic for Amanda, suddenly finds himself having a real incident of pararibulitis. =Season 2 (2017)= Todd and Farah, on the run from the FBI, end up in the rural town of Bergsberg, Montana while searching for Dirk, who has been captured by Project Blackwing, a secret government organization studying people with strange talents. Blackwing has also captured three of the Rowdy 3, with Amanda and Vogel searching for them, and Ken, whom Bart is along searching for. Dirk meets some of the other subjects in Blackwing, including \\"Project Moloch\\", a man that has been in a coma for years, and Mona Wilder, a \\"holistic actress\\" with shapeshifting abilities. Mona tells Dirk to \\"find the boy\\" and teleports him to Bergsberg, where he reunites with his friends. Sgt. Friedkin, currently in charge of Blackwing, gets Ken's help to review old files related to Blackwing and Bergsberg, but Ken uses the opportunity to usurp power from the dimwitted Friedkin. Dirk, Todd, and Farah befriend Sheriff Sherlock Hobbs and Deputy Tina Tevetino, and learn that the town had an unusual electrical surge in 1967, which caused the disappearance of Hector and Marina Cardenas, along with their son Arnold. Dirk suspects this is the boy he must find. They meet Panto Trost, a man who claims to have come from the world of Wendimoor, a fantasy land, and who is seeking a man named \\"Dirk Gently\\" who will find the boy to help fulfill a prophecy to save the warring families of Wendimoor from an evil Mage and his newly found apprentice. While they investigate, the Mage has arrived in Bergsberg and his apprentice's wand has fallen into the hands of depressed soccer mom Suzie Boreton, who learns how to use it to better herself and kill those that she despises. Dirk and his allies search the Cardenas' home to find that it contains a fantastical pocket dimension and a portal to Wendimoor itself. Eventually their investigation leads them to find Arnold, who had changed his identity after the 1967 event. Arnold is prepared to tell them what happened before he is killed by the power-hungry Suzie. While Farah, Sherlock, and Tina try to deal with the Mage, Dirk and Todd travel to Wendimoor to try to understand how it is connected to Bergsberg. Amanda and Vogel also travel there, when Amanda's budding psychic powers are triggered when they are cornered by Mr. Priest, a bounty hunter working for Blackwing. While there, Amanda meets the forest witch Wakti Wapnasi, who had given Panto the prophecy, and is trained by Wakti to locate and bring the other Rowdy 3 to Wendimoor, helping to fend off forces loyal to the Mage. Dirk concludes that Wendimoor was created by Moloch, back in 1967. Prior, the Cardenas had found Moloch as an infant on a boat that mysteriously appeared in Bergsberg in the 1950s, but soon learned that he had the ability to alter reality while dreaming. That caused them to be put under investigation by Blackwing's predecessor. The stress of this led to Marina considering selling the farm to the Kellum corporation, but Hector refused, and in a struggle Marina accidentally stabbed and killed Hector in front of Arnold and the boy. The boy fainted, his dreams leading to Hector and Marina's disappearance. Shortly thereafter, Arnold called Blackwing to have them pick up Moloch. Frightened, the boy fell into a coma, and created the electrical surge, which Dirk likens to the Big Bang that created Wendimoor from the boy's dreams. Now, with the Mage and Suzie threatening both worlds, Moloch unconsciously seeded Dirk's name to Wakti and Mona, leading to the present events. Meanwhile, Suzie has entered Wendimoor, usurped the Mage's troops, and sent them to attack Dirk and his allies. The Rowdy 3, along with Panto and Bart, help to slow them down. Farah, Sherlock, and Tina end up killing the Mage in Bergsberg. Dirk returns to Blackwing with Amanda's and Todd's help to stop the Mage's forces, now loyal to Suzie, from killing Moloch. Amanda and Todd briefly find themselves in a space between the realities of Bergsberg and Wendimoor that explains Dirk's \\"holistic\\" nature and how everything is connected. Dirk and Mona rescue Moloch and bring him back to Wendimoor, where he returns to being a young boy. He removes Suzie's powers and imprisons her, and starts to restore Wendimoor to how he had crafted it, including resurrecting those killed by the Mage's forces. After thanking them for their help, the boy returns Dirk, Todd, Amanda, Mona and the Rowdy 3 to Bergsberg. Amanda decides to stay with the Rowdy 3 to help watch for other people targeted by Blackwing, while Dirk, Todd, and Farah set up a permanent home for Dirk's detective agency, unaware Mona has followed them. Bart asked to be returned to Blackwing, but is dismayed to learn Ken has taken over as the facility's manager and plans to leave her a prisoner to study. Friedkin ends up in the space between realities and comes to an epiphany. Reception The first season received a favourable response from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, it has a 71% approval rating based on 28 reviews, with an average rating of 6.54/10. The site's consensus reads \\"Odd and ambitious, Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency sometimes overdoses on pure weirdness but offers absurdist rewards to those who stick with it.\\" On Metacritic, the first season has a score of 62 out of 100 based on 14 reviews, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". The second season was also received favorably. On Rotten Tomatoes, it has a 100% approval rating based on 11 reviews, with an average rating of 7.33/10. However, its viewership was down from the first season, averaging less than 250,000 views per episode compared to 287,000 per episode from Season 1. It is believed these numbers, which were slightly lower than fellow BBC America program Orphan Black, led the choice for the network to cancel the show. Following the broadcast of the second season finale, BBC America announced the show's cancellation. The decision to cancel the series sparked outrage among fans of the show, and a petition was started to renew the series. As of March 2018, the petition has received over 100,000 signatures.

S bovis is mostly transmitted by Bulinus freshwater snail species. It is one of nine haematobium group species and exists in the same geographical areas as Schistosoma haematobium, with which it can hybridise. S. bovis-S. haematobium hybrids can infect humans, and have been reported in West African countries, namely Senegal, and during a 2013 outbreak on Corsica. Taxonomy Schistosoma bovis is a digenetic, two-host blood fluke in cattle. It is one of nine Schistosoma species that share a similar lifecycle in the mammals they infect, called the haematobium group of schistosomes. Hybrids between S. bovis and the human schistosome, Schistosoma haematobium were first described in 2009 in Northern Senegalese children, and to a lesser degree hybrids between S. bovis and cattle schistosome S. curassoni found only in cattle. S. bovis / S. haematobium hybrids were also found during the 2013 outbreak traced to the Cavu river on Corsica. As a hybrid increases the host range of the parent species, they affect transmission, and as is known from other schistosome hybrid pairings, morbidity and drug susceptibility, so they are epidemiologically important.  Life cycle  Schistosoma life cycle Schistosoma bovis infects two hosts, namely ruminants (cattle, goats, sheep, horses, camels and pigs) and freshwater snails (Bulinus sp. and Planorbarius sp.). In water, its free swimming infective larval cercariae can burrow into the skin of its definite host, the ruminant, upon contact. The cercariae enter the host's blood stream, and travel to the liver to mature into adult flukes. Adult flukes can coat themselves with host antigen thus avoiding detection by the host immune system. After a period of about three weeks the young flukes migrate to the mesenteric veins of the gut to copulate. The female fluke lays eggs, which migrate into the lumen of the gut and leave the host upon defecation. In fresh water, the eggs hatch, forming free swimming miracidia. Miracidia penetrate into the intermediate host, the freshwater snails of the Bulinus spp., (e.g. B. globosus, B. forskalii, B. nyassanus and B. truncatus), except in Spain, Portugal and Marocco, where Planorbarius metidjensis can transmit. Inside the snail, the miracidium sheds its epithelium, and develops into a mother sporocyst. After two weeks the mother begins forming daughter sporocysts. One month -or more with cooler ambient temperatures- after a miracidium has penetrated into the snail, hundreds to thousands of cercariae of the same sex begin to be released through special areas of the sporocyst wall. The cercariae cycle from the top of the water to the bottom in search of a host. They can enter the host epithelium within minutes.  Geographical distribution  S. bovis infects snails in Africa north of the equator, Europe (Sardinia, Corsica, Spain) and the Middle East as far as Iraq. S. bovis - S. haematobium hybrids have been reported in Senegal, and as of 2013 in Corsica.  Diagnosis  =Laboratory= The diagnosis of schistosomiasis can be made by microscopically examining the feces for the egg. The S. bovis egg is terminally spiked, spindle shaped, and the largest in size compared to other Schistosoma eggs at 202 Œºm length and 72Œºm width. In chronic infections, or if eggs are difficult to find, an intradermal injection of Schistosome antigen to form a wheal can determine infection. Alternatively diagnosis can be made by complement fixation tests, commercial serological tests have included ELISA and an indirect immunofluorescence test, hampered by a low sensitivity ranging from 21% to 71%. Exposure to any Schistosoma eggs or cercariae can cause false positive serological test results for individual Schistosoma species, unless highly specific antigens are used. Various polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays to differentiate S.bovis from other Schisosomes in urine and naturally infected snails for surveillance purposes have been described since 2010.  Pathology  The ova are initially deposited in the muscularis propria of the gut which leads to ulceration of the overlaying tissue. Infections are characterized by pronounced acute inflammation, blood and reactive epithelial changes. Granulomas and multinucleated giant cells may be seen. = Immunopathology = The immune system responds to eggs in liver causing hypersensitivity; an immune response is necessary to prevent damage to hepatocytes. The hosts' antibodies bind to the tegument of the Schistosome but not for long since the tegument is shed every few hours. The schistosome can also take on host proteins. Schistomiasis can be divided into three phases; Within the haematobium group S. bovis and S. curassoni appear to be closely related : (1) the migratory phase lasting from penetration to maturity,(2) the acute phase which occurs when the schistosomes begin producing eggs, and (3) the chronic phase which occurs mainly in endemic areas.  Treatment  Historically, antimonials and trichlorphon were tested against visceral Schistosome infection in cattle. Antimony affects phosphofructokinase activity in Schistosoma, hycanthone intercalates Schistosoma DNA and the organophosphorus metabolite dichlorvos inhibits acetylcholinesterase, \\"but progressively less so in S. bovis\\". Since the 1980s the drug of choice is praziquantel, a quinolone derivative which disrupts membranes, leading to calcium influx. It clears eggs from stool, and affects adult but not immature worms. Damaged and dying flukes can be trapped in the liver and cause fatal portal vein thrombosis.  Disease prevention  The main cause of schistosomiasis is the dumping of human and animal waste into water supplies. Hygienic disposal of waste would be sufficient to eliminate the disease.

Establishment The Australian National Travel Association was formed in 1929 at the onset of the Great Depression by Sir Charles Lloyd Jones (1878‚Äì1958), merchant and patron of the arts (who became director of its board of management). Most states had already, or soon had, tourist bureaux though their budgets were insufficient. Prime Minister Stanley Bruce announced the formation of the national organisation on Wednesday 1 May 1929, allocating ¬£100,000, obtained mostly from tourist industries for Australian overseas publicity. Operation Australia lithograph in colour, c.1929, designed by Percy Trompf, printed by Troedel & Cooper Ltd., Melbourne The organisation was put under the control of a committee of representatives of the principal contributing bodies, comprising Harold W. Clapp, chairman of Victorian Railway Commissioners, D. I. Dowell, representing British and foreign shipping interests, C. W. Wilson, proprietor of Scott's Hotel, Melbourne, on behalf of Australian hotels, and C. Lloyd Jones, of David Jones Ltd., Sydney, for Australia's general business interests. In addition representatives were appointed to England and America, to 'make vigorous contact with travel- selling agencies through the English-speaking world'.Waitt, G. (1997). Selling paradise and adventure: Representations of landscape in the tourist advertising. Australian Geographical Studies, 35(1), 47-60. H. C. Fenton became representative in Great Britain in Grand Buildings, Trafalgar Square, London, and the association's representative in U.S.A. and Canada A.H. O'Connor worked from an office in the Adam Grant Building at 114 Sansome Street, San Francisco. In 1956 the first managing director of the Australian National Travel Association, Charles Holmes, appointed West Australian award- winning journalist Basil Atkinson to reopen the first ANTA office abroad since the war, in San Francisco, to promote Australia as a tourist destination for Americans. After a successful advertising campaign, Atkinson was recalled to be general manager of ANTA, reorganising operations and winning increased government financial support which supported the opening of an office in London, followed by offices in Wellington and New York. In order to allay perceptions of competition between the states and the national organisation Atkinson arranged for all states and two government agencies to have representation on the ANTA board. Marketing From its inception the Association marketed creatively, first commissioning posters featuring striking images and simple slogans from Australia's leading poster designers (some now iconic, like Trompf's Bondi Beach) including Percy Trompf, James NorthfieldNorthfield, James & Hetherington, Michelle, 1959- & National Library of Australia & Northfield, James, 1887‚Äì1973 (2006).

Subsequently, in 1934, the ANTA board, under acting chairman Charles Lloyd Jones, established a monthly travel magazine Walkabout which continued publication until 1974. It attracted widespread advertising support from tourism businesses and promoted aspects of Australia of which even its own citizens would have been unaware. It was assertively Australian in its ethos but took cues from other popular magazines of the period, such as the United States' National Geographic Magazine, and LIFE. From August 1946, Walkabout also doubled as the official journal of the newly formed Australian Geographical Society (AGS), founded with a ¬£5,000 grant from ANTA, its banner subscript reading 'Journal of the Australian Geographical Society'. This role is now filled by Australian Geographic magazine. Later it became ‚ÄòAustralia's Way of Life Magazine‚Äô when supported by the Australian National Publicity Association and later the Australian Tourist Commission.

Meetings Industry Association of Australia, Neutral Bay, Australia, p.10 On its recommendations federal parliament passed the Australian Tourist Commission Act, resulting in the Association's major function, tourism marketing, being incorporated into a statutory authority, the Australian Tourist Commission (ATC) which provided for the promotional functions of ANTA to be taken over from July 1967, with Atkinson being appointed its first chief executive. ANTA maintained its representation of tourism stakeholders and became the Australian Tourism Industry Association in 1985, prompted by its growing industry potential, and then was renamed the Tourism Council Australia in 1995.Craik, Jennifer (2001) Tourism, Culture and National Identity.

The Soberanes Fire was the result of an illegal campfire in Garrapata State Park. The fire burned along the Big Sur coast in the Los Padres National Forest, Ventana Wilderness, and adjacent private and public land in Monterey County, California. At the fire's peak, over 5,000 personnel were assigned to the blaze. At the time that it was extinguished, the Soberanes fire ranked 18th on the list of the top 20 largest California wildfires, in terms of acreage burned.

Sobranes fire burnout operations on Chews Ridge, on September 17, 2016 The fire was first reported by hikers in Garrapata State Park at 8:48 a.m. on Friday July 22, 2016, and was later determined to be the result of an unattended illegal campfire.Precious time was lost between the time the hikers spotted the fire and were able to hike to a location where they could connect to a cell phone repeater to report it. By Saturday morning, the fire had grown to , and forced the evacuation of about 300 homes in the community along Palo Colorado Canyon. By the morning of Sunday, July 24, the fire had grown to over , with 5% of the fire perimeter contained. Officials said that Toro Park would be closed so that firefighters could use the area as a base camp. Evacuation warnings were also issued for all of Carmel Highlands. On Tuesday July 26, acting California governor Tom Torlakson declared a state of emergency in Monterey County over the fire. By Saturday July 30, the fire had spread south and east into the Los Padres National Forest. Almost a month later, on August 26, the fire had grown to over and was only 60% contained. The majority of the fire by then was within the Los Padres National Forest and the Ventana Wilderness, and unified command of the fire suppression work was transferred from the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection to the United States Forest Service's Alaska Interagency Incident Management Team. By September 18, the fire had increased in size to . Containment was still only at 61%, and 1,921 firefighters were at work. Some evacuation orders on the northern perimeter had been lifted, and crews were working on burn-out operations to establish a containment line on the northeast side of the fire, near Chews Ridge. Heavy smoke resulted from the burnouts. the costs to fight the fire exceeded $200 million, the most expensive fire in United States history at the time. On October 9, the fire had burned and was 99% contained. Incident management personnel expected to attain full containment by October 15. Fire personnel had been reduced to 704 workers, with many engaged in fire suppression repair efforts. On October 28, three months after the wildfire had started, fire management personnel reported that the fire was 100% contained, and that remaining smoldering hotspots would be put out by rains expected shortly afterward. By that time, restoration crews had completed suppression repair work on of the fire line.  Damage, deaths and injuries  madrone in the United States was burned and possibly killed by the 2016 Soberanes Fire. On Tuesday July 26, at 11:00 PM, Robert Oliver Reagan, an on-call bulldozer operator contracted by Czirban Concrete Construction to CalFire, was killed when his bulldozer rolled over, pinning him, while he was maneuvering around a fire truck on a steep slope in the Palo Colorado Canyon area.Dozer Rollover Fatality Bulldozer operator Robert Reagan, 35, of Fresno County, died July 26, 2016, when his bulldozer overturned while he was building a fire line near Palo Colorado Canyon in Big Sur. The fire destroyed 57 homes and 11 outbuildings in the Garrapata Canyon and Palo Colorado Canyon areas during the first three weeks. Robert Baird, supervisor of the Los Padres National Forest, estimated that firefighters saved US$6.8 billion worth of real estate. The fire burned and possibly killed the largest Pacific madrone tree in the United States, within the Joshua Creek Canyon Ecological Reserve. The tree was tall and more than in circumference. The madrone was listed on the American Forests National Big Tree list, a register of the biggest trees by species in the United States. The California Department Of Parks And Recreation announced on September 28, 2016 that Garrapata State Park east of Highway 1, where the fire started, would remain closed through the winter. =Legal actions= In March 2017, Reagan's family filed a wrongful death suit against the state of California for her husband's death while fighting the fire. They later dropped the suit due to a law that gives the state immunity from wrongful death lawsuits. In April 2017, Czirban Concrete Construction, the contractor by whom Reagan was employed, was fined $20,000 for failing to report the fatality, failing to require seat belts on the equipment, failing to warn employees of the applicable hazards, and other offenses. Ian Czirban, the head of the company, was also charged by Monterey County prosecutors with six felonies for tax evasion, insurance fraud, and a misdemeanor charge for failing to maintain workers' compensation insurance. Czirban disputed the fines and charges, saying that he was not Reagan's employer and did not own the equipment at issue. He entered a plea of \\"not guilty\\" on May 11, 2017. In October 2019, Czirban was found was guilty of two counts of willfully failing to file a payroll tax return, a count of not having a workers' compensation insurance policy, and a count of filing a false document. He was convicted and sentenced to 300 days of home confinement and three years of felony probation for violating state labor laws. Another company, Industrial Defense Development, was fined $6,000 for injuries that another firefighter sustained when the water truck he was driving rolled over an embankment. Cause On August 2, 2016, officials announced that their investigation found that the fire had been caused by an unattended illegal campfire. While no suspect was identified, Monterey County District Attorney Dean Flippo said that, if an arrest were made, the culprit could be charged with negligence and manslaughter.

Along with the Spanish, Spanish Filipinos, native Filipinos and Japanese mercenaries participated in the invasion of Cambodia.http://www.samuelhawley.com/imjinarticle3.html  Background  Each country that participated in the war possessed different motives for their invasion of Cambodia. Specifically, the Thai interference and the Spanish expedition was a result of a power struggle between rival factions in Cambodia's government. In addition, both Spanish and Portuguese took part in the invasion of Cambodia because King Philip II ruled both Spain and Portugal.  Path to war  In February 1593, Thai ruler Naresuen attacked Cambodia in order to fight the Burmese. Later on, in May 1593, 100,000 Thai (Siamese) soldiers invaded Cambodia. As a result of the Thai's invasion, Longvek was conquered in July 1594. In 1593, the Spanish expedition led by Gregorio Vargas Machuca and Blas Ruiz de Hern√°n Gonz√°les invaded Cambodia from the city of Manila in the Spanish East Indies. Although the Spanish invasion of Cambodia (supported by Luis P√©rez Dasmari√±as) failed, Ruiz and Diogo Veloso succeeded in establishing king Barom Reachea II in May 1597. The king granted the Spaniards territorial rights over two provinces on the east and west sides of the Mekong River. Veloso later secured permission and financing to build a garrison. In 1599, he commanded four ships from Manila but two of these were ship-wrecked due to a storm. After Spain's brutal attack on Malay residences, private individuals of Muslim Malays, Chams, Cambodians retaliated by slaughtering the Spanish and Portuguese, including Diogo Veloso.

The leagues club sits beside the Sharks home ground, Endeavour Field and is located on Captain Cook Drive at Woolooware. Development plans Sharkies Leagues Club Proposals to develop the land assets of the Leagues Club which owns the stadium and land around Endeavour Field stumbled for many years prior to arrival of renowned businessman Damian Irvine. In partnership with his head of finance Craig Douglas the plans finally became more tangible, as details of a residential and shopping centre were released. In August 2012, the club received final approval for their plans solving a 40-year-old problem of financial instability. In an opportunistic political grab amongst the publicity surrounding the supplement scandal implicating coach Shane Flanagan, Irvine and Douglas were replaced after their resignations in early 2013 by a local junior rugby league club ticket. The ticket used the shamed coaches' popularity to garner public support over the two men who are credited with saving the clubs life in 2009-2013. Former basketball player Damian Keogh was used as a high-profile chairman however he lacked knowledge of history with the club. Since the departure of Irvine and Douglas the Club has floundered from one disaster to another with player sackings, suspect refinancing deals, governance issues, poor media relations and perception, and finishing last in the league for the first time in decades. Only the arrival of respected CEO Lyall Gordon has seen 2016 be a watershed year off and on-field for the Sharks.

Of the 200 passengers on board, 17 died and 28 were injured. This was the first major loss of lives on New Zealand railways; the newspaper The Press noted that each of the previous fatal railway accidents had resulted in no greater loss of life than that resulting from an overturned motor car. The Ongarue disaster remains the third worst railway accident in New Zealand's history. Almost exactly twenty years later on 4 June 1943, its death toll was surpassed in the Hyde railway disaster, which claimed 21 lives. Ten years after that, 151 died in the Tangiwai disaster. ≈ångarue Rail Accident, 6 July 1923 Accident On the evening of 5 July 1923, the Auckland to Wellington express was timetabled to leave Auckland at 7.10 pm but was held for more than four hours. One report said that authorities were forced to await news on rain swollen areas of the Waikato through which the express would pass, and the decision to go was not made until 10 pm. It also said that the earlier northbound express on the same route had been delayed due to landslips, and cleaning of the carriages had been necessary before it could return to Wellington as the ill-fated southbound express. The express eventually left Auckland at 11.25 pm with about 200 passengers aboard. As the locomotive rounded a curve just south of Ongarue at about 5.52 am the next morning, it struck a landslip caused by heavy rain. Embedded in the landslip was a boulder of about 1.5 metres diameter. This boulder derailed the locomotive and threw it onto the bank of a cutting, causing the first and second carriages to telescope completely. The third carriage was partly telescoped onto the second. The postal van, between the locomotive and first carriage, was almost undamaged and none of its three postal workers was injured. About four chains (88 yards, 80 metres) of track were torn up. Mr A. Stewart, the driver, said that he had shut off steam at the top of a rise and the train was proceeding downhill under its own weight. As it rounded a sharp bend he got a glimpse of the slip and the engine was ploughing through it before he could apply brakes. He thought the train could have cleared the slip safely but for the \\"huge boulder\\", which was carried along for two or three chains (44‚Äì66 yards, 40‚Äì60 metres) before the engine derailed. Stewart suffered a badly scalded arm and bruises on the head and thigh. Campbell, the fireman aged 27, was badly scalded and suffered cuts to his nose and an ear. The train's guard, H.P. Hobson, stated in an interview that the train cleared Ongarue and was then running about 25 to 30 miles per hour (42‚Äì50 km/h). About a minute and a half later, he said, the train came to a sudden stop. Hobson sent the sleeping-car attendant back along the track to Ongarue to raise the alarm. A relief train from Taumarunui arrived within two hours after the disaster carrying rail workers and equipment. Hobson confirmed that the presence of the boulder in the slip was primarily responsible for the telescoping of the second-class carriages in which all the casualties occurred. He described in detail the circumstances of the wreckage and injured, and said that the first of the injured were sent to Taumarunui within two or three hours after the disaster, with the remainder arriving there shortly after noon. Casualties Eleven passengers were killed outright, and another two died either en route to Taumarunui Hospital or shortly after arrival there. Four others subsequently died. Inquiry The three-man inquiry released its report on 30 August 1923. The inquiry heard evidence from 51 witnesses and found that there were good grounds for concluding that the slip was falling as the train approached, and that boulders obstructing the track were the cause of the disaster. No railway official was found guilty of neglect.

He is best known for skipping bail, faking his own death, and convincing law enforcement officials he died in the 1978 Jonestown Massacre. Living under the fake identity Ricky Allen Wetta, Balisok was arrested in 1989 for attempted murder in King County, Washington. Once the fingerprinting process was complete, law enforcement officials learned Ricky Allen Wetta was indeed Jerry Balisok. His capture made national headlines across the United States, and drew national criticism towards the FBI investigators for not properly identifying the remains believed to be Balisok's. Balisok's crimes, his life as a fugitive, and later apprehension were featured in the book, Wicked North Alabama, by Jacquelyn Procter Reeves. Early life Balisok was born in Biloxi, Mississippi to Coleman Balisok, a school teacher, and Marjorie Balisok, a hospital nurse. As a toddler, the Balisok family moved to Huntsville, Alabama, and Jerry graduated from Huntsville High School in 1973. Coleman died from a heart attack when Jerry was 13, leaving Marjorie to raise him as a single, working mother. As a standout high school wrestler, Balisok caught the attention of Buddy Fuller, promoter of Southeastern Championship Wrestling which ran events in the Huntsville area. Pro wrestling career After training in Florida, Balisok returned to Huntsville to begin his professional wrestling career in 1974. Prior to his first match, Balisok was informed that being paid as a pro wrestler might affect his amateur status. After watching a training session, Balisok drew interest from University of Tampa wrestling coaches, but was informed he would be ineligible for NCAA competition if he pursued a pro career. At the time, wrestling promoters advertised pro wrestling events as competition and not entertainment. It wasn't until 1989 when Vince McMahon announced outcomes were predetermined, and pro wrestling shouldn't be held to the same standards by state governments as other sports leagues. Fuller convinced Balisok to use the Mr. X gimmick, a character that had been utilized by numerous pro wrestling territories for decades. All wrestlers who had utilized the Mr. X character wore a red or white mask, and Fuller believed if Balisok hid his face, he couldn't be identified and would maintain his college eligibility. After performing as Mr. X for a year, Balisok saved up enough money to attend the University of Tampa and join the wrestling team as a walk-on in hopes of earning a scholarship. However, Balisok was informed by the coaching staff they learned of his pro wrestling career and he was not eligible to join the team. Balisok was never told how the coaching staff found out, but he believed Buddy Fuller tipped them off so he could continue his pro wrestling career. Balisok left the Southeastern Championship Wrestling promotion soon after. From 1975 to 1977, Balisok continued performing as Mr. X for Georgia Championship Wrestling (GCW) and Championship Wrestling from Florida. He had notable feuds with Dusty Rhodes, Mr. Wrestling II, and The Masked Superstar. Despite his 6'1\\", 300 lb. frame, Balisok was usually on the losing end of these feuds, because the Mr. X character had traditionally been used as jobber to other wrestlers. Despite his desire to change gimmicks, promoters were eager to keep Balisok in the Mr. X role to raise the profile of other performers on the roster by defeating a wrestler of Balisok's size. In January 1977, Balisok was involved in a motorcycle accident. He had numerous injuries, including a fractured hip. Doctors had to place a pin into Balisok's hip, putting his professional wrestling career in jeopardy. Check forgery and fugitive life Instead of using his money to attend the University of Tampa, Balisok bought a motorcycle store in Huntsville, Alabama in 1974. While recovering from his motorcycle accident, Balisok began focusing more on his business. However, the FBI soon began investigating Balisok for check forgery. In 1977, Balisok was indicted on 13 counts of check forgery for writing bad checks over international lines. The prosecution accused Balisok of paying for motorcycle parts in Caribbean countries with fraudulent checks, written while he was performing on overseas wrestling tours . Under federal law, Balisok faced 10 years in prison for each count due to the dollar amount each check was written for. Prior to his indictment, Balisok was dating Deborah Kindred, a Huntsville native who had recently separated from her husband. Fearing a conviction and long prison sentence, Balisok informed Kindred he intended to skip bail and live life as a fugitive. Kindred stated her desire to join him, and the couple fled Huntsville with Kindred's young son. Prior to leaving Huntsville, Kindred finalized her divorce from her estranged husband. Balisok and Kindred then broke into the home of Kindred's second cousin, Ricky Allen Wetta, and stole his birth certificate, driver's license, and social security card. Balisok used these pieces of identification to assume Wetta's identity, and married Kindred under the Ricky Wetta name. Later in 1977, prior to the first day of his trial, Balisok and his new family fled to Miami, Florida before settling in Puerto Rico. Balisok was hired by King Wrestling promoter, Campe√≥n Escalera, as a performer. Escalera was unaware that Balisok was wanted by the American FBI. Later that year, Balisok and his family relocated to The Bahamas to perform at National Wrestling Alliance events in Nassau. However, Balisok was informed by the Bahamian government his visa was expiring and would not be renewed. In late 1978, Balisok and his family relocated to Seattle, Washington after he obtained a job at Boeing by falsifying college transcripts stating he graduated from the University of Cambridge in England. During the interview process, Balisok demonstrated detailed knowledge of aerospace engineering but was fired in 1979 after company officials discovered he forged his transcripts. After settling in Seattle, Balisok and Deborah had three children. Their son John Taylor appeared on the reality television series Too Fat for 15: Fighting Back. FBI search After Balisok didn't show up to his trial in 1978, a warrant was issued for his arrest. FBI investigators tracked his whereabouts from Alabama to Florida and through the Caribbean but agents never managed to capture him. By mid-1978, agents had no leads for Balisok's location. In December 1978, the cover of Life Magazine showed the dead bodies of those who committed mass suicide as part of the Jonestown massacre. Balisok's mother, Marjorie, told the FBI that three of the bodies in the Life Magazine photo were Balisok, his wife Deborah, and her son. The FBI quickly dismissed Marjorie's belief, but she asked to identify the bodies once the remains were flown back to the United States from Guyana. The FBI informed her that all of the bodies in Jonestown were decomposed by the time law enforcement officials arrived, and they were all buried in Oakland, California, thus making identification of the bodies impossible. Upset at the FBI after hearing this news, Marjorie had a tombstone placed for Balisok at Maple Hill Cemetery in Huntsville, Alabama with the inscription, \\"Damn the state dept.\\" Marjorie died in May 1983, and the FBI called off the manhunt for Jerry later that year. Due to the lack of success in apprehending Balisok, the Alabama State Attorney General's office dropped the check forgery charges in 1984 because prosecutors were satisfied he was dead. With no charges against him, Balisok could have ended his life as a fugitive due to the statute of limitations expiring. However, Balisok was unaware the charges were dropped and he continued to live as Ricky Allen Wetta. Additional crimes & imprisonment In the 1980s, Balisok earned wealth from commercial real estate development, primarily on hotels. In 1988, Balisok purchased a hotel property in Wenatchee, Washington. The property caught fire later that year, and investigators quickly ruled it an arson. Balisok was later indicted for the crime after prosecutors accused him of setting fire to the building to collect the insurance monies. For an unknown reason, when law enforcement officials fingerprinted Ricky Allen Wetta during the booking process, his real identity of Jerry Balisok did not come up in their database. In September 1989, Balisok was arrested for the attempted murder of Emmett Thompson, Jr., a friend of Balisok's stepson. Prosecutors accused Balisok of shooting Thompson to cover up the arson crime. After being granted legal immunity, Thompson confessed to committing arson at the Wenatchee hotel after being paid by Balisok to do so, and stated Balisok tried to kill him to prevent prosecutors in the arson case from discovering how the crime was carried out. After his arrest, King County law enforcement discovered Ricky Allen Wetta was actually Jerry Bibb Balisok after being fingerprinted. Balisok's capture made national headlines around the United States. In 1990, Balisok was found guilty of attempted murder and received a 20-year prison sentence. In 1992, Balisok was found not guilty of the arson charge in U.S. Federal Court. Balisok's attempted murder conviction was overturned in 1993 after the Washington Court of Appeals ruled the prosecution lacked evidence for a motive after Balisok was found not guilty on the arson charge, and jury misconduct took place in the original case. In 1994, Balisok's conviction was reinstated by the Washington Supreme Court. U.S. Supreme Court Defeat Balisok was released from prison in 2003 after serving 13.5 years. While incarcerated, Balisok worked as a legal advocate for himself and other inmates, specializing in appellate law. In 1997, Balisok lost a decision before the Supreme Court of the United States (Edwards v. Balisok 520 U.S. 641, 1997). Balisok was caught cheating on a test while in prison, and claimed the prison violated his due process rights when they punished him with a loss of good time (early release) credits. On appeal to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, Balisok successfully argued that he should be able to bring his Due Process claim for money damages in Federal Court under the Civil Rights Act, before asking the state court to grant back those early release credits in a Habeas Corpus action. After the Ninth Circuit's ruling, Washington Assistant Attorney General Talis Abolins successfully petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court for review and, in 1997, the Supreme Court rejected Balisok's claims and clarified that prisoners who claim an unlawful loss of early release credits must first seek a return of those credits in state court before bringing a federal civil rights claim for money damages. (Gary Edwards and Tana Wood v. Jerry B. Balisok 520 U.S 641117, 1997). Balisok's civil rights claim was dismissed for failure to exhaust the state court habeas corpus remedies. This precedent helped define the jurisdictional line between claims that fall under the Civil Rights Act, and those that are subject to habeas corpus, which provides state courts with the right to first address a claim that will impact the duration of a prisoner's criminal sentence. Later life and death Upon his release from prison, Balisok moved to Seattle, Washington. In 2006, Balisok legally changed his name to Harrison Rains Hanover. He began working as funds manager for JPierce Investments, and in 2009, he was implicated in a scheme to defraud First Security Bank of Washington, though formal charges against Hanover were never filed. Later in 2009, Hanover moved to Nicaragua to work for the investment company The Five Day Bullet Trade Program. Hanover later married a native Nicaraguan woman named Scarleth. In 2012, Hanover was arrested in Rivas, Nicaragua for sexual offenses. He was sentenced to 24 years in prison and ordered to serve time in the Penitentiary System of Granada. On April 18, 2013, Hanover was rushed to the hospital complaining of chest pains, and died of a heart attack brought on by the heat within the prison. Hanover's heat-related death caused a commotion among prisoners and their families, who asked for an investigation into the ill-health effects caused by extreme temperatures.

Life Froidebise was born in the rural Condroz village of Ohey, province of Namur, the son of a well-off retail pharmacist. After completing his secondary education, he began studying the organ, first at the Namur Conservatory with and then with Paul de Maleingreau at the Brussels Conservatory, where he also studied composition with Raymond Moulaert and fugue with L√©on Jongen. He took the first prize for organ in 1939, and in 1941 won the Agniez Prize for composition (; ). He subsequently studied composition with Paul Gilson and Jean Absil, before moving to Paris to further his organ studies with Charles Tournemire . In 1942 he became organist at the church of Saint-Jacques in Li√®ge, where later he performed and was choirmaster at the Grand S√©minaire and taught harmony at the Conservatory, where he was appointed professor in 1947 . In the meantime, he won the Belgian second Prix de Rome in 1943 for his cantata La navigation d‚ÄôUlysse . As a teacher, his notable students include and Henri Pousseur. Froidebise died in Li√®ge on 28 October 1962 . Compositional style Froidebise's earliest organ compositions show the influence of C√©sar Franck, but his enthusiasm soon turned to Igor Stravinsky for his model. His Trois po√®mes japonais for voice and orchestra, Op. 1, No. 1 (1942), while exhibiting traits of his teacher Absil, in its overall feeling recalls Stravinsky's Three Japanese Lyrics, and the Russian master's presence is even clearer in the Cinq comptines for voice and eleven instruments, Op. 1, No. 2 (1947), which was performed at the 1950 ISCM Festival . His discovery of the music of Anton Webern led to a decisive turn to serialism beginning in 1948, with the cantata Amerc≈ìur‚Äîa rather severe work setting Li√®ge place names in an economical twelve-tone technique . From this point onward, Froidebise was a confirmed dodecaphonist and maintained regular contact with Olivier Messiaen, Ren√© Leibowitz, and Pierre Boulez in Paris . His finest work, St√®le pour Sei Shonagon (1958), for soprano and four instrumental groups, added aleatory elements to a warmer use of twelve-tone technique than that found in Amerc≈ìur, combined with a supple rhythmic treatment .

Saziari was noted in his lifetime for his healing gifts and was known for remaining celibate and childless though married. Saziari's beatification received confirmation from Pope John Paul II on 9 December 1980 after his 'cultus' (or popular following and devotion) was approved. His feast is set each 21 April - the date of his death - and he is the patron of both Franciscan tertiaries and farmers. Life Giovanni Saziari was born in Cagli in 1327 to peasants. Saziari married but remained celibate and childless. He owned a small piece of land and tilled the land as a farmer and was known for his simple and austere life. Saziari became renowned as a healer and there were numerous cases of people with fever who came to him during a time of plague that were healed; an official in Imola in 1374 after Saziari's death that recorded these purported miracles. Saziari was described as being shorter than the average. He died on 21 April 1371 and his remains were interred in a wooden urn at the altar of Madonna delle Neve in the church of San Francesco in Cagli. His remains were moved in 1642 after the previous altar he was interred in was demolished so taken to Madonna delle Neve. Beatification He received beatification - on 9 December 1980 - from Pope John Paul II after the confirmation of his 'cultus' (or popular devotion and following). He remains the patron of farmers and Franciscan tertiaries and his annual liturgical feast is fixed for Saziari. An old document from 1441 had confirmed longstanding and popular veneration.

The first to take the title was Khan Mardu Khan in the 16th century. After him, his clan, the Mardukhel (literally the Clan of Mardu), ruled the valley for more than 400 years . They belong to the Miranzai sub-tribe of the larger Bangash tribe. History The history of the family before Mardu Khan is not well documented. However several sources claim that Bangash migrants settled in the valley in the 1500s, came into conflict with the local tribes and a series of battles were fought. One of the opposing tribes was the Orakzai. An incident is noted that while the tribes were engaged in fierce battle, a youth arrived at the scene and declared \\"Dai\\" (meaning \\"It is\\") three times and went on to say \\"Sam the Bangasho, Ghra the Orakzo\\" which translates from Pushto as \\"It is, it is, it is, The valley plains for the Bangash and the hills for the Orakzai\\". An alliance is also documented between the Bangash and the Khattak in driving the rival tribes from the valley. However, the Khattaks were also driven out some time later. As today, although the Orakzai still inhabit some parts of Hangu district and are even allied to the Bangash, the Khattaks are not present and are instead settled in neighbouring Karak. Battle with Darveza After Mardu Khan was declared Khan, during his reign, Hangu was attacked by a detachment of troops led by Darveza Niazi. Being heavily out numbered, Mardu Khan retreated to the Miranzai stronghold of Kasha, a strategic location in Hangu's Samana mountain range. The Mishti and Rabiakhel Orakzais at Kasha were close allies of the Khan. During his brief stay at Kasha, Mardu Khan had gathered a huge number of troops. Along with his Miranzai kinsmen, his newly reinforced army could have possibly included tribals of the surrounding area. A counterattack was launched and resulted in a decisive victory for Mardu Khan. Darveza himself was one of the casualties and lost his life, while Mardu Khan returned victorious and established rule once again. This rule would go on for centuries. After Mardu Khan, the title passed to his son, Khan Muhammad Khan, and a dynasty came into being Title Although the name 'Khan' is synonymous with Pashtun people, in the tribal system only the tribal chief was given the title of Khan, meaning 'King' in Turkic languages. His family members were individually referred to as Khan as well whereas the whole family would be named 'Khankhel' (Clan of the khan). Nowadays nearly all Pashtuns, and some other groups of people use the term indifferently. Role in political affairs The Khan had the role of King, Commander in Chief of the Army, Jirga Leader etc. all in one. Absolute authority was exercised by the Chiefs. Their control gradually extended up until a point in time. During the reign of Ghulam Muhammad Khan, the eighth Khan of Hangu, his control extended from the borders of Waziristan in the south to Mattani in the Peshawar district in the northeast. British Raj After the British came to the North-west Frontier for occupation, they faced strong resistance from the local Pashtun population. A number of expeditions were sent to every area that did not pay revenue or dismissed British rule. Hangu valley was no exception. However, when Hangu's borders were continually attacked by Wazir tribes in adjacent Waziristan, especially the city of Thall, Hangu had to cease fire after the first Miranzai expedition. However, with the Waziristan tribes still continuing their raids on British garrisons and Hangu villages, the Khan sought revenge for betrayal and an alliance with the British was made to put an end to the rebels once and for all. The second Miranzai expedition was led by General Chamberlain, Muhammad Amin Khan, who was a cousin of the Khan of the time 'Ghulam Haider Khan' and Captain Coke. Amin Khan knew how to deal with the Wazirs and therefore was present in the British contingent. The expedition was a success and succeeded in crushing the raiders, forcing them to submit and pay revenue. Some Turi tribe elements, also involved in the raids, were also dealt with. Turis were allied to the Bangash of Thall but later turned their backs against them. Ghulam Haider Khan died when his eldest son, Khan Bahadur Allahyar Khan, was still very young. This led to the decision of making Ghulam Haider Khan's brother, Muzaffar Khan, the chief. The title of Khan was confirmed to Muzaffar Khan despite Captain Coke's insistence on making another man, loyal to him, the chief. On this Captain Coke resigned. Political and international affairs The Khans of Hangu were on friendly terms with the Mughal and later Durrani empires. They were fierce rivals of the Brakazais, who succeeded the Durranis. A number of letters, usually of national importance, were exchanged between the Mughal rulers and Hangu chiefs. Letters from emperors Shah Jahan, Jahangir and Aurangzeb are still in possession of the family. The Khans and their Armies had differing relations with the British government. At first they were completely against them and fought valiantly to oppose occupation. But after the Waziristan and Turi fronts continued to disrupt any progress, they decided to join hands with the British and deal with them by force. Just as seen in international politics today, all alliances, treaties and agreements etc. are signed based on national interests. Hangu, assessing the situation, and seeking vengeance, sided with the party that contributed in protecting their interests.

A modern retelling of William Shakespeare's The Tempest, the novel was commissioned by Random House as part of its Hogarth Shakespeare series. The novel centres on theatre director Felix who loses his job with Makeshiweg Theatre, and is exiled from his position in society, following his betrayal by a trusted colleague. Having suffered in isolation, Felix is granted the position of teaching in a prison literacy program in the Fletcher County Correctional Institute. Thus begins his plot of revenge against those who wronged him. The novel had varying reception among critics and audiences. A witty, dark and imaginative adaptation of Shakepeare's play, Hag-seed manages to convincingly create a vengeful Duke Prospero from the slightly ridiculous, and certainly more sympathetic, director Felix. Dealing with themes of loss, revenge, a life of imprisonment and the concept of closure, Atwood uses Felix's lessons on The Tempest to the actor-inmates to demonstrate the parallels between her text and the original play. The story culminates with a \\"fantastic climax of dark calamity\\" in a metaphorical and literal storm. Atwood's Hag-Seed can be considered an example of what Graham Wolfe calls \\"theatre-fiction\\": \\"referring to novels and stories that engage in concrete and sustained ways with theatre as artistic practice and industry\\".Wolfe, Graham. Theatre-Fiction in Britain from Henry James to Doris Lessing: Writing in the Wings. Routledge, 2019. 2.  Plot summary  Hag-Seed follows the life of Felix, once experimental Artistic Director of the Makeshiweg theatre festival, now an exiled man who speaks to his daughter's ghost. Felix's fall from the theatrical elite is brought about by the betrayal of his right-hand man, Tony. Using Felix's vulnerability after the death of his wife Nadia post- childbirth and the death of his beloved daughter Miranda, Tony used his influence and connections to oust Felix from his position and then have the board instate himself in the role. Worst, for Felix, is the cancellation of his production of The Tempest. A play which he had thrown himself into in order to cope with the loss of his own Miranda. After an unceremonious firing and being escorted to his car, Felix decides that he must entirely retreat from the theatrical world he's known. Felix plunges into a form of self- inflicted exile, aiming to escape the press he imagines will humiliate him and those who betrayed him. He moves into a ramshackle cottage off the grid and relies on his unofficial, cash-in-hand landlords, Maude and Bert, for his power access. Nine years into his seclusion, Felix has spent his time imagining a life shared with his dead daughter and keeping track of the two men who betrayed him; Tony and the minister of heritage Sal O'Nally. Following an advertisement for a teaching position at the literacy program in the Fletcher County Correctional Institute, Felix applies for the position using the name 'Mr. Duke'. Hired by Estelle, who recognises him as Felix, Felix convinces her to give him a chance in the position to teach through performing Shakespeare - and to keep his true identity a secret. A professor at Guelph University, Estelle will not be involved in the day-to-day running of the program. However, as his work proves a success, she secures further funding and eventually organises a visit to a prison performance by two newly appointed government ministers, Tony and Sal. Four years into the prison program, Felix now has his opportunity for revenge. Choosing to finally stage The Tempest he casts Anne-Marie, his original actress for the role of Miranda and begins readying the actors within the prison as part of his revenge scheme. The play culminates in a drug fueled chaotic performance of the play, Sal and Tony are frightened and punished.

Later that year, it was announced that Margaret Atwood's adaptation of The Tempest would join Jeanette Winterson's Winter's Tale adaptation and Anne Tyler's Taming of the Shrew adaptation as part of the project. The Hogarth Shakespeare series, Hag-Seed included, was intended to launch in 2016 to coincide with the four- hundredth anniversary of Shakespeare's death.  Explanation of the novel's title  Felix asks his students to make a list of \\"curse words\\" used in the Tempest. On the list is \\"hag-seed\\". Felix bans all swearing from rehearsals save for the curse words from the list. Awards and nominations Hag-Seed was on the long list for the 2017 Baileys Women's Prize for Fiction.

Kolodko to address the contemporary civilizational challenges and economic system transformations. It is based on the imperative for a harmonious triply sustainable social and economic growth. New pragmatism, by creating a new, multidisciplinary epistemological perspective for analyzing economic phenomena and by providing new, enriched cognitive and analytic methods and tools stands for abandoning the economic orthodoxy in favor of what works, and what may be a useful basis for solving actual social and economic problems. Cognitive and methodological eclecticism is inherent in this approach. Characteristics New pragmatism as a theoretical concept fits squarely in the sequence of views of philosophers and economists who believed the meaning and purpose of economics as a science is to find the rules governing the functioning of a good economy in specific temporal and spatial conditions (Adam Smith, Karl Marx, John M. Keynes, John K. Galbraith, Douglass C. North, Edmund S. Phelps, Joseph E. Stiglitz), rather than to look for universal timeless economic laws. New pragmatism searches for a reasonable compromise between an economic policy of national states and the policy run at a regional and international level. The economics of the future emerging from new pragmatism creates and equips politicians with tools to prevent ‚ÄúYet Grander Crises‚Äù, as Kolodko calls them. What should be an important rule governing the economy of the future is moderation, or consciously adapting the size of human, material and financial flows to the requirement to maintain a long-term dynamic balance. In descriptive terms, new pragmatism explains the historic development process, emphasizing not only the significance of respective causative factors but also their coincidence. In normative terms, new pragmatism indicates the goals of economic activity, which should involve: * economically sustainable growth, i.e. sustainable with respect to goods and capital markets as well as investments, finance and labor; * socially sustainable growth, i.e. sustainable with respect to socially acceptable, fair division of income, which favors capital accumulation, and to appropriate participation of basic population groups in public services and access to public goods; * environmentally and spatially sustainable growth, i.e. sustainable with respect to maintaining appropriate relations between human economic activity and nature, both on a current and long-term basis; In new pragmatism, economics is seen as a science that is: # descriptive, explanatory and evaluative alike ‚Äì a description is a point of departure and imminently leads to a normative (prescriptive), that is evaluative perspective; # contextual ‚Äì analyses and syntheses are not conducted in isolation from reality, in ‚Äúpure‚Äù economic models but, instead, with reference to specific dynamic and variable complex circumstances, determinants, constraints and possibilities; # complex ‚Äì it combines elements of analysis and synthesis from various economic schools, from behavioral economics to political economics, as well as microeconomics with macroeconomics and global economics; # multidisciplinary ‚Äì the analysis of economic reality takes account of findings and methods of other disciplines of social sciences, most of all history, geography, philosophy, sociology, psychology, law and anthropology; # comparative ‚Äì the comparison of economic, cultural, geographic and political reality is treated as the basic research method. New pragmatism sees globalization ‚Äì the historical and spontaneous process of liberalizing and integrating various markets into one interconnected and internally consolidated worldwide system ‚Äì as an irreversible phenomenon. Hence, what becomes the fundamental economic problem of modern times is an effective coordination of economic policy and developmental strategies at a national and global level and rebuilding the institutional structure of global economy.

The fish and wildlife habitat is an approximately 65 acre area including Pine Brook south of the Boston Post Road, the Premium River, Premium Mill-Pond, the northeast portion of Echo Bay, and Pryer Manor Marsh.The land area bordering the wetlands complex is predominantly moderate density residential and commercial. The portion of the habitat area within Mamaroneck and Larchmont was designated as a 'Critical Environmental Area' under the State Environmental Quality Review Act. Fish and wildlife values The Premium River - Pine Brook Wetlands area is a diverse and relatively undeveloped complex of tidal river, tidal flats, shallows, salt marsh and freshwater wetlands which is unusual in Westchester County. Although adjacent and upstream developments and water pollution have degraded this area, the wetland complex remains undeveloped and the range of natural communities in this area support a diversity of fish and wildlife species. Local efforts are underway to preserve, maintain and restore the wetlands. As an initial step, the Department of State has funded the development of a wetland restoration and management plan for the Town of Mamaroneck and the Village of Larchmont. The productive salt marshes, tidal flats and shallows serve as nursery and feeding areas for a variety of finfish species including alewife, striped bass, blackfish, bluefish, cod, eel, winter flounder, summer flounder, mackerel, menhaden, porgy, weakfish, silversides and killifish. Shellfish found in the area include hard clam, soft clam, blue mussel, American oyster and bay scallop. Although the area was once used for planting and harvesting oysters, the entire area is now closed to shell- fishing due to degraded water quality (high coliform levels). A variety of coastal wildlife species occur in and around the Premium River - Pine Brook Wetlands. Nesting bird species include black-crowned night heron, ring-necked pheasant, mallard, Canada goose, mute swan and killdeer. Many species of waterfowl, shorebirds, marsh birds and passerine species feed in the area as residents during the summer and also during spring and fall migrations. Large concentrations of black duck occur during migrations and in recent years, osprey have been observed migrating through the area. Overwintering species include common loon, American coot, greater scaup, lesser scaup, northern shoveler, mallard, common goldeneye, canvasback, common merganser, hooded merganser and red-breasted merganser. The use of this area by waterfowl in winter is influenced by the extent of ice cover on Premium Mill Pond. Impact assessment The combination of this area's diverse natural communities and wildlife and its proximity to New York City and the densely populated region of Westchester County makes the Premium River - Pine Brook Wetlands area significant for informal nature study, birding, photography, environmental education and research. Any activity that would further degrade the water quality in Premium, River, Pine Brook, Premium Mill Pond and associated wetlands would impair the biological productivity of this area. Species of fish and wildlife may be affected by water pollution such as chemical contamination, oil spills, excessive sedimentation, waste disposal, and sewage discharges. Efforts should be made to improve water quality in the area by controlling runoff and waste discharge from adjacent and upstream commercial and residential areas and by improving tidal flushing. Elimination of freshwater wetlands, salt marsh and inter-tidal areas through excavation or filling, would result in a direct loss of valuable habitat area. Natural plant communities bordering the wetlands should be maintained to provide cover for wildlife, erosion control, and buffer zones.

The Saudi Arabian government had previously supported a school called the \\"New Arabic School\\", but withdrew funds to instead have King Fahd, which was to have more Arabic and Saudi-centred instruction, built. New Arabic School closed shortly afterward. At the time the school opened, the Saudi Embassy to Germany asked German officials to allow students of any nationality to attend King Fahd, but the German officials stated that all students except for children of diplomatic personnel were required to attend schools with curricula approved by German authorities. By the late 1990s embassies moved from Bonn, the former capital of West Germany, to Berlin, the capital of reunified Germany. Many Muslim immigrant families moved to Bad Godesberg, where the embassies and their staff were formerly located. Many parents permanently residing in Germany who wanted to give their children an Islamic education also began patronizing the school, and some moved to Bonn specifically so their children could attend this school. Der Spiegel stated that the school caused many Islamists to settle in Bonn. German authorities did not realize that the school was gaining a local Muslim student body as no central office processed the requests from parents to have their children attend King Fahd Academy instead of local German schools; the principals of the schools granted exceptions that allowed the children to attend King Fahd Academy. =2000s controversy and attempted closure= In 2003 the television documentary programme Panorama aired a special about the school. This documentary caused the school to suspend Anas Bayram, the imam, who had asked students to be trained in physical activities; the documentary stated that he was preparing students for jihad. William Boston of TIME wrote that there were \\"some distortions\\" within the documentary, including when it attributed a pro- September 11 essay written by a non-student to the school. Meanwhile officials from the local government obtained copies of the textbooks and class schedules and found that it had insufficient class hours devoted to academic subjects, an excessive amount of class hours devoted to religion, and textbook material that was for Islamist beliefs and against non-Muslims. In 2003 North Rhine Westphalia regional commissioner J√ºrgen Roters stated that he wished to close the school, accusing it of having connections to Islamist groups, including Mamduh Salim. German politicians were sensitive to Islamism since it was revealed that some September 11 attacks hijackers had spent time in Germany. Area politician Jamal Karsli and parents at the school opposed the planned closure. Some parents accused the area politicians of trying to stop the influx of Muslims into Bonn. Otto Schily, the Minister of the Interior, criticized the anti-King Fahd media and stated that the German government would continue to support the school.Khan, M. Ghazanfar Ali. \\"Germany Reiterates Support for King Fahd Academy .\\" Arab News. November 29, 2003. Retrieved on July 31, 2016. A high-ranking official in the German federal government told The Wall Street Journal that German officials did not want to lose cooperation with the Saudis and were afraid that if they closed this school, the Saudis would retaliate and close the German International School Riyadh. According to Melissa Eddy of The New York Times a \\"compromise\\" between German officials and the school kept it open. It meant that the mosque would be reserved for those who are connected with the school, and that German citizens would be barred from attending the school. All exemptions granted to allow German citizens to attend the school were revoked. Several hundred students had to leave King Fahd Academy, so some area domestic elementary schools began offering Arabic classes to help integrate the students. Saudi officials initially stated that King Fahd would move to Berlin, with the old building becoming a cultural centre. The Bonn school stayed open. =Planned closure= In 2012 protests and riots involving Muslims and German nationalists occurred outside of the school. As of 2009 the Saudi government was negotiating with the parliament of Berlin to have a new 400 student school established in Berlin.\\"Saudis wollen neue Schule in Berlin gr√ºnden.\\" Berliner Morgenpost. 20 October 2009.

As of 2004 it had 12 hours of Islamic education, nine hours of Arabic, and three hours of Saudi history per week. In 2003 Deutsche Welle stated that statistics stated that most graduates of King Fahd were going to reside in Germany after finishing their education but that \\"the school does little to integrate the children into their German surroundings\\". Student body As of 2003 the school had 195 students with German citizenship and about 405 students without German citizenship. Late in 2003 the student body was about 465, and by 2004 the student body had declined to 300, partly due to the loss of the German citizens. In 2008 the student body was 166.Robbers, Gerhard.

They are most commonly found in western India especially Gujarat where over 120 such wells are reported. The origin of the stepwell may be traced to reservoirs of the cities of the Indus Valley Civilization such as Dholavira and Mohenjo-daro. The stepwells were constructed in the south western region of Gujarat around 600 AD. From there they spread north to Rajasthan and subsequently to north and west India. Construction activities accelerated during the 10th to 13th century during the Chaulukya and Vaghela periods. The construction of these stepwells hit its peak during the 11th to 16th century. The Muslim rulers of the 13th to 16th century did not disrupt the culture that was practiced in these stepwells and encouraged the building of stepwells. The wells lost their significance in the 19th century due to introduction of water pumps and pipe- systems. Ancient period Water reservoir, with steps, at Dholavira The stepped well may have originated to ensure water during drought periods. The water is considered sacred from the time of Vedas and the steps to reach the water level in artificially construed reservoirs can be found in the sites of Indus Valley Civilization such as Dholavira and Mohenjo-daro. 2nd-10th century left left The earliest example of a bath-like pond reached by steps is found at the Uparkot caves in Junagadh. These caves have been dated to the 4th century. Navghan Kuvo, a well with circular staircase, in the vicinity, is another example. It was possibly built in the Western Satrap (200-400 AD) or Maitraka (600-700 AD) period though some place it as late as the 11th century. The nearby Adi Kadi ni Vav is constructed either in the second half of the 10th century or 15th century. The earliest stepwells are found at Dhank in Rajkot district of Gujarat; they are dated to the pre-Chalukyan period. The nearby Bochavdi stepwell near Bochavdi Nes in Alech hills is slightly earlier than two other stepwells in Dhank. These are the Jhilani stepwell dated to 600 AD and the Manjushri stepwell dated to the early 7th century based on their Saurastra style architecture. 10th-12th century Rani ki vav left The stepwell as a form of artistic architecture started during the Chaulukya period. The stepwell situated west of kund of Modhera Sun Temple may belong to the 11th century whereas the mandapa above ground is from the 10th century. The Rani ki vav (the Queen's stepwell) of Patan was constructed around 1050 AD. Ankol Mata stepwell at Davad and Mata Bhavani's Stepwell in Ahmedabad belonged to the third quarter of the 11th century. Several stepwells are ascribed to Minaldevi, the mother of Chaulukya ruler Jayasimha Siddharaja. The lake in Viramgam and a stepwell in Nadiad are ascribed to her. The Minal stepwell in Balej village in Sabarkantha district is ascribed to her and was built in 1095 AD (Samvat 1152). Another Minaldevi Vav in Virpur in Rajkot district is also ascribed to her and has stylistic affinities to Chaulukya architecture. Asapuri stepwell of Ahmedabad and the stepwell of Jhinjhuwada are of the 12th century. The Chaumukhi stepwell of Chobari in Surendranagar district depicts religious figures similar to nearby temples. The stepwell in Dhandhalpur is ascribed to Jayasimha Siddharaja. During the reign of Kumarapala in the 12th century, several stepwells were constructed. The stepwell at Vayad near Patan was built during this time. Ganga stepwell at Wadhwan has been dated to 1169 AD (Samvat 1225). During the later years of the Chaulukya period, construction slowed down due to political unrest. The Vikia and Jetha stepwells near Navlakha Temple, Ghumli near the Barda hills belonged to the 13th century. The Gyan stepwell near Visavada village in the Barda hills is ascribed to the time of Bhima II. The ruined stepwell of nearby Keshav village is of the same period. 12th-13th century The Ra Khengar stepwell between Vanthali and Junagadh is stated to be constructed by Tejapala of the Vastupala-Tejapala, the brother-ministers in Vaghela court. It belongs to the early Vaghela period. Visaldev of Vaghela dynasty built the stepwell along with gates and temples at Dabhoi, completed in 1255. The Satmukhi stepwell in Dabhoi is a temple built over a tank with seven wells ascribed to him. The Madhavav in Wadhwan was built in 1294 AD (Vikram Samvat 1350) by Nagar Brahmin Madha and Keshav, the ministers in court of the last Vaghela ruler Karna. The Batris Kotha stepwell in Kapadvanj may have belonged to the 13th century due to its similarity with the Madha and Vikia stepwells. 14th-15th century Adalaj Stepwell Dada Harir Stepwell A large number of stepwells were constructed in the 14th century. Sodhali stepwell in Mangrol was built in 1319 AD (V. S. 1375) by Vali Sodhala of Modha caste. The stepwell near the Brahma temple of Khedbrahma belonged to the 14th century judged by its style. The Suda stepwell in Mahuva (1381 AD), Hani stepwell in Dhandhusar (1389/1333 AD) and Siddhnath Mahadev stepwell in Dholka were built during Tughluq rule in Gujarat. The stepwell of Sampa near Ahmedabad was built in 1328 AD. The Rajba stepwell of Rampura near Wadhwan and the Wadhwani stepwell in Khambhat were built in 1483 and 1482 respectively based on the earlier Madha stepwell of Wadhwan. The Dada Harir Stepwell was built in 1499 by the harem lady of Mahmud Begada. The two stepwells in Kaleshwari-Ni Nal near Lunawada belongs to 14-15th century but the iconography in it belongs to 10th century. During this period, the religious aspect of stepwells lost its significance. The stepwell of Sodali village near Mahemdavad and the stepwell in Mahemdavad itself, both of which belonged to the 15th century rule of Mahmud Begada, are its example. The two stepwells found in and around Vadodara are of the 15th century; one is near Sewasi village (V. S. 1537) and the other is the Navalakhi stepwell (1405 AD) of Laxmi Vilas Palace. The Adalaj Stepwell was constructed by Rudabai in 1499 AD. A nearby stepwell in Chhatral also belongs to the same period. 16th-18th century Amritavarshini Vav The Nagabawa stepwell in Dhrangdhra (1525 AD) and Jiva Mehta stepwell in Morbi are of the same style and period. The stepwell of Roho (1560 AD) was built by Champa, the wife of Raja Shri Nanaji and her daughter. There are also important stepwells in Palanpur and Jhinjhuwada. Several stepwells are plain in design without any ornamentation which makes it difficult to ascertain their period, but they may belong to the 16th or 17th century. Such stepwells are in Hampur and Idar, as well as the Matri stepwell in Kankavati and Gyaneshwari stepwell in Modhera. The stepwell of Mandva in north Gujarat is similar to that of Mahemdavad so may belong to that period. The Sindhvai Mata stepwell in Patan has an inscription dating to 1633 AD. The Ravli stepwell of Mangrol is of the 17th century. The stepwell in Limboi near Idar has Chaulukya style ornamentation and has been dated to 1629 AD. The Amritavarshini Vav in Ahmedabad, completed in 1723, is L-shaped. 19th-20th century The authorities during the British Raj found the hygiene of the stepwells less than desirable and installed pipe and pump systems to replace their purpose. Jethabhai's Stepwell in Isanpur, Ahmedabad was completed in the 1860s for irrigation. The stepwell of Wankaner palace was built by erstwhile rulers in the 1930s as a cool place of retreat for the royal family. It was built in white sandstone and is the last monument of its kind. Due to waterpumps and pipe-systems, the stepwells lost their significance and due to economic cost, they were not constructed thereafter.

Under the name Aaron Star he founded the Naked Yoga movement in New York City, which incorporates elements of both partner and tantric yoga and is performed while being nude.  Early life and career  At 18, Star began working out at a Vancouver community center. He realized that keeping in shape was a lifelong responsibility and became a student of yoga in 1991 and a teacher in 1997. He travelled across the world visiting numerous yoga ashrams and retreat centers, studying with yoga teachers including Bryan Kest, Rod Stryker, Swami Rama, as well as with other spiritual masters in the Himalayas. Star arrived in Manhattan in 2001 and within a short time was offering retreats in different countries. It was during a retreat in Hawaii that Star and his longtime student, Adam, first discussed creating \\"a community that is yoga-based‚Ä¶ and where people can heal their spirits.\\" Six years later, they purchased property in Costa Rica and formed what is today known as Blue Osa. Star popularized the idea of practicing Hot Nude Yoga which garnered a large following of men in the gay community of New York. Since then it has spread out in Chicago, Los Angeles and Boston. He started the Hot Nude Yoga movement in Chelsea, New York in 2001 in the building on the Southwest corner of 23rd Street and Sixth Avenue. Star speaks on various topics, most commonly on freedom of oneself and how to be free along with being comfortable with oneself. Fulfillment of life‚Äôs purpose is another common topic he speaks and writes about. = Autobiography of a Naked Yogi = Star wrote Autobiography of a Naked Yogi in 2015. In it, he details how an upbringing in 70‚Äôs British Columbia, Canada along with a confrontational childhood and a brutal boarding school education set him on an altogether different trajectory.

Reviewing the book, BroadwayWorld wrote that \\"Yogi Aaron's narrative is one of empowerment, imbued with a sense of adventure.\\"  Criticism  Star‚Äôs Hot Nude Yoga classes received criticism for its heightened sensuality. The book Yoga in the Modern World: Contemporary Perspectives calls Hot Nude Yoga \\"A promotion of sexual expression that would have scandalized the likes of Swami Sivananda\\", while it was also defined as \\"soft-core pornography\\" by Stewart J Lawrence in The Guardian. Joshua Stein, editor for OUT Magazine, who has attended the class wrote that the quality of yoga was diminished by heightened sensuality and according to The Associated Press, Hot Nude Yoga seems to be a \\"form of sensualized tantric yoga practiced nude.\\" References Yoga teachers 1972 births Living people ","title":"Yogi Aaron"},{"id":"51150074","text":"The Confederaci√≥n Nacional de Organizaciones Populares (CNOP, \\"National Confederation of Popular Organizations\\") is a political institution of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) in Mexico. It was founded in 1943 and has historically served to represent the middle and lower classes within the party organization. Although a major sector of the PRI, it has been less studied that the worker and peasant sectors.Davis, Diane, \\"Confederaci√≥n Nacional de Organizaciones Populares (CNOP)\\" in Encyclopedia of Mexico. Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, pp. 289-294. Its Secretary General is Senator Cristina D√≠az Salazar. History The creation of the CNOP in Guadalajara, Jalisco in February 1943 responded to the increasing middle class in Mexico in the early 20th century and the need to adequately represent them within the corporatist structure of the PRI, then known as the Party of the Mexican Revolution (PRM).Emilio Mario Coral Garc√≠a, \\"The Mexico City Middle Class, 1940‚Äì1970: Between Tradition, the State, and the United States\\". Dissertation, Georgetown University, 2011. It replaced the party's Popular Sector, which included the middle class and, from 1940, representatives of the military, after the military sector was abolished at the initiative of Manuel √Åvila Camacho. While it also intended to represent those not included in either of the PRI's two other large representative institutions, the Confederation of Mexican Workers (CTM) and (National Rural Confederation), it was dominated by the middle class, and seven of its ten branches ultimately represented that sector of society. Moreover, its primary function in the PRM/PRI system was to simultaneously create a mediated venue for political participation while securing middle-class support for PRI policies and creating a farm system for new politicians, loyal to the president, outside of the CTM and CNC; this was particularly important during a time when √Åvila Camacho needed \\"a loyal creature of the executive\\" and an institution to balance the CTM and CNC, both roles the CNOP filled.Leslie Bethell, ed. \\"Mexico, c. 1930‚Äì46\\" in The Cambridge History of Latin America. The \\"backbone\\" of the CNOP was the Federation of Unions of Workers in State Service (FSTSE), a holdover from the government of L√°zaro C√°rdenas; this organization connected the CNOP and the federal government, and given the dominance of bureaucrats in the former, it held considerable sway. The CNOP continued to grow in power and size through the government of Miguel Alem√°n Vald√©s, which emphasized urban development and sought to target the country's urban middle class. Given the post-1946 focus on stability and government institutions, and thus on the middle class, the CNOP continued to become an institution devoted to the development of new political leaders. It also allowed the government to exercise political muscle against the CTM and CNC, particularly in the demands for higher wages that followed the 1948 devaluation of the Mexican peso. As its relative influence in the PRI structure grew, so too did the proportion of federal legislators that were members; the middle class represented 43% of deputies in 1943 and 55% in 1967. However, as agitation grew in the PRI for change and reform, the CNOP's national importance waned. In 2015, the CNOP moved to new headquarters on Plaza de la Rep√∫blica, which had previously been the former facilities of the Direcci√≥n Federal de Seguridad, which Proceso described as \\"the most sinister building in the country\\".
