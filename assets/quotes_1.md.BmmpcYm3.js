a particular tax jurisdiction in which the corporation or group has a taxable presence. It is an alternative to separate entity accounting, under which a branch or subsidiary within the jurisdiction is accounted for as a separate entity, requiring prices for transactions with other parts of the corporation or group to be assigned according to the arm's length standard commonly used in transfer pricing. In contrast, formulary apportionment attributes the corporation's total worldwide profit (or loss) to each jurisdiction, based on factors such as the proportion of sales, assets or payroll in that jurisdiction. When applied to a corporate group, formulary apportionment requires combined reporting of the group's results. The parent and all of its subsidiaries are viewed as though they were a single entity (unitary combination), and the method is then also known as worldwide unitary taxation. In the US, most states have adopted water's edge combined reporting which restricts the taxable group to just US domestic corporations and excludes \\"overseas business organization\\", i.e., unitary foreign affiliates and foreign parents. In US taxation Formulary methods are used in both the United States and Canada to apportion income of corporations between the sub- national jurisdictions in which they operate. In many U.S. states formulary apportionment is also used to apportion the combined income of a related group of companies. Tax in each US state is thus assessed based on the unitary combination of all related entities. The related entities included in the unitary combination may be worldwide entities or only entities within the United States, depending on the state. The latter is known as water's edge combined reporting. Worldwide unitary combined reporting was first approved by the US Supreme Court in 1983 in Container Corp. v. Franchise Tax Board (CA) by a vote of 5-3 (Justice Stevens did not participate). The court re-visited worldwide combined reporting in 1994 in Barclays Bank v. Franchise Tax Board (CA) and Colgate-Palmolive v. Franchise Tax Board (CA) and again approved its use by California but this time by larger majorities. The votes were 7-2 and 9-0, respectively. However, as a result of foreign retaliatory legislation and pressure from the federal government, all states have now abandoned mandatory worldwide combined reporting. The use of formulary apportionment in the United States dates back to the late 19th century. At that time, there was no state or federal corporate income tax, but the states did assess property and capital stock taxes. With the growth of the transcontinental railroads, state taxation authorities faced companies which had not just immovable property (tracks) but also non-trivial movable property (rolling stock) operating across state lines. The property value of a company assessable to state tax was thus assessed by examining the proportion of value of railway lines within the state, and then taking that proportion of the company's total value (including the movable property) as the portion of value located within a certain state. When Wisconsin adopted a state income tax in 1911, it also used formulary apportionment (based on property, cost of manufacture, and sales), pointing to the impracticality of otherwise calculating separate accounts for companies operating in multiple states. By the mid-20th century, the \\"Massachusetts Formula\\" had become a commonly used standard of formulary apportionment. The formula placed an equal weight on three factors: group sales, payroll, and property within each jurisdiction. Out of the forty-four states (plus one more jurisdiction, the District of Columbia) which imposed a corporate income tax in 1978, all but Iowa used the Massachusetts Formula.; see also Moorman Mfg. Co. v. Bair (437 US 267) Iowa's formula ignored payroll and property, looking solely at sales; the constitutionality of this formula was challenged in the Moorman case in Iowa, and it was held invalid by a trial court under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment as well as the Commerce Clause of Article One; however, the Iowa Supreme Court reversed the trial court in 1978. This marked the beginning of a trend towards increasing weight on sales at the expense of the other two factors; by 2004, there were only twelve states still using an equally weighted formula. In international taxation Formulary apportionment is not used as a method of attributing profit between (rather than within) national tax jurisdictions. The adoption of formulary apportionment has been advocated at various times since the 1970s. The matter has been hotly debated by OECD member states beginning in the 1970s. In 2000 Joann Weiner and Charles E. McLure Jr. proposed the use of formulary apportionment within the European Union. In 2001, the EU issued a communication advocating the use of formulary apportionment.http://eur- lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2001:0582:FIN:EN:PDF In 2007 Kimberley A. Clausing and Reuven Avi-Yonah suggested that the US Internal Revenue Service use formulary apportionment in the assessment of federal corporate income tax, believing it would lead to increased tax revenue in the face of a trend for multinational corporations to use transfer pricing to shift profits out of the US into low-tax countries. None of these suggestions has been adopted. Several US states allow, but do not mandate, that a corporate group include foreign entities for the purpose of assessing factors used in formulary apportionment (\\"worldwide unitary combination\\"). California, for example, began to accept worldwide unitary combination in the 1940s. However, its attempt to require such combination led to strong protests from US trading partners. The UK-US double taxation treaty signed in 1975 included a provision to prohibit US states from \\"tak[ing] into account the income, deductions, receipts, or out-goings of a related enterprise\\" in the United Kingdom or any other country for the purpose of determining tax liability.US- UK Income Tax Convention (1975) Article 9(4) However, the US Senate, whose consent was required to ratify the treaty, rejected this provision, and the treaty was amended by a protocol in 1979.US-UK Income Tax Convention (1975) Protocol 3 The Supreme Court explicitly held worldwide unitary combination as constitutional in separate cases in 1983 and 1994 (Barclays Bank PLC v. Franchise Tax Board).114 S.Ct. 2268 In 1985 the United Kingdom passed retaliatory legislation which would have overridden the UK-US tax treaty and denied significant UK tax benefits to corporations headquartered in US states which applied worldwide unitary taxation.Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 Section 812 This and further pressure from foreign governments, the executive branch and multinational corporations led US states to adopt a \\"water's edge\\" limitation on unitary combination, allowing taxpayers to decide for themselves whether or not to include foreign entities in their combined reporting.  Criticism  Advocates claim that transfer pricing issues increase compliance costs, formulary apportionment reduces those costs and treating associated enterprises in a unitary fashion more closely reflects the underlying operating realities of multinational enterprises. Critics argue: *Formulary apportionment leads to double taxation of the same profits unless there is agreement among all the jurisdictions on the formula to be used and the composition of the combined group. *Tax could be avoided by manipulation of the components of the formula like the location of mobile assets. *Compliance costs would be increased by the need to calculate each component of the formula in each jurisdiction. *Compliance costs would be much higher unless all jurisdictions adopted a common method of calculating taxable profits. Otherwise a separate calculation of worldwide group profits would be required under each jurisdiction's tax accounting rules. The issue is significantly reduced within the United States and Canada because variations among each jurisdiction's tax accounting methods are relatively minor.http://www.taxjournal.com/tj/articles/debate-should-we-move-system- unitary-taxation-18122012 *If members of the group account in different currencies, currency exchange rate movements could distort the results of the apportionment. *Formulary apportionment does not reflect the economic profit or loss of each entity. For example, a profitable group that incurs a loss in a particular territory has taxable profit apportioned to that territory, and conversely a loss-making group which makes profits in a particular territory has no taxable profits in that territory.

He joined the Brisbane Bears in 1991 and played reserves football at the club for two seasons before continuing his career in South Australia with South Adelaide. It was from South Adelaide that he was recruited to the AFL, with Footscray using the 43rd selection in the 1995 Draft to secure his services. The dreadlocked West was already 23 when he made his senior AFL debut in 1996 and made only four appearances in his debut season. He struggled to make much of an impact in 1997 until the finals series, with a career high 24 disposals and two goals coming in the preliminary final loss to Adelaide. With just under three minutes remaining, West received a handball inside the forward 50 and had a running shot at goal which missed to the left. Had he kicked the goal, the Bulldogs would have gone eight points up. West missed most of the 1998 AFL season with a shoulder injury but recovered in time to play in another preliminary final, where his club was again defeated by Adelaide.

Among his clients were world-famous female personalities like Coco Chanel, Queen Marie of Romania, Sarah Bernhardt, Greta Garbo, U.S. First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, and Brigitte Bardot.  Early life  Cierplikowski was born in Sieradz, Poland, and learnt hairdressing by working for his uncle in Łódź. In December 1901, he moved to Paris, France. He married Berthe Astier on 24 January 1909 in London, England, where they were both learning English.  Career  After moving to Paris, Cierplikowski worked in the salon at Galeries Lafayette. During the summer season, he worked in Deauville, following the high society of Paris who vacationed there. In 1904, he created a stylish coiffure for Lily de Moure when she lost her fashionable hat. Her appearance without a hat on the arm of a royal prince caused a sensation; other fashionable ladies soon decided to have their hair styled by Cierplikowski. In 1909, Cierplikowski started a fashion for a short bob cut which was inspired by Joan of Arc. In the 1920s, he introduced the shingle cut which became popular with daring young women -- the Bloomsbury set and flappers. In 1924, he dyed his dog's hair blue. This blue hair was taken up by the first professional interior designer, Lady Elsie De Wolfe Mendl, which started a new fad. He created the “garconne” hairstyle for the likes of Coco Chanel, Josephine Baker, and Edith Piaf. His creations were rumoured to cost up to 500 francs - more than £1,000 in today's money. In the 1930s, he introduced blonde highlights and a style of upswept hair. In 1924, Cierplikowski opened a salon at Saks Fifth Avenue in New York which became the most fashionable hair salon in America. Other famous hairdressers, including Sydney Guilaroff, established their reputations there. The peak of Antoine's career was the coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth in 1937, when he supervised 400 coiffures in one night.  Later life  After the death of his wife in 1973, Cierplikowski returned to his birthplace, Sieradz, where he died in July 1976.

It is the biggest reservoir in Poland. Due to the significant amount of organic matter in the tank (approx. 11.5% of the dry weight of sediment), it emits approx. 400 mg of methane per area of 1 m² (which is approx. 27% of the total amount of gases emitted from the sediment of average 3114 ml m−2 d−1).

He formerly played professional cricket for Victoria in Australian domestic cricket. Early life Born in Shepparton in northern Victoria, Keath completed his schooling at Goulburn Valley Grammar School and Melbourne Grammar School. He was a talented junior in both football and cricket, and drew the attention of professional recruiters from both sports. In 2009, after excelling at under-18s football for the Murray Bushrangers in the TAC Cup, he was recruited by the newly established Gold Coast Suns football club, which at that time was recruiting twelve 17-year-olds in a separate draft before it entered the Australian Football League in 2011. At the same time, Keath had excelled as a junior cricketer, and represented Australia in their successful 2010 Under-19 Cricket World Cup, and was offered a three-year Cricket Victoria contract. Cricket career In April 2010, Keath chose to proceed with cricket, accepting his Cricket Victoria contract. An all rounder who bowled medium pace, Keath made his first-class cricket debut against the touring England team in December 2010 making 46. Over the following five years, he failed to earn a regular spot in the Victorian team, playing a total of seven first-class matches and sixteen List A matches, averaging less than twenty with the bat in both formats, as well as five Twenty20 matches for the Melbourne Stars. He played premier cricket for Melbourne during that time, scoring 2101 runs at 35.01 and taking 79 wickets at 19.62. At the end of the 2014–15 season, Keath lost his Cricket Victoria contract. He spent the 2015 season playing in England in the Birmingham Premier League, and upon his return to Australia signed for South Australian Grade Cricket club Prospect. On 8 December 2015 Keath was signed by the Adelaide Strikers in the Big Bash LeagueAFL rookie Alex Keath signs with BBL but was not offered a first class contract with the South Australian Cricket Association (SACA). Football career Despite being drafted to the Gold Coast Suns in 2009, Keath was eligible to be drafted as a Category B rookie from 2013 as he had not played for an Australian rules football club at any level for three years. His shift to South Australian grade cricket attracted the attention of football recruiters, and in October 2015 he was signed by the Adelaide Football Club as a Category B rookie. Despite being on the football club's list, cricket initially remained Keath's primary focus season, with Adelaide's recruitment of him in the hope that he would switch to football at the end of the 2015–16 summer season. After he failed to earn a SACA contract, he began playing SANFL football for the Adelaide reserves in the 2016 winter season. In 2017, Keath was named co-captain of the Adelaide Crows SANFL team. Keath made his debut for the Adelaide Crows AFL side against the Geelong Cats at Adelaide Oval on 21 July 2017, filling in for the injured Jake Lever and Kyle Hartigan. At the end of the 2019 AFL season Keath officially requested a trade to the Western Bulldogs.

It was founded in 1983 by Holger Wobker and Peter Sawatzki in Hamburg, Germany as Kapitän Sehnsucht (Captain Desire). The original Boytronic released two synthpop albums: The Working Model (1983) and The Continental (1985). The record company, claiming rights to the band name, put together a completely different line-up in 1986. It was headed by Hayo Lewerentz (Hayo Panarinfo) (U96/Major Records) and continued to record under the Boytronic name until the mid-1990s. In 2002, Boytronic was revived by Wobker from the original group and Panarinfo from the second incarnation. They released the albums Autotunes, Maxi and remastered editions of The Working Model (Reverse) and The Continental (Replace) with bonus tracks. The albums was released on Hayo Lewerentz label Major Records. Wobker teamed up with his Beachhead bandmate Hans Johm (Antlers Mulm) and Michael Maria Ziffels for the Dependence (2006) album. On this album the song \\"Forever\\" from The Continental album, sees its German version as \\"Für Immer\\". The band had three charting singles in Germany.

The film received positive reviews from the film critics upon release. It won several national and international awards. It won the National Film Award for Best Screenplay and the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Kannada of 2010. Plot A story has a beginning, middle and an end, but it's not necessary that they be in that order. Girish Kasarvalli's award- winning Kanasembo Kudureyaneri (based on Amaresh Nugadoni's Savaari) is a classic example of this. The film applies a back and forth narrative to tell the story of gravedigger Irya and his belief in Siddhas, nomads whose arrival is considered auspicious. It is believed that if the death of a person coincides with the arrival of a Siddha, the soul is sure to go to heaven. Irya and his wife are made known of their arrival through dreams. In fact for Irya, if a Siddha appears in his dream, it denotes a death in the village. However, once despite dreaming of a Siddha, Irya is told that there is no death in the village. He goes to the house of an ailing village elder, anticipating his death but is sent back by the caretaker saying all is well. As if this is not enough, a Siddha not arriving in the village despite his wife having dreamt of his arrival, crushes Irya's faith in Siddhas, who he believes are his protectors. Is Irya an easy prey to superstitions or are scheming villagers exploiting his dreams for their own good? The film beautifully exposes the materialistic attitude of people. It leaves you wondering whether destroying one's beliefs is the only way to progress; whether there are chances of beliefs being mistaken for superstitions just because the ones who hold these beliefs are not part of the mainstream. While the first half of the film may have you raise your brows at Irya's and Rudri's dreams and faith, the second half sets out to suggest that what may look superstitious to one may be a way of life to the other. It also shows how sometimes what looks real may be unreal and vice versa, and that with faith in our beliefs, we can achieve anything.

Etymology The surname Cowley has numerous origins. In some cases it originated as a habitational name, derived from any of the several places in England named Cowley. One such place, in Gloucestershire, is derived from two Old English elements: the first, cu, meaning \\"cow\\"; the second element, leah, meaning \\"woodland clearing\\". Two other places are located in Derbyshire which are derived from the Old English col, meaning \\"coal\\" (in reference to charcoal). Another place is located near London, which can has two possible derivations: the first is from the Old English cofa, meaning \\"shelter\\" or \\"bay\\"; the second possibility is that this place name is derived from the Old English personal name Cofa. Other places are located in Buckinghamshire, Devon, Oxfordshire, and Staffordshire: these place names are thought to be derived from elements meaning \\"the wood or clearing of Cufa\\", although they may also contain topographical elements as well.

In about and 55 day hikes, it runs through the arc formed by the western Alps from the Pennine Alps through the Graian and Cottian Alps to the Maritime and Ligurian Alps. There are a number of transverse valleys along the route. Day hikes typically connect high-lying valley communities with each other via historic pass routes.  Route  The 55-day length of the GTA Rimella, at the trail's northern end Rocciamelone, at the highest mountain on the GTA that can be climbed as a detour Usseaux in Chisone Po Valley View from Valle Maira of Monte Viso Traditional houses in Chiappera, Acceglio, in the Valle Maira Ormea Viozene, at the south end of the trail The GTA may be walked in either direction; the following direction is from north to south. The trail begins in the Pennine Alps; the original plan to let the GTA start on Lago Maggiore has not been implemented due to the lack of suitable accommodations. The official start is at Molini di Calasca in Valle Anzasca; however, Forno in Valstrona is also used, and some walkers start at Valais, Switzerland. The trail follows the north side of Valsesia to Alagna, near Monte Rosa. There the route bends south, avoiding the Aosta valley (which is not part of the Piedmont). The trail passes Oropa and reaches Quincinetto, in the valley where the Dora Baltea breaks through from Val d'Aosta into the lowlands of the Po. At , it is the lowest point of the GTA. The GTA then enters the Graian Alps, leading (in six sections) west. It passes Gran Paradiso near the French border, where it continues south. After crossing the three valleys of Lanzo Torinese, the Susa Valley is reached after 26 sections. This is the approximate midpoint of the GTA, and the boundary between its northern and southern parts. In the Cottian Alps, between the Susa and Varaita valleys, were several variants of the GTA. An eastern route, snow-free by early June, is neglected; the main, western route is well-maintained. The GTA runs south from the Susa Valley, crossing the Chisone, Germanasca, and Pellice Valleys. The Monte Viso bypass uses two huts belonging to the Club Alpino Italiano. The trail then crosses the Varaita, Maira, Grana, Stura di Demonte, Gesso, and Vermenagna Valleys. Near Monte Argentera, in the Maritime Alps, are several more Club Alpino Italiano huts. The GTA then enters the Ligurian Alps, ending at Viozene in Ormea. Trail extensions continue to the train stations at Ormea or Gerassio, cross to the Alta Via dei Monti Liguri or lead to the Mediterranean Sea (which can be reached in about three days from Ormea). The GTA is usually snow-free at the end of June. A mountain trail, it has no technical difficulties; however, trail marking is irregular. The typical elevation difference is per day. Especially in the northern part, some sections are lengthy.  Accommodations and maps  The section between Forno and Viozene may be hiked without camping; accommodations are available (posto tappa, with a red-and-white GTA flag), usually with half board. Some accommodations are simple (for example, a dormitory with bunk beds in an old school house); others are in private homes. The GTA runs partially along the Sentiero Italia and Via Alpina (red-blue trail). Trail markers are red and white, some with \\"GTA\\" or \\"SI\\" in black. As part of an EU-funded initiative, Via Alpina boards were set up for each section. However, the trail is difficult to find in large towns and few local residents are familiar with the GTA. Maps published by the Turin Istituto Centrale Geografico (IGC) are unreliable; entries for trails outside the GTA may be outdated (the trails are overgrown, or blocked by landslides). During the 1990s, a French-Italian joint project published several cross-border 1:50,000-scale maps (with EU support) from the French National Geographic Institute; however, they are out of print. Local maps are sometimes available in scales ranging from 1:40,000 to 1:25,000; their quality varies. A two volume Italian guidebook has been published in 2011 (Southern part, Viozene to Susa) and 2016 (Northern part, Susa to Lago Maggiore).  Landscape and culture  The GTA is a subalpine, montane trail primarily traversing a previously cultivated, densely populated landscape. Traditional mountain farming largely collapsed during the 20th century; areas in the GTA valleys suffered a population decline of 80 percent between 1870 and 2000, and the upper valley communities lost between 90 and 95 percent. Some abandoned hamlets had populations of about 100; others have one or two older residents left. Some descendants of original residents, heirs to property, return to the hamlets during summer as a second home; however, most houses have fallen into disrepair. The GTA often runs along old roads which formerly connected hamlets;The communities were organized locally: in a village was the church in another town hall, in yet another school , so each village was connected to any direct way, the routing - a ravine around or up and down to the valley floor again? . - Was optimized for Heel mulattieras (mule paths) traversed chestnut forests which were destroyed by a 19th-century blight. At higher altitudes, old agricultural terraces and boundary walls may still be seen. The Alpine valleys were culturally independent, and had contact with neighboring areas in France, Switzerland and the Po Valley. The Valsesia has long been settled by the Walser. In the Lanzo Valleys, as in the Aosta Valley, Arpitan was spoken; in the lower Susa Valley, the language was Piedmontese. South of the Susa Valley, the Occitan language predominated. Only during World War I did a significant part of the population begin speakingItalian. During the second half of the 20th century, there was the decline in regional languages; however, some Occitan speakers still remain in remote valleys. The Waldensian Evangelical Church has a following in the region.  History  The GTA originated from a similar trail in France established about 1970, and is part of a network of European long-distance footpaths traversing the Alps. During the mid-1970s, a group of Turin mountain-hiking enthusiasts expanded the concept of a long-distance path following the Piedmontese Alpine arc around the Rivista della Montagna and libreria della Montagna. The volunteers later formed the Associazione GTA. The associated organized overnight accommodations and marked the trails, attracting public funds. From 1981 to 1989 a hiking guide was published in book form, and in 1982 a formal tour was organized to publicize the trail.Vogt, 2008, pp. 115ff. The GTA experienced a boom in 1979, with up to 300 overnight hikers per section per season. After a few years interest by Italian hikers waned, and some posti tappa on the eastern route in the southern part closed. The GTA volunteer base shrank during the 1990s.Vogt, 2008, pp. 129ff. In 2008, the Associazione GTA had shrunk to seven members; besides one dedicated member in the province of Cuneo they are largely inactive. Their continued existence is justified by the fact that only allows a licensing embodied connection to this club the shelter, preserve their special status as rifugio escursionistico to maintain order and to avoid more stringent requirements of the hotel and catering law. Since 1985, the GTA has been promoted in the German-speaking area of Werner Bätzing as an example of environmentally friendly tourism. The association's hiking guide has been updated regularly since 1989; however, the number of hikers has decreased.Vogt, 2008, p.130 Hikers walk the GTA predominantly from German- speaking regions. The average stay is a week, and there are many returning walkers. The exact number of overnight stays in individual sections is unavailable, but are typically 100 to 200 per season. An estimated 1,000 long- distance hikers walk the GTA each season.Vogt, 2008, pp. 285ff. and 315ff.

The intent is that the prolonged absence of the fugitive couple would let their families presume that sexual intercourse had occurred and thus force them to consent to a so-called \\"rehabilitating wedding\\" (). Such elopements still occur today, but the practice is becoming less common because of changing social and cultural conditions. While elopements of young couples are reported to be widespread in places such as Palermo (over 300 have been reported to occur each year), most of them only bear a surface relationship with traditional fuitine, as they are not necessarily aimed at a rehabilitating marriage. In principle, the term fuitina refers only to the consensual elopement of a couple, but the practice also lends itself to be appealed to in order to camouflage actual kidnapping, and possibly rape, of the bride-to-be. A prominent example is the 1966 trial for rape where the lawyer of the kidnapper and rapist of Franca Viola maintained that the woman had actually consented to a fuitina. The trial had a wide resonance in Italy, as Franca Viola refused the \\"rehabilitating\\" marriage. The trial contributed to spread the awareness that because of the existing social ties (and specifically, the widespread notion that a woman who lost her virginity was not \\"worthy\\" to be married), women who suffered rape were often pressed to marry their rapists (especially, but not exclusively, if they got pregnant), or they would lose their honour and be marginalized by the society. The aftermath of her trial ruled that rapists were no longer able to avoid punishment through the marriage of their victims. In 1981, Italy repealed Article 544. The Italian Code of Criminal Procedure (art. 537) prosecutes (consensual) fuitina if the bride-to-be is a minor, equating it to the kidnapping of a consenting minor.

History KZME went on the air in the autumn of 2011 and gathered steadily increasing listenership due to its unique music programming. Most of the programming consisted of local Portland-based and Pacific Northwest original music which found favor with local listeners seeking alternatives to the standard chain-radio fare of most other music-oriented radio stations in the greater Portland area. Occasional volunteer DJs played music live on the air, with daytime gaps and nights consisting of pre- programmed local music. Occasional guest DJs, like Dr. Demento (when he appears in Portland each winter), did live shows on the station also. The format of the station leaned toward pop and rock, which dominates daytime programming, but occasionally showcased alternative local music such as electronic, ambient, industrial, rap, ethnic, and experimental music on some evenings and weekends. The station was located in Gresham, Oregon just east of Portland and its transmitter (translator) antenna was located in the west hills of Portland, reaching most of the Portland-area Willamette Valley and to most of greater Vancouver, Washington and Clark County just across the Columbia River.

He received his PhD in music composition from the University of California, San Diego where he studied with Brian Ferneyhough, Joji Yuasa, Rand Steiger, and Roger Reynolds. Prior to Stanford, Applebaum taught at UCSD, Mississippi State University, and Carleton College. He has received commissions from Betty Freeman, the Merce Cunningham Dance Company, the Fromm Foundation, the Kronos Quartet, the Paul Dresher Ensemble, Spoleto USA, the Vienna Modern Festival, Antwerp’s Champ D’Action, Festival ADEvantgarde in Munich, Zeitgeist, Manufacture (Tokyo), the St. Lawrence String Quartet, the Jerome Foundation, and the American Composers Forum. Applebaum's solo, chamber, choral, orchestral, operatic, and electro-acoustic work has been performed through North and South America, Europe, Australia, Africa, and Asia. His music has been described as mercurial, high detailed, discipline, and exacting, but also features improvisational and whimsical aspects. His inspiration has been drawn from jazz pioneers and maverick composers such as Nancarrow and Partch, who found it necessary to use or invent unusual instruments to realize their artistic visions.James Bash As a jazz pianist, Applebaum has performed around the world, including a solo recital in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso that was sponsored by the American Embassy. In 1994 he received the jazz prize of the Southern California Jazz Society. Electroacoustic instruments In 1990 Applebaum began building unique instruments called electroacoustic instruments. One of these instruments Applebaum refers to as the \\"Mouseketier\\" consists of threaded rods, nails, combs, doorstops, springs, squeaky wheels, ratchets, and a toilet tank flotation bulb. His first instrument, the “Mousetrap,” is used in Mousetrap Music which features a recording of sound-sculpture improvisations. The objects on the instruments are plucked, scratched, bowed, and modified by a battery of live electronics. Visual and theatrical compositions Many of Applebaum's compositions are composed of visual and theatrical elements; pieces like Echolalia requires the rapid execution of 22 dadaist rituals.

It occurred at Cape Tres Forcas in Morocco, and was one of the first examples of Prussian or German gunboat diplomacy. The Treaty of Paris of 1856 had decided that a Prussian warship should be deployed to the River Danube's outlet into the Black Sea and, on its way there, Prince Adalbert decided to explore the Rif coast of Morocco. There, four years earlier, on 7 December 1852, the Prussian warship Flora had been shot at by pirates, with one sailor killed and its captain injured. On 7 August 1856 Prince Adalbert manned two boats and deployed them along the coast. After the boats came under fire from the Riffians, the Danzig moved to only 600 metres from the shore to give the boat crews supporting fire. Adalbert then ordered a landing operation by 14 officers and 53 non commissioned officers, sailors and marines, led by Adalbert in person. Around noon, he led a surprise attack on a steep rock face nearly 40 metres high under heavy enemy fire. This attack was successful and the Riffians were forced back to a plateau. However, they were also receiving continuous reinforcements and so Adalbert finally decided to withdraw, in case he and his troops were cut off from the shore. Prussian casualties were seven dead and 22 wounded, including Adalbert, shot in the thigh. A subscription from the whole Prussian Navy raised a monument to the dead of the battle in Gibraltar in the form of an eagle, set up in 1863. Despite being a complete tactical failure, the landing and Adalbert and his sailors' courage were praised for decades to come by the Prussian people and particularly within the Prussian and German Imperial navies.

He was born in his father’s house (former mayor Sa'id al- Shawa) in the al-Turukman section of the Shuja'iyya neighborhood. His mother, Hafiza Sha’ath from Beersheba, came from a major tribe in that area. Her brother, Tajuddin Sha'ath, was the head of the tribe and a former mayor of Beersheba.  Biography  Rushdi was sent to Istanbul in 1899 for education. He studied law and finished in 1914. He came to Gaza for the summer and was supposed to return to Istanbul in September–October for his official graduation, but was unable to as the University of Istanbul was destroyed during World War I. To get a degree, Rushdi instead went to Damascus, enrolled in the Syrian University (now the University of Damascus) and graduated in one year. In 1925, he returned to Palestine which was under British control and took up residence in the city of Jaffa. During his time as mayor of Gaza, Rushdi started rebuilding the infrastructure of the city. He started building asphalt roads, dug Bir as-Safa (as-Safa water well)—the first water well equipped with a pump and engine in Gaza—and started distributing water to houses through a water pipe system. He also started the first sewage draining system and provided electricity as well as many other services for the citizens of Gaza. He built the as-Shuja'iyya School, az-Zaytoon School, Salahuddin School, and was the head of the founding committee that built the Palestine High School.:: بلدية غزة ::. Municipality of Gaza. When the British Mandate over Palestine ended on May 15, 1948, Rushdi and along with other Arab mayors in Palestine were awarded the Order of the British Empire Medallion (OBE) by King George VI. Rushdi was elected mayor of Gaza more than once, serving for four terms. When British troops left Palestine on May 15, Rushdi was the last mayor elected for Gaza. Since 1946 no elections have been held for the municipality of Gaza. Rushdi flew the flag of Palestine over the municipal headquarters (as-Saraya) in Gaza upon the departure of the last British soldier from the city that same day. The newly appointed mayor of Gaza, Rushdi al-Shawwa, speaking at the inauguration ceremony of the Gaza municipal council, 26 November 1956 After Rushdi’s term ended in 1951, the Egyptian authority did not run any elections for the Municipality of Gaza. They started appointing mayors and members of the council. When Israel occupied the Gaza Strip in 1956, Rushdi accepted the responsibility of the Municipality of Gaza and helped saving the people’s lives, secured food, security, and other needs of Gaza City's residents and the inhabitants of the Gaza Strip as well. His term as mayor ended on March 7, 1957. Rushdi died in London on December 5, 1965 and his body transferred to Gaza on a United Nations aircraft via Beirut. In Gaza, a formal and national funeral for was held for him on December 9, 1965.

She is most notable for her role in the Battle of Tres Forcas in 1856. She was later decommissioned from the Prussian Navy and served in the navy of the Japanese Tokugawa shogunate as the from 1864 until 1869, and then briefly with the breakaway Ezo Republic until her destruction later the same year. Construction Danzigs design was conceived by the British engineer John Scott Russell and it was originally planned to build her in the United Kingdom. However, Prince Adalbert of Prussia (1811–1873) decided to build the vessel in Danzig instead to stimulate the local economy. The keel was laid at JW Klawitter's works there on 24 August 1850, with the copper mined near Berlin, the wood for the hull coming from the outskirts of Danzig and the iron imported from England. She entered service in June 1853. Career =First voyage= Danzigs first voyage was on 12 July 1853 to pick up her armament of ten 68-pounder guns from Deptford.Günter Stavorius, Peter P.E. Günther (Hrsg.). Tagebuch an Bord Sr. Majestät Dampf-Korvette \\"Danzig\\" auf der Reise von Danzig nach London, Konstantinopel, Athen, Syra 1853/54. Geführt von Eduard Arendt, Leutnant zur See 2. Klasse, Berlin und Trappenkamp 1998, Selbstverlag, o. ISBN The guns had to be picked up directly, since they could not be exported due to the demands of the Crimean War). She had a crew of 220 officers and men. Because of the 1853 conflict between the Ottoman and Russian empires, the vessel was then sent to Constantinople in September of that year, together with other Prussian units, to protect Prussian interests. From April to June 1854, the ship was in Piraeus to protect Otto of Greece (a member of the House of Wittelsbach), because he was threatened by a revolution. After this, the ship sailed to Syros to pick up a load of marble for Berlin Museums. =Battle of Tres Forcas= In the spring of 1856, a squadron under the leadership of Prince Adalbert, including the Danzig as flagship, the Thetis, the Amazone, the Mercur and the Frauenlob, sailed in the Atlantic Ocean to practise. As Danzig was the only ship with an engine, she had to tow the other vessels in case of no wind ('). At the invitation of Napoleon III, she visited Cherbourg. Due to differences between Prince Adalbert and the ship's commander, Wilhelm von Hessen-Philippsthal-Barchfeld, the prince dismissed the commander until reaching Gibraltar. In the meantime, the ship was commanded by Artur von Bothwell. Prince Adalbert planned a punitive expedition against Riffian pirates, who had in 1852 attacked the brig Flora. This expedition lead to the battle of Tres Forcas, which failed both on military as political terms, resulting in the death of seven crew members as well as 22 wounded, including the then 16-year old (later Admiral) Eduard von Knorr. The battle is considered to be one of the first examples of German gunboat diplomacy. After the battle, the ship sailed to Syra, where antique coffins where loaded for Berlin Museums. On 20 November 1856, she returned to Danzig, where she would be decommissioned. =Decommissioning= Due to severe dry rot damage to the hull, the navy considered replacing Danzigs wooden hull with iron, but this plan was ultimately scratched on cost grounds. She was therefore only occasionally in service from 1859 to 1860 and was finally struck from the navy list on 1 September 1862, especially since paddle steamers like her were now technically obsolete compared to steam screw. She was sold to the English firm Dorset and Blythe for 56,000 taler. =Service with Japanese forces= Now renamed the Eagle, the ship sailed to England in 1864, where she was bought later the same year by the Tokugawa shogunate, which renamed her as the Kaiten. She was armed with 13 cannons, and during the Boshin War was operated by forces loyal to the shōgun. She was the key actor in the Naval Battle of Miyako Bay, in which, after a failed attempt to board and overtake the , she was forced to flee ahead of the Imperial Japanese Navy. She was then the flagship of the Ezo navy during the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay. Later in the war, Kaiten was beached at Aomori Bay near Hakodate on 6 May 1869 and burned by her crew on 20 June the same year to prevent her falling into enemy hands – the Prussian corvette happened to be present and observed the burning. In the late Meiji Era, Arai Ikunosuke, once the Navy Minister of the Republic of Ezo, wrote an extensive article on the Kaiten in the historical journal \\"Kyū Bakufu\\".

A friend of Lord Chancellor Bacon, Altham opposed Coke but advanced the laws of equity behind the fastness of the Exchequer courts, so long considered almost inferior. Through advanced Jacobean royalism he helped to prosecute the King's enemies and centralise royal power of taxation. Early life Altham was descended from Christopher Altham of Girlington, in the West Riding of Yorkshire. He was the third son of James Altham of Mark Hall, Latton, in Essex, Sheriff of London in 1557–58, and sheriff of Essex in 1570, by Elizabeth Blancke, daughter of Thomas Blancke of London, Haberdasher, and sister of Sir Thomas Blanke, who was Lord Mayor of London in 1583. The Blanke family lived at the historic site of Abbot Waltham's house in the London parish of St.Mary-at-Hill. Altham was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, entered Gray's Inn in 1575 and was called to the bar in 1581. He is mentioned in Croke's reports for the first time as arguing a case in the Queen's Bench in 1587. Shortly before he entered the Commons, he was made an Ancient of Gray's Inn, granting superior status over juniors at the all- important dinners. In 1589, he was elected M.P. for Bramber in Sussex.For some unknown reason there are no surviving records of Altham's activities during the sessions. All that has come down is his drafting of seven bills for the Parliament of 1601, during which Robert Cecil, Earl of Salisbury passed some of the most significant social laws of the period. Legal career He was appointed reader at Gray's Inn in 1600, and in 1603 double reader (duplex lector). In the same year he was made serjeant-at-law. On 1 February 1607 he was appointed one of the barons of the exchequer, in succession to Sir John Savile, and knighted. In 1610, a question having arisen concerning the power of the crown to impose restrictions on trade and industry by proclamation, the two chief justices, the chief baron, and Baron Altham were appointed to consider the matter. The result of their consultation was that they unanimously resolved \\"that the king by his proclamation cannot create any offence which was not an offence before ... That the king hath no prerogative but that which the law of the land allows him ... and lastly, that if an offence be not punishable in the Star Chamber, the prohibition of it by proclamation cannot make it punishable there.\\"’ Altham was one of the judges whose opinion was taken in 1611 by Lord Chancellor Ellesmere on the case of the heretics Bartholomew Legate and Edward Wightman, whom Archbishop Abbot wanted burned. Altham was reputed hostile to Edward Coke, who was deliberately not consulted. The two men were burned, one at Smithfield, the other at Burton-upon-Trent. Altham's signature, together with those of the other twelve judges, is appended to the letter to the king relative to his action in the commendam case, in which the power of the crown to stay proceedings in the courts of justice in matters affecting its prerogative is denied. A serjeant- at-law, in arguing a case involving the right of the crown to grant commendams, i.e. licences to hold benefices that otherwise would be vacated, had in the performance of his duty disputed, first, the existence of any such prerogative except in cases of necessity; secondly, the possibility of any such case arising. The thereupon wrote by his attorney-general, Francis Bacon, a letter addressed to Lord Coke requiring that all proceedings in the cause should be stayed. This letter having been communicated to the judges, they assembled, and after consultation the letter already mentioned was sent to the king. The king replied by convening a council and summoning the judges to attend thereat. They attended, and, having been admonished by the king and the attorney-general, all, with the exception of Coke, fell upon their knees, acknowledged their error, and promised amendment. Altham died on 21 February 1617, and the lord keeper, Sir Francis Bacon, in appointing his successor, characterised the late baron as \\"one of the gravest and most reverend of the judges of this kingdom.\\" He was buried in Oxhey Chapel, built by himself on his estate at Oxhey in Hertfordshire, where a monument still preserves his memory and that of his third wife, who died on 21 April 1638. Family life By his first wife, Margaret, daughter of Oliver Skinner, Altham had issue one child only, a son James, afterwards Sir James Altham of Oxhey, knight. This Sir James Altham married Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Richard Sutton of London, and had issue a boy, who died in infancy, and two daughters, Elizabeth and Frances. Elizabeth Altham married Arthur Annesley, 1st Earl of Anglesey, second Viscount Valentia and first Earl of Anglesey, whose second son, Altham Annesley, was created in 1680 Baron Altham of Altham, with limitation in default of male issue to his younger brothers. His only son dying in infancy, the title devolved upon the younger branch of the Annesley family, who subsequently succeeded to the earldom of Anglesey. The earldom lapsed in 1771, when the English House of Lords decided against the legitimacy of the last claimant. Frances, the second daughter of Sir James Altham of Oxhey, married Richard Vaughan, 2nd Earl of Carbery. The title lapsed in 1713. By his second wife, Mary, daughter of Richard Stapers, Esq., Altham had three children, a son Richard, who died without issue; two daughters, Elizabeth and Mary. Elizabeth married first Sir Francis Astley of Hill Morton and Melton, knight, then Robert Digby, 1st Baron Digby (c. 1599–1642) (Irish peerage), and lastly Sir Robert Bernard, 1st Baronet, serjeant-at-law. Mary married Sir Francis Stydolph (d. 1655) and was the mother of Sir Richard Stydolph, Baronet. \\"Complete Baronetage: English, Scottish, and Irish, 1649–1664\\" By his third wife, Helen Saunderson, Altham had no children. Robert Altham, currently a circuit judge is one of his descendants.

Named for the city of Danzig (now Gdańsk, Poland), she was the seventh and last ship of the . She was begun by the Imperial Dockyard in her namesake city in 1904, launched on 23 September 1905 and commissioned on 1 December 1907. Armed with a main battery of ten guns and two torpedo tubes, Danzig was capable of a top speed of . Danzig spent the first ten years of her career in the reconnaissance forces of the High Seas Fleet. The ship saw extensive service during the First World War; she was present at the Battle of Heligoland Bight in August 1914, but did not engage British warships. She also saw action in the Baltic Sea against Russian forces, and was badly damaged by a Russian mine in November 1915. Danzig was also involved in Operation Albion, the seizure of the islands at the entrance of the Gulf of Riga, in September 1917. She was thereafter withdrawn from service, and surrendered to Britain after the end of the war as a war prize. Danzig was dismantled for scrap starting in 1921. Design The German 1898 Naval Law called for the replacement of the fleet's older cruising vessels—steam corvettes, unprotected cruisers, and avisos—with modern light cruisers. The first tranche of vessels to fulfill this requirement, the , were designed to serve both as fleet scouts and as station ships in Germany's colonial empire. They provided the basis for subsequent designs, beginning with the that was designed in 1901–1903. The principle improvements consisted of a larger hull that allowed for an additional pair of boilers and a higher top speed. Danzig was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of forward. She displaced as designed and up to at full load. Her propulsion system consisted of two triple-expansion steam engines with steam provided by ten coal-fired Marine-type water-tube boilers. Her propulsion system was rated at for a top speed of . Danzig carried up to of coal, which gave her a range of at . She had a crew of 14 officers and 274-287 enlisted men. The ship was armed with ten SK L/40 guns in single mounts. Two were placed side by side forward on the forecastle, six were located amidships, three on either side, and two were placed side by side aft. The guns could engage targets out to . They were supplied with 1,500 rounds of ammunition, for 150 shells per gun. For defense against torpedo boats, she carried ten Maxim guns in individual mounts. She was also equipped with two torpedo tubes with five torpedoes. They were submerged in the hull on the broadside. Danzig was also fitted to carry fifty naval mines. The ship was protected by an armored deck that was up to thick. The conning tower had thick sides, and the guns were protected by thick gun shields. Service history Danzig was ordered under the contract name Ersatz and was laid down at the Imperial Dockyard in Danzig in 1904 and launched on 23 September 1905, after which fitting-out work commenced. She was commissioned into the High Seas Fleet on 1 December 1907. After her commissioning, Danzig served in the reconnaissance forces of the High Seas Fleet. In 1910, she was used as a training ship for the fleet's gunners. She returned to fleet service in August 1914 after the outbreak of World War I. She was moored in Brunsbüttel with her sister-ship , en route to Kiel via the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal on the morning of 28 August 1914, when the British attacked the German patrol line in the Heligoland Bight. During the ensuing Battle of Heligoland Bight, Danzig and München were recalled and ordered to steam to the mouth of the Elbe and wait for further orders. Danzig reached the stricken cruiser shortly before 15:00 and lowered boats to rescue survivors. Konteradmiral Franz von Hipper, the commander of the I Scouting Group, issued an order for all cruisers to regroup on the approaching battlecruisers and , but Fregattenkapitän Reiß, Danzigs commander, refused, replying that he was \\"Rescuing people from Ariadne.\\" Danzig during Operation Albion On 7 May 1915, the IV Scouting Group, which by then consisted of Danzig, München, , and , and twenty-one torpedo boats was sent into the Baltic Sea to support a major operation against Russian positions at Libau. The operation was commanded by Rear Admiral Hopman, the commander of the reconnaissance forces in the Baltic. The IV Scouting Group was tasked with screening to the north to prevent any Russian naval forces from moving out of the Gulf of Finland undetected, while several armored cruisers and other warships bombarded the port. The Russians did attempt to intervene with a force of four cruisers: , , , and . The Russian ships briefly engaged München, but both sides were unsure of the others' strength, and so both disengaged. Shortly after the bombardment, Libau was captured by the advancing German army, and Stettin and the rest of the IV Scouting Group were recalled to the High Seas Fleet. On 8 May, Danzig joined the old pre-dreadnought battleships of the IV Battle Squadron on a reconnaissance toward Gotland; the operation lasted until 10 May, but encountered no Russian forces. Danzig ran into a Russian minefield on the evening of 25 November 1915, and was badly damaged by one of the mines. She was towed back to port, however, and repaired. In early September 1917, following the German conquest of the Russian port of Riga, the German navy decided to eliminate the Russian naval forces that still held the Gulf of Riga. The Admiralstab (the Navy High Command) planned an operation to seize the Baltic island of Ösel, and specifically the Russian gun batteries on the Sworbe Peninsula. On 18 September, the order was issued for a joint operation with the army to capture Ösel and Moon Islands; the primary naval component was to comprise the flagship, Moltke, along with the III and IV Battle Squadrons of the High Seas Fleet. The invasion force amounted to approximately 24,600 officers and enlisted men. Danzig had by this time been transferred to the II Scouting Group, which was tasked with screening for the invasion force. During the operation, Prince Adalbert, Kaiser Wilhelm II's son, was the ship's commander. Danzigs only significant action during the operation came on the 19th, when she and and were sent to intercept two Russian torpedo boats reported to be in the area. The Germans could not locate the vessels, and broke off the operation. Danzig was withdrawn from active service in late 1917. She survived the end of the war, and was stricken from the naval register on 5 November 1919. The ship was surrendered to the United Kingdom as the war prize R on 15 September 1920, and broken up for scrap in Whitby in 1921-1922\\\\.

Life She was the twelfth child (and sixth daughter) of Frederick V, Landgrave of Hesse-Homburg and Caroline of Hesse-Darmstadt, thus being a granddaughter of Countess Palatine Caroline of Zweibrücken, known as the \\"great Landgräfin\\". Maria Anna belonged to the anti-Napoleon-party around Queen Luise and supported the war against France in 1806. She followed the royal house in its escape from the French occupation. After the death of Queen Luise in 1810, she acted as first lady in official occasions. In March 1813, she proclaimed the famous \\"Aufruf der königlichen Prinzessinnen an die Frauen im preußischen Staate\\" and founded the patriotic women's association \\"Vaterländischen Frauenverein.\\" She corresponded with Freiherr vom Stein, von Hardenberg and the Humboldt brothers and was an acquaintance of the poet Friedrich de la Motte Fouqué.

The route that was operated extended from San Francisco, California to Los Angeles, then across the Colorado Desert to Fort Yuma, then across New Mexico Territory via, Tucson and Mesilla, New Mexico to Franklin, Texas, midpoint on the route. The route through Texas followed first the northern route to the Pecos River and downstream to Horse Head Crossing. The route in West Texas was changed in 1859, in order to secure a better water supply on the route and to provide mail service to a more settled area, the stages between Franklin and the Pecos River followed the San Antonio-El Paso Road to Camp Stockton and then turned east to Horsehead Crossing. From Horsehead Crossing the route crossed Texas to the Red River and into Indian Territory. In 1860 the route was changed to another route from Jacksboro to Sherman via Decatur due to the building of a new toll bridge at Bridgeport, that avoided delays crossing the West Fork of the Trinity River when it was flooded. From Colberts Ferry the route went on to Fort Smith, then up across Arkansas and southwest Missouri to Tipton with the final leg by train to St. Louis. The Texas mail route was so long that the route there, like that in California, was divided into two divisions each under a superintendent. 5th Division Route At first the 5th Division route left Franklin to run due east thirty miles to Hueco Tanks, thirty six miles to Cornudas de Los Alamos then east northeast fifty-six miles to Pinery Station. Subsequently, stations were added between Hueco Tanks and Cornudas de Los Alamos at Ojos de los Alamos, and at Crow Springs between Cornudas de Los Alamos and Pinery. From Pinery, the route then ran twenty-four miles east to Delaware Springs Station, then forty miles down Delaware Creek nearly to its junction with the Pecos River, and across Pope's Crossing to Pope's Camp. It then ran sixty five miles down the east bank of the Pecos, to Emigrant Crossing Station and onward fifty-five miles to Horsehead Crossing. Sections of this route, including Pinery Station, are preserved as part of Guadalupe Mountains National Park, and have been listed on the National Register of Historic Places. From Horsehead Crossing the trail ran seventy waterless miles east northeast across the Llano Estacado to the headwaters of the Middle Concho River, then northward, about thirty miles through the vicinity of modern Carlsbad, to a camp or station;, then twenty-two miles to Grape Creek Station near the south line of present Coke County; to Fort Chadbourne in what is now Coke County. In August 1859, the route in West Texas was changed from the upper route in order to secure a better water supply on the route, with more security from the Army and to provide mail service to a more settled area, by using the San Antonio-El Paso Road from Franklin to Camp Stockton before cutting across to link up with the rest of the route at Horsehead Crossing. This entailed abandoning the investment in the well constructed stations on the old route, and building some on the new route. Although this was mitigated when an arraignment was made to use the stations of George H. Giddings' San Antonio-El Paso Mail along that route. Losses from this change and debt taken on from a delay of postal revenue, eventually led the investors in the Overland Mail Company to take control and dismiss John Warren Butterfield in 1860. The stages between Franklin and the Pecos River now would follow the San Antonio-El Paso Road down the Rio Grande, 14 miles from Franklin to Ysleta, then passing 12 miles through Socorro to San Elizario, then on 10 miles to Camp Hawkins Station, 24 miles to Birchville Station, 15 miles to Camp Rice Station, then 18 miles to Fort Quitman. Moving eastward away from the river at Fargo Station 5 miles below Fort Quitman, the route traveled 25 miles to Eagle Spring, 19 miles to Van Horns Wells, then a waterless 33 miles to Deadman's Hole, 18 miles to Barrel Springs, another 18 miles to Fort Davis. From Fort Davis Station the route proceeded down through Limpia Canyon to Limpia Station, Barrilla Springs, then 34 miles to Leon Springs and 8 miles on to Camp Stockton. 11 miles east of Camp Stockton the route reached Camp Pleasant then crossed the plain 23 miles to Horsehead Crossing where a ferry carried the coaches across the Pecos River to Horsehead Crossing Station. 6th Division Route The 6th Division route ran from Fort Chadbourne, twelve miles to the north across Valley Creek to Station #1 then sixteen miles to Mountain Pass Station, then thirty miles, past the route of the Texas and Pacific Railway, a mile west of the site of present Tye, to Fort Phantom Hill, then twelve miles more to Smith's Station, twenty six miles to Clear Fork station, thirteen miles to Franz's Station and then twenty-two miles to Fort Belknap. From Fort Belknap the line turned eastward sixteen miles to Murphy's Station (near present Graham, Texas), then nineteen miles to Jacksboro, Texas, sixteen miles to Earhart's Station, twenty-four miles to Davidson's Station, then seventeen miles to Gainesville, Texas, fifteen miles to Diamond's station (one mile west of the site of present Whitesboro), fifteen miles to Sherman and across the Red River at Colbert's Ferry, eight miles below Preston, Texas to Indian Territory.

He was born under Europe's Ancien Regime but lived to see the Age of Enlightenment, the French Revolution, the fall of the Holy Roman Empire, the rise and fall of Napoleon I, the Congress of Vienna and its establishment of a new geopolitical order in Europe and Germany. Unlike his predecessors and successors, he was not keen on war and instead became one of the patrons of German Geistesgeschichte, corresponding with Lavater and Klopstock and visiting Voltaire, D’Alembert and Albrecht von Haller. He was caustic, conservative but popular with his people. Life =Regency and accession= He was born in 1748, the only son of Frederick IV, Landgrave of Hesse-Homburg and Princess Ulrike Louise of Solms- Braunfels (1731–1792), daughter of Frederick William, Prince of Solms- Braunfels. His father died when he was only three and he succeeded to the landgraviate - Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor allowed his mother to become his regent, despite opposition from Louis VIII, Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt, who had occupied Hesse-Homburg in 1747. Councillor Friedrich Karl Kasimir von Creutz fought on Frederick's behalf and was even imprisoned for 18 months, leading to the case being tried before the Reichshofrat and Francis himself. Finally in 1756 Louis was ordered out of Hesse-Homburg. On 22 March 1766 he reached majority early thanks to von Creutz's efforts and began ruling the landgraviate. He ended the dispute with Hesse-Darmstadt via a treaty in which Hesse-Darmstadt renounced all claims to Hesse-Homburg but still represented it on the Reichstag and Kreistag rather than Hesse-Homburg directly representing itself. Barbara Dölemeyer: Von der Landgrafschaft Hessen-Homburg zur Nebenresidenz der Hohenzollern. In: Bernd Heidenreich, Eckhard G. Franz (ed.s), Kronen, Kriege, Künste. Das Haus Hessen im 19. und 20. Jahrhundert. Frankfurt: Societaetsverlag, 2009, , S. 57 f. This new status quo was cemented on 27 September 1768 by Frederick's dynastic and diplomatic marriage to Caroline of Hesse-Darmstadt, the Francophile daughter of Louis IX, Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt and Countess Palatine Caroline of Zweibrücken. It was not a love match - in his old age he wrote in his memoirs that he was yet to know love, as is also evidenced by his long absences and by remarks in letters written about him by noble families in the landgraviate. =Education= During his minority Frederick had been educated by his pious Calvinist, Pietist and humanist tutor Alexander von Sinclair (father of the future diplomat Isaac von Sinclair). He was criticised for over-educating Frederick but answered \\"Is he called to be a huntsman or one of the high-born wastrels with whom Germany is teeming? Should he spend his time gaming, hunting and walking or will he instead need to read the reports and expert opinions of his councillors and make decisions about them?\\" Fried Lübbecke: Kleines Vaterland Homburg vor der Höhe. Kramer, Frankfurt am Main 1981, S. 12. Sinclair's strict education can be almost wholly reconstructed, using court records and reports to his mother, who showed no interest in her son's education. It formed the foundation for his later convictions that piety and self-knowledge were the routes to salvation. Frederick stammered, impeding his education in public speaking, but Sinclair taught him philosophy, maths, architecture, chess and pianoforte. A military career was out of the question, however, since Frederick was too dynastically valuable to risk his life. In line with Sinclair's Calvinist-Pietist ideals, Frederick managed the state finances as honestly as he could, though he often had to ask for loans from bankers in Amsterdam or Frankfurt. He did not manage to correct the major financial mismanagement he had inherited, despite efforts by specialists such as Friedrich Karl von Moser. Even as late as 1780 his administration was unable to draw up a list of all debts, receipts and expenditure and Frederick's intent to put all decrees in writing seemed impossible - the mismanagement was handed on to Frederick's successor. Ursula Brauer, Alexander Adam von Sinclaire, Die Erziehungsakten für Friedrich V. Ludwig von Hessen-Homburg. Gutachten und Berichte über eine Fürstenerziehung – Fragmente eines Fürstenspiegels (1752–1766), in: Mitteilungen des Vereins für Geschichte und Landeskunde zu Bad Homburg vor der Höhe, Band 42 (1993), 27–92. =Arts and Freemasonry= Scholars, poets and musicians were always welcome at Frederick's court. Johann Wolfgang von Goethe stayed there, falling in love there and mentioning the White Tower in his \\"Pilgrim's Morning Song\\". Two of Frederick's main concerns were his library and the state's school system - he even continued to buy books when he was behind on salary payments to court officials. Caroline enjoyed French works, but Frederick preferred non-fiction, collecting works on philosophy, history, military science and theology. A passionate traveler and travel writer, he also collected other people's travel writings. Brauer writes that he \\"generally liked to write philosophical- political-religious treatises. It seemed to him that the best enlightenment that could be taught in schools was that Christianity was God's will divinely revealed and that life in heaven was the ultimate aim of life on earth - he also felt it best to limit the number of literate people, secondary schools and universities\\". Ursula Brauer, Landgraf Friedrich V. Ludwig von Hessen- Homburg und sein republikanischer Freund Franz Wilhelm Jung, in: Aus dem Stadtarchiv, Vorträge zur Bad Homburger Geschichte 1991/92, 7–35 Despite his piety, he was a strong backer of the Société Patriotique de Hesse-Hombourg, a short-lived project to centre for coordinating Enlightenment ideas from across the whole of Europe, granting it financial support. On 27 August 1782 he was admitted as a freemason by Prince Charles of Hesse-Kassel just outside the Wilhelmsbader Konvent in the presence of Frederick II, Landgrave of Hesse- Kassel and Prince Christian of Hesse-Darmstadt. He is said to have failed to keep his promise to seek out a lodge, he reached the fifth grade (Ecuyer) of the Rectified Scottish Rite. Todenopfer. Ihrem am 20.

Loge Friederich zum Nordstern im Aufgange zu Homburg vor der Höhe am 2ten Februar 1820. S. 30/31 This informed his encounters with Goethe and Klopstock, who were also Freemasons. The foundation of the \\"Friedrich zum Nordstern\\" lodge in Homburg in 1817 would have been inconceivable without his protection and attention - it outlived him, lasting until it was shut down by his anti- Masonic successor Frederick VI. In 1802 Alexander von Sinclair's son Isaac asked Frederick for a permanent position as court librarian for his old friend Friedrich Hölderlin, who had fallen into melancholy after professional setbacks and the death of his mistress. Frederick had known Hölderlin since 1798 and Frederick agreed, on condition that Sinclair pay Hölderlin's salary himself. Hölderlin took up the post in June 1804 but since Frederick himself assisted in the library, he had little to do. He dedicated his poem Patmos to Frederick, which may also have been a commission from Sinclair - Frederick had initially hope that Klopstock would write him such a hymn. =Occupation and restoration= Sarcophagus of Frederick V in the landgraviate's vault. He once nicknamed himself \\"Frederick the Hermit\\" but even he could not wholly ignore the outside world, especially when in 1795 a French Revolutionary army under Jean-Baptiste Jourdan broke through into the Rhein-Main-Gebiet. From then on Homburg was under almost constant military occupation and the state had to pay contributions to France. Generals Laurent de Gouvion Saint-Cyr and Michel Ney even moved their headquarters into Bad Homburg Castle in 1798, ejecting Frederick and his family to private lodgings in then-neutral Prussia (his six adult sons were already on military service). When Francis II dissolved the Holy Roman Empire, Frederick refused to join the Confederation of the Rhine and so in 1806 Hesse-Homburg was annexed to Hesse-Darmstadt as part of the German mediatization, despite Frederick's pleas to Napoleon himself. Its administration was relocated to Gießen and Frederick retreated to landscaping his \\"Tempe\\" gardens at the foot of the Taunus, seeking a cure in the Schlangenbad baths and staying in a suite of rooms at the 'Stadt Ulm' hotel in Frankfurt am Main. After the fall of Napoleon, Hesse-Homburg was one of a few mediatised states which regained their former status, even winning total independence from Hesse-Darmstadt for the first time. This was thanks to his youngest daughter Marianne (who had married into the Prussian royal family in 1810), his six sons' military service with Prussia and his (albeit minor) family connection to the House of Hesse. This was confirmed via the German Confederation Constitution of 1815, which gave Frederick back his original lands and even added the 176 km² Grand Bailiwick of Meisenheim on the west bank of the Rhine, taken from the French department of Sarre. He had hoped for better (including an increase to neighbouring Rosbach vor der Höhe and Oberusel) and complained \\"What should I do with this district in China?\\".Günther F. Anthes, Hessen-Homburg und Meisenheim. In: Mitteilungen des Vereins für Geschichte und Landeskunde zu Bad Homburg vor der Höhe, Band 35 (1982). Zur 1200-Jahrfeier herausgegeben im Auftrag der Stadt Bad Homburg However, Hesse-Homburg was now a sovereign state again, joining the German Confederation as its smallest state on 7 July 1817. In 1818 his eldest son married into the British royal family by his union with George III's daughter Elizabeth. In 1819 Frederick established the Schwerterkreuz medal for military service in Hesse-Homburg's armies (now rare as it was only awarded sixteen times) and the following year he died in the castle at Bad Homburg.

On May 17, 2007, after the signing of the Act of Canonical Communion between the ROCOR and the Russian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate), Kapral became a part of the episcopate of the latter. Biography The youngest child of Alexei and Euphrosynia Kapral, Igor Kapral was born on 6 January 1948 in Spirit River, Alberta, Canada. He spent a childhood he describes as \\"pleasant ... absolutely free of any harmful influences\\", walking two and a half miles to school each day. (Later, Kapral transferred to a school in Blueberry Creek, but he returned to finish high school.) Patriarch Kirill in Moscow, September 30, 2010 From his youth, Kapral felt drawn to the Church and loved to read books and periodicals on religion and morals. From a young age, around 6 or 7, he knew that he wanted to become a priest. He attended Holy Trinity Church in Spirit River, a congregation of the ROCOR composed of ethnic Ukrainians. Services were held monthly or bi-monthly, and often Archbishop Panteleimon (Rudyk) would celebrate these services. Igor revered Archbishop Panteleimon, who told the boy, \\"someday you will be a priest\\". In 1966, Kapral found a spiritual guide: Right Reverend Sava (Saračević), Bishop of Edmonton, a Serb who greatly revered John of Shanghai and San Francisco. In 1967, Kapral entered Holy Trinity Orthodox Seminary in Jordanville, New York. While there, he learned the Russian language, sang on the kliros, and served in the altar, learning the order of divine services. From his second year at seminary, Kapral was tasked with typesetting \\"Orthodox Life\\" in English, under the editorship of archimandrite Constantine Zaitsev; Igor soon succeeded him as editor. After some time, hieromonk Ignatius (Trepatschko), who was in charge of printing the journal, asked Kapral to typeset it in Russian as well. Upon graduation from the seminary in 1972, Kapral entered the Holy Trinity Monastery as a novice. On 2 December 1974, he was tonsured a rassophore monk with the name Hilarion, in honor of Venerable Schema-monk Hilarion of the Kiev Caves and subsequently was tonsured into the little schema. On 4 December 1975, Archbishop Averky Taushev, for whom Hilarion served as a cell-attendant, ordained him a hierodeacon and on Lazarus Saturday 1976 Bishop Laurus of Manhattan ordained him a hieromonk. Hilarion served as a hieromonk at the monastery, continuing his work at the printing press. He was often sent to parishes, replacing absent priests, often traveling to Cleveland and Pennsylvania. presbyter by cheirotonia, 2010. On 10 December 1984, Hilarion was consecrated a bishop by Metropolitan of New York Philaret and nine other bishops and appointed to the see of Manhattan, charged with overseeing parishes in Pennsylvania; in the Synod of Bishops, Hilarion served as deputy secretary. In 1995, Bishop Hilarion was transferred to the See of Washington while retaining his residence in New York City. On 20 June 1996, he was transferred to the Diocese of Australia and New Zealand (which was experiencing problems at that stage) and raised to the rank of archbishop. In December 2003, Kapral was awarded the honour of wearing a diamond cross on his klobuk. Upon Metropolitan Laurus's death Archbishop Hilarion was appointed as the temporary head of the ROCOR Synod.

The wreck was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. History The Glenlyon (Canadian Official #126660; American #81427) was constructed in 1893 by F. W. Wheeler & Company as the William H. Gratwick for John Mitcell & Company of Cleveland, Ohio. The ship was a steel-hulled, steam-powered package freighter, 328 feet long with a beam of 42.5 feet, a depth of 20.5 feet, and a cargo capacity of 3800 tons. The ship had two decks and three masts. It was launched on February 4, 1893, and was the first ship to sport one of Wheeler's newly produced engines, a 1200-horsepower triple expansion steam engine. The Gratwick was sold multiple times: in 1899, 1902, 1907, and, in 1910 to the Chicago & Duluth Transportation Company. The ship hauled both package freight and bulk cargo, as well as, for a short time, passengers for both U.S. and Canada—an unusual history for a Great Lakes ship. In 1912, Chicago & Duluth renamed the ship Minnekahta. The ship was sold again in 1913, and finally, in 1914, the ship was purchased by the Great Lakes Transportation Company Ltd. of Midland, Ontario, overhauled, and had her name changed to the Glenyon. At the same time, the ship's registry was changed to be Canadian. On October 30, 1924, the Glenlyon left Thunder Bay, Ontario carrying 143,000 bushels of wheat. The weather turned particularly bad, and the ship was forced to anchor in the Welcome Islands. On the 31st, the captain decided to resume the trip, but the winds picked up again and the Glenlyon headed for shelter in Isle Royale's Siskiwit Bay. In the early morning hours of November 1, 1924 the ship ran aground on the reef now bearing its name off Menagerie Island and near the Isle Royale Light while steaming toward Siskiwit Bay. The ship sent out a distress call, and the captain turned off the pumps to keep the ship settled on the reef. Other vessels from the Great Lakes Transportation fleet rushed to the scene, as well as the Coast Guard, and most of the crew was rescued by late morning. Two crewmembers who had gone overboard in a lifeboat for an unknown reason were missing; a search was made for the men and they were found early the next morning ashore in Siskiwit Bay. Salvage operations were started, but only 75,000 bushels of cargo were recovered over the next few weeks. The ship's condition deteriorated, and eventually salvage operations were called off. The Glenlyon soon broke in half, and by April of the next year it was completely submerged. The wreck today Diving the wreck The cold waters of the lake have preserved the structure of the ship in 15 to 60 feet of water. The wreck of the Glenlyon is open to the public and accessible for dives, although it was visited less than 20 times in 2009 out of 1062 dives made to wrecks in the Isle Royale National Park. The wreckage of the ship is scattered, with the bow section on the bay side of the shoal and the stern section on the lake side. However, pieces of the wreck are easily recognizable, as they are laid out close to their origins on the ship, and nearly the entire ship is still in place. Some large sections of the ship are still intact, including the bow, and the engine room with drive shaft, propeller, engine, and boilers. The cabin is easily recognizable. The ship is significant as an example of a transitional style vessel, built as typical freighter lengths were rapidly increasing from 300 feet in 1886 to 400 feet in 1895. It is the only known example of this type and size of vessel available for study. The wreckage of the Glenlyon has been archeologically surveyed multiple times, giving a map of the wreckage, and particularly how parts of the wreckage moves across the lake floor due to currents and ice floes.

(1799–1872) was a Scottish theological writer and preacher. Life The grave of Rev William Anderson, Glasgow Necropolis Anderson was born on 6 January 1799, at Kilsyth, near Glasgow, where his father, Rev. John Anderson, was minister of a congregation of what was then called the Relief church, afterwards merged in the United Presbyterian. William Anderson became a minister in the same communion, having been ordained in 1822 pastor of the congregation in John Street, Glasgow, an office which he held till his death, though for some years he had retired from its more active duties. Very early in his career Dr. Anderson manifested an eccentricity which procured for him the sobriquet of ‘daft Willie Anderson.’ He showed much resolution in his early youth in insisting on his right to read his discourses in the pulpit from manuscript, and in his vindication of the use of the organ in public worship. As a preacher he was popular, but his powers were more forcibly displayed on public platforms. He was an uncompromising opponent of slavery, an enthusiastic supporter of oppressed nationalities, an eager advocate of political reforms in the interest of the people, and a cordial supporter of liberal measures generally. He was likewise a strenuous advocate for the separation of church and state. On one occasion in London, in pleading the anti-slavery cause, he appeared on the same platform with Daniel O'Connell, and made so favourable an impression that O'Connell and the audience urged him to continue his speech when the time allotted to him came to an end. Dr. Anderson was a great favourite with the community of Glasgow, and, in a sense, held a similar position to that of Dr. Chalmers before him, and that of Dr. Norman Macleod after him. He encouraged independence of thought and action, and had no was a strenuous opponent of the Church of Rome. He was a strong millennarian, and in early life had come under the influence of Edward Irving and Mr. Cunninghame of Lainshaw. Dr. Anderson published many pamphlets and several books. His larger productions were two volumes of sermons, a volume on Regeneration, one on the ‘Filial Honour of God,’ and two volumes on the Mass and Penance. His theological position was that of a moderate Calvinist. In social life his wide general knowledge, his humour, his store of anecdotes and memorable sayings, rendered him singularly attractive. He received an honorary doctorate (LLD) from the University of Glasgow in 1850. He died on 15 September 1872 and was buried in the Glasgow Necropolis. The distinctive grave (though lacking its bronze portrait medallion) stands towards the south-west of the upper section.

Built in 1868, it is the oldest Episcopal church still in use in Nevada. On January 3, 1978, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. History James W. Nye, one of the church's first vestrymen. On November 9, 1863, laymen D. S. King and A. H. Griswold were selected as the first wardens of the new parish in Carson City. Nevada territorial governor James W. Nye and businessman Henry Marvin Yerington were among the first vestrymen. The site for a new church building was acquired in 1865. The women of the congregation helped raise construction funds through social events, such as sales at fairs and other activities. =Construction= Building plans were announced in July 1867. The Corbett brothers built the exterior walls and shingled roof by October 27 of that year and completed the steeple on November 3, 1867. Construction work concluded in July 1868 at a cost of $5,500. The first sermon in the new building was delivered by Reverend George B. Allen on August 8, 1868. The first rector was William Maxwell Reilly. The church was consecrated by Bishop Ozi William Whitaker on June 19, 1870. Work to expand the church building by commenced in October 1873 and was completed in April 1874. A library was added in 1875. The stained glass window in front of the belfry, a gift from England, was shipped by sea around Cape Horn to San Francisco, from which it was delivered by wagon to Carson City. The original church bell became badly cracked by 1881, and was recast by the local machine shop of the Virginia and Truckee Railroad. A private residence to the south of the church as acquired for use as a rectory in 1891, at a cost of $3,500. That same year, the church purchased a pipe organ for $1,700. Other modernizations to the structure include the addition of a kitchen and plumbing as well as electrical lighting in 1919. =Continued use= The church struggled through a collapse of the state's mining industry in the late 19th century, as well as temporary closure in 1909. After recovering from a period as an \\"aided parish\\" from 1920 to 1957, the building has remained the oldest Episcopal church still in use in the state of Nevada. However, St. Paul's Episcopal Church, organized in September 1861 at Virginia City, Nevada, is the oldest parish in the state. The current minister of St. Peter's, the Reverend Jeff Paul, has been with the church since September 1995. Architecture The identity of the architect is uncertain, but architectural historians believe Henry Marvin Yerington was involved in the design of the church. The Gothic Revival building has been noted for its \\"architectural sophistication\\", with elements of Medieval and Classic origin, according to the Carson City Historical Commission. The interior resembles the upside-down hull of a ship. The pews are arranged in three groups of rows, making this the only Episcopal church west of the Mississippi River without a center aisle to the altar. The auditorium measures 70 feet following the 1874 expansion, which added a lecture and sunday school room in two respective wings. The chancel is supported by fluted Roman Corinthian columns. The wood-framed structure sits upon a low foundation made of sandstone ashlar. The steeple is a 1977 replica that was built to replace damage to the building from a fire. Notable members *James W.

The site also distributes information over Twitter, YouTube, and Flickr. Uriminzokkiri is currently blocked in South Korea. History In August 2010, Uriminzokkiri launched YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter accounts in an effort to improve North Korea's image around the world. Uriminzokkiri maintains an account on the Chinese video platform Youku, and has uploaded more than 14,000 videos. On 18 September 2012, Uriminzokkiri uploaded a video containing a photoshopped image of South Korea's president- elect Park Geun-hye performing the dance moves of \\"Gangnam Style\\". The video also mocks her as a devoted admirer of the Yushin system of autocratic rule set up by her father, Park Chung-hee. On 5 February 2013, a film that featured New York in flames was removed from YouTube after a DMCA complaint filed by Activision due to the use of footage from Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3. On 19 March 2013, a new North Korean propaganda video was posted on the Uriminzokkiri YouTube channel that presented images of an imagined missile attack on U.S. government buildings in Washington, D.C., including the White House and the Capitol. On 3 April 2013, hacker group Anonymous claimed it had stolen 15,000 user passwords as part of a cyberwar against the DPRK. Several hours later, Anonymous claimed responsibility for hacking into the Uriminzokkiri website and its Twitter and Flickr accounts. On 21 May 2013, Uriminzokkiri claimed that North Korea's threat to target Cheong Wa Dae (using unmanned aerial vehicles instead of surface-to-surface missiles) was intended to use \\"terrain features for cover\\". It also pointed out that the UAVs are capable of hitting Cheong Wa Dae in less than three minutes travelling at 925 km/h. The website further boasted that North Korean drones are also capable of attacking the Capital Defence Command on the southern side of Mount Kwanak in southern Seoul. South Korea's top brass ignored these imminent provocations, just as they did in 2010 before the sinking of the Navy corvette Cheonan. On 24 March 2014, weeks after Australian missionary John Short was deported from North Korea for \\"anti-state\\" religious acts, Uriminzokkiri released an article using biblical terms and references to describe the country as a utopian paradise. Titled \\"Korea is a human paradise in which Jesus would have nothing to do even if he came\\", the article portrays North Korea as a land with free healthcare, free education, and no taxes thanks to Kim Jong-un. The article claimed that its title is a direct quote from a famous American religious figure who visited North Korea but is not named throughout the article. In January 2017 the American internet platform YouTube terminated Uriminzokkiri's YouTube Channel, due to legal complaints without stating any further information. Etymology There does not seem to be any definitive translation of \\"Uriminzokkiri\\" into English. The Uriminzokkiri website itself proffers no English translation. The term can be broken down into uri, meaning \\"we\\", \\"our\\", or \\"collective self\\"; minjok, meaning \\"race\\", \\"people\\", \\"nation\\", or in this case simply \\"Koreans\\"; and kkiri, meaning \\"with\\", \\"between\\", \\"together\\", or \\"among\\", in some cases with an exclusionary nuance, presumably intended in this case to convey the notion that Korean issues are to be solved by the Koreans themselves and not third parties or superpowers. The translation \\"on our own as a nation\\" has been used by a major newspaper. A relatively literal translation would be \\"Our People (or Peoples) Together/As One\\", \\"Bringing Our Nation(s) Together\\", or \\"We the [Korean] People\\". Incorporating the exclusionary nuance of kkiri, and being less literal, might yield \\"Just Us Koreans\\".

She is considered to be the first Italian woman who had been raped to publicly refuse to marry her rapist. Instead, she and her family successfully appealed to the law to prosecute the rapist. The trial had a wide resonance in Italy, as Viola's behavior clashed with the traditional social conventions in Southern Italy, whereby a woman would lose her honour if she did not marry the man to whom she lost her virginity. Franca Viola thus became a symbol of the cultural progress and the emancipation of women in post-war Italy.Rifiuto il matrimonio dopo lo stupro(in Italian) Marta Boneschi, Di testa loro. Essay on ten women that changed the Italian culture in the 20th century (, in Italian)  Kidnapping and rape  Franca Viola was born in the rural town of Alcamo, Sicily, the oldest daughter of Bernardo Viola, a farmer, and his wife, Vita Ferra. In 1963, at the age of 15, she became engaged to Filippo Melodia, nephew of the mafia member Vincenzo Rimi, then aged 23. Melodia was subsequently arrested for theft, and Viola's father insisted she break off the engagement, which she did. Melodia then moved to Germany. By 1965 Viola was engaged to another man, and Melodia had returned to Alcamo and was trying unsuccessfully to re-enter Viola's life, stalking her and threatening both her father and boyfriend. In the early hours of 26 December 1965, Melodia and a group of 12 armed companions broke into the Viola home and kidnapped Franca by dragging her into a car, in the process beating up Viola's mother and also taking Franca's 8-year-old brother Mariano, who refused to let go of his sister. Mariano was released a few hours later, but Franca was held for 8 days in the home of Melodia's sister and her husband (a farmhouse on the outskirts of the town), where she was repeatedly raped. Melodia told her that now she would be forced to marry him so as not to become a \\"dishonoured\\" woman, but Viola replied that she had no intention of marriage and, moreover, that she would have him sued for kidnapping and rape. On 31 December, Melodia contacted Viola's father Bernardo for the piacata (Sicilian for 'appeasement', meaning appeasement between the families of the man and woman who 'eloped'). Bernardo pretended to negotiate with the kidnappers, saying he agreed and consented to the marriage, while collaborating with the Carabinieri police in preparing a successful dragnet operation. Viola was released and her kidnappers arrested on 2 January 1966, seven days before her eighteenth birthday. She said her father asked her if she really wanted to marry Melodia and, when she said she did not, he told her he would do everything possible to help her.  Refusal of a rehabilitating marriage  Melodia offered Viola a rehabilitating marriage, but she refused, thus acting against what was the common practice in the Sicilian society of the time. According to traditional social code, this choice would make her a donna svergognata, or \\"woman without honour\\" (literally: a \\"shameless woman\\"), as she had lost her virginity without getting married. These concepts were not exclusive to Sicily or rural areas; to some extent, they were also implicit in the Italian Penal Code of the time, namely Article 544, which equated rape to a crime against \\"public morality\\" rather than a personal offence, and formalized the idea of a \\"rehabilitating marriage\\" (matrimonio riparatore), stating that a rapist who married his victim would have his crime automatically extinguished.  Trial  After Viola refused to marry her rapist, her family members were reportedly menaced, ostracised and persecuted by most of the townspeople, including their vineyard and barn being burned to the ground. These events and the following trial had a wide resonance in the Italian media, and the Parliament itself was directly involved, as it became obvious that part of the existing code clashed with public opinion. Melodia's lawyers claimed Viola had consented to a so-called fuitina (elopement, a runaway to get married secretly) rather than being kidnapped, but the trial found Melodia guilty. He was sentenced to 11 years in prison, later reduced to 10 years, with a two-year period of compulsory residence in Modena. Five of his friends were acquitted, and the others received relatively mild sentences. Melodia was released from prison in 1976, and was killed in April 1978 in a mafia-style execution before he could return to Sicily. The article of law whereby a rapist could extinguish his crime by marrying his victim was not abolished until 1981.Niente di straordinario (in italian)legislature.camera.it (law no. 442 5 August 1981) Sexual violence became a crime against the person (instead of against \\"public morality\\") only in 1996.  Marriage of choice  Franca Viola married Giuseppe Ruisi in December 1968, when she was almost 21 years old. They had liked each other since childhood. Ruisi, an accountant, insisted he would have married the girl he had long loved despite threats and rumours, but had to request a firearm licence after obtaining the marriage licence, to protect himself and his future wife. Both the Italian President Giuseppe Saragat and Pope Paul VI publicly expressed their appreciation of Franca Viola's courage and their solidarity with the couple.1965, lo \\"strappo\\" di Franca Viola (in Italian) President Saragat sent the couple a gift on their wedding day, and the pope received them in a private audience soon after. Viola and Ruisi would go on to have three children (two sons and one daughter). Franca Viola still lives in Alcamo with her husband.  Legacy  In 1970, director Damiano Damiani made the film The Most Beautiful Wife, starring Ornella Muti, based on Viola's case. In 2012 the Sicilian writer Beatrice Monroy published Viola's story under the title Niente ci fu ('There was nothing'). In 2017, a fifteen-minute film based on Viola's story, titled Viola, Franca, was included as a finalist in the Manhattan Short Film Festival.

The term and concept were initially introduced by Professor Kecheng Liu during a keynote speech at the SOLI 2008 international conference.Liu, K. , Pervasive informatics in intelligent spaces for living and working, Keynote, IEEE international Conference on Service Operations and Logistics, and Informatics 2009, xviii –xix” The built environment is rich with information which can be utilised by its occupants to enhance the quality of their work and life. By introducing ICT systems, this information can be created, managed, distributed and consumed more effectively, leading to more advanced interactions between users and the environment. The social interactions in these spaces are of additional value, and Informatics can effectively capture the complexities of such information rich activities. Information literally pervades, or spreads throughout, these socio-technical systems, and pervasive informatics aims to study, and assist in the design of, pervasive information environments, or pervasive spaces, for the benefit of their stakeholders and users.  Pervasive computing  Pervasive informatics may be initially viewed as simply another branch of pervasive, or ubiquitous computing. However, pervasive informatics places a greater emphasis on the ICT-enhanced socio-technical pervasive spaces, as opposed to the technology driven direction of pervasive computing. This distinction between fields is analogous to that of informatics and computing, where Informatics focuses on the study of information, while the primary concern of computing is the processing of information. Pervasive informatics aims to analyse the pervasive nature of information, examining its various representations and transformations in pervasive spaces, which are enabled by pervasive computing technologies e.g. smart devices and intelligent control systems.  Pervasive spaces  A pervasive space is characterised by the physical and informational interaction between the occupants and the built environment e.g. the act of controlling the building is a physical interaction, while the space responding to this action/user instruction is an informational interaction. Intelligent pervasive spaces are those that display intelligent behaviour in the form of adaptation to user requirements or the environment itself. Such intelligent behaviour can be implemented using artificial intelligence algorithms and agent-based technologies. These intelligent spaces aim to provide communication and computing services to their occupants in such a way that the experience is almost transparent e.g. automated control of heating and ventilation based on occupant preference profiles. The term first appeared in an IBM Research Report Mcfaddin, S., D. Coffman et al., Celadon: Delivering Business Services to Mobile Users in Public Spaces, IBM Research Report, RC24381. but was not properly defined or discussed until later. An intelligent pervasive space is a “social and physical space with enhanced capability through ICT for human to interact with the built environments” An alternative definition is “an adaptable and dynamic area that optimises user services and management processes using information systems and networked ubiquitous technologies”.Moran, S. and Nakata, K. , Ubiquitous Monitoring and Behavioural Change: A Semiotic Perspective. 11th International Conference on Informatics and Semiotics in Organisations (ICISO). Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China: 449-456” A common point between these definitions is that pervasive computing technologies are the means by which intelligence and interactions are achieved in pervasive spaces, with the purpose of enhancing a users experience.  Theories and techniques  Historically, there have been few attempts to consolidate approaches to studying the complex interplay between occupants and the built environment, and to assist in the design of pervasive information environments. Many theoretical interdisciplinary approaches are relevant to the design of effective pervasive spaces. A core concept in pervasive informatics is the range of interactions that may occur in pervasive spaces: people to people, people to the physical and the physical space to technological artefacts such as sensors. In order to study these interactions it is necessary to have an understanding of what information is being created and exchanged. In light of this, a series of theories which enable us to consider both social and technological interactions together form the foundations of pervasive informatics Liu, K., Nakata, K. and Harty, C. , Pervasive informatics: theory, practice and future directions. Intelligent Buildings International, Volume 2, Number 1, 2010, pp. 5-19(15) = STS = Socio-technical systems provide an approach which assists in understanding and supporting the use of pervasive technologies. The space could be considered as a network of artefacts, information, technology and occupants. By adopting STS approaches, a means for dynamically investigating and mapping such networks becomes possible. = Distributed cognition = Distributed cognition can be used to explain how information is passed and processed, with a focus on both interactions between people, in addition to their interactions with the environment.Hollan, J., HUtchins, E. and Krish, D. , Distributed Cognition: Toward a New Foundation for Human-Computer Interaction Research. ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction, Vol. 7, No. 2, June 2000, Pages 174–196. These interactions are analysed in terms of the trajectories of information. = CSCW = Human interactions with a space, and its effect on coordination mechanisms have been examined in the field of computer supported cooperative work (CSCW). The concepts of media spacesGaver, W., , The Affordances of Media Spaces for Collaboration. In Proceedings of CSCW'92 (Toronto) and awareness have also emerged from CSCW which are of relevance to pervasive informatics. = Semiotics = Semiotics, the study of signs, can be used to assess the effectiveness of a built environment from six different levels: physical, empirical, syntactical, semantic, pragmatic and social. Semiotics enables us to understand the nature and characteristics of sign- based interactions in pervasive spaces.  Trend and future research  The current technology-centred view of pervasive computing is no longer sufficient for studying the information in the built environment. Socio-technical approaches are required to direct attention to the interaction between the built environment and its occupants. The concept of pervasive informatics then captures this shift, and enables current research efforts in different fields to converge their focus and consolidate their methods under one label, leading to a better direction and understanding of this complex domain. Research issues identified for further study in pervasive informatics: *Understanding the impacts of intelligent pervasive spaces and enabling technologies on occupants Moran, S. and Nakata, K. , Analysing the factors affecting users in intelligent pervasive spaces, Intelligent Buildings International, Volume 2, Number 1, 2010, pp. 57-71” *Designing organisations as pervasive information systems—the role of information and artefacts in communication and interaction. *Context-dependent information and knowledge management, towards effective decision support in pervasive spaces. *Service-oriented design of intelligent buildings as adaptive and learning information spaces with regards to norms and emerging practices in intelligent pervasive spaces. *Through-life intelligent support in building management, with a better understanding of the lifecycle of pervasive spaces from the conception, design, implementation, utilisation till recycling to achieve the building performance and sustainability. The list, of course, is not exhaustive, but they all address the issues that lie on the boundaries between the physical, informational and social-capturing the essence of pervasive spaces.

His father was a goldsmith in London, employed in the jewel office of Queen Elizabeth. He attended the University of Cambridge, receiving a master of arts degree in 1574. He studied the theory and practice of chemistry, leaving Cambridge at the age of 40. In 1598, he sent abroad his first treatise concerning the excellency of a medicine drawn from gold.  \\"Aurum Potabile\\"  He commenced medical practice in London without a Licence from the college of Physicians, and after six months was called before the president of the college of Physicians. He was interdicted practice; for disregarding this injunction, he was fined five pounds and committed to prison, whence he was released by a warrant of the lord chief justice. The college however got him recommitted and Anthony submitted. Being again prosecuted for the same offense and refusing to pay a heavy fine, he was kept in prison eight months until released on petition of his wife on the grounds of poverty in 1602. But he continued to practice in defiance of the college and further proceedings were threatened but not carried out, probably because Anthony had powerful friends in court. His practice consisted chiefly, if not entirely, in the prescription and sale of a secret remedy called \\"Aurum Potabile\\", which means \\"Drinkable Gold\\" in Latin, from which he derived a considerable fortune.  Family  Francis married Susan Howe. He died 26 May 1623, Leaving two sons, John and Charles. John became a Physician in London and Charles practiced at Bedford. According to the writer of the Biographia Britanica (1747 i 169) who professed to have derived his information from family manuscripts, Anthony was a man of high character and very liberal to the poor.  Death  He died in his seventy fourth year and was buried in the church of St. Bartholomew the Great, in the isle that joins the north side of the chancel, where a Handsome monument has been erected to his memory with a very remarkable inscription: \\"Sacred to the memory of the worthy and learned Francis Anthony, Dr. of Physic\\" \\"There needs no verse to beautify thy praise, Or keep in memory thy spotless name. Religion, virtue and thy skill did rise A three-fold pillar to thy lasting fame. Though poisonous envy ever fought to blame Or hide the fruits of thy intention, Yet shall they commend that high design Of purest gold to make a medicine, That feel thy help by that, thy rare invention.\\" The career of Dr. Anthony and his conflict with the college of Physicians illustrated the condition of medical profession in the 17th century. He was obnoxious to the college not only because he kept the composition of his remedy a secret, and put it forward as a panacea for all diseases. Anthony was a man of some learning and defended his panacea in several pamphlets, in which he quotes several Authors, chiefly chemists, as Raymond, Lully, and Arnold, de Villa, Nora. He refers to Paracelsus with an apology, but disclaims any special debt to him, and among other authorities, to Conrad Gessner who had written of \\"Aurum Potabile\\" in his writings. Anthony labors to show that metals are excellent medicines, gold, most of all; that by his method it was dissolved in potable form and furnished a universal medicine. His adversaries denied the superiority of metals to other medicines and the special efficacy of gold, and that there was no such thing as a universal medicine, and that Anthony's method did not dissolve gold. Dr. Anthony desired to demonstrate his process to certain select witnesses and it appears that a trial actually took place at the college of physicians in 1609 in the presence of Thomas Lord Knyvet, master of the mint, and other skilled persons, when an ounce of gold was given to Dr. Anthony which by his method failed to dissolve.

Life The son of Peter Archer and his wife Bridget Lahey, he attended Douai College from 1769, and was ordained in 1780, the year of the Gordon Riots. He shortly started to preach in London. Archer was chaplain to the Bavarian minister in London, until 1826. He was created D.D. by Pope Pius VII on 24 August 1821, at the same time as John Lingard. Bishop Milner, in a pastoral (1813), denounced Archer's sermons, which were conciliatory in tone, and forbade them to be publicly read in the chapels of his district. Archer continued to preach to crowded audiences, and his pulpit eloquence was greatly admired, though it appears to have been somewhat stilted and artificial, according to the fashion set by Dr. Hugh Blair. Charles Butler, writing in 1822 of his sermons, remarks: :\\"It has been his aim to satisfy reason, whilst he pleased, charmed, and instructed her; to impress upon the mind just notions of the mysteries and truths of the Gospel; and to show that the ways of virtue are the ways of pleasantness, and her paths the paths of peace. No one has returned from any of his sermons without impressions favourable to virtue, or without some practical lesson which through life, probably in a few days, perhaps even in a few hours, it would be useful for him to remember. When we recollect that this is the fortieth year of Mr. Archer's predication, that he has preached oftener than fifty-two times in every year, and that in the present his hearers hang on all he says with the same avidity as they did in the first, we may think it difficult to find an individual to whose eloquence religion has in our times been so greatly indebted.\\" Publications * Sermons on various Moral and Religious Subjects, for some of the Principal Festivals of the Year,, London, 1789, 8vo; 2nd edit. 4 vols.

Producing wind gusts to 230 km/h (140 mph), the storm was the strongest cyclone on record to hit the Arabian Peninsula until Cyclone Gonu hit in 2007. About 95% of Marisah Island was damaged by the strong winds, including much of the military base. The cyclone dropped 430.6 mm (16.95 in) of rainfall over a 24 hour period on Marisah, which was the highest daily total in the country as of 2003. Overall, the storm killed at least 105 people and left 50,000 homeless. Meteorological history On June 6, a monsoon depression formed in the Arabian Sea about 500 km (315 mi) south-southwest of Goa, India. It initially paralleled the Indian coastline, becoming a tropical storm on June 9 with a minimum barometric pressure of . That day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began tracking the system. The storm moved northward, followed by a northwest turn on June 10. It curved toward the west, and the JTWC reported the cyclone as reaching peak 1-minute sustained winds of 110 km/h (70 mph) on June 11. In addition, the India Meteorological Department estimated the system became a severe cyclonic storm, which has sustained winds of at least . On June 12, the storm attained a minimum pressure of while continuing westward. On June 13, the eye of the cyclone passed over Masirah Island for a 40-minute period, producing peak sustained winds of 167 km/h (104 mph) and a minimum pressure of . The JTWC issued the final advisory at 0800 UTC that day. The Oman Department of Meteorology reported the storm as being much stronger than the JTWC, with sustained winds of 105 mph (165 km/h) and gusts to 230 km/h (140 mph). The cyclone was the strongest on record to make landfall on the Arabian Peninsula, until Cyclone Gonu surpassed it in 2007. Shortly after striking Masirah, the storm moved ashore mainland Oman, causing rapid weakening to tropical depression status. The system dissipated on June 14 after crossing into southeastern Saudi Arabia. Impact and aftermath Along the southwest coast of India, the storm produced high swells of up to in conjunction with the monsoon. The waves affected several drilling rigs operated by the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, forcing work to shut down. The tanker Texaco Plymouth experienced significant structural damage from the storm, losing two lifeboats. The freighter Buxom Island in the central Arabian Sea experienced 139 km/h (86 mph) winds before sinking, which took the lives of 23 of its crew. The military base in Masirah was first warned about the cyclone on June 11\\\\. The next day, officials there raised a Category 3 warning, which was soon upgraded to Category 2\\\\. Aircraft were stored in hangars, and workers inspected the roofs of buildings before riding out the storm in a shelter. Hurricane-force winds struck during the morning hours of June 13, with sustained winds peaking at 167 km/h (104 mph) and gusts to 200 km/h (124 mph). After a lull during the eye's passage, winds then increased out of the southwest towards 185 km/h (115 mph). The strong winds caused buildings to collapse and roof beams to be blown through the air. Every building at the base sustained damage, and virtually all homes in the nearby village were leveled. The radio relay station on the island was also damaged. Overall, the storm wrecked about 95% of the buildings in Masirah, leaving 2,000 people homeless there. Rain totals were significant, with a total of falling northeast of Salalah. A station on Masirah Island reported in 24 hours, more than six times the average annual precipitation there. The total was the highest daily rainfall in the period from 1977 to 2003 nationwide. Floods washed away thousands of animals as well as lime and palm-tree plantations, downing thousands of trees across the region. The rains flooded the main highway from Muscat to Salalah, and also accumulated in the typically dry Dhofar region. There, most drains were unable to withstand the unusual flooding. The cyclone was considered the worst disaster in Oman during the 20th century, and remains the deadliest cyclone as of 2010. Overall, the cyclone caused 105 deaths, and over 5,000 injuries, and left about 20,000 people homeless. The death toll is disputed, as another report indicated 110 deaths in Oman. After the storm, neighboring Saudi Arabia sent assistance to Oman, as did other nations in the Persian Gulf. The cyclone struck before the nation created a coordinated disaster network in 1988; as a result, the relief work was spread among various agencies.

Life Ashton was born on 25 May 1665, at Bradway, in the parish of Norton, Derbyshire. He was admitted to Queens' College, Cambridge, on 18 May 1682, took the degree of B.A., and on 30 April 1687 was elected to a fellowship. After serving for a time as chaplain to Bishop Simon Patrick, he was presented on 10 March 1698-9 to the living of Rattenden in Essex, which he exchanged in the following June for a chaplainship at Chelsea Hospital. On 3 July 1701 he was collated to a prebendal stall in Ely Cathedral, and was elected on the next day to the mastership of Jesus College, Cambridge, both offices being vacant by the death of William Saywell. In the same year he took the degree of D.D., and in 1702 was elected vice-chancellor of the university. Aston's life was scholarly, and he seldom left Cambridge, except to go to Ely. He died in March 1752, at the age of 87, and was buried in the college chapel. Works Ashton's published works are not numerous. He contributed to Joseph Wasse's Bibliotheca Literaria, 1724, an article, \\"Tully and Hirtius reconciled as to the time of Caesar's going to the African war\\"; also an emendation of a passage of Justin Martyr. William Reading's editions of Origen's De Oratione (1728) and Historiæ Ecclesiasticæ Scriptores (1746) are said to have been in great part the work of Ashton. According to George Dyer in his History of the University of Cambridge (1814, ii. p. 80), it was Ashton's edition of Hierocles of Alexandria's commentary on The golden verses of Pythagoras that was published as by \\"R.

The Gazelle class was the culmination of earlier unprotected cruiser and aviso designs, combining the best aspects of both types in what became the progenitor of all future light cruisers of the Imperial fleet. Built to be able to serve with the main German fleet and as a colonial cruiser, she was armed with a battery of ten guns and a top speed of . Medusa served in all three German navies—the Kaiserliche Marine, the Reichsmarine (Navy of the Realm) of Weimar Germany, and the Kriegsmarine (War Navy) of Nazi Germany—over the span of over forty years. During her career in the Imperial fleet, she served in the reconnaissance unit for the High Seas Fleet from 1903 to 1907; during this period, she took part in cruises overseas and routine training exercises. She temporarily replaced her sister ship as a gunnery training ship in 1908 while the latter was undergoing repairs. Medusa was herself overhauled and then placed in reserve until August 1914, when the outbreak of World War I led to her recommissioning. She initially operated in the mouth of the Elbe, supporting the flotilla tasked with defending the mouth of the river. She was transferred to the Baltic in late 1915 after her sister was sunk, where she served as the flagship of the Coastal Defense Division. Decommissioned again at the end of 1916, she was used as an auxiliary ship for the rest of the war. Medusa was among the six light cruisers Germany was permitted to retain under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, and she was the first major warship to return to service in 1920; as a result, she served as the Reichmarines flagship until relieved by the battleship in 1921. Her career in the early 1920s followed a similar pattern to her prewar years, being occupied with training exercises and visits to foreign ports. She was decommissioned for the last time in 1924 and subsequently used as a barracks ship until 1940, when during World War II, she was converted into a floating anti-aircraft battery. Based outside Wilhelmshaven, she helped to defend the port for the rest of the war, before being badly damaged in an air raid in April 1945. Her crew scuttled her on 3 May, and she was later broken up in 1948–1950. Design Following the construction of the unprotected cruiser and the aviso for the German Kaiserliche Marine (Imperial Navy), the Construction Department of the Reichsmarineamt (Imperial Navy Office) prepared a design for a new small cruiser that combined the best attributes of both vessels. The designers had to design a small cruiser with armor protection that had an optimal combination of speed, armament, and stability, along with the endurance to operate on foreign stations in the German colonial empire. The resulting Gazelle design provided the basis for all of the light cruisers built by the German fleet to the last official designs prepared in 1914. Medusa was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of forward. She displaced normally and up to at full combat load. Her propulsion system consisted of two triple-expansion steam engines. They were designed to give , for a top speed of . The engines were powered by ten coal-fired Marine-type water-tube boilers. Medusa carried of coal, which gave her a range of at . She had a crew of 14 officers and 243 enlisted men. The ship was armed with ten SK L/40 guns in single mounts. Two were placed side by side forward on the forecastle, six were located amidships, three on either side, and two were placed side by side aft. The guns could engage targets out to . They were supplied with 1,000 rounds of ammunition, for 100 shells per gun. She was also equipped with two torpedo tubes with five torpedoes. They were submerged in the hull on the broadside. The ship was protected by an armored deck that was thick. The conning tower had thick sides, and the guns were protected by thick gun shields. Service history =Pre-war career= One of the Gazelle-class cruisers, possibly Medusa, in Kiel in 1901 Medusa was ordered under the contract name \\"E\\" and was laid down at the AG Weser shipyard in Bremen on 22 January 1900. She was launched on 5 December 1900; at the launching ceremony, she was christened by Princess Augusta, the wife of Philipp, Prince of Eulenburg. The ship was named for the earlier screw corvette . She was moved to the Kaiserliche Werft (Imperial Shipyard) in Wilhelmshaven to have her armament installed. The ship was commissioned for sea trials on 26 July 1901 that lasted until 11 September, after which she was decommissioned due to crew shortages. She remained in reserve for the next two years. Medusa was finally commissioned for active service on 1 April 1903, under the command of Korvettenkapitän (KK—Corvette Captain) William Kutter, thereafter joining the reconnaissance screen for I Battle Squadron. She took part in a cruise from May to June to Spain with the rest of the squadron that included a visit to Vigo, Spain, from 20 to 30 May. In July, she visited Stavanger, Norway, during the fleet cruise in the North Sea. The next year, she was present for a naval review in the Kieler Förde for King Edward VII of Great Britain during his visit to Germany. This was followed by a visit of the German fleet to Britain, after which Medusa stopped in the Netherlands from 14 to 20 July 1904. In September, Fregattenkapitän (FK—Frigate Captain) Paul Schlieper replaced Kutter as the ship's commander. She took part in fleet maneuvers in July and August 1905 that were conducted in Norwegian waters. During the exercises, she anchored off Uddevalla from 20 to 24 July. Following the maneuvers in September, KF Friedrich Schultz relieved Schlieper as the ship's captain. The fleet repeated the visit to Norway for maneuvers in July and August 1906; that year, Medusa visited Ålesund and Kristiansand. The fleet training maneuvers held in August and September concluded with a naval review in honor of the retiring fleet commander, Grossadmiral (Grand Admiral) Hans von Koester. Immediately afterward, KK Wilhelm Starke took command of the ship from Schultz. That year, Medusas gunners earned the Schiesspreis (Shooting Prize) for small cruisers, awarded every year by Kaiser Wilhelm II. The year 1907 passed uneventfully for Medusa, apart from during the annual fleet maneuvers on 7 September, when the ship suffered a machinery breakdown, forcing her to return to Kiel for repairs. On 15 September, she was replaced in the scout unit by the new cruiser . Four days later, Medusa in turn replaced her sister ship as the gunnery training ship for automatic weapons in the Naval Artillery Inspectorate. At that time, KK Heinrich Trendtel replaced Starke as the ship's commander, though he remained aboard for just four months, being replaced in January 1908 by KK Jantzen. She served in this capacity for eight months during Nymphes overhaul, thereafter being decommissioned on 23 May 1908 when her sister returned to service. Medusa was then overhauled and placed in reserve, where she remained for the next six years. =World War I= Map of the North and Baltic Seas in 1911 Following the outbreak of World War I in July 1914, Medusa was recommissioned on 4 August, under the command of FK Erich von Zeppelin. She was tasked with supporting the coastal patrol in the mouth of the Elbe on 11 August, where she remained through 13 September 1915. During this period, she patrolled the area and monitored shipping entering the Elbe without incident. The ship was transferred to Wilhelmshaven on 14 September, where her crew was reduced five days later. She was not decommissioned, however, and over the course of 30 November – 1 December, her crew was replenished and she was ordered to replace her sister , which had been torpedoed and sunk in the western Baltic Sea. There, she joined the Coastal Defense Division. She arrived in Warnemünde on 26 December and began her patrol duties, which she performed for the next year. During this period, she also served as a target ship to train U-boat and torpedo boat crews. She was the flagship of Vizeadmiral (Vice Admiral) Robert Mischke from February to December 1916. Medusa took Mischke on a tour of the central Baltic, cruising from Swinemünde to Danzig on 31 October 1916, then to Libau and then Memel before returning to Swinemünde on 7 November. By the end of the year, the naval command decided to withdraw Medusa from service, owing to her obsolescence in the face of modern weapons and to worsening crew shortages. She was accordingly decommissioned on 18 December in Kiel and then transferred to Flensburg. There, she was used as an auxiliary ship for the old ironclad , which was being used as a training ship for naval cadets. Four of her guns were removed in 1917. Medusa served in that capacity for the remainder of the war, which ended on 11 November 1918. =Reichsmarine and Kriegsmarine career= Medusa was among the six light cruises Germany was permitted to retain under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles that ended the war. The postwar Reichsmarine was obligated by the treaty to clear the minefields that had been laid in the North Sea during the war, and the command initially planned to convert Medusa into a mother ship for the planned 12th Minesweeper Half-Flotilla, but the unit was not created and Medusa therefore was not converted. Instead, she was recommissioned on 17 July 1920 with FK Alexander Werth as her captain, the first major warship to be commissioned in the interwar period. At that time, she was assigned to the Marinestation der Ostsee (Baltic Sea Naval Station), which also included two torpedo boat flotillas and the survey ship . One of her first activities was to carry President Friedrich Ebert on a trip to East Prussia. She later visited foreign ports between 30 August and 5 September, including Fårösund and Visby on the island of Gotland in Sweden. On 10 February 1921, the battleship was recommissioned, and at the same time relieved Medusa as the flagship. The two ships, along with both torpedo boat flotillas, conducted training exercises in June and July in the western Baltic. Medusa then made another series of visits to ports in the Baltic between 28 July and 2 August, including Uddevalla and Gothenburg, Sweden. She operated as an icebreaker in the Gulf of Riga from 24 January to 12 February 1922, and during this period she visited Windau, Latvia from 2 to 9 February. She next visited Gävle, Sweden from 22 to 26 June, followed by ports in Finland between 29 June and 3 July. In September, KK Ernst Meusel replaced Werth as the ship's captain; he was to be the vessel's last commanding officer. Medusa returned to Gothenburg from 11 to 15 July 1923 along with I Half-Flotilla, followed by stops in Molde on 19 July and then Åndalsnes, both in Norway. In October, the Marinestation was reorganized, since by this time enough battleships had been recommissioned to create a separate Battleship Division; Medusa became part of the light naval forces unit. From 5 to 12 July 1924, she visited Gävle again and on 26 September, she was decommissioned. From 1 February 1928, Medusa began to serve as a barracks ship for torpedo boat and destroyer crews in Wilhelmshaven. On 29 March 1929, she was stricken from the naval register. In July 1940, during World War II, Medusa was converted into a floating anti-aircraft battery at the Rickmers Reederei shipyard in Bremerhaven. Her armament at that point consisted of one 10.5 cm SK C/32 gun, four 10.5 cm SK C/33 guns, two SK C/30 guns, and four Flak guns. She was then assigned to Naval Anti-aircraft Group 222, and remained in the harbor at Wilhelmshaven, anchored off Varel, beginning on 13 August 1940. She remained there for the duration of the war. On 19 April 1945, she was badly damaged by an Allied air attack that killed twenty-three and wounded forty-one of her crew. Her remaining crew scuttled the ship on 3 May, days before the end of the war in Europe. British occupation troops found the wreck lying next to the . The wreck was ultimately salvaged in 1948–1950 and broken up for scrap.

It was the film debut of Cornish, Boyega, and composer Steven Price. The film centres on a teenage street gang who have to defend themselves from predatory alien invaders on a council estate in South London on Guy Fawkes Night. Released on 11 May 2011, it underperformed at the box office but received a positive critical reception, with particular praise for Cornish's direction and Boyega's performance, and several international accolades. Plot Samantha Adams, a trainee nurse, is mugged by a gang of teenage hoodlums: Pest, Dennis, Jerome, Biggz, and leader Moses. When a meteorite falls from the sky into a nearby car, Samantha escapes. As Moses searches the wreck of the car for valuables, his face is scratched by a small alien creature. The creature runs away, but the gang chase and kill it. Hoping to gain fame and fortune, they take the dead animal to their acquaintance, cannabis dealer Ron and his boss Hi-Hatz, an incredibly dimwitted and petty gang leader. More objects fall from the sky. Eager to fight the creatures, the gang arm themselves and go to the nearest crash site. However, they find these aliens are much larger and threatening. Fleeing the aliens, the gang are intercepted by two policemen accompanying Samantha, and Moses is arrested. The aliens follow Moses and maul the unarmed officers to death, leaving Samantha and Moses trapped inside a van. Dennis reaches the vehicle and drives away, only to crash into Hi-Hatz's car. Samantha runs away while the rest of Moses's gang catch up and confront Hi-Hatz and his henchman. The gang try to flee to Wyndham Tower, but are attacked by the aliens; Biggz is forced to hide and Pest is bitten in the leg. They find that Samantha lives in their building and persuade her to treat Pest's leg. An alien bursts in and Moses kills it with a samurai sword. Realizing that the group was not lying about the creatures being extraterrestrial, Samantha joins them. The gang moves upstairs to the flat owned by Tia, Dimples, Dionna, and Gloria, believing that their security gate will keep them safe. The aliens instead attack from outside, smashing through the windows and decapitating Dennis. The girls believe them to be the focus of the creatures and kick them out of the flat. Hi-Hatz and two more henchmen attack the gang, but an alien arrives and chases Hi-Hatz and the henchmen into a lift, which only Hi-Hatz makes it out alive. Making their way upstairs to Ron's weed room, the gang runs into more aliens, but using fireworks as a distraction, they manage to get through. Jerome becomes disoriented in the smoke and is killed by an alien. Entering Ron's flat, they find that Hi-Hatz is waiting for them there, who prepares to shoot Moses but he is then suddenly attacked and killed by the aliens who broke through the window. The group flee and are now joined by Brewis, one of Ron's customers and a zoology student. Moses, Pest and Samantha retreat into the weed room, while Ron hides in the flat. In the weed room, Brewis notices a luminescent stain on Moses' jacket under the ultraviolet light. Brewis theorises that the aliens are like spores, drifting through space on solar winds until they chance on a habitable planet. After landing in an area with enough food, the female lets off a strong pheromone to attract the male creatures so that they can mate and propagate their species. Moses persuades the rest of the gang to return Samantha's stolen ring and they together they form a plan. As Samantha has not been stained with the alien pheromone she can to go to Moses's flat and turn on the gas oven. Samantha successfully bypasses the aliens and turns on the gas in the flat. She leaves the block and Moses, with the body of the small alien strapped to his back, runs to the gas filled apartment with all of the aliens following him. He throws the dead small alien into the apartment, and then using fireworks he ignites the gas-filled room and leaps out of the window. The resulting explosion kills all of the aliens and leaves a portion of the block in flames. In the aftermath, Moses, Pest, Brewis, and Ron are arrested and held responsible for the deaths around the block. The police then ask Samantha to identify Moses and his friends as those who killed everyone, including the two police officers that had arrested Moses earlier. Instead Samantha corrects them by saying that all of the boys are her neighbours and they protected her. In the back of the police van, Moses and Pest hear the residents of the block cheering for Moses they both smile. Cast Representative of the film's plot and location, most of the cast (many of whom spoke Multicultural London English during the film) were young, relative unknowns, and local to the area. According to the DVD's making-of featurette, the teenagers were selected from drama classes of London council estate schools, and then had to go through eight auditions before being offered a part.DVD \\"making of\\" featurette John Boyega found out about this film from an ad placed on the internet. The cast includes: * John Boyega as Moses, a low level crook, teenage gang leader and orphan looking for respect around the block. * Jodie Whittaker as Samantha Adams, a trainee nurse and new resident of Wyndham Tower. * Alex Esmail as Pest, a teenage jokester, pyromaniac and second in command of Moses's gang. * Franz Drameh as Dennis, a hotheaded pizza delivery boy and the enforcer of the gang. * Leeon Jones as Jerome, a schoolboy and the most level headed member of the gang. * Simon Howard as Biggz, the youngest member of the gang. Throughout most of the film, Biggz is trapped in a skip after he's cornered by the aliens. * Nick Frost as Ron, the local drug dealer who lives in the penthouse of Wyndham Tower and knows everyone. * Luke Treadaway as Brewis, a posh student stoner who's one of Ron's customers. * Jumayn Hunter as Hi-Hatz, the local psychopathic gangster who's Ron's feared boss and the true main antagonist. * Danielle Vitalis as Tia, a girl living in Wyndham Tower who's Moses's love interest and friend to the gang. * Paige Meade as Dimples, Tia's quick tempered roommate who is also a friend to the gang. * Sammy Williams as Probs, a little kid who wishes to join Moses's gang. * Michael Ajao as Mayhem, Probs's best friend who shares his goal of joining Moses's gang. Production Big Talk Pictures, known for films including Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz, and Scott Pilgrim vs. The World, produced the film alongside Film4, The UK Film Council, and StudioCanal. The plot was inspired by an event where the director was mugged himself, and after adding the science fiction angle into the plot, Joe Cornish interviewed various kids in youth groups in order to find out what kind of weapons they would use if a real alien invasion occurred. The director wanted to counter the trend of 'hoodie horror' films which demonised urban youths. Cornish also based the character of the stoner Brewis on himself in his twenties. =Filming= Attack the Block is set in a fictional neighbourhood said in- film to be located in the London district of Brixton. It is actually a composite of various council estates across London. Director Cornish explains: > We wanted to stamp a clear layout on the audience's minds early, and since > we couldn't afford to show an aerial shot of the estate as it doesn't exist, > the way to show it was by showing this top shot of the map at the very > beginning of the film. The name Wyndham Estates appears on the left of the entrance to the fictional block, referencing the English science-fiction writer John Wyndham. The science fiction writer J. G. Ballard is also referenced by one of the street names; Ballard wrote a number of novels set in large urban blocks. The film was shot across London from March to May 2010, with six weeks of night shoots on the Heygate Estate in Elephant and Castle; Myatts Field, Brixton; Oval Underground station and the Bemerton Estate in Islington. Interior scenes were filmed at Three Mills Studios in Newham, part of the East End of London. =Creature effects= The creatures began with two men in gorilla-like suits with animatronic jaws; post-production added the unearthly qualities such as the spiky fur which doesn't reflect any light, the claws, the rows of bioluminescent jaws, and even some of their movement. In total the film features over 100 effects shots, which were completed over the course of 4 months by Swedish effects house, Fido. The creatures have no eyes, and hunt and find mates using an extremely evolved sense of smell; their movement is enabled mainly through echolocation. According to the DVD commentary, the echolocation noises made by the creatures were a combination of dolphin sonar mixed digitally with the grunts and snarls of dozens of other animals, and even a woman screaming.DVD commentary track Some puppets were used, such as the smaller, hairless female alien which terrified the young cast. Release =Theatrical= StudioCanal's British distribution company Optimum Releasing released the film in the United Kingdom on 11 May 2011. Sony Pictures Worldwide Acquisitions acquired this film's United States distribution rights, and the group opened this film in limited theatrical release in the United States on 29 July 2011 through Screen Gems. US distributors were concerned that American audiences might not understand the strong South London accents, and may have even used subtitles if it were to be released in the United States. Cornish acknowledged this during the SXSW Q and A. When he asked the audience, \\"Can I ask you guys something? American distributors are nervous about language, the slang\\" the audience said they could understand it. =Home media= The film was released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc in the United Kingdom on 19 September 2011 and in the United States on 25 October 2011. Play.com have an exclusive Blu-ray and DVD double play edition, with a glow-in-the-dark sleeve, featuring the bio-luminescent jaws of one of the creatures. =Soundtrack= The soundtrack for the film was an original score composed by British electronic music group Basement Jaxx, and Steven Price except for a few songs featured in the film but not on the soundtrack (such as the 1993 rap track \\"Sound of da Police\\" by KRS-One, and the 2006 reggae track \\"Youths Dem Cold\\" by Richie Spice, played during the end credits). During Evan Sawdey's interview with the duo for PopMatters, he mentioned the album as an \\"obscure soundtrack placement that only hardcore aficionados found out about.\\" In 2018 I Am Shark reissued the soundtrack on a 2xLP vinyl pressing featuring exclusive written commentaries from Joe Cornish and Steven Price. The album packaging represents the monsters with glow in the dark teeth on the labels and glow colored vinyl. The original Attack the Block soundtrack by Basement Jaxx and Steven Price features the following tracks: # \\"The Block\\" # \\"Sam is Mugged\\" # \\"Round Two Bruv\\" # \\"It's Raining Gollums\\" # \\"Tooling Up\\" # \\"Moses is Arrested\\" # \\"Tell Me I'm Dreaming\\" # \\"Throat Ripper\\" # \\"Rooftops\\" # \\"Moses – Ninja\\" # \\"Just Another Day\\" # \\"They Want Moses\\" # \\"Actions Have Consequences\\" # \\"Eat My Hat\\" # \\"They Fell Out of the Sky\\" # \\"I Need to Finish What I Started\\" # \\"Turn the Gas Up\\" # \\"Moses vs. The Monsters\\" # \\"Moses the Hero\\" # \\"The Ends\\" A rap song called \\"Get That Snitch\\", original to the film and rapped by the character Hi-Hatz, is featured at various times in the film. The full song was featured on the DVD special features. The score and soundtrack album was mixed by Gareth Cousins. Reception =Box office= On its opening theatrical weekend in the United Kingdom in May 2011, Attack the Block garnered £1,133,859, putting it in third place only slightly behind American blockbusters Thor and Fast Five; also in the opening weekend Attack the Block had the highest cinema site average by almost twice of the other films. On a screen-by-screen basis, Attack the Block was the week's strongest performer. The North American theatrical run began in July 2011 and was only a limited release, yet despite being shown for less than two months and in only 66 cinemas at its peak, the film grossed $1,024,175 (£659,040) on its American theatrical run. =Critical response= Attack the Block received acclaim from critics. Review aggregation Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 90% based on 174 reviews, with an average rating of 7.43/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Effortlessly mixing scares, laughs, and social commentary, Attack the Block is a thrilling, brisky-paced sci-fi yarn with a distinctly British flavor.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 75 out of 100, based on 27 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". The website Slash film lists Attack the Block as a \\"true cult classic\\" deserving of its own action figures. In his review, Chicago Sun-Times critic Roger Ebert praised the film's use of character development and the performance given by Boyega. Scott Wampler of The Examiner rated it A+ and said it was officially the best film of the 2011 film festival season and likened it to other debuts such as Neill Blomkamp's District 9 and Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs. Matt Patches writing for Cinemablend said \\"Attack the Block, even on its small scale, may wind up as one of the best action movies of the year\\". Christ Tilly at IGN gave it four stars saying \\"Cornish directs with the confidence of a seasoned pro\\" and calling the film \\"a blast from start-to-finish.\\" Ben Rawson- Jones of Digital Spy awarded the movie four stars, saying that it is \\"exactly the kind of distinctly homegrown product that the British film industry should be making\\". Mark Kermode gave a mixed review saying he did not dislike the film, but \\"wanted it to be funnier\\" and \\"needed it to be scarier\\". Attack the Block was revisited by critics following the casting of its two lead actors as stars of flagship science fiction franchises – Boyega as Finn in Star Wars and Whittaker as the Thirteenth Doctor in Doctor Who. In a 2017 retrospective, Tom Philip writing for GQ described the film as \\"one of the most confidently- delivered debut feature films in recent memory\\" and said it \\"still stands out as one of the best genre-mashup films of the decade\\", while Nathan Rabin for Rotten Tomatoes said that the film deserved cult status and called it \\"a star- making vehicle in the truest sense\\". It was listed among Wired Magazines best films of the 2010s. =Accolades= * Audience Award for Best Film (Midnights) at SXSW 2011 * Audience Award for Best Narrative Feature at the Los Angeles Film Festival * Audience Award for Best European or American Feature at the 2011 Fantasia Festival * Melies d'Argent for Best European Fantastic Feature Film 2011 at the Lund International Fantastic Film Festival * Muut Award for Best Visual Concept at the 2011 Miskolc International Film Festival * Bassan Arts and Crafts Award for Best Production Design at the Torino Film Festival 2011 * Golden Mouse Online Critics Award for Best Film at the Torino Film Festival 2011 * Best Debut Director at the 2011 New York Film Critics Online Awards * Best First Feature at the 2011 Toronto Film Critics Association Awards * Best Original Soundtrack at the 2011 Sitges Film Festival * Special Jury Award at the 2011 Sitges Film Festival * Audience Award for Best Motion Picture at the 2011 Sitges Film Festival * Jose Luis Guarner Critic Award at the 2011 Sitges Film Festival * Special Mention at the 2011 Black Film Critics Circle Awards: \\"Attack The Block is a genre film that defies a number of conventions, not only by having a primarily black cast but portraying each character with a dignity seldom seen on screen and even more rarely in a Science-Fiction film.\\" * Best First Film at the 2011 Austin Film Critics Association Awards * Best Original Score at the 2011 Austin Film Critics Association Awards * Best Actor to John Boyega at the 2011 Black Reel Awards * Outstanding Foreign Film at the 2011 Black Reel Awards References External links  2011 horror films British films English-language films 2010s action comedy films 2010s comedy horror films 2010s science fiction horror films British action comedy films British science fiction films British comedy horror films British coming-of-age films British independent films 2011 directorial debut films Alien invasions in films Black British mass media Films about drugs Films set in London Films shot in London Hood films 2010s monster movies British science fiction action films Big Talk Productions films Film4 Productions films StudioCanal films Films with screenplays by Joe Cornish Films scored by Steven Price British monster movies 2011 comedy films ","title":"Attack the Block"},{"id":"30088772","text":"Stigmella parinarella is a moth of the family Nepticulidae.

The Gazelle class was the culmination of earlier unprotected cruiser and aviso designs, combining the best aspects of both types in what became the progenitor of all future light cruisers of the Imperial fleet. Built to be able to serve with the main German fleet and as a colonial cruiser, she was armed with a battery of ten guns and a top speed of . After commissioning in late 1901, Amazone spent the first four years of her career in the reconnaissance forces of the German fleet. There, she earned a reputation for being the most accident-prone vessel of the fleet, being involved in numerous collisions and other accidents. During this period, she conducted training exercises with the rest of the fleet and made several trips abroad. As more modern cruisers began to enter service in 1905, Amazone was placed in reserve until the start of World War I in 1914. During the war, she operated in the Baltic Sea in the Detached Division, taking part in numerous operations in the central and northern Baltic to support the German Army. By the end of 1914, Amazone was no longer able to keep up with the other cruisers in the Baltic, so she was transferred to the Coastal Defense Division. She saw no action during this period, apart from a pair of failed British submarine attacks. Reduced to a torpedo testing and target ship by early 1916, she was disarmed and converted into a barracks ship in early 1917, seeing no further activity during the war. Among the few major warships that Germany was permitted to retain under the Treaty of Versailles, Amazone served after the war in the Reichsmarine (Navy of the Realm) after being modernized and rearmed in 1921–1923. She took part in training exercises and cruises abroad through the rest of the 1920s, frequently to ports in Scandinavia, but also as far as the Mediterranean Sea. Decommissioned in 1930, she was again reduced to a barracks hulk, serving in that capacity through World War II and into the postwar years. Left unused beginning in 1951, she was ultimately broken up in 1954, the last-surviving member of the Gazelle class. Design Following the construction of the unprotected cruiser and the aviso for the German Kaiserliche Marine (Imperial Navy), the Construction Department of the Reichsmarineamt (Imperial Navy Office) prepared a design for a new small cruiser that combined the best attributes of both vessels. The designers had to design a small cruiser with armor protection that had an optimal combination of speed, armament, and stability, along with the endurance to operate on foreign stations in the German colonial empire. The resulting Gazelle design provided the basis for all of the light cruisers built by the German fleet to the last official designs prepared in 1914. Amazone was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of forward. She displaced normally and up to at full combat load. Her propulsion system consisted of two triple- expansion steam engines. They were designed to give , for a top speed of . The engines were powered by ten coal-fired Marine-type water-tube boilers. Amazone carried of coal, which gave her a range of at . She had a crew of 14 officers and 243 enlisted men. The ship was armed with ten SK L/40 guns in single mounts. Two were placed side by side forward on the forecastle, six were located amidships, three on either side, and two were placed side by side aft. The guns could engage targets out to . They were supplied with 1,000 rounds of ammunition, for 100 shells per gun. She was also equipped with two torpedo tubes with five torpedoes. They were submerged in the hull on the broadside. The ship was protected by an armored deck that was thick. The conning tower had thick sides, and the guns were protected by thick gun shields. Service history =Construction – 1902 = One of the Gazelle-class cruisers, possibly Amazone, in Kiel in 1901 Amazone was ordered under the contract name \\"F\\" and was laid down at the Germaniawerft shipyard in Kiel in December 1899 and was launched on 6 October 1900. At her launching ceremony, Vizeadmiral (Vice Admiral) Alfred von Tirpitz gave a speech and Princess Hilda of Nassau christened the ship. After fitting-out work was completed, she underwent builder's sea trials before being was commissioned on 15 November 1901 for acceptance trials conducted by the navy. Her first commander was Korvettenkapitän (KK—Corvette Captain) Ludwig Bruch. After her commissioning, Amazone was employed in the reconnaissance forces of the German fleet, joining the fleet screen on 21 December. The ship took part in squadron training in the Baltic Sea in March 1902, followed by a voyage around the British Isles that began on 24 April. While passing near the Sevenstones Lightship on 24 May, the battleship accidentally rammed Amazone, striking her aft of her forward mast, causing extensive flooding that filled several compartments with water. Amazone nevertheless remained afloat and able to steam under her own power, and she arrived at the Kaiserliche Werft (Imperial Shipyard) in Kiel three days later. This was the first in a series of accidents that made Amazone, according to the historians Hans Hildebrand, Albert Röhr, and Hans- Otto Steinmetz, the most accident-prone vessel of the Imperial fleet. The ship was under repair until the end of July. After completing repairs, Amazone joined the battleships of I Squadron for maneuvers in the Kattegat and the North Sea. In August, she took part in the annual maneuvers held with the combined fleet; these were also conducted in the North Sea, between 17 August and 11 September. During the exercises, she operated with I Scouting Group, and she was detached to Hamburg from 5 to 6 September. Amazone had the auxiliary hospital ship Hansa tied alongside for training, which caused damage to Amazones hull, necessitating further repairs at the Kaiserliche Werft in Kiel that began on 21 September. Bruch left the ship at that time, and KK Gerhard Gerdes took command of the ship in October. The naval command initially planned to send Amazone to join the German squadron participating in the naval blockade of Venezuela of 1902–1903, but she was instead kept in European waters, being sent with I Squadron for its winter cruise to Bergen, Norway in December. =1903–1905= Amazone, c. 1902–1903 On 1 March 1903, the Reconnaissance Unit was created under the command of Konteradmiral (Rear Admiral) Ludwig Borckenhagen, and Amazone was assigned to the organization. The ships joined I Squadron for a training cruise into the Atlantic on 7 May, travelling as far as Spain. During the voyage, Amazone was detached to Brest, France on 2 June to pick up mail for the fleet. While approaching the harbor, she ran aground on an uncharted rock outside the breakwater. The French had failed to send out a pilot boat to guide Amazone into the harbor, but they assisted with refloating the vessel at high tide. Amazone then returned to Kiel, where upon inspection, she was found to have been undamaged in the accident. Nevertheless, a court martial was held aboard the hulk to investigate the accident. Gerdes and the navigation officer were sentenced to being confined to their quarters for a few days, but he nevertheless remained in command of the vessel. From 4 to 30 July, Amazone took part in squadron exercises in the North Sea. The annual fleet maneuvers followed from 15 August to 12 September, and the training year ended with a winter cruise from 23 November to 5 December. The ships of the Reconnaissance Unit began the year 1904 with training exercises in the Skagerrak, followed by further maneuvers in the central Baltic. In April, KK Leberecht Maass replaced Gerdes. Amazone served as the flotilla leader for I Torpedo-boat Flotilla for exercises on 6 April off the Baltic coast of Schleswig-Holstein before the ships moved to the North Sea for additional maneuvers that lasted until 20 May, after which KK Rudolf Berger replaced Maass. After returning to the Reconnaissance Unit, she took part in a cruise to Britain and the Netherlands from 23 July to 12 August. After anchoring in the Kieler Förde on 12 August, Amazone was struck by the Russian barque Anna, though she was not seriously damaged in the accident. It nevertheless contributed to the ship's reputation for being prone to accidents. She then joined the fleet for its annual maneuvers that were conducted between 29 August and 15 September. Squadron training with the Reconnaissance Unit took place in January 1905. During exercises with the torpedo boat training flotilla on 3 March, Amazone collided with the torpedo boat . She towed D6 back to Kiel and then went into dry dock for repairs that lasted for three weeks. On 4 April, Amazone resumed her previous year's activities as a flotilla leader, and Maass came back aboard for the next month. She operated with I Torpedo-boat Flotilla during maneuvers held off Sassnitz until 21 May. Now-Fregattenkapitän (FK—Frigate Captain) Berger once again relieved Maass after the ship returned to the Reconnaissance Unit. Late in the month, she joined her squadron-mates for exercises in the North Sea. These activities continued through July, along with visits to Norwegian ports. The fleet maneuvers followed in August and were held in the North and Baltic Seas. After their conclusion, Amazone was replaced in the Reconnaissance Unit by the light cruiser and she was decommissioned in Kiel on 28 September, being placed in reserve, where she remained for the next nine years. =World War I= Map of the North and Baltic Seas in 1911 1914 Following the outbreak of World War I in July 1914, Amazone was recommissioned on 2 August under the command of KK Johannes Horn; she briefly served as the flagship of KAdm Robert Mischke, the commander of the Coastal Defense Division of the Baltic Sea, from 6 to 8 August. The unit included six other light cruisers, the old protected cruiser , and the gunboat , among other vessels. Through the month, she patrolled the western and central Baltic as far north as Gotland, and the coast of Russia. She was ordered to destroy a Russian radio tower near Libau, but by the time she arrived, the Russians had already dismantled it and removed it. During this period, the airship M IV landed on Amazones deck, as part of an experiment to determine if a warship could tow an airship to the eastern Baltic for operations there. The tests revealed that Amazone could only steam at very low speed to avoid damaging M IV; even wave action from the wakes of a group of passing torpedo boats while Amazone was anchored forced the airship captain to sever the tow lines. Initial experience in the war led the German naval command to divide Mischke's responsibilities, leaving him with defensive operations in the western Baltic, while separating offensive operations to a new Detached Division under KAdm Ehler Behring. Amazone was assigned to the unit and her first operation was to escort the U-boat to Dagerort. She next embarked on a sweep into the central Baltic with the light cruisers and on 26 August. Amazone took up an advanced position ahead of Behring's other cruisers, and during the operation, Magdeburg ran aground off the lighthouse at Odensholm on the Estonian coast. Upon receiving a report of the incident, Amazone turned back to come to Magdeburgs aid, but by the time she arrived, Russian cruisers had already appeared and Magdeburgs crew had detonated scuttling charges. Amazone embarked part of her crew and carried them to Danzig. On 30 August, Amazone conducted another patrol in the area off Gotland that resulted in no contact with Russian forces. Another operation took place on 7 September, during a sortie led by the large armored cruiser . Amazone was sent to screen the vessel by cruising off Gotska Sandön to prevent the formation from being outflanked. The battleships of IV Battle Squadron and Amazone then conducted a demonstration off Windau the next day. Amazone then returned to Danzig before being sent to assist in the defense of Memel from 12 to 16 September. U3 and the torpedo boat also took part in the operation. Amazone sent a landing party ashore, but they took part in no fighting. The Germans planned a major amphibious assault on Windau later that month; the IV Squadron battleships were to lead the operation, while those of V Battle Squadron were to carry German Army units. Amazone escorted minesweepers as they cleared the route on 24 September and during this work, she shelled a Russian lighthouse. The attack was called off after reports incorrectly indicated that British cruisers and submarines were preparing to break into the Baltic through the Danish straits, necessitating a redeployment of German warships to the western Baltic. Amazone conducted another sweep to Windau on 9–10 October, during which she had to take the U-boat under tow after the submarine's engine broke down. The next operation, to shell Libau and block the harbor entrance with blockships, began on 17 November. Behring's flagship, the armored cruiser , struck a pair of naval mines and sank, but Amazone and the light cruiser , along with their accompanying torpedo boats, entered Libau and bombarded the port. From 18 November to 15 December, Amazone was tasked with patrolling Danzig Bay, with occasional stints in the Aarøsund. On 15 December, Amazone joined Behring's new flagship, the armored cruiser , and the light cruisers , Augsburg, and Lübeck for a reconnaissance sweep toward the Åland Islands at the northern end of the Baltic. On the way north, Amazone proved to be unable to keep pace with the other cruisers, so she was detached off Gotska Sandön to return to port. From 26 to 30 December, she escorted the V Squadron battleships on a sortie to Gotland. 1915–1918 In April 1915, Amazone was transferred back to the Coastal Defense Division. She underwent an overhaul after arriving in the western Baltic and thereafter embarked on patrols in the region. She frequently operated with her sister ships and between Sassnitz and Trelleborg, in the Aarøsund, and around the island of Langeland. On 8 May, Amazone was patrolling off Cape Arkona when she was attacked by the British submarine . The submarine fired a torpedo from a range of , but it missed Amazone. On 9 September, another British submarine, , unsuccessfully attacked Amazone during the Battle of the Gulf of Riga. On 11 February 1916, Amazone was sent to Libau, which had by that time been captured by German forces, to defend the port as a replacement for the cruiser , remaining there until 24 February. In March 1916, Amazone was released from the Coastal Defense Division and assigned to the U-boat Inspectorate for use as a target ship. She filled this role for the rest of her time in commission during the war. At the same time, her torpedo armament was expanded, though the number and type of torpedo tubes added are unknown. After sea trials in early April, her crew was reduced and between July and September, all of her 10.5 cm guns were removed, leaving her with a gun armament of just six weapons. The ship was decommissioned on 14 March 1917, after which she was disarmed completely and reduced to a barracks ship for the Torpedo Inspectorate. According to Hildebrand, Röhr, and Steinmetz, surviving records do not indicate whether she was based in Kiel or Wilhelmshaven, with I Torpedo Division or II Torpedo Division, respectively, but the naval historian Erich Gröner states that she was stationed in Kiel during this period. She served in this capacity through the end of the war in November 1918. =Later career= Amazone (left) alongside the heavy cruiser at the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg in 1939 The Treaty of Versailles that ended the war permitted Germany to retain six light cruisers, and Amazone was among those kept in service of the newly reorganized Reichsmarine. She was modernized and rearmed at the Reichsmarine Werft in Wilhelmshaven between 1921 and 1923. Her ram bow was replaced with a clipper bow, and she received a new battery of ten 10.5 cm SK L/45 guns in U-boat mountings and two torpedo tubes in deck launchers. She was recommissioned on 1 December 1923 under the command of Kapitän zur See (KzS—Captain at Sea) Walter Gladisch to replace her sister She joined the light forces of the Marinestation der Nordsee (North Sea Naval Station), operating with the light cruiser and II. Torpedo-boat Flotilla. She spent the year 1924 conducting training exercises and visits abroad, including a summer training cruise with the fleet to Bodø, Norway. In March 1925, KzS Eduard Eichel relieved Gladisch. Amazone repeated the same pattern of training with the fleet and visits to foreign ports that year, including a cruise to Rotterdam, Netherlands and fleet exercises in the Eidangerfjord in Norway from 25 June to 1 July. She went on a longer cruise to the Mediterranean Sea in May and June 1926, in addition to her normal training duties, and in September, FK Alfred Saalwächter took command of the ship. In 1927, she embarked on a major cruise into the Atlantic with the rest of the fleet, which lasted from 28 March to 16 June; in September, FK Albrecht Meißner took command of the vessel. During a visit to Norway in mid-1928 in company with the battleship , she stopped in Molde and Merok. Fleet maneuvers were thereafter held off Skagen, Denmark. Amazone largely remained in German waters in 1929 and saw little activity of note, apart from a trip to Gothenburg, Sweden in August. The Reichsmarine conducted a reorganization of the fleet on 1 January 1930, dividing the ships into tactical units. Amazone was initially assigned to the Reconnaissance Forces Command, under now-KAdm Gladisch, but it was quickly determined that she had little value as a warship by this point, some thirty years after her launch. She was accordingly decommissioned in Wilhelmshaven on 15 January and thereafter used as a barracks ship. She was then struck from the naval register on 31 March 1931 and assigned to the Submarine Acceptance Commission in Kiel. In addition to serving as a barracks, she was later used as an auxiliary for the Warship Construction Test Office. During World War II, she was towed to Bremen, and after the conflict she was used as an accommodation hulk for refugees who had fled from formerly-German occupied territories in eastern Europe. She lay idle and unused from 1951 to 1954, and plans to convert her into a floating youth center came to nothing. The old cruiser was ultimately broken up for scrap in 1954 in Hamburg; she was the last member of the Gazelle class to be scrapped.

The Gazelle class was the culmination of earlier unprotected cruiser and aviso designs, combining the best aspects of both types in what became the progenitor of all future light cruisers of the Imperial fleet. Built to be able to serve with the main German fleet and as a colonial cruiser, she was armed with a battery of ten guns and a top speed of . The ship spent the majority of her prewar career serving as a training ship, first with the Torpedo Inspectorate and then with the Naval Artillery Inspectorate. During this period, she also frequently escorted Kaiser Wilhelm II during cruises aboard his yacht, Hohenzollern to visit foreign countries. She was decommissioned in 1909 and remained out of service until August 1914, when World War I led to her reactivation to support coastal defense forces in the mouth of the Elbe river through late 1915. She was used as a barracks ship and stationary training ship for the rest of the war. Nymphe was one of the six cruisers Germany was allowed to keep in service by the Treaty of Versailles, and she was modernized in the early 1920s before being recommissioned in 1924. She served as the flagship of the fleet's light forces in the Baltic Sea through the 1920s, during which time she made two major training cruises into the Atlantic and the Mediterranean Sea. The ship was decommissioned in 1929 and employed as a barracks ship until 1931, when she was struck from the naval register and sold to ship breakers. She was dismantled in 1932 in Hamburg. Design Following the construction of the unprotected cruiser and the aviso for the German Kaiserliche Marine (Imperial Navy), the Construction Department of the Reichsmarineamt (Imperial Navy Office) prepared a design for a new small cruiser that combined the best attributes of both vessels. The designers had to design a small cruiser with armor protection that had an optimal combination of speed, armament, and stability, along with the endurance to operate on foreign stations in the German colonial empire. The resulting Gazelle design provided the basis for all of the light cruisers built by the German fleet to the last official designs prepared in 1914. Nymphe was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of forward. She displaced normally and up to at full combat load. Her propulsion system consisted of two triple- expansion steam engines manufactured by Germaniawerft. They were designed to give , for a top speed of . The engines were powered by ten coal-fired Marine- type water-tube boilers. Nymphe carried of coal, which gave her a range of at . She had a crew of 14 officers and 243 enlisted men. The ship was armed with ten SK L/40 guns in single mounts. Two were placed side by side forward on the forecastle, six were located amidships, three on either side, and two were placed side by side aft. The guns could engage targets out to . They were supplied with 1,000 rounds of ammunition, for 100 shells per gun. She was also equipped with two torpedo tubes with five torpedoes. They were submerged in the hull on the broadside. The ship was protected by an armored deck that was thick. The conning tower had thick sides, and the guns were protected by thick gun shields. Service history =Construction – 1904= Nymphe c. 1901–1904 Nymphe was ordered under the contract name \\"A\\" and was laid down at the Germaniawerft shipyard in Kiel in November 1898. She was launched on 21 November 1899, and the Bürgermeister (Mayor) of Lübeck gave a speech. After fitting-out work was completed, she was commissioned for sea trials on 20 September 1900. Her first commander was Kapitän zur See (KzS—Captain at Sea) Hugo Zeye. Her initial testing was interrupted in January 1901 when she was sent to escort Hohenzollern, the yacht of Kaiser Wilhelm II, during Wilhelm's visit to Britain for the funeral of his grandmother, Queen Victoria. Nymphe lay off Portsmouth from 26 January to 5 February, thereafter visiting Sheerness, Britain, and then Vlissingen, Netherlands. She arrived back in German waters on 8 February and resumed trials, which were completed the following month. She was then assigned to the Torpedo Inspectorate, which used her as a torpedo testing ship, a role Nymphe filled for the next four years. At the same time, Korvettenkapitän (KK—Corvette Captain) Georg Scheibel replaced Zeye. In June 1901, Nymphe again escorted Hohenzollern during the Kiel Week sailing regatta. She took part in the annual fleet training maneuvers held in August and September, which concluded with a naval review held while Tsar Nicholas II of Russia visited Germany. In October, KK Günther von Krosigk relieved Scheibel as the ship's commander. The year 1902 saw the ship escort Hohenzollern three times in addition to her torpedo testing duties: the first to Kiel Week in June, followed by a cruise to Norway in July; the second in August during a visit to Reval for another meeting with Nicholas, during which Nymphe and other German vessels took part in combined fleet maneuvers with elements of the Russian Baltic Fleet; the third on November for a visit to Britain for Wilhelm to visit his uncle, King Edward VII. Between the last two trips, Nymphe took part in the fleet maneuvers held in late August and early September, and Kapitänleutnant (KL—Captain Lieutenant) Albertus Petruschky briefly took command of the ship from September to October, followed by KK Voit. At the end of the year, her crew was temporarily reduced for periodic maintenance over the winter months. KL Wilibald Grauer briefly commanded the vessel from January to February, when he was replaced by Voit. Nymphe once again accompanied Hohenzollern that year during the Kaiser's visit to Copenhagen, Denmark, from 2 to 6 April to visit King Christian IX, again for that year's Kiel Week in June, and for Wilhelm's cruise to Norway in July. Nymphe arrived back in Swinemünde on 11 August and she then joined the fleet for the annual maneuvers held later that month and into September. As in the previous year, she spent the winter with a reduced crew undergoing repairs, now under KK Wilhelm Sthamer's command. In December, he was replaced by Grauer. After recommissioning in 1904, she embarked on a training cruise to Norwegian waters with the torpedo testing ship Neptun (the former armored frigate ) that lasted from 16 March to 3 April and included torpedo test firings. Nymphe took part in that year's fleet maneuvers as well, and in September, KK Leberecht Maass became the ship's captain. =1905–1914= Map of the North and Baltic Seas in 1911 On 11 January 1905, Nymphe was replaced as the primary torpedo testing ship by the new pre- dreadnought battleship , and on 30 March, Nymphe in turn relieved the old screw corvette . At the same time, KK Karl Behm became the ship's commander, serving until September that year. Nymphe was accordingly transferred from the Torpedo Inspectorate to the Naval Artillery Inspectorate, where she served for the next two years. She took part in her first set of exercises in the new unit in May 1905. She was present for the high seas regatta held between the island of Helgoland and Dover, Britain. From 1 to 7 August, she cruised with her sister ship and three old torpedo boats filled with cork for use as torpedo targets. In January 1906, Behm returned to the ship. Nymphe operated with the training vessels of the German fleet, now organized as the School and Testing Ships Unit, in April and May 1906. She reprised her participation in the Dover–Helgoland regatta that June. KK Heinrich Trendtel replaced now- Fregattenkapitän (FK—Frigate Captain) Behm. During exercises in the western Baltic Sea on 17 November, Undine collided with and sank the torpedo boat ; Nymphe assisted with the rescue effort for the torpedo boat's crew. Nymphe continued in her gunnery training duties, which included fleet shooting practice in April 1907 in the German Bight for the first time; up to that point, her training operations had been confined to the Baltic. She may have also taken part in fleet maneuvers in the area at that time. In May and June, she was dry-docked in the Kaiserliche Werft (Imperial Shipyard) in Wilhelmshaven to be rearmed. She retained six of her 10.5 cm guns, but the four on her starboard side were replaced with four guns and two guns to diversify the types of guns available for training. She was thereafter designated the \\"training ship for automatic weapons\\". The ship was recommissioned on 2 July; during the fleet maneuvers in August, she served with the temporarily created III (Maneuver) Squadron. While engaged in the maneuvers on 31 August, the coastal defense ship accidentally rammed Nymphe aft on her port side; Nymphe was forced to go to Kiel, where she was decommissioned on 19 September for repairs. After the work was completed, Nymphe was moved to Danzig without being recommissioned. Medusa, which had replaced Nymphe, was due for scheduled maintenance by early 1908, so Nymphe was recommissioned on 23 May to take her place, serving until February 1909. During this period, she was based at Sonderburg, until she was relieved by the newer cruiser . The ship was then decommissioned and placed in reserve, where she remained for the next five years. =World War I= Following the start of World War I in July 1914, Nymphe was recommissioned on 8 August to serve as the flagship of the harbor flotilla that guarded the mouth of the Elbe. Whether she received her original battery of ten 10.5 cm guns or retained her gunnery training ship armament is not known. The commander of the flotilla was FK Ernst Ewers, who also served as Nymphes captain. In January 1915, Ewers was replaced in both roles by FK Erich von Zeppelin. The ship saw little activity during this period, and in August 1915, Zeppelin left the ship, which was then removed from front-line service on 1 September. She thereafter was assigned to the Torpedo Inspectorate, reverting to her original role as a torpedo training ship. She served in this capacity until 1 November 1916, when she was decommissioned and then disarmed. She remained assigned to the Torpedo Inspectorate, which used her as a barracks ship and as a stationary training vessel. =Reichsmarine career= Nymphe was among the six light cruisers that Germany was permitted to retain under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles that ended the war. She was taken to Wilhelmshaven on 4 November 1920, where from November 1922 to early 1924 she was modernized at the Deutsche Werke shipyard. Her original ram bow was replaced with a modern clipper bow, which increased her overall length to . She also received a new mast, along with a new battery of 10.5 cm SK L/45 guns in U-boat mountings. A pair of torpedo tubes in deck-mounted launchers were also installed. She was recommissioned on 30 November 1924 for sea trials, with KzS Ernst Bindseil as her first commander in the new Reichsmarine (Navy of the Realm). She was then assigned to serve as the flagship of light Naval Forces of the Baltic Sea on 18 December, under the command of Konteradmiral (KAdm—Rear Admiral) Iwan Oldekop. FK Georg Kleine relieved Bindseil as the ship's commander in January 1925. In addition to routine training exercises that year, the ship visited Merok, Norway, from 25 to 30 June. KAdm Franz Wieting replaced Oldekop as the unit commander on 25 September. In 1926, Nymphe took part in a major training cruise into the Atlantic and the Mediterranean Sea, during which she made several stops in Spain, including Cadiz from 20 to 24 May, Mahón, Menorca, from 27 to 29 May, Málaga from 1 to 8 June, and Vigo from 12 to 13 June. After returning to Germany, she took part in the fleet maneuvers held in August. From 4 to 5 September, she visited Skagen, Denmark, after which FK Fritz Conrad replaced Kleine as the ship's captain. KzS Wilfried von Loewenfeld replaced Wieting on 16 March 1927. The ship made more foreign visits that year, and while in the Bay of Biscay, she was damaged in severe weather that saw wind strength in the range of 10–12 on the Beaufort scale. She stopped in El Ferrol from 2 to 14 April, Santa Cruz from 17 to 20 April, La Luz in Málaga from 24 April to 2 May, Lanzarote in the Canary Islands from 3 to 9 May, Horta and Ponta Delgada in the Azores from 14 to 23 May and from 24 to 29 May, respectively, Seville from 3 to 7 June, and Cadiz from 7 to 8 June. She once again took part in fleet maneuvers upon her return to Germany. Nymphe participated in a fleet cruise to Norway in July 1928, which included stops in Bergen and Ulvik. Following the fleet's return to Germany, it conducted another set of training exercises, and in September, FK Wolf von Trotha relieved Conrad, serving as the ship's last commander. On 15 October, KAdm Walter Gladisch replaced Loewenfeld, though Nymphe remained the flagship for just six months, being decommissioned on 16 April 1929 in Kiel; her role was taken by the new light cruiser . Nymphe was briefly retained as a barracks ship until 31 March 1931, when she was struck from the naval register. She was sold on 29 August and then broken up the following year in Hamburg.

Thetis was ordered to reinforce German forces in German East Africa after the outbreak of the Maji Maji Rebellion in mid-1905. The revolt was quickly suppressed and Thetis was thereafter recalled to Germany for an overhaul, after which she was placed in reserve. Thetis was recommissioned after the start of World War I, initially to patrol the Danish straits. She was soon transferred to the Detached Division for offensive operations against Russian forces, taking part in several patrols in the northern Baltic. During one of these operations in November 1914, she failed to report sighting Russian destroyers laying a minefield that sank a German armored cruiser two days later, leading to her commander being relieved of command. In 1915, she supported German Army operations in the area around the Gulf of Riga, ultimately being damaged by naval mines in the Battle of the Gulf of Riga in August. She was decommissioned for repairs and then served as a training ship for the rest of the war. As one of the six cruisers permitted for the post-war Reichsmarine (Navy of the Realm), Thetis returned to active service between 1922 and 1924. This period passed uneventfully, though she served as the flagship of light forces in the Baltic and she made several visits to foreign ports in the region.

Service history =Early career= Postcard depicting Thetis, c. 1902 Thetis was ordered under the contract name \\"C\\" and was laid down at the Kaiserliche Werft (Imperial Dockyard) in Danzig in September 1899 and was launched on 3 July 1900. At her launching ceremony the shipyard director, Konteradmiral (KAdm—Rear Admiral) Curt von Prittwitz und Gaffron, gave a speech and she was christened by Countess Amélie von Dohna-Schlobitten. After fitting-out work was completed, she was commissioned for sea trials on 14 September 1901. A month later, Korvettenkapitän (KK—Corvette Captain) Ernst van Semmern took command of the ship. On 1 December, she was assigned to join the East Asia Squadron. She passed through the Mediterranean Sea, transited the Suez Canal, and steamed into the Red Sea; Semmern had been secretly ordered by the Admiralstab (Admiralty Staff) to inspect the Farasan Islands to determine whether a coaling station could be built there. The nature of Semmern's report is not known, but Russian accusations that Germany sought to seize the islands led Germany to formally renounce the idea in 1902. After leaving the Red Sea, Thetis stopped in Aden, the British Aden Settlement, Colombo in British Ceylon, and Calcutta, India; while in Calcutta, she met the Austro-Hungarian protected cruiser . The two ships' officers met with the Swedish explorer Sven Hedin. Thetis then continued on, reaching Singapore on 7 February 1902. While in the East Asia Squadron, Thetis was based in Tsingtao. The commander of the squadron, Vizeadmiral (Vice Admiral) Richard Geissler, came aboard the ship for a cruise in the Yangtze river on 28 April. The ship visited Wusung, Nanking, and Hankou before returning to Tsingtao on 15 May. That year, Thetiss gunners earned the Schiesspreis (Shooting Prize) for the East Asia Squadron, awarded every year by Kaiser Wilhelm II. In December, Fregattenkapitän (FK–Frigate Captain) Karl Dick replaced Semmern as the ship's captain. The year 1903 passed uneventfully. After the outbreak of the Russo-Japanese War in February 1904, Thetis was sent to Chemulpo in the Korean Empire to evacuate German nationals from the country. From October to December, she embarked on another cruise in the Yangtze. In June 1905, FK Ludwig Glatzel became the ship's commander. Following the outbreak of the Maji Maji Rebellion against colonial rule in German East Africa in July, Thetis was detached from the East Africa Squadron to reinforce the colonial garrison, though she officially remained part of the unit. Thetiss crew again secured the Schiesspreis for the 1905 training year. She left Hong Kong on 28 August and arrived in East Africa on 26 September; the unprotected cruiser joined her there on 1 October. Since Glatzel was the senior-most captain of the vessels in the area, which also included the unprotected cruiser , the station ship in East Africa, he became the commander of the naval forces in the region. The rebellion was quickly suppressed, however, and by 30 December Glatzel reembarked Thetiss landing party. He reported to the Admiralstab on 2 January 1906 that Thetis and Seeadler were no longer required and the naval command concurred, though Thetis remained in Dar es Salaam until 29 March, when she was ordered to return to Germany. After arriving in Danzig, Thetis was decommissioned on 18 June for a major overhaul, after which she was placed in reserve for the next eight years. =World War I= Map of the North and Baltic Seas in 1911 1914 Following the start of World War I in July 1914, Thetis was recommissioned on 4 August and assigned to the Coastal Defense Division of the Baltic Sea, commanded by KAdm Robert Mischke. Work to ready the ship for wartime service was completed by 24 August, and she was thereafter deployed to patrol the Danish straits to guard against incursions by British warships. Thetis was transferred on 18 October to the Detached Division, commanded by KAdm Ehler Behring; the unit was tasked with offensive operations against Russian forces in the eastern Baltic. She took part in a sweep as far north as Gotska Sandön on 24–26 October before being sent with the 20th Torpedo-boat Half-flotilla to guard Memel against Russian attacks. She sent a landing party of seventy-four men to reinforce the defenses of Bajohren on 30–31 October. Thetis was thereafter recalled to Danzig. While on the way back on the night of 6 November, Thetiss crew observed a pair of ships in the distance, but her commander, FK Paul Nippe, failed to report the sighting. At around midnight, the cruiser engaged in a brief action with a Russian destroyer. Behring was harshly critical of Nippe's failure to inform him of the events and Behring's superior, Prince Heinrich of Prussia, who was the Oberbefehlshaber der Ostsee (Supreme Commander of the Baltic Sea) relieved Nippe of command. KK Walter Hildebrand then took command of the ship on 22 November. As it turned out, the vessels Thetis had observed were four Russian destroyers that had laid a minefield off Memel that claimed Behler's flagship, the armored cruiser , on 17 November. Behring led another sweep into the direction of the Åland Islands that lasted from 15 to 18 December; Thetis and the light cruiser screened the eastward flank by patrolling off Utö, protecting the main German element from being surprised by Russian vessels that might sortie from the Gulf of Finland. While on the way back, Thetis encountered the German auxiliary and did not recognize her in the darkness. She opened fire, prompting Senator Strandes to return fire, but Thetis quickly sank the auxiliary. On 26 December, she was temporarily transferred to V Battle Squadron to screen a sortie of the old pre-dreadnought battleships that advanced as far north as Gotland. The ships arrived back in port on 30 December and Thetis returned to the Detached Division. 1915 On 6 to 9 January 1915, Behring conducted another sweep to Utö, the harbor of which was being used by Russian submarines as an advance base. Since Thetis had the shallowest draft of any of the cruisers on the operation, she was selected to lead an attack on the port with several torpedo boats. Behring called off the attack, however, after determining the force was not strong enough to overpower the Russian defenses. Thetis was sent to the Kaiserliche Werft in Kiel for repairs from 20 January to 5 February. She then returned to the Detached Division, and Behring came aboard from 17 to 20 March for another sweep in company with the light cruiser . The ships patrolled north of Memel, where Russian naval forces were known to operate. Thetis remained in Memel for the next month and supported a minelaying operation off the island of Dagö in the Gulf of Riga. One of the Gazelle-class cruisers, possibly Thetis, in Kiel in 1901 On 20 April, the German naval command created a new command element in the Baltic: the Führer der Aufklärungsstreitkräfte in der östlichen Ostsee (Leader of Reconnaissance Fores in the Eastern Baltic), with KAdm Albert Hopman its first commander. Thetis was assigned to the unit. As the Central Powers prepared to launch the Gorlice–Tarnów Offensive in early May 1915, the extreme left flank of the German Army was ordered to launch a diversionary attack on 27 April. Thetis was assigned to the naval support for the attack; on the first day of the attack, she and Lübeck shelled the port of Libau. Thetis then patrolled off the entrance to the Irben Strait that led into the Gulf of Riga. On 7 May, the Army was poised to seize Libau, and so requested naval support for the attack. Thetis and several other cruisers and torpedo boats covered the assault on the city and patrolled to ensure no Russian naval forces attempted to intervene. On 12 May, a Russian submarine attacked Thetis twice, but failed to score any hits. On 14 May 1915, Thetis had taken the U-boat under tow off Bogskär island in the Gulf of Finland. The Russian submarine attacked the two German vessels, launching three torpedoes at Thetis and a fourth at U-4, all of which missed. From the recently captured naval base at Libau, the Germans began to make offensive operations further into the Baltic. On 3 June, Thetis, four torpedo boats, and a seaplane tender attempted to force the Irben Strait, where they intended to lay a minefield. Russian and British submarines intercepted the flotilla in the Strait, however. The Russian submarine Okun attempted to move into position to attack Thetis, but one of the torpedo boats spotted her periscope and forced it off. On 5 June, the British submarine arrived on the scene, by which time the German vessels had withdrawn to the western coast of Gotland. There, Thetis and the torpedo boats were resupplying from the collier . E9 launched a spread of torpedoes at the ships; the one fired at Thetis missed, but the collier was hit, as was the torpedo boat . The collier sank, but the torpedo boat survived and made it back to port. Another minelaying operation took place on 25–26 June; this time, Thetis escorted minelayers that laid a field in the Sea of Åland. Thetis again came under torpedo attack from an unknown submarine, though she was not hit. On 19 July, Thetis was based in Windau for a planned attack on the Gulf of Riga by elements of the High Seas Fleet. In August, Thetis was assigned to the fleet that was to break into the Gulf of Riga to support the German Army's attempt to capture the city. On 8 August, the Germans made their first attempt to force the Irben Strait, during which Thetis and the torpedo boat were damaged by mines. Thetis had to be towed back to Libau by minesweepers. The attack failed due to heavy Russian resistance, and the operation had to be postponed. In the meantime, while Thetis was in Windau, she underwent temporary repairs that allowed her to steam for Neufahrwassar on 21 August, proceeding then to Kiel, where she was decommissioned on 3 September in the Kaiserliche Werft for repairs. While out of service in 1917, Thetis was rearmed with nine newer 10.5 cm SK L/45 guns in U-boat mountings; in this configuration, Thetis was recommissioned on 19 October for use as a gunnery training ship. She served in this capacity for the next year of the war, which passed uneventfully for Thetis; no events of note were recorded. She was decommissioned again on 19 December 1918, following Germany's defeat the previous month. =Reichsmarine career= She was one of six light cruisers Germany was permitted to retain by the Treaty of Versailles that ended the war. Modernized in the early 1920s, she was recommissioned on 2 April 1922 and assigned to the Marinestation der Ostsee (Baltic Sea Naval Station). Her first commander during this period was FK Walther Kinzel. The year 1922 passed uneventfully, apart from routine training exercises with other elements of the small German fleet. In 1923, the ship made a pair of visits abroad; the first, to Mölle, Sweden, was from 11 to 15 July; the second, to Loen, Norway, lasted from 18 to 24 July. In October, Kapitän zur See (KzS—Captain at Sea) Ernst Bindseil replaced Kinzel. At the same time, the fleet was reorganized and Thetis became the flagship of light naval forces in the Baltic, which also included her sister ship and I Torpedo- boat Flotilla. The commander of the unit was KzS und Kommodore (and Commodore) Iwan Oldekop, who was promoted to konteradmiral on 1 November. Thetis made another pair of foreign visits in July 1924, both to ports in Estonia, one of the countries that had been created from the dissolution of the Russian Empire after the war. The first was to Tallinn (formerly Reval) from 5 to 10 July, and the second to Pärnu from 12 to 14 July. On 30 November, the ship was decommissioned in Wilhelmshaven, with her sister replacing her as flagship. The vessel was thereafter used as a barracks ship in Wilhelmshaven until early 1929; struck from the naval register on 27 March, she and the torpedo boats and were sold to Blohm & Voss. Thetis was broken up in Hamburg in 1930.

However, the commercial area of the passenger building is managed by Centostazioni. Train services are operated by Trenitalia. Each of these companies is a subsidiary of Ferrovie dello Stato (FS), Italy's state-owned rail company. Location Verbania-Pallanza railway station is situated in the Fondotoce district of Verbania. It is sandwiched between Lake Mergozzo and the river Toce, just upstream from where the Toce flows into Lake Maggiore. History The station was opened on 16 January 1905, together with the rest of the Arona–Domodossola section of the Milan–Domodossola railway. The composite name Verbania-Pallanza denotes the station's location within the borders of the former town of Pallanza, which, in 1939, was merged with Intra to form the current comune of Verbania. Features The station yard consists of three tracks. Two are operating lines, used by trains coming from the direction of Milan or from Domodossola, respectively. The third is currently not used. This configuration supports a smooth flow of passengers, primarily in the direction of Milan. As at January 2010, the station was not served by the EuroCity trains travelling between Milan and Domodossola.

From this report, all people would go to a secondary school. History The full title of the report was Secondary Education with special reference to Grammar Schools and Technical High Schools. The report was produced by Sir Will Spens CBE, the Master from 1927-52 of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. At the time of the report, around 5% of the British secondary school population would go on to university, but 50% of those at public school attended university. =Committees= The Spens Committee was given its task in the autumn of 1933. It sat for 76 days and examined 150 witnesses.British Journal of Educational Studies February 1977 Sub-committees sat for another 36 days. Sub-committees were set up to look into the grammar school curriculum in March 1935, and a drafting committee in February 1936. A Code Committee looked at the 1926 Hadow Report of Sir William Henry Hadow CBE, and how work from that would report would be included into the Spens Report. What was discussed in each committee, which would have a significant effect on British secondary education, and the committee's findings was dependent on the type of people, and their backgrounds, on each committee and who had appointed them. Content The Report was published on Friday 30 December 1938 by the Consultative Committee of the Board of Education. It concluded that the existing arrangements for the whole-time education of boys and girls in England and Wales have ceased to correspond with the actual structure of modern society and with the economic facts of the situation. The report was long and covered many areas, not just the implementation of grammar schools and technical schools. * It advocated the raising of the school age to 16, when financially possible. This was trailed in the 1944 Butler Education Act, but would not be implemented until September 1972. The 1936 Education Act had raised the leaving age (RSLA or ROSLA) to 15 from 1 September 1939, but this had been postponed. The 1964 Labour government planned to raise it to 16, but was prevented for economic reasons in 1968. When it was introduced in the early 1970s, the National Association of Schoolmasters forecast increased truancy, hooliganism and classroom revolt and opposed its introduction. * It proposed that the envisaged diverse secondary education system should maintain parity of conditions between the three types of school - modern, technical and grammar. * It advocated the abolition of school fees. Effect The most well known, although not immediate, effect of the report was the Education Act 1944, known as the Butler Act after the President of the Board of Education, Rab Butler (later Lord Butler of Saffron Walden). This largely implemented main portions of the Spens Report. A subsequent report in 1943, the Norwood Report of Sir Cyril Norwood, advocated grammar, technical and secondary modern schools.

Description The most detailed description of the pompa circensis during the Republican era is given by Dionysius of Halicarnassus, based on eyewitness observation and the historian Fabius Pictor,Dionysius of Halicarnassus, 7.72.1–13 = Q. Fabius Pictor, FRH2 1 frg. 20. who says he is describing the original Ludi Romani; Fabius may, however, have been more influenced by what he saw in the pompa of the Saecular Games in 249 BC. The procession was led by boys of the nobility (nobiles) riding on horseback, followed by boys on foot who were future infantrymen. Next came the charioteers and athletes who would compete in the games.H.S. Versnel, Triumphus: An Inquiry into the Origin, Development and Meaning of the Roman Triumph (Brill, 1970), pp. 96–97. Troops of dancers followed to musical accompaniment performed on auloi, a type of woodwind instrument, and the lyre. The dancers were divided into age classes, men, youths, and children. Wearing purple tunics, they wielded swords and short spears in war dances similar to the Cretan pyrrhics. The adult dancers also wore bronze helmetsVersnel, Triumphus, p. 97. with \\"conspicuous crests and wings.\\"W.J. Slater, \\"Three Problems in the History of Drama,\\" Phoenix 47.3 (1993), p. 202. A chorus dressed as satyrs and sileni followed the armed dancers and mocked them. They were costumed in woolly tunics, garlands of different kinds of flowers, and goatskin loincloths, with their hair standing out on their heads in tufts.Slater, \\"Three Problems,\\" p. 203. The appearance of satyristai at the original Ludi Romani is the earliest known reference to satyrs in Roman culture.T.P. Wiseman, \\"Satyrs in Rome? The Background to Horace's Ars Poetica,\\" Journal of Roman Studies 78 (1988), pp. 7. Although Dionysius suggests that both the war dances and the Bacchic dancing were in imitation of the Greeks, the armed dances had a Roman precedent in the Salian priests, who danced with sword and shield, and the role of the satyrs seems based on Etruscan custom.Wiseman, \\"Satyrs in Rome?\\" p. 11, note 86; Slater, \\"Three Problems,\\" p. 203. The procession concluded with men carrying golden bowls and perfumes, and then the statues of the gods carried on litters (fercula), with their attributes (exuviae) transported separately in special chariots or carts (tensae or thensae). The tensae were pulled by boys whose mothers and fathers were still alive.Versnel, Triumphus, pp. 98, 260. The images and exuviae were displayed at the circus, probably on the wooden platform called a pulvinar.Duncan Fishwick, \\"Prudentius and the Cult of Divus Augustus,\\" Historia 39.4 (1990), p. 481, citing Festus (500 in the edition of Lindsay). The procession started from the Capitolium, and through the clivus Capitolinus came to the Roman Forum. It then proceeded along the Via Sacra and passed through the Vicus Tuscus to arrive at the Circus Maximus.Patrizia Arena, \\"The pompa circensis and the domus Augusta (1st–2nd c. A.D.),\\" in Ritual Dynamics and Religious Change in the Roman Empire. Proceedings of the Eighth Workshop of the International Network Impact of Empire (Heidelberg, July 5–7, 2007) (Brill, 2009), p. 86. The magistrate who presided over the games rode in a two-horse chariot (biga) and wore the traditional attire of the triumphing general (triumphator).Versnel, Triumphus, pp. 102, 104, 129–130. It had been the view of Theodor Mommsen that the pompa circensis was simply a repurposing of the triumphal procession, to which the presenting of games had originally been attached. After ludi began to be presented apart from a triumph, the presiding magistrate took the place of the triumphator in the parade.As summarized by Versnel, Triumphus, p. 101f. H.S. Versnel considered the pompa to be a blend of Greek, Roman, and Etruscan elements.Versnel, Triumphus, p. 97. Frank Bernstein has argued that the tradition of Etruscan origin is essentially sound, and that the circus games and their opening procession were established during Rome's Regal period under the rule of Etruscan kings as part of the cult of the Capitoline Jupiter.Frank Bernstein, \\"Complex Rituals: Games and Processions in Republican Rome in A Companion to Roman Religion (Blackwell, 2007), p. 223ff. During the Empire The pompa circensis underwent a significant change during the dictatorship of Julius Caesar, when his image and chariot were added to the procession. During the reigns of Augustus and Tiberius, other members of the imperial family were represented by images and sellae (special \\"seats\\" or thrones; see curule chair). It then became customary in the 1st century to have the images of the emperor's family join those of the deities.Patrizia Arena, \\"The pompa circensis and the domus Augusta (1st–2nd c. A.D.),\\" in Ritual Dynamics and Religious Change in the Roman Empire. Proceedings of the Eighth Workshop of the International Network Impact of Empire (Heidelberg, July 5–7, 2007) (Brill, 2009), p. 78ff. By the time of Tiberius, the parade route had incorporated the Temple of Mars Ultor, built by Augustus, which had absorbed several ceremonies formerly held at the Temple of Capitoline Jupiter. The new extended route would have passed along the Forum of Augustus.Arena, \\"The pompa circensis,\\" p. 86. The priesthood of the Arval Brothers carried out a sacrifice when these ludi circenses were held in conjunction with various celebrations of Imperial cult. Until the reign of Nero, the Arval sacrifices were made on the Capitolium, where the procession traditionally began. In the early Empire, however, the Arvals made their sacrifices at the new Temple of the Divine Augustus on the occasion of ludi Martiales, ludi Augustales, and Augustus's birthday. At these times, the procession began there. The topography covered by the parade route might vary according to the desired symbolism for the occasion.Arena, \\"The pompa circensis,\\" p. 87ff. A more traditional parade route was restored under the Flavian dynasty. The Capitolium was again the focus, and the temples most explicitly connected to the Julio-Claudians were less central, though the images of the imperial family continued to be displayed. The route was expanded to pass along the Campus Martius in the time of Domitian, who had built a grand temple to the divinized Vespasian and Titus there. During the 2nd century, the route of the pompa circensis had probably become more similar to that of the triumph.Arena, \\"The pompa circensis,\\" pp. 91–92. The pompa circensis thus developed as a highly visible medium for expressing the new political and religious order of the Empire.Arena, \\"The pompa circensis,\\" pp. 92–93.

Sawada beach on Shimoji island. The rocks are believed to be remnants of the tsunami Earthquake analysis According to the Japanese government publication Rika-Nenpyō (理科年表) or Chronological Scientific Tables, the epicenter was 40 km south-southeast of Ishigaki Island with a magnitude of 7.4. According to the Mamoru Nakamura Laboratory, University of the Ryukyus, the earthquake was due to the activity of the fault east of Ishigaki and it is estimated that the magnitude was 7.5. Further simulation led to the activity of faults in the Ryukyu oceanic trench and the magnitude was 8.0. Also, there is a hypothesis that claims the magnitude was 8.5. The depth was . This trench lies between the Philippine Sea Plate and the Eurasian Plate. The disparity in the amount of recorded shaking (maximum 4 JMA) and the size of the tsunami has led to the interpretation of this event as a tsunami earthquake. Damage =Earthquake= It is considered that the earthquake registered an intensity of 4 (on the Japanese scale) in the Yaeyama Islands, and the damage by the earthquake was not as serious as the tsunami. =Tsunami= The dead and missing amounted to 12,000 people, and more than 2,000 houses were destroyed on Ishigaki and Miyakojima. It has been estimated Agriculture was severely damaged because of sea water invasion and the population decreased to about one third of what it was before the earthquake. On Ishigaki island, the run-up was first estimated around 40 to 80 meters high from historical documents. However, taking into account the rough precision of the measuring instruments at this time and considering geomorphological parameters, the maximal run-up has been re-estimated to ~30m. Following the tsunami, the damage it caused was such that it led to a famine that lasted for 80 years.  Boulders  Ishigaki takakoruse ishi, boulder dragged on land by the tsunami.

Biography Anderson was born in Edinburgh 10 December 1805. His father was supervisor of excise at Oban, and his mother the daughter of John Williams, author of the ‘Natural History of the Mineral Kingdom.’ He was thus a younger brother of John Anderson (genealogist, 1789-1832), the historian of the house of Hamilton. After receiving a good education in Edinburgh he became clerk to a Leith merchant, but subsequently entered a lawyer's office in Edinburgh. At an early period he began to contribute to the newspapers, and in 1830 published a volume of verse, entitled ‘Poetical Aspirations,’ which reached a second edition in 1833. This was followed by a volume of prose and verse, entitled ‘Odd Sketches.’ After a short residence in London in 1831 he obtained a situation on the ‘Aberdeen Journal.’ In 1836 he returned to London, where he formed a rather extensive literary connection, and in 1839 brought out the ‘Gift of all Nations,’ an annual which numbered among its contributors Thomas Campbell, Sheridan Knowles, the Countess of Blessington, and Miss Pardoe. In the same year he also published ‘Landscape Lyrics,’ which reached a second edition in 1854. In 1842 he became editor of the ‘Western Watchman,’ a weekly newspaper published at Ayr; in 1844 he was chosen subeditor of the ‘Edinburgh Witness,’ which, although the articles of Hugh Miller had secured it a wide circulation, had hitherto been subedited in a very perfunctory manner; and in 1845 he became the chief subeditor of the ‘Glasgow Daily Mail,’ the first daily newspaper published in Scotland. On account of the serious effects on his health of severe night labour, he was two years afterwards compelled for a time to abandon literary work, and he never formed any subsequent connection with a newspaper. With the exception of a volume of ‘Poems’ published in 1845, and the ‘Young Voyager,’ 1855, a poem descriptive of the search after Sir John Franklin, and intended for juvenile readers, the remaining works of Anderson are of the nature chiefly of popular compilations. They include an edition of the ‘Works of Lord Byron,’ with a life and notes, 1850; the ‘Poems and Songs of R. Gilfillan,’ with a memoir, 1851; and a ‘Treasury’ series, embracing the ‘Treasury of Discovery,’ 1853; of the ‘Animal World,’ 1854; of ‘Manners,’ 1855; of ‘History,’ 1856; and of ‘Nature,’ 1857. Of a somewhat higher character than these compilations are the ‘Scottish Nation,’ 1859–63, an expansion of his ‘Popular Scottish Biography’ published in 1842; and ‘Genealogy and Surnames,’ 1865. The ‘Scottish Nation,’ though diffuse and ill arranged, displays great industry and a minute acquaintance with Scottish family history; while ‘Genealogy and Surnames,’ amid much that is commonplace, contains some curious information not easily accessible elsewhere. He died suddenly at London 2 August 1866.

Biography  Michel Rateau began studying solfège and piano at the age of five at Notre Dame de France in Vanves, France. At the same age, he composed his first work in his parent's kitchen using everyday objects. Rateau attended a number of music courses throughout his childhood, studying under Sister Marie-Laurent up to the age of 11; then taking private piano courses with the organist Jean Boguet up to the age of 15. He then attended the classes of Jacques Février and Jean Doyen. Attracted to Composition, Rateau enrolled in the Conservatoire de Paris in 1959. He attended the classes of André Jolivet and Jean Rivier and begin studying under the supervision of the CNSM Professor of Harmony, Maurice Duruflé. He passed the Musical Education, CAPES (upper national teaching diploma) in 1960 and carried out National Military Service in the Band of the 93rd Infantry Regiment at Mont Valerien from 1962 to 1964. Rateau was awarded the First Prize of Harmony in 1963 and the First Prize of Composition in 1966 from Paris CNSM. In 1967 he won Premier Grand Prix de Rome, a French national upper artistic award allowing the winner to spend time at the Villa Medici in Rome, Italy. Rataeu lived at the Villa Medici from 1968 to 1971. Shortly after his return to Paris, he turned his focus to sounds emitted by unconventional instruments (such as bird cage, pipes, and tanks) and recorded them on magnetic tapes. This led to the score of “’La Course’” (The race) a ballet for the Paris Théâtre National Populaire (TNP) performed by Joseph Russillo’s company and a concert at the Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris within the frame of the A.R.C. (Animation, Research, Confrontation) ordered by Maurice Fleuret. Throughout these years, Rateau continued to compose orchestral scores. In 1976, Rateau settled in Rouen, and resumed his teaching activities at the Rouen IUFM (Institut Universitaire de Formation des Maîtres – i.e. University Institute for Teachers' Training). He also taught at the Rouen Institute of Musicology from 1980 to 1989 and at the École Normale de Musique de Paris from 1983 to 1990, as a teacher of harmony and analysis. In 1982 Rateau started the “Chants du Temps” (Time songs) for orchestra which he finished in 1988. While teaching full-time, he had “Offrande Lyrique” (Lyrical offering) for violin and orchestra played in concert at the Salle Gaveau in Paris in 1984 by l'Ensemble Orchestral de Paris (The Paris orchestral group) conducted by Jean-Pierre Wallez with Gaëtane Prouvost as a solo violin. To his joy, Maestros Olivier Messiaen and Henri Dutilleux attended this concert. The Rouen Chamber Orchestra played this work again in 1984, conducted by Jean- Pierre Berlingen. For the 25th anniversary of Rouen University in 1991, he composed a “quatre” for flute, clarinet, violin and piano for the Nouvel ensemble Contemporain (The New Contemporary group), created in concert in 1991. In 1992 Rateau began “Les Chants du Temps” for the piano, his Journal Musical (Musical Diary), “a work in progress of unachievement”. “Chants du Temps” returned to a very simple, quite purified, strongly melodic, and contrapuntal form of writing, which contrasts radically with the pioneering pieces he wrote in 1960-1970. It consists of a modulable composition in fifteen volumes, each volume enclosing twelve books and,each book containing twelve pages of music. Like a collection of poems, according to his mood and his preferences, the reader-interpreter will choose pieces to be read or played without restraint. Part of the “Chants du Temps” was played in concert at the University of Strasbourg in April 2005, on the occasion of the Cultural Action Days. The Israeli pianist Gilead Mishory has played some extracts of this work in concert in Germany and Japan.

She sank off Mott Island near Isle Royale in Lake Superior in 1885 and some of her remains are still on the lake bottom. The wreck was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. History Algoma (Official #85766) was built in 1883 by Aitken & Mansell in Glasgow, Scotland, for use by the Canadian Pacific Railway Company. Algoma was long, with a beam, a depth of , and had a gross register tonnage of 1,750 tons as originally built. It was powered by a compound steam engine driving a single screw, and had two masts in case of an engine breakdown. The ship was designed to accommodate 240 first-class passengers and 500 in steerage. Canadian Pacific ordered three ships from Aitken & Mansell: Athabasca, launched on July 3, 1883; Alberta, launched on July 12, and Algoma, launched on July 31. The three ships were identical. The company intended to use the ship as a passenger vessel on the Great Lakes, running from Thunder Bay on Lake Superior to Owen Sound on Lake Huron. Alberta and Algoma sailed from Glasgow on September 25, taking 13 days to cross the Atlantic and arrive in Montreal, Quebec. However, ships of Algomas size were too long to pass through the Welland Canal, so Algoma was cut in half, with the bow and stern moved through the canal separately on pontoons. The ship was rejoined in Buffalo, New York, and cabins were added, increasing the tonnage to 1,773 tons. Additional work was done on the cabins during the winter of 1883–1884, including the installation of electric lighting; Algoma and its sister ships were probably the first Great Lakes ships to be electrified. The newly outfitted Algoma, costing a total of $450,000 to build, was relaunched on May 11, 1884. The three Canadian Pacific steamers immediately set time records for their runs. Algoma clocked 39 hours, 42 minutes on the run between Owen Sound and Thunder Bay, and journeyed from Toronto to Thunder Bay in the \\"unprecedented short time of 47 hours.\\" There was some concern that the new steamers were disregarding safety to minimize their run times; indeed, Alberta was involved in a collision with the steam barge John M. Osborn in July 1884 near Whitefish Point which resulted in the loss of three lives. Wreck of Algoma The wreck of Algoma On November 5, 1885, Algoma left Owen Sound for Thunder Bay, carrying general merchandise, railway supplies, and 37 passengers, the fewest it had ever carried. This was likely attributable to the lateness of the season and the recent opening of a rail route around Lake Superior. The ship passed into Lake Superior on November 6; when it was about halfway across the lake it ran into a blinding snowstorm. The sails were set to stabilize the ship, but it drifted off course. At about 4 am on the morning of November 7, the captain ordered the sails lowered and changed course. At 4:40 am, shortly after resuming steam power, Algoma ran aground on the southeast shore of Mott Island off Isle Royale. The ship was grounded so that the waves pummeled the bow section. At about 6 am, the ship broke in two, with the stern grounded on the shore and the bow drifting off. Many of the passengers and crew were swept away, but three people made it to shore (only away) and another 11 remained in the bow section of the ship until the morning of November 8, when the storm abated. The survivors all got to shore on November 8, and stayed that night with a party of fishermen. On November 9, Athabasca was intercepted and the survivors were taken on to Thunder Bay. The Algoma wreck Forty-six people died in the wreck of Algoma; there were 14 survivors, including two passengers, 11 crewmen and the captain. A search party returned to Isle Royale on November 10, but found only two bodies; more bodies and cargo were located in the subsequent months. The force of the storm was such that nearly all the cargo was smashed; only portions of some bodies were found as the waves had \\"dashed them to pieces against the rocks\\", and some hull sections were completely flattened. The wreck of Algoma was the worst loss of life in the history of Lake Superior shipping. Much of the stern of the ship was salvaged in 1886, and much of the bow was either salvaged or drifted away. The engine from the ship was used in the passenger steamer Manitoba, launched in 1889; Manitoba was used for 60 years on the Great Lakes before decommissioning. An additional salvage operation was carried out in 1903. The wreck today The remaining wreckage is widely scattered in of water, and some portions of the stern are all that remain on the site. The wreckage near shore is primarily distributed in three fields, 100 feet apart. Various pieces of the ship's equipment, including pieces of a mast, pipes, valves, and davits are visible, as well as passenger artifacts. Much of the wreckage is in relatively shallow water, and lake action regularly rearranges the artifacts visible. A few pieces of wreckage have been located far offshore in deeper water; these may be from the missing bow section. Algoma is the least-visited wreck in the Isle Royale National Park, with approximately 10 dives in 2009 out of 1,062 dives made to wrecks in the park.

It stretches along Main Street, with extensions along Springfield Road and Battle Street, and includes a significant number of vernacular Federal and Greek Revival houses. It includes the town's early churches, as well as important civic buildings, including the town hall and library. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. Description and history The area that is now Somers was settled in the 17th century as part of Agawam Plantation (now Springfield, Massachusetts). It was separately incorporated out of Enfield in 1734, with jurisdiction transferred to the Connecticut Colony in 1749. The town has been primarily agricultural for much of its history, although there was a mill village at Somersville. The town flourished first with fruit production and then with tobacco and dairy production in the 19th century. The town center, located at the junction Main Street (Connecticut Route 190) with Springfield and South Streets (Connecticut Route 83), has been its civic and social center throughout. Important buildings, including early churches and schools, were located here, and the placement of similar buildings later has reinforced its importance in this role. The historic district is in size, and stretches along Main Street, with extensions along Springfield Road and Battle Street. Most of the buildings are early 19th-century residences, with Federal or Greek Revival style, although there are a selection of later 19th century styles represented as well. The older properties are largely clustered in three places: on Springfield Road near Main, the eastern end of Main Street, and the area just west of where the modern (1950) town hall stands. and See also *Somersville Historic District, also NRHP-listed in Somers *National Register of Historic Places listings in Tolland County, Connecticut References Somers, Connecticut Greek Revival architecture in Connecticut Colonial architecture in Connecticut Federal architecture in Connecticut Historic districts in Tolland County, Connecticut National Register of Historic Places in Tolland County, Connecticut Historic districts on the National Register of Historic Places in Connecticut ","title":"Somers Historic District"},{"id":"30089542","text":"Percy Borucki (born 22 July 1929) is a German fencer.

Casting off generally begins by counting the words or characters in the manuscript, usually using a word processor or text editor. This word count is then divided by an estimate of the number of words or characters per full page of a model book, i.e., a previously published book with approximately the same trim size and type specifications to be applied to the manuscript. The editor must then account for anything else that will add pages to the finished book, such as half-title and title pages, the copyright page, part-title pages, chapter openers, photographs, illustrations, charts, tables, or lines of poetry. In addition, the editor must anticipate any elements that will be added later in proofs, such as a preface or index. Once the editor has estimated the pages required to typeset the book, it must be rounded to the nearest multiple of sixteen (a signature) or eight (a half-signature) by adding blank pages or killing (editing so as to remove) pages. Editors tend to round up rather than down, because if the book requires more pages than anticipated, it will cost more to produce, but fewer pages and therefore lower production costs are less problematic. While some software exists to help editors in accurately casting off manuscripts, even an experienced editor often can't foresee the many variables that will affect a book's length, some of which may not arise until the book is well into production.

Early years Shena Dorothy Potter was born on 21 October 1883, daughter of John Wilson Potter and Jane Boyd Potter. She had a privileged upbringing in a liberal, upper middle class family. Although she studied at Newnham College, Cambridge and then the London School of Economics, she was not granted a formal degree since the University of Cambridge did not grant full membership to women until 1946. In 1911, Shena Potter became secretary of a committee for safeguarding women's rights under David Lloyd George's insurance bill. She was introduced to Ernest Simon by Sydney and Beatrice Webb, who thought she would make an ideal wife for him. Ernest was the son of Henry Simon, a wealthy Victorian industrialist. Shena married him in 1912, and they were to have two sons, Roger and Brian, and a daughter, Antonia. Career Simon founded the Women Citizens' Association in Manchester, a local branch of the National Women Citizens' Association. Her husband was Lord Mayor of Manchester from 1921 to 1922. As Lady Mayoress, Simon caused a stir by refusing to attend a function at St Mary's Hospital for Women because there were no women on the Board or among the medical staff. Shena Simon was a member of the Manchester City Council from 1924 to 1933, when she was voted out by the Conservatives. She was a member of the Royal Committee on Licensing in 1929 and a member of the Manchester Estate Council from 1931 to 1933. In 1926, Shena and Ernest Simon donated the Wythenshawe Park to the city of Manchester for use of the people living on the Wythenshawe estate. She felt that parks were important, and later was to observe that there was a severe shortage of such open space in Manchester. She devoted much energy to planning the Wythenshawe housing estate, but her recommendations were not always practical. For example, she fought for glazing bars in windows since they would make the housing more cottage-like in appearance, although the windows would be harder to clean. She accepted the conventional division of labour between men and women, at least for the working classes, where the woman minded the home. She became Chairperson of the Education Committee 1932–1933. From 1933 she was actively involved in the Spens Report on secondary education reform, serving as a representative of the Local Education Authorities. On the committee she argued forcefully for abolition of fees in secondary schools, although she could not always get her way. In 1933 Simon, her husband and Eva Marian Hubback co- founded the Association for Education in Citizenship. Her husband was knighted in 1932. He became chairman of the council of Victoria University of Manchester in 1939, was a sponsor of construction of the Jodrell Bank Observatory, and from 1947 to 1952 was chairman of the BBC. Lady Simon became a member of the Labour Party in 1935, and was appointed to the Departmental Committee on Valuation of Dwelling Houses in 1938. She was Chair of the Further Education Sub-Committee for seven years. In 1946 she became Chair of the Education Advisory Committee of the Workers Educational Associations. In 1964 she was made a freeman of the city. Speaking at that occasion, she said: ::\\"Happiness, a much more fundamental conception than mere enjoyment or pleasure, depends upon the existence of life and liberty, but it cannot be pursued by the individual unless he has had a chance to develop, first as a child, and then as an adult, all his interests and faculties, varied as they are between each member of society. I do not for a moment suggest that we are even yet in sight of that goal, but that it must be our \\"guiding light\\" has been my belief for the forty years that I have been a member of the Education Committee\\". Shena Simon died on 17 July 1972. The Shena Simon campus, later the Shena Simon Sixth Form College of The Manchester College is named after her. Publications Shena Simon was co-author with her husband Ernest Simon, William Alexander Robson and John Jewkes of the 1937 book Moscow in the Making. In 1939 Shena Simon published her book A Hundred Years of City Government, Manchester 1838–1938. She was also the author of several pamphlets on education. For example, in 1944 she published The four freedoms in secondary education. The Fabian Society published her pamphlet on The Education Act, 1944,: Provisions and possibilities in 1945. Her pamphlet Three Schools or One? (1948) called for establishment of multilateral or comprehensive schools.

She was sent to the countryside in as an \\"educated youth\\" at seventeen and started writing poetry. In 1977, she passed the college entrance exams and went to Wuhan University to study library science from 1978 to 1982. After graduation, Lin Bai first worked as a librarian in Guangxi Provincial Library. From 1985 to 1990, she worked in Guangxi Film Studio as an editor and screenwriter. She migrated to Beijing in the early 1990s to work for the newspaper Chinese Cultural Forum. In the early 1990s she married a senior cultural official and together had a daughter in 1991. They marriage later ended in divorce. She now works at home as a full- time writer. A War of One's Own A War of One's Own, sometimes known as A Self at War and published in 1994, is an autobiographical novel that caused a lot of controversy for its sexual openness. Some critics decried the book as pornography when it was released. It is based on her own life as a young writer moving from an outlying provincial town (Beiliu) to Beijing. The story opens with a young girl, Duomo, masturbating. The book is often compared with Chen Ran's A Private Life for their similar themes. Writing career and reception Although she began writing poems, she is primarily known as a fiction writer who draws heavily on personal experience. Many of Lin Bai's works explore the problems that face women in maturity. Women's sexual identity and private experiences, such as masturbation, lesbian relationships, abortion, adultery, and narcissistic self-love feature in many of her works. In the cultural market of 1990s China, Lin Bai's work enjoyed commercial success but also suffered from reductive reading, both because of its \\"sexual appeal\\" and bowdlerization by its publishers. A War of One's Own, for example, has been crudely edited to emphasize its sexual content, and several editions now circulate.

Although he returned to Luxembourg in 1924, he continued to exhibit in Munich until 1932 as a result of the negative criticism his nude paintings received in his home town.

The same year, he became a founding member of the avant- garde Luxembourg secession movement, exhibiting at its salon in 1927.\\"Joseph Kutter\\", Luxemburger Lexikon, Editions Guy Binsfeld, Luxembourg, 2006. He also continued to exhibit regularly at the Salon d'automne in Paris. His abilities were widely recognized in France and Belgium, much less so in Germany. In 1933, he ceased exhibiting in Germany after being considered a degenerate as Hitler gained power. In 1936, he was commissioned to paint two large works of \\"Luxembourg\\" and \\"Clervaux\\" for the French International Exposition.\\"L'illustration. - Exposition internationale de Paris. 95e année. N° 4917. 28 mai 1937\\". Retrieved 17 December 2010. While he was working on them, he began to suffer from a painful disease which the doctors were unable to diagnose. Later, during his better periods, he painted his clowns which reveal his suffering and anxiety. He died on 2 January 1941 in Luxembourg City. Style In Kutter's paintings, the subjects often stand in the foreground as if being photographed. His portraits, painted with strong brushstrokes, typically show figures with excessively large noses, always attracting attention.\\"The Champion: (Joseph Kutter - 1894-1941)\\" , P&T; Luxembourg. Retrieved 15 December 2010. From 1918, Kutter's paintings increasingly began to present Expressionist motifs, especially in his landscapes and floral works where intense lines and colours became prominent. Although Kutter spent a number of years in Germany, his work was influenced above all by trends in France and Belgium. His centre of attention was the human figure. He often represented his subjects as sad, despairing clowns.\\"Kutter and European Expressionism\\", Artline.ro. Retrieved 15 December 2010. The two large paintings (of Luxembourg City and Clervaux) he was commissioned to paint for Luxembourg's pavilion at the 1937 World Exposition in Paris are excellent examples of his maturing Expressionist style. In his painting of \\"Luxembourg\\" (above), his view of the city accentuates the stacked terracing of the houses, emphasizes the cubic appearance of the buildings, bestows a harsh appearance on the defensive walls and brings out the strength of the fortifications.Georgette Bisdorff, \\"Joseph Kutter\\" , Ons stad, No 73, 2003, p. 36.

Much of his artistic output has been generated with the use of contributed artefacts and materials. He states that through this process \\"contributor, artist and viewer come closer together\\". His art is influenced by the development of consumerism, technology, identity and cyberculture in society, with a distinctive focus on obsolete media. Drawing on recycled and obsolete technological materials as the grounds for his paintings, London-based artist Nick Gentry creates a conversation between digital and analog processes. Gentry constructs his painting supports out of materials such as film negatives, VHS cassettes, X-rays, and floppy disks. \\"These objects are no longer in the spotlight,\\" the artist has said of floppy disks, \\"but by placing them there for a second it becomes easier to comprehend the speed and extent of the changes that are taking place today.\\" Gentry often incorporates elements of these materials into his figures. The magnetic circles of floppy disks, for example, often serve as eyes in his portraits. He tries to avoid identifying age, gender and race and said his portraits are 'like a void to be filled' which enable people to bring their own identities to his work. Such artistic works of social commentary have been featured in galleries in the UK, USA and in cities throughout the world. His work has been exhibited alongside established contemporary Young British Artists Mark Quinn, Damien Hirst, and Tracey Emin and also with notable street artists, such as Banksy, Shepard Fairey and Blek le Rat. As a result, he has been linked with both the Contemporary art and Urban art scenes in London.  Early life  Nick Gentry was born in Hampstead, London and grew up in the nearby market city of St Albans. He spent much of his childhood drawing and sketching. He attended Parmiter's School in Garston, Hertfordshire. He continued to study art at Ridge Street Art School and the University of Hertfordshire. During this time he was inspired by a visit to the exhibition Sensation at the Royal Academy of Art, signalling the arrival of the Young British Artists. He was later refused admission to Liverpool College of Art when he first applied, but attended the college after a subsequent application a year later. From there he progressed to graduate from Central Saint Martins in London in 2006.  Works  Nick Gentry Digital Montage Number 2.  Film Negative and X-ray Artworks  A series of portraits created from used film negatives and X-rays which have been contributed by members of the public. The negative selection process is based on tone and by layering the film he creates the contrast and shape of the faces. Gentry has also used X-rays for the darker tones, noticeably in the hair section of the images which are back lit with LED. The use of these materials alludes to a collective identity that can be viewed from both emotional and biological perspectives. He observes that \\"today we go to great lengths to create a digital identity in addition to the actual lives we live, with the belief that these online records are only growing in importance and will outlive us\\".  Floppy Disk Paintings  A series of Generation X portraits on canvases made from used computer disks, whose metal hub serves as the subject's profoundly un-humanlike eye. Adding to his haunting renderings are the handwritten labels, along with the disks' original blue, black, or grey colour contributing to the composite form. The disks are sourced entirely from public donation and this series represents Gentry's first foray into what has been described as 'social art'.  Sculptures and Public Displays  From 29 June until 6 September 2015 a commissioned sculpture by Gentry was publicly displayed in the Barbican Centre in London. Inspired by the Nucleic acid double helix form, a series of 21 giant sculptures were customised by artists and designers including Ai Weiwei and Zaha Hadid. The sculptures were auctioned at Christie's on 30 September 2015 to raise funds for Cancer Research UK and to help complete the construction of the Francis Crick Institute, a new biomedical research facility at London’s King’s Cross. In the summer of 2018 Gentry created a rhino sculpture as part of the Tusk Rhino Trail. The project aimed to draw attention to the severe threat of poaching to the rhino. Each of the 21 rhinos were customised by artists such as Gavin Turk, David Mach and Marc Quinn. The works of art were put on public display at iconic London sites before being auctioned by Christie’s, raising funds for Tusk Trust conservation projects protecting rhino and other African species.  Collaborations  In June 2017 Gentry was one of six international artists invited to participate in a collaboration with World Wide Fund for Nature and Tiger Beer in an effort to highlight the harmful effects of illegal tiger trade, a cause of the shrinking tiger population. Gentry visited the Mondulkiri Protected Forest in Cambodia in search of wild tigers, but thanks to poaching, there has been no sighting of tigers for the past decade. Instead, he only saw animal snares. \\"It’s 8,000 sq km of forest and it was once perfect for tigers, there are more (tigers) in captivity than in the wild now.\\" recalled Gentry. Supporters uploaded selfies, then created and shared AI-generated artworks using one of the six artists' tiger-themed artworks. The images symbolise pledgers' collective fight against illegal tiger trade. The physical artworks were displayed at Clarke Quay Singapore and the interactive showcase travelled to various cities worldwide.  Street Artworks  Little is known about the street activity of Gentry. In earlier years before gallery representation the artist would often leave paintings in the streets for passers-by to pick up as gifts. This 'free art' practice draws comparison to the early activity of fellow London-based artist Adam Neate.  Career  In 2010 Gentry's first show took place in a small studio space in Soho, London at Studio55 Gallery. The show was titled Auto-Emotion and consisted of a series of floppy disk portraits. At the end of the year, Gentry took up a two-month art residency at Pantocrator Gallery in Barcelona, Spain. The residency culminated in a solo exhibition and live performance by Petra Flurr and Lola Von Dage. In 2011 Gentry had his first solo exhibition in the US at Robert Fontaine Gallery in Miami. Later that year Gentry had a solo exhibition at Whisper Gallery in London, titled Dataface. Selfridges featured a pop-up show of Gentry's works, titled Artefacts. Members of the public were invited to donate their obsolete technology to contribute to future artworks by the artist. In 2012 Gentry took part in a large scale urban art group show titled Urban Masters, in an East London warehouse. This was followed by a second solo show at Robert Fontaine Gallery titled Collective Memory. In 2013 a group show titled The Many Faces of David Bowie took place at Opera Gallery in London, UK. Gentry created a replica of Bowie's red Fender guitar using original film negatives of David Bowie, although it remains unknown if the negatives were contributed by Bowie himself. This was followed by a third solo exhibition at Robert Fontaine Gallery in Miami. The show was titled X-Change, heavily featuring the film negative and X-ray works for the first time. In 2014 Gentry appeared in the BBC Two documentary Making Art Work. Sitting in his studio surrounded by his artwork, Gentry explains how he re-uses outdated technology to create his artwork. He references inspiration by Marcel Duchamp and old footage of Duchamp’s work of a urinal is shown. He explains that Duchamp placed this object in a gallery and called it art, therefore artists should not be restricted by materials such as canvas but feel free to re-use materials. In November Gentry had a fourth solo exhibition at Robert Fontaine Gallery titled Synthetic Daydreams which consisted of works using 35mm film negatives. Gentry also took part in his first group show in New York at C24 Gallery. The show was titled YELL-O and also featured the work of Hellbent (J. Mikal Davis), Adele Mills and Ekaterina Panikanova. Gentry's work featured for the first time in Hong Kong at the group exhibition Urban Renewal at Opera Gallery alongside artists Seo Young-Deok, Olivier Dassault and Yves Krief. In April 2015 Gentry had his first solo exhibition in Knokke, Belgium at Absolute Art Gallery. The show was titled Memoryscapes and featured a series of the lightbox film negative works. In the summer of 2016 Gentry had his debut New York solo show at C24 Gallery. The exhibit, which marked his debut with the gallery, explored human connectedness, remembrance and nostalgia within the unrelenting, digitally oversaturated world of the present. The works, which mostly feature ethereal humanlike subjects, are constructed from sourced materials made by donors from around the globe that piece together a psychologically compelling narrative of human solidarity. In November and December Gentry's work was exhibited alongside a selection of rare works by Young British Artists Mark Quinn, Damien Hirst, and Tracey Emin at Opera Gallery in London. The show, titled 'BritARTnia' also presented the work of internationally established artists such as Julian Opie of the New British Sculpture movement; celebrity photographer and recipient of the Royal Photographic Society's Centenary medal Terry O'Neill (photographer) and Royal Academician and Turner Prize nominee sculptor David Mach. September 2018 saw Gentry exhibit 15 new works at Opera Gallery in London alongside South Korean sculptor Seo Young Deok in a joint show titled Human Connection. Gentry used a combination of outdated media including crushed data CDs, floppy disks and film negatives to \\"communicate the feeling of time passing, which is a really difficult thing to describe\\" with words alone. A solo show titled 'Face of London' was held at Opera Gallery in April 2019. Gentry launched his new project at the exhibition, taking photos of visitors to the show, which were then used to create modern-day selfie inspired portraits on vinyl LP record sleeves – another discarded piece of kit that he transformed into artistic data-rich time capsules of modern social history.. Later that year Gentry continued to experiment with using record sleeves in his large scale montage portraits at his first solo show in Paris at Opera Gallery in the exhibition 'ID Merge'. During lockdown in the Spring of 2020 Gentry undertook at project to communicate the experiences of front line health care staff dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic. This new series of portraits used computer punched card from the 1960s and 1970s to tell the stories of frontline National Health Service workers.

He worked in the Low Temperature Research Station in Cambridge where his main fields of research were meat and polyphenols. The discovery in 1943 by Martin and Synge of paper chromatography provided for the first time the means of surveying the phenolic constituents of plants and for their separation and identification. There was an explosion of activity in this field after 1945, none more so than that of Bate-Smith and Tony Swain. In 1951, Bate-Smith developed and first described a coloration method to detect the presence of condensed tannins (also called proanthocyanidins) in plant materials. This reaction is based on heating in acidic conditions and gives rise to anthocyanidin pigments. Bate-smith recommended the use of the Forestal solvent for the isolation of leuco-anthocyanins in 1954. In 1973, he suggested an assay based on the precipitation of hemoglobin by tannins.

It is a historic icon of Provo and has been home to many religious and cultural events. All but the outer walls of the building were destroyed by fire in December 2010. The Church of Jesus Christ preserved the remaining outer walls and built a new foundation and interior as part of the Provo City Center Temple, completed in 2016. First tabernacle in Provo Predating the existing Provo tabernacle was a smaller tabernacle (sometimes called the Old Provo Tabernacle) that stood from 1861-1919 on the same block, and was situated north of the current tabernacle building facing Center Street. Plans for the first tabernacle began as early as 1852, though ground wasn't broken until 1856. The Walker and Utah wars slowed the progress of building the original structure. Thomas Allman and John Watkins did much of the interior woodwork. The first tabernacle seated 1100, though more could fit with chairs added in the aisles. The single tower, located on the north end above the foyer, stood tall and carried a bell. For practical purposes, the tabernacle was completed in 1861, although the final plastering and dedication of the building occurred in 1867. There is confusion as to whether Brigham Young or John Taylor dedicated the first tabernacle. At the dedication, Brigham Young expressed that the tabernacle was \\"entirely too small\\" and should have been completed 12 years previously. The original Provo tabernacle was razed between 1918-1919. The foundation for the first tabernacle and nearby baptismal font were unearthed by the Office of Public Archaeology at Brigham Young University in 2012. Many coins, trinkets and other small items that had fallen through the floor boards and remained in the foundation were discovered. The rock foundation was then disassembled and the stones were donated to Provo City. Construction of the second tabernacle The Provo Tabernacle in 1914, before the center tower was removed. The construction for the second and larger Provo tabernacle (referred to also as the Utah Stake Tabernacle or the New Provo Tabernacle) started in 1883. It was built by the LDS Church as a meeting place that would hold more people than its predecessor. Harvey H. Cluff oversaw its construction. The new tabernacle, designed by William Folsom could seat 3,000 individuals in its auditorium and balconies. The tabernacle was in use by 1886, when it held the church's general conference on April 6. Members of the First Presidency were in hiding at the time on polygamy charges and were not present. The tabernacle was dedicated on April 17, 1898, by George Q. Cannon, with church president Joseph F. Smith also in attendance. The building costs totaled USD$100,000. In 1907, a USD$10,000 organ from the Austin Organ Company was installed. In 1917, the cupola was removed due to the roof sagging. In 1964, the tabernacle was updated, with much of the interior painted white, while the electrical and heating systems were updated.  Cultural impact  The Tabernacle was home to many concerts, LDS stake conferences, and other community events. One of the first big-name entertainers to perform in the tabernacle was Madame Abbie Carrington in 1891. On September 1, 1909, U.S. President William H. Taft visited and spoke in the tabernacle. In the 1930s, Herald R. Clark, the head of BYU's College of Commerce, arranged to use the tabernacle for university lyceum programs. One of the most famous lyceums occurred in 1938 when composer Sergei Rachmaninoff performed in concert. Many funerals of prominent residents of Provo were held in the tabernacle, including those of Abraham O. Smoot, Hugh Nibley and Truman Madsen. In 1975, the building was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.  Fire  Provo Tabernacle gutted by fire on 17 Dec 2010 A four-alarm fire was reported at the tabernacle on December 17, 2010, at 2:43 AM MST. Firefighters arrived to find smoke coming from the building. Firefighters initially believed they could save the roof and thus the outward structural integrity of the building, but at around 6:00 AM MST the roof collapsed. The fire continued to burn throughout the day. On March 31, 2011, after 12 weeks of investigation, the Provo City Fire Department released its findings and conclusion to the Provo Tabernacle Fire. The report states \\"The most probable proximate cause of the fire at the Tabernacle December 17, 2010 is a heat source, specifically an energized 300-watt lamp, which was placed too close to combustible materials, specifically a wooden speaker enclosure.\\" The report also finds deficiencies with the lack of a fire protection system (including automatic sprinklers and notification system) and human error (including multiple failures to alert authorities of suspicious circumstances such as odor, correcting an unsafe condition, and failure to recognize and respond to the fire alarm). According to press reports after the fire, a large painting of Jesus was found to have survived. All the figures including the background, with the exception of Jesus, in the painting were burnt by the fire. The figure of Jesus was surrounded by a clean, untouched area.  Restoration  Provo City Center LDS Temple time-lapse video Provo Tabernacle under restoration to become the Provo City Center Temple (May 2015). LDS Church president Thomas S. Monson announced in the semi-annual general conference on October 1, 2011, that the Provo Tabernacle would be rebuilt to serve as a second temple in Provo, making Provo the second city in the LDS Church to have two temples, following South Jordan, Utah, which has the Jordan River and Oquirrh Mountain temples. It is the second tabernacle in Utah to be converted to a temple, following the Vernal Utah Temple. The restoration included \\"a complete restoration of the original exterior,\\" and the artist's rendition in the press release included the central tower from the original building. As part of construction, the outer wall was placed on scaffolding for the excavation of two basement levels beneath it. Engineering Feat Puts Future Provo Temple on 'Stilts' from YouTube A public open house was held from Friday, January 15, 2016, through Saturday, March 5, 2016, excluding Sundays, and drew more than 800,000 visitors.

American surface combatants and two blimps sank a German U-boat off Point Judith, Rhode Island in one of the last actions of the Battle of the Atlantic. The SS Black Point a 368-foot, 7500 tons coal ship was sunk at the start of the Battle.usmm.org Black point Background  U-853 was one of five U-boats dispatched in February 1945 for operations off the North American coast. By May 1945, she was only one of the February boats remaining active and was one of just six U-boats operating off the North American coast. On May 6, she was patrolling the coast off Rhode Island. The SS Black Point (originally named SS Fairmont) was built in 1918 by the New York Shipbuilding Corporation in Camden, New Jersey. The 5,353 ton collier ship was 112.35 meters long, with a beam of 16.82 meters and a draft of 9.3 meters. She was powered by 3 boilers that powered one 3-cylinder triple expansion engine that powered a single shaft to a single screw with 462 nhp. During World War 1, she served in the US navy as the USS Fairmont. She was armed with one 6\\" deck gun and one 6-pounder deck gun. After the WWI, she was renamed the SS Nebraskan by the C.H. Sprague & Son Corp. wrecksite SS Black Pointnavsource.org Fairmont (ID 2429) By WWII, she was known as the SS Black Point. On May 6 she was en route to Boston, Massachusetts with United States Navy Armed Guard onboard to protect the ship. Battle The President of the German Reich Karl Dönitz directed all U-boats to cease attacks on 4 May, ahead of Germany's surrender. While most commanding officers obeyed this order, some either did not receive it or chose to ignore it. On 5 May, U-853 was lying in wait off Point Judith when she sighted the SS Black Point. Two torpedoes from the U-Boat struck the Black Point, one blew off the stern of the ship. Within 15 minutes. the ship capsized and sank in of water. The SS Black Point would be the last American- flagged merchant ship to be sunk in WWII. Of those aboard, 11 crewmen and one Navy guard died; 34 others were rescued by nearby vessels. A radio report about the torpedoing from one of the rescue ships, the SS Kamen, was picked up by US Navy's Eastern Sea Frontier command in New York and by the 1st Naval District in Boston. The nearest warships, which were under the command of Commander F. C. McCune, were part of Task Force 60.7 (TF60.7). The escort group consisted of destroyer (Lt.Cdr CA Baldwin), destroyer escorts (Lt.Cdr EL Barsumian) and (Lt.Cdr L Iselin ), and frigate (Lt.Cdr Tollaksen CG, ). Ericsson was transiting the Cape Cod Canal with McCune on board when the summons came, so the remaining four ships headed for Kamen's location, with Tollaksen in temporary command. They had been en route to Boston after escorting Convoy GUS 84 to New York. With the news of the sinking, they were immediately ordered to start a search and destroy mission against the submarine. When the first ships arrived at point Judith at 19.30, they began sweeping the area with their late-war Sonar equipment. U-853 was discovered bottomed in of water just after midnight. After the warships had made their first attack, oil was sighted on the surface sparking the first series of claims that the U-boat had been destroyed. However, the ships continued to find contacts, so the attacks continued. McCune resumed overall command when Ericsson arrived in the early hours of the morning. Amick was detached to make a pre-arranged rendezvous, and reinforcements arrived later, comprising the destroyers Barney, Breckinridge, and Blakeley, the frigate Newport, the corvettes Action and Restless, and the auxiliary destroyer Semmes. These took up position around the search site to guard against the U-boat slipping past the attackers. Attacks continued through the night. At 0530, oil, planking, life rafts, a chart tabletop, clothing, and an officer's cap were spotted on the surface. Nevertheless, destruction of U-853 was not accepted by the command of the 1st Naval District in Boston so the hunt continued. By daybreak, the K class blimps K-16 and K-58 from Lakehurst, New Jersey joined the attack, locating oil slicks and marking suspected locations with smoke and dye markers. K-16 also attacked with six rocket bombs. Finally at 1207 Eastern Sea Frontier in New York accepted the destruction of the U-boat and the hunt was ended.armed-guard.com SS Black Point Wreck Later that day, US Navy divers from located the wreck of U-853 at a depth of . Battle damage consisted of two hits to the submarine's pressure hull resulting in the death of all its 55-man crew. Evidence showed the U-853 had been destroyed at some point between midnight and mid-day on 6 May. During the 17-hour hunt, the warships from TF60.7 had expended 264 Hedgehog bombs and 95 depth charges; at least one ship was damaged by the concussion from the ordnance exploding in shallow waters. Many of the later attacks made by TF60.7 were so-called \\"tin-opener attacks\\" against the U-boat wreck in order to gain evidence of its destruction.

The railway was opened in several stages between 1840 and 1853, when the section from Poitiers to Angoulême was finished. The opening of the LGV Atlantique high speed line from Paris to Tours in 1989 has decreased the importance of this section of the line for passenger traffic; the opening of the LGV Sud Europe Atlantique in 2017 has seen all long distance passenger trains migrating to that line and leaving space for more regional and local trains, as well as freight trains. Route The Paris–Bordeaux railway leaves the Gare d'Austerlitz in Paris in southeastern direction. It follows the left Seine bank upstream until Juvisy-sur-Orge, where it starts following the small river Orge upstream. Beyond Melun it follows the left Seine bank upstream, along the Forest of Fontainebleau. Beyond Lardy, the railway follows the small river Juine upstream. Beyond Étampes it crosses the Beauce plains until it reaches Orléans. The Gare d'Orléans is a terminus; many long distance trains call at the nearby Gare des Aubrais instead. At Orléans the railway turns southwest, following the river Loire downstream along its right bank. It passes through Blois and Amboise, and crosses the Loire at Montlouis-sur- Loire, an eastern suburb of Tours. The Gare de Tours is a terminus as well; many long distance trains call at the nearby Gare de Saint-Pierre-des-Corps instead. The railway turns south again, crosses the rivers Cher and Indre, and follows the right Vienne bank upstream beyond Maillé. At Châtellerault it crosses the Vienne and continues upstream along the river Clain, through the city Poitiers. At Voulon the railway leaves the Clain valley and it follows the Charente valley from Saint-Saviol downstream. It leaves the Charente at Ruffec, crosses it again at Luxé and passes through the city Angoulême. It follows the small rivers Tude and Dronne downstream until its mouth at Coutras, where the railway crosses the river Isle. It follows the left Isle bank downstream to Libourne, where it continues west and downstream along the left Dordogne bank. It reaches the right Garonne bank at Bassens, and crosses the river at Cenon, entering its terminus Gare de Bordeaux-Saint-Jean after a total length of 584 km. Main stations The main stations on the Paris–Bordeaux railway are: * Gare d'Austerlitz (Paris) * Gare des Aubrais * Gare d'Orléans * Gare de Saint-Pierre-des-Corps * Gare de Tours * Gare de Poitiers * Gare de Bordeaux-Saint-Jean History The sections Paris–Orléans and Orléans–Bordeaux were built and exploited by two different companies, that became part of Chemin de Fer de Paris à Orléans in 1852. The first section that was opened in 1840 led from Paris to Juvisy-sur-Orge, a southern suburb. The line was extended to Orléans in 1843. Tours was reached in 1846, and Poitiers in 1851. In 1852 Bordeaux was connected with Angoulême. Finally in 1853 the section from Poitiers to Angoulême was opened. The Gare d'Austerlitz is the original terminus of the Paris–Bordeaux line. At the occasion of the 1900 Exposition Universelle the Gare d'Orsay was opened as the new terminus, with a more central location. The richly decorated Gare d'Orsay was only used by electric trains. After 1939 it was only used for suburban trains. Since 1986, the station building is a museum of 19th-century art.

A duct leakage tester consists of a calibrated fan for measuring an air flow rate and a pressure sensing device to measure the pressure created by the fan flow. The combination of pressure and fan flow measurements are used to determine the ductwork airtightness. The airtightness of ductwork is useful knowledge when trying to improve energy conservation. Uses Duct leakage testers are used in residential single family, residential multi-family, and commercial buildings that have a forced air delivery systems for heating and cooling. Operation A basic duct leakage testing system includes three components: a calibrated fan, a register sealing system, and a device to measure fan flow and building pressure. Supply registers or return air grills are sealed using adhesive tapes, cardboard, or non-adhesive reusable seals. One register or return is left unsealed, and the calibrated fan is connected to it. Pressure is monitored in one of the branches of the ductwork while the calibrated fan delivers air into the system. As air is delivered into the ductwork, pressure builds and forces air out of all of the openings in the various ductwork connections or through the seams and joints of the furnace or air-conditioner. The tighter the ductwork system (e.g. fewer holes), the less air is needed from the fan to create a change in the ductwork pressure. A duct leakage test can be performed by either pressurizing or depressurizing the ductwork. Ductwork that is outside the building envelope, such as in an unconditioned attic or crawlspace, should be pressurized so as to not bring in unwanted contaminants such as dust. Measurements Duct tester airtightness measurements are presented in a number of different formats including but not limited to: Air flow (CFM) CFM25 is defined as the air flow (in cubic feet per minute) needed to create a 25 Pascal pressure change in the ductwork. CFM25 is one of the most basic measurements of ductwork airtightness. A pressure of 25 Pa is equal to 0.1 inches (0.25 cm) of water column. Leakage area Leakage area estimates are a useful way to visualize the equivalent cumulative size of all leaks or holes in the ductwork. There are a variety of standard calculation methods used to estimate leakage areas. Ratings Commercial and industrial ductwork is often tested to standards developed by the Sheet Metal and Air Conditioning Contractors' National Association (SMACNA). Ductwork is temporarily subjected to higher pressures, and then given a rating or classification rather than a leakage estimate. Additional methods Leakage to outside The above test procedure describes how to determine total duct leakage, or how much leakage there is for all of the ductwork connected to the HVAC system. Another test is for duct leakage to the outside. Depending on the location of the house in the United States, some HVAC systems are completely inside the thermal envelope, some are completely outside the thermal envelope, and some are a combination of the two. Energy conservation is improved mostly by sealing ductwork that is outside the thermal envelope or connected to the outside. With mixed systems, it is possible to determine amount of leakage to the outside by simultaneously pressurizing the house while pressurizing the ductwork, and measuring the amount of flow that is required to equalize the pressure. Blower door subtraction Another form of duct leakage to outside uses a blower door to measure the total amount of leakage of the house, then seal off all registers and returns and to measure the leakage again. The next step requires measuring the pressure in the taped off duct system with respect to the building. The blower door manual will include a correction table to determine a correction factor based on the pressure in the duct work. To calculate the duct leakage to outside, subtract the leakage with the registers sealed from the total building leakage and multiply by the correction factor.How do I use the blower door subtraction method? – Support Pressure pan test Small pressure pan application A third test method to determine if ductwork is leaking to the outside is to use a pressure pan, which is a register cover with a pressure tap for a hose connection. With the house pressurized (or depressurized) to 50 Pa (-50 Pa) using a blower door, a pressure gauge is attached to the pressure pan by means of a hose. If the pressure difference is near zero, this indicates that the ductwork associated with that particular register is not connected to the outside. A pressure 5 Pa or above indicates that the duct work is connected to or leaking to the outside. A smaller pressure difference indicates greater leakage. This method does not quantify duct leakage, but serves to identify locations of ductwork runs that are leaking to the outside. It is more of a qualitative measure, used for fault isolation.

Within three years they had moved to Chicago, and then St. Paul, Minnesota. His father died of pneumonia when he was about three years old. Rutstrum dropped out of school in the seventh grade at age 13. Soon after that he began his working and adventuring life. Though his mother remarried, the family had little money and Rutstrum worked at a wide range of odd jobs, some of them entrepreneurial, at a very young age. At the same young age he also sought to maximize his time exploring and playing in his neighborhood's hardwood forest.Wilderness Visionaries by Dale Vickery 1986 North Woods Press Inc. Chapter 5 Rutstrum was also drawn to the Mississippi River. Before the age of 12 he had spent weeks traveling on it with his friends, often riding log booms. As he wrote later, there he was: > \\"a healthy young animal with less than a dozen years from birth, alive in > the early summer sunshine, barefooted, youthfully entranced, eager as spring > for life, as intrinsically a part of the river. I believed, as the > waterthrush that foraged at the mouth of Minnehaha Creek, where the rippling > current joined the mighty Mississippi...To be free as a wild creature, not > having to shoulder human cares, able to climb, run, jump. swim, lie on an > embankment in the sunshine—these gave a release to the young spirit that may > be perhaps described as primitive, but nevertheless exquisite in the most > elemental sense. At age 16, after acquiring his 30-30 carbine, .22 rifle, fishing tackle, ammunition, tent, bedroll, axe, knife, cook kit, and $25, he spent $24 of that for passage to Montana when he worked at a ranch riding fence in the summers and spent winters in a log cabin (line shack) in the mountains. Rutstrum began his first long canoe trip at age 18, a 100-day trip in the wilderness in northern Minnesota. Adult life He served in World War I as a Navy medical corpsman, and as a criminal bank investigator for 10 years, and as a camp instructor and guide. Later he made money by buying and selling land. In the early 1920s Rutstrum bought, subdivided and sold three 40 acre tracts on the northwest shore of Lake Superior. This, combined with his limited lifestyle requirements provided a significant large step towards financial independence, where jobs became superfluous. Early in his life he lived in a cabin on the Flute Reed river along Lake Superior's northwest shore between Grand Marais and Duluth. His next home was a cabin on an island in Sea Gull Lake, near the end of the Gunflint Trail in Minnesota where he lived for 10 years. Later, as this became too developed for him, he moved to Marchington Lake, about 30 miles east of Sioux Lookout, Ontario. He then built a stone house in Marine- on-St. Croix, Minnesota which became his primary residence, while retaining his Ontario cabin. He also built a home on Cloud Bay, Lake Superior. He intended it to be a \\"simple little house\\" but zoning regulations forced it to be more substantial. His wife Florence had been visiting Mexico with her aunt every year, and coaxed Cal to head southwest. Rutstrum and his wife Florence bought an adobe house in Puerto De Luna, New Mexico, in the Pecos River Valley, which they remodeled and modernized. They lived there part-time for seven years in the early 1960s. He decided that life there was unpleasant, and sold it back to its original owners. Emergence as an author His first book was Way of the Wilderness illustrated by Les Kouba. It taught readers how to live well in the wilderness, including in cold weather, and traveling by canoe. This book started as a wilderness manual written for Camp Lincoln, where he worked for 10 years. He then rewrote it for Macmillan publishing company who published it in 1946 as a hardcover because they suspected it would be successful. The Outdoor Book Club immediately ordered 52,000 copies. As he later recalled, he then said \\"this beats working\\". It is still considered a bible for serious canoeists.New York Times Obituary Article AP Published: February 21, 1982 His next book The New Way of the Wilderness (illustrated by Les Kouba) expertly covered how to equip and dress for winter, canoe camping, and how to eat well while wilderness camping. After that The Wilderness Cabin described how to build log cabins and fireplaces. North American Canoe Country covered wilderness canoe travel, including many specialized topics. Wilderness Route Finder focused on such using traditional methods. Paradise Below Zero covered long term sub-zero (Fahrenheit) wilderness camping and travel. It is both a \\"how to\\" book but with much inspirational and philosophical content in line with the title. The era of the book (1968) preceded the prevalence of newer camping products and materials. Paradise Below Zero is considered to be a bible for extended sub-zero camping without the use of modern equipment. He wrote his autobiography Challenge of the Wilderness which was published in 1970. It was reprinted in 1979 as A Wilderness Autobiography. Back Country was his final book, published in 1981. It was a storytelling book about backcountry characters with whom he had friendships or experiences. In a conversation with Jim Dale Vickery, Rutstrum characterized this book as being about \\"just the romance of the wilderness\\". Prominence The book \\"Wilderness Visionaries\\" included Rutstrum on a list of eight (North American) wilderness visionaries along with Henry David Thoreau, John Muir, Aldo Leopold, Robert Service, Bob Marshall, Olaus Johan Murie and Sigurd Olson. As with most of the others, his writing skills and published works contributed to his prominence. These combined with his expertise in wilderness living and travel, including in harsh conditions as well as his wilderness philosophies and experiences. As recreational use of wilderness areas began to rapidly grow, Rutstrum's writings were in the middle of it. The book Wilderness Visionaries said \\"In a sense, he became a high priest of an emerging camping cult.\\" His books captured both the \\"how to\\" and the pleasure of longer term wilderness travel and camping. Rutstrum and Bradford Angier were the two most prominent writers with this combination at the time. His life followed the philosophy espoused in his writings...prioritizing one's life for time in the wilderness, and the benefits of such. Books authored by Rutstrum Rutstrum's 15 books described his enchantment of the wilderness and instructed readers on preparing for and conducting trips (especially canoe trips) into remote areas.

The play was originally dedicated to Nikolai Nikolaevich Solovtsov, Chekhov's boyhood friend and director/actor who first played the character Smirnov. Characters * Elena Ivanovna Popova, a landowning little widow, with dimples on her cheeks *Grigory Stepanovitch Smirnov, a middle-aged landowner *Luka, Popova's aged footman Plot The play takes place in the drawing room of Elena Ivanovna Popova's estate exactly seven months after her husband's death. Since her husband died, Popova has locked herself in the house in mourning. Her footman, Luka, begins the play by begging Popova to stop mourning and step outside the estate. She ignores him, saying that she made a promise to her husband to remain forever faithful to his memory. Their conversation is interrupted when Grigory Stepanovitch Smirnov arrives and wishes to see Elena Popova. Although Luka tells Grigory Smirnov to leave, he ignores Luka's requests and enters the dining room. Popova agrees to meet with him and Smirnov explains to her that her late husband owes him a sum of 1,200 roubles as a debt. Because he is a landowner, Smirnov explains that he needs the sum paid to him on that same day to pay for the mortgage of a house due the next day. Popova explains that she has no money with her and that she will settle her husband's debts when her steward arrives the day after tomorrow. Smirnov gets angered by her refusal to pay him back and mocks the supposed 'mourning' of her husband, saying: :Well, there! \\"A state of mind.\\"... \\"Husband died seven months ago!\\" Must I pay the interest, or mustn't I? I ask you: Must I pay, or must I not? Suppose your husband is dead, and you've got a state of mind, and nonsense of that sort.... And your steward's gone away somewhere, devil take him, what do you want me to do? Do you think I can fly away from my creditors in a balloon, or what? Or do you expect me to go and run my head into a brick wall? Smirnov decides that he will not leave the estate until his debts are paid off, even if that means waiting until the day after tomorrow. He and Popova get into another argument when he starts yelling at the footman to bring him kvass or any alcoholic beverage. The argument turns into a debate about true love according to the different genders. Smirnov argues that women are incapable of loving \\"anybody except a lapdog\\", to which Popova argues that she wholeheartedly loved her husband although he cheated on her and disrespected her. The argument deteriorates into another shouting match about paying back the debt. During this argument Popova insults Smirnov by calling him a bear, amongst other names, saying, \\"You're a boor! A coarse bear! A Bourbon! A monster!\\" Smirnov, insulted, calls for a duel, not caring that Popova is a woman. Popova, in turn, enthusiastically agrees and goes off to get a pair of guns her husband owned. Luka overhears their conversation, gets frightened for his mistress, and goes off to find someone to help put an end to their feud before anyone gets hurt. Meanwhile, Smirnov says to himself how impressed he is by Popova's audacity and slowly realizes that he has actually fallen in love with her and her dimpled cheeks. When Popova returns with the pistols, Smirnov makes his love confession. Popova oscillates between refusing him and ordering him to leave and telling him to stay. Eventually, the two get close and kiss each other just as Luka returns with the gardener and coachman. Themes The Bear's comedy derives from the characters' lack of self-knowledge. The widow Popova fancies herself inconsolably bereaved, while Smirnov considers himself a misogynist. They are both stock examples of alazons: figures made ludicrous by pretending to be more than they actually are. History The Bear is one of many of Chekhov's \\"farce-vaudevilles\\", which also includes The Proposal, A Tragedian in Spite of Himself, and the unfinished Night before the Trial.Gottlieb, Vera. Chekhov and the Vaudeville: A Study of Chekhov's One-Act Plays. Cambridge Univ Pr, 2010. Print. In a letter to Yakov Polonsky on February 22, 1888 Chekhov wrote: :Just to while away the time, I wrote a trivial little vaudeville [vodevilchik]Pavlovich, Anton. The Complete Plays.

I plan something worthwhile—and—it is all tra-la-la! In spite of all my attempts at being serious the result is nothing; with me the serious alternates with the trivial! Chekhov used the French play Les Jurons de Cadillac by Pierre Berton as inspiration for The Bear. The main similarity between the two involves the idea of the male being a 'bear' tamed by a woman. Les Jurons de Cadillac was originally performed by the actor Nikolai Solovstov, whom Chekhov dedicates The Bear to and ultimately plays the role of Smirnov. It had its English language premiere in London in 1911.Pavlovich, Anton, and Sharon Marie. Four plays & three jokes. Hackett Publishing Company, 2009. 3. Print. The United States premiere was in New York in 1915. In 1935, Russian theatre producer and director Vsevolod Meyerhold produced 33 Swoons (also translated as 33 Fainting Fits), which was a production that combined Chekhov's The Anniversary, The Bear, and The Proposal. Meyerhold counted 33 cases of swooning and combined these three plays with swooning as the key comedic gag. Reception The play had its premiere in Korsh Theatre in Moscow on October 28, 1888. The Bear was a success from the start. In Chekhov's lifetime it brought in regular royalties, and it has constantly been revived on both professional and amateur stages worldwide since. Chekhov, who often referred to his own writing in self- deprecating ways, remarked on his success: \\"I've managed to write a stupid vaudeville which, owing to the fact that it is stupid, is enjoying surprising success.\\"Fen, Elisavita. Chekhov Plays. 2007. Print. Adaptations The play is the basis for operas by Dominick Argento (The Boor, 1957) and William Walton (The Bear, 1967). It was also the inspiration for the second act of the 1979 musical A Day in Hollywood/A Night in the Ukraine. It was adapted for an episode of the radio show On Stage in 1953. Walter Brown Newman wrote the script as a western, and Cathy Lewis, Elliott Lewis, Byron Kane, and Horace Murphy starred.

Dugan (born 19 March 1963), is an American businesswoman, inventor, technology developer and government official. She was the first female director of the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), where she served from July 2009 until March 2012. Dugan began working for DARPA in 1996. Over the next 4 years, she led numerous multimillion-dollar research programs. Her most notable research project, known as the 'Dog's Nose,' involved the development of an advanced portable system that could detect the explosive content of landmines. In 1999, she was awarded 'Manager of the Year' for her work at DARPA and in 2000, she was honored with the Bronze de Fleury Medal by the United States Army Corps of Engineers. She has also received awards from the United States Secretary of Defense; specifically, the Awards for Exceptional Service and Outstanding Achievement. Dugan left DARPA in 2000 to become a special advisor for the Vice Chief of Staff of the United States Army. Her work included a study titled 'Quick Reaction Study on Countermine,' which was briefed to senior members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and implemented in Operation Enduring Freedom. Dugan also took positions on the Naval Research Advisory Committee, Threat Reduction Agency and Technology panel. Prior to DARPA, she founded a company called Dugan Ventures. In 2005, Dugan Ventures began a new investment, RedXDefense LLC. After leaving DARPA in March 2012, she was appointed to an executive position at Google. Here, she led and created Advanced Technology and Projects (ATAP) at Motorola Mobility, a subsidiary of Google. In January 2014, it was announced that Motorola Mobility would be acquired by Lenovo. Dugan and her team were retained by Google. She later moved to Facebook, joining a team called Building 8. In October 2017, she announced that she would be leaving in early 2018 to pursue other endeavors.https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/17/facebooks-consumer-hardware- chief-regina-dugan-is-leaving-the-company/ In May 2020, she was announced as the CEO of Wellcome Leap. Education Dugan obtained her Bachelor of Science and Master of Science degrees in mechanical engineering from Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (Virginia Tech) in Blacksburg, Virginia. In May 2013, she was inducted into the Virginia Tech College of Engineering Academy of Engineering Excellence. Dugan was awarded a PhD by the California Institute of Technology (Caltech). Her thesis was titled “Axisymmetric buoyant jets in a cross flow with shear transition and mixing.” California State University, Fullerton presented Dugan with an honorary degree in 2011. Career Facebook In April 2016, Dugan left Google to head Facebook's 'Building 8',https://www.wired.com/2016/04/regina-dugan-leaves- google-for-facebook/ a research division similar to Google's ATAP group. In October 2017, Dugan announced she would be leaving Facebook in early 2018 to focus on building and leading a new endeavor. Google Dugan's advanced technology group was not a part of the Lenovo acquisition of Motorola Mobility. In February 2014, Dugan rejoined Google as Vice President of Engineering-Advanced Technology and Projects. ATAP developed Project Tango and Project Ara. In December 2018 The Register published an article alleging that her team were responsible for an attempt to patent an idea presented to them earlier by an MIT academic (Ji Qie) and that the subsequent involvement of MIT authorities forced them to back down and drop the application.https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/11/30/google_stole_my_patent/ Motorola Shortly after the Google acquisition of Motorola Mobility closed, Dugan was tasked with creating the Advanced Technology and Projects group, a skunkworks-inspired team chartered to deliver breakthrough innovations for the company. In an interview with the New York Times, Dugan described ATAP as \\"a small, lean, and agile group that is unafraid of failure,\\" she said, and that it will \\"celebrate impatience.\\" While at Motorola, ATAP developed and shipped several products including the Motorola Skip—part of an authentication portfolio that is also exploring digital tattoos and pills—and the augmented reality shorts, Spotlight Stories, which were featured at the 2014 Sundance Film Festival. It was there that ATAP announced the development of Project Ara, a free, open hardware platform for creating highly modular smartphones. Additionally, in an effort to streamline research projects, foster greater collaboration with the university research community, Dugan and her deputy, Dr. Kaigham (Ken) Gabriel, negotiated the Multi-University Research Agreement with, initially, eight leading public and private universities. DARPA Experienced in counterterrorism and defense against explosive threats, Dugan first served as a DARPA program manager from 1996 to 2000. During her first DARPA tour, she directed a diverse $100 million portfolio of programs, including the Dog's Nose program, which focused on the development of an advanced, field-portable system for detecting the explosive content of land mines. From July 2009 to March 2012, Dugan served as the 19th Director of DARPA and was the first woman to lead the Agency. As Director, she advanced strategic initiatives in the fields of cybersecurity, social media, and advanced manufacturing. She also led an active operational deployment in direct support of the war in Afghanistan for which the Agency was awarded the Joint Meritorious Unit Award. Boards In 2013, Dugan was appointed as the Board of Varian Medical Systems, Inc. (),http://newsroom.varian.com/2013-11-18-Regina-E-Dugan-Appointed-to-Board-of- Directors-of-Varian-Medical-Systems and in July 2014 she was appointed as the Board of Zynga ().http://investor.zynga.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=858927 Honors * CNBC NEXT List (2014)https://www.cnbc.com/id/102058732#. * Fast Company Most Creative People in Business 1000 (2014) * CNN \\"Top 10 Thinkers\\" (2013) * The Verge 50 (2013) * FierceWireless \\"Influential Women in Wireless\\" (2013) * Virginia Tech Academy of Engineering Excellence (2013) * Washingtonian Magazine \\"Tech Titan\\" (2011) * Joint Meritorious Unit Award by the Secretary of Defense for \\"outstanding heroism during war\\" * Office of the Secretary of Defense Award for Exceptional Service and the Award for Outstanding Achievement * Bronze De Fleury Medal by the Army Engineer Regiment (2000) * DARPA Program Manager of the Year (1999)  Innovation  \\"Disruptive innovation is the kind that unhinges old ways of operating, juices competition and creates new growth. One of the world’s leading experts on the subject is Regina Dugan,\\" wrote Pattie Sellers in her Postcards blog. Dugan has widely spoken and written about DARPA's non-linear style of innovation, which she brought with her to Motorola Mobility and Google. \\"Regina does bring in outside perspective specifically related to projects that are leaps, versus incremental steps,\\" Seattle-based wireless analyst Chetan Sharma recently told Technology Review. In a New York Times article, titled \\"New Force Behind Agency of Wonder\\", John Markoff noted that Dugan is \\"credited with having a knack for inspiring, and indeed insisting on, creative thinking. DARPA is often discussed as a place of innovation, which was addressed during a Washington Post Live summit on U.S. Competitiveness in Washington, D.C. Talking about DARPA's innovation was likened to talking about Picasso's impressionism. Based on their work at DARPA and then Motorola, Dugan and Gabriel co-wrote \\"Special Forces Innovation\\" for the Harvard Business Reviews October 2013 issue. Dugan partly attributes DARPA's success to an unwavering dedication to Pasteur's quadrant. The term, coined by political scientist Donald E. Stokes in his 1997 book by the same name, describes innovation that advances basic research and solves practical problems. It is contrasted with Bohr's quadrant, which seeks foundational knowledge about the world without any consideration for practical application and with Edison's quadrant in which purely practical problem solving is attempted. Other work Dugan has delivered several keynote addresses and moderated panel discussions at events as such as: * TED * All Things Digital D9 and D11 conferences * Clinton Global Initiative Annual Meeting * Clinton Global Initiative America's Meeting * EY Strategic Growth Forum * FORTUNE Most Powerful Women Summit * Qualcomm Uplinq * Washington Post Live * World Maker Faire In December 2013, Dugan was appointed to the Board of Directors of Varian Medical Systems, Inc. (VAR). Potential conflict of interest In March 2011, an article in Wired magazine stated that Dugan held stock in RedXDefense, her previous firm. In accordance with DoD policy, Dugan disclosed and recused from matters involving her former firm. A DARPA spokesperson stated that Dugan had no involvement in a 2010 contract award to RedXDefense, and that the contract was vetted by the agency's top lawyer to assure there was no conflict. Subsequently, the LA Times and Wired reported that her company had received around $1.8M in DARPA contracts and that Dugan held a promissory note from RedXDefense in the amount of $250,000. Others have argued that the Wired reporters' accusations are unjustified. In August, 2011, the Inspector General of the Department of Defense(DoD) began an investigation to ensure the procedures had been followed, and to examine DARPA's general policies on conflict of interest as well as a specific concern that DARPA Director Regina Dugan retains financial ties to her former firm, which has won some $6 million in contracts with the agency, $4.3 million of which was awarded prior to her position as Director. The Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, Ashton Carter, and the Department of Defense, General Counsel, Jeh Johnson, stated in a letter dated May 2011 addressed to Dugan, \\"based on what we know, we are satisfied that, given your disqualification from matters related to RedXDefense and the procedures you have put in place, there has been no violation of conflict of interest laws or regulations in the selection or funding of RedXDefense's proposals while you have been Director of DARPA\\". Prior to entering the Department of Defense, potential political appointees disclose their business investments and holdings for review. Senior ethics officials in the Office of the Secretary of Defense General Counsel, Standards of Conduct Office (OSDGC, SOCO) determine what procedures are required to address potential conflicts. The procedures are designed to ensure that companies are neither favored nor disfavored and to permit talent to be attracted to government service.

Origins Born before 1430, he was probably the son of Robert Brandon, collector of customs at King’s Lynn and Great Yarmouth, in Norfolk, who served as a Member of Parliament for Bishop's Lynn in 1421. Career He became a retainer of the local magnates, the Dukes of Norfolk, rising to be a senior member of the council of John de Mowbray, 4th Duke of Norfolk by 1476. In 1454-55 he acted as escheator for Norfolk and Suffolk, and in 1468 sat as a Member of Parliament for New Shoreham. In 1469 he was present at the Siege of Caister Castle, and in 1471 as a member of the victorious Yorkist forces he was knighted by King Edward IV on the field at the Battle of Tewkesbury. In 1471 he was one of ten knights who swore allegiance to the Prince of Wales, the future King Edward V. In 1475 he returned to military service in the invasion of France, which ended with the Treaty of Picquigny. As a member of the Royal Household, in 1479 he was appointed Knight Marshal of the Marshalsea Court, an office for life which passed to his son Thomas in 1491. In July 1483 he was present at the coronation of King Richard III, but despite marks of royal favourGrainger his loyalty became suspect when two of his sons, William and Thomas, joined the rebellion of Henry Stafford, 2nd Duke of Buckingham in October. Some of his lands were seized by Thomas Hopton on the King's orders, but he secured a free pardon in March 1484. By the end of that year, he was out of favour again and sought sanctuary in the City of Gloucester, where he remained until after Richard's defeat and death at the Battle of Bosworth in August 1485. Later that year he petitioned Parliament for, and regained, his office of Knight Marshal.

Built in 1896 to the design of W.A. Deighton for Chester's Brewery Company, it is a Grade II listed building. The brewery premises, comprising two-storey offices, copper room, maturing room, single-storey boiler room, chimney and five-storey tower, were built in pressed red brick with ashlar dressings and Welsh slate roofs. Company Threlfall's Brewery Company had breweries in Liverpool and Salford. The company was active between 1861 and 1967. John Mayor Threlfall bought the Lupton and Adamthwaite Brewery in 1861. The company was registered in Liverpool in 1888. In around 1895, Threlfall's bought the Blue Lion (previously White Lion and Apollo) public house on Cook Street in Salford and built the Cook Street Brewery. The company took over Chester's in 1961 and Threlfall's operated the Cook Street site as Chesters and Threlfalls Brewery, while Threlfalls continued to brew in its Liverpool brewery. The Threlfall's group included West Cheshire Brewery, Birkenhead Brewery and Mackies off licences. Whitbread took over the group including the Moorhouse's soft drinks company in 1967 and the Salford site became surplus to requirements in 1999. Whitbread closed the company's head office, brewery and bottling plant in Trueman Street Liverpool in the early 1980s. In 1967, Threlfall's was the eighth largest brewery in the United Kingdom, and the largest in North West England. After the takeover, Whitbread, a predominantly southern based business, became the second largest brewery business in the United Kingdom. Redevelopment The grade II listed Salford premises have been redeveloped into the Deva Centre, an urban business village. The Liverpool buildings have been partly demolished and replaced with flats and the head office converted to small office units.

Traditionalists were opposed to expanding the existing San Fernando Valley zoned pages into a semi-independent publication with its own focus and its own printing plant. That circumstance had been completed by 1989, when Jeffrey S. Hall, vice president of marketing for the Times was named to a new position of president of the San Fernando Valley edition, directing business operations there. The editorship remained with Charles Carter, who reported to Suburban Editor Robert Rawitch.

Minorities In a 1990 investigation of minority recruitment at the Los Angeles Times, journalism investigative reporter David Shaw found that the zone sections had become \\"a training ground of sorts for the main paper\\" and that that practice had \\"helped create the paper's poor reputation with minorities\\" because they had to start in a suburban office rather than downtown.David Shaw, \\"Amid L.A.'s Ethnic Mix, The Times Plays Catch-Up Media,\\" Los Angeles Times, December 14, 1990 During the 1992 Rodney King Riots, African American reporters who were working on the suburban sections were \\"hastily dispatched into trouble spots while the predominantly white Metro staff stayed in the newsroom,\\" according to Greg Braxton, one of those black reporters.

City Times cost $1.5 million annually and was not profitable. It had a low penetration in the central city, with many copies just given away.  Decline  On November 6, 1992, the Times announced it would stop publishing its San Diego County edition and eliminate 500 jobs throughout the company through a voluntary buyout and normal attrition.

She made her debut in the Biathlon World Cup in the season opener in Bad Gastein, where she finished 24th at the 20 km individual. A year later, again in Bad Gastein for the first time in her career she came home in the top ten finishing #7 at the sprint. She was most notably consistent in the individual event ever since where she claimed three World Cup victories (1995-96 in Osrblie, 1996/97 in Nozawa Onsen and 1997/98 in Östersund). Overall, she managed a total of nine podiums - seven individual and two sprint ones. In 1996 Koblar was 4th in the World Cup total and placed 6th in 1997-1998 season. Between 1995 and 2005 Koblar continuously competed on the World Cups level. Her best results were a sixth place at the Sprint 1995 in Antholz, a fourth place at 1999 in Holmenkollen at the mass start and a seventh place at the home World Cup 2001 individual race in Pokljuka.

Early life Angier was from Dedham, in Essex, where he was baptised 8 October 1605. At his own desire was brought up to be a preacher. At the age of twelve he was a grave child; but during his stay at Cambridge University as an undergraduate of Emmanuel College 'he fell off to vain company and loose practices.' He took his B.A. degree in 1625/6. His father subsequently died while he was from home, and whilst staying at his mother's house he came under the influence of John Rogers, of Dedham, one of the most forceful of the puritan preachers. Angier liveded for some time with Rogers, and afterwards with a Mr. Witham. He is next found boarding, studying, and sometimes preaching, at the house of John Cotton, of Boston, Lincolnshire, which was frequented by puritan ministers. Here he met Ellen Winstanley, a native of Wigan, the niece of Mrs. Cotton, and married her at Boston church 16 April 1628. After the birth of his first son he planned with other ministers to go to New England; but he made a journey into Lancashire to his wife's relations. He preached a sermon at Bolton, and one of the hearers made him promise to preach at Ringley chapel. In spite of his fainting in the pulpit on this occasion, the Ringley people were determined to have Angier as their pastor, and in September 1630 he accepted their call, and settled with them. Ecclesiastically his case was unusual. By the interest of Cotton he was ordained by Lewis Bayly, bishop of Bangor, but without subscription; and he remained a nonconformist to the Anglican ceremonies to the end of his days. Early career Angier's diocesan was John Bridgeman, bishop of Chester, who dealt with him mildly and was rebuked by William Laud. He was, however, suspended from Ringley after about eighteen months' service. Denton chapelry was at this time vacant by the suspension of its puritan minister, and the choice of the people was directed towards Angier, who settled with them in 1632, and remained their pastor, with some interruptions caused by the troubles of the time, for more than forty- five years. He was twice excommunicated, and his congregation often were disturbed by the ruling powers. It was thought that he had some hand in a book reflecting on Laud, which was discovered at Stockport; but in his diary he professed his innocence of it. Angier escaped serious persecution. When the episcopal constitution of the church was abolished, his former congregation at Ringley tried to recover him. The contest between the two congregations was referred to the judgement of ministers, who decided that Angier should stay in his latest settlement. When the Presbyterian form of church government was established in Lancashire, he often acted as moderator of the classis, and attended the provincial assembly, and had ruling elders in his own congregation. His presbyterianism was moderate, and he incurred some blame for the breadth of his views as to church discipline. Under the Commonwealth Angier signed the document known as the 'Harmonious Consent', issued in 1648, in which the Presbyterian ministers denounced the notion of 'an universal toleration of all the pernicious errors, blasphemous and heretical doctrines broached in these times.' Angier testified against the execution of Charles I, and refused to sign the engagement to be true to the commonwealth of England as established without king or house of lords. On this account he was, with other ministers, taken prisoner to Liverpool; the plague was raging there, and they were moved to Ormskirk. The time was passed in a discussion about prayer, and the diversity of opinion led them to select one of their number to treat the matter more fully. In this prison-house talk originated the treatise on prayer of Edward Gee of Eccleston. Many cases of conscience were propounded to Angier, whose judgment was so greatly relied upon, that the ill-natured styled him the 'idol of Lancashire.' He had also a reputation as a healer of quarrels. He preached twice on Sunday, and often on week days, praying seven times daily, fasting and travelling frequently. Later life Angier took no overt part in the Cheshire rising of 1659, and after the Act of Uniformity 1662 he escaped the persecution that fell on most of the nonconformists. Warrants were indeed issued against him; but those who had to execute them acknowledged that they would not see him for a hundred pounds. Something, no doubt, was due to the influence of his brother-in-law, Mosley of Ancoats, whose mother and sister stayed with Angier for many years. When the Oxford Act came into operation, he moved into Cheshire; but an attack of gout came on, and saying to Oliver Heywood, 'Come, son, let us trust God and go home,' he returned to Denton. The neighbouring justices said, 'He is an old man, and will not live long; let us not trouble him.' John Wilkins, the new bishop of Chester, frequently inquired after his health. Angier admitted Heywood to the communion at Denton after his excommunication. John Angier died in prayer, after several days' illness, 1 September 1677, and was buried at Denton, his funeral being attended by a great concourse of people. Writings The only work bearing John Angier's name is An Helpe to Better Hearts for Better Times, London, 1647, consisting of sermons preached in 1638. Another work has been attributed to him, and Robert Halley holds it to be his, a tract.Lancashire's Valley of Achor is England's doore of hope; set wide open in a brief history of the wise, good, and powerful hand of Divine Providence, ordering and managing the militia of Lancashire. By a well-wisher of the peace of the land and piety of the church, London, 1643. Its content relates to the incidents of the civil war in Lancashire. Family His first wife, a pious and sickly woman, died in December 1642, leaving him a son and two daughters. By her deathbed suggestion Angier, a year later, married Margaret Mosley, of Ancoats, whose family were of great local consideration, and held the lordship of the manor of Manchester. They were married in 1643 'very publicly in Manchester church, in the heat of the wars, which was noticed as an act of faith in them both.' She died in 1675. Angier's own daughter, by his desire, was betrothed to Oliver Heywood, a month before their marriage in Denton chapel in 1655, and after the final ceremony he entertained about a hundred guests at his table, for he said he loved to have a marriage like a marriage. John Angier's son, also named John, was born at Boston in 1629, and, like his father, went to Emmanuel College, Cambridge. His studies, however, were so unsatisfactory that, when in 1657 he applied for ordination, 'he was approved for parts and ability,' but it was thought fitting that he should make public acknowledgment of the errors of his youth. He was appointed to Ringley Chapel, but moved to Lincolnshire, where he was resident at the time of his father's death. His widow died in 1699. Samuel Angier, presbyterian minister, was nephew of John Angier the elder.

The pairwise sorting network has the same size (number of comparators) and depth as the odd–even mergesort network. At the time of publication, the network was one of several known networks with a depth of O(log^2 n). It requires n(\\\\log n)(\\\\log n - 1)/4 + n - 1 comparators and has depth (\\\\log n)(\\\\log n + 1)/2. The sorting procedure implemented by the network is as follows (guided by the zero-one principle): # Sort consecutive pairwise bits of the input (corresponds to the first layer of the diagram) # Sort all pairs into lexicographic order by recursively sorting all odd bits and even bits separately (corresponds to the next 14 layers of the diagram) # Sort the pairs in nondecreasing order using a specialized network (corresponds to the final layers of the diagram)  Pseudocode  Given the number n of elements to sort, this is one possible non-recursive technique to calculate the index values of the elements to sort: # given a positive integer n, being the number of elements to sort # note: subscripts are numbered from 0 to (n-1) a = 1; while (a < n) b = a c = 0 while (b < n) #### Compare and sort elements with indices (b-a) and (b) #### b = b+1 c = mod(c+1, a) if (c0), then b = b+a end loop (b) a = 2*a end loop (a) a = floor(a/4); e = 1; while (a > 0) d = e; while (d > 0) b = (d+1) * a c = 0 while (b < n) #### Compare and sort elements with indices (b-d*a) and (b) #### c = mod (c+1, a) b = b+1 if (c 0), then b = b+a end loop (b) d = floor (d/2); end loop(d) a = floor (a/2); e = e*2 + 1; end loop(a)  Relation to Batcher odd-even mergesort  The pairwise sorting network is very similar to the Batcher odd-even mergesort, but differs in the structure of operations. While Batcher repeatedly divides, sorts and merges increasingly longer subsequences, the pairwise method does all the subdivision first, then does all the merging at the end in the reverse sequence. In certain applications like encoding cardinality constraints, the pairwise sorting network is superior to the Batcher network.http://ianparberry.com/research/sortingnetworks/  References   External links  * Sorting Networks – Archive of web page by the author.

Artichoke Hill - Sun Hill Police Station Set and Location Filming Whilst Woodentop used a traditional three-wall set built at Thames Television's studios at Teddington, for the series, Sun Hill Police Station was created by converting the premises of a two-storey former cigarette packing company on the corner of Artichoke Hill and Pennington Street, in Wapping, East London. The police station was significantly smaller than subsequent versions, with almost-all of the interior offices being seen on-screen - Only the original packing/warehouse area alongside the rear yard not featuring. Production offices doubled with some of the sets, with the canteen being used by cast and crew, and notably Chief Superintendent Brownlow's office actually being that of producer Michael Chapman. When shooting was taking place upstairs, the production team were unable to continue typing or to take phone calls. Located in the shadow of the towering wall that surrounded the then-disused Tobacco Dock, and alongside the cobbles of Pennington Street, the nondescript 1950's building was very much in an East-End setting. Fronting onto the short stretch of road called Artichoke Hill, road signs were simply covered with those reading Sun Hill when exterior filming was taking place. The use of real buildings instead of traditional sets within TV studios was very unusual at that time, with Channel Four's \\"Brookside\\" being one of the few others then to do so. Hand-held video cameras allowed the actors to move from within the building directly onto the street - Something that was just not possible with traditional studio-based production and created a new degree of realism for the viewer. Many of the crew enjoyed the autonomy of working at Thames' East London outpost, however transport links to the area were then very poor and many of the Teddington-based staff disliked the cross-city journey from West London. This remained a constant at Artichoke Hill, and may have been a factor in the choice of a West-London location when the filming base was forced to move for Series 3. In 2020, many of the cast and crew shared their memories of making these first two series for a new book Witness Statements Cast and Character Changes Although the series is a continuation of the one-off play, a number of casting and character changes were made. The character of Sergeant Wilding changes name to Sergeant Cryer, and was recast with Eric Richard replacing Peter Dean. Since the transmission of \\"Woodentop\\", Dean had secured the role of Pete Beale in EastEnders, following the re-casting of the original choice, Leslie Grantham, as Den Watts. Robert Pugh, who had appeared as DI Galloway, decided shortly before production was due to begin that he did not want to commit to a series and the role was recast with John Salthouse. The senior uniformed officer, Inspector Deeping, was replaced with Chief Superintendent Brownlow, played by Peter Ellis. Ellis had auditioned originally for one of the CID characters, but was felt to be too old. PC Morgan's name was changed to PC Edwards, although still played by Colin Blumenau. Larry Dann was offered the part of Sergeant Alec Peters the day before filming of the first episode, after the actor originally cast in the role repeatedly forgot his lines. Both Jon Iles (DC Dashwood) and Tony Scannell (DS Roach) were initially booked to appear in only two episodes. The original casting was the responsibility of Pat O'Connell, and there is a strong link with some of the original male cast appearing in successful plays at the Royal Court Theatre in London during early 1983. John Salthouse and Eric Richard took the lead roles in the Martin Allen play Red Saturday, and Gary Olsen, Mark Wingett and Robert Pugh all appeared in “Welcome Home”. Industrial Dispute - Impact on Production & Transmission During 1984 a dispute between Thames Television and the technician's union, the ACTT led to a series of strikes which impacted the production and transmission on the ITV network of the first series. The first series was due to consist of twelve episodes, but only eleven were fully completed. Scenes had already been shot for the missing episode, which was later completed as \\"The Chief Super's Party\\", with some re-writing reflecting cast changes, as the final episode of Series Two. In addition, a publicity photo featuring DI Galloway at a kitchen table, surrounded by food was also released within a Series One press pack, though the scene does not feature in any transmitted episodes. The episodes \\"A Friend in Need\\" and \\"Clutching At Straws\\" were transmitted in their usual 9.00pm Tuesday slots on the 23rd & 30th of October 1984, in the Thames TV (London) region only, as technicians had walked-out, leaving management to run the service. ACTT members in the other ITV companies supported their London- based colleagues by refusing to transmit Thames output across the network, so these episodes were shown in all other ITV regions in February 1985, a few weeks after the last episode \\"The Sweet Smell of Failure\\" had been broadcast. The Bill Titles & End Credits The first series used the well-known \\"walking feet\\" sequence to close, but also a related sequence of the officers walking toward the camera with just the police officer's caps visible as opening titles. This is intercut with still-photos of nearby locations to the production base including, Breezer’s Hill, Tower Hamlets, Metropolitan Wharf, Wapping Wall, Glamis Road & Leman Street. Pennington Street in Wapping is the location of the cobbles that the officers walk along. Subsequent updates of the end credits continued to be shot there, even when the production base moved to other locations from 1986. Actors Karen England and Paul Page-Hanson are the male and female officers. Both appear as extras in the first series.

Life His name appears on the title-page of a unique volume of poems (1621, 4to), once in Samuel Christie-Miller's library at Britwell. The contents of this volume are: (1) 'The Bride's Ornament, Poetical Essays upon a Divine Subject;' (2) 'A Funeral Elegy consecrated to the memory of his ever honoured lord, John King, late Bishop of London;' (3) 'The Song of Songs metaphrased in English heroicks.' Anthony a Wood, sub 'John Argall',Athen. Oxon. vol. i. col, 761, ed. Bliss writes: 'Now I am got into the name of Argall I must let the reader know that in my searches I find one Richard Argall to be noted in the reign of King James I for an excellent divine poet, having been much encouraged in his studies by Dr. Jo, King, bishop of London, but in what house educated in Oxon, where he spent some time in study, I cannot now tell you.' After enumerating the works mentioned above, he proceeds: 'He also wrote a book of meditations of knowledge, zeal, temperance, bounty, and joy. And another containing meditations of prudence, obedience, meekness, God's word, and prayer. (These latter unpublished.)' But it is very doubtful whether a poet of the name of Richard Argall ever existed. In 1654 the 'Bride's Ornament,' &c.;, and the 'Meditations' were included in a collection of the poems of Robert Aylett, one of the masters of the high court of Chancery. It is unlikely that the name Richard Argall had been adopted as a nom de plume, and it is equally unlikely that a man in Aylett's position would have had the impudence to reissue another person's verses under his own name. From the fact that only one copy is known of the early edition it might be suggested that Aylett, learning of the attempted fraud, succeeded in calling in the copies that had gone abroad under Argall's name.

Education  Graduated from the Painting Department of Mimar Sinan University, Faculty of Fine Arts.  Work  Cosentino's works are in the Istanbul Museum of Modern Art (Permanent Collection)  Art  Artist and critic Pınar Öğrenci describes Antonio Cosentino's art as follows; \\"In Antonio Cosentino’s works, one finds a wealth of images distilled from everyday life, the depths of personal, memory, and the visual culture of the artist’s city. While the shifting character of highbrow and low-brow art was being discussed in the 90’s contemporary art milieus, Cosentino and his artist friends undertook, as it were, the archaeology of a gaze which brought subculture into question. It is from this period on that Cosentino’s painting incorporated materials from the visual culture of our geography without letting one dominate the others: panels, signboards, wrappings and ceramic tiles. The artist’s images embrace an expression that is dislocated and fragmentary, but also somehow holistic and repetitive, thereby breaking open a third window: a mnemonic space that is at once colorful and meditative... While his memory constantly operates like an archivist, the artist documents all sorts of written and visual data. Cosentino’s mobile and ludic setup once again reminds us of the typical obliviousness of modernity, by suggesting concepts such as the fleetingness of megacities and urban architecture, the loss of human scale and localness, the superhuman speed and even consumption.\\"http://zilbermangallery.com/antonio- cosentino-a325.html  Solo exhibitions  *2018 \\"Summer was a Beautiful Day\\", Zilberman Gallery, Berlin, Germany *2016 \\"boxes of cigarettes and whisky all over the sea, feråre, my love\\", Zilberman Gallery, Istanbul, Turkey *2015 \\"Mom I’m going out to pour some concrete, with Memed Erdener\\", Studio X, Istanbul Turkey *2015 \\"Escape from Marmara\\", Salt Ulus, Ankara, Turkey *2015 \\"Painting Exhibition\\", Nurol Art Gallery, Ankara, Turkey *2014 \\"Escape from Marmara\\", Bergsen & Bergsen Gallery, Istanbul, Turkey *2013 \\"Tin City, Karaköy Külah, Istanbul\\", Turkey2011 \\"Time Tunnel\\" Gallery Kullukcu, München, Germany *2008 \\"Picture Book of History and Stuff \\" Pi Artworks, Istanbul, Turkey *2007 \\"Çimentofayansavize\\" Evin Art Gallery, Istanbul, Turkey *2005 \\"Sisli – Yesilkoy\\", Evin Art Gallery, Istanbul, Turkey *2004 \\"Istanbul 2003-Concrete Sea\\", Evin Art Gallery, Istanbul, Turkey *2002 \\"Luna Park\\", İş Bank Parmakkapı Art Gallery, Istanbul, Turkey  Group exhibitions  *2010: \\"Arter.

Ancar was regarded as a front company of Ancar World Wide Investments Holding, a company with dubious financial European capital, registered in the USA. Today Ancar Angola now does not exist anymore and the project was ceased from both sides, from the German as well as the Angolan side. There were serious corruption allegations against the main responsibles.  History  The initiators of the project, at that time, were former Škoda Auto board member, Helmuth Schuster,Der Spiegel newsmagazine: With Prostitutes and Shady Executives, There's No Love Left in this Bug July 18, 2005 and John Johannsen, searched by the Spanish police with an arrest warrant for serial cheating. Due to dubious business practices of the two, German television channel NDR broadcast on July 14, 2005 on her political program a report about the Volkswagen corruption scandal.VW-Skoda was warned on time about dubious business partners of the board of directors Schuster July 14, 2005 (German) According to this news, Volkswagen-Board responded with the dismissal of one board member and additionally ordered to stop the construction of the factory, some outside the Angolan Capital Luanda. The reputation of Volkswagen in Africa was at stake. It was feared that the partner company is a dummy firm. Volkswagen only continued further negotiations until an extensive review of the company took place and then suspended the project.  Current situation  However, Volkswagen announced surprisingly in a press release on June 28, 2008 to continue construction works and to open the assembly factory in 2009. An investment of 15 million U.S. Dollars, including the establishment of a nationwide dealer network was planned too. Another Angolan company called ASGM N24: Production soon also in Angola June 28, 2008 (German) came in to participate in this project with a capital of 48 million U.S. Dollars. Infrastructure and its associated dealer network are currently placed under Volkswagen of South Africa. Indeed, the present state is, that the Volkswagen Group, currently has no plans to put this project back to work. (February 2011).

The barn is located on the west shore of Bass Lake. The basement is constructed of red tile, and the upper level of the barn is sheathed with shiplap siding. The interior space contains a circle of stanchions for feeding cattle, while the upper level has storage for feed and equipment. The barn was built between 1917 and 1924. The architect, Ernest Marsh, was locally known for other structures such as neoclassical and Georgian Revival residences. This round barn was part of a trend, which started in the late 19th century, of round barns whose plans were circulated as an advance in \\"scientific agriculture\\". The barn was used as a dairy barn from 1924 through the 1940s. As Anoka County experienced more suburban development, the majority of the county's dairy barns were demolished.

The cash consisted of an InternetCash number together with a customer-selected PIN. The InternetCash e-currency could then be spent with participating online merchants. An early name for InternetCash, before it acquired the internetcash.com domain name, was SpendCash.com. InternetCash was founded in April 1999 and it filed several patents to protect its novel electronic money system. Its founders raised over $10 million, mostly from Jim Bidzos D. James Bidzos oral history interview and ElDorado Ventures, a Menlo Park venture capital firm ElDorado Ventures between May and December 1999. Businessweek article: How can kids buy stuff on the web? - Ask InternetCash Founders InternetCash's founders were Charles Doherty, Yiannis Tsiounis, Jason Richelson, and Ben Reddy. Doherty, an entrepreneur, had the idea about a pre-paid card system and contacted Yiannis Tsiounis, who had recently completed his Ph.D. in electronic cash, in order to build a suitable architecture for the system and write the appropriate patents. Tsiounis subsequently contacted Jim Bidzos who funded the first institutional investment round. Independently, Ben Reddy, also an entrepreneur, had the same idea and worked with Jason Richelson to write and file a similar patent in April 1999. Mr. Doherty, the CEO of InternetCash, proceeded to recruit Reddy and Richelson in May 1999 and the patent work was combined under the guidance of Dr. Tsiounis, by then InternetCash's CTO. Mr. Reddy took on the role of VP of Sales and Mr. Richelson that of VP of Operations. Todd Kahn took over as President and COO in April 2000. Other notable alumni include serial entrepreneur and 10X Capital founder Hans Thomas. System architecture InternetCash faced the choice of piggybacking on existing payment networks, such as those of Visa and MasterCard, or to build its own payment network. It chose the latter in order to offer better security, especially on the Internet payment side. Therefore, InternetCash required merchants to redirect the customer to a new web page, which was operated by InternetCash and was called the \\"InternetCash payment window\\", where they would type in their card number and PIN. Part of the card number together with the transaction details and timestamp was then digitally signed by that window (using InternetCash's hardware encryption devices) and then sent back to the merchant for storage and reference. The digital signature and the transaction details were then sent to InternetCash's payment server, where the transaction was completed. This two-stage approach allowed full flexibility on the deployment of the \\"InternetCash Payment Window\\", which was effectively providing the payment security to the system, so it could be run on separate servers than the actual \\"banking\\" system, which maintained the card balances and performed the transactions. Visa, MasterCard and JCB adopted a similar architecture a few years later, in 2001, Visa launch password program to boost online shopping security for their 3-D Secure (also known as \\"Verified by Visa\\", \\"MasterCard SecureCode\\" and \\"J/Secure\\") system. An additional advantage of this architecture was that the \\"InternetCash Payment Window\\" could be used to securely accept any type of payment, including credit cards (much like 3-D Secure), debit cards and checks, and not just its own pre-paid cards. In fact, efforts were made by its founders to enable American Express's \\"blue\\" chip cards Blue by American Express. and regular debit cards to be used online, but after the Internet crash many of the companies involved put these projects on hold. In addition to building its own secure Internet- based payment network, InternetCash utilized hardware encryption devices from nCipher (acquired by Thales on July 11, 2008 Thales buys nCipher for $100 million) combined with custom code for generating its card numbers. InternetCash card generation used secret sharing techniques, requiring a quorum of authorized company Officers present when the cash was minted. The card numbers themselves included a digital signature based on keyed hash functions, thus preventing third parties from randomly generating a card number—a form of security not present in typical credit or debit card numbers.

The colliery, sunk in 1884 and known to be a \\"fiery pit\\", was owned by John Speakman. Explosion On the day of the disaster 159 men and boys were underground working a shift that started at 6.00 a.m. and would have ended mid afternoon. The disaster took place at about 10.45a.m. in the Crombouke mine (seam) at a depth of about 530 yards and 700 yards from the pit-eye (shaft bottom). The miners in other areas of the pit were wound to the surface. One man working at the seat of the explosion, John Woolley a \\"dataller\\", (day wage man) survived and, though burned, managed to get to the bottom of the shaft. When the alarm was raised, the pit manager W. Horrobin, underlooker James Calland and the mine owner's son, Harry Speakman led a rescue party to investigate but were impeded by the presence of afterdamp. According to Calland the afterdamp was \\"very strong and makes the men very dizzy. When they have this feeling they have to come up quickly to the fresh air\\". The Mines Inspector, Joseph Dickinson of Pendleton was contacted by telegraph. The explosion occurred before the formation of mines rescue teams but assistance arrived from nearby collieries and an exploring party of men from Bickershaw Colliery, Astley and Tyldesley Collieries and the Wigan Coal and Iron Company went underground but considered there would be no survivors. The underground fires were eventually extinguished and bodies brought to the surface. Aftermath News of the explosion travelled quickly, by 11 a.m. a crowd of women had arrived at the pit and in the evening a crowd estimated to be between eight and ten thousand had gathered at the pit head. The burned and mutilated bodies were wrapped in tarpaulins and taken to the wheelwrights shop and the joiners shop was used as a mortuary. The youngest victim was 15 years old and the oldest 65. The average age of those who died was 32 and 48 children were left fatherless. Some families lost more than one member. The colliery subscribed to the Lancashire and Cheshire Miners' Permanent Relief Society whose officials attended at the colliery. A committee of local dignitaries was formed to raise monies for the \\"Relief of Widows, orphans and others placed in distress by the explosion\\" and an appeal advertised in The Times newspaper. Inquest The coroner's inquest was not heard until 23 September 1886 so that John Woolley, who had survived the explosion, could give evidence. The coalface where the explosion occurred was being worked on the retreating principle. Headings had been driven into the coal and a working face established between them. As the coal was worked back along the headings, waste material accumulated in the goaf or gob behind it. Pit props were progressively removed and the roof was allowed to subside into the goaf a short distance behind the working face. Woolley was removing pit props when the fracturing roof released firedamp. The flame in Woolley's Davy lamp turned blue indicating explosive gas. Instead of reporting it, work continued. A few minutes later the flame in the lamp of a nearby miner \\"fired\\". Established procedure was \\"lowering his lamp to the floor [firedamp is lighter than air] and taking it steadily into the fresh air, avoiding jerks\\". Instead the miner shook it and attempted to blow it out at which point the flame passed through the gauze and caused the explosion. The verdict of the coroner's jury was accidental death caused by an explosion of firedamp. The coroner commented that the fireman should spend more time examining the workings before the men went down the pit and that greater care should be taken examining the lamps. It was regretted that the gas was not reported by the prop-takers. Subsequently, the colliery owners bought 150 Masault lamps and 50 improved Clanny lamps which had bonnets fitted. The effect of the bonnet was to protect the gauze from draughts and reduce the risk of the flame passing through.

It was built in 1916 in a Colonial Revival design credited to architect James Knox Taylor. It remained in service as a U.S. Post Office until 1977, after which it has housed a variety of commercial tenants. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979 for its local significance in the theme of architecture. It was nominated for its status as Anoka's oldest surviving public building and most architecturally significant non-residential property. With Description The Anoka Post Office exhibits features of Colonial Revival architecture such as its rectangular plan, a brick exterior, symmetrical façades, a hip roof, and a dentillated cornice. The doorway has a central pediment and is set in the middle of three arched openings topped with keystones. Another key element of the style is the fanlight over the main entrance. History In the early 20th century, Anoka's former postmaster Irving Caswell served as editor of the Anoka Herald newspaper and James Knox Taylor had recently returned to private practice after serving as head of the Office of the Supervising Architect for the U.S. Treasury. In 1911 Casswell encouraged Taylor to launch a series of newspaper articles lobbying for the construction of a post office in Anoka. Taylor prevailed, and construction of the post office began in 1916. During its service as Anoka's post office, the building reflected the steady growth of the community. By 1925, the number of addresses receiving deliveries inside the city surpassed 600. Consequently, the postal service added a second mail carrier to the staff and divided the delivery into two routes. They measured growth by the number of transactions logged. In 1933 the Anoka Post Office handled $23,193.80 in receipts (). Five years later that number increased to $60,000 () and the facility employed eighteen workers. By 1954 the receipts totaled $103,055.94 () and the facility's employment had nearly quadrupled. The post office weathered more than just growth and expansion. In 1939 it was one of the few public buildings to withstand a devastating tornado that ripped through the area and served as gathering place for survivors of the destruction. During World War II the office achieved a \\"first class\\" rating. The distinction made it a choice location to purchase not only postage stamps but also war bonds to support the U.S. military's efforts overseas. The facility also served as a place for those of eligible age to register for the draft. Post-war growth and the demands of a vibrant community led to the construction of a new postal facility on Seventh Avenue. On October 22, 1977, the old Anoka Post Office delivered its last parcel of mail. Later use In 1978 the federal government put the site up for sale, and a year later it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The initial price tag and the costs associated with renovating and repurposing the building, however, prevented many, including the Anoka County Historical Society, from purchasing it. Counselor Realty finally stepped forward with a bid and a plan to restore much of the old building to its original grandeur. The greatest obstacle remained the building's old furnace, which required dismantling and updating from a coal heating system to a gas one. Over the next two years, the company spent $356,000 () on construction and restoration. Throughout the 1990s the building served as a multipurpose location. In addition to the real estate office, a number of businesses and firms cycled through the historic site, including a charter school, a Christian ministry center, a gym, and a coin shop. By 2000 the old post office had evolved once more into a retail space, creating a need for further updates to make the property attractive to shoppers. Interior fountains, along with mural paintings, were installed while the exterior received a flower garden that enhanced the landscape surrounding the building. Over the next fifteen years, the post office housed a tea room, a bridal shop, antique dealers, and a massage parlor. Throughout that time, Counselor Realty remained the one constant fixture. Anoka's Post Office building made national news in September 2004, when President George W. Bush visited the site while campaigning for re-election. Bush spent twenty minutes signing autographs, visiting with the public, and posing for photos. Despite his presidential standing, he discovered his order for an egg salad sandwich at the site's delicatessen could not be fulfilled. Instead, he opted for the special of the day and appeared content. In 2002 the United States Postal Service officially recognized Anoka as a Sesquicentennial station. It produced a stamp featuring a design of the historic post office which became a coveted souvenir. Anoka County's 150th anniversary, in 2007, created another opportunity for a special event and in 2016 yet a third as the building itself celebrated a centennial anniversary. As of 2018 the building houses Emerald Isle Antiques & Gifts.

Opened in 1849, the station forms part of the Turin–Genoa and Castagnole–Asti–Mortara railways, and is also a junction for two other lines, to Genoa and Chivasso, respectively. The station is currently managed by Rete Ferroviaria Italiana (RFI). However, the commercial area of the passenger building is managed by Centostazioni. Train services are operated by Trenitalia. Each of these companies is a subsidiary of Ferrovie dello Stato (FS), Italy's state-owned rail company. History The station was opened on 15 November 1849, upon the inauguration of the Trofarello–Asti section of the Turin–Genoa railway. Features Structures The passenger building made up of three components, distinct from each other, and connected by a glass tunnel. The main part of the building is a rectangular structure and comprises two levels, of which only the ground floor is open to the public. There are some shops and business services in the glass house connecting the main body with the two side buildings. These buildings are very similar to each other: rectangular in shape, on two levels, and constructed of whitewashed masonry. Yards The station yard consists of eight tracks, one of which (number four) has no platform. All of the other tracks, ranging from one through eight, have a platform protected by a long wrought iron canopy. These platforms are connected by an underpass. Each is equipped with several monitors that display information about arrival and departure of trains. There are many other tracks, not electrified, that are dedicated to goods service. The station also has a goods yard, and a major locomotive depot with a turntable. View over Asti railway station tracks Renovations In 2006, work was completed on the renovation of the passenger building. The work was co-financed by RFI and Centostazioni to the extent of €2.8 million, and comprised the following: renovation of the atrium, replacement of flooring, replacement of windows, renovation of the waiting room, removal of architectural barriers, installation of tactile paving, restoration of the exterior facade, and the transfer of the toilets from the eastern to the western side of the building. Associated renovations to the square in front of the passenger building were funded by the comune, with a budget of €204,000. These renovations involved the breaking down of architectural barriers, the installation of additional street furniture, and the remodelling of interchange areas. Passenger and train movements The station has around 6 million passenger movements each year. There are about 163 trains per day. The trains stopping at Asti are InterCity, express and regional trains. Their main destinations are Turin, Alessandria and Acqui Terme. Interchange In front of the passenger building is a small parking lot and a sign indicating telephone numbers for taxis. The station also has a bus terminal. The service provider is GTT, and the main destinations of the buses are Canale, Cisterna and Cerrina.

Developed beginning in 1834, it was the first place in Rockville to be developed industrially, and the surviving buildings provide a view of evolutionary changes in mill architecture. The mill was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. It was converted into an apartment complex in 2016 by the state. Description and history The Minterburn Mill complex is located in the northeast corner of Vernon, roughly at the point where the Hockanum River, the historic source of the mill's power, enters the town. It is a complex of four buildings and a concrete dam, built between 1834 and 1906. The main building, originally the Rockville Warp Building, is a large stone structure, 3-1/2 stories in height, which was built in 1834, and is a well-preserved Greek Revival structure. Building 2, the Minterburn Mill, is a four-story structure built in 1906 that is one of the earliest uses of reinforced concrete in an industrial setting. and The site's industrial history dates to at least the 18th century, when an iron works and a gin distillery were documented at the site. In the late 18th century George Hall established a fulling mill. Rockville's first textile mill was built downstream in 1821, and its proprietors purchased Hall's water privilege and land in 1834. The Rockville Warp Building dates to this time; the proprietors also built a stone dam, which was later replaced by the present concrete dam. The mill produced cotton warps used for yarn and satinet production in a number of Rockville's mills. In 1906, the plant was purchased by the Minterburn Mills, which built the new dam and Building 2. That company produced woolen and worsted fabrics until it closed in 1952. The plant was then bought by Roosevelt Mills, which produced knitwear at least into the 1970s.

It was built in 1847 on the east bank of the Mississippi River and has served variously as an inn, a logging camp office, a private home, a dairy farm, a post office, and a summer home. With It is now owned by Anoka County and houses the non-profit Banfill-Locke Center for the Arts. The building stands within Manomin County Park, and the art center is a partner site of the Mississippi National River and Recreation Area. The Banfill Tavern was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976 for its local significance in the theme of architecture. It was nominated for being one of the earliest and best preserved frame Greek Revival houses in Anoka County. Description The Banfill Tavern is located on a wooded site near the mouth of Rice Creek. Its floor plan follows an \\"L\\" shape. It exhibits Greek Revival style through such architectural features as the six-over-six pane double-hung windows, a tripartite formal entry consisting of a central door with sidelights and a transom, broken-pedimented gables, corner pilasters, and slender brick chimneys. As of 2017, both the interior and exterior of the home remain essentially unaltered. The interior consists of a large communal room on the first floor that contains an entryway, dining room, living room, kitchen, and service room. Seven interconnected rooms make up the second floor. The entire structure lacks any form of modern central heating. Instead stoves feeding into three chimneys provide warmth. History Built in 1847 by John Banfill, the building initially served as an inn and a base for logging operations northwest of Saint Anthony Falls. Due to its proximity to Minnesota's first Territorial Road and the Red River Trails, the inn became a popular rest stop for travelers. John Banfill was elected to the Minnesota State Senate for the 1st Minnesota Legislature in 1848. An account provided by E. S. Seymour, a visitor to the tavern in 1849, reveals that in its first years of operation the popular stop lacked adequate stable space. Consequently, many travelers' horses and mules remained in the open during the winter of 1848–1849. By the time of Seymour's visit, Banfill had expanded his stall space to accommodate forty horses and mules. Another visitor complimented Banfill on his \\"good old sparkling Madeira\\". Travelers filled the Banfill house every night on their way to destinations along the road, including Fort Gaines (renamed Fort Ripley in 1850), the Chippewa Agency, and trading posts, in addition to private homes. Between 1857 and 1875 it is uncertain who owned the property. In 1876, however, William F. Brown married Laura M. Locke and purchased it. The couple maintained a dairy herd and lived in the house while Brown also worked as postmaster until his death in 1887. His wife and children lived in the house until 1912, when Laura sold it to her brother, Cassius M. Locke. Locke and his wife Roberta Pratt Locke raised registered Jersey cattle on the farm and used it as a summer home. They made a few additions to the house, including front and rear porches, kitchen and bathroom electrical service, a pump, a water closet, and a sewage disposal system. Most of these improvements took place in the 1930s. Cassius Locke died in 1947 and Roberta in 1959. The property remained unoccupied until 1967, when Anoka County purchased it. In 1988 an art center founded in 1979 forged a public–private partnership with the county to move into Banfill Tavern after outgrowing its original site. The Banfill-Locke Center for the Arts uses the facility in support of established and developing artists by hosting speakers, classes, and residents in addition to gallery space.

It is surrounded by high mountains. The river of Chitral flows along the village to its east. Yarkoon valley and Mastuj are situated at the north and south respectively. Population and people Around 2000 people live in the village. The people speak the Chitrali language. The inhabitants settled there many centuries ago. Four major tribes live in the village: Khoshwaqt, Sheghniye, Syed and Qaziye. Apart from these tribes, few people had migrated from Molkhow, Pashk, Bang, and Rach in the mid of 20 century. Education The literacy rate is almost 70%; the rate is 100% in the young generation, but people above the age of 50 are less educated due to having no special education system at that time. At that time only one primary school was present, but today there are three schools. These are playing their role in educating the people of the area. The Agha Khan school is playing an especially important role in educating girls, that is why the literacy rate among girls is equal to the literacy rate of boys.

Although the single-entity league does not have true free agency, the re-entry draft was created to provide an outlet of internal movement for veteran players. History The Re-Entry Draft was created by the collective bargaining agreement reached in March 2010. Under the previous rules, clubs could hold what amounted to a 48-hour first right of refusal on players whose contracts had expired or did not have the options picked up. This was a significant obstacle to a new agreement during negotiations during the 2009-10 MLS offseason. With the players threatening to strike, the league and owners agreed to add the suggested re-entry draft to provide some leverage to players. The re-entry draft was praised by some for increasing freedom and flexibility of player movement, with agents and players arguing that it provided checks on teams who previously could either force a player to take a lower salary or make them seek options outside of MLS. Others, however, criticized the relative lack of players actually moving and the rushed nature of the process, which took place by conference call. The first re-entry draft, consisting of two stages, took place over several weeks following the completion of the 2010 MLS season. Two players were chosen in Stage 1 of the draft with an additional eleven players chosen in the second stage, including World Cup veterans Jimmy Conrad, Josh Wolff, and Frankie Hejduk; designated player Juan Pablo Ángel, and Jeff Cunningham, then the second-leading scorer in league history. Process Teams are able to select players who meet the following criteria: * Players who are at least 23 years old and have a minimum of three years of MLS experience whose options were not exercised by their clubs (available at option salary for the next season). * Players who are at least 25 years old with a minimum of four years of MLS experience who are out of contract and whose club does not offer them a contract at their previous salary (available at previous season's salary). * Players who are at least 30 years old with a minimum of eight years of MLS experience who are out of contract and whose club does not wish to re-sign them (available for at least 105 percent of their previous season's salary). Players with expiring contracts or options that are not renewed by their clubs who do not meet the age and service requirements necessary to be included in the Re-Entry Draft are instead available in the Waiver Draft. The draft order is determined by a reverse combination of the teams' playoff and regular season positions, similar to the MLS SuperDraft, with any expansion clubs picking last. Each club may either select a player from the eligible player list or pass. Once a club chooses to pass, they may no longer participate in that stage of the Re- Entry Process. Each stage continues until all clubs have passed on the available players. Stage 1 Clubs may not select their own players in Stage 1. If a club selects a player in Stage 1, it must exercise the option for, or extend a Bona Fide Offer to, the player. If the player rejects the offer, the drafting club will hold the right of first refusal for that player in MLS. Players with option years left on their contract are automatically added to the drafting club’s roster. Any player selected in Stage 1 will remain on that years drafting club’s budget at the option price or Bona Fide Offer price until April 1 of the following year. Clubs and players may not mutually renegotiate that price to a lower number until April 1 of that year. For several days after Stage 1, clubs may sign their own players or sign and trade a player to another club (provided the old club, new club, and player agree to the new terms). A blackout period then begins before Stage 2 takes place one week following Stage 1. Stage 2 In Stage 2, clubs may select from players that are under contract and those not under contract. If a player is not under contract, the drafting club will be required to make a genuine offer to the player within seven days. In the event that an agreement cannot be reached between the drafting club and an out-of-contract player, the drafting club will hold the right of first refusal for that player in MLS. Clubs may select their own players in the Stage 2 draft only after all other clubs have declined to select those players. If a player is not selected in either stage of the Re-Entry Process, that player will be available on a first-come, first-served basis to all clubs.

The political initiative with which he is most widely identified was the Contract With America, which outlined an economic and social agenda designed to improve the efficiency of government while reducing its burden on the American taxpayer. Passage of the Contract helped establish Gingrich's reputation as a public intellectual. His engagement of public issues has continued through to the present, in particular as the founder of American Solutions for Winning the Future. Gingrich's policy reach covers everything from national security to personal responsibility, but Gingrich has been known to take stances that are different from the traditional Republican line. For instance, on immigration, he favors a strong border policy but also favors a guest worker program. He also supports the idea of electing presidents with the national popular vote instead of the Electoral College. Gingrich has authored or co- authored 16 non-fiction books since 1982, several of them bestsellers. In recent years, his works have had a more large-scale policy focus, including Winning the Future, and the most recent, To Save America. In recent years, Gingrich has identified education as \\"the number one factor in our future prosperity\\", and received national attention for partnering with Al Sharpton and Education Secretary Arne Duncan to promote the issue. \\"Replacement of the Left\\" On November 18, 2010, Gingrich delivered a speech before the Republican Governors Association Conference in San Diego outlining 12 steps for what he called a \\"Replacement of the Left\\" strategy. In his speech, Gingrich said that the Republican election day victories of 2009 and 2010 should be followed by further victories over the next two years that would give the Republican party a large enough majority to replace what he called an increasingly leftist political system that has dominated American politics since 1932, largely through the influence of unelected bureaucracies. According to Gingrich, the strategy would be best pursued at the local level by lawmakers and activists in all 50 states rather than relying on leaders in Washington, D.C. The 12 steps cover economic issues and entitlement reform, as well as education reform from K-12 through the collegiate level, including a \\"parents right to know\\" standards in education notifications. Specific steps address tying unemployment compensation to job training programs, replacing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) with state-based healthcare solutions and implementing ideas from business leaders to reduce the overall cost of government. In December 2010, Gingrich began hosting the first of five scheduled Internet seminars to educate state lawmakers across the country about how to begin implementing the strategy before the 2012 elections. Domestic policy Abortion Gingrich is generally regarded as a pro-life candidate. The policy section of Gingrich's 2012 campaign web site states that he would \\"end taxpayer subsidies for abortion by repealing Obamacare, defunding Planned Parenthood, and reinstating the 'Mexico City Policy' which banned funding to organizations that promote and/or perform abortions overseas\\". In 1995, when he was Speaker of the House, Gingrich advocated taxpayer funding of abortion services in cases of rape, incest, or protecting the life of the mother. In 1998, influential Christian broadcaster James Dobson criticized Gingrich for not working hard enough to eliminate funding for family-planning programs.Christian broadcaster blasts Republicans' failed attempts Houston Chronicle October 25, 1998 Gingrich has since modified his position to oppose federal funding of abortions in all cases. In an interview with Jake Tapper of ABC News in late 2011, Gingrich stated that he believed life began at \\"implantation\\".Tapper, Jake (December 2, 2011). \\"Gingrich Breaks from Some in Anti-Abortion Community on When Life Begins\\". ABC News. He has been criticized by socially conservative Republican presidential primary opponents Rick Santorum and Michele Bachmann for not consistently supporting the position that life begins at conception.Morrill, Jim (December 3, 2011). \\"Bachmann says Gingrich's stance on abortion is 'troubling. The Republic (Columbus, IN). McClatchy-Tribune. On December 12, 2011, he wrote to the board of The Family Leader that he \\"believes that life begins at conception\\". He promised on the first day of work as president to \\"sign an executive order reinstating Ronald Reagan's Mexico City policy that prevents taxpayer dollars from being used to fund abortions overseas\\"; he will \\"repeal Obamacare, defund Planned Parenthood\\".http://www.thefamilyleader.com/former-speaker-newt-gingrich- provides-written-response-to-the-family-leaders-marriage-pledge Judiciary In 2011, while campaigning for the Republican nomination for president, Gingrich became the \\"loudest and fiercest critic\\" among a Republican field of \\"judicial-branch haters,\\" frequently criticizing federal judges and judges.Ginger Gibson, Newt Gingrich courting Iowa voters with judicial rants, Politico (December 21, 2011). In December 2011, Gingrich termed the courts \\"grotesquely dictatorial and far too powerful\\" and said that as president, he would abolish whole courts whose decisions he disagrees with, asking \\"Are we forced for a lifetime to keep someone on the bench who is so radically anti-American that they are a threat to the fabric of the country?\\"Gardner, Amy; DeLong, Matt (December 17, 2011). Newt Gingrich's assault on 'activist judges' draws criticism, even from the right. The Washington Post.David G. Savage, Newt Gingrich says he'd defy Supreme Court rulings he opposed, Los Angeles Times (December 17, 2011). Gingrich has particularly singled out the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals for criticism, saying that it should be abolished because it is too liberal and \\"radically Anti-American.\\"Amanda Terkel, Newt Gingrich: Abolish Liberal, 'Anti-American' Courts, Huffington Post (December 16, 2011). Gingrich has said that if elected president, he would defy Supreme Court rulings that he opposed, citing the 2008 decision in Boumediene v. Bush as an example. Gingrich also said that if president, he might ignore a Supreme Court ruling recognizing a constitutional right to same-sex marriage. Gingrich has frequently criticized what he termed \\"judicial activism\\" and in an appearance on Face the Nation in 2011 suggested that Congress should subpoena federal judges and force them to explain themselves before Congress.Andrew Cohen, Gingrich's Dangerous Plan to Subpoena Federal Judges, Part II, The Atlantic (October 11, 2011). When host Bob Schieffer asked how he would force federal judges to comply with congressional subpoenas, Gingrich said he would send the U.S. Capitol Police or U.S. Marshals to arrest the judges and force them to testify. Gingrich's proposal drew criticism across the political spectrum. Harvard Law School professor Laurence Tribe (who described it as \\"a frontal assault on the independence of the federal judiciary\\" and \\"one of the craziest and most obviously unconstitutional things the former Speaker has ever proposed\\"), prominent conservative lawyer Bruce Fein (who wrote that \\"Gingrich unwittingly is proposing to overthrow the Constitution that he would be pledged to uphold and defend if elected\\"), and U.S. District Judge John L. Kane (who wrote that Gingrich's proposal would contravene the rule of law and the notion of judicial independence as set forth in Federalist No. 78). Eventual 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, former Republican Attorneys General Michael Mukasey and Alberto Gonzales, conservative attorney Edward Whelan and the nonpartisan Justice at Stake group all criticized Gingrich's comments for similar reasons. Gingrich has stated that he believes the Warren Court misinterpreted Marbury v. Madison in its Cooper v. Aaron decision and went too far in asserting that only the Supreme Court has final and binding interpretive authority over the two other branches of the federal government in defining the meaning of the Constitution.Newt Gingrich: 'A dangerous despotism', USA Today, December 19, 2011.Bringing the Courts Back Under the Constitution, Newt 2012, November 7, 2011. Child labor laws Gingrich has said that children should be able to work at an earlier age. He said: \\"You say to somebody, you shouldn't go to work before you're what, 14, 16 years of age, fine,\\" Mr. Gingrich said. \\"You're totally poor. You're in a school that is failing with a teacher that is failing. I've tried for years to have a very simple model. Most of these schools ought to get rid of the unionized janitors, have one master janitor and pay local students to take care of the school. The kids would actually do work, they would have cash, they would have pride in the schools, they'd begin the process of rising.\\" He later clarified his position, saying he was not proposing major changes in the law or encouraging children to seek jobs instead of attending school, but rather was \\"talking about working 20 hours a week and being empowered to succeed\\". Campaign finance regulation Gingrich opposes restrictions on campaign contributions, which he says make \\"it impossible for a candidate of average means to go out and raise the resources\\" needed for a campaign. In a 2006 article in the National Review, Gingrich stated that current campaign finance rules have moved the U.S. \\"dangerously closer to a plutocracy where the highest bidder can buy a seat.\\" Gingrich opposed the McCain–Feingold campaign finance reform bill, which was passed in 2002 and prohibits unrestricted donations to candidates from wealthy individuals, corporations and labor unions. In his book Winning the Future, Gingrich criticized McCain-Feingold for creating a \\"more irresponsible\\" system than before its passage, in which 527s and other extra-campaign activities increased, and \\"rich people ironically had an even greater impact\\" on elections. Among other unintended consequences, Gingrich writes, the election process has \\"devolved into an incumbency protection racket\\", whereby lobbyists and PACs raise large amounts of money for incumbents, discourage potential opponents, which frees incumbents to \\"spend more time at Washington PAC fundraisers\\". In addition, McCain–Feingold's \\"ridiculously low contribution limits\\" require candidates to spend even more time focused on raising money. He has called for a system where individuals are allowed to donate unlimited amounts to Congressional candidates within their district, however requiring that all donations be reported online immediately. Drug policy In 1982, Gingrich wrote a letter supporting medical marijuana,\\"Newt Gingrich's Letter Supporting Medical Marijuana\\". National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws. Retrieved January 26, 2012. a position he later abandoned. While serving in Congress, Gingrich introduced H.R. 4170, the Drug Importer Death Penalty Act of 1996. The legislation would have required a court to sentence a first time drug importer to life in prison or a multiple-time offender to death.http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi- bin/query/z?c104:H.R.4170:http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h104-4170 In a November 2011 interview, Gingrich reaffirmed his support for giving the death penalty to some drug smugglers, such as cartel leaders, and said \\"we need to think through a strategy that makes it radically less likely that we're going to have drugs in this country\\". He commented that places with \\"very draconian\\" drug policies like Singapore have been the most successful at doing that. Education Gingrich favors rigorous mathematics and science instruction in public schools, introducing competition between schools and between teachers, and permitting public school prayer. In 2009 Gingrich teamed with two unlikely allies to promote their shared view of education reform: civil rights activist Al Sharpton, and the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Education, Arne Duncan. After the three had visited a number of U.S. schools that were implementing education reforms, on November 15, 2009 they appeared together on NBC's Sunday morning news and interview program Meet the Press. During their interview Gingrich said that \\"education is the number one factor in our future prosperity, it's the number one factor in national security and it's the number one factor in [our] young people having a decent future. I agree with Al Sharpton, this is the number one civil right of the 21st century.\\" Gingrich's 2010 book To Save America: Stopping Obama's Secular- Socialist Machine, the chapter co-authored by Lisa Keegan, Nancy Sinnott Dwight, and Fred Asbell, states, \\"We must be an intellectually hungry, morally strong, and urgently demanding nation with an education system capable of responding to a voracious American desire to learn.\\" To Save America: Stopping Obama's Secular-Socialist Machine. With Joe DeSantis.p. 289, Regnery Publishing, May 2010  Electoral College  In 2014, Gingrich sent a letter to Dr. John Koza of National Popular Vote, Inc. endorsing the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, under which presidents would be elected by the national popular vote and not by the Electoral College. Energy policy On energy policy, Gingrich is most closely associated with proposals that would increase domestic energy production, and with opposition to policies that would increase energy costs through regulation, taxation or international treaties that would limit energy production. He has described his approach to finding new domestic energy sources as an all of the above' energy strategy\\". As Speaker of the House in 1998, Gingrich spoke out against a proposed federal gas tax. He has repeatedly stated that creating new energy regulations and taxes during an economic downturn would be a \\"recipe for disaster\\". Conversely, he has argued that lowering energy prices would create jobs and save Americans money. In 2009, Gingrich's organization American Solutions for Winning the Future launched a \\"Stop the Energy Tax\\" petition campaign which has collected over 230,000 signatures opposing the regulation of carbon by the Environmental Protection Agency and the enactment of any laws imposing \\"new energy taxes and/or establishing a national cap and trade system for carbon dioxide\\". Gingrich has opposed Barack Obama's proposed Cap-and- Trade legislation. In April 2009 he gave testimony before the House Energy and Commerce Committee, saying it would have no impact on global temperatures while simultaneously hurting the American economy. Also in 2008, American Solutions launched a widely noted campaign, \\"Drill Here. Drill Now. Pay Less.\\" The group began circulating an online petition calling for the government to authorize new drilling onshore and offshore in an effort to lower gas and diesel prices. The petition drew over 1,450,000 signatures. In September 2008, the group took credit for helping to influence Congress' decision to lift its 25-year ban on offshore drilling. Gingrich also published Drill Here, Drill Now, Pay Less: A Handbook for Slashing Gas Prices and Solving Our Energy Crisis, which outlines a plan for reducing both gas prices and America's dependence on foreign oil. Throughout the book, Gingrich argues that gas prices and overall rising energy costs are a reflection of bad government policy rather than a scarcity of resources. Gingrich proposes tapping into American oil reserves along with pursuing other energy resources including nuclear, coal and renewable energy resources. Gingrich is an advocate of a flex-fuel mandate for automobiles sold in the United States.Adler, Jonathan (January 26, 2011) Newt Hearts Ethanol, National Review He has stated that flex-fuel vehicles are important for national security, while also providing greater competition in the fuel market and improving consumer choice. Gingrich's advocacy of ethanol has been criticized by some conservative publications, including National Review and the Wall Street Journal.Professor Cornpone, The Wall Street Journal, January 30, 2011 Beginning in February 2012, Gingrich responded to the rising price of gasoline nationwide by emphasizing his proposal for American energy independence as a major theme of his campaign.Gingrich Focuses on Gas Prices Wall Street Journal, February 21, 2012. In a letter published by Human Events, Gingrich called for dramatically expanding the federal land open for oil and gas production with the stated goal of increasing supply. Citing oil prices of $1.13 a gallon on average from 1995 to 1999, and $1.89 a gallon when President Obama took office, Gingrich suggested $2.50 a gallon could be an attainable price with policies that permitted the maximum increase in gasoline production.$2.50 gallon gasoline and energy independence Human Events, February 15, 2012. On February 19, 2011, in an appearance on Fox News Sunday, Gingrich was critical of the Obama administration's energy policies and accused the president of being \\"anti- American–energy.\\"Newt Gingrich on resurrecting his presidential campaign; Eric Cantor talks payroll tax holiday Fox News, February 19, 2012.

Entitlement reform In writings, speeches and interviews, Gingrich has argued that Medicaid, Medicare, Social Security, and other entitlement programs are fiscally unsustainable. Without reform, according to Gingrich, this will cause major financial problems, such as large benefit reductions or massive tax increases. In order to avoid these outcomes, Gingrich supports what he calls a \\"replacement approach\\" to entitlement reform. He argues that entitlement programs need fundamental restructuring in order to strengthen incentives for work and productivity. Gingrich cites the reform of Aid to Families with Dependent Children passed in the 1990s as a model for future policymaking. Gingrich has argued that the current welfare and unemployment insurance system continues to create work disincentives that trap people in poverty. He has proposed replacing these systems with an offer of guaranteed employment for the able-bodied, preferably in the private sector to save taxpayer money, or retraining. Beneficiaries who work enough hours would receive Medicare vouchers and housing assistance. He also supports personal accounts for Social Security and Medicare, funded using the employee's portion of FICA payroll taxes, to replace all or part of the benefits paid under the current system. According to Gingrich, private accounts would offer workers retirement and medical benefits much better than what these programs currently offer while greatly reducing the need for government spending. In May 2011, following an appearance on Meet the Press, Gingrich was criticized by some conservatives for using the phrase \\"right-wing social engineering\\" in apparent reference to Rep. Paul Ryan's voucher system plan for Medicare. In later statements, Gingrich said he was speaking to a general principle that major reforms require the support of the American people, and offered support for Ryan's efforts to promote reform.Gingrich Admits 'Mistake' Over Ryan Medicare Comments, But Vows Not to Play Washington 'Trivial Pursuit' and 'Gotcha' Games, On the Record with Greta Van Susteren, May 17, 2011, Fox News.Newt Gingrich, Face the Nation, May 22, 2011, CBS News. Environment Gingrich describes himself as a \\"Teddy Roosevelt Republican\\" and has professed a deep interest in conservation and maintaining biological diversity. Before being elected to Congress, he taught an environmental studies class at West Georgia College, and while in office, he was known as one of the most environmentally conscious Republicans. Gingrich co-sponsored the reauthorization of the Endangered Species Act and supported the 1990 Clean Air Act and the Rhinoceros and Tiger Fund. In 2007, Gingrich released the book A Contract with the Earth, co-written with Terry Maple. In the book, Gingrich presented his policies for a market-based approach to environmentalism that incentivizes conservation and green technology, rather than relying on regulations or litigation. In particular, Gingrich has proposed using monetary prizes and tax incentives to spur environmentally friendly innovations, such as hydrogen engines, 100-mile-per-gallon conventional fuel engines and ethanol fuels that do not rely on corn or cane sugar. In January 2011, Gingrich proposed the Environmental Protection Agency be replaced with a new organization called the Environmental Solutions Agency, which would be \\"dedicated to bringing together science, technology, entrepreneurs, incentives and local creativity to create a cleaner environment through smarter regulation\\". Gingrich criticized the EPA for focusing only on regulations and litigation, rather than innovation. He said the new agency's major energy projects would be working on developing clean coal and rewriting regulations governing the development of small nuclear plants. =Climate change= According to Science magazine, Gingrich changed his view on climate change \\"from cautious skeptic in the late 1980s to believer in the late 2000s to skeptic again during the [2016] campaign.\\" In February 2007 Gingrich stated that he \\"would strongly support\\" a cap and trade system for reducing carbon emissions based on the success of the Acid Rain Program enacted by Congress during his tenure. He later changed his position, saying that such a trading system \\"would lead to corruption, political favoritism, and would have a huge impact on the economy\\".Amira, Dan (November 15, 2011). \\"The Many Egregious Flip-flops of Newt Gingrich \\".

In April 2007 Gingrich called for \\"Green conservatism\\" and carbon-reduction tax credits.Newt Gingrich (23 April 2007), \\"We Can Have Green Conservatism -- And We Should\\" Human Events More recently Gingrich has expressed skepticism that mankind is significantly altering the climate and has preferred curbing carbon emissions through market-incentives instead of by taxes or cap-and-trade plans. He has opposed the Kyoto Protocol, stating that the protocols unfairly favor Europe, China and India to the disadvantage of the U.S. In 2008, Gingrich accepted an invitation from Al Gore to appear with Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in a commercial produced by one of Gore's climate advocacy organizations.Hirschfeld Davis, Julie (December 2, 2011) \\"How Gingrich Landed on Love Seat With Pelosi\\".

Fox News. In 2011, Gingrich said his appearance in the ad was \\"the dumbest single thing I've done\\". Free speech Gingrich opposed a Senate amendment to the Communications Decency Act of 1996 that banned \\"indecent\\" content from the Internet, saying it \\"is clearly a violation of free speech and it's a violation of the right of adults to communicate with each other\\". The amendment remained in the enacted legislation, but in Reno v. ACLU (1997) the Supreme Court struck it down. Gingrich was one of the 71 co- sponsors of a bill to reinstate the Fairness Doctrine after the Federal Communications Commission stopped enforcing the rule in 1987.Newt Gingrich Co- Sponsored the 1987 Pro-Fairness Doctrine Bill In 2006, he indicated that free speech might need to be curtailed to fight terrorism, saying \\"Either before we lose a city or, if we are truly stupid, after we lose a city, we will adopt rules of engagement that use every technology we can find to break up their capacity to use the Internet, to break up their capacity to use free speech, and to go after people who want to kill us to stop them from recruiting people.\\"Gingrich: Free Speech Should Be Curtailed To Fight Terrorism Health care Gingrich opposes the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA). Through his organization, American Solutions for Winning the Future, Gingrich organized an online petition that secured over 100,000 signatures to support its repeal in the United States House of Representatives. In February 2010, Gingrich and John C. Goodman, the founding president of the National Center for Policy Analysis, presented a 10-point consumer driven health care plan. Outlined in the Wall Street Journal, the plan proposes reforms to make health insurance more affordable, create alternatives to Medicare cuts, protect early retirees, cover the needs of the chronically ill, and protect doctors against frivolous lawsuits. In the book To Save America, also published in 2010, Gingrich described PPACA as \\"a dead end of higher taxes, bigger government, more bureaucracy and a decaying health system\\". With co- author Nancy Desmond, Gingrich outlined proposals for improving the American healthcare industry through a variety of means including: an overhaul of the U.S. medical research system that would reduce wastefulness, modernizing the FDA, eliminating Medicare fraud and abuse, and implementing a system of what they describe as \\"personalized medicine\\" that would improve care for individuals while reducing the costs associated with treatment. Gingrich has also called for transparency in the prices of medical devices, noting it is one of the few aspects or U.S. health care where consumers and federal health officials are \\"barred from comparing the quality, medical outcomes or price\\". Gingrich supported the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, creating the Medicare Part D federal prescription drugs benefit program. While he has received some criticism from conservatives over the cost of the plan, Gingrich has reiterated his support in years since, saying that it represented necessary modernization of the system, as Medicare was created in the 1960s, before pharmaceutical drugs were in widespread use. He also stated that the costs of providing medication must be balanced against the decreased need for medical procedures. The same year, Gingrich founded the Center for Health Transformation to develop and advocate for \\"transformational\\" solutions that improve the quality of care, lower costs and expand coverage to all Americans. The Center has played a role in opposing PPACA, arguing that the plan will increase costs for both taxpayers and consumers and expand insurance coverage by growing government. The Center has released a series of charts highlighting different aspects of the legislation, focusing on the 159 new bureaucratic organizations it would create; the ten- year implementation timeline of nearly 500 related deadlines, mandates and taxes; and a claimed 1,968 new and expanded powers granted to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. In an April 2006 newsletter the Center defended the individual mandate in Romneycare, describing \\"[i]ndividuals who can afford to purchase health insurance and simply choose not to\\" as \\"free-riders.\\"Brody Mullins and Janet Adamy, Gingrich Applauded Romney's Health Plan The Wall Street Journal December 27, 2011 In a May 15, 2011, interview with David Gregory on Meet the Press, Gingrich repeated his long-held belief that \\"all of us have a responsibility to pay – help pay for health care\\", and suggested this could be implemented by either a mandate to obtain health insurance or a requirement to post a bond ensuring coverage.Gingrich Supports 'Variation' on Obamacare-Type Health Insurance Mandate In the same interview he said: \\"I don't think right wing social engineering is any more desirable than left wing social engineering. I don't think imposing radical change from the right or the left is a very good way for a free society to operate.\\" This comment caused a great deal of back-lash within the Republican Party and from conservative pundits. Later, on his web site, he expanded on his comments by saying he believes the federal mandate contained in the PPACA is unconstitutional and that he believes individual states should be able to decide the best way to implement healthcare programs for their citizens. Jobs Gingrich generally favors policies intended to stimulate job growth through reductions in government regulations and federal taxes. In September 1994, Gingrich co-authored the Contract With America, which included the Job Creation and Wage Enhancement Act. The act advocated for capital gains cuts and strengthening the Regulatory Flexibility Act. His 1995 book, To Renew America, outlined related ideas, including employer initiatives to make employees key players in improving processes and products. Gingrich has also spoken out against unions, saying they prefer protection over competition, which hurts the economy. He has also argued that industry lawsuits lower the incentive to create jobs and invest in the American economy. Starting 2009, Gingrich's American Solutions advocacy organization launched a campaign called \\"Jobs Here. Jobs Now. Jobs First\\", also known as the \\"Real Jobs Tour\\", to address the issue of high unemployment levels, then approaching 10 percent across the United States. The plan put forth by the group outlined five major tax cuts to boost the American economy, including: a two-year, 50 percent reduction in payroll taxes; a 100 percent annual write-off for small businesses' new equipment purchases; adoption of the Irish corporate tax rate of 12.5 percent; and the abolishment of the estate tax and capital gains tax. In December 2009, Gingrich hosted a jobs summit to rival one held by President Obama, focusing on tax cuts and other market-oriented incentives to spur job growth. Gingrich has been a consistent opponent of Obama's economic policies, and in October 2010 took part in his own 11-city tour to criticize the White House's economic agenda. Lean Six Sigma Gingrich has embraced the Lean Six Sigma principles for waste management and espouses their use in reducing the federal deficit. He was introduced to Lean Six Sigma in 2007, and has since encouraged the use of the methods for corporate and government waste reduction. In June 2011, Gingrich was the first Republican presidential candidate to sign the Lean Six Sigma \\"Strong America Now\\" pledge. The pledge commits to reducing federal government spending and starting to pay down the national debt by 2017. In a speech to the Heritage Foundation in August 2011, he stated that the waste cutting methods should be used to address the deficit, and estimated that through their application the government could identify a $3 trillion saving over 10 years by December 2011. National security During a 2008 appearance at Huntington, New York, Gingrich said: \\"The more successful they've been at intercepting and stopping bad guys the less proof there is that we're in danger. The better they've done at making sure there isn't an attack the easier it is to say there was never going to be an attack anyway. It's almost as if they should every once in a while have allowed an attack to get through just to remind us.\\" He said: \\"I would divide the FBI into two agencies. I would have an anti-domestic crime FBI which was very cautious, very respectful of civil liberties, you are innocent until proven guilty. And I would have a small but very aggressive anti-terrorism agency. And I would frankly give them extraordinary ability to eavesdrop. And my first advice to civil libertarians is simple. Don't plot with terrorists.\\"Newt Gingrich's Urge to Terrify and Spy on AmericansThe Quotable Newt Gingrich Prison reform Gingrich supports prison reform; he has stated that spending on prisons is too high, and increasing incarceration is unsustainable. According to a Washington Post op-ed Gingrich co-authored with Pat Nolan, as a supporter of the conservative \\"Right on Crime Campaign\\", he is in favor of diverting funding from prisons to probation services and \\"proven community corrections approaches\\". In April 2011, Gingrich wrote to the NAACP in support of its call for criminal justice system reform. The letter emphasized the need for \\"humane alternatives\\" to incarceration and the potential for prison reform to create savings for taxpayers. He also placed emphasis on the impact of current criminal justice policies on communities and stated that he supports a reform that includes \\"policies that will strengthen the families, neighborhood institutions, and places of worship that we as conservatives believe are the central pillars of society.\\" Religion Speaking at the Cornerstone Church in San Antonio, Texas, on March 26, 2011, Gingrich said, \\"I have two grandchildren—Maggie is 11, Robert is 9. I am convinced that if we do not decisively win the struggle over the nature of America, by the time they're my age they will be in a secular atheist country, potentially one dominated by radical Islamists and with no understanding of what it once meant to be an American.\\" He referred to his decision to seek office again, pointing to a 2002 decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit that the phrase \\"under God\\" in the Pledge of Allegiance was unconstitutional, saying, \\"I had been watching the courts grow steadily more secular and steadily more anti-religious starting with the 1963 school prayer decision. But for some reason this particular decision struck me as so blindingly stupid, so profoundly un-American.\\" He added, \\"Bravery will come from our churches, our synagogues, everyday folks. It won't come from the elites. It won't [come from] those currently in power because if it could have come from them, it would have.\\" Gingrich has described Sharia (Islamic law) as a \\"mortal threat\\" and called for federal legislation that would ban its use throughout the United States.http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/01/17/newt- gingrich-muslim-president-sharia_n_1211521.html \\"Newt Gingrich: I'd Support A Muslim Running For President Only If They'd Commit To Give Up Sharia\\". The Huffington Post. January 17, 2012. Retrieved February 2, 2012. In November 2010, voters in Oklahoma considered a ballot measure banning Sharia from state courts. In a speech on July 29, 2010, at the American Enterprise Institute, he stated: \\"The fight against sharia and the maddrassas and mosques which teach hatred and fanaticism is the heart of the enemy movement from which the terrorists spring forth. ... One of the things I am going to suggest today is a federal law which says no court anywhere in the United States under any circumstance is allowed to consider Sharia as a replacement for American law.\\"\\"America at Risk: Camus, National Security, and Afghanistan\\", July 29, 2010 During a town hall meeting in South Carolina, after being asked whether he would endorse a Muslim for president, he replied that he would only do so if the person denounced sharia law or refused to impose it on others. In response to the Park51 controversy, Gingrich opposed the center and stated, \\"There should be no mosque near Ground Zero in New York so long as there are no churches or synagogues in Saudi Arabia. The time for double standards that allow Islamists to behave aggressively toward us while they demand our weakness and submission is over.\\" He also said, \\"We as Americans don't have to tolerate people who are supportive of violence against us, building something at the site of the violence.\\" His comment comparing the construction of the Islamic center with \\"putting a Nazi sign next to the Holocaust Museum\\", was criticized by conservative commentator Pat Buchanan. Same-sex marriage Although his half-sister, Candace Gingrich, is a lesbian LGBT rights advocate, Gingrich opposes gay marriage. Speaking in Iowa in 2011, Gingrich said he thinks marriage is between a man and a woman, and told reporters that he \\"would like to find ways to defend that view as legitimately and effectively as possible\\". He said that the U.S. government should be defending the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). His 2012 campaign web site says that he would \\"nominate conservative judges who are committed to upholding Constitutional limited government and understand that the role of the judges is to interpret the law, not legislate from the bench\\". Gingrich believes the Republican Party should accept the reality that several states allow same-sex marriage and accept the distinction between \\"a marriage in a church\\" and \\"a legal document issued by the state\\". Gingrich had been criticized for opposing same-sex marriage while having been married three times and divorced twice. Representative Barney Frank (D-Mass) said he looks \\"forward to debating, to take one important example, the Defense of Marriage Act with Mr. Gingrich. I think he is an ideal opponent for us, when we talk about just who it is, is threatening the sanctity of marriage.\\" Space exploration Gingrich is a lifelong astronautics enthusiast; he initially became fascinated with the United States/Soviet Union space race when he was a teenager. , he serves on the National Space Society Board of Governors. Gingrich is an advocate of space exploration technology, and has stated that the United States should place more emphasis on realizing landmark achievements in space exploration. He has been a vocal critic of NASA, which he has described as too bureaucratic, inefficient, and no longer able to foster ambitious projects such as the 1969 moon landing. He has cited the building of the International Space Station as an example of a program that developed too slowly and was too expensive and the Space Launch System as a pork barrel project. Gingrich advocates greater reliance on the private sector and recommends incentivizing innovation through tax credits and by allocating 10 percent of the Nasa budget for prizes. He also supports initiating federally regulated commercial launch services. According to Gingrich, these changes would allow NASA to focus on advanced technological development and exploratory research. Gingrich's vision for the future of American space programs includes further solar system exploration, space travel for consumers and a sustained civilization beyond earth. He got the nickname of Newt Skywalker for his ideas.The return of Newt Skywalker Gingrich advocates the formation of a permanent manned lunar base by 2020, the presumed end of his 2nd presidential term, and has tried to introduce legislation in 1981, the Northwest Ordinance for Space, that would enable the moon colony to become the 51st state upon reaching a population of 13,000 residents. The colony concept was called an \\"ambitious goal\\" by Neil deGrasse Tyson who criticized its reliance on the private sector which Tyson describes as unwilling to solely fund such exploratory efforts. Tyson went on to explain that public/private efforts such as NASA partnering with private companies is already happening. State bankruptcy option As an alternative to federal bailouts, Gingrich advocates revising federal law to allow states to voluntarily declare bankruptcy. In a Los Angeles Times opinion article co-written with former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, Gingrich argued such a provision would allow states to reorganize their finances and free them from contractual obligations, specifically with government employee unions. In the op-ed, Gingrich wrote that many government employee pension systems are \\"bloated, broken and underfunded\\" and are \\"perhaps the most significant hurdles for many states trying to restore fiscal health.\\" However, Gingrich also said the new laws must respect the sovereignty of the citizens of a state, as well as limit judicial power over the bankruptcy process. Stem cell research Gingrich supported stem cell research in the past,Gingrich’s Stem-Cell History but now opposes embryonic stem cell research.Gingrich had no problem with stem cell research a few years ago Taxes Gingrich favors keeping federal and state taxes as low as possible in order to encourage economic growth. He has stated that he believes the corporate tax rate in the United States is too high and inhibits economic growth and job creation. Pointing to emerging competitors such as India and China, which offer lower corporate tax rates than the United States, Gingrich has recommended the U.S. adopt something similar to Ireland's 12.5% corporate income tax. Gingrich opposes efforts by some Democrats to increase taxes on capital gains. Instead he proposes eliminating the capital gains tax entirely, for both individuals and businesses, to increase incentives for entrepreneurship. Gingrich is an opponent of inheritance taxes, referring to current policy as the \\"death tax\\", and argues that abolishing the inheritance tax will create \\"hundreds of thousands\\" of new jobs. Gingrich also views the estate tax as a form of double taxation. TARP In late 2008, Gingrich voiced his strong opposition to the Troubled Asset Relief Program. He described the $700 billion plan as \\"socialism\\" and \\"just wrong\\", saying that \\"it's likely to fail, and it's likely to make the situation worse over time.\\"Newt Gingrich - TARP Gingrich reiterated that the bailout was \\"essentially wrong\\" in other appearances on Fox News on September 23 and 24, 2008. Some commentators have speculated that he undercut John McCain by rallying the conservative elements in the House to vote no on the bailout. On September 29, 2008, Gingrich reversed course and stated that he would \\"reluctantly and sadly\\" support the program. He also called for then Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson to resign. He stated, \\"\\"The Bush Administration has now provided three case studies in arrogance, isolation, and destructiveness: Michael Brown during Hurricane Katrina, Ambassador Jerry Bremer in Baghdad, and Secretary Paulson at Treasury.\\"\\"Gingrich Switches Bailout Stance\\" Immigration Gingrich has advanced \\"a nuanced position\\" on immigration reform that emphasizes border security and enforcement of immigration laws, as well as expanded immigration and visa programs for law-abiding workers. In a 2006 article in National Review, he called for the formation of \\"an intelligent center-Right coalition\\" that \\"would be for both security and immigration, for accuracy in identity (including a voter card with id and a biometric worker visa card) and patriotic integration of those who want to become American.\\" In January 2011, Gingrich held a forum on Latino issues where he announced a goal to overhaul the country's immigration system so that every worker in the United States is legal within a decade. Gingrich has argued the first priority for immigration reform is tighter border control. He has pushed for Congress to pass a narrowly written emergency border bill to finish the border fence between the United States and Mexico in less than a year and have complete border control within two years. In addition to greater border control, Gingrich has advocated for measures to discourage the hiring and harboring of illegal immigrants, such as shifting Internal Revenue Service resources to audit companies that employ illegal immigrants and cutting off federal aid to cities, counties or states that refuse to enforce immigration laws. He has frequently argued for using credit card companies to develop identification cards and a real-time system to verify citizenship. Mr. Gingrich has proposed the building of a fence on the U.S.-Mexican border by Jan. 1, 2014, telling a Tea Party audience it was long overdue, \\"We won the entire second World War in 44 months, and now in 25 years we can't control the border when the entire Texas side of the border is a river.\\" Gingrich has been generally opposed to the mass deportation of illegal immigrants, but he has also decried complete amnesty, calling instead for \\"a humanitarian period of transition as we replace an illegal channel of immigration with a legal one.\\" For example, he advocates using different rules for immigrants who came to the United States as children than those who came as adults, and he has called some parts of the DREAM Act \\"useful\\", although he objects to other parts of the bill. He has said the primary targets for deportation should be felons and gang members. Gingrich supports an expanded temporary worker program, with a special open- ended visa for high value workers. He believes workers who immigrated illegally but have family and a clean criminal record should have first opportunity to get temporary worker visas, but they should be required to return to their country of origin to get the visa. Gingrich is an advocate of making English the national language of the United States. He supports offering intensive English education to immigrants wishing to learn and has called for requiring immigrants to pass a test on American history in English. He also has said that immigrants should give up the right to vote in other countries to become an American citizen. Gingrich said in a CNN debate held November 22, 2011 that: \\"I don't see how the party that says it's the party of the family is going to adopt an immigration policy which destroys families that have been here a quarter century.\\" He also said: \\"And I'm prepared to take the heat for saying, let's be humane in enforcing the law without giving them citizenship but by finding a way to create legality so that they are not separated from their families.\\"Newt Gingrich Sticks Neck Out On Immigration, Risking Conservative Backlash Foreign policy Gingrich and President Ronald Reagan in 1985 Speaker Newt Gingrich, Congressman Jay Kim and Ed Royce (R-Calif.) face North Korea from the Joint Security Area in 1997 Gingrich has called for a stronger foreign policy, along the lines of the \\"Reagan model\\" of toughness\\", having been critical of the \\"weakness\\" of recent administrations' policies. In 2006 Gingrich criticized George W. Bush's stance toward North Korea and Iran, stating that it was \\"a form of appeasement\\". He said, \\"We have accepted the lawyer-diplomatic fantasy that talking while North Korea builds bombs and missiles while the Iranians build bombs and missiles is progress.\\" He has also severely criticized the foreign policy of President Obama for being too weak. Gingrich singled out Obama's responses to terrorism, North Korea, and Iran as particularly problematic. On North Korea he said, \\"There was amazing symbolism in North Korea deciding to launch a missile the very day President Obama was speaking to Europeans about his fantasy of nuclear disarmament. The West has talked with North Korea for over 15 years and they just keep building nuclear weapons and missiles. We have been talking with the Iranians for a decade and they continue to build nuclear capability and missiles.\\" Middle East =Afghanistan= Gingrich strongly supports the War in Afghanistan even though at times Gingrich has stated that the war in Afghanistan might not end well. Gingrich also stated in June 2011, \\"There is a radical Islamist war against America and our allies. It would be helpful if President Obama had found time in his speech tonight to explain to the American people how we are going to win this war. Giving a speech in isolation about our military operations in Afghanistan without explaining how it connects with a larger strategy for winning the war against radical Islamists does not help Americans understand what it will take to provide for the security of the American people.\\" =Egypt= Gingrich has been very critical of Obama's handling of the crisis in Egypt, and has warned of the possibility that Egypt might \\"go the way of Iran\\". Gingrich said, \\"I think this is a period of tremendous challenge and is a sign of the general failure of our strategy of not dealing with radical Islamists and not being honest and aggressive of what's going on around the world.\\" Gingrich also said that the Obama administration had failed to take the Middle East seriously and that Obama's 2009 speech in Cairo designed to improve relations with the Muslim world was a mistake. Gingrich said, \\"The president went to Cairo and gave his famous speech in which he explained that we should all be friends together because we're all the same people doing the same things and there are no differences between us. Well, I think there are a lot of differences between the Muslim Brotherhood and the rest of us.\\" =Iran= In a November 2011 presidential candidates' debate, Gingrich \\"called for replacing the leadership of Iran and said that could be accomplished within a year\\".O'Connor, Patrick; Barnes, Julian E. (November 24, 2011) \\"Gingrich Calls for Regime Change in Iran\\" The Wall Street Journal. Retrieved 2012-03-01. In a 2009 speech to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), he had called for the withdrawal of funds from Durban II, suspending Iran's right to vote at the United Nations and cutting off supplies of gasoline to Iran in order to force regime change. Gingrich has also said he would \\"wage real cyber warfare\\" to initiate a regime change in Iran and would be prepared to use military force, as a last resort, to keep Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.Easley, Jonathan (November 22, 2011) At the December 2011 New Hampshire GOP debate, Gingrich said that the idea of a bombing campaign to accurately take out all of Iran's nuclear program is \\"a fantasy. It would be a gigantic mess, with enormous collateral civilian casualties.\\"Ottens, Nick (December 20, 2011) Gingrich told the New Hampshire Union Leader in November 2011 that before agreeing to military action, he would first promote covert action and cyber warfare, fund dissident groups and wage economic warfare to effect regime change. =Iraq= Gingrich had also been generally supportive of the war in Iraq. He had also strongly opposed attempts to set timetables for withdraw and compared such measures to legislating defeat. =Israel= As an informal adviser to the Pentagon in June 2003, Gingrich prepared a six-page memo for Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld. In the document, he outlined \\"Seven Strategic Necessities\\" for U.S. policy in the Middle East following the invasion of Iraq. His suggestions included advice on how to approach ongoing conflicts between Israel and the Palestinians, noting that \\"America does not have a doctrine for total war against an enemy who is hiding behind a civilian population.\\" According to The Washington Post, Rumsfeld \\"put a small check next to that paragraph\\". In a 2009 speech to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), Gingrich called for creating an alternative to Hamas in the Gaza Strip. In a December 2011 interview, Gingrich referred to the Palestinians as \\"an invented people\\" and called the Israeli-Palestinian peace process a \\"delusional\\" undertaking. He confirmed these statements in the Republican Presidential Debate on December 10, 2011, adding that he considers both Fatah and Hamas to be terrorist organizations. He has also said that there is no Palestinian right of return.Younes, Ali. \\"Gingrich on a Muslim American president and a Palestinian state.\\" Al Arabiya News, 23 January 2012. =Libya= During the 2011 Libyan civil war, Gingrich changed his position on U.S. military intervention in Libya,Louis Jacobson, Newt Gingrich accused of flip-flopping on Libyan no-fly zone, PolitiFact (March 24, 2011). for which he was criticized by some commentators. On February 24, Gingrich told Fox News' Greta Van Susteren that he supported getting rid of Gaddafi but without military force. On March 7, however, Gingrich stated that President Obama should \\"exercise a no-fly zone this evening.\\"Weigel, David (March 23, 2011), \\"Newt Gingrich Completely Changes Position on Libya in 16 Days\\", Slate On March 23, Gingrich said: \\"I would not have intervened. I think there were a lot of other ways to affect Gaddafi.\\" In a subsequent statement on Facebook the same day, Gingrich attempted to clarify his remarks,Linkins, Jason (March 24, 2011) \\"Newt Gingrich Attempts To Clarify His Position On Libya But, Wow, So Confusing!\\", The Huffington Post stating that when President Obama publicly declared \\"it's time for Gaddafi to go\\" on March 3, he \\"put the prestige and authority of the United States\\" on the line and anything short of regime change would have been seen as a defeat for the United States. According to Gingrich, \\"the President should have moved immediately to consult with Congress to implement a no-fly zone\\" but instead \\"wasted weeks trying to get approval from the United Nations instead of Congress\\" resulting in a change of mission from ousting Gaddafi to one of humanitarian intervention. Promoting democracy In early 2011, Gingrich called for the promotion of democracy around the world, saying that the US should be encouraging countries to renounce dictatorial forms of government. Gingrich has stated he believes that the U.S. should push the message that \\"America stands for freedom\\". Gingrich specifically mentioned Egypt, Russia, China, and Cuba as places the United States should be applying pressure. As part of the promotion of democracy, Gingrich has said that he wants to re-think the current model of foreign aid. He says the focus of reform should be on shifting funding and responsibility away from governments and into NGOs. Gingrich has previously argued that government-to-government foreign aid programs are detrimental to the promotion of democracy since they \\"prop up\\" repressive governments and allow them to retain control. Use of torture Gingrich's position on the use of torture has changed over time.Angie Drobnic Holan, Gingrich has moderated tone on torture, PolitiFact (April 28, 2009). In 1997, while speaker of the House speaker, Gingrich raised the issue in a meeting with then-Chinese President Jiang Zemin, saying that \\"Republican leaders made explicitly clear our unwavering commitment to human rights and individual liberty\\" and that \\"There is no place for torture and arbitrary detention.\\" In a January 2009 interview, Gingrich stated: \\"I am totally opposed to the United States using any form of torture to obtain information as a matter of public policy. Under extraordinary circumstances, the government has a duty to do what it takes to protect Americans, but such cases must be personally authorized by the president.\\" In an April 2009 television appearance, when asked whether waterboarding was torture, Gingrich said that the question was \\"debatable\\" and that \\"I honestly don't know\\" the answer. Gingrich stated that however the practice was characterized, waterboarding was \\"something we shouldn't do\\" but then stated that there are \\"very rare circumstances where extreme measures\\" should be used. In a May 2009 interview, Gingrich said that \\"waterboarding is not torture\\" and defended the use of \\"specific enhanced interrogation techniques in specific circumstances against very high-level terrorists.\\" In a November 2011 Republican primary debate, Gingrich expressed support for \\"enhanced interrogation techniques\\" (a euphemism for torture).Conor Friedersdorf, Two 'Rule of Law' Republicans Dissent on Torture and Assassinations, The Atlantic (November 13, 2011). At a December 2011 campaign event, Gingrich took the position that waterboarding was technically not torture but that it should be used only at the direction of the president and in extraordinary circumstances.Ben Armbruster, Gingrich Changes His Position: 'Waterboarding Is, By Every Technical Rule, Not Torture', ThinkProgress (November 29, 2011). United Nations Gingrich supports the ideals of the United Nations Charter, but believes that the organization itself is deeply corrupt and in need of reform. Gingrich served as co-chair with former senator George Mitchell on the United States Institute of Peace's Task Force on the United Nations, which issued a report calling for the abolition of the current UN Human Rights Commission and replacement with a new Human Rights Council Gingrich sees the main problem at the United Nations being that a large group of developing countries, often referred to as the Group of 77, exploit the \\"one-country, one-vote\\" system in attempts to transfer wealth from the world's rich nations to themselves. Gingrich also points to fraud and embezzlement within the UN such as the Oil-for-Food scandal, anti-Western and anti-Israel bias within its human-rights organs, sexual assaults committed by peacekeepers, and a lack of sincere commitment to human rights as major problems that call for reform. Gingrich believes that the United States should spearhead an effort to reform the United Nations. Specifically, he calls for creating an independent oversight body, similar to corporate audit committees, to oversee financial matters, developing a clear-cut definition of terrorism emphasizing that violence against civilians is not acceptable, enhanced sanctions against human-rights violators, and a human rights body with rigorous standards for membership. Ukraine In September 2016 Gingrich stated in an interview to Europeiska Pravda that if Donald Trump won the 2016 US presidential election he would likely lift the ban on supplies of lethal weapons to Ukraine and called the ban \\"a defeat for the United States.\\"Potential U.S. Secretary of State confident in arming Ukraine – media, UNIAN (10 November 2016) (At the time Ukraine was embroiled in the War in Donbass.Warlord Arsen 'Motorola' Pavlov killed in Ukraine lift bombing, Sky News (17 October 2016)) Criticism of Obama administration Gingrich has been a longtime critic of Barack Obama, whom he described as \\"the most radical president in American history\\". Gingrich has argued that it is necessary to \\"save America\\" and stop Obama's \\"secular socialist machine\\". He has characterized the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as leading America towards authoritarianism, totalitarianism, and the end of democracy. Gingrich was criticized in 2010 by Andy Card, George W. Bush's White House chief of staff, for remarks he made during an interview with National Review, in which he said \\"What if [Obama] is so outside our comprehension, that only if you understand Kenyan, anti-colonial behavior, can you begin to piece together [his actions]? ... That is the most accurate, predictive model for his behavior.\\" Card referred to Gingrich's comments as \\"not helpful\\" to Republicans trying to win in the 2010 elections. In his book To Save America: Stopping Obama's Secular-Socialist Machine, Gingrich said, \\"The secular socialist machine represents as great a threat to America as Nazi Germany or the Soviet Union once did.\\" Role in post-Obama politics After having consulted for Donald Trump's 2016 Presidential campaign, Gingrich encouraged his fellow Republicans to give the candidate their full support. Although one of the most prominent choices considered to run as Vice President, that ultimately didn't pan out. Speculation envisaged Gingrich as a possible future Secretary of State or otherwise holding some kind of high-visibility position, with the President-elect encouraging Gingrich to evaluate different options. However, Gingrich soon announced that he wouldn't be in the new cabinet. He stated that he didn't feel particularly interested in serving in any role related to the Trump administration. He stressed that as a private citizen he could do as he did during the George W. Bush administration's tenure, engaging with individuals for \\"strategic planning\\" rather than job-seeking.

She studied at the Leningrad Choreographic School (now Vaganova Academy) in the class of Agrippina Vaganova. Upon graduation she joined the Kirov Ballet (now the Mariinsky Ballet) in 1950, and was promoted to prima ballerina in 1954. Her repertoire included: Lilac Fairy in The Sleeping Beauty, Odette-Odile in Swan Lake, Gamzatti in La Bayadère, Waltz and Mazurka in Chopiniana, Masha in The Nutcracker, Frigia in Spartak, the Mistress of the Copper Mountain in The Stone Flower (1957), and Mekhmene-Banu in Legend of Love (1961). In 1961, while Osipenko was on tour with the Kirov Ballet in Paris, one of her main dance partners, Rudolf Nureyev defected to the west on her 29th birthday. Osipenko, who was not a Communist Party member, was under considerable suspicion by the KGB upon her return to the Soviet Union who believed she might have known about the defection ahead of time (she didn't). She had a rocky relationship with the Kirov for much of the 1960s and Osipenko left the Kirov in 1971. From 1971 to 1973 she was a soloist of the troupe “Choreographic Miniatures” under direction of Leonid Jakobson. She also danced leading parts of classic and modern repertoire in stagings of well- known soviet ballet-masters. Osipenko then danced the work Leningrad choreographer, Boris Eifman, becoming the first star dancer to champion his work. Osipenko was married to fellow Kirov soloist John Markovsky who had also left the Kirov to work with Jakobson. After the fall of the Soviet Union, Osipenko moved to the US in the 1990s and worked with the Hartford Ballet Company in Connecticut. She eventually returned to St. Petersburg, Russia in 2000. She also has a longtime artistic relationship with the famed Russian filmmaker Aleksandr Sokurov and has appeared in a number of his films including the award-winning international success, Russian Ark.

The estate had belonged to the Heron family from since 1789, and the 17th-century hall was extensively rebuilt in the early 19th century by Sir Robert. He had initially used it as a summer retreat, but after being elected to Parliament he decided to make Stubton his main home. The architect Jeffry Wyatt drew up plans for remodelling, which had to be revised after the building was found to be in a poorer condition than was thought, and the resulting works were a big drain on Heron's finances: in January 1814 he recorded in his diary that he had spent £7,000 just get the building \\"covered in\\". He also kept a large menagerie, and successfully bred a range of exotic animals including llamas, alpacas. lemurs, porcupines, armadillos and kangaroos. Sir Robert and his wife Amelia, daughter and coheir of Sir Horace Mann, 2nd Baronet; had no children, and thus the baronetcy became extinct on his death. The estate passed to George Nevile, a relation of Amelia, and then to Sir Ralph Wilmot, 6th Baronet, on whose death it was sold to Edmund Royds. Stubton Hall has been restored and is now available as a venue for weddings, corporate functions, etc.https://www.stubtonhall.co.uk/  References   External links  1765 births 1854 deaths People from Newark-on-Trent Whig (British political party) MPs Alumni of St John's College, Cambridge UK MPs 1812–1818 UK MPs 1818–1820 UK MPs 1820–1826 UK MPs 1826–1830 UK MPs 1830–1831 UK MPs 1831–1832 UK MPs 1832–1835 UK MPs 1835–1837 UK MPs 1837–1841 UK MPs 1841–1847 Politics of Peterborough Baronets in the Baronetage of Great Britain High Sheriffs of Lincolnshire Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for Great Grimsby ","title":"Sir Robert Heron, 2nd Baronet"},{"id":"30092550","text":"Location of Trinity Peninsula.

This park is dedicated to the use and enjoyment of the people of East London for ever.\\" The Park proved to be a huge asset to the community from its very first day. In his first-hand account of the opening in 1922, George Jones writes: > “The ‘New Park’ proved to be an absolute bonus to the whole community and > its planning was of the highest order, using the contours of levels and > slopes down from The Highway to that new excellent promenade by the > riverside amply provided with many bench seats and popular with senior > citizens. Seen from the upper levels the huge vista of the then very busy > Thames was an ever-changing kaleidoscope of colour and activity, of wharves > and cranes and ships from all nations.” The opening of the park , Save KEMP The site of the park itself is steeped in history. In May 1533, Sir Hugh Willoughby set off from what is now the park with three ships in search for the Northeast Passage to India.Knowledge Of London Nowadays a stone and plaque placed near the listed Rotherhithe Rotunda commemorate Willoughby’s courageous enterprise. The Shadwell Fish Market was opened in 1885 in the area where the park is now. It didn’t do very well however and the land became used for informal football matches and a play area by local children. A report in The East London Observer on 23 December 1911, gives a report of a planning committee meeting about the setting up of the King Edward Memorial Park. Proposals and sketches of the plans appeared the next year. King George and Queen Mary both attended the official opening on 24 June 1922. In the printed order of proceedings for the opening it stated that the Queen would give a speech. ‘Her Majesty will … declare the park open to the public for ever.’ The park is famous for its unrestricted views of the river, for its amenitiesGreen Flag Awards and its biodiversity value Trees for Cities that has won it the Green Flag Award several times. Placed at the crossroads of four Tower Hamlets wards (Shadwell, Wapping, Limehouse and Stepney), King Edward VII Memorial Park is the only riverside park between Tower Hill and the Isle of Dogs and the only green space available in this portion of the Borough. Local schools use it for their sports days, religious festivals take place there and it is overall the focal point of the lives of four vibrant communities. The importance of King Edward VII Memorial Park to local people is shown by the number of nearby residents with memorials there. The park benches on the riverfront are always adorned with flowers in remembrance of beloved family members and also many trees have been planted in honour of local people now passed. Proposed use for Thames Tunnel works Pavilion in park Thames Water has proposed to build a new sewer relief tunnel along the Thames, to avoid discharging sewage into the river as frequently as is currently necessary. The preferred route takes it past this park, and Thames Water proposed that part of the park should be used for construction of the tunnel, leaving a permanent access road through the park from The Highway and a ventilation shaft built on an extension to the foreshore.King Edward Memorial Park Foreshore, Thames Water consultation document December 2010 Tower Hamlets Council announced official support for an option which would at least leave most of the park accessible during construction, and reinstate it at the end.Call for riverside park to stay open, Tower Hamlets Council, 13 December 2010. However, after looking at Thames Water's plans in more detail, it has emerged that the preferred option could make the park unusable for several years. The community has come together and created an action group that opposes the plans for the park and asks Thames Water to build on a brownfield site instead. In response to the campaign, many councillors and Cabinet Members have spoken against this project and Mayor Lutfur Rahman himself is a supporter of the SaveKEMP campaign.Keep King Edward VII Memorial Park (KEMP) Green February 2011 On 2 February 2011 a motion to oppose Thames Water's plans and protect King Edward VII Memorial Park and its foreshore was passed with unanimous vote by the full Chamber of LBTH effectively overturning the position taken in December. The plan is also being officially opposed by Jim Fitzpatrick, Labour MP for Poplar and Limehouse who said, \\"I have been impressed by the energy and vigour of local people, for whom King Edward VII Memorial Park is an important part of their lives. The current proposal will turn one of London's vital green lungs into an industrial site and leave a permanent scar on the banks of the river. Thames Water needs to listen, to do its homework more thoroughly, and to come back with alternatives. Yes to reducing water pollution; yes to keeping King Edward VII Memorial Park green.\\" John Biggs, Labour politician and elected member of the London Assembly for City and East London has spoken strongly against Thames Water's plans: > \\"I support the call by residents of Limehouse, Shadwell, Stepney and Wapping > for Thames Water to review its preferred options for the Super Sewer and to > focus specifically on brownfield sites for this development. I speak as > someone who both endorses the Super Sewer and who knows the Park very well. > It is clear to me that the current plans to build on the foreshore of the > Park will damage an important local amenity which is more widely used than > Thames Water has appreciated. Additionally, the park has an important role > as a part of our heritage in the East End, and it needs to be treated with > sensitivity. Despite the limitations of the current consultation, local > people have seized the initiative to make their voices heard. Thames Water > has said that it will use information gathered during the current > consultation \\"to address any concerns which may arise\\". Local concerns are > very clear. Thames Water should look again at options for brownfield > development, beyond the options currently identified, so that reducing water > pollution does not mean that a vital green space is irreparably damaged and > for several years turned into a major construction site.\\" A large number of residents raised an online petition against the plan and have organised a protest group, as the riverside path would be closed to the public for up to seven years and the community would lose the only riverside park between Tower Hill and the Isle of Dogs. November 2011 Thames Water issued a modified proposal. The route of the access road has been changed to run next to the Thames Path from Glamis Road. This would reduce the impact on the park during construction, and also mean that, on completion, the access road would merge with Thames Path, slightly extending the park and making a wider section of the Thames Path.King Edward Memorial Park Foreshore – phase two site information paper  September 2014  Thames Water finally received permission to use the park for sewer works, but agreed a £4 million programme of improvements, to be completed before starting the sewer construction. The improvements will include new sports and play facilities, a community building and extending the park onto the foreshore. Moreover, construction works will not normally take place on Saturdays, to reduce the impact on weekend use of the park.  July 2020  The Tideway construction project is ongoing.

The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987. Description and history The Elias Sprague House is located in a rural setting in southwestern Coventry, on the south side of South Street a short way east of Nathan Hale State Forest. It is a 1-1/2 story wood frame Cape style house, with a gabled roof, central chimney, and clapboarded exterior. Its main facade is five bays wide, with a center entrance. The interior follows a typical central chimney plan, with a narrow entrance vestibule, parlors on either side of the chimney, and the kitchen behind it. Original period features include wooden paneling and trim, and several doors with original strap hinges. The house was built in 1821, and is a well-preserved example of vernacular country architecture of the period. It was owned during the early 20th century by George Dudley Seymour, a noted antiquarian. The house was later acquired from the town by the Coventry Historical Society, which restored the house in 1964-1965 and operated it as a historic house site. and In 2008, the historical society placed the house on the market, having outgrown its use as a meeting space, a move that elicited some controversy. The town had given it the property with the proviso that it operate it as a museum, and arguments were made that the historical society was therefore not permitted to sell it. The State Property Review Board unanimously approved the sale of the property for residential use in 2011. The restored and expanded property is now privately owned.

During months when there was no work on the farm, he would travel to other towns selling garlic.Biography in Spanish. Accessed 2010-12-15. Career In the summer of 1928, he went to a novillada, a bullfight of young bulls. During the fight, a bull injured the sole bullfighter present. Sensing an opportunity, Ortega jumped into the ring, asked for the bullfighter's tools, gave several passes, and killed the bull. The incident proved to be the start of a new career for him. In 1931, he had only performed in six novilladas when he received the alternativa—graduation from novillero to full matador de toros—from Gitanillo de Triana in Barcelona. The same year, his alternativa was confirmed by Nicanor Villalta in Madrid. He subsequently performed in many bullfights before retiring in 1950. He briefly came out of retirement for a period in 1953.El País, article 1985-12-23 Accessed 2010-12-15. He is quoted as saying that the three canonical maxims of bullfighting, parar, templar y mandar (\\"to stop, to moderate, to command\\"), should be supplemented with a fourth: \\"to load,\\" meaning the bullfighter should put his weight on his forward foot to put him closer to the bull. He said that a bullfighter being caught by the bull was always due to a mistake on the part of the bullfighter: \\"In bullfighting either the bullfighter or the bull is in command.\\" Legacy While most modern sources praise Ortega highly, Ernest Hemingway expressed a low opinion of him in Death in the Afternoon, describing him as \\"skillfully built up... with an elaborate press campaign and ballyhoo,\\" and stating, \\"He was lousy\\".Death in the Afternoon, Chapter 14 However Laura Riding refuted Hemingway's view strongly in her essay 'The Bull-Fight', calling Ortega \\"the critical modernist among contemporary bull-fighters\\" and saying \\"There are few books that have given me such a sense of learned simplicity as Ortega's work\\".Laura Riding, \\"The BullFight\\", Epilogue II (1936).
