Biography Berbig was an antiques dealer in West Berlin in 1978 when an elderly woman entered his store wanting to sell heirlooms. The woman was Romanian princess Catherine Caradja (also known as Princess Caradja-Kretzulesco), who claimed to be a blood relative of Vlad Dracula. The two became friends, and the princess was keen to adopt Berbig as her family had no male heirs to carry the family name.Dracula's Kingdom! Once formally adopted, the newly renamed 'Prince Kretzulesco' proved adroit at exploiting his 'Dracula lineage'. From his 46-room palace located in the town of Schenkendorf (Brandenburg), he organized so-called \\"blood-sucking parties\\" in conjunction with the German Red Cross at which guests were invited to donate blood. Likewise he entertained numerous other charity events including medieval festivals and ghost story-telling evenings.Count Dracula Dies in Germany He also set up a wine business, marketing under the Castle of Dracula label, and became a local councillor, at one time proclaiming the town of Schenkendorf 'Dracula's Principality'.

It depicts an unidentified girl seated in profile, wearing a lemon yellow dress with white ruff collar and cuffs and purple ribbons, and reading from a small book held in her right hand. The painting is in the National Gallery of Art in Washington, DC.  History  Jean-Honor√© Fragonard had an extensive career. After he won the 1753 Prix de Rome with a painting titled Jeroboam Sacrificing to the Golden Calf, he became one of the foremost French painters in the Rococo style, which was filled with light colors, asymmetrical designs, and curved, natural forms. The Rococo style emerged in Paris during the eighteenth century, more specifically during the reign of Louis XV, when the French upper class experienced a new social and intellectual freedom. As Petra ten- Doesschate Chu stated, \\"Aristocrats and wealthy bourgeois focused on play and pleasure. Grace and wit were prized in social interactions. A new intellectual curiosity gave rise to a healthy skepticism toward well-worn truths.\\" Fragonard was most drawn to the playful lives and loves of the aristocratic youth of his day. The painting was purchased by the National Gallery of Art in Washington, DC in 1961 using funds donated by Ailsa Mellon Bruce, the daughter of Andrew W. Mellon, following her father's death. Ailsa Mellon Bruce was a well-known socialite in Manhattan and gained recognition in the art world from the numerous generous donations she gave to a variety of museums and art programs. Painting The painting features an unidentified girl wearing a lemon yellow dress with white ruff collar and cuffs and purple ribbons. The subject is depicted in profile, reading from a small book held in her right hand, sitting with her left arm on a wooden rail and her back supported by a large lilac cushion resting against a wall. Her hair is tied in a chignon with a purple ribbon, and her face and dress are lit from the front, casting a shadow in the wall behind her. Fragonard pays close attention to the face, but uses looser brushwork on the dress and cushion, and the ruff was scratched into the paint with the end of a brush. The horizontal line of the armrest and a vertical line between two unadorned walls provide a sense of space and structure. The text of the book is not legible and no hint is given of the content. In Young Girl Reading, color helps convey emotion and mood. Fragonard used a typical Rococo color scheme, which consisted of soft, delicate colors and hues of gold. The pillow's violet tint, the darker-toned walls and armrest, and the female subject's rosy-toned skin and bright-yellow dress help create the illusion of warmth and joy, and a sense of sensuality. These bright colors present a strong contrast to the dark background and help the viewer home in on the curves and contours of the female form. Texture is created through Fragonard's loose, but energetic and gestural brushstrokes, as in the frills in the girl's dress. Texture helps create depth and contrast among different elements of the painting‚Äîfor example, the walls, the dress, and armrest all have different textures created through different styles of brushstrokes. The work is more a genre painting of an everyday scene than a portrait, and the name of the sitter is not known. X-ray photography has revealed that the canvas originally featured a different head looking towards the viewer, which Fragonard painted over. It is one in a series of quickly executed paintings by Fragonard featuring young girls, known as figures de fantaisie. The painting was not a completed academic work, and probably passed through the hands of several collectors and dealers in France. It was owned by surgeon Th√©odore Tuffier, and came to the US before 1930, when it was in the collection of Alfred W. Erickson in New York, founder of the advertising agency McCann Erickson. It was inherited by his wife Anna Edith McCann Erickson in 1936, and following her death in 1961 it was bought by the National Gallery of Art.

It is central to programming languages derived from lambda calculus, such as LISP and Scheme, and also in functional languages. It has a role in the study of the denotational semantics of computer programs, because it is a continuous function on complete partial orders. Apply is also a continuous function in homotopy theory, and, indeed underpins the entire theory: it allows a homotopy deformation to be viewed as a continuous path in the space of functions. Likewise, valid mutations (refactorings) of computer programs can be seen as those that are \\"continuous\\" in the Scott topology. The most general setting for apply is in category theory, where it is right adjoint to currying in closed monoidal categories. A special case of this are the Cartesian closed categories, whose internal language is simply typed lambda calculus. Programming In computer programming, apply applies a function to a list of arguments. Eval and apply are the two interdependent components of the eval-apply cycle, which is the essence of evaluating Lisp, described in SICP.Harold Abelson, Gerald Jay Sussman, Julie Sussman, Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, (1996) MIT Press, . See Section 4.1, The Metacircular Evaluator Function application corresponds to beta reduction in lambda calculus. Apply function Apply is also the name of a special function in many languages, which takes a function and a list, and uses the list as the function's own argument list, as if the function were called with the elements of the list as the arguments. This is important in languages with variadic functions, because this is the only way to call a function with an indeterminate (at compile time) number of arguments. =Common Lisp and Scheme= In Common Lisp apply is a function that applies a function to a list of arguments (note here that \\"+\\" is a variadic function that takes any number of arguments): (apply #'+ (list 1 2)) Similarly in Scheme: (apply + (list 1 2)) =C++= In C++, Bind http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_49_0/libs/bind/bind.html#with_functions is used either via the std namespace or via the boost namespace. =C# and Java= In C# and Java, variadic arguments are simply collected in an array. Caller can explicitly pass in an array in place of the variadic arguments. This can only be done for a variadic parameter. It is not possible to apply an array of arguments to non-variadic parameter without using reflection. An ambiguous case arises should the caller want to pass an array itself as one of the arguments rather than using the array as a list of arguments. In this case, the caller should cast the array to \`Object\` to prevent the compiler from using the apply interpretation. variadicFunc(arrayOfArgs);With version 8 lambda expressions were introduced. Functions are implemented as objects with a functional interface, an interface with only one non-static method. The standard interface Function consist of the method (plus some static utility functions): R apply(T para) =Go= In Go, typed variadic arguments are simply collected in a slice. The caller can explicitly pass in a slice in place of the variadic arguments, by appending a \`...\` to the slice argument. This can only be done for a variadic parameter. The caller can not apply an array of arguments to non-variadic parameters, without using reflection.. s := []string{\\"foo\\", \\"bar\\"} variadicFunc(s...) =Haskell= In Haskell, functions may be applied by simple juxtaposition: func param1 param2 ... In Haskell, the syntax may also be interpreted that each parameter curries its function in turn. In the above example, \\"func param1\\" returns another function accepting one fewer parameters, that is then applied to param2, and so on, until the function has no more parameters. =JavaScript= In JavaScript, function objects have an \`apply\` method, the first argument is the value of the \`this\` keyword inside the function; the second is the list of arguments: func.apply(null, args); ES6 adds the spread operator \`func(...args)\` which may be used instead of \`apply\`. =Lua= In Lua, apply can be written this way: function apply(f,...) return f(...) end =Perl= In Perl, arrays, hashes and expressions are automatically \\"flattened\\" into a single list when evaluated in a list context, such as in the argument list of a function # Equivalent subroutine calls: @args = (@some_args, @more_args); func(@args); func(@some_args, @more_args); =PHP= In PHP, \`apply\` is called \`call_user_func_array\`: call_user_func_array('func_name', $args); =Python and Ruby= In Python and Ruby, the same asterisk notation used in defining variadic functions is used for calling a function on a sequence and array respectively: func(*args) Python originally had an apply function, but this was deprecated in favour of the asterisk in 2.3 and removed in 3.0. =R= In R, \`do.call\` constructs and executes a function call from a name or a function and a list of arguments to be passed to it: f(x1, x2) # can also be performed via do.call(what = f, args = list(x1, x2)) =Smalltalk= In Smalltalk, block (function) objects have a \`valueWithArguments:\` method which takes an array of arguments: aBlock valueWithArguments: args =Tcl= Since Tcl 8.5, a function can be applied to arguments with the \`apply\` command apply func ?arg1 arg2 ...? where the function is a two element list {args body} or a three element list {args body namespace}. Universal property Consider a function g:(X\\\\times Y)\\\\to Z, that is, g\\\\isin [(X\\\\times Y)\\\\to Z] where the bracket notation [A\\\\to B] denotes the space of functions from A to B. By means of currying, there is a unique function \\\\mbox{curry}(g) :X\\\\to [Y\\\\to Z] . Then Apply provides the universal morphism :\\\\mbox{Apply}:([Y\\\\to Z]\\\\times Y) \\\\to Z, so that :\\\\mbox {Apply}(f,y)=f(y) or, equivalently one has the commuting diagram :\\\\mbox{Apply} \\\\circ \\\\left( \\\\mbox{curry}(g) \\\\times \\\\mbox{id}_Y \\\\right) = g More precisely, curry and apply are adjoint functors. The notation [A\\\\to B] for the space of functions from A to B occurs more commonly in computer science. In category theory, however, [A\\\\to B] is known as the exponential object, and is written as B^A. There are other common notational differences as well; for example Apply is often called Eval,Saunders Mac Lane, Category Theory even though in computer science, these are not the same thing, with eval distinguished from Apply, as being the evaluation of the quoted string form of a function with its arguments, rather than the application of a function to some arguments. Also, in category theory, curry is commonly denoted by \\\\lambda, so that \\\\lambda g is written for curry(g). This notation is in conflict with the use of \\\\lambda in lambda calculus, where lambda is used to denote bound variables. With all of these notational changes accounted for, the adjointness of Apply and curry is then expressed in the commuting diagram Universal property of the exponential object The articles on exponential object and Cartesian closed category provide a more precise discussion of the category-theoretic formulation of this idea. Thus use of lambda here is not accidental; the internal language of Cartesian closed categories is simply- typed lambda calculus. The most general possible setting for Apply are the closed monoidal categories, of which the cartesian closed categories are an example. In homological algebra, the adjointness of curry and apply is known as tensor-hom adjunction. Topological properties In order theory, in the category of complete partial orders endowed with the Scott topology, both curry and apply are continuous functions (that is, they are Scott continuous).H.P. Barendregt, The Lambda Calculus, (1984) North-Holland This property helps establish the foundational validity of the study of the denotational semantics of computer programs. In algebraic geometry and homotopy theory, curry and apply are both continuous functions when the space Y^X of continuous functions from X to Y is given the compact open topology, and X is locally compact Hausdorff. This result is very important, in that it underpins homotopy theory, allowing homotopic deformations to be understood as continuous paths in the space of functions.

The picture is based on the play Ah, Wilderness! (1933) by Eugene O'Neill, which had been filmed under that name by MGM in 1935 with Rooney in a much smaller role, as the younger brother. Though completed in October 1946, this film sat on the shelf until 1948.http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/1950/Summer-Holiday/notes.html In addition to Walter Huston, the supporting cast features Frank Morgan as the drunken Uncle Sid, (a role originated in the stage play by Gene Lockhart, portrayed onscreen by Wallace Beery in 1935 and later by Jackie Gleason on Broadway) as well as Marilyn Maxwell, Agnes Moorehead, Selena Royle and Anne Francis. One of producer Arthur Freed‚Äôs MGM musicals, it has beautiful costumes and cinematography that take full advantage of Technicolor. Plot Director Rouben Mamoulian saw this project as an opportunity to create a very different kind of ‚Äúmusical play‚Äù and he gave songwriters Ralph Blane (lyrics) and Harry Warren (music) specific instructions on what he wanted to do. The result can be seen in the opening sequence, ‚ÄúOur Home Town,‚Äù begun by Nat Miller (Walter Huston) who introduces us to the town and to the family. The sequence segues back and forth and back again into lines that are sung, lines that are spoken in rhyme, and lines that are read straight, and ends in the soda fountain. The length of this sequence may be the root of the incorrect idea that the whole film is written in rhyme. The movie takes place in Danville, Connecticut, starting in June 1906. It centers around 17-year-old Richard Miller (Mickey Rooney) who is about to graduate from high school, go to Yale, and step into the world of adults. He has a cynical view of the world because of all the books he has been reading. He has a girlfriend, Muriel McComber (Gloria DeHaven) whom he loves very much (she lives across the street) but she is afraid of being kissed. He tries to convince her as they sing ‚ÄúAfraid to Fall in Love.‚Äù He doesn't get the kiss but they do dance across the park. Richard's father, Nat Miller (Walter Huston) editor of the town newspaper, is a wise man with a sense of humor that serves him well in facing the challenges of parenthood. Richard has three other siblings: older brother Arthur (Michael Kirby) who is home on vacation from Yale; sister, Mildred (Shirley Johns), and mischievous Tommy, (Butch Jenkins), the youngest. Also living with the family are his Uncle Sid (Frank Morgan) and Cousin Lily (Agnes Moorehead). They are usually on the verge of getting engaged, but the uncle's drinking gets in the way. Uncle Sid is leaving for a new job in Waterbury, in hopes of making good (he is nearly 50). The graduating class enters the auditorium marching to the Danville High fight song and smoothly transitions to an elegiac Alma Mater, and the camera pans over touching vignettes of listening townspeople, including a deliberate recreation of Grant Wood‚Äôs ‚ÄúAmerican Gothic‚Äù. Richard, who is valedictorian, plans to give a Marxist call to arms, but he leaves his speech where his father can see it and, during a round of applause, Nat stops him before he can get to the revolutionary material. After the ceremony, his father asks him if his conscience will allow him to drive the family‚Äôs Stanley Steamer. A bright number built around the song ‚ÄúStanley Steamer‚Äù follows. Dawn on a peaceful morning; the town is hung with flags for the 4th of July. Suddenly explosions erupt all over town as boys and girls (and a young-at-heart grandfather) set off masses fireworks. Richard, still spouting revolutionary propaganda and scorning the 4th, is surprised to find that his father has not only read Carlyle's ‚ÄúFrench Revolution,‚Äù but admires it‚Äîas he does the Rub√°iy√°t of Omar Khayyam. Mother Essie (Selena Royle), on the other hand, is horrified at Richard's choice of reading, which also includes Swinburne and Oscar Wilde's The Ballad of Reading Gaol, and says that this ‚Äúis no kind of reading for a young boy.‚Äù Uncle Sid appears, and Nat quickly realizes that he has been fired. To save him the embarrassment, he offers Sid his old job. At the bandstand, a cornet player displays his skill, setting off the ‚ÄúIndependence Day‚Äù number. A tableau recreating The Spirit of ‚Äò76 takes a bow. Everyone celebrates at separate picnics; each area has its own routine to go with ‚ÄúIndependence Day.‚Äù At the men's picnic, they have a beer-drinking contest, which Sid wins. At the women's picnic, they play croquet and share the delicacies they have cooked. The kids swim at the pond and the young people sing and dance. No sooner has the Miller family returned home for dinner than Muriel's father arrives, accusing Richard of corrupting Muriel's morals. He saw Richard trying to kiss her. That was bad enough, but the letters Richard wrote to her are worse. When Nat Miller takes the whole things with a sense of humor, Macomber threatens him with loss of his advertising and storms out, leaving a farewell letter from Muriel to Richard, dictated by him. When Richard reads it, he is heartbroken, devastated and angry; he bursts into tears. At the dinner table, a tipsy Sid has everyone laughing, but Lily weeps, saying that they all encourage him and laugh at him‚Äîand maybe they shouldn't. Richard launches into a diatribe about women driving men to drink and marches out of the house. At the front gate, his older brother's friend Wint (Hal Hackett) invites him on a double date with some ‚Äúslick babies from New Haven.‚Äù They turn out to be a couple of dance hall girls. Wint and Crystal (Ruth Brady) leave immediately. Richard's girl, Belle (Marilyn Maxwell), takes him to a bar to drink, although he is underage. Like the opening, this is a long scene mixing spoken and sung dialogue. It has a nightmarish quality that is enhanced by the way Belle's costume changes, from pastel pink to scarlet and back, and the bright green wash of light over the background. The bartender slips something into Richard's drink. He gets drunk but it has the opposite effect to what Belle expected. He starts trying to reform her. Belle gets fed up with him and goes to sit with another guy. When that man points out that Richard is underage, the bartender throws him out. When Belle tells him that the boy is the son of a newspaper owner and could run him out of town, he throws Belle out. Richard arrives home drunk and miserable. The next day, Belle writes to Nat, reporting the bartender for serving alcohol to an underage boy. Meanwhile, Muriel finally finds a way to send a note of apology to Richard, through Tommy, saying she will always love him. They meet at night at the brook and finally kiss. ‚ÄúWon‚Äôt it be wonderful when we‚Äôre married!‚Äù Richard exclaims He returns home in state of exaltation. His father says that it's about time that they had a serious talk about‚Äî‚Äúcertain women.‚Äù Nat works himself into a state, hemming and hawing and mangling Richard's clay sculpture of Lincoln‚Äîand never completing a sentence. Finally, Richard, full of concern, gives his father a drink of water and tells him not to worry, he is going to marry Muriel. (The scene was written this way to get around the censor, who refused to approve any language that came near the subject of sex.) Sid and Lili are in the swing, drinking lemonade. Mildred and Art are out walking with their sweethearts. Mr. Macomber and Nat have been reconciled, off camera. Richard's outlook on the future is now brighter and happier. ‚ÄúWe are completely surrounded by love.‚Äù Nat says. Richard kisses his parents and goes out to look at the moon, waving goodnight to Muriel, who is standing in her bedroom window. Nat, surveying the scene, quotes the Rubaiyat and says to his wife, ‚ÄúSpring isn‚Äôt everything.‚Äù The end.

He combined his duties as president with playing, having played total of ten matches for the club including the very first one. His main achievement for the club was getting its first home ground at Hotel Casanovas. After his resignation, Wild was awarded honorary president in recognition of his contribution to the club, but having moved to London (which prompted the widespread mistake of attributing British nationality to him), he showed little further interest in the club until 1949, when he returned as an Honorary Guest on FC Barcelona's 50th Anniversary.

Intended for service abroad, they exchanged heavy armour and a powerful armament for high speed and long range to counter the foreign armoured cruisers then being built as commerce raiders and were rated as second-class battleships. Completed in 1894, Centurion was assigned to the China Station as its flagship. Together with her sister ship, , she supported Allied operations during the Boxer Rebellion of 1899‚Äì1901 and contributed landing parties to participate in the Battles of the Taku Forts and of Tientsin. The ship returned home in 1901 to be rebuilt with a more powerful secondary armament. Centurion rejoined the China Station two years later and remained there until 1905 when she returned to Britain. Already made obsolete by the increasing speeds of the cruisers the ship was designed to defend against, she was placed in reserve until 1909. Centurion was decommissioned that year and sold for scrap in 1910. Design and description The Centurion class was designed to meet an Admiralty requirement for ships suitable for use as flagships on the China and Pacific Stations, able to defeat the most powerful foreign ships likely to be encountered there.Burt, pp. 109‚Äì10 They had an overall length of and a length between perpendiculars of , and a beam of .

The Centurions were powered by a pair of three-cylinder vertical triple-expansion steam engines, each driving a single propeller, using steam provided by eight coal-fired cylindrical boilers. The engines were designed to produce a total of which was intended to allow the ships to make a speed of using natural draught.

Their secondary armament consisted of ten 40-calibre quick-firing (QF) 4.7-inch guns in single mounts. Half a dozen of these guns were mounted on the upper deck, protected by gun shields, and the remaining guns were mounted in casemates in the sides of the hull. Defence against torpedo boats was provided by eight QF six-pounder () guns and a dozen QF three-pounder () Hotchkiss guns. The ships were also armed with seven 18-inchThe actual diameter of these torpedoes was . torpedo tubes, two on each broadside and one in the stern above water and one on each broadside underwater. The Centurion-class ships were mostly fitted with compound armour although some portions were made from improved Harvey armour. Their waterline main belt ranged in thickness from . The armoured deck lay across the top of the waterline belt and consisted of of mild steel. Below the waterline, the lower deck extended from the bases of the barbettes to the bow and stern. The barbettes were thick and the gun crews were protected by an armoured hood or gunhouse that consisted of 6 inches of nickel steel.Burt, pp. 115, 117 Modifications Bilge keels were added to Centurion in 1896‚Äì1897 and gun shields were removed from those guns mounted in the fighting tops between 1897 and 1899. Some three-pounders were removed from Centurions fighting tops about two years later. In September 1901, the ship began a reconstruction that exchanged her 4.7-inch guns with 6-inch guns and upgraded their protection. To help compensate for the additional weight, all of her above-water torpedo tubes were removed as was the aft bridge. The remaining three-pounders in the fighting tops were repositioned to the superstructure and the barbette hoods and the foremast was replaced by a signal mast.Burt, pp. 117, 119 Despite these measures there was a slight increase in weight that reduced the ship's speed by about .Parkes, p. 369 In 1906 all of her remaining three-pounders were removed and the mainmast fighting top was modified as a fire-control position.Burt, p. 119 Construction and career Centurion was named after the Roman Army rankSilverstone, p. 220 and was the sixth ship of her name to serve in the Royal Navy.Colledge, p. 63 The ship was laid down at HM Dockyard, Portsmouth on 30 March 1890 and launched on 3 August 1892.

Captain John Jellicoe (the future First Sea Lord) assumed command of the ship on 12 February 1898. A week later, Vice-Admiral Sir Edward Seymour hoisted his flag aboard her. During the Boxer Rebellion, she contributed men to Seymour's expedition that attempted and failed to relieve the besieged International Legations in Peking, capital of China, between 10 and 28 June 1900. Jellicoe served as Seymour's flag-captain during the expedition and was badly wounded on the 21st.Seymour, pp. 343, 349 In addition, the ship put landing parties ashore which joined other forces in storming the Taku forts on 16‚Äì17 June and in relieving the foreign legations at Tientsin on 13‚Äì14 July. While anchored at Woosung, China, near Shanghai, she parted her mooring cables during a storm on 17 April 1901 and drifted across the bows of the battleship HMS Glory. Glorys bow punched a hole in Centurions hull below the waterline, but the damage was not serious and was repaired at Hong Kong. Glory relieved Centurion as flagship on 10 June and Vice-Admiral Sir Cyprian Bridge relieved Seymour on the 26th.Seymour, p. 375 Centurion, with Seymour aboard, arrived at Portsmouth on 19 August, where she was welcomed by the local Commander-in-Chief and thousands of people lining the beach and pier. Admiral Seymour struck his flag on 21 August, and, after a month, Centurion paid off into reserve there on 19 September. The ship began a reconstruction at Portsmouth that month, including a partial rearmament, that lasted until on 3 November 1903 when she recommissioned for another period of service on the China Station. Centurion departed Portsmouth on 10 November and arrived at Hong Kong on 31 December 1903. In 1905, the United Kingdom and Japan renewed the Anglo-Japanese Alliance which reduced the need for a large Royal Navy presence on the China Station and all its battleships were withdrawn. Accordingly, on 7 June, Centurion, together with the battleship HMS Ocean, departed Hong Kong. At Singapore, they rendezvoused with the battleships HMS Albion and HMS Vengeance. The four battleships departed Singapore on 20 June and steamed in company to Plymouth, where they arrived on 2 August. HMS Centurion by W. Fred Mitchell, 1904 Centurion paid off at Portsmouth on 25 August. She recommissioned the following day with a nucleus crew as part of the Portsmouth Division of the Reserve Fleet because she was already obsolete. The ship participated in combined exercises of the Reserve Fleet, Atlantic Fleet, and Channel Fleet in June 1906. On 24 May 1907, Centurion transferred her crew to the battleship HMS Exmouth and recommissioned the next day with a new nucleus crew to serve as a special service vessel with the Portsmouth Division of the Home Fleet, the Reserve Fleet having been absorbed by the Home Fleet in the meantime. In March 1909, the special service vessels were reassigned to the 4th Division, Home Fleet.Burt, pp. 121, 123 This did not last long as Centurion paid off for the last time on 1 April and was listed for sale. By the end of June, she was anchored at the Motherbank, awaiting disposal. The ship was sold for scrap on 12 July 1910 for a price of ¬£26,300, and arrived at Thos W Ward, Morecambe to begin demolition on 4 September. Legacy In August 1902 an obelisk was erected in Victoria Park, Portsmouth, in memory of the officers and men of the Centurion who had lost their lives in China.

Barfleur was temporarily recommissioned on 18 July 1904 to participate in that year's annual maneuvers. During them she was slightly damaged when she accidentally collided with the battleship in Mount's Bay on 5 August 1904. After their conclusion, she was paid off again on 8 September 1904. On 21 February 1905, Barfleur recommissioned to take a new crew out to the battleship , then serving on the China Station. The two ships rendezvoused at Colombo, Ceylon, on 30 March 1905 and Vengeance‚Ä≤s old crew then steamed Barfleur back home. The ship arrived at Portsmouth on 7 May 1905 and paid off there two days later. On 10 May 1905, Barfleur recommissioned with a nucleus crew to serve as the flagship of the Rear Admiral, Portsmouth Division of the Reserve Fleet. In June 1905, she took 6 officers and 105 ratings of the London Division of the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve on a training cruise.Burt, p. 123 On 28 November 1905, she transferred her crew to the battleship and received a new nucleus crew.

The battleship relieved her on 4 March 1907 and Barfleur became the parent ship of special service vessels in the Portsmouth Division. The special service vessels were transferred to the 4th Division, Home Fleet, in March 1909 and she ceased her service as their parent ship the following month. In June 1909, Barfleur listed for sale and was towed to the Motherbank, where she was moored awaiting disposal. On 12 July 1910Gardiner & Gray, p. 6 she was sold for scrap for ¬£26,500. Barfleur had an eventful trip to the scrapyard, becoming jammed between the piers of a swing bridge at Newcastle upon Tyne while under tow up the River Tyne on 5 August 1910. This meant that the bridge could not close and blocked all road traffic until she could be freed. She resumed her trip after some of her deck fittings were cut away and was scrapped at Blyth.

The operations of Maidstone Corporation passed to Maidstone Borough Council Transport in reorganisation of local government in 1974, expanding the Borough boundaries. History Preserved tramlines pictured in 2009. Maidstone Corporation Tramways began operation on 14 July 1904 with the introduction of a service to Barming, supplemented by routes to Loose and Tovil by 1907. The Barming trams were replaced by trolleybuses in 1928, and the Loose trams replaced in 1930. The Tovil tram was replaced by buses in 1929. The Maidstone trolleybus system was expanded with development of new housing until 1963, when the decision was made to convert to buses. The last trolleybuses ran on 15 April 1967. The tramway's main depot with its offices and sheds were located on the north side of Tonbridge Road, about 50 metres east of its junction with Queens Road. These premises were subsequently used by trolleybuses. As of 2009 the site had become a residential development named the Coach Yard, but some of the original tramway tracks and cobbles have been left visible in a preserved central section of its accessway and car park. A smaller tramshed (capacity 4 trams) was located in Pickering Street, Loose, and was also later used by the trolleybuses. In 1974, under local government reorganisation and expansion of the borough boundary, Maidstone Corporation Transport became Maidstone Borough Council Transport. In the film The Lincoln Lawyer, Mickey Haller's (Matthew McConaughey) Los Angeles apartment is decorated with route signs from Maidstone Corporation Transport buses. The termini Senacre and Park Wood are clearly visible as police officers search the room. Liveries Maidstone Corporation started out with an ochre and cream colour scheme, with gold Maidstone Corporation lettering and the council crest. A Fiesta blue and cream livery was introduced for the buses that replaced the trolleybuses. Fleet Maidstone operated a fleet of Sunbeam trolleybuses. In 1959, following closure of the nearby Hastings Tramways trolleybus system owned by Maidstone & District, Maidstone Corporation acquired five of their trolleybuses. Also purchased were two vehicles from the closing Brighton system, including now- preserved 52. Maidstone operated a universally double-deck fleet of motorbuses. Vehicles showed only destinations with no route numbers.

May graduated from Parkway West High School in Ballwin, Missouri. From there, he skipped college and entered the Major League Baseball draft in 2003. He was selected by the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 8th round as the 241st overall pick. He played in Major League Baseball with the Kansas City Royals in 2010. Career Los Angeles Dodgers May began his professional career after he signed with the Dodgers. He played at the rookie level for the Gulf Coast Dodgers in 2003. He played shortstop and batted .252 with no home runs in 48 games. In 2004, May stayed at the rookie level, playing for the Ogden Raptors. Playing in only 34 games, he had a .286 batting average with 5 home runs. He was promoted to Single-A in 2005, playing for the Columbus Catfish. He played shortstop as well as beginning to play in the outfield. His bad defense had prompted the organization to make the switch as he committed 18 errors in 46 games in 2003, 18 errors in 34 games in 2004, and 26 errors in 46 games.Weisman, Jon (via commenter CanuckDodger). \\"Roster Rumblings\\", November 21, 2007. Accessed November 23, 2007. May played for the Catfish again in 2006, this time seeing all his action in the outfield. In 119 games, he had a .273 batting average and showed some power, hitting 18 home runs. In 2007, May was promoted to the next level. He played for the Advanced Single-A Inland Empire 66ers. Switching positions again, he played the whole year as a catcher and displayed power in his 128 games played. His 25 home runs were tied for second in the California League and his 89 RBIs were good enough for 10th in the league. His slugging percentage was little more than 200 points higher than his batting average and his strikeout totals went down from 130 to 107 from the previous year. He was named to the California League All-Star team and went 1 for 4 with two runs scored in the All-Star game. Following the season on November 20, 2007, May's contract was purchased by the Los Angeles Dodgers, protecting him from the Rule 5 Draft. The Dodgers assigned May to the Double-A Jacksonville Suns for the 2008 season where he hit .230 with 13 home runs in 392 at bats. In 2009, May played for the Dodgers' new Double-A affiliate, the Chattanooga Lookouts. He was named to the Southern League mid-season All-Star team and after the season played for Team USA in the 2009 Baseball World Cup where he hit 3 home runs, playing in all games as a starting catcher. After starting 2010 with Chattanooga, he was shortly promoted to the Triple-A Albuquerque Isotopes and was selected to the Pacific Coast League all-star team. Kansas City Royals On July 28, 2010, the Dodgers traded May, along with pitcher Elisaul Pimentel, to the Kansas City Royals for outfielder Scott Podsednik. He was assigned to play for the Omaha Royals. He was called up to the Royals on September 1, 2010 and made his Major League debut on September 4 against the Detroit Tigers, where he was hitless in three at-bats. On September 12 against the Chicago White Sox he recorded his first major league hit, a single to left field off of Matt Thornton.

Armand Neustadter Spitz (July 7, 1904 ‚Äì April 14, 1971) was an American planetarium designer.  Biography  Armand Spitz, the son of Louis Spitz and Rose (Neustadter), was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and was educated at the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Cincinnati, without receiving a degree from either. In 1926 he began working as a journalist, and within two years purchased a newspaper in Haverford, Pennsylvania. This went bankrupt in 1934, and Spitz traveled to France, discovering an interest in astronomy on the voyage to Europe. On his return to the United States, he became a lecturer on astronomical topics at Haverford College. As a side effort he made a papier-mache model of the Moon, which is on display to this day at the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia. Spitz became a volunteer at the new Fels Planetarium in Philadelphia, doing publicity, but soon was allowed to do planetarium lectures. He also created a series of radio programs in which he covered scientific topics, with an emphasis on astronomy. His first book, The Pinpoint Planetarium, appeared in 1940. The first half of the book described the sky and legends attached to it. The last half of the book contained star charts to be punched out and held in front of lamps, projecting stars in their proper relationships onto a wall or other smooth clear surface. Spitz dodecahedron planetarium projector (1953) A Spitz Junior home planetarium projector. About a million units were produced between 1954 and about 1972. Only five planetariums existed in the United States before 1940. Concerned that the only planetariums then available were so expensive that few institutions could have them and few people would live near enough to visit, in 1947 Spitz completed design work on a very inexpensive planetarium model. The main problem, he discovered, was that creating a globe for stellar projection was very complex and expensive. Spitz used a dodecahedron as the \\"globe\\" equivalent for his star projector, a suggestion from Albert Einstein. Following a demonstration at an astronomical conference at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, Spitz received considerable publicity, and began marketing his Model A planetarium for $500. These were sold to the various American military academies, small museums, schools, and even to King Farouk of Egypt. Within a few years, Spitz introduced the model A-1, which incorporated the Sun, Moon, and five naked eye planets, still using the dodecahedron shape for the star projector. Later a model A-2 came out, projecting more stars (the model A only gave stars brighter than magnitude 4.3). Just at the time that Sputnik caused the United States government to provide considerably enhanced funding for science education, Spitz produced his model A3P. This had a spherical star projector, and mechanized motions for the Sun, Moon and planets, and lunar phases. Well over a thousand of this model were ultimately sold, and in fact, when the Spitz company stopped making this model for a few years, had to bring it back due to continuing demand. By 1964 Spitz estimated that 300 to 400 planetariums existed in the United States. His company was developing the Space Transit Planetarium, a model with additional motion capabilities and more stars, when he suffered the first of a series of strokes in 1967. He went into semi- retirement after this, and died in Fairfax, Virginia.  His Projector Models and Advances  The A Series As noted, Spitz wanted to create a projector more affordable than the German Zeiss \\"all optical\\" projectors. Thus, all of his projectors used large \\"star balls\\" that relied on the pinhole lens principle, where star images became smaller (more realistic) as the starlight source (in center of the star ball) was more distant from the star-ball surface. Larger holes drilled into the star ball resulted in larger dots on the dome; thus practically all such projectors used lenses for the larger holes (brighter stars) to condense the dot. The earlier mentioned A series used a dodecahedron star \\"ball\\" for easier manufacture. Cherokee, Iowa had an A-1 in service from 1951, with Spitz helping with the opening, until a major digital renovation in 2016 (i.e. retired at 65 years). One improvement were additional,dimmer, stars. The A3/A3P Series used a true 18\\" diameter \\"star sphere\\" and vastly improved planet projectors that included motions at the proper orbital tilts and retrograde motion via his elegant \\"planet analogs\\", that is, analog computers. It also had a driven precessional axis and auxiliary projectors for a projected orrery and a simple meteorite projector. Some could be mounted on an elevator to accommodate other presentation modes. These models originally used an incandescent bulb for starlight source, which produced fuzzy images resembling the glowing filament. The A4 Series had a better starlight source: a unique xenon-arc lamp topped with a fisheye lens for dispersal across the top half of the starball. Due to the 180¬∞ limitation, the power- supply/lamp/lens assembly was mounted on leveling gimbals and incorporated a horizon cutoff mask to avoid projecting below-horizon stars. Another improvement is that control voltages were no longer at line (120VAC) levels, but at low voltages. It also improved the RA and declination axes projector, switching to optical projectors. It also had an azimuthal drive so that the star field could be rotated to the part of the dome facing patrons, avoiding neck-craning. The 512 Series resembled the A4, but with a major advancement: use of digital control voltages to the projector. This enabled the use of programmed sequences. The Big Model B Spitz departed from his earlier designs with the Model B, now using two very large star hemispheres in the Zeiss \\"dumbbell\\" configuration. Only 10 were installed in unique mounts. With very large star hemispheres, the star field would be expected to be very attractive. The STP Models The Space Transit Planetarium (variants in Miami, FL, US Air Force Academy,and Kansas City (all retired) One in East Lansing, MI is still in use) used digital computers to move planets to different positions. As the name implies, the STP's could simulate POVs from any location within our solar system.

In addition to motor vehicles, he applied for and received patents for Stirling engines, ignition systems, planing machines, and pulleys. He often promoted his inventions with grandiose and spurious claims, which would become a hallmark of his entrepreneurial schemes.Day, Richard, and Lewis, Byron R. \\"The Man Behind the Hoax: Pennington Spent Life Going Through Fortunes,\\" The Valley Advance, April 15, 1980 retrieved August 10, 2008. Frequently he collected financial backing for his business ventures, but rarely (if ever) did his investors ever collect any dividends from his projects.

He died in Springfield, Massachusetts after contracting meningitis from falling down in the street. Innovations E.J. Pennington is probably best known today for his pioneering motorcycles. He is sometimes credited with having invented the word \\"motorcycle\\"; he used the term as early as 1893. Pennington built and demonstrated his original motorcycle design in Milwaukee in 1895. Apparently not finding any backers for his idea he took it to England where he sold the patents for it to Harry John Lawson's The Great Horseless Carriage Company Limited in 1896 and joined that company's board of directors. Lawson had two more prototypes builtChadwick, Ian. \\"Pennington\\" (in list of) British motorcycle manufacturers P:, June 6, 2003, retrieved August 10, 2008. but nothing further came from the design. Pennington made many claims for his motorcycle, but it is doubtful if any of them are true. The design was very primitive and a few journalists of the time expressed doubts as to whether or not it would even run, though The Autocar reported in June 1896: \\"...although the motor required some little alteration, the speed developed was said to have varied from thirty to forty miles per hour.\\"Holmes, Timothy A.D. \\"Motorcycle Myth: Rebels without a Horse\\" International Journal of Motorcycle Studies, March 2007, retrieved on August 10, 2008. Notable features were that the engine's cranks were connected directly to the rear axle, the cylinders had no cooling fins, and Pennington made use of balloon tires - an invention he is also often credited with.\\"Inventors and Entrepreneurs\\" Racine, Wisconsin Claims to Fame, Wisconsin Internet, Inc., undated page , retrieved August 10, 2008. After his motorcycle plans came to nothing, Pennington working in conjunction with Lawson attempted to design a car bearing his own name. Although payments were taken for orders of this design, apparently none were ever delivered. Journalists speculated that the car was a failure in design, and The Horseless Age remarked sarcastically that: \\"...the Pennington car, which is not a car, since it does not carry, but has to be carried...\\" was partly responsible for bad press about the automobile in general and Lawson's motor syndicate in England at the time.

Intended to command cruiser squadrons operating on foreign stations, the ship served as the flagship of the North America and West Indies Station and the Mediterranean Fleet early in her career. Becoming obsolete as cruiser speeds increased, Renown became a royal yacht and had all of her secondary armament removed to make her more suitable for such duties. She became a stoker's training ship in 1909 and was listed for disposal in 1913. The ship was sold for scrap in early 1914. Design and description Production of a new 12-inch gun was behind schedule and the three battleships planned for the 1892 Naval Programme that were intended to use the new gun had to be delayed. In their stead, an improved design was chosen to keep the workers at Pembroke Dockyard fully employed. No formal requirement for a second-class battleship suitable for use as the flagship on foreign stations or to reinforce cruiser squadrons existed at the time, but the decision to build the ship was strongly influenced by the views of the Controller of the Navy, Rear Admiral John A. \\"Jacky\\" Fisher and the Director of Naval Intelligence, Captain Cyprian Bridge who favoured smaller ships with a smaller main armament and large secondary armament. They pressed for additional ships of this type as substitutes for the two other battleships originally programmed, but this was rejected by the Admiralty as there was no demand for additional second-class battleships.Burt, p. 101 The Director of Naval Construction, William Henry White, submitted three designs in early April 1892 and the smallest one was chosen on 11 April. The design was quite innovative in several different ways. It was the first battleship to use Harvey armour, which allowed the secondary casemates to be armoured, the first to use a sloping armour deck and the first to provide armoured shields over the main armament.Burt, pp. 101‚Äì02 General characteristics Renown had an overall length of , a beam of , and a draught of at deep load. She displaced at normal load and at deep load. The ship had a metacentric height of at deep load.Burt, pp. 105, 107 In 1903, the crew numbered between 651 and 674 officers and enlisted men. She was considered to handle well by her captains and was a good sea-boat. In view of her intended duties abroad, her bottom was coppered to reduce biofouling.Burt, pp. 102, 105 Propulsion Renown was powered by a pair of three-cylinder vertical triple-expansion steam engines, each driving a single propeller. Steam for the engines was provided by eight cylindrical boilers at a working pressure of . The engines were designed to produce a total of which was intended to allow her to reach a speed of . The engines proved to be more powerful than anticipated and Renown reached during sea trials under forced draught. The ship carried a maximum of of coal, enough to steam at .Burt, pp. 105, 108 Armament She was armed with four 32-calibre, breech-loading 10-inch Mk III guns in two twin-gun barbettes, one forward and one aft. Each gun was provided with 105 shells.Burt, p. 105 Her secondary armament consisted of ten 40-calibre quick- firing (QF) 6-inch Mk II guns. Half a dozen of these guns were mounted in casemates on the sides of the hull and the remaining guns were mounted on the upper deck in casemates in the superstructure. Defence against torpedo boats was provided by a dozen QF 12-pounder 12 cwt guns.\\"cwt\\" is the abbreviation for hundredweight, 12 cwt referring to the weight of the gun. Eight of these were mounted on the upper deck amidships. They fired , shells at a muzzle velocity of .Friedman, p. 111 200 rounds per gun were carried by each ship. Renown also carried eight QF 3-pounder Hotchkiss guns. Each gun was provided with 500 rounds of ammunition. She had five 18-inchThe actual diameter of these torpedoes was . torpedo tubes, one in the stern above water and two on each broadside underwater. Armour The ship's protection was generally composed of Harvey armour and her waterline main belt was thick. It was long amidships and high of which was below the waterline at normal load. Fore and aft oblique bulkheads, and ] thick, connected the belt armour to the barbettes. The upper strake of six-inch armour was long and high. It covered the ship's side between the rear of the barbettes up to the level of the main deck. Oblique bulkheads six inches thick connected the upper armour to the barbettes.Burt, pp. 105‚Äì06, 108 Renown was the first British battleship to be built with a sloped armoured deck behind the main belt as was commonly used on British protected cruisers. The top of the protective deck was even with the top of the main armoured belt and sloped down at 45¬∞ angle to meet the bottom of the belt. It was thick on the flat and on the slope and ran between the barbettes. Outside the barbettes, the lower deck was three inches thick and ran towards the ends of the ship.Burt, pp. 105‚Äì06 The barbettes were protected by armour plates. The gun turrets that protected the main armament were six inches thick on their face, with three-inch sides and a roof. They were initially built without a rear plate because of weight distribution problems with the turrets. The upper deck casemates were protected by plates on the front and sides, but the main deck casemates had six-inch faces and sides. The stern torpedo tube was protected by a mantlet three to six inches thick. The sides of the forward conning tower were thick while those of the rear conning tower were only three inches in thickness.Burt, pp. 104‚Äì06, 108 Construction and career HMS Renown, flagship of the North America and West Indies Station, at Halifax circa 1898 Renown was laid down at Pembroke Dockyard on 1 February 1893 and launched on 8 May 1895. She was completed in January 1897 at a cost of ¬£751,206, but then underwent lengthy sea trials that included the changing of her propeller blades that lasted until June. The ship commissioned on 8 June 1897 and served as flagship for the Commander-in-Chief, Vice Admiral Sir Nowell Salmon, VC, on 26 June, at the Fleet Review at Spithead for the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria, with the Prince of Wales aboard. She was briefly attached to the 1st Division, of the Channel Squadron, from 7 to 12 July for manoeuvres off the south coast of Ireland. On 24 August, Renown became Fisher's flagship, relieving the protected cruiser Crescent as flagship of the North America and West Indies Station. The ship continued as such until beginning a refit in May 1899.Burt, pp. 105, 108‚Äì09 Upon completion of her refit in July, she transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet, once again becoming Fisher's flagship. A strong proponent of the design of Renown, Fisher also found her highly desirable for the hosting of the social events required of a flagship in peacetime. Captain Hugh Tyrwhitt was appointed in command on 19 March 1900. Renown also underwent a special refit at Malta from February to May 1900 to meet Fisher's requirements for her. This included the transfer of the main deck 12-pounders to the superstructure. The ship recommissioned on 19 November 1900, and served as flagship until Fisher ended his tour as Commander-in-Chief on 4 June 1902, after which she continued to serve in the Mediterranean Fleet as a private ship under a new captain, Arthur Murray Farquhar. Renown participated in combined manoeuvres off Cephalonia and Morea between 29 September and 6 October 1902.Burt, pp. 108‚Äì10 HMS Renown, Halifax, Nova Scotia, 1898 After the manoeuvres ended, she was detached from the Mediterranean Fleet and returned to the United Kingdom to be specially fitted out at Portsmouth to carry the Duke and Duchess of Connaught on a royal tour of India. These modifications included removal of the main deck six-inch guns. After the modifications, she was nicknamed the \\"Battleship Yacht.\\" Renown carried the Duke and Duchess on their royal tour of India from November 1902 to March 1903. The ship rejoined the Mediterranean Fleet in April. In August, she relieved as flagship of the fleet so that the latter ship could undergo a refit. From 5 to 9 August 1903, Renown participated in manoeuvres off the coast of Portugal.Burt, pp. 108, 110 Renown was placed into reserve at Devon on 15 May 1904, although she participated in manoeuvres the following month. On 21 February 1905, the ship began a special refit at Portsmouth to configure her as a royal yacht. During the refit, the remainder of her secondary armament was removed to increase her accommodations.Chesneau & Kolesnik, p. 34 On 8 October, Renown left Portsmouth bound for Genoa, Italy. At Genoa, the Prince and Princess of Wales‚Äîthe future King George V and Queen Mary‚Äîembarked for a royal tour of India. The first-class protected cruiser escorted the ship during the tour. At the conclusion of the tour, Renown departed Karachi on 23 March 1906 and arrived at Portsmouth on 7 May. She was placed into reserve on 31 May.Burt, p. 110 In May 1907, Renown was attached to the Home Fleet as a \\"subsidiary yacht\\". Between October and December 1907, Renown carried King Alfonso XIII and Queen Victoria Eugenia of Spain on an official trip to and from the United Kingdom. The ship was transferred to the 4th Division, Home Fleet, at Portsmouth on 1 April 1909. Five months later, 25 September, she began a refit in Portsmouth Dockyard to convert her for use as a stoker's training ship. Renown briefly served as a tender to in OctoberGardiner & Gray, p. 7 before her refit was completed in November. During the Coronation Review at Spithead on 24 June 1911 for King George V, the ship was used as an accommodation ship. She was slightly damaged when water tanker Aid rammed her on 26 November 1911. Renown was offered for sale on 31 January 1913 and partially dismantled. In December 1913, she was moored at the Motherbank, awaiting disposal. On 1 April 1914 she was sold at auctionAuction was held at HM Dockyard, Portsmouth and included the condition that the ship must be broken-up to Hughes Bolckow for scrap at a price of ¬£39,000. She was broken up at Blyth.

Living Snakes of the World in Color. New York: Sterling Publishers. 480 pp. . is a species of snake in the family Boidae. The species is endemic to Northern and Eastern Africa. There are two subspecies which are recognized as being valid. Description Adult female specimens of G. colubrinus are rarely more than 91 cm (3 feet) in total length (including tail). The Kenyan sand boa is heavily built with a small head, small eyes, and a short tail. The color pattern may consist of a yellow or orange coloration overlaid with dark brown splotches. The belly is white or cream colored. It is readily available in the pet trade due to its small size, docility and ease of care. In recent years there have been a number of new morphs made available by both commercial and hobby breeders. Some of the more popular morphs available include anerythristic Kenyan sand boas (black and white lacking orange/red simple recessive trait), albino Kenyan sand boas (lacking black pigment simple recessive), snow KSBs (double recessive combination of an anery and albino), stripes (normal colored, anerythristic, albino and snow), hypo/ghost, anerythristic KSBs, paradox albinos (simple recessive), paradox snows (double recessive trait), splash (recessive), paint (recessive) and stripe combinations with any of the listed recessive traits. In addition many line bred traits have been accentuated on the above morphs, such as Nuclears (extreme red), High Whites, Reduced Patterns as examples. Common names Common names for G. colubrinus include East African sand boa, Egyptian sand boa, Kenyan sand boa, and sand boa. Geographic range Gongylophis colubrinus is found in northern Africa from Egypt as far west as Niger (A√Ør), including Somalia, Ethiopia, Sudan, Kenya, and northern Tanzania. A single specimen has been reported from Yemen. The type locality given is \\"√Ügypto\\". Habitat Gongylophis colubrinus occurs in semi-desert and scrub savannahs and rock outcroppings. It prefers sandy, friable soil. Behavior During the hotter times of the year, G. colubrinus seeks refuge beneath stones and in the burrows of small mammals. Behavior and diet Gongylophis colubrinus spends most of its time in shallow burrows with only its head exposed. It feeds on small mammals that are quickly seized when passing within striking range and killed by constriction. Reproduction Gongylophis colubrinus is ovoviviparous.http://shop.reptilecollective.com/blogs/news/15508596-kenyan- sand-boas In captivity, it breeds readily November through April in the United States, delivering live birth averaging 10-20 babies born spring through late summer.Huntley, Mark (2012).

He was a native of Alexandria who studied under Proclus in Athens. He eventually moved to Aphrodisias where he maintained a philosophy school jointly with another man also called Asclepiodotus, whose daughter, Damiane, he married. He wrote a commentary on Plato's Timaeus, which is however lost. He taught Damascius, who describes Asclepiodotus in disparaging terms, in part because of his disregard for oracular lore: > Asclepiodotus' mind was not perfect, as most people thought. He was > extremely sharp at raising questions, but not so acute in his understanding. > His was an uneven intelligence, especially when it came to divine matters - > the invisible and intelligible concept of Plato's lofty thought.

He and his wife visited the shrine of Isis at Menouthis in Egypt, in order to cure Damiane's childlessness.

The ship was laid down in the Laird Brothers shipyard in June 1894, she was launched in March 1896, and she was commissioned into the fleet in June 1897. She was armed with a main battery of four guns and a secondary battery of twelve guns. The ship had a top speed of . Mars served in the Channel Fleet after her commissioning, and in 1902 an accident with her forward main battery killed eleven men and badly damaged the turret. She was present at the Coronation Fleet Review for Edward VII later that year. She was reduced temporarily to the Reserve in March 1906 before returning to service with the Channel Fleet in October. The following March she was reassigned to the Home Fleet. As tensions in Europe rose dramatically in late July 1914, Mars was mobilized with her sister ships into the 9th Battle Squadron, based as a guard ship in the Humber. In December, she was transferred to the Dover Patrol, though in February 1915, she was decommissioned in Belfast and disarmed. Mars served as a troop ship during the Dardanelles Campaign before being converted into a depot ship. She remained in service until July 1920; the old ship was sold for scrap in May 1921 and broken up in November.  Design  Right elevation, deck plan, and hull section as depicted in Brassey's Naval Annual 1902 Mars was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of . She displaced up to at full combat load. Her propulsion system consisted of two 3-cylinder vertical triple-expansion steam engines powered by eight coal-fired cylindrical boilers. By 1907‚Äì1908, she was re-boilered with oil-fired models. Her engines provided a top speed of at . The Majestics were considered good seaboats with an easy roll and good steamers, although they suffered from high fuel consumption. She had a crew of 672 officers and ratings. The ship was armed with a main battery of four BL 12-inch Mk VIII guns in twin-gun turrets, one forward and one aft. The turrets were placed on pear-shaped barbettes; six of her sisters had the same arrangement, but her sisters and and all future British battleship classes had circular barbettes. Mars also carried a secondary battery of twelve QF 6-inch /40 guns. They were mounted in casemates in two gun decks amidships. She also carried sixteen QF 12-pounder guns and twelve QF 2-pounder guns for defence against torpedo boats. She was also equipped with five torpedo tubes, four of which were submerged in the ship's hull, with the last in a deck-mounted launcher. Mars and the other ships of her class had 9 inches (229 mm) of Harvey armour, which allowed equal protection with less cost in weight compared to previous types of armour. This allowed Mars and her sisters to have a deeper and lighter belt than previous battleships without any loss in protection. The barbettes for the main battery were protected with of armour, and the conning tower had the same thickness of steel on the sides. The ship's armoured deck was thick.  Service history  Mars underway c. 1898 HMS Mars was laid down at the Laird Brothers shipyard in Birkenhead on 2 June 1894. She was launched on 30 March 1896. She commissioned on 8 June 1897 for service with the Channel Fleet, where she served in the Portsmouth division. She was present at the Fleet Review at Spithead for the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria on 26 June 1897. Captain Henry John May was appointed in command on 5 January 1899, and succeeded by Captain Henry Deacon Barry who was appointed in command in September 1900. She took part in the Coronation Fleet Review for King Edward VII on 16 August 1902, and the following two months she was part of a squadron visiting Nauplia and Souda Bay at Crete for combined manoeuvres between the Channel and Mediterranean fleets. On 16 August 1904, Mars began a refit at Portsmouth. During her refit, the Channel Fleet became the Atlantic Fleet in a reorganization on 1 January 1905, and she remained in the renamed unit. Her refit was completed in March 1905. Her Atlantic Fleet service ended on 31 March 1906, when she commissioned into the Reserve at Portsmouth. Mars recommissioned at Portsmouth for service in the new Channel Fleet on 31 October 1906. This service ended when she paid off at Portsmouth on 4 March 1907. Mars recommissioned on 5 March 1907 for service in the Devonport Division of the new Home Fleet which had been organized in January 1907, and was based at Devonport. During this service, she underwent refits in 1908‚Äì1909 and 1911‚Äì1912. By July 1914, she was in the 4th Division, Home Fleet. With war appearing to be imminent, the Royal Navy undertook a precautionary mobilization on 27 July 1914. As part of this, Mars and her sister ships , , and formed the 9th Battle Squadron, which was based in the Humber under the Admiral of Patrols. Mars was serving as a guard ship at the Humber when World War I began in August 1914, and continued in that duty after the 9th Battle Squadron was dissolved on 7 August 1914. Mars was transferred to the Dover Patrol on 9 December 1914, and was based at Dover briefly before moving to Portland on 11 December 1914. She was based at Portland until February 1915. The Majestic-class ships were by then the oldest and least effective battleships in service in the Royal Navy. In February 1915, Mars transferred to Belfast, where she paid off on 15 February 1915. In March and April 1915 she was disarmed there by Harland and Wolff, retaining only four of her 6-inch (152-mm) guns and some lighter guns; her 12-inch (305-mm) guns were taken to arm the new monitors and . After that, she was laid up in Loch Goil in April 1915. In September 1915, Mars recommissioned to serve as a troopship in the Dardanelles campaign. Mars and her similarly disarmed sister ships Hannibal and Magnificent, also acting as troopships, arrived at Mudros on 5 October 1915. At the Dardanelles, Mars took part in the evacuation of Allied troops from Anzac Cove on 8 and 9 December 1915 and from West Beach at Cape Helles on 8 and 9 January 1916. During the West Beach evacuation, Mars was covered by what had once been her 12-inch (305-mm) guns, now mounted on Sir Thomas Picton. Mars returned to Devonport in February 1916, then paid off at Chatham, where she underwent a refit for conversion to a harbor depot ship. She recommissioned as a harbor depot ship on 1 September 1916, and served in this capacity at Invergordon until July 1920. Mars was placed on the sale list at Invergordon on 7 July 1920. She was sold for scrapping on 9 May 1921 and left Invergordon for scrapping at Briton Ferry in November 1921.

Hamilton City Council purchased the building in 1992 and restored the building as much as possible to original condition. The renovated building was opened as ArtsPost on 27 June 1998. It was given a Category 2 Heritage listing on 13 December 1990. = Casino = The 1940 building at 346 Victoria Street, which replaced the 1901 post office, was itself replaced in 1990, after which it was converted to Sky City Casino. It was designed by Hamilton architects Edgecumbe and White. It has been much modified, but retains an art deco Lenscrete dome, formed of glass and concrete, and is scheduled as Category A in Hamilton's proposed District Plan. Bank of New Zealand Building The former Bank of New Zealand building was the largest building of its kind in Hamilton when it was constructed in 1875. The two-storeyed building was designed by Edward Mahoney. A single storey was added to the rear extension in 1908 and a single storey extension was added between the original building and the neighbouring premises in 1932. The Bank of New Zealand left the building in 1986 and it was vacant until it was refurbished in 1994 as The Bank Bar and Brasserie. Its restoration signaled the beginning of a multimillion-dollar redevelopment at the south end of Victoria St. Wesley Chambers, corner of Victoria Street and Collingwood Street. Wesley Chambers Wesley Chambers was the first multistoreyed building in Hamilton made of reinforced concrete and the first to have a lift. The building was designed in the Chicago School style by Frederick Daniell. Wesley Chambers feature Sullivanesque-style windows with central panes flanked by narrower panes, and the unusual wrought iron balconies on two sides of the building. For most of its history, Wesley Chambers' upper floors were tenanted by some of the city's most prominent professional people including opticians, solicitors, accountants and dentists. In the 1980s and early 1990s, the building was vacant and but in 1993, it was transformed into a boutique hotel, the Le Grand. Hamilton Courthouse The Hamilton Courthouse, a concrete building on a hill above Anglesea Street, was built in 1931. It had two courtrooms - the Supreme Court and the Magistrates Court. In 1974, arsonists set fire to the building. The Magistrates Court was destroyed and the Supreme Court badly damaged. In 1993, a new court complex was built next to the old building. The old courthouse was unoccupied for a decade but in 2004, a refurbishment project was approved to restore the building as a working courthouse.  Municipal Baths  A decision was issued in January 2020 to permit demolition of the Municipal Baths at 26 Victoria St. The 1912 classical entrance was demolished in the 1980s, but the bath's relatively early reinforced concrete construction had earned it a Category B Heritage classification. Public art and statues same-sex marriage rally Riff Raff Statue The Riff Raff Statue commemorates Rocky Horror Picture Show creator Richard O'Brien, who lived in Hamilton. Weta Workshop was commissioned to create a statue of Riff Raff - one of the show's iconic characters played by O'Brien. The statue was unveiled on Victoria Street on 26 November 2004. The statue has a website and webcam at www.riffraffstatue.org. Te Tiaho o Matariki Located in Garden Place, Te Tiaho o Matariki was created by Neil Miller. The sculpture represents Pleiades in the form of a growing vine, with the stars of Matariki forming the fruit on the vine. It honours the city's first inhabitants (Garden Place was first used by Maori as a garden and observatory); and celebrates the horticultural heritage of the name of the city's civic plaza: Garden Place. The curving vine-like form of the sculpture also references the nearby Waikato River which snakes through the city. Ripples The Ripples sculpture was commissioned in 1987 for the opening of the Waikato Museum. It is a suspended sculpture, consisting of a six-metre span of carbon fibre reinforced polyester resin, which represents the ripple effects of a falling stone hitting the water. It hangs between the canopy of trees, approximately 20 metres in the air, above the Waikato Museum riverbank. It was created by Christchurch artist Neil Dawson. Millennium \\"Koru Family\\" Sculpture Located on the bank of the Waikato River, the Koru Family sculpture was given to Hamilton City by the Year 2000 Millennium Committee to commemorate the family in 2000. The sculpture was created by Carla Van de Veen of Te Aroha, made of Hinuera Stone. The Farming Family The Farming Family was donated to the city by businessman Sir Robert Jones in 1990 to commemorate the ordinary farming family as being the unsung heroes of Hamilton's 150-year history. The statue, a bronze life-sized sculpture created by Margriet Windhausen van den Berg, has sparked much debate about whether it solely celebrates the European history of the Waikato region. The Farming Family consists of a male farmer and his wife, two young children, a dairy cow, a sheep and a dog. The statue is located on a traffic island at the intersection of Victoria Street and Ulster Street.

Dorena was named by combining the first names of Dora Burnette and Lorena Martin. Dorena school was built in 1896, and Dorena post office was established in 1899. In 1946, the town was abandoned when the Corps of Engineers began construction of Dorena Dam on the Row River for flood control. The Corps relocated approximately one hundred homes from the town's former site at . The dam was completed in 1949 and created Dorena Reservoir, which flooded the townsite.

Intended for service in Asia, Glory and her sister ships were smaller and faster than the preceding s, but retained the same battery of four guns. She also carried thinner armour, but incorporated new Krupp steel, which was more effective than the Harvey armour used in the Majestics. Glory was laid down in December 1896, launched in March 1899, and commissioned into the fleet in November 1900. Glory spent much of her peacetime career abroad. She was assigned to the China Station from 1901 to 1905, before returning to British waters for a brief stint with the Channel Fleet and then the Home Fleet from late 1905 to early 1907. After a refit in 1907, she was then sent to the Mediterranean Fleet, where she remained until April 1909. She then returned to Britain and was reduced to reserve status. She remained inactive until the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914, at which time she was mobilised into the 8th Battle Squadron. In October 1914, Glory was transferred to the North America and West Indies Station, where she served as the squadron flagship. In June 1915, she was reassigned to the Mediterranean, and she took part in the Dardanelles Campaign, though she saw little action during that time, as her crew was needed ashore to support the troops fighting in the Gallipoli campaign. In August 1916, Glory was sent to Murmansk, Russia, to support Britain's ally by keeping the vital port open for supplies being sent for the Eastern Front. There, she served as the flagship of the British North Russia Squadron. She returned to Britain in 1919, was decommissioned, and was renamed HMS Crescent in 1920, before ultimately being sold to ship breakers in December 1922. Design Right elevation, deck plan and hull section as depicted in Brassey's Naval Annual 1906 Glory and her five sister ships were designed for service in East Asia, where the new rising power Japan was beginning to build a powerful navy, though this role was quickly made redundant by the Anglo-Japanese Alliance of 1902. The ships were designed to be smaller, lighter and faster than their predecessors, the s. Glory was long overall, with a beam of and a draft of . She displaced normally and up to full loaded. Her crew numbered 682 officers and ratings.Gardiner, p. 35 The Canopus-class ships were powered by a pair of 3-cylinder triple-expansion engines, with steam provided by twenty Belleville boilers. They were the first British battleships with water-tube boilers, which generated more power at less expense in weight compared with the fire-tube boilers used in previous ships. The new boilers led to the adoption of fore-and-aft funnels, rather than the side-by-side funnel arrangement used in many previous British battleships. The Canopus-class ships proved to be good steamers, with a high speed for battleships of their time‚Äî from ‚Äîa full two knots faster than the Majestics.Gardiner, pp. 34, 35 Glory had a main battery of four 35-calibre guns mounted in twin-gun turrets fore and aft; these guns were mounted in circular barbettes that allowed all-around loading, although at a fixed elevation. The ships also mounted a secondary battery of twelve 40-calibre guns mounted in casemates, in addition to ten 12-pounder guns and six 3-pounder guns for defence against torpedo boats. As was customary for battleships of the period, she was also equipped with four torpedo tubes submerged in the hull. To save weight, Glory carried less armour than the Majestics‚Äî in the belt compared to ‚Äîalthough the change from Harvey armour in the Majestics to Krupp armour in Glory meant that the loss in protection was not as great as it might have been, Krupp armour having greater protective value at a given weight than its Harvey equivalent. Similarly, the other armour used to protect the ship could also be thinner; the bulkheads on either end of the belt were thick. The main battery turrets were 10 in thick, atop barbettes, and the casemate battery was protected with 6 in of Krupp steel. Her conning tower had 12 in thick sides as well. She was fitted with two armoured decks, thick, respectively. Service history Pre-World War I Glory, c. 1903 HMS Glory was laid down at the Laird Brothers shipyard in Birkenhead on 1 December 1896. She was launched on 11 March 1899, and was commissioned on 1 November 1900 for service on the China Station, departing the United Kingdom for China on 24 November 1900 under the command of Captain Frederick Inglefield.Burt, p. 156 While there, she collided with the battleship during a storm at Hong Kong on 17 April 1901, when Centurion drifted across her bows, but Glory suffered no damage. In June 1901, Vice- Admiral Sir Cyprian Bridge, about to succeed as Commander-in-Chief of the China Station, hoisted his flag on the ship, and Captain Arthur William Carter succeeded Inglefield in command. Glory refitted at Hong Kong in 1901‚Äì1902,Burt, p. 156 and in November 1902 she visited Shanghai. In 1905, the United Kingdom and Japan ratified a treaty of alliance that reduced the need for a Royal Navy presence on the China Station, and all battleships there were ordered to return to Britain. As a result, Glory was recalled from China in July 1905, departing Hong Kong on 22 July 1905. Glory paid off at Portsmouth on 2 October 1905. She returned to full commission on 24 October 1905 for service in the Channel Fleet. On 31 October 1906, she transferred to the Portsmouth Reserve Division, which in January 1907 became the Portsmouth Division of the new Home Fleet. She underwent a refit at Portsmouth from March to September 1907, during which she received fire control and magazine cooling and had her machinery and boilers overhauled.Gardiner & Gray, p. 8 Her refit completed, Glory commissioned at Portsmouth on 18 September 1907 for service in the Mediterranean Fleet. On 20 April 1909, she paid off at Portsmouth and recommissioned for reserve duty with a nucleus crew in the 4th Division, Home Fleet, at the Nore. She became part of the 3rd Fleet at the Nore in May 1912 and transferred to Portsmouth in April 1913. World War I When World War I broke out in August 1914, Glory was assigned to the 8th Battle Squadron, Channel Fleet, based at Devonport, but she was detached on 5 August 1914 to serve at Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, as guard ship and to support the North America and West Indies Station cruiser squadron, arriving in Halifax on 17 August.Corbett (1920), p. 267 She served as the flagship of the station for Admiral Robert Hornby. She escorted a Canadian troop convoy in October 1914; she rendezvoused with the convoy on 5 October off Cape Race and covered the convoy for three days. On the 8th, Glory and the rest of her squadron members left the convoy, which was thereafter protected by the battlecruiser and the battleship .Corbett (1920), pp. 211‚Äì212 In mid-November, following Rear- Admiral Sir Christopher Cradock's defeat at the Battle of Coronel, the Royal Navy began shifting warships south to meet the German East Asia Squadron as it rounded Cape Horn into the Atlantic. Glory was initially ordered south to join the armoured cruisers , , and and the French armoured cruiser . Glory was delayed, however, as the armoured cruiser , which was to remain off New York City to watch German liners in the port, required an overhaul.Corbett (1920), p. 420 By February 1915, the North America and West Indies Squadron consisted of Glory, six cruisers, and one armed merchant cruiser.Corbett (1921), p. 422 Glory transferred to the Mediterranean in May 1915 to participate in Dardanelles campaign, arriving at the Dardanelles in June 1915. This was after the British and French fleets had made their attempts to force the straits in February, March, and April; by the time Glory arrived, the ground forces had gone ashore. As a result, the ship saw comparatively little activity.Corbett (1921), pp. 140‚Äì334Henderson, p. 244 This was in large part due to the fact that Glory was selected to send a large portion of her crew ashore to assist with the landing and distribution of weapons and stores. Since she did not have a full crew, she could not support the Landing at Suvla Bay in August.Henderson, p. 248 Indeed, Glory had not fired her guns at all until early October, when she joined the battleship to shell Ottoman positions at Gallipoli.Henderson, pp. 267‚Äì268 At the end of 1915 she left the Dardanelles and joined the Suez Canal Patrol in the Mediterranean on 4 January 1916. In April 1916, she returned to the United Kingdom and began a refit at Portsmouth that lasted until July 1916.Corbett (1923), pp. 89, 243 Glory was recommissioned on 1 August 1916 to serve as the flagship for Rear-Admiral Thomas Kemp, British North Russia Squadron, along with the protected cruiser and six minesweepers. She had some of her guns removed to increase accommodation space for more Royal Marines.Kinvig, pp. 8‚Äì9Corbett & Newbolt, p. 312 In this duty, she was based at Archangel to protect supplies that arrived there for the Russian Army. The squadron's mission evolved after the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917 into preventing the supplies that had been delivered from falling into the hands of the Red Army.Kinvig, p. 9 Nevertheless, Kemp maintained good relations with the local communist leadership; on 6 March 1918, Kemp reached an agreement with the authorities in Murmansk to send ashore a party of 130 marines from Glory to help defend the city from a feared invasion by neighboring Finland. She sent further men to reinforce the marines, along with Lewis guns and a 12-pounder gun, the latter from the armoured cruiser . Finnish forces attempted to seize nearby Pechenga as a first step toward advancing on Murmansk, but the attack broke down after Cochrane contributed marines and gunfire support to its defence. Finnish forces no longer threatened Murmansk.Kinvig, pp. 18‚Äì20 In September 1919, Glory returned to the United Kingdom. She paid off into care and maintenance on 1 November 1919 at Sheerness. She was renamed HMS Crescent in April 1920, and was transferred to Rosyth on 1 May 1920 to serve as a harbour depot ship. Crescent paid off and was placed on the disposal list on 17 September 1921. She was sold for scrapping on 19 December 1922. Notes References   * Further reading * Dittmar, F. J., & J. J. Colledge.

Service history Pre-World War I Launch of HMS Vengeance (1899) HMS Vengeance was laid down by Vickers at Barrow-in-Furness on 23 August 1898 and launched on 25 July 1899.Burt, p. 141 Her completion was delayed by damage to the fitting-out dock, and she was not completed until April 1902. She was the first British battleship completely built, armed, and engined by a single company. HMS Vengeance was commissioned at Portsmouth by Captain Leslie Creery Stuart on 8 April 1902 for service with the Mediterranean Fleet. She left the United Kingdom early the following month, arriving at Malta on 12 May. In September 1902 she visited the Aegean sea with other ships of the station for combined manoeuvres near Nauplia, and two months later she was back visiting Plataea. In July 1903 she transferred to the China Station to relieve her sister ship , and underwent a refit at Hong Kong in 1903‚Äì1904. In 1905, the United Kingdom and Japan ratified a treaty of alliance, reducing the need for a large Royal Navy presence on the China Station and prompting a recall of all battleships from the station.Burt, p. 97 Vengeance was recalled on 1 June 1905 and proceeded to Singapore, where she and her sister ship rendezvoused with their sister and the battleship . The four battleships departed Singapore on 20 June 1905 and steamed home in company, arriving at Plymouth on 2 August 1905. Vengeance paid off into the Devonport Reserve on 23 August 1905, and underwent a refit that lasted into 1906 during which her machinery was repaired.Gardiner & Gray, p. 8 On 15 May 1906, Vengeance commissioned for service in the Channel Fleet. She transferred to the Home Fleet on 6 May 1908, and on 13 June 1908 was damaged in a collision with the merchant ship at Portsmouth. She moved to the Nore Division, Home Fleet, at the Nore in February 1909, where she became a parent ship to special service vessels, and grounded in the Thames Estuary on 28 February 1909 without damage. In April 1909, she became tender to the Chatham Dockyard gunnery school, where she acted as a gunnery drill ship. On 29 November 1910, Vengeance suffered another mishap when she collided in fog with the merchant ship , suffering damage to her side, net shelf, and net booms. Vengeance then served in the 6th Battle Squadron based at Portland, then became a gunnery training ship at the Nore in January 1913.Burt, p. 157 The 6th Squadron, together with the 5th Battle Squadron, formed the core of the Second Fleet.Corbett (1920), p. 12 World War I Vengeance in 1908 On the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914, the Royal Navy mobilised to meet the German High Seas Fleet. On 7 August, the 6th Battle Squadron was dissolved, the more modern s being transferred to the Grand Fleet;Corbett (1920), pp. 75‚Äì77 Vengeance was assigned to the 8th Battle Squadron, Channel Fleet. The 8th Squadron was tasked with patrol duties in the English Channel and Atlantic, though Vengeance was quickly transferred to the 7th Battle Squadron on 15 August 1914 to relieve the battleship as the squadron flagship. Shortly thereafter, half of the 7th Squadron battleships were dispersed to strengthen the detached cruiser squadrons patrolling for German commerce raiders, leaving only Vengeance, Prince George, , and Goliath and the protected cruiser . She covered the landing of the Plymouth Marine Battalion at Ostend, Belgium, on 25 August 1914. For this operation, she and the other five ships of the squadron, along with six destroyers, escorted the troopships; at the same time, elements of the Grand Fleet attacked the German patrol line off Heligoland to occupy the High Seas Fleet.Corbett (1920), pp. 85, 98‚Äì100 In November 1914, she was transferred to Alexandria to replace a pair of older French vessels, the battleship and the armoured cruiser that had in turn relieved the armoured cruisers and as guard ships for the Suez Canal.Corbett (1920), p. 385 She later moved on to the Cape Verde-Canary Islands Station to relieve Albion as guard ship at Saint Vincent.Burt, p. 157-158 =Dardanelles campaign= Map showing the Ottoman defences at the Dardanelles in 1915 On 22 January 1915, Vengeance was selected to take part in the Dardanelles campaign. She stopped at Gibraltar that month to embark Admiral John de Robeck and become second flagship of the Dardanelles squadron, and arrived at the Dardanelles in February 1915.Burt, p. 158Corbett (1921), pp. 140‚Äì141 Admiral Sackville Carden, the commander of the British Mediterranean Fleet, devised a plan to force the straits and attack the Ottoman capital by neutralising the Ottoman coastal defences at long range, clearing the minefields in the Dardanelles, and then entering the Sea of Marmara.Corbett (1921), p. 143 Vengeance participated in the opening bombardment of the Ottoman Turkish entrance forts on 18 February and 19 February 1915, though her role as de Robeck's flagship limited her to observing the fire of the other ships in his formation. The battleship developed problems with her capstan and so could not anchor in her firing position, forcing Vengeance to take her place. She bombarded the Orkanie fortress with direct fire, but aerial reconnaissance proved that the fortress guns had not been disabled. Nevertheless, Carden ordered Vengeance and several other battleships to close with their targets and engage them at close range. The French battleship joined Vengeance in shelling Orkanie. Later in the afternoon, both ships began to engage a battery at Kumkale with their main guns, while their secondary battery kept firing at Orkanie. At 16:10, Carden ordered them to cease fire and inspect the fortification. On closing, Vengeance came under heavy fire from Orkanie and a battery at Cape Helles. Contre-amiral (Rear Admiral) √âmile Gu√©pratte, the commander of the French contingent, later wrote that \\"the daring attack of the Vengeance in flinging herself against the forts when their fire was in no way reduced was one of the finest episodes of the day.\\" She suffered some damage to her masts and rigging from gunfire from the forts, but she was not hit directly. Several other battleships came to her aid, and at 17:20, Carden ordered a retreat.Corbett (1921), pp. 144‚Äì148 On 25 February, Vengeance took part in another attack on the Dardanelles fortresses. Along with Cornwallis and the French battleships Suffren and , she led the assault, which was supported by one French and three British battleships. Once the four supporting battleships had taken up their positions and begun firing at long range to suppress the Ottoman batteries, Vengeance and Cornwallis made the first pass at close range, intending to destroy the guns with direct hits. De Robeck took Vengeance to within of the fortifications at Kumkale and fired for ten minutes, before turning about to allow Cornwallis to engage the guns. The two French ships then followed, and by 15:00, the Ottoman guns had been effectively silenced, allowing for minesweepers to advance and attempt to clear the minefields; most of the fleet withdrew while the minesweepers worked, though Vengeance and the battleships and remained behind to cover them. By clearing these fields, Allied warships could now enter the Dardanelles themselves, opening the route to attack additional fortifications around the town of Dardanus. While other vessels shelled the forts there, Vengeance and the battleship sent men ashore to destroy an abandoned artillery battery near Kumkale, with both ships remaining off shore to support the raid. The men landed unopposed, but the detachment from Vengeance quickly came under fire from Ottoman infantry on the far side of Kumkale. Lieutenant-Commander Eric Gascoigne Robinson, who led Vengeances demolition party, went forward by himself to destroy an Ottoman anti-aircraft gun, then led his detachment to destroy a second anti-aircraft gun and the one remaining gun at the Orkanie battery. For his actions, he was awarded the Victoria Cross. Ottoman resistance prevented any further action, and the men returned to Vengeance.Corbett (1921), pp. 157‚Äì165 By late February, Vengeance was in need of boiler maintenance, so de Robeck transferred his flag to Irresistible while Vengeance went to Mudros for repairs. She had returned by 6 March, in time for another bombardment of the Ottoman defences; de Robeck again transferred his flag back to the ship for the operation. This time, the plan involved using Albion to spot for the powerful dreadnought battleship , which was to fire indirectly in the hopes of being able to neutralise the Ottoman guns at a range at which they could not respond. Vengeance and three other battleships covered Albion inside the straits. The ships quickly silenced the Ottoman guns at Dardanus, but mobile artillery batteries continually forced both Albion and Queen Elizabeth to shift position, largely preventing the latter from firing and the former from relaying corrections for the few shots Queen Elizabeth had been able to make. Nightfall and the lack of progress led to the operation being called off. Two days later, Queen Elizabeth was sent into the straits in an attempt to destroy the guns with direct fire, while Vengeance and three other battleships covered her from the mobile howitzers. Poor visibility hampered Queen Elizabeths gunners, and at 15:30 Carden called off the attack, having achieved nothing.Corbett (1921), pp. 166, 189‚Äì194 Vengeance also took part in the main attack on the Narrows forts on 18 March 1915, by which time Carden had fallen ill and had to resign, leaving de Robeck to take overall command of the fleet. He therefore shifted his flag to Queen Elizabeth, and Vengeance returned to the Second Division as a private ship. Vengeance did not engage the Ottomans until later in the afternoon, after Bouvet had been mined and sunk. Vengeance attacked the Ottoman \\"Hamidieh\\" battery, but most of her shells fell harmlessly in the center of the fortification, away from the guns. When it became clear that the Ottoman fortresses could not be silenced in time to allow the minesweepers to begin clearing the minefields further in the straits, de Robeck ordered the fleet to withdraw. In the process, two British battleships were also mined and sunk, and the battlecruiser had also struck a mine, though she managed to return to Malta for repairs.Corbett (1921), pp. 213, 218‚Äì222 By late-April, the First Squadron included Vengeance, seven other battleships, and four cruisers, and was commanded by Rear Admiral Rosslyn Wemyss. The First Squadron was tasked with supporting the Landing at Cape Helles, which took place on 25 April.Corbett (1921), pp. 310, 314 Vengeance and the battleship were initially assigned to support the landing at Morto Bay, taking up their firing positions at 05:00 and opening fire at Ottoman positions in the heights around the bay shortly thereafter. Lord Nelson was later sent to support other landing beaches further south on the peninsula, and Vengeance was joined by Prince George. As the allied ground forces advanced on Krithia, Vengeance and several other battleships provided fire support, though the Ottomans blocked the attack in the First Battle of Krithia.Corbett (1921), pp. 335, 337, 345, 362 Through early May, she remained off the beachhead, supporting the allied right flank along with Lord Nelson and the French battleship .Corbett (1921), p. 377 She supported the ground troops during the Ottoman attack on Allied positions at Anzac Cove on 19 May 1915, before retiring to Mudros to replenish her fuel and ammunition. She returned to Gallipoli on 25 May to relieve her sister . A submarine attacked her that day while she was steaming up from Mudros, but Vengeance quickly turned to starboard to avoid the torpedo and fired several shots at the submarine's periscope, forcing her to withdraw.Corbett (1923), pp. 28‚Äì29 By July 1915, Vengeance had boiler defects that prevented her from continuing combat operations, and she returned to the United Kingdom and paid off that month. She was under refit at Devonport until December 1915. =Later service= Vengeance recommissioned in December 1915 and left Devonport on 30 December 1915 for a deployment to East Africa. The Royal Navy had begun sending reinforcements to the area in November to support the East African Campaign; on her arrival there, she joined three monitors, two cruisers, two armed merchant vessels, and two gunboats.Newbolt, p. 85 While there, she supported operations leading to the capture of Dar es Salaam in 1916. In February 1917, Vengeance returned to the United Kingdom and paid off. She was laid up until February 1918, when she recommissioned for use in experiments with anti-flash equipment for the fleet's guns. She completed these in April 1918, and then was partially disarmed, with four 6-inch (152-mm) main-deck casemate guns removed and four 6-inch guns being installed in open shields on the battery deck. She became an ammunition store ship in May 1918. Vengeance was placed on the sale list at Devonport on 9 July 1920, and was sold for scrapping on 1 December 1921. She had an eventful trip to the scrapyard. After she departed Devonport under tow on 27 December 1921 en route to Dover, her tow rope parted in the English Channel on 29 December 1921. French tugs located her and towed her to Cherbourg, France. From there she was towed to Dover, where she finally arrived for scrapping on 9 January 1922.

Categories of mythic humanoids The multitude of mythic humanoids can be divided into four categories. Human skinned humanoids These humanoids can pass unnoticed in human society if their attributes are small enough to go unnoticed. Their ears may be slightly misshaped, their eyes may not line up, or their height may not measure up, but their difference in appearance can be attributed to genetic mistakes or mutation. Sometimes they live separated from society, live in alternative realities, or appear at night or under specific circumstances. This category includes witches, elves, fairies, nymphs, house spirits, semibeings. Some are believed to be not alive but in recent days, They as well might be Monster skinned humanoids Portions of these humanoids are clearly not of human make. They may have drastic differences in skin color and eye type and may have scales, fur, claws, and tails. The average person may find them quite unpleasant and untrustworthy because they are not entirely human. An example is the Kyubi no kitsune, found in Japanese folklore. Monstrous humanoids These humanoids are likely to instill fear and revulsion. They may walk, talk, and think like a human, but they are obviously not human. Some examples of these monsters are demons and vampires. Temporary form humanoids These are creatures that may temporarily disguise or transform into a human shape, but have entirely different true forms.

He was the son and successor of Harvey II. His reign was spent in constant rebellion against his nominal lords in an effort to preserve his historical independence.  Life  In August 1167 Henry II of England marched on L√©on and captured or razed Guihomar's major castles, forcing the baron to submit and grant hostages. Guihomar succeeded his father soon after. He followed his father in trying to preserve his de facto independence from ducal authority and foreign influence. Most especially he sought to protect his economic interest in the right of wreck, famously declaring that he possessed \\"the most valuable of precious stones,\\" a rock which generated 100,000 solidi per annum in revenue due to shipwrecks. By 1169 Guihomar was in revolt and Henry ordered Conan IV of Brittany, who was also lord of Tr√©guier, which conveniently marched on L√©on, to put down the disturbance. Conan campaigned against him in 1170, defeating him once but failing to secure his submission. After Conan's death in February 1171, Guihomar rebelled once more and Henry himself, marching from Pontorson, led the campaign against him, which culminated in the loss of his castles, all of which were razed save three which Henry kept. Guihomar formally submitted in May at Pontorson. He was ordered to return all lands confiscated from his neighbours or vassals or submit to royal judgement (coram rege). In January 1171 Guihomar had ordered the murder of his younger brother, Hamo, Bishop of Saint-Pol de L√©on. The parallels between this and the murder of Thomas Becket (1170), of which Henry was accused, probably encouraged decisive action on the king's part, so as to present himself as a defender of the assassinated churchman. In August 1177 Henry's son, Geoffrey II of Brittany, at his father's request, led a campaign against Guihomar, who was again in rebellion. Guihomar submitted his lands to Henry, but by April 1179 was in revolt once again. It was his final revolt. Geoffrey, at his father's request, again led the campaign against him, but he was harsher this second time, confiscating the whole of L√©on to the Duchy of Brittany. Guihomar agreed to undergo a pilgrimage to Jerusalem and subsist in the meanwhile off the revenues of two parishes until the following Christmas, but he died on 27 or 28 September 1179 before any of this could take place.  Issue  Guihomar married Nobilis (possibly a member of the de Ch√¢teaulin family); they had: * Guihomar V (c. 1151‚Äìaft. 1216), who succeeded his father as Viscount of L√©on * Harvey (1153‚Äì1208), who became the first Lord of L√©on as Harvey I * Adam, who participated in the Third Crusade and died in 1190 or 1191 at the Siege of Acre * Eleanor (d. aft. 1191), who married Odo II, Viscount of Porho√´t and Duke of Brittany from 1148 to 1156 * Enoguen/Gwen, who married Andrew II, Baron of Vitr√© about 1190 * Sybille (d. aft. 1166) married Geoffrey of Boisgelin Notes Sources 1179 deaths Viscounts of L√©on House of L√©on Year of birth unknown 12th-century Breton people Year of birth uncertain ","title":"Guihomar IV, Viscount of L√©on"},{"id":"14371139","text":"\\"Eternal Moonshine of the Simpson Mind\\" is the ninth episode of The Simpsons' nineteenth season. It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on December 16, 2007. The episode averaged 10.15 million viewers, winning in its time slot and receiving a 12 percent audience share.Ratings, The Hollywood Reporter The episode follows Homer's attempts to recall a deliberately forgotten memory from the previous night. At the 2008 Primetime Emmy Awards, the episode won the award for Outstanding Animated Program (for Programming Less Than One Hour). The episode received positive reviews from critics, who often cited it as the best of the season. In 2014, showrunner Al Jean selected it as one of five essential episodes in the show's history. Plot One Winter morning, Homer wakes up in a pile of snow and does not remember the events of the previous day, commenting that he must have drunk heavily the night before. Homer goes home and finds his family absent and Santa's Little Helper attacks him, though Homer manages to subdue him before escaping. Homer travels to Moe's, where Moe informs him that he was there the previous night and wanted to forget an unpleasant memory. Moe explains he gave Homer a \\"Forget-Me-Shot\\", which wiped out the last 24 hours of his memory. Chief Wiggum tells Homer that there was a domestic disturbance at his house last night, which was reported by Ned Flanders. Homer instantly receives a flashback to the night before showing Wiggum questioning Marge about a black eye she had received, to which Marge nervously replies that she walked into a door. At the Flanders house, Homer asks Ned what he has done last night; Ned admits that he does not know but assumed the worst. A still confused Homer goes home, where a picture of Marge causes a flashback of her pleading Homer to stop, and then rubbing her eye in pain. Horrified at the thought of hurting Marge, Homer goes to Grampa Simpson for help. Grampa tells Homer about Professor Frink's new machine that helps people sort through their memories. With the help of this technology, Homer sees himself walking in on Marge with another man in an allegedly compromising position. In the flashback, Marge tells Homer that she did not want him to find out about it, so Homer decides to use Bart and Lisa from a memory of a snow day to help him unmask the man's identity. With their help, Homer is able to jog his memory, which reveals the man to be Duffman. Homer then concludes that Marge was cheating on him with Duffman, resulting in him beating his wife in retaliation. Homer now considers his life to be worthless and decides to commit suicide by jumping off a bridge. He begins to reconsider, but is pushed off by his \\"guardian angels,\\" Patty and Selma. While falling, Homer's life flashes before his eyes. He then sees the full memory of the preceding night: Marge was planning a surprise party for Homer finishing his community service, and did not want Homer to find out about it. Duffman, who was hired by Marge to entertain at the party, brings out a bottle of Duff Champagne. Overjoyed, Homer tries to open the bottle, while Marge pleads with Homer to stop, as she wants to save it for the party. The cork flies off and hits Marge in the eye. The flashback ends and, instead of falling to his death, Homer lands on a moon bounce, which is at the surprise party on board a ship. Lenny and Carl appear and cause a flashback which shows Homer telling his bar buddies that he felt very guilty for finding out about the party that Marge worked so hard on. When Moe offers the Forget- Me-Shot (which Moe spat in), Homer predicts exactly what is going to happen, and tells Lenny to make sure there is a moon bounce at the party. As Homer now deduces, the entire town was in on the plot, concealing the party and counting on Homer to get there in genuine surprise, with Patty and Selma pushing him down to get him to the party, which they nervously admit. When Homer asks Marge why she lied to Chief Wiggum, she claims that she did not want him at the party, because he would bring Sarah Wiggum, whom Marge does not like. Finally, Bart reveals that the dog attacked Homer because he does not take care of him. As the party commences in full swing, Homer opts not to drink this time, telling Marge that this moment at the party and the effort she put into it is what he wants to remember. Production In an interview with Entertainment Weekly regarding the renewal of the show in season 23, showrunner Al Jean discusses what episodes that have previously aired might serve well as a series finale. He regards \\"Behind the Laughter\\" and \\"Eternal Moonshine of the Simpson Mind\\" as the strongest candidates, and further elaborates: \\"I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre a serialized show and I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre going to have a Lost finale where we reveal some truth about the world that nobody ever suspected. Whenever we do a last episode, we just hope that it would be sweet, true to the characters, funny, and give you a nice feeling for where the Simpsons would be headed.\\" Cultural references The episode's title and the plot of Homer trying to erase an unpleasant memory refers to the film Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.The Simpsons: Eternal Moonshine of the Simpson Mind, December 16, 2007, TV Squad Homer's life appears in the form of a YouTube video, which is a spoof of Noah Kalina's \\"Noah Takes a Photo of Himself Every Day for 6 Years\\", which features the like-titled piano music of Carly Comando's piece \\"Everyday\\" featured in the original video. Scrat, the squirrel from Ice Age, makes an appearance trying to catch an acorn off a tree, but is beaten and swatted away by Groundskeeper Willie. Krusty states that he was trying to do a \\"Don Rickles about Arabs\\" but it turned into a \\"Mel Gibson about Mexicans\\", referencing the incident when Gibson ranted and yelled anti-Semitic slurs, along with Rickles' history of making jokes about every race and religious group he can come up with but remaining funny and popular anyway. The memory of Homer's first kiss, which he destroys, is from the Season 15 episode, \\"The Way We Weren't\\". The scene where Homer is standing on a bridge, ready to jump off, is a reference to the film It's a Wonderful Life. The scene where Moe tells Homer that he spits in his drinks, just before Homer drinks the \\"Forget-Me-Shot\\", copies a similar scene in the film Memento. The episode also vaguely references the film The Game at various points in the episode, especially during the scene when Homer attempts to take his own life. The music playing at the end of the episode is a version of \\"Day After Day\\" by Badfinger. When Chief Wiggum asks Homer if he knows who Jack the Ripper was, he answers Queen Victoria's personal doctor. In the chalkboard gag, Bart makes a reference to the hit Disney show Hannah Montana when he's writing \\"The Capital of Montana is not Hannah\\". Reception In its original American broadcast, \\"Eternal Moonshine of the Simpson Mind\\" was viewed by an estimated 10.15 million households, won in its time slot, and received a 4.8 rating/12 audience share. Robert Canning of IGN enjoyed the episode, saying it \\"did both very well by putting Homer in his own head as he tried to recall the events that transpired the previous day. Smart, funny and visually engaging, this episode was an absolute pleasure to watch.\\" He gave it an 8.8/10 rating, and cited it as the season's high point. TV Squad's Richard Keller wrote that \\"by far, this was the most interesting episode of [the nineteenth season], incorporating humor, romance, and a little bit of science fiction into a tidy little plot. [...] True, it was another Homer-centric episode ‚Äì one of too many this season, but the writers gave the show enough of a twist to keep it intriguing for the viewer.\\" In another IGN article, Robert Canning, Eric Goldman, Dan Iverson, and Brian Zoromski named \\"Eternal Moonshine of the Simpson Mind\\" the best episode of the season, with the rationale that \\"it's the episode's fantastic visuals that truly make this a memorable episode.\\" In 2012, Matt Zoller Seitz of New York magazine deemed \\"Eternal Moonshine of the Simpson Mind\\" one of nine later Simpsons episodes that was as good as the show's classic era. Screen Rant called it the best episode of the 19th season. At the 2008 Primetime Emmy Awards, the episode won the award for Outstanding Animated Program (for Programming Less Than One Hour).

These Syeds came here from Uch Sharif (Bahawalpur District) via Jahanian (Khanewal District 42 km from Multan). These were the descendants of Jahaniyan Jahangasht a famous Sufi saint. The family‚Äôs lineage is linked to Jalaluddin Surkh-Posh Bukhari of Uch Sharif (Punjab, Pakistan) and that makes the lineage the descendents of Imam Naqi (Ali al-Hadi); the descendent of Imam Ali and the Islamic prophet Muhammad.

Built to counter a group of fast Russian battleships, Montagu and her sister ships were capable of steaming at , making them the fastest battleships in the world. The Duncan-class battleships were armed with a main battery of four guns and they were broadly similar to the s, though of a slightly reduced displacement and thinner armour layout. As such, they reflected a development of the lighter second-class ships of the . Montagu was built between her keel laying in November 1899 and her completion in July 1903. The ship had a brief career, serving for two years in the Mediterranean Fleet before transferring to the Channel Fleet in early 1905. During wireless telegraphy experiments in May 1906, she ran aground off Lundy Island. Repeated attempts to refloat the ship failed, and she proved to be a total loss. She was ultimately broken up in situ. Design Right elevation and deck plan as depicted in Brassey's Naval Annual 1915 The six ships of the were ordered in response to the Russian s that had been launched in 1898. The Russian ships were fast second-class battleships, so William Henry White, the British Director of Naval Construction, designed the Duncan class to match the purported top speed of the Russian vessels. To achieve the higher speed while keeping displacement from growing, White was forced to reduce the ships' armour protection significantly, effectively making the ships enlarged and improved versions of the s of 1896, rather than derivatives of the more powerful , , and series of first-class battleships.

The Duncan-class ships were powered by a pair of 4-cylinder triple- expansion engines that drove two screws, with steam provided by twenty-four Belleville boilers. The boilers were trunked into two funnels located amidships. The Duncan-class ships had a top speed of from . This made Montagu and her sisters the fastest battleships in the world for several years. At a cruising speed of , the ship could steam for . Montagu had a main battery of four 40-calibre guns mounted in twin-gun turrets fore and aft. The ships also mounted a secondary battery of twelve 45-calibre guns mounted in casemates, in addition to ten 12-pounder guns and six 3-pounder guns for defence against torpedo boats. As was customary for battleships of the period, she was also equipped with four torpedo tubes submerged in the hull. Montagu had an armoured belt that was thick; the transverse bulkhead on the aft end of the belt was thick. The sides of her main battery turrets were thick, atop barbettes, and the casemate battery was protected with 6 in of Krupp steel. Her conning tower had 12-inch-thick sides. She was fitted with two armoured decks, thick, respectively. Service history The keel for HMS Montagu was laid down on 23 November 1899, and her completed hull was launched on 5 March 1901. She began sea trials in February 1903 and was commissioned into the fleet on 28 July at Devonport Dockyard for service in the Mediterranean Fleet. In February 1905, she transferred to the Channel Fleet. Grounding and loss In late May 1906, Montagu tested new wireless telegraphy equipment in the Bristol Channel, sending and receiving test messages with wireless stations ashore. Late on 29 May, she was anchored off Lundy Island, but could not pick up the messages from the test station, so the ship weighed anchor to steam to the Isles of Scilly. Heavy fog forced her to reverse course and steam back to Lundy Island after four hours, but her navigator miscalculated the course, placing her some two miles off her original track. Montagu encountered a pilot cutter cruising in the vicinity of Lundy Island, slowed to a stop, and came alongside the cutter to request a distance and bearing for Hartland Point on the mainland. Though the cutter supplied these accurately, the voice from the battleships bridge replied that they must be wrong and that the pilot cutter must have lost her bearings. As Montagu restarted her engines and began to move ahead, the cutter shouted back that on her present course Montagu would be on Shutter Rock within ten minutes, and a short time later the sound of the battleship running aground carried through the fog. left At 02:00 on 30 May, Montagu ran aground on Shutter Rock, suffering a gash on her starboard side. Unable to free herself from the rocks, she slowly filled with water; twenty-four hours later, her starboard engine room and all of her boiler rooms were flooded, among others. Her crew counter-flooded the port engine room to prevent her from listing further to starboard. Divers inspected the hull to determine the extent of the damage, which proved to be more serious than initially expected. The bottom of the ship also received extensive damage, including several other holes and the port propeller shaft having been torn from the hull. The starboard bilge keel was also ripped from the hull, as was the rudder. The wreck rested on a fairly even bottom, so there was hope that the ship could be refloated. Since the Royal Navy had no dedicated salvage unit, it turned to Frederick Young, a former Royal Navy captain who now worked as the chief salvage officer of the Liverpool Salvage Association. Young was at that time the foremost expert on marine salvage in Britain, so he was hired to advise Admiral Sir Arthur Wilson, the commander of the Channel Fleet, who had no experience in salvage operations. The navy initially hoped to lighten the ship by removing the medium and small-caliber guns and other equipment that could be easily taken off and then to pump out the water so that the holes in the hull could be patched. By the end of June, some twenty pumps had been assembled on the scene, with a total pumping capacity of of water per hour. Difficulties with pumping, owing in part to the subdivision of the internal compartments and the need to reflood the ship during high tide to keep her from suffering more damage before the hull could be patched, led the salvors to give up the operation. Wilson next sought to remove armour plate from the sides of the ship and to erect a series of caissons, at which point a powerful air pump would be used to blow the water out of the hull. The caissons repeatedly broke free even in mild seas, and the air pump failed to have the desired effect. Her sister ship herself ran aground whilst trying to help the salvage effort, though she was successfully freed. At the end of the summer of 1906, salvage efforts were suspended for the year, with plans to resume them in 1907. However, an inspection of the ship conducted from 1 to 10 October 1906 found that the action of the sea was driving her further ashore and bending and warping her hull so that her seams were beginning to open, her deck planking was coming apart, and her boat davits had collapsed. Having failed to refloat Montagu, the navy decided to abandon the project. Further material was removed from the wreck, including her main battery guns, which were later re-used in other vessels. The Western Marine Salvage Company of Penzance completed salvage of the wreck for scrap metal over the next 15 years. The court martial convened for the affair blamed the thick fog and faulty navigation for the wreck. The trial was held aboard . The ship's captain, Thomas Adair. and the navigation officer, Lieutenant James Dathan, were severely reprimanded, with both men being dismissed from HMS Montagu; Dathan lost two years of seniority in rank as well. The wreck site, which now amounts to little more than some armour plate on the sea floor, is a popular diving location. Divers have also located parts of her gun turrets and shells that were not recovered during the salvage operation. In September 2019 the British Government granted the wreck site‚Äîincluding the steps which had been chiseled out of the cliff during the salvage effort‚Äîprotected status.

She was used by the Union Navy as a gunboat in support of the Union Navy blockade of Confederate waterways. Commissioned in New York City in 1862 William Bacon‚Äîa wooden-hulled schooner‚Äîwas purchased by the Union Navy on 6 September 1861 from Van Brunt and Slaight and commissioned at the New York Navy Yard, Brooklyn, New York, on 3 February 1862, Acting Master William P. Rogers, USN, in command. Assigned to the West Gulf Blockade mortar flotilla Assigned to the mortar flotilla attached to Flag Officer David Glasgow Farragut's West Gulf Blockading Squadron, William Bacon departed New York City under tow on 6 February and arrived at Key West, Florida, on 18 February. The next day, she shifted to Pilot Town. The need to pass Forts Jackson and St. Philip Flag Officer Farragut gathered his forces at the mouth of the Mississippi River to commence one phase of the move designed to split the Confederacy asunder along that major waterway. Defending the mouth of that key artery were Forts Jackson and St. Philip, mounting between them 115 guns, in addition to a heavy barrier of chained hulks and logs that lay in the river below the forts to obstruct the passage. William Bacon furtively ascends the Mississippi River The steamer took William Bacon under tow on the morning of 11 April and, at 0915, headed upriver; at 1300, the crew on board the mortar schooner began dressing the masts with green bushes in an attempt to camouflage the ship‚Äîa standard practice throughout the flotilla as it began to clear for action with the Confederate forces upstream. Bombarding the forts with mortar fire while Farragut makes his run William Bacon and the other ships of the mortar flotilla kept up a steady, heavy fire on the two Confederate forts over the next week. Farragut's squadron, meanwhile, battered their way through the barrier and successfully made passage. Three days later, the forts‚Äîheavily battered by the shells from the mortar flotilla and surrounded on the landward sides by the Army's expeditionary forces under General Benjamin Franklin Butler‚Äîsurrendered, thus removing a formidable barrier to the Federal operations. William Bacon, her task in the reduction of the forts completed, dropped down the river to Southwest Pass, where she awaited further orders. Reassigned to the North Atlantic blockade Because of the enervating climate, however, William Bacon did not tarry long at the mouth of the Mississippi River. She sailed for Hampton Roads, Virginia, soon thereafter and refitted there into the summer. Briefly assigned to the Potomac Flotilla, William Bacon subsequently received orders on 11 December 1862 to report for duty with the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron off Wilmington, North Carolina. Three days later, she began taking on stores at Hampton Roads for delivery to the ships already off Wilmington and apparently arrived later in the month to take up her duties. Extant records indicate that the blockade had been strengthened with additional ships by 29 December -- William Bacon included. Chasing a sail off Wilmington, North Carolina William Bacon operated primarily off Wilmington and the sounds of North Carolina into 1863. Relieving at Little River Inlet on 13 March 1863, she was receiving fresh water from the steamer on 21 March, off the mouth of the Little River, when lookouts sighted a sail to the westward at about 0900. Victoria, Acting Volunteer Lieutenant Edward Hooker commanding, immediately got up steam and gave chase. In accordance with orders from Hooker, William Bacon slipped her anchor chain and made sail. Victoria, the faster of the two Union vessels, managed to close the range in the fog and mist prevailing offshore that morning and lobbed a few shots at the stranger, all of which fell close aboard. While William Bacon came up rapidly, the unidentified vessel hove around and stood toward the two blockaders; Acting Master Rogers, commanding William Bacon, later reported : > And as we did not know but what there might be some resistance, every man > was at the gun ready for immediate action. The prize, English steamer Nicolai I, is captured While William Bacon thus stood by in a posture of readiness, Victoria lowered a boat. Soon, the blockaders learned the identity of the strange ship: she was the English steamer Nicolai I, bound from Nassau, New Providence, in the Bahamas, for Charleston, South Carolina, with a cargo of dry goods, arms, and ammunition. Victoria consequently took her prize into custody and took her up to the main body of the fleet. William Bacon soon returned to the drudgery of coastal patrols. Final operations, decommissioning and sale Records are not clear as to what the ship did next, but it may be presumed that she served in a support capacity for the duration of the Civil War. Ultimately decommissioned at the Washington Navy Yard on 17 June 1865, William Bacon was sold at auction to William L. Wall and Co., on 20 July of the same year.

They number from one hundred to one hundred and fifty, and are sited as two main groups: * one ileocolic group lying close to the wall of the small intestine, among the terminal twigs of the superior mesenteric artery; * a second larger mesocolic group placed in relation to the loops and primary branches of the vessels. Ileocolic lymph nodes The ileocolic lymph nodes, from ten to twenty in number, form a chain around the ileocolic artery, but tend to subdivide into two groups, one near the duodenum and the other on the lower part of the trunk of the artery. Where the vessel divides into its terminal branches the chain is broken up into several groups: * (a) ileal, in relation to the ileal branch of the artery; * (b) anterior ileocolic, usually of three glands, in the ileocolic fold, near the wall of the cecum; * (c) posterior ileocolic, mostly placed in the angle between the ileum and the colon, but partly lying behind the cecum at its junction with the ascending colon; * (d) a single gland, between the layers of the mesenteriole of the appendix; * (e) right colic, along the medial side of the ascending colon. Mesocolic lymph nodes The mesocolic lymph nodes are numerous, and lie between the layers of the transverse mesocolon, in close relation to the transverse colon; they are best developed in the neighborhood of the right and left colic flexures. One or two small glands are occasionally seen along the trunk of the right colic artery and others are found in relation to the trunk and branches of the middle colic artery.

The WCIP had observer status in the United Nations, a secretariat based in Canada and represented over 60,000,000 Indigenous peoples worldwide. The council dealt with the economic, cultural, political, and social rights of indigenous peoples, along with the retention of their land and natural resources. Before dissolving in 1996 the WCIP was a powerful force for indigenous peoples, giving its members a concrete experience in international politics.  Indigenous Rights  The WCIP was built upon the shared history of Indigenous peoples around the world. The WCIP believes that indigenous peoples have experienced a shared history of intimidation, threat, deprivation, injustice, discrimination and genocide, and have felt themselves threatened by extinction. They seek rights to self-determination and self- government, as the WCIP believes that colonialism has rendered them vulnerable to domination and control by more powerful nations and peoples.Transnational Corporations and Their Effect on the Resources and Lands of Indigenous Peoples The WCIP was the first global effort established by indigenous peoples to preserve and protect the group integrity of aboriginal and indigenous peoples worldwide. They regard the \\"preservation and protection of Indigenous interests essential to the preservation of world peace and world development.\\"  Formation  George Manuel, President of the National Indian Brotherhood and member of the Shuswap Tribe of British Columbia, had travelled with Jean Chr√©tien to New Zealand. Upon his return, Manuel said: \\"I hope that the common history and shared values that we discovered in each other are only the seeds from which some kind of lasting framework can grow for a common alliance of Native Peoples.\\" In 1972 Manuel, along with the General Assembly of the National Indian Brotherhood (NIB) endorsed the idea of an international conference of indigenous peoples. It also authorized the NIB to apply for Non- Governmental Organization (NGO) status at the UN. The first preparatory meeting for the world conference was held from April 8 - 11th in Guyana 1974. It included representatives from Australia, Canada, Columbia, Greenland, Guyana, New Zealand, Norway and the United States. They developed a social and political definition of \\"indigenous people\\" which stated: \\"The term indigenous people refers to people living in countries which have a population composed of differing ethnic or racial groups who are descendants of the earliest populations living in the area and who do not as a group control the national government of the countries within which they live.\\" In May 1974 the NIB was granted NGO status by the Economic and Social Council of the UN, based on the fact that there was not yet another international organization of indigenous peoples in existence. The NIB was thus supposed to transfer its NGO status to an international organization should one form.  The Conference  The final international conference was held in Port Alberni, British Columbia, from October 27 - 31st, 1975. It was hosted by the Sheshaht Band of the Nuu-chah- nulth people on reserve land. Representatives were present from the following countries: Argentina, Australia, Bolivia, Canada, Colombia, Ecuador, Finland, Greenland, Guatemala, Mexico, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Norway, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Sweden, the United States and Venezuela. There were 260 participants, 135 observers, 25 members of the press and 54 staff members present. Each country wore its traditional garb and showed cultural pride through song, dance and ceremony. The delegates were scheduled to attend 5 workshops, each pertaining to important indigenous issues: # representation at the United Nations # the Charter of the World Council of Indigenous Peoples # social, economic and political justice # retention of cultural identity # retention of land and natural resources. The final days of the Conference elected George Manuel as chairman, Sam Deloria of the US as secretary general, and also elected a board of representatives. Finally, the conference resolved to prepare a study of the problems of discrimination against Indigenous peoples, and decided that the WCIP would take over the NGO status of the NIB.  Support  Financial support for the WCIP came from Canada, Guyana, Norway and Denmark. Funds also came from the World Council of Churches, the International Work Group for Indigenous Affairs, the United Nations Association of Denmark, and many others.  Key Issues  Transnational Corporations The WCIP holds transnational corporations responsible for the deprivation of Indigenous Nations of their self-determination - control over their own future. They are regarded as the most serious and immediate threat to the survival of the Indigenous Nations of the Fourth World. Land Rights The WCIP believes that the traditional land rights of Indigenous peoples worldwide have been overpowered by the domination of Colonial powers and that indigenous people no longer have the supreme and absolute power over their territories, resources or lives and have been forced to accept the Colonizer's imposed concepts of Indian Rights. In order to rectify this injustice, the WCIP has recommended the following: # that the International community recognize Indigenous sovereignty and entitlement to traditional lands # that the UN recognize the treaties that Indigenous Nations around the world have signed as binding under International Law. # that the International community and the UN honour its responsibility to the Indigenous Nations of the world by establishing the necessary mechanisms and instruments to protect their rights to self-determination with their lands and resources.  Dissolution  Though it made much progress for the rights of Indigenous peoples and groups, the WCIP dissolved in 1996 due to internal conflict.

On 26 September that year, she collided with the battleship at Lerwick, suffering hull damage including a hole in her side below the waterline, rudder damage, and the loss of her sternwalk. She suffered another mishap on 23 July 1906, when she grounded off Lundy Island during unsuccessful operations to salvage the battleship . Duncan transferred to the Atlantic Fleet in February 1907, and underwent a refit at Gibraltar from November to February 1908. In July, Duncan visited Canada during the Quebec Tercentenary, in company with her sister ships , , and . On 1 December, Duncan transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet to serve as Second Flagship. She underwent a refit at Malta in 1909. Under a fleet reorganisation on 1 May 1912, the Mediterranean Fleet became the 4th Battle Squadron, Home Fleet, and changed its base from Malta to Gibraltar; Duncan thus became a unit of the squadron at Gibraltar. On 27 May 1913, Duncan recommissioned at Chatham with a nucleus crew and was assigned to the 6th Battle Squadron in the Second Fleet at Portsmouth, where she served as a gunnery training ship in the commissioned reserve. She began a refit at Chatham in May 1914. World War I HMS Duncan in 1914 Duncan was still undergoing her refit when World War I began in August 1914. Plans originally called for Duncan and battleships , , , , , and to form the 6th Battle Squadron in wartime and serve in the Channel Fleet, where the squadron was to patrol the English Channel and cover the movement of the British Expeditionary Force to France. However, plans also existed for the 6th Battle Squadron to be assigned to the Grand Fleet, and, when the war began, the Commander-in-Chief, Grand Fleet, Admiral Sir John Jellicoe, requested that Duncan and her four surviving sister ships (Albemarle, Cornwallis, Exmouth, and Russell) be assigned to the 3rd Battle Squadron in the Grand Fleet for patrol duties to make up for the Grand Fleet's shortage of cruisers. Accordingly, the 6th Battle Squadron was temporarily abolished, and, upon completion of her refit in September 1914, Duncan joined the 3rd Battle Squadron at Scapa Flow, where she joined the Grand Fleet's cruisers on duty in the Northern Patrol. Duncan and her four sisters, as well as the battleships of the , were temporarily transferred to the Channel Fleet on 2 November 1914 to reinforce that fleet in the face of Imperial German Navy activity in the Channel Fleet's area. The following day, the German fleet raided Yarmouth; at the time, Duncan and the rest of the 3rd Squadron were dispersed on the Northern Patrol, and were thus unavailable during the German attack. On 13 November 1914, the King Edward VII-class ships returned to the Grand Fleet, but Duncan and her sister ships stayed in the Channel Fleet, where they reconstituted the 6th Battle Squadron on 14 November 1914. This squadron was given a mission of bombarding German submarine bases on the coast of Belgium, and was based at Portland, although it transferred to Dover immediately on 14 November 1914. However, due a lack of antisubmarine defenses at Dover, particularly after the harbour's anti-submarine boom was swept away in a gale, the squadron returned to Portland on 19 November 1914. The 6th Battle Squadron returned to Dover in December 1914, then transferred to Sheerness on 30 December 1914 to relieve the 5th Battle Squadron there in guarding against a German invasion of the United Kingdom. Between January and May 1915, the 6th Battle Squadron was dispersed. Duncan left the squadron in February 1915 to be reduced to reserve for a refit at Chatham that lasted until July 1915. She recommissioned at Chatham on 19 July 1915 and was attached to the 9th Cruiser Squadron on the Finisterre-Azores-Madeira Station. In August 1915, Duncan transferred to the 2nd Detached Squadron in the Adriatic Sea. The squadron had been organized in May 1915 to reinforce the Italian Navy against the Austro- Hungarian Navy after Italy declared war on Austria-Hungary. Duncan was based at Taranto, Italy, during this service. Admiral Paolo Thaon di Revel, the Italian naval chief of staff, believed that the threat from Austro-Hungarian submarines and naval mines in the narrow waters of the Adriatic was too serious for him to use the fleet for active operations. Instead, Revel decided to implement a blockade at the relatively safer southern end of the Adriatic with the main fleet, while smaller vessels, such as the MAS boats, conducted raids on Austro-Hungarian ships and installations. In June 1916, Duncan transferred to the 3rd Detached Squadron in the Aegean Sea, based at Salonika. At the time, Greece was ruled by the pro-German Constantine I, who had decided to remain neutral. The Entente powers had landed troops in Salonika in 1915, which was a source of tension between France and Greece. The issue came to a head in August 1916 when a pro-Entente group launched a coup against the monarchy in the Noemvriana. Starting in December 1916, she participated in operations against the Greek royalists, beginning with the landing of Royal Marines at Athens on 1 December 1916 to coerce Constantine to abdicate. The British and French troops were defeated by the Greek Army and armed civilians and were forced to withdraw to their ships, after which the British and French fleet imposed a blockade of the royalist-controlled parts of the country. She returned to the Adriatic Squadron in January 1917. In February, Duncan returned to the United Kingdom and paid off at Sheerness to provide crews for antisubmarine vessels. She was in reserve at Sheerness until April, when she moved to Chatham for a refit. Upon completion of her refit in January 1918, she remained in reserve at Chatham, serving as an accommodation ship. Duncan was placed on the disposal list in March 1919, and was sold for scrapping to Stanlee Shipbreaking Company Limited, in Dover, on 18 February 1920. She was towed to Dover for scrapping in June 1920.

It bears some external resemblance to the BMP-3, particularly with regards to its turret and main armament; however, the chassis and internal subsystems possesses a different layout. The earliest prototypes received the designation ZBD-97.http://www.armystar.com/m/view.php?aid=28544 An improved version, ZBD-04A, is the vehicle currently in service and being produced.http://politics.people.com.cn/n/2015/0903/c398090-27543439.html Overview A ZBD-04 IFV during China's 60th anniversary military parade. The ZBD-04 was designed as the successor to the Type 86 and has been in service with the PLA ground forces since 2006, in the armored units of the Guangzhou and Nanjing military regions. Besides the infantry fighting vehicle (IFV) variant, an armored recovery vehicle (ARV) variant is also available. A further improved variant is known as the ZBD-04A. Design The ZBD-04 has a crew of three (a commander, a driver, and a gunner) and is able to carry seven troops. The commander and gunner are seated in the two-man turret located in the middle, and the driver with one passenger is located in tandem to the left of the power compartment, located at the front right. Six infantrymen are located in the troop compartment at the rear. There are firing ports in the left, right, and exit door that allow infantrymen to fire assault rifles or light machine guns from inside the vehicle, even on the move. The vehicle has amphibious capability, designed to swim to shore from a ship. For high-speed swimming, it has two large water jet ports. Armament The ZBD-04 turret. Front view of the ZBD-04A turret, featuring weapons from left to right including 30mm coaxial automatic cannon, 100mm rifled gun and 7.62mm coaxial machine gun. The Commander's Independent Thermal Viewer (CITV), gunner thermal sight, emergency daylight sight as well as laser warning receivers can be seen mounted on top of the turret. The main armament of the ZBD-04 is a two plane stabilised, semi-automatic 100mm rifled gun, capable of firing both HE-FRAG rounds and the 3UBK10 ATGM. Effective range of the HE-FRAG round is estimated to be 4,000m, with a rate of fire of 10 rounds/minute. The 3UBK10 ATGM consists of a laser beamriding missile and a container case. As well as engaging armoured vehicles and fortifications, the missile could also engage low-flying helicopters. The missile has a maximum range of 4,000m, and can penetrate 600mm of armour. The system carries eight missiles inside the turret. The ZBD-04A also has a coaxial 30mm automatic cannon, with 500 rounds. The cannon can fire both armour-piercing (AP) and HE-FRAG rounds. Rate of fire is 300 rounds/min and range is 1,500 to 2,000m. Like the BMP-3, the ZBD-97 also has a 7.62mm coaxial machine gun located to the left of the main gun. It can also be equipped with four HJ-8 wire-guided anti-tank missiles on both sides of the turret. Protection The ZBD-04 is believed to be fitted with a collective NBC protection system, with its air filter located behind the turret to the right. There is a three-barrel smoke grenade launcher mounted on either side of the turret. The vehicle is fitted with an indigenous-made laser warning and countermeasures system. While ballistic protection is unknown, it is likely that the vehicle has all-round protection against 14.5 mm rounds and resistance against 20-25 mm shells over the frontal arc. Observation and Fire-Control The gunner has a day/night thermal scope and an emergency back-up day sight. Fire-control system includes a ballistic computer, an electro-mechanical gun stabilizer, and a laser rangefinder. The driver‚Äôs hatch mounts three periscopes, with the central periscope being able to be replaced by an image intensifying night vision periscope. On the original ZBD-04, The commander has a day sight and an image-intensifying night sight. On the ZBD-04A, commander has been upgraded to an independent thermal sight that can rotate 360 degrees.

Built to counter a group of fast Russian battleships, Exmouth and her sister ships were capable of steaming at , making them the fastest battleships in the world. The Duncan-class battleships were armed with a main battery of four guns and they were broadly similar to the s, though of a slightly reduced displacement and thinner armour layout. As such, they reflected a development of the lighter second-class ships of the . Exmouth was laid down by Laird Brothers at Birkenhead in August 1899, launched in August 1901, and completed in May 1903. Exmouth served as a flagship for various fleets including the Mediterranean Fleet, the Channel Fleet and the Atlantic Fleet from her commissioning in 1903 until the start of the First World War in 1914. Originally she was to join the 6th Battle Squadron and serve in the Channel Fleet, but this squadron was temporarily disbanded and she joined the 3rd Battle Squadron at Scapa Flow. Exmouth participated in the Northern Patrol and was then moved to the newly reformed 6th Squadron in late 1914, where she bombarded the German-occupied port at Zeebrugge in late November. In mid-1915, the ship was transferred to the Dardanelles campaign, where she supported operations ashore. She was thereafter moved to Greece and later to the East Indies Station starting in March 1917. She performed convoy escort duties in the Indian Ocean between Colombo and Bombay before returning to the United Kingdom, calling at The Cape and Sierra Leone. She arrived at Devonport in August 1917, and paid off to provide crews for antisubmarine vessels. Exmouth remained in reserve at Devonport until April 1919, and was used as an accommodation ship beginning in January 1918. She was placed on the sale list in April 1919 and sold for scrapping to Forth Shipbreaking Company on 15 January 1920. Design Right elevation and deck plan as depicted in Brassey's Naval Annual 1915 The six ships of the were ordered in response to the Russian s that had been launched in 1898. The Russian ships were fast second-class battleships, so William Henry White, the British Director of Naval Construction, designed the Duncan class to match the purported top speed of the Russian vessels. To achieve the higher speed while keeping displacement from growing, White was forced to reduce the ships' armour protection significantly, effectively making the ships enlarged and improved versions of the s of 1896, rather than derivatives of the more powerful , , and series of first-class battleships. The Duncans proved to be disappointments in service, owing to their reduced defensive characteristics, though they were still markedly superior to the Peresvets they had been built to counter. Exmouth was long overall, with a beam of and a draft of . The Duncan-class battleships displaced normally and up to fully loaded. Her crew numbered 720 officers and ratings. The Duncan-class ships were powered by a pair of 4-cylinder triple-expansion engines that drove two screws, with steam provided by twenty-four Belleville boilers. The boilers were trunked into two funnels located amidships. The Duncan-class ships had a top speed of from . This made Exmouth and her sisters the fastest battleships in the world for several years. At a cruising speed of , the ship could steam for . Exmouth had a main battery of four 40-calibre guns mounted in twin-gun turrets fore and aft. The ships also mounted a secondary battery of twelve 45-calibre guns mounted in casemates, in addition to ten 12-pounder guns and six 3-pounder guns for defence against torpedo boats. As was customary for battleships of the period, she was also equipped with four torpedo tubes submerged in the hull. Exmouth had an armoured belt that was thick; the transverse bulkhead on the aft end of the belt was thick. Her main battery turrets' sides were thick, atop barbettes, and the casemate battery was protected with 6 in of Krupp steel. Her conning tower had 12-inch-thick sides. She was fitted with two armoured decks, thick, respectively. Service history Pre-World War I HMS Exmouth was laid down by Laird Brothers at Birkenhead on 10 August 1899. She was floated out on 31 August 1901, when she was named by Lady Alice Stanley, wife of Lord Stanley, Financial Secretary to the War Office, who afterwards gave a speech. She arrived at the Nore in May 1902, and was armed and completed for sea at Chatham Dockyard. After delays due to labour problems, she was completed in May 1903. Exmouth commissioned at Chatham Dockyard on 2 June 1903 for service in the Mediterranean Fleet. She returned to the United Kingdom in May 1904, and on 18 May 1904 recommissioned as Flagship, Vice Admiral, Home Fleet, serving as flagship of Sir Arthur Wilson. When the Home Fleet was redesignated as the Channel Fleet, she continued to serve as the fleet flagship. She transferred her flag in April 1907, was reduced to a nucleus crew, and entered the commissioned reserve to begin a refit at Portsmouth Dockyard. Her refit complete, she recommissioned on 25 May 1907 to serve as Flagship, Vice Admiral, Atlantic Fleet. In July 1908, Exmouth visited Canada during the Quebec Tercentenary, in company with her sister ships , , and . On 20 November 1908 she transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet to serve as flagship there, and underwent a refit at Malta in 1908‚Äì1909. Under a fleet reorganization of 1 May 1912, the Mediterranean Fleet became the 4th Battle Squadron, First Fleet, Home Fleet, and changed its base from Malta to Gibraltar. Exmouth became Flagship, Vice Admiral, Home Fleet, in July 1912. In December 1912, the battleship replaced Exmouth in the 4th Battle Squadron, and Exmouth began a refit at Malta. Upon completion of her refit, Exmouth recommissioned on 1 July 1913 at Devonport Dockyard with a nucleus crew to serve in the commissioned reserve with the 6th Battle Squadron, Second Fleet. She was assigned duties as a gunnery training ship at Devonport. World War I When World War I began in August 1914, plans originally called for Exmouth and the battleships , Albemarle, , Duncan, Russell, and to combine in the 6th Battle Squadron and serve in the Channel Fleet, where the squadron was to patrol the English Channel and cover the movement of the British Expeditionary Force to France. However, plans also existed for the 6th Battle Squadron to be assigned to the Grand Fleet, and, when the war began, the Commander-in-Chief, Grand Fleet, Admiral Sir John Jellicoe, requested that Exmouth and her four surviving sister ships of the Duncan class (Albemarle, Cornwallis, Duncan, and Russell) be assigned to the 3rd Battle Squadron in the Grand Fleet for patrol duties to make up for the Grand Fleet's shortage of cruisers. Accordingly, the 6th Battle Squadron was abolished temporarily, and Exmouth joined the 3rd Battle Squadron at Scapa Flow on 8 August 1914. Exmouth, Russel, and Albemarle were the only ships in a condition to immediately join Jellicoe, so they left without the rest of the squadron on 5 August. They arrived in Scapa Flow on the night of 7‚Äì8 August. Exmouth worked with the Grand Fleet's cruisers on the Northern Patrol. In October, Exmouth went to Devonport for refit. When the Grand Fleet dreadnought battleship struck a mine north of Ireland on 27 October, Exmouth, which was moored in Lough Swilly, was sent to tow her to safety. By the time she arrived, however, Audacious had to be abandoned, and she shortly thereafter capsized and exploded. Exmouth and her four Duncan-class sisters, as well as the battleships of the , temporarily were transferred to the Channel Fleet on 2 November 1914 to reinforce that fleet in the face of Imperial German Navy activity in the Channel Fleet's area. The following day, the German fleet raided Yarmouth; at the time, Exmouth and the rest of the 3rd Squadron were dispersed on the Northern Patrol, and were thus unavailable during the German attack. On 13 November 1914, the King Edward VII-class ships returned to the Grand Fleet, but Exmouth and the other Duncans stayed in the Channel Fleet, where they reconstituted the 6th Battle Squadron on 14 November 1914. This squadron was given a mission of bombarding German submarine bases on the coast of Belgium, and was based at Portland, although it transferred to Dover immediately on 14 November 1914. However, due a lack of antisubmarine defenses at Dover, particularly after the harbour's anti-submarine boom was swept away in a gale, the squadron returned to Portland on 19 November 1914. Exmouth and Russell bombarded Zeebrugge, which was used by German submarines on passage from their base at Bruges, on 23 November 1914, The two ships left Portland on 21 November accompanied by eight destroyers, a group of trawlers, and a pair of airships to observe the fall of shot, though the airships failed to arrive in time for the operation. Exmouth and Russell closed to of the port and shelled the harbour, the railroad station, and coastal defences. The two ships fired some 400 shells in total and observed several fires ashore; reports from Dutch observers indicated significant damage had been inflicted, but the attack achieved very little and discouraged the Royal Navy from continuing such bombardments. The 6th Battle Squadron returned to Dover in December 1914, then transferred to Sheerness on 30 December 1914 to relieve the 5th Battle Squadron there in guarding against a German invasion of the United Kingdom. =Dardanelles campaign= Exmouth moored at Kephalo in 1915 Between January and May 1915, the 6th Battle Squadron was dispersed. Exmouth left the squadron when she transferred to the Dardanelles on 12 May 1915 for service in the Dardanelles Campaign as Flagship, Rear Admiral, supporting squadron, flying the flag of Rear Admiral Nicholson. She steamed to the Mediterranean with the battleship ; the British hoped to take advantage of the experience both ships' crews had gained in bombarding coastal positions in Belgium. She was fitted with extra-heavy anti-torpedo nets for this service. After the torpedoing and sinking of battleships , , and , all within the space of two weeks in May 1915, she was the only battleship allowed to remain off the Gallipoli Peninsula beaches at Kephalo on the island of Imbros. This was a result of her heavy anti-torpedo nets, which were believed made it safer for her to remain on station than any of the other battleships. On 4 June, Exmouth, the battleship , and the protected cruiser went to Cape Helles to support an Allied attack on the Turkish-held heights at Achi Baba. Reports of enemy submarines in the area forced the ships to steam in circles to avoid being targeted, which reduced their accuracy. The ground forces were unable to break through the Ottoman lines, so the attack was called off. By July, the anchorage at Kephalo had received an anti-submarine boom, which improved the security of Exmouths station. She supported another Allied attack on the Ottoman positions at Achi Baba in August, which also failed. =Later operations= Exmouth left the Dardanelles in November 1915 and transferred to the Aegean Sea to become Flagship, 3rd Detached Squadron, a force based at Salonika that had been organized to assist the French Navy in blockading the Aegean coast of Greece and Bulgaria and to reinforce the Suez Canal Patrol. On 28 November 1915, she took aboard personnel of the British Belgrade Naval Force as they were being evacuated from Serbia. From September to December 1916 she served in the Allied force supporting Allied demands against the government of Greece, which at the time was ruled by the pro-German Constantine I, who had decided to remain neutral at the outbreak of war. In August 1916, a pro-Allied group launched a coup against the monarchy in the Noemvriana, which the Allies sought to support. Exmouth participated in the seizure of the Greek fleet at Salamis and landed Royal Marines at Athens on 1 December 1916. The British and French troops were defeated by the Greek Army and armed civilians and were forced to withdraw to their ships, after which the British and French fleet imposed a blockade of the royalist-controlled parts of the country. Exmouth transferred to the East Indies Station in March 1917, where she performed convoy escort duties in the Indian Ocean between Colombo and Bombay. In June 1917, she ended this service to return to the United Kingdom, calling at Zanzibar, The Cape and Sierra Leone during the voyage. She arrived at Devonport in August 1917, and paid off to provide crews for antisubmarine vessels. Exmouth remained in reserve at Devonport until April 1919, and was used as an accommodation ship beginning in January 1918. Exmouth was placed on the sale list in April 1919 and sold for scrapping to Forth Shipbreaking Company on 15 January 1920. Her hull was scrapped in the Netherlands.

It is located on the Willamette River, and is the western landing for the Buena Vista Ferry. It is approximately 6 miles south-southeast of Independence. History right Buena Vista was named in about 1850 by Reason B. Hall, who settled on a Donation Land Claim there in 1847. Some of Hall's relatives had participated in the Battle of Buena Vista during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. About the same time he named the community, Hall also started Halls Ferry across the Willamette. The ferry later became known as the Buena Vista Ferry, which is still in operation today. Later one of Hall's sons, B.F. Hall, operated another Halls Ferry north of Independence. Buena Vista was once the home of a pottery factory that shipped its wares all over Oregon via the Willamette River. One of the earliest settlements in Oregon, it once had a much greater population because of the pottery industry, as well as being an important hops-growing area. Buena Vista had saloons, a hotel, a school, a church, an I.O.O.F. hall and a store. The town later went into decline, especially because the railroad bypassed Buena Vista and instead was routed through Independence. Today, most of the principal buildings are gone and the community is considered a ghost town by authors of ghost town guidebooks, although local residents tend to disagree. Buena Vista formerly had a post office by the same name. The post office ran from 1866 to 1935.

Design for a hand woodblock printed textile, showing the complexity of the blocks used to make repeating patterns in the later 19th century. Tulip and Willow by William Morris, 1873. Woodblock printing on textiles is the process of printing patterns on textiles, usually of linen, cotton or silk, by means of incised wooden blocks. It is the earliest, simplest and slowest of all methods of textile printing. Block printing by hand is a slow process. It is, however, capable of yielding highly artistic results, some of which are unobtainable by any other method. History Origins Woodblock, India, about 1900 Printing patterns on textiles is so closely related in its ornamental effects to other different methods of similar intention, such as by painting and by processes of dyeing and weaving, that it is almost impossible to determine from the picturesque indications afforded by ancient records and writings of pre-Christian, classical or even medieval times, how far, if at all, allusion is being made in them to this particular process. Hence its original invention must probably remain a matter of inference only. As a process, the employment of which has been immensely developed and modified in Europe in the nineteenth century by machinery anti the adoption of stereotypes and engraved metal plates, it is doubtless traceable to a primeval use of blocks of stone, wood, etc., so cut or carved as to make impressions on surfaces of any material; and where the existence of these can be traced in ancient civilizations, e.g. of China, Egypt and Assyria, there is a probability that printing ornament upon textiles may have been practiced at a very early period. Nevertheless, highly skilled as the Chinese are, and for ages have been, in ornamental weaving and other branches of textile art, there seem to be no direct evidences of their having resorted so extensively to printing for the decoration of textiles as peoples in the East Indies, those, for instance, of the Punjab and Bombay, from whose posterity 16th-century European and especially Dutch merchants bought goods for Occidental trade in Indiennes or printed and painted calicoes. Ancient world As in, the case of weaving and embroideries, specimens of printed stuffs have of recent years been obtained from disused cemeteries in Upper Egypt (Akhmim and elsewhere) and tell us of Egypto-Roman use of such things. Some few of them are now lodged in European museums. For indications that earlier Egyptians, Greeks and Romans were likely to have been acquainted with the process, one has to rely upon less certain evidence. Of textiles painted by Egyptians there are many actual examples. Apart from these there are wall paintings, e.g., those of Beni Hasan (c. 2200-1800 BC) which depict Egyptian people wearing costumes irregularly patterned with spots, stripes and zigzags, which may have been more easily stamped than embroidered or woven. A rather more complicated and orderly pattern well suited to stamping occurs in a painting about 1320 BC, of Hathor and King Meneptha I. Herodotus, referring to the garments of inhabitants of the Caucasus, says that representations of various animals were dyed into them so as to be irremovable by washing. When Alexander invaded India in 327 BC, there were reportedly block-printed textiles produced there. Pliny the Elder describes a very remarkable process employed in Egypt for the colouring of cloth. After pressing the material, which is white at first, they saturate it, not with colours, but with mordants that are calculated to absorb colour. He does not explain how this saturation is done. But as it is clearly for the purpose of obtaining a decorative effect, stamping or brushing the mordants into the material may be inferred. When this was finished the cloth was plunged into a cauldron of boiling dye and removed the next moment fully coloured. It is a singular fact, too, that although the dye in the pan is of one uniform colour, the material when taken out of it is of various colours according to the nature of the mordants that have been respectively applied to it. Egypto-Roman bits of printed textiles from Akhmim exhibit the use, some three hundred years later than the time of Pliny, of boldly cut blocks for stamping figure- subjects and patterns onto textiles. Almost concurrent with their discovery was that of a fragment of printed cotton at Arles in the grave of St Caesarius, who was bishop there about AD 542. Equal in archaeological value are similar fragments found in an ancient tomb at Quedlinburg. These, however, are of comparatively simple patterns. Medieval Europe Museum specimens establish the fact that more important pattern printing on textiles had become a developed industry in parts of Europe towards the end of the 12th and the beginning of the 13th century. According to Forrer (Die Kunst des Zeugdrucks, 1898) medieval Rhenish monasteries were the cradles of the artistic craft of ornamental stamp or block cutting, although it is now recognised that some of the examples he relied on are modern forgeries. In rare monastic manuscripts earlier in date than the 13th century, initial letters (especially those that recurred frequently) were sometimes stamped from hand-cut blocks; and German deeds of the 14th century bear names of block cutters and textile stampers as those of witnesses. Amongst the more ancient relics of Rhenish printed textiles are some of thin silken stuff, impressed with patterns in gold and silver foil. Of these, and of a considerable number of later variously dyed stout linens with patterns printed in dark tones or in black, specimens have been collected from reliquaries, tombs and old churches. The first written reference to printed textiles in Europe is found in Florentine trade regulations from the fifteenth century. In 1437, Cennino Cennini published a treatise describing the technique. Early modern Europe Augsburg, famous in the 17th century for its printing on linens, etc., supplied Alsace and Switzerland with many craftsmen in this process. After the revocation of the edict of Nantes, French refugees took part in starting manufactories of both painted and printed cloths in Holland, England and Switzerland; some few of the refugees were allowed back into France to do the same in Normandy: manufactories were also set up in Paris, Marseilles, Nantes and Angers; but there was still greater activity at Geneva, Neuchtel, Zurich, St Gall and Basel. The first textile printing works in Great Britain are said to have been begun towards the end of the 17th century by a Frenchman on the banks of the Thames near Richmond, and soon afterwards a more considerable factory was established at Bromley Hall in Essex; many others were opened in Surrey early in the 18th century. At Muihouse the enterprise of Koechlin, Schmatzer and Dollfus in 1746, as well as that of Oberkampf at Jouy, led to a still wider spread of the industry in Alsace. In almost every place in Europe where it was taken up and followed, it was met by local and national prohibitions or trade protective regulations and acts, which, however, were gradually overcome. Technique Textile fragment, 24 cm x 21 cm, made circa 1545 - 1645 AD. Produced in India for export, found in Fustat, Egypt. The brown colored pattern is formed by the use of a mordant applied to the ground cloth with a single stamp. The red dye was then painted on. The outline of the square block, forming four quarter circles with the star shape in the middle, is faintly visible. Preparing the block Woodblocks for textile printing may be made of box, lime, holly, sycamore, plane or pear wood, the latter three being most generally employed. They vary in size considerably, but must always be between two and three inches thick, otherwise they are liable to warping, which is additionally guarded against by backing the wood chosen with two or more pieces of cheaper wood, such as deal or pine. The several pieces or blocks are tongued and grooved to fit each other, and are then securely glued together, under pressure, into one solid block with the grain of each alternate piece running in a different direction. The block, being planed quite smooth and perfectly flat, next has the design drawn upon, or transferred to it. This latter is effected by rubbing off, upon its flat surface, a tracing in lampblack and oil, of the outlines of the masses of the design. The portions to be left in relief are then tinted, between their outlines, an ammoniacal carmine or magenta, for the purpose of distinguishing them from those portions that have to be cut away. As a separate block is required for each distinct colour in the design, a separate tracing must be made of each and transferred (or put on as it a termed) to its own special block. Having thus received a tracing of the pattern the block is thoroughly damped and kept in this condition by being covered with wet cloths during the whole process of cutting. The blockcutter commences by carving out the wood around the heavier masses first, leaving the finer and more delicate work until the last so as to avoid any risk of injuring it during the cutting of the coarser parts. When large masses of colour occur in a pattern, the corresponding parts on the block are usually cut in outline, the object being filled in between the outlines with felt, which not only absorbs the colour better, but gives a much more even impression than it is possible to obtain with a large surface of wood. When finished, the block presents the appearance of flat relief carving, the design standing out like letterpress type. Fine details are very difficult to cut in wood, and, even when successfully cut, wear down very rapidly or break off in printing. They are therefore almost invariably built up in strips of brass or copper, bent to shape and driven edgewise into the flat surface of the block. This method is known as coppering, and by its means many delicate little forms, such as stars, rosettes and fine spots can be printed, which would otherwise be quite impossible to produce by hand or machine block printing. Frequently, too, the process of coppering is used for the purpose of making a mold, from which an entire block can be made and duplicated as often as desired, by casting. In this case the metal strips are driven to a predetermined depth into the face of a piece of lime-wood cut across the grain, and, when the whole design is completed in this way, the block is placed, metal face downwards in a tray of molten type-metal or solder, which transmits sufficient heat to the inserted portions of the strips of copper to enable them to carbonize the wood immediately in contact with them and, at the same time, firmly attaches itself to the outstanding portions. When cold a slight tap with a hammer on the back of the limewood block easily detaches the cake of the type-metal or alloy and along with it, of course, the strips of copper to which it is firmly soldered, leaving a matrix, or mold, in wood of the original design. The casting is made in an alloy of low melting-point, anti, after cooling, is filed or ground until all its projections are of the same height and perfectly smooth, after which it is screwed onto a wooden support and is ready for printing. Similar molds are also made by burning out the lines of the pattern with a red-hot steel punch, capable of being raised or lowered at will, and under which the block is moved about by hand along the lines of the pattern. Other tools In addition to the engraved block, a printing table and colour sieve are required. The table consists of a stout framework of wood or iron supporting a thick slab of stone varying in size according to the width of cloth to be printed. Over the stone table top a thick piece of woolen printers blanket is tightly stretched to supply the elasticity necessary to give the block every chance of making a good impression on the cloth. At one end, the table is provided with a couple of iron brackets to carry the roll of cloth to be printed and, at the other, a series of guide rollers, extending to the ceiling, are arranged for the purpose of suspending and drying the newly printed goods. The colour sieve consists of a tub (known as the swimming tub) half filled with starch paste, On the surface of which floats a frame covered at the bottom with a tightly stretched piece Of mackintosh or oiled calico. On this the colour sieve proper, a frame similar to, the last but covered with fine woolen cloth, is placed, and forms when in position a sort of elastic colour trough over the bottom of which the colour is spread evenly with a brush. Printing process Woman doing Block Printing at Halasur village, Karnataka, India. The printer commences by drawing a length of cloth, from the roll, over the table, and marks it with a piece of coloured chalk and a ruler to indicate where the first impression of the block is to be applied. She then applies the block in two different directions to the colour on the sieve and finally presses it firmly and steadily on the cloth, ensuring a good impression by striking it smartly on the back with a wooden mallet. The second impression is made in the same way, the printer taking care to see that it fits exactly to the first, a point which he can make sure of by means of the pins with which the blocks are provided at each corner and which are arranged in such a way that when those at the right side or at the top of the block fall upon those at the left side or the bottom of the previous impression the two printings join up exactly and continue the pattern without a break. Each succeeding impression is made in precisely the same manner until the length of cloth on the table is fully printed. When this is done it is wound over the drying rollers, thus bringing forward a fresh length to be treated similarly. If the pattern contains several colours the cloth is usually first printed throughout with one, then dried, re-wound and printed with the second, the same operations being repeated until all the colours are printed. Many modifications of block printing have been tried from time to time, but of these only two tobying and rainbowing are of any practical value. The object of tobey printing is to print the several colours of a multicolour pattern at one operation and for this purpose a block with the whole of the pattern cut upon it, and a specially constructed colour sieve are employed. The sieve consists of a thick block of wood, on one side of which a series of compartments are hollowed out, corresponding roughly in shape, size and position to the various objects cut on the block. The tops of the dividing walls of these compartments are then coated with melted pitch, and a piece of fine woolen cloth is stretched over the whole and pressed well down on the pitch so as to adhere firmly to the top of each wall; finally a piece of string soaked in pitch is cemented over the woolen cloth along the lines of the dividing walls, and after boring a hole through the bottom of each compartment the sieve is ready for use. In operation each compartment is filled with its special colour through a pipe connecting it with a colour box situated at the side of the sieve and a little above it, so as to exert just sufficient pressure on the colour to force it gently through the woolen cloth, but not enough to cause it to overflow its proper limits, formed by the pitch- soaked string boundary lines. The block is then carefully pressed on the sieve, and, as the different parts of its pattern fall on different parts of the sieve, each takes up a certain colour that it transfers to the cloth in the usual way. By this method of tobying from two to six colours may be printed at one operation, but it is only applicable to patterns where the different coloured objects are placed at some small distance apart, and that, therefore, it is of but limited application.

Like all ships of the class (apart from the lead ship of the class, ) she was named after an important part of the British Empire, namely the Dominion of Canada. The ship was built by Vickers; she was laid down in May 1902, was launched in August 1903, and was completed in July 1905. Armed with a battery of four and four guns, she and her sister ships marked a significant advance in offensive power compared to earlier British battleship designs that did not carry the 9.2 in guns. Commissioned in August 1905, Dominion entered service with the Atlantic Fleet but ran she aground in August 1906 in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence. Repairs took nearly a year, and upon completion, she was assigned to the Home Fleet. Following a reorganisation of the fleet in 1912, she and her sister ships formed the 3rd Battle Squadron, part of the Home Fleet. That year, the squadron went to the Mediterranean Sea during the First Balkan War as part of an international blockade of Montenegro. In 1913, the ship returned to British waters. When the First World War broke out, the 3rd Battle Squadron was assigned to the Grand Fleet, with Dominion conducting operations as part of the Northern Patrol. Through 1914 and 1915, the ships frequently went to sea to search for German vessels, but Britannia saw no action during this period. By the end of the year, the Grand Fleet stopped operating with the older 3rd Battle Squadron ships, and in 1916, the squadron was detached to the Nore Command. The unit subsequently dissolved in March 1918. She was a depot ship for the raids on Zeebrugge and Ostend, and, decommissioned in May, ended the war as an accommodation ship. She was sold in 1921 and eventually scrapped in 1924. Design Left elevation and deck plan as depicted in Jane's Fighting Ships Following the development of pre-dreadnought type battleships carrying heavy secondary guns of diameter in the Italian Regia Marina and the United States Navy, the Royal Navy decided to build similar ships. Initial proposals called for a battleship equipped with eight guns to support the main battery, though under the direction of William Henry White, the Director of Naval Construction, these were replaced with four guns. The new ships, though based on the general type that had formed the basis of the preceding four battleship designs, marked the first significant change in the series. Like all late pre- dreadnoughts that entered service in the mid-1900s, Dominion was made almost instantaneously obsolescent by the commissioning of the all-big-gun in December 1906, armed with a battery of ten heavy guns compared to the typical four of most pre-dreadnoughts. Dominion was long overall, with a beam of and a draft of . The King Edward VII-class battleships displaced normally and up to fully loaded. Her crew numbered 777 officers and ratings. The King Edward VII- class ships were powered by a pair of 4-cylinder triple-expansion engines that drove two screws, with steam provided by sixteen water-tube boilers. The boilers were trunked into two funnels located amidships. The King Edward VII- class ships had a top speed of from . Dominion had a main battery of four 40-calibre guns mounted in twin-gun turrets fore and aft. These were supported by a heavy secondary battery of four guns in four single turrets, two on each broadside. The ships also mounted ten 45-calibre guns mounted in casemates, in addition to fourteen 12-pounder guns and fourteen 3-pounder guns for defence against torpedo boats. As was customary for battleships of the period, she was also equipped with five torpedo tubes submerged in the hull; two were on each broadside, with the fifth in the stern. Dominion had an armoured belt that was thick; the transverse bulkheads on the aft end of the belt was thick. The sides of her main battery turrets were also 8 to 12 in thick, atop 12 in barbettes, and the 9.2 turrets had sides. The casemate battery was protected with of armour plate. Her conning tower had 12-inch-thick sides. She was fitted with two armoured decks, thick, respectively. Service history Early career HMS Dominion was ordered under the 1902 Naval Estimates. She was laid down at Vickers' yards at Barrow-in-Furness on 23 May 1902, her first keel plate placed by Lord Walter Kerr, First Sea Lord. She was launched on 25 August 1903, began trials in May 1905 and was completed in July 1905. Dominion commissioned on 15 August at Portsmouth Dockyard for service in the Atlantic Fleet. She ran aground in the Gulf of St. Lawrence on 16 August 1906, suffering severe damage to her hull plating and some flooding. She arrived at Bermuda for temporary repairs in September; when these were completed in January 1907, she moved to Chatham Dockyard for completion of her repairs beginning in February. While out of service at Chatham, she transferred to the Channel Fleet in March. Her repairs were completed in June and she was recommissioned for her Channel Fleet service. Under a fleet reorganization on 24 March 1909, the Channel Fleet became the 2nd Division, Home Fleet, and Dominion became a Home Fleet unit in that division. Under a fleet reorganization in May 1912, Dominion and all seven of her sisters (, , , , , , and ) were assigned to form the 3rd Battle Squadron, assigned to the First Fleet, Home Fleet, although Dominion was initially attached to the 2nd Battle Squadron and did not join the 3rd Battle Squadron until June 1912. The squadron was detached to the Mediterranean in November because of the First Balkan War (October 1912 ‚Äì May 1913); it arrived at Malta on 27 November and subsequently participated in a blockade by an international force of Montenegro and in an occupation of Scutari. The squadron returned to the United Kingdom in 1913 and rejoined the Home Fleet on 27 June. World War I Upon the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914, the 3rd Battle Squadron, at the time under the command of Vice Admiral Edward Bradford, was assigned to the Grand Fleet and based at Rosyth, where it was reinforced with the five s, It was used to supplement the Grand Fleet's cruisers on the Northern Patrol. On 6 August, the day after Britain declared war on Germany, elements of the Grand Fleet sortied to inspect the coast of Norway in search of a German naval base violating Norwegian neutrality. Dominion and the rest of the 3rd Battle Squadron provided distant support to the operation. No such base was found, and the ships returned to port the next day. On 14 August, the ships of the Grand Fleet went to sea for battle practice before conducting a sweep into the North Sea later that day and into 15 August. During sweeps by the fleet, she and her sisters often steamed at the heads of divisions of the far more valuable dreadnoughts, where they could protect the dreadnoughts by watching for mines or by being the first to strike them. On 25 August, Dominion reported that two of her 12-inch guns had cracked, though the squadron flagship, King Edward VII, had the same problem, so the squadron commander transferred his flag to Dominion while his flagship was away for repairs. King Edward VII returned on 1 September and resumed her role as flagship, allowing Dominion to leave to have her guns replaced in Devonport. On 2 November 1914, the squadron was detached to reinforce the Channel Fleet and was rebased at Portland. It returned to the Grand Fleet on 13 November 1914. Map of the North Sea On 14 December, the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron, 2nd Battle Squadron, and accompanying cruisers and destroyers left port to intercept the German forces preparing to raid Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby. On the first reports of contact with German units on the morning of 16 December, the Grand Fleet commander, Admiral John Jellicoe, ordered Bradford to take the 3rd Battle Squadron to support the ships in contact at 10:00. Four hours later, they met the 1st and 4th Battle Squadrons, en route from Scapa Flow, though they failed to reach the German High Seas Fleet before the latter withdrew. The Grand Fleet remained at sea until late on 17 December, at which point the 3rd Battle Squadron was ordered back to Rosyth. Dominion and the rest of the squadron joined the Grand Fleet for another sweep into the North Sea on 25 December. The fleet returned to its ports two days later, having failed to locate any German vessels. The 3rd Battle Squadron went to sea on 12 January 1915 for gunnery training, steaming north and passing to the west of Orkney on the night of 13‚Äì14 January. After completing training on the 14th, they returned to Rosyth on 15 January. On 23 January, the 1st and 2nd Battlecruiser Squadrons sortied to ambush the German I Scouting Group in what resulted in the Battle of Dogger Bank the following day. Later on the 23rd, the rest of the Grand Fleet, including Dominion, sortied to support the battlecruisers. The 3rd Squadron ships left first and steamed at full speed to reach ships of the Harwich Force, which had reported contact with German vessels. The battlecruisers intervened first, and Dominion and her sisters arrived around 14:00, by which time the battlecruisers had sunk the armoured cruiser and the surviving German ships had fled. The 3rd Battle Squadron patrolled the area with the rest of the Grand Fleet over the night before being detached at 08:00 on 25 January to steam to Rosyth. Elements of the Grand Fleet went to sea repeatedly over the next few months. The 3rd Battle Squadron patrolled the central North Sea in company with the 3rd Cruiser Squadron from 10 to 13 March. The two units again went to sea to sweep the central North Sea from 5 to 8 April. A major fleet operation followed on 11 April, with the entire Grand Fleet sortieing for a sweep of the North Sea on 12 and 13 April. The squadrons returned to their ports on 14 April to replenish their fuel. Another such operation followed on 17 April, which also failed to find any German ships. The 3rd Battle Squadron returned to Rosyth late on 18 April. The fleet sortied again on 21 April, returning to port two days later. The 3rd Battle Squadron, joined by the 3rd Cruiser Squadron, patrolled the northern North Sea from 5 to 10 May, during which a German U-boat attacked the battleships; the U-boat had launched a pair of torpedoes at Dominion but failed to score a hit. Another sweep into the North Sea took place on 17‚Äì19 May, and no German forces were encountered. The fleet went to sea again on 29 May for a patrol south to the Dogger Bank before returning to port on 31 May, again without having located any German vessels. The Grand Fleet spent much of June in port conducting training, but the most modern units went to sea on 11 June for gunnery practice to the northwest of Shetland. While they were training, Dominion and the rest of the 3rd Battle Squadron, along with the 3rd Cruiser Squadron, patrolled the central North Sea. Fleet activities were limited in July, owing to a threatened strike by coal miners, which began on 18 July and threatened the supply of coal for the fleet's ships. The strike continued into August, which led Jellicoe to continue to limit fleet activities to preserve his stocks of coal. The fleet saw little activity in September, and during this period, the Grand Fleet began to go to sea without the older ships of the 3rd Battle Squadron. On 29 April 1916, the 3rd Battle Squadron was rebased at Sheerness, and on 3 May 1916 it was separated from the Grand Fleet, being transferred to the Nore Command. Dominion remained there with the squadron until March 1918, being attacked unsuccessfully by a German submarine in May 1916 and undergoing a refit at Portsmouth Dockyard in June 1917. The units of the 3rd Battle Squadron had begun to disperse gradually in 1916, and by 1 March 1918, Dominion and battleship were the only ships left in the squadron. The squadron was finally dissolved in March 1918, and Dominion paid off to serve as a barracks ship for the Zeebrugge Raid and the First Ostend Raid; she joined Hindustan and was used to house the crews for the ships involved in the operations while the men trained. She served in this capacity, stationed in the Swin, until early May. On 2 May, Dominion was transferred into the Nore Reserve. She was employed as an accommodation ship. On 29 May 1919, Dominion was placed on the disposal list at Chatham Dockyard. She was sold for scrapping on 9 May 1921 to Thos W Ward. On 30 September 1923 she was towed to Belfast to be stripped, and she arrived at Preston for scrapping on 28 October 1924.

Description  The Silverwater Bridge opened on 10 November 1962, and was the first concrete box girder bridge built in New South Wales. It was the first of the two major bridges needed to construct the Hornsby-Heathcote county road (the other being the Alfords Point Bridge), and was the second project undertaken in the construction of this county road (the first being Olympic Drive Lidcombe, between Boorea and Church Streets, in 1959). In conjunction with the construction of the bridge, Silverwater Road between Parramatta Road and the bridge was widened to six lanes, and was extended across the new bridge to connect to Victoria Road at Ermington. The origin of the suburb's name, and subsequently the bridge's name, is unknown.

Under a fleet reorganisation on 24 March 1909, the Channel Fleet became the 2nd Division, Home Fleet, and New Zealand became a Home Fleet unit in that division. To release her name for use by the new battlecruiser , which had been presented to the Royal Navy by the government of New Zealand, it became necessary to rename New Zealand in 1911. At first the name Caledonia, the Roman name for Scotland, was favoured, but this met opposition in New Zealand. Eventually, the name Zealandia, a personification of New Zealand, was agreed upon, and the ship was renamed Zealandia on 1 December 1911.

World War I =With the Grand Fleet= Map of the North Sea Upon the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914, the 3rd Battle Squadron, at the time under the command of Vice Admiral Edward Bradford, was assigned to the Grand Fleet and based at Rosyth, where it was reinforced with the five s, It was used to supplement the Grand Fleet's cruisers on the Northern Patrol. On 6 August, the day after Britain declared war on Germany, elements of the Grand Fleet sortied to inspect the coast of Norway in search of a German naval base violating Norwegian neutrality. Zealandia and the rest of the 3rd Battle Squadron provided distant support to the operation. No such base was found, and the ships returned to port the next day. On 14 August, the ships of the Grand Fleet went to sea for battle practice before conducting a sweep into the North Sea later that day and into 15 August. During sweeps by the fleet, she and her sisters often steamed at the heads of divisions of the far more valuable dreadnoughts, where they could protect the dreadnoughts by watching for mines or by being the first to strike them. On 2 November 1914, the squadron was detached to reinforce the Channel Fleet and was rebased at Portland. It returned to the Grand Fleet on 13 November 1914. On 14 December, the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron, 2nd Battle Squadron, and accompanying cruisers and destroyers left port to intercept the German forces preparing to raid Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby. On the first reports of contact with German units on the morning of 16 December, the Grand Fleet commander, Admiral John Jellicoe, ordered Bradford to take the 3rd Battle Squadron to support the ships in contact at 10:00. Four hours later, they met the 1st and 4th Battle Squadrons, en route from Scapa Flow, though they failed to reach the German High Seas Fleet before the latter withdrew. The Grand Fleet remained at sea until late on 17 December, at which point the 3rd Battle Squadron was ordered back to Rosyth. Zealandia and the rest of the squadron joined the Grand Fleet for another sweep into the North Sea on 25 December. The fleet returned to its ports two days later, having failed to locate any German vessels. The 3rd Battle Squadron went to sea on 12 January 1915 for gunnery training, steaming north and passing to the west of Orkney on the night of 13‚Äì14 January. After completing training on the 14th, they returned to Rosyth on 15 January. On 23 January, the 1st and 2nd Battlecruiser Squadrons sortied to ambush the German I Scouting Group in what resulted in the Battle of Dogger Bank the following day. Later on the 23rd, the rest of the Grand Fleet, including Zealandia, sortied to support the battlecruisers. The 3rd Squadron ships left first and steamed at full speed to reach ships of the Harwich Force, which had reported contact with German vessels. The battlecruisers intervened first, and Zealandia and her sisters arrived around 14:00, by which time the battlecruisers had sunk the armoured cruiser and the surviving German ships had fled. The 3rd Battle Squadron patrolled the area with the rest of the Grand Fleet over the night before being detached at 08:00 on 25 January to steam to Rosyth. Elements of the Grand Fleet went to sea repeatedly over the next few months. The 3rd Battle Squadron patrolled the central North Sea in company with the 3rd Cruiser Squadron from 10 to 13 March. The two units again went to sea to sweep the central North Sea from 5 to 8 April. A major fleet operation followed on 11 April, with the entire Grand Fleet sortieing for a sweep of the North Sea on 12 and 13 April. The squadrons returned to their ports on 14 April to replenish their fuel. Another such operation followed on 17 April, which also failed to find any German ships. The 3rd Battle Squadron returned to Rosyth late on 18 April. The fleet sortied again on 21 April, returning to port two days later. The 3rd Battle Squadron, joined by the 3rd Cruiser Squadron, patrolled the northern North Sea from 5 to 10 May, during which a German U-boat attacked the battleships but failed to score a hit. Another sweep into the North Sea took place on 17‚Äì19 May, and no German forces were encountered. The fleet went to sea again on 29 May for a patrol south to the Dogger Bank before returning to port on 31 May, again without having located any German vessels. The Grand Fleet spent much of June in port conducting training, but the most modern units went to sea on 11 June for gunnery practice to the northwest of Shetland. While they were training, Zealandia and the rest of the 3rd Battle Squadron, along with the 3rd Cruiser Squadron, patrolled the central North Sea. Fleet activities were limited in July, owing to a threatened strike by coal miners, which began on 18 July and threatened the supply of coal for the fleet's ships. The strike continued into August, which led Jellicoe to continue to limit fleet activities to preserve his stocks of coal. The fleet saw little activity in September, and during this period, the Grand Fleet began to go to sea without the older ships of the 3rd Battle Squadron. =Later operations= On 6 November 1915, a division of the 3rd Battle Squadron, consisting of the battleships Zealandia, Hibernia (the flagship), , and , was detached from the Grand Fleet to serve in the Gallipoli Campaign. Albemarle had to return for repairs, assisted by Hibernia and accompanied by Zealandia, after suffering severe damage in heavy seas on the first night of the outbound voyage. Zealandia incurred damage to her gun ports, which also necessitated repairs. After work on Zealandia was completed, she, Russell, and Hibernia pressed on and arrived at the Dardanelles on 14 December 1915. In late January 1916, Zealandia and Hibernia left the eastern Mediterranean to return to the United Kingdom, arriving at Portsmouth Dockyard on 6 February 1916. Zealandia underwent a refit there that lasted until March 1916, after which the ship rejoined the 3rd Battle Squadron and the Grand Fleet on 26 March 1916. On 29 April 1916, the 3rd Battle Squadron was rebased at Sheerness, and on 3 May 1916 it was separated from the Grand Fleet, being transferred to the Nore Command. Zealandia remained there with the squadron until September 1917, undergoing a refit at Chatham Dockyard from December 1916 to June 1917, which saw the 6-inch guns removed from their casemate mounts, four of which were re-mounted in shielded pivot mounts where the 12-pounder guns had been located on the upper deck. On 20 September 1917, Zealandia left the 3rd Battle Squadron and paid off into reserve at Portsmouth Dockyard. While in reserve, she was refitted between January and September 1918 for use as a gunnery training ship, receiving much of the upgraded fire control equipment that her sister ship Commonwealth did, although not torpedo bulges. She also received a pair of 3-inch anti-aircraft guns. Although she never recommissioned or entered service as a gunnery training ship, she was included in many experiments, including the use of various types of fire control equipment. She was used as an accommodation ship at Portsmouth beginning in 1919. Zealandia was placed on the disposal list on 2 June 1919, and on 8 November 1921 she was sold for scrapping to Stanlee Shipbreaking Company. She was resold to Slough Trading Company, then resold again to German scrappers, and left Portsmouth on 23 November 1923 for scrapping in Germany.

Hong Kong. 24 April 2019 Trial at West Kowloon Court On 9 April 2019, at West Kowloon Court, Chan and eight others were found guilty of public nuisance and incitement over their roles in the 2014 Hong Kong protests. Earlier, Chan scheduled a full-body health check- up to reassure her mother that she was physically ready to endure a jail term if this were to happen. Her physical examination was conducted in a private hospital on 4 April. Chan received the results of her health check on 11 April, followed by a consultation in Canossa Hospital on 17 April. The test results revealed there was something unclear with her brain. On 18 April, Dr Edmund Woo Kin-wai, a neurologist, found that Tanya Chan had a meningioma, a type of brain tumour larger than a ping-pong ball. The tumour was considered dangerous as it pressed on Chan's brain stem, nerves, and blood vessels. On 23 April, medics stated that Chan needed open brain surgery to remove the tumour as soon as possible, followed by radiotherapy sessions. According to medics, there was no clarity whether the tumour was caused by cancer, and an open brain surgery would be necessary for additional medical insights. On 24 April, the trial at West Kowloon Court adjourned her sentencing to 10 June, since Chan required brain surgery within two weeks. The other eight Occupy Central leaders were sentenced to different punishments, ranging from 200 hours community service to 16 months of jail time. In the same day, Chan asked Legislative Council president Andrew Leung for leave from her legislative duties while she sought further treatment. Before speaking about her illness, she also asked Hongkongers to continue their fight for democracy and to believe in their faith. On 10 June 2019, Chan was handed a sentence of eight months suspended for two years, after the court was told that she would require radiotherapy treatment and will experience double vision for six months. Her brain tumour was found to be benign, but had not been completely removed, and needed further therapy. The court was also asked to consider her record of public service since 2006.

Dry Town Water Park is a water park operated by the city of Palmdale, California, opened in 2006. It is located on the grounds of the Palmdale Oasis Park & Recreation Center in the southeast portion of the city. It is open each year from the Memorial Day weekend in May through Labor Day in September. The park features six water slides, a toddler water fun zone with three slides and water play devices, a lazy river, as well as various swimming pools and a dining area.  Attractions  The six acre park features four main attractions. A tower structure that holds three serpentine style slides accompanied by a three foot deep ‚Äúcatch pool‚Äù. A second tower structure that holds four individual slides accompanied with a runout at the end. An aqua play zone designed for kids accompanied with three more slides and zero- depth area with a giant bucket that can splash dozens of people. Lastly, the park offers a 725-foot lazy river that winds around the center of the park, making it the park's largest attraction.  Tower A  The first tower was part of the parks original blueprint, which opened in 2006. The tower features three slides that are individually colored and named. Rattler's Revenge, also known as the ‚Äúred slide‚Äù to locals, is a half-covered half-open slide that requires riders who are 48‚Äù or higher to ride on a designated flotation device. Each rider is required be seated with their bottoms on the inner rim of the tube with their legs rested outward and hands gripped on the handle. During the duration of the ride, riders are asked and required to remain seated while also not twisting or turning at any point during the ride. The tower's second slide, The Wildcatter or the ‚Äúyellow slide‚Äù, is the only slide of the three that is entirely open. Like the red slide, riders must ride properly on a designated tube during the length of the ride. The tower's third slide, the Devil's Punch Bowl or the ‚Äúblue slide‚Äù, is the most unique of the three. Like its name, the blue slide is a giant bowl that each rider drops into and then swirls in a giant bowl. Some riders can get up to four times around before finally entering another drop into the catch pool. Rattler's Revenge, The Wildcatter, The Devil's Punchbowl. Individual guests can enjoy these rides as long as they meet the height and weight requirements. A pair of guests can also enjoy the ride as the park does offer and equip double rider tubes. Guests can enjoy the thrill these slides have to offer with whomever they like, as long as the heavier rider sits in the back and the smaller rider in the front, per safety regulations.  Tower B  The second tower is unique in which it was not part of the original opening of the park in 2006. This attraction, known as Dusty's Mine Shaft Racer, broke ground after the 2011's summer season and became fully operational for the 2012 summer season. Guests 42‚Äù or higher may be allowed to ride the ride and is favored among those who seek thrill. The rider rides down head first on their stomach with legs up and feet crossed on a mat equipped with handles. The duration of the ride includes turns and fast speeds. The ride also has four individuals slides and although neither of them are specifically named, they each are identified by a different color. Dusty's Mine Shaft Racer.  Little Miner's Camp  This attraction is for guests 36‚Äù or higher. It features a levitated platform with three slides, water shooters, and buckets, all surrounded by water less than a foot. This attraction is especially popular within toddlers, ages 3‚Äì5. A giant bucket that drops hundreds of gallons of water on guests is located on the east side of the attraction.  The Lazy River  The Big Rock River, also known as The Lazy River, is a 725-foot river makes this the largest attraction in the entire park. The river contains three main entrances and exits that guests are welcome to enter in. Guests 48‚Äù or higher are welcome to use to the river without the presence of another adult. Guests are able to use inflatable tubes that are located throughout the river on a first-come, first- served basis with no extra fee. This attraction can contain and up to one thousand guests, as dozens of jets propel the river in one motion, making the river fast.  Operation   Employees  Since its debut in 2006, Dry Town has employed hundreds of workers within the Antelope Valley. Zoning from Quartz Hill to Littlerock, California. A range of different age groups have been employed for the park with teenagers from ages 16 to 18 years old being the most prominent.  Grounds staff  The grounds staff or, Program Leaders, are available at each guests discretion for assistance and inquiries regarding park rules, and hours of operation. These program leaders are stationed around the park ‚Äì each entrance/exit of the lazy river, Little Miner's Camp, both slide towers, and the food pavilion ‚Äì for assistance on each designated area. For example, if a guest is in need of a flotation tube of their choice, an available program leader will be able to assist them in handing that guest a tube and or fulfilling any desire they might have to the best of their ability.  Office staff  In contrast to the grounds staff, the office staff help with the park internally. These positions include - admissions, and front gate and bag checking. Other duties that these staff members might endure are money handling, organizing and planning events, answering customer phone calls, season pass inquiries, and handle customer walk-ins.  Lifeguards  The City of Palmdale hires a staff of about 65 people designated to work at the park for the entire summer season. Most of the hired employees go through a lifeguard academy where the skills of becoming a lifeguard are taught along with first aid and CPR. Once a recipient passes the class, they are guaranteed an interview with the city and from there wait to see if they are selected. Once selected, the new employee will be assigned to Dry Town and will start to train vigorously in the weeks prior to opening day. The lifeguard staff train by practicing with equipment and running park wide scenarios in order to ensure the best possible rescues and service. The lifeguard staff is responsible for enforcing rules at each of the attractions throughout the park. Everyday of operation there are 24 lifeguards stationed at their designated positions and are ‚Äúscanning‚Äù open bodies of water, and dispatching riders down slides. While scanning, each guard must meet a time mark in order to abide by the park's standards and ensure the best safety. In a position where a lifeguard is dispatching riders, the guard must provide the rules in appliance with the height and weight standards. Once those rules are given the guard must make sure the exit of the slide is clear in order to give the okay for the rider to go down. There is a first aid room located just right of the entrance that is available for any guest that needs assistance. This may include heat illness, bee stings, cuts and scrapes, and bloody noses. A lifeguard will be there at all times to assist with the patrons needs depending on the situation.  Temperature and inclement weather  Due to the region in which the park is located, the high desert, the park is subject to various types of weather. Starting in June, temperatures range from 90 to 95 each day. By mid July until August, temperatures can reach 100 to 105 each day. This heat is in fact detrimental to the park's guests and employees. The lifeguards and grounds staff take a bigger toll since they are out in the dry heat with no shade and are not submerged in water. However, each staff member is encouraged to look out for their coworker ensuring they take breaks and consume adequate amounts of water in order to avoid heat illness or heat stroke. As opposed to typical heat and heat waves, Dry Town is susceptible to stormy weather at times. When temperatures drop and precipitation rises, the park becomes trapped in a thunderstorm. If lightning is present, the park must close immediately and guests who are in or near water must exit and leave the park as soon as possible. Palmdale is also susceptible to high winds, making working conditions very difficult. Although the park may not close due to high winds certain areas and attractions may be shut off for the time being in order to avoid park damage or injury to staff members or guests. Unfortunately Palmdale may be subject to fires and or in the way of surrounding fires resulting in heavy smoke affecting the quality of air. Heavy smoke makes it dangerous for guests and employees to breathe the contaminated air and the visibility becomes poor. Depending on the severity of the smoke, the park may close due to bad air quality.  Social impact   Communal significance  The City of Palmdale prides itself in having a family centered water park for residents and people from all over the Antelope Valley to enjoy. Since the water park is located on a main street, many surrounding neighborhoods are within walking distance to the water park. Within those neighborhoods come schools where hundreds of grade school kids come for end of the year field trips. Just 45 miles south of Dry Town is its biggest competitor, Hurricane Harbor. A lot of Dry Town's guests save a trip and instead enjoy a day in their local community water park. Guests save on money with Dry Town's reasonable admission prices and wait times for rides. In an area where the median household income is $52,423, families can enjoy themselves economically while still being close to home.  Lifeguard and staff recognition  During the training process, each lifeguard is certified in order to work at the water park. At least two times a season, a representative from the company that certifies the lifeguards comes out and performs an evaluation on their scan times, and appearance. At the end of the session the representative calculates the scores after a full days observation and determines an overall score. A score of 70 or higher is considered a world class score nationwide. Any score below a 40 follows an immediate closure of the park. In 2012, Dry Town received a perfect score of 100, deeming themselves world class lifeguards. Since then, the water park has received scores in the mid and high 90's still crowning the world class lifeguard title. Dry Town has also received many awards regarding service and work recognition.

People share knowledge through many channels such as conversations, meetings, learning sessions, workshops, videos and other communication media. Organizations have recognized that knowledge constitutes a valuable intangible asset for creating and sustaining competitive advantages. Knowledge sharing activities are generally supported by knowledge management systems. However, technology constitutes only one of the many factors that affect the sharing of knowledge in organizations, such as organizational culture, trust, and incentives. The sharing of knowledge constitutes a major challenge in the field of knowledge management because some employees tend to resist sharing their knowledge with the rest of the organization. In the digital world, websites and applications enable knowledge or talent sharing between individuals and/or within teams. The individuals can easily reach the people who want to learn and share their talent to get rewarded. Knowledge sharing as flow or transfer Although knowledge is commonly treated as an object, Dave Snowden has argued it is more appropriate to teach it as both a flow and a thing. Knowledge as a flow can be related to the concept of tacit knowledge, While the difficulty of sharing knowledge is in transferring knowledge from one entity to another, it may prove profitable for organizations to acknowledge the difficulties of knowledge transfer, adopting new knowledge management strategies accordingly. Knowledge sharing levels Knowledge can be shared in different ways and levels. The following segmentation sheds light on the essence of sharing- Explicit knowledge Explicit knowledge sharing occurs when explicit knowledge is made available to be shared between entities. Explicit knowledge sharing can happen successfully when the following criteria are met: * Articulation: the knowledge provider can describe the information. * Awareness: the recipient must be aware that knowledge is available. * Access: the knowledge recipient can access the knowledge provider. * Guidance: the body of knowledge must be defined and differentiated into different topics or domains so as to avoid information overload, and to provide easy access to appropriate material. Knowledge managers are often considered key figures in the creation of an effective knowledge sharing system. * Completeness: the holistic approach to knowledge sharing in the form of both centrally managed and self-published knowledge. Tacit knowledge Tacit knowledge sharing occurs through different types of socialization. Although tacit knowledge is difficult to identify and codify, relevant factors that influence tacit knowledge sharing include: * Informal networks such as daily interactions between people within a defined environment (work, school, home, etc.). These networks span hierarchies and functions. * The provision of space where people can engage in unstructured or unmonitored discussions, thereby fostering informal networks. * Unstructured, less-structured or experimental work practices that encourage creative problem solving, and the development of social networks. Embedded knowledge Embedded knowledge sharing occurs when knowledge is shared through clearly delineated products, processes, routines, etc. This knowledge can be shared in different ways, such as: * Scenario planning and debriefing: providing a structured space to create possible scenarios, followed by a discussion of what happened, and how it could have been different. * Management training. * Knowledge transfer: deliberately integrating systems, processes, routines, etc., to combine and share relevant knowledge. Importance to organizations In an organizational context, tacit knowledge refers to a kind of knowledge that human beings develop by the experience they gain over years. At present the employees‚Äô experience and knowledge can be seen as the most important and most valuable source that organizations have to protect. Knowledge constitutes a valuable, intangible asset for creating and sustaining competitive advantages within organizations. Several factors affect knowledge sharing in organizations, such as organizational culture, trust, incentives, and technology. Knowledge sharing activities are commonly supported by knowledge management systems, a form of information technology (IT) that facilitates and organizes information within a company or organization. Challenges Knowledge sharing can sometimes constitute a major challenge in the field of knowledge management. The difficulty of knowledge sharing resides in the transference of knowledge from one entity to another. Some employees and team leaders tend to resist sharing their knowledge because of the notion that knowledge is property; ownership, therefore, it becomes very important. Leaders and supervisors tend to hoard information in order to demonstrate power and supremacy over their employees. In order to counteract this, individuals must be reassured that they will receive some type of incentive for what they create. However, Dalkir (2005) demonstrated that individuals are most commonly rewarded for what they know, not what they share. Negative consequences, such as isolation and resistance to ideas, occur when knowledge sharing is impeded. Sometimes the problem is that a part of an employee's knowledge can be subconscious and therefore it may be difficult to share information. To promote knowledge sharing and remove knowledge sharing obstacles, the organizational culture of an entity should encourage discovery and innovation. Members who trust each other are willing to exchange knowledge and at the same time want to embrace knowledge from other members as well.Levin, D.Z. & Cross, R. (2004). The Strength of Weak Ties You Can Trust: The Mediating Role of Trust in Effective Knowledge Transfer. Management Science, Vol. 50, No. 11. National culture is also one of the common barriers of knowledge sharing because culture has an huge effect on how people are tend to share knowledge between each other. In some cultures, people share everything, in other cultures people share when asked, and in some cultures, people don't share even if it would help to achieve common goals. The political scientist H√©l√®ne Hatzfeld has pointed out that people who have knowledge can be reluctant to share that knowledge when they are not confident in their own expertise, so to facilitate knowledge sharing, structures can be designed to elevate everyone to the status of a potential expert and make them more comfortable contributing; one example of such a system, to which Hatzfeld attributes mixed success in this regard, is Wikipedia. Connection to adjacent disciplines Information technology systems Information technology (IT) systems are common tools that help facilitate knowledge sharing and knowledge management. The main role of IT systems is to help people share knowledge through common platforms and electronic storage to help make access simpler, encouraging economic reuse of knowledge. IT systems can provide codification, personalization, electronic repositories for information and can help people locate each other to communicate directly. With appropriate training and education, IT systems can make it easier for organizations to acquire, store or disseminate knowledge. Economic theory In economic theory, knowledge sharing has been studied in the field of industrial organization and in the field of contract theory. In industrial organization, Bhattacharya, Glazer, and Sappington (1992) have emphasized the importance of knowledge sharing in research joint ventures in a context of imperfect competition. In the theory of incomplete contracts, Rosenkranz and Schmitz (1999, 2003) have used the Grossman-Hart-Moore property rights approach to study how knowledge sharing is affected by the underlying ownership structure. Methods There are several methods both formal and informal that have claims to enable knowledge sharing in organisations. These include, but are not limited to: * Communities of Practice: a group of people who share a craft or a profession; usually takes the form of cross organizational or inter-organizational workgroups, in physical, virtual or blended forms Wenger, E. C., & Snyder, W. M. (2000). Communities of practice: The organizational frontier. Harvard business review, 78(1), 139-146. * Communities of Interest: Informal and voluntary gathering of individuals discussing on a regular basis, in many cases through defined digital channelFischer, G. (2001, August). Communities of interest: Learning through the interaction of multiple knowledge systems. In Proceedings of the 24th IRIS Conference (Vol. 1, pp. 1-13). Department of Information Science, Bergen. * Workgroups: Task-oriented groups that may include project teams or employees from various departments, working and sharing knowledge together towards a specific goal such as product development or productionKozlowski, S. W., & Bell, B. S. (2012). Work groups and teams in organizations. Handbook of Psychology, Second Edition, 12. * Knowledge cafe: a methodology to conduct knowledge sharing sessions using a combination of a large assembly and of small discussion groups of 3-5 persons, usually around small tablesGurteen, D. (2015). Knowledge cafe. Inside Knowledge, 13(3), 8-13. * Chats: Informal sharing, using instant messaging platforms. The knowledge is accessible mainly in the present or by search.Stein, D. S., Wanstreet, C. E., Glazer, H. R., Engle, C. L., Harris, R. A., Johnston, S. M., ... & Trinko, L. A. (2007). Creating shared understanding through chats in a community of inquiry. The Internet and Higher Education, 10(2), 103-115. * Wikis: digital spaces to gather and share knowledge on specific topics. While discussion groups and chats are time-based. Wikis are topic-based. Wiki pages and topics link to form an intuitive network of accumulated knowledge. Categories are also used as a means to organize and present topics in wiki pages.Wagner, C. (2004). Wiki: A technology for conversational knowledge management and group collaboration. Communications of the association for information systems, 13(1), 19. * Shared Knowledge Bases: Shared organized content, containing information and knowledge. Can be formed as websites, intranets databases, file drives or any other form that enables the access to content by the various individuals.Levesque, H. J., & Lakemeyer, G. (2001). The logic of knowledge bases. MIT Press. * Expert Maps: Organized lists or network of experts and corresponding expertise.

The work, which was originally dedicated to King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania Sigismund II Augustus, survived only in ten fragments that were first published in 1615 by Johann Jacob Grasser in Basel, Switzerland. Content The treatise is thought to date from around 1550: the author's ideas and writing style show the clear influence of humanism. While the treatise contains some useful historical information, this should be treated with care. The work is neither a chronicle nor a travel book, but rather a political essay which is critical of the author's motherland (Grand Duchy of Lithuania) and overly praises Muscovy and the Crimean Khanate for their centralized governments and united subjects.Introduction to the Russian translation: –ú–∏—Ö–∞–ª–æ–Ω –õ–∏—Ç–≤–∏–Ω. –û –Ω—Ä–∞–≤–∞—Ö —Ç–∞—Ç–∞—Ä, –ª–∏—Ç–æ–≤—Ü–µ–≤ –∏ –º–æ—Å–∫–≤–∏—Ç—è–Ω. Moscow 1994 The author examines the reasons behind Lithuania's decreasing power and influence, criticises the nobility and high Catholic officials, and advocates for a strong centralized government. He further idealizes the era of Vytautas the Great, when the ruling class supposedly did not pursue self-interests, and instead served the state. Michalo supports the theory that the Lithuanian nation was founded by the legendary dynasty of the Palemonids from the late Roman Empire, and he proposes introducing Latin as the Grand Duchy's official language, thereby restoring forgotten ancestral traditions. As proof of the similarity between Lithuanian and Latin, Michalo includes a list of 74 words that are similar in the two languages. He also compares ancient Roman traditions with pagan Lithuanian customs. Author The identity of the author, also known as Michalon Litwin or Michalo the Lithuanian, is not known. In the book's title his name is given in the genitive as \\"Michalonis Lithuani\\". Modern historians, including the Lithuanian Ignas Jonynas and the Russian Matvey Lubavsky, have identified the author as Micha≈Ç Tyszkiewicz, the Lithuanian envoy to the Crimean Tatars in 1537‚Äì39. However, Tyszkiewicz was an Eastern Orthodox while \\"Michalonis Lithuani\\" identified himself as a Catholic. The Polish historian has proposed notary Vatslav Nikolayevich (Vaclovas Mikalojaitis or Wac≈Çaw Niko≈Çajewicz, ‚Äì ) from Mai≈°iagala. Nikolayevich began to serve Grand Chancellor of Lithuania Albertas Go≈°tautas around 1526. In 1528 and from 1534 until his death, he was a secretary at the Grand Duke's Chancery. He was an envoy of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania to Moscow in 1537 and 1555‚Äì1556 and to Crimea in 1543.

Lonelyville has approximately 80 houses and is located between the communities of Dunewood and Atlantique. As on much of Fire Island, cars are generally not permitted in Lonelyville during the summer months and bicycles are the principal means of wheeled transport. The closest ferry service is to Dunewood from Bay Shore on Long Island. There are no stores, cafes, bars, or other facilities in Lonelyville, but it is a fairly easy walk, or bike ride, to Fair Harbor which serves as a town center for the community. The majority of the houses are predominantly summer-only vacation cottages, and consequently there are only a handful of year-round residents. Probably the most famous, past, residents of Lonelyville were Mel Brooks and his wife Anne Bancroft who had an ocean front house there for many years. Brooks purportedly wrote many of his movies and comedy sketches there. Incidentally, the structure was the first project to be designed and built by famed architect, Richard Meierhttp://www.usmodernist.org/meier.htm in 1963.  History  Sketch of early Lonelyville, NY, circa 1908 It is unclear when the first dwelling was built in Lonelyville, but speculation suggest that fishermen may have used the area as a camp site in the late 1890s. By 1908, it appears that three structures had been built in the community by three businessmen and friends from Bay Shore, NY who ‚Äúspend their time in killing ducks ‚Ä¶ catching ‚Äòsuckers‚Äô and other things out in the bay when there is nothing else to do, and between intervals of sleep, dining at the expense of each other and swapping stories‚Äù They three structures were built by ex- Justice of the Peace, Harry M. Brewster -- ‚ÄúBrewster‚Äôs Bungalow‚Äù, ex-cashier of the South Side Bank, Harry S. Raven --‚ÄúRaven‚Äôs Ranch‚Äù and ex-Tax Collector of Bay Shore, Selah T. Clock --‚ÄúClock‚Äôs Castle‚Äù. At one such dinner, Brewster came up with the idea of calling the place ‚ÄúLonelyville‚Äù and ‚Äúwith due √©clat and champagne, the resort was christened and launched upon the sea of fame‚Äù The three presented a set of rules for Lonelyville which they, the only voting members, unanimously adopted. ‚ÄúWe, the undersigned ‚Ä¶ being fully clothed and in our right (questioned) minds, do herby agree that ‚Ä¶. No person or persons not of good moral character shall be permitted to dwell with the city limits.\\" \\"The settlers already established are herby proclaimed exempt from this regulation.‚Äù ‚ÄúNo saloons, dives or gambling resorts shall be permitted within a mile of any church or school house.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Sabbath day shall be strictly observed by every person in sound health taking a bath.\\" \\"There shall be no horse racing, cock fights of firemen‚Äôs tournaments on Sundays.‚Äù and finally ‚ÄúThe board of Aldermen shall be responsible that shall see that the tide rises and falls every day and that the surf continues to roll in.‚Äù By 1909, Captain Ed Thompson of Northport and Brooklyn and an associate of Captain Clock‚Äôs built himself another bungalow ‚Äúa good many miles from the noise of everything but the surf‚Äù Fire Island Estates (Lonelyville); 1915. In June 1915 Captain Clock, along with Thompson, planned to build a 1000-foot pier into the ocean and establish the Fire Island Fishing Company there. The idea of the venture was to unload fish from commercial fishing boats, along with fish caught with the use of large fishing nets which were strung out some 1600 feet from the pier and reeled in daily. The catch would then be loaded onto a small railroad system and then run across the island to another pier extending 500 feet on the bayside. The fish would then be loaded into other boats and then sailed to the mainland. This avoided the long and tricky passage through Fire Island Inlet thus saving countless travel hours for the fishermen. The pier remained standing long after Captain Clock‚Äôs fishing company shut down and became somewhat of a landmark for that part of Fire Island. The Hurricane of 1938 finally took what remained of the slowly deteriorating pier. In a 1915 map from the Hyde, E. Belcher, Map Company of Brooklyn, Lonelyville is also listed as \\"Fire Island Estates\\" and the pier appears to have been in place at that time as well as the railroad track for the Fire Island Fishing Company. The 1938 New England hurricane completely demolished the pier leaving little except the bayside portion of the dock which stood until the 1950s. As recently as August 2008, footings for the pier could be seen about 100 feet off shore and submerged under 20 feet of water .

The foundation is arguably best well known in the Delaware Valley for its charitable giving and general financial support to the Archdiocese of Philadelphia. In 2006, the foundation gave over to Catholic education in the Philadelphia area.  Mission  History John F. Connelly founded The Connelly Foundation in 1955 while maintaining his position as head of Connelly Containers.Connelly became the chairman of the Crown Cork and Seal Company the following year, 1956, a position he held until his death in 1990 at age 85. During his lifetime, Connelly saw the foundation award over $74 million in grants to both religious and secular organizations in education, health and human services and cultural activities. Josephine C. Mandeville, a daughter of the founders, took on the role of President upon Connelly's death in 1990 and held this role until 2018 when Tom Riley succeeded her. Mandeville remained with the Foundation as Chairman. Riley had previously served as vice president for strategic planning for the Foundation since 2012. Activities and programs The Connelly Foundation has awarded over $300 million in grants since its inception in 1955, mostly within the Philadelphia area. The organization maintains a detailed breakdown of to whom grants are awarded on a yearly basis on their website. In 1993, the Foundation enacted a tuition credit program, known as the Josephine C. Connelly Achievement Award and initially amounting to per year for four years, to encourage Philadelphia parochial school students to continue their education in Catholic high schools. To provide perspective, annual Catholic high school tuition for the 1993-1994 school year was . Also in 1993, the Foundation provided grant support to Allentown College for their purchase of Brisson Seminary, required to accommodate expanding enrollment.

The Predators cut Fryzel prior to the 2008 season after he tore his ACL. Previous to signing with Orlando, he played wide receiver with the Miami Dolphins, the Atlanta Falcons, the Tennessee Titans, and the Chicago Bears. High school As a youth, Fryzel attended Lakeland High School in Lakeland, Florida, where he was active in Student Council, National Honor Society, and Fellowship of Christian Athletes, as well as becoming an All-County selection as a junior and senior in football. Fryzel lettered in track and soccer, as well, and served as junior class president. College career From 1999 to 2002, Fryzel played 43 games for the UCF Knights, including starting 23 games in his final two seasons. After establishing career-highs with 58 catches for 1,126 yards and 5 touchdowns, Fryzel obtained Second-Team All-Mid-American Conference Honors as a senior. He also earned a MAC Offensive Player-of-the-Week award for his game against Miami University, in which he caught 6 passes for 174 yards and 2 touchdowns. He finished his collegiate career with 137 receptions for 2,469 yards and 10 touchdowns. Then following his senior year, he played in the Rotary Gridiron Classic All-Star Game. Fryzel earned a bachelor's degree in accounting. NFL career After college, Fryzel began his pro career by signing with the Miami Dolphins as an undrafted free agent in May 2003. Later in 2003, he spent time on the practice squad of the Atlanta Falcons, the Tennessee Titans, and the Chicago Bears. In 2004, he attended the Chicago Bears training camp, but was waived during pre-season, then signed on again to the team's practice squad in October 2004. Early AFL Career On October 14, 2005, Fryzel signed on with the Orlando Predators to a one-year contract. Fryzel compiled big numbers in his first season with the Predators, despite having missed the first four games on the inactive list. Nevertheless, Fryzel led the Predators in receiving yards (1,159), finishing second in receptions (78), as well as second in receiving touchdowns (18). Fryzel also ended the season ranked second on team in both scoring (108 points) and all-purpose yards (1,356). He picked up an Offensive Player-of-the-Game award in his first game for his efforts, which included nine passes for 133 yards and 3 touchdowns versus the Chicago Rush. Fryzel might have complied four touchdowns in that game, but his last was called back when officials ruled the back of his head hit the line in the back-of-end zone on a spectacular leaping catch. After four consecutive 100-yard games, Fryzel earned his second Offensive Player-of-the-Game after his fifth consecutive 100-yard game against arch- rival, Tampa Bay Storm. In which he compiled 10 receptions for a career-high 159 yards and 3 touchdowns. He tied the club record for five consecutive games with at least 100-yards in receiving, but left early in the 3rd quarter with fractured ribs in a game versus Georgia. He missed two games because of the injury, but returned in the regular season finale, posting 170 receiving yards and 12 receptions, both of which were career highs. Fryzel posted 12 receptions for 128 yards and 3 touchdowns in a pair of playoff games, but his season was cut short after a semi-final loss to the Georgia Force. He re- signed with Orlando to another one-year deal in July 2005. 2006 Season Fryzel led the Orlando Predators in receptions (87), receiving yards (1,108) and receiving touchdowns (23) for the 2006 season. He also led club in scoring with 138 total points. Fryzel caught 3 touchdown passes in a single game three times in his first three games. Then in Week 4 against the Tampa Bay Storm, Fryzel compiled 11 receptions for 158 yards and 3 touchdowns. But after Week 4, Fryzel was placed on Injured Reserve after being diagnosed with diabetes. Upon his return, he posted four, 100-yard receiving games during the final games of the regular season. He then caught 18 balls for 222 yards and 4 touchdowns in the post-season, including a game-high 10 receptions against the Chicago Rush in ArenaBowl XX, which the Predators came up short in defeating. Fryzel signed a one-year contract in July, allowing himself to continue to post big numbers with Orlando for the 2007 season. 2007 season In his first week against the Storm, Fryzel led team in receptions, grabbing 10 receptions for 107 yards and one score, in which his play was slightly hampered with a hamstring injury. Jimmy started in the second game, but reinjured his hamstring and his play-time was severely limited. From Week 3 to Week 9, he was sitting on the Injured Reserve list, but he returned in Week 10, catching five passes for 36 yards and one score. The old Fryzel returned the next week versus the New Orleans VooDoo, grabbing nine balls for 105 yards and one touchdown, in which he completed two key grabs on third down to keep the drives alive. In Week 12, Fryzel posted his third 100-yard game of the 2007 season, even completing his second score on the final play of game, producing winning points in a 46-45 come-from-behind win versus Austin. Then in the final game of the Predators 2007 season, he was limited to 39 yards on four catches, but he did manage a key eight-yard touchdown reception on third down at beginning of fourth quarter. In that game, Fryzel experienced his first taste of defense in the AFL, playing safety in the final seconds of the game against New York. Fryzel was also active in Predators off-season community service program, making multiple appearances in schools and charity functions on behalf of the Predators. 2008 season Fryzel tore his ACL prior to the 2008 AFL season. The Orlando Predators then released Fryzel. The current AFL Collective Bargaining Agreement states a team must place a player on IR (injured reserve) if he has been with the team for four seasons. Fryzel had played only three. So, despite being a league-leading receiver, and a fan favorite, the Predators cut him.

It summarizes a longer report or proposal or a group of related reports in such a way that readers can rapidly become acquainted with a large body of material without having to read it all. It usually contains a brief statement of the problem or proposal covered in the major document(s), background information, concise analysis and main conclusions. It is intended as an aid to decision-making by managers and has been described as the most important part of a business plan. An executive summary differs from an abstract in that an abstract will usually be shorter and is typically intended as an overview or orientation rather than being a condensed version of the full document. Abstracts are extensively used in academic research where the concept of the executive summary is not in common usage. \\"An abstract is a brief summarizing statement... read by parties who are trying to decide whether or not to read the main document\\", while \\"an executive summary, unlike an abstract, is a document in miniature that may be read in place of the longer document\\".  Structure  There is general agreement on the structure of an executive summary - books and training courses emphasise similar points. Typically, an executive summary will: * be approximately 5-10% of the length of the main report * be written in language appropriate for the target audience * consist of short, concise paragraphs * begin with a summary * be written in the same order as the main report * only include material present in the main report * make recommendations * provide a justification * have a conclusion * be readable separately from the main report * sometimes summarize more than one document  Importance  Executive summaries are important as a communication tool in both academia and business. For example, members of Texas A&M; University Department of Agricultural Economics observe that \\"An executive summary is an initial interaction between the writers of the report and their target readers: decision makers, potential customers, and/or peers. A business leader‚Äôs decision to continue reading a certain report often depends on the impression the executive summary gives.\\"  Criticisms  It has been said that, by providing an easy digest of an often complex matter, an executive summary can lead policy makers and others to overlook important issues. Prof. Amanda Sinclair of the University of Melbourne has argued that this is often an active rather than a passive process. In one study, centred on globalization, she found that policy makers face \\"pressures to adopt a simple reading of complex issues\\" and \\"to depoliticise and universalize all sorts of differences\\". She claims that \\"all research was framed under pre-defined and generic headings, such as business case points. The partners' reports were supposed to look the same. The standardization of research occurred via vehicles such as executive summaries: 'executives only read the summaries' we were told\\". Similarly Colin Leys, writing in The Socialist Register, argues that executive summaries are used to present dumbed down arguments: \\"there is remarkably little adverse comment on the steep decline that has occurred since 1980 in the quality of government policy documents, whose level of argumentation and use of evidence is all too often inversely related to the quality of their presentation (in the style of corporate reports, complete with executive summaries and flashy graphics).\\"  See also  *Business plan presentation formats *Introduction (writing)  References   External links  * An executive summary of a major report by an international body*Dead LinkAn executive summary published by the US Department of State Business documents ","title":"Executive summary"},{"id":"14371981","text":"The National Institute of Astrophysics, Optics and Electronics (in Spanish: Instituto Nacional de Astrof√≠sica, √ìptica y Electr√≥nica, INAOE) is a Mexican science research institute located in Tonantzintla, Puebla.

It stands in the R√≠o Papaloapan basin, at the 83rd kilometer of the Veracruz‚ÄìTierra Blanca railroad. History of El J√≠caro El Jicaro was founded around the 1920s on land that belonged to Don Joaqu√≠n Fernandez Mora, the offspring of large land owners ruined by the Mexican Revolution which began in 1910 and lasted for almost two decades. Given the country's political and economic situation of the time, everyone, including land owners like Don Joaqu√≠n, entered the conflict, mainly to defend themselves. In the latter part of the 1920s, the country's situation began to change and a relative calm ensued. A friend and revolutionary comrade of Don Joaqu√≠n's (a.k.a. \\"el perro negro\\"), Pedro Moreno asked him for a plot of land to build a house for his family. Pedro Moreno built his house near the railroad that in those days did not have a stop in the area, where there were only the houses of Don Joaqu√≠n and Pedro Moreno. One day the train stopped near the quasi hamlet at the 83rd kilometer, to get water for the locomotive, which had run dry. They went up to Don Pedro's home to get water and they asked him what the place was called. He said it had no name. The engine driver told him to make one up. A little startled, for he had never thought of naming the place, Don Pedro looked around him for an idea to name the place. Suddenly he spotted a \\"chomo\\" tree full of green and round fruit, the size of a bowling ball, which is some kind of gourd, whose dry shell is used as a vessel and kitchen utensil. He said let's call it \\"El Jicaro\\", which is what the gourds are called in the local vernacular. From then on the place was known as \\"El Jicaro\\". Eventually a cantina called el \\"chomito\\" run by a famous character named \\"Zapotito\\" would open up near the site of the famous \\"chomo\\" tree. The railway company built a station and soon people flocked from nearby areas to board the train up to the Port of Veracruz and the bigger town of Tierra Blanca. Pedro Moreno left the village never to be heard of again. But Don Joaqu√≠n remained in El J√≠caro where he built his little empire, in spite of being left penniless by the Mexican Revolution and the agrarian reform; Don Joaqu√≠n lost the greater part of his land which covered a great expanse of the district (around 2000+ hectares). Most of the land was partitioned into communal land (ejido) and settled by many farmers, mostly of the Delgado and Aguirre clans. The communal land settlers made small lots near the railway where they had put the sign with the name of \\"El J√≠caro km 83\\", and so a small village began to grow. Don Joaqu√≠n was left with the lands at the center of J√≠caro extending from the San Pablo river to the Estanzuela river. This area of Mexico being of tropical and torrid climate, has only two seasons, the dry season and the rainy season. Don Joaquin kept two homes, one in town next to the railroad which he used for shipping the goods he produced in his ranches such as cotton, maize, charcoal, cheese and livestock. In the dry season the \\"finca\\" of \\"El Jobito\\" in \\"Paso 'e la Gloria\\" (his second abode near the Estanzuela river) was more appropriate for cattle grazing, so he would move the cattle ranching operations to this side of his property, approximately 8 km away, when the grasses in El Jicaro started to dry up. Don Joaqu√≠n gave land in the center of town for an elementary school, a municipal agency and introduced electricity. Later, his son Reyes(R.I.P.) donated land for both a kindergarten and the senior high school. As time went by Don Joaquin became the richest man in the village. He was the owner of a general store in the middle of the little town which served as the main area for commerce and social events. He died in the 1970s, of a heart attack while visiting his longtime mistress Amada Amador. Many of his descendants still live in the village. In the 1980s, Clemente Moreno (Don Pedro's eldest son) went to El J√≠caro to buy a house where he would retire. It is from him that we learned the anecdotal origin of this village's name. Today, El Jicaro has drinkable water, sewer service, phone service, internet and a paved road. The railway has been made redundant as nobody travels or uses the train for transporting goods. The population of El Jicaro has been greatly diminished by the migration of its young people to other parts of the country and the United States. \\"Efforts\\" have been made by the local governments to create jobs. The most recent attempt was a projected ethanol distillery for use as an alternative fuel made from the abundant sugar cane in the area, but apparently it was cancelled. Most people say it was an all too common ploy to persuade people to vote for the current governor who is from the area. After he was elected to office he had to serve the larger interest groups, i.e., the massive state-owned monopoly Pemex that had recently discovered new oil and gas fields near Mata Gallina. This company does not employ locals as it has a largely politicized trade union.

The publican and landlady of the Imperial Hotel in Mount Thomas, Riley is in a unique position to assist the police thanks to her wealth of knowledge about the town and its inhabitants. Strong-willed and opinionated, she often serves a spokeswoman for important issues in the community, and eventually gains election to the local shire council. She is one of two characters, along with Tom Croydon, to appear in all thirteen seasons of the show, appearing in 507 of the 510 episodes to air.  Development and casting  The character of Chris Riley was created by Hal McElroy and Tony Morphett to be the publican and landlady of the Imperial Hotel, the Mount Thomas watering hole favoured by the town's police force. Her early characterisation is that of a helpful, friendly woman who is fiercely loyal to her friends, with a fiery temper to boot. During the early development of the show, McElroy conceived the rule that the producers of the show \\"couldn't have a camera in a room unless there was a copper there as well\\", with this rule extended to include the only two non-police members of the main cast, that being Chris Riley and Roz Patterson. Julie Nihill came to the role after playing the role of Jessie Bradman in Bodyline and guest roles in hit television shows such as Sons and Daughters, A Country Practice and Rafferty's Rules. In later years, Riley is portrayed as a shire councillor, which allows the character to take on a more significant role in the community, moving her away from simply being a friendly ear and occasional informant for the police.  Character background  Chris Riley is the Irish Australian daughter of a publican who was born and raised at the Imperial Hotel in Mount Thomas, the local pub owned by her father and frequented by the police. Her oldest friend in town is Tom Croydon, a friend from school who has gone on to become the sergeant of the local police station. At some point prior to the start of the series, she married Terry Kennedy, a shearer who did his national service in the same unit as Tom. Although Riley admitted to finding him beautiful, Terry was less than dependable and he walked out on the marriage some ten years before the first season.  Role on Blue Heelers  As the landlady of the Imperial Hotel, Chris Riley is a friend and confidante to many members of the local police station who frequent her pub, both during and outside of work hours. When she is first introduced, she provided lodgings for Maggie Doyle (Lisa McCune), the new constable in town, and helped her to play a prank on her new work colleagues, Nick Schultz (William McInnes) and P. J. Hasham (Martin Sacks), on her first night in town. Later that night, Riley asked Maggie for help when local girl Sally-Anne shows up at the pub claiming she was raped. As the case progresses, she did her best to offer Sally-Anne support, giving the suspect an earful when he tried to drink in her bar. Just before Anzac Day in 1994, Tom Croydon arrived at the pub after closing time and informed Riley that her ex-husband, Terry Kennedy, had been killed in a car accident, and she is needed to perform the identification because his face is unrecognisable from his injuries. After identifying him from his distinctive tattoo, she returned to the pub to find Terry climbing through her bedroom window. Despite her misgivings, she originally agreed not to tell the police of the mistaken identification and the two reconciled. This changes rapidly with the news that despite the fact they had never got an official divorce, Terry had gone on to marry another woman, thus committing bigamy. Although she is normally more than happy to help the local police, Riley was reluctant to testify as the key witness in a court case after the suspect's wife arrived in town and told her a sob story with her child in hand. When the police prosecutor subpoenaed her, forcing her to testify, she deliberately gave vague testimony which led to the suspects acquittal. The failure of this case, and Riley's part in it, briefly drove a wedge in her relationships with both P. J. and Tom. During mid 1995, Riley found herself held hostage in her own pub along with Adam Cooper (Damian Walshe-Howling) when a local man escaped from a prison van and held them both at gunpoint. The assailant, Dean Shipley, demanded to see his former football coach, Tom Croydon, who entered the bar without a bullet-proof vest and was shot non-fatally after Dean was spooked by a noise from outside. After getting drunk in an effort to cope with the trauma of being held hostage and seeing her best friend shot, Riley shared a kiss with Adam, and the pair ultimately began a short-lived sexual relationship. Midway through the fourth season, Riley's temper found her in hot water when she summarily dismissed a barman who was suspected of dealing alcohol to minors on the sly. Her assumption of his guilt, and her unwillingness to let the man state his case leads to her entire staff going on strike. As the strike wore on, she tried to do everything herself, but when a delivery driver chose to support the strike and not make an important delivery of alcohol, the threat of financial ruin finally forced her to the negotiation table. By early 1997, the news that Riley is planning to marry Irish immigrant Sean O'Malley draws mixed reactions from her friends and family. Tom cautions her that she might just be rushing things, but she waves off his concerns. Later, when Sean turns up dead in a graveyard from shotgun wounds, Riley learns that her fianc√© wasn't the man she thought he was, and that his past in Ireland had finally caught up to him. The following year, Riley found evidence of a mysterious fifty-year old cold case in the journal of a local woman, hidden behind a wall in the Imperial's cellar. Although she was initially enthusiastic about the case, she quickly began butting heads with the police once it became clear that the chief suspect is a local spinster and friend of hers. Although the evidence is seemingly against them, Tom's friendship with Riley keeps him from going through with charging the suspect, and the police ultimately uncover another suspect. Later that year, Riley had come to the conclusion that her business was in trouble. The building was old, the plumbing still wasn't fixed, and she wasn't making as much profit as she had hoped. This made her an easy mark for a travelling fraudster with plans to demolish the Imperial and replace it with a shopping mall. Luckily for her, the police were able to find evidence of the fraud and put an end to the scheme before it was too late. In early 1999, Riley decided to run for election as a member of the local shire council. When a couple of local kids were killed in a fiery car crash, her campaign manager used the opportunity to push a platform for youth issues and government spending. The media coverage was less than flattering, playing Riley as dragging in the victim's mother to score votes. Unfortunately, there was no time to clear up the issue, and her election was left in doubt thanks to voter backlash. Ultimately, though, she avoided most of the backlash, won the election and took her seat on the council. Shortly after being elected, Riley expressed her concerns about a proposal for an abattoir to be built down by the river, but she was shouted down by her constituents. Regardless of any environmental concerns, the townspeople were far more interested in the jobs that the proposal would create, and it looks like someone will stop at nothing to silence her when the Imperial's beer delivery is destroyed by a dangerous driving stunt and she found herself in hospital after being accidentally poisoned. In early 2004, Riley found herself up for re-election to the council against a local Muslim woman, Deniz Gulmez (Natasha Pincus). An ugly incident where one of the Riley's male bar-workers donned a burqa and sneaked into a female-only pool session sparked a fierce political battle between the two women. As racial tensions ran high, Deniz pointed the finger at her opponent after her meal at the pub is laced with peanuts, which she is highly allergic too. Ultimately, however, the two women found that they agreed on many issues, and Deniz withdrew from the election to act as Riley's campaign manager. Later that year, Riley was confronted with the past when her ex-husband, Terry, showed up in the pub cellar while an ex-lover, Dan Woodley, was found hiding in a crawlspace behind the guests' shower. Dan is wanted in Queensland in relation to an armed robbery, but when Joss Peroni (Danny Raco) returned to arrest him, Riley claimed he has left. Joss later returned with Tom, who warned her that she was at risk of being charged as an accessory, and was all set to have her hauled off in handcuffs when Dan turned himself in. While the police waited for an extradition request, Riley begged Tom to listen to Dan's story, a story that firmly pointed the finger at Terry. Even after Terry was found with the robbery weapon and proceeds, Tom refused to release Dan, leading to Chris angrily calling him out for having changed for the worse. In 2005, Riley found herself facing bankruptcy after she surprised a late night intruder in the bar. In the ensuing struggle, she was left with a badly cut hand while the female intruder was in a coma from a blow to the head. Although Tom wants the matter cleared up quickly, Detective Amy Fox (Rachel Gordon) can see inconsistencies in the story and keeps investigating. Against Tom's protests, Riley is arrested for assault, and she faced the prospect of losing her liquor licence if she were formally charged. Without a licence, it would only be a matter of time before going bankrupt. In an effort to clear her name, Evan Jones (Ditch Davey) asked Riley to walk him through what happened that night, and he came to suspect that there were two intruders. With this information in hand, Evan and Amy investigated the intruder's boyfriend, who confessed to the attempted burglary. They were able to prove that Riley acted in self-defence, which would be enough to save her liquor licence. By the time she received the news, however, she had already sold the pub. With the pub under new ownership, Riley settled herself into her new job as the pub's manager, initially with a strict new dress code, at least until she put her foot down with her new bosses.  Relationships   Romance  Chris Riley has been married once: * Terry Kennedy (Ivar Kants, later Frankie J. Holden) is Riley's ex-husband. Riley met Kennedy when she was working in her father's pub, the Imperial Hotel, when Kennedy walked in with a group of shearing mates. Riley was infatuated with him and they married a short time later. About ten years prior to the start of the series, Kennedy walked out of her life, seemingly for good, and only ever returned to ask for a loan. Prior to the start of the series, Riley had a romantic liaison with Dan Woodley (Greg Parker), who she called the \\"man she should have married\\". During the second season, she also had a brief relationship with Adam Cooper, which ended when Adam realised Riley didn't share his feelings. During the fourth season, Riley was engaged to Sean O'Malley, an Irish immigrant who had fled from The Troubles to Australia. The engagement ends when Sean is killed by his own son for deserting his IRA roots.  Family  Very little is known of Riley's immediate family apart from the fact that her father was the publican of the Imperial Hotel and left the pub in his daughter's ownership. During the first four seasons, Riley is shown to have several cousins, with Gail Jackson (Margaret Mills) and her daughter Jade (Breeanna Obst) appearing in the second season. Dominic Riley (Robin Dene) and his daughter Leonie (Rainey Mayo) appear several times starting from the fourth season.  Friends and colleagues  Riley is depicted as a long-time resident of Mount Thomas, and so she is shown to be friends with a number of local personalities. Her most significant friendship is the one she shares with Tom Croydon, the town's senior-most police officer. Having been friends since they were children, Riley often acts as a shoulder for Tom to lean on, and likewise he does the same for her. After Tom's wife is killed in the first season, there were occasional hints of a potential mutual attraction, but this was never expanded upon. Despite their close friendship, Tom's position as a police officer sometimes led to friction between the friends when they came down on opposite sides of the law. With Riley being the publican of the \\"watering hole\\" for the local police, she has made friends with most of the police officers who join the Mount Thomas Police, taking on a maternal role with many of them and her pub is frequently the first home for new constables when they first arrive in town. Among these officers, she was probably closest to Maggie Doyle, the first female constable to be posted to the town. Much like her friendship with their boss, however, their closeness didn't stop Riley from giving them a piece of her mind if she thought they were wrong. Riley is also shown to be active in the community, not only as a councillor, but also as a member of, and frequent host of the Country Women's Association. Her position with the CWA gives her a close friendship with several of the town's older women, including local personalities like Leila Clegg and Winifred Starling. As an employer, Riley has been shown to be demanding of her staff, leading her to have a sometimes acrimonious relationship with several of them, especially with her first chef, Jeannie. In one third season episode, she fires one of her barmen without giving him a chance to tell his side of the story after he is accused of selling alcohol to minors. This act leads to her entire staff going out on strike, and she is forced to apologise to them all when she is unable to even get her beer delivery through their picket line.  Personality  As a publican in a country town, Chris Riley is portrayed as the kind of woman who knows everyone, and who everyone knows. If something is going on in town, there's a very good chance that she will have heard about it. If the police need the latest gossip, it's often Riley that they turn to, and she is normally more than willing to give them a helping hand. She isn't completely immune to sweet talking, however, and there are times where a smooth-talking criminal has convinced her not to help the authorities. Despite dealing with her rough-and-tumble clientele on a daily basis, she has a maternal nature and often acts as a den mother for the town's cohort of young constables, offering them lodging in her pub, and a friendly ear if they need it. She hates being called \\"Mrs. Riley\\", and is known universally as Chris, or occasionally \\"Chrissy\\". She does have a redhead's temper, however, and she is more than willing to ban someone from her pub, or give them an earful if she feels they deserve it. After her election to the shire council, Riley shows she isn't afraid to take an unpopular decision if she thinks it is in the best interests of her constituents. Even when she is faced with an angry mob, or with the possibility she might've been poisoned, she has the tenacity to stick to her guns and find a way to work things out.  Reception  Although Blue Heelers was not expected to become a popular programme, the show became a hit shortly after it began airing, with much of this success credited to the quality of the ensemble cast, including Julie Nihill as Chris Riley.

He was respected and admired by contemporaries, judging by the widespread inclusion of his work in chansonniers and in citations by other troubadours. Though his biography is made confounding by contradicting statements in his vida and allusions in his and others' poems, Perdigon's status as a jongleur from youth and an accomplished fiddler is well-attested in contemporary works (by him and others) and manuscript illustrations depicting him with his fiddle. Perdigon travelled widely and was patronised by Dalfi d'Alvernha, the Baux,Probably Guillem des Baux (Aubrey, 218). Peter II of Aragon, and Barral of Marseille. His service to the latter provides an early definite date for his career, as Barral died in 1192 and Perdigon composed a canso--which survives with music-- for him. According to his vida, Perdigon was the son of a poor fisherman who excelled through his \\"wit and inventiveness\\" to honour and fame, was clothed and eventually armed, knighted, and granted land and rent by Dalfi d'Alvernha. After this period of his life, which is said to have lasted a long time, the manuscripts of his vida diverge.

The biographer further claims that Perdigon sang to the populace to encourage the Crusade and even boasted of humiliating Peter II of Aragon who opposed the Crusades and died at the Battle of Muret fighting against the Crusaders. For this reason he became despised by those in favor of Catharism, and due to the war lost all his friends who fought in it: Simon de Montfort, Guillem des Baux,This personage was the Prince of Orange, but it was probably a similarly named Uc des Baux with whom Perdigon was acquainted (Egan, 84). and many others. In the end, the son of Dalfi d'Alvernha, abandoned him, confiscated his land, and sent him away. The biographer claims that he went to Lambert de Monteil and begged to be entered into the Cistercian monastery of \\"Silvabela\\", but the author incorrectly believes Lambert to be the son-in-law of Guillem des Baux, and the monastery Silvabela (\\"beautiful forest\\") never existed. His vidas are questionable. Among Perdigon's surviving songs is a torneyamen with Raimbaut de Vaqueiras and Ademar de Peiteus.Aubrey, 231. Unusually for the period, Perdigon, along with Aimeric de Peguilhan, through- composed his melodies.Aubrey, 169. Sources * Aubrey, Elizabeth. The Music of the Troubadours.

It is located on the third floor of Beverley Street Public School, an elementary school for disabled children. Subway II (as it is referred to by many students) offers an unconventional approach to schooling, with a more flexible schedule, and one on one sessions with teachers. The school received its name from Subway Academy I, as it was an offshoot of that school. Despite the name, it is not accessible by the subway, and most students take the 510 Spadina streetcar to get to school. Nearby landmarks include Kensington Market, the University of Toronto, and the Art Gallery of Ontario. School & School Day Students arrive between 9:00 and 11:00. When they arrive, they sign in on a whiteboard. Teachers then see students on a first-come-first-served basis. Consequentially, students who arrive at 9:00 may be finished for the day by 9:30, while students who show up closer to 11:00 may have to wait until well into the afternoon to be seen. If they arrive after 11:30 am, they may not be able to check in with their teachers at all. Students need to stay on the property until they have met all teachers on that day. During a typical meeting, the student will hand in completed assignments, discuss projects, work on new ideas and concepts, then pick up new assignments. Almost all work is done independently. Students are only scheduled to attend three days per week, but they are allowed to attend all five if they like. The school environment includes a half-dozen computers, a blackboard for group collaboration, a VCR/DVD player, a full kitchen, and a sizable lending library. Subway II is a very small school, and the lack of a science lab or gymnasium limits course offerings. However, Subway does offer a number of higher-level philosophy, sociology and law courses‚Äîas well as hands- on courses like parenting and nutrition‚Äîthat many mainstream high schools are unable to provide. Student body The flexible nature of Subway II's teaching has attracted a wide and eclectic student body despite its incredibly small size. 28% of the student population is male, while 66,26% is female. 27% have a first language other than English. Due to the small size however, these numbers are subject to change. Subway II has relatively few extracurricular activities. Subway attempts to address this with guest speakers and field trips, both of which are typically open to anyone wishing to attend. Subway II currently has four teachers, for a teacher-to-student ratio of 1:20..

Lyrical content \\"White America\\" is segued into by the opening skit \\"Curtains Up\\" on The Eminem Show, which involves Eminem walking up to a microphone to make a speech. It addresses the controversy stemming from Eminem's lyrical content, and impacting white youth, expressed with lines such as: \\"I speak to suburban kids, who otherwise would've never knew these words exist.\\" \\"Eric\\" and \\"Erica\\" are representations of any white youth. Eminem also expressed his belief that his music is controversial only because it appeals to white kids, with lines such as, \\"Hip-hop was never a problem in Harlem, only in Boston / after it bothered the fathers of daughters starting to blossom.\\" Eminem also states his belief that his skin color helped with his popularity, and in effect introduced white fans to his producer, Dr. Dre, although earlier in his career it had prevented him from being taken seriously. The song also discusses the freedom of speech of the US Constitution through attacks on the then-Second Lady of the United States Lynne Cheney and her predecessor Tipper Gore, who questioned Eminem's legitimacy to freedom of speech and introduced the Parental Advisory sticker respectively. Music video \\"White America\\" had an animated music video that featured imagery related to the lyrics, including Eminem on a wanted poster and later being lynched while the US Constitution is torn up in the foreground.

It is part of the Brisbane metropolitan area. In the , Joyner had a population of 2,833 people.  Geography  Joyner is located east of, and is contiguous with Lake Samsonvale. The area was originally known as Harrisons Pocket before the modern day adaptation and implementation of the name Joyner. Essentially, the Joyner area may be considered as one of the numerous sub-catchments of the North Pine River drainage basin. This basin extends from the western ranges all the way to Moreton Bay. Joyner is 11 kilometres from the sea. The origin of the name Joyner is from the Joyner family, early settlers in the area. History Prior to white settlement the Joyner area and beyond was occupied by the aboriginal Turbal tribe who survived by hunting and gathering. William Joyner, from Berkeley, Gloucester, England, arrived in Sydney in 1841, and in 1844 set out with a friend named Mason in a bullock dray, heading north to look for grazing land. He eventually selected 400 square miles south of the North Pine River. That land includes the present day locality of Joyner. William Joyner established the station \\"Samson Vale\\" in 1845. A thriving rural community developed thereafter in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. After the pioneering era, the area we now call Joyner, came into contact with several thousand American and Australian troops stationed in the locality to train and prepare, before being sent north to fight the Japanese in the Pacific during WW2. The next most notable historical event was the establishment of the North Pine Dam, which dislocated farming activities, starting with surveying of the future impoundment in the fifties, and ending when Lake Samsonvale was filled in 1975 flooding numerous farms. This event all but destroyed a thriving rural community that had existed for over 100 years in the North Pine River valley. In the , Joyner had a population of 2,766 people. Industries The most notable feature of the area is the North Pine Dam and Treatment Plant which supplies a significant volume of potable water to the Moreton Bay Region and Brisbane City utilising water from Lake Samsonvale. The Plant supplies water in the order of 100ML per day. Joyner is also home to the bus depot of Thompsons Bus Service which operates bus services mostly in the Pine Rivers District area.  Amenities  Forgan Road which runs along the eastern shore of Lake Samsonvale, gives access to popular fishing and picnic spots making the area a valuable recreational resource for locals and visitors. Important centres for recreational activities exist at Bullocky Rest and also at Forgan Cove, near the intersection with Samsonvale Road. Forgan Cove has been designated as a zone for paddle craft use by the public on the lake. Lake Samsonvale is stocked with several native fish species. These facilities have been provided by the South East Queensland Water Board. One Mile Creek more or less bisects Joyner south-west to north- east and enters the North Pine River south of Nelson Road. Pleasant parks have been established along the creek banks in several areas adding to the amenity of the locality. Joyner is also home to a popular YMCA camp, Camp Warrawee, off Byrnes Road North, and bordered by the North Pine River on the northern and western sides. The camp has been established for many decades and utilises the river for many recreational and youth development activities such as canoeing. The Camp has accommodation for 232. At the confluence of North Pine River and Sideling Creek off Youngs Crossing Road, a large sand bank forms the basis for a popular swimming and fishing area. This natural feature has been enhanced with facilities provided by Moreton Bay Regional Council. Although Joyner has few commercial facilities of its own, amenities such as shops, schools, churches, medical clinics etc. are available in the adjoining localities, many right on the Joyner locality boundary. Demographics In the , Joyner recorded a population of 2,766 people, 48.8% female and 51.2% male. The median age of the Joyner population was 34 years, 3 years below the national median of 37. Of people living in Joyner, 78.7% were born in Australia. The other top responses for country of birth were New Zealand (5.1%), England (4.1%), South Africa (2.5%), Ireland (0.4%), and Fiji (0.4%). Of the people 92% spoke only English at home; the next most common languages were Afrikaans (0.8%), Hindi (0.4%), Spanish (0.4%), Samoan, and Italian (0.3%).

The play was first performed on January 12, 1895 in the Deutsches Theater in Berlin.Ibsen, Ibsen: The Complete Major Prose Plays, 1138. Plot Little Eyolf tells the story of the Allmers family. At the outset of the play, the father, Alfred, has just returned from a trip to the mountains. While there, he resolved to focus foremost on raising his son Eyolf, rather than continue work on his book, Human Responsibility. Eyolf, though described as having \\"beautiful, intelligent eyes,\\"Ibsen, Ibsen: The Complete Major Prose Plays, 870. is paralyzed in one of his legs, and thus his life is a sheltered one. He craves more than anything else to live the life of a normal boy, but his father knows that this is not possible. As such, Alfred wants to turn Eyolf towards loftier, intellectual pursuits. The Allmers household is soon visited by the Rat-Wife, a woman capable of enchanting rodents into following her into the sea, where they drown. She leaves when informed that her services are unnecessary, and Eyolf follows her, unnoticed by Alfred, his wife Rita, and Alfred's sister Asta. Once Eyolf is gone, Alfred details his plan for being a better father to Eyolf and allowing him to attain happiness. In the course of his description, they are visited by Borghejm, an engineer, who is interested in Asta. While Asta and Borghejm walk outside, Rita's possessiveness of Alfred is revealed, during which she even wishes that Eyolf had never been born, as he diverts Alfred's attention from herself. Rita and Alfred's conversation is interrupted by the return of Asta and Borghejm, and then followed by sounds of shouts down by the sea, which reveal that Eyolf has drowned after following the Rat-Wife into the sea. Down by the sea, Alfred mourns and is comforted by Asta. Rita and Borghejm follow, and once again Borghejm removes Asta from the action allowing for confrontation between Rita and Alfred. In the course of their conversation, Rita talks more about needing Alfred wholly while Alfred reveals that he married Rita in order to be able to better Asta's life. They also each blame each other for Eyolf's injury (as a baby, he fell off a table while they were making love), with Alfred accusing Rita of \\"luring me in to you,\\"Ibsen, Ibsen: The Complete Major Prose Plays, 909. distracting him from his duty to watch over Eyolf. Borghejm and Asta return, and Borghejm is once again unsuccessful at convincing Asta to marry him. However, when asked by Alfred and Rita to stay with them and take Eyolf's place, somehow allowing them to ease their guilt and avoid the problems in their relationship, Asta decides to marry Borghejm and follow him north. With Alfred indicating a continued unwillingness to be the husband Rita desires, she shares her new plan to try to better the lives of the poorer children who live down by the sea. In this, Alfred sees something positive again in Rita, and Alfred decides to remain, so that together they can atone for their mistakes. Characters * Alfred Allmers * Rita Allmers, his wife * Eyolf, their son, nine years old * Asta Allmers, Alfred's younger half-sister * Borghejm, a road builder * The Rat-Wife (said to be based on Kristine Cathrine Ploug) Adaptations A production of Little Eyolf was featured in the BBC television anthology series Play of the Month in July 1982.

Five former students, one former teacher, a former assistant principal and two former principals, former and current Marist officials and clergy, and one of the clergy at the centre of the allegations gave evidence or made statements before the Royal Commission that the alleged cases of abuse happened during the 1970s and 1980s at Daramalan College, Canberra, at , and in Far North Queensland. In March 2015 a former Marist brother was arrested over a number of sex offences allegedly committed at St Joseph's College in and St Gregory's College in Campbelltown in the 1980s.

Cincinnatus was a son of the Roman dictator Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus. His trial for obstructing the tribunes of the plebs in 461 BC was one of the key events in the Conflict of the Orders in the years leading up to the decemvirate. Background A scion of the noble patrician house of the Quinctii, Caeso was tall and strong, and had earned a reputation as a fine soldier, to whom several feats of courage and daring were attributed. He was also considered an excellent public speaker. His uncle, Titus Quinctius Capitolinus Barbatus, had been thrice consul, and there was every reason to believe that Caeso would one day hold the same office.Livy, iii, 11‚Äì2.Dionysius, x. 5. But in the disputes between the patricians and the plebeians, Caeso unreservedly took the side of the aristocratic party, and despite holding no position of authority, he and his followers took it upon themselves to prevent the tribunes of the people from meeting in the forum to conduct their business. If anyone dared oppose them, Caeso and his friends resorted to violence, driving away the plebeians and their representatives. Testimony In response, Aulus Verginius, one of the plebeian tribunes, brought the young Quinctius to trial on a capital charge. This only seems to have encouraged Caeso to pursue his war against the tribunes more vigorously, further increasing the young man's reputation for violence.Dionysius, x. 6. Several prominent men testified in Caeso's defense: his uncle described his nobility and fine personal qualities, as well as his worth as a soldier; Spurius Furius Medullinus described how the young man had rescued him from danger and helped him win a great victory; Lucius Lucretius Tricipitinus, the consul of the preceding year, described Caeso's military exploits and natural gifts, and urged that he not be judged too harshly in light of his age and lack of wisdom; and Caeso's father, Lucius Quinctius, begged forgiveness for his son's excesses. However, the trial was decided largely on the testimony of Marcus Volscius Fictor, a former tribune, who claimed that Caeso had struck his elder brother, Lucius, during a melee in the Subura. Lucius Volscius was in a weakened state, not fully recovered from the pestilence of 463, and had died as a result of the young nobleman's attack. After Marcus had told this story, the crowd tried to attack Caeso, and was only restrained with difficulty. Verginius ordered his arrest, but Titus Quinctius objected, since Caeso had not yet been tried. After some debate, the other tribunes granted Caeso his freedom until the trial could be held, granting bail of 3,000 asses, to be given by ten sureties.Livy, iii. 13.Dionysius, x. 7, 8. Exile and death Believing that he would be convicted based on the tribune Volscius' testimony, as well as his violent reputation, Quinctius chose exile over a possible sentence of death, and departed for Etruria under cover of darkness. Verginius still wished to try the young man in absentia, but was prevented from doing so when the other tribunes accepted the explanation that Caeso had voluntarily gone into exile, and dismissed the assembly. Nevertheless, the young man's father, Lucius Quinctius, forfeited the sum of 3,000 asses, which required him to sell his house and property. He left Rome and settled in a small house on the other side of the Tiber.Livy, iii. 14.Dionysius, x. 8. The following year, there was a rumour, apparently unfounded, that Caeso had returned to Rome, at the head of a conspiracy of young noblemen, and aided by the Aequi and Volsci, with the intention of killing the tribunes of the plebs and anyone else who had opposed the aristocracy. In 459, an attempt was made to bring Volscius to trial, on the grounds that his brother had died without ever having recovered enough from the plague to leave his bed, while Caeso had been out of the city at the time. The effort was unsuccessful, but tried again the following year, when Caeso's uncle Titus was quaestor. According to Livy, Volscius was convicted of perjury, and went into exile at Lanuvium, but by this time it appears that Caeso had died, much to his father's grief.Livy, iii. 15, 24, 25, 29.Dionysius, x. 9‚Äì13. Historicity In A Critical History of Early Rome, Gary Forsythe suggests that the story of Caeso Quinctius should be regarded as a later addition to the narrative of the conflict of the orders, providing an example of an injustice done to the patricians, and adding colour to the story of his father's stoic attitude and subsequent redemption.Forsythe, p. 204.

The resort has been owned by the Kiesendahl Family since 1958 and is open all year round. In recent years, Woodloch Pines has expanded to include Woodloch Springs, a championship golf course and housing community, and The Lodge at Woodloch, a destination spa. History Mary Mould had been vacationing at Lake Teedyuskung for years when she married Harry Kiesendahl in 1944. They settled on Long Island where they raised their 3 children, John, Nancy, and Steve. Harry saw an advertisement in the New York Times for a small boarding house for sale on Lake Teedyuskung. Soon after, the Kiesendahls purchased the resort. In 1958, Mary and the children moved to the resort while Harry commuted from Long Island on the weekends. Its original consisted of a main lodge, an annex, and two cottages, which could accommodate 40 guests. There was no running water and one year- round employee. Around this time was when the reports started to come about Teedy, the mysterious lake monster who supposedly lives at the bottom of Lake Teedyuskung. In 1959, Mary and Harry Kiesendahl were joined by friends Don and Marge Kranich. After several years of building, Woodloch Pines had doubled in size. By 1983, the resort covered , of shoreline on Lake Teedyuskung, and had 135 guest rooms. Woodloch is currently on and can accommodate over 900 guests. Woodloch is still run by the Kiesendahl family, with son John as the current president and CEO. Woodloch and the Boy Scouts of America Daniel Carter Beard, one of the original founders of the Boy Scouts of America, once owned three parcels of land on Lake Teedyuskung and built the original cabin home of the Boy Scouts there. \\"Wild Lands\\" was the mess hall for the Boy Scouts and stood on what eventually became Woodloch property for over eighty years. In 2011, Woodloch donated \\"Wild Lands\\" back to the Boy Scouts. The cabin was disassembled and transported to the Goose Pond Boy Scout Reservation on Lake Wallenpaupack, where the ongoing project of reassembling the cabin in its original form is taking place. Additions Woodloch Springs, opened in 1991, is a community and golf course with over 400 homes of varying sizes that can be purchased or rented by Woodloch Pines‚Äô guests. The Springs has also been used for corporate retreats. The Lodge at Woodloch is a destination spa that opened in 2006. The Lodge is a separate facility from the Woodloch Pines resort. It is five minutes away from The Pines, across the street from Woodloch Springs, on Little Lake Teedyuskung. The spa resort is operated by the Kiesendahl family. The Reserve at Woodloch is a real estate project that is currently in development.

They finally meet after almost 20 years, as rivals on opposite sides of an English‚ÄìViking war. It is a loose remake of the American film The Vikings. Plot In 786 AD, three large Viking ships land in England. King Harald (Folco Lulli), the only Viking chieftain interested in maintaining peace, makes a plea to King Loter (Franco Ressel). The English king sends Sir Rutford (Andrea Checchi) to work out a deal with the Vikings. Rutford stages a surprise attack on the Vikings. King Harald is felled by an arrow fired by Rutford's chief assassin. During the battle, Harold's two young sons, Erik and Eron, are whisked away by one of his chiefs. Eron is rescued but Erik is left behind in the chaos. Later, King Loter arrives on the scene, where he threatens to strip Rutford of his title. Rutford retaliates by having his assassin kill Loter with an arrow. Loter's wife, Queen Alice (Fran√ßoise Christophe), runs away and after finding Erik hiding on the beach decides to raise him as her own son. 20 years later, the Vikings once again wage war against England. The adult Eron (Cameron Mitchell ), has fallen in love with a vestal virgin named Daya (Ellen Kessler), the identical twin sister of the vestal Rama (Alice Kessler). They hide their love out of fear of being executed. Eron tells Daya that a king is permitted to marry a vestal. Viking leader King Olaf (Jean-Jacques Delbo) makes a pact with the kingdoms of Iceland, Norway, and Sweden to invade England once again. Due to his age, Olaf appoints a younger to lead the attack. Olaf chooses Eron but his choice is contested by Garian (Joe Robinson). Garian wishes to be elected leader, and a vote by 100 warriors is taken. Olaf declares that they will have to fight to the death. Eron is victorious but refuses to kill his opponent, asking Garian to serve as his right-hand man. In England, the adult Erik (Giorgio Ardisson) is appointed Duke of Helford and leader of the English sea forces, replacing Sir Rutford. Rutford plants an agent on board to set fire to Erik's ship while at sea. The Viking and English fleets meet in the North Sea and a sea battle begins. Vikings board Erik's flagship just as the agent sets fire to it. In the battle, Erik and Eron meet and engage in a sword fight. Erik's ship catches fire. Erik jumps overboard and later washes ashore in Viking land. He is found by Rama. Rama points Erik in the direction of a local fishing village, where he is accepted by the Vikings as a shipwrecked fisherman. Back in England, Sir Rutford proposes marriage to the queen, who rebuffs him. Eron and his men arrive. Eron then appoints Rutford as Regent and takes Queen Alice as a hostage back to Viking land. There, Rama is assigned to look after Queen Alice. Rama notices that the queen also wears a cross and mentions this to Erik. Demanding to know the prisoner's name, Erik is shocked to find that it's his 'mother'. The next day, Eron and Daya are to be married. As Erik watches the wedding ceremony, he mistakenly believes that it is Rama who is being married. Enraged by this imagined 'affront', Erik confronts Daya, who doesn't know him. Erik is then locked away by King Olaf to be executed the following morning. Rama drugs Erik's guards, explains to him that the woman he saw married was her twin sister, and cuts him free. While they flee, Eron and a horde of Vikings give pursuit. Eron nearly falls to his death but Erik, urged by Rama, rescues him from certain death. Eron continues to pursue them but Erik and Rama meet up with Queen Alice and they safely sail to England. Erik gathers a combined English-Scottish force to attack Rutford's castle but finds that Eron and the Vikings have arrived before him. Erik challenges Eron to a duel. Eron accepts, leaving Daya in Rutford's care. In the ensuing sword fight, Eron catches sight of the tattoo on Erik's chest and recognises him as his brother. He declares a ceasefire, upsetting Rutford, who responds by having his henchman fire an arrow at Erik. Eron throws himself in the path of the arrow and is fatally wounded. The enraged Vikings attempt to storm the castle, but Rutford raises the drawbridge and threatens to kill Daya by the next morning if the Vikings do not disband. As Eron lies dying, he names Erik as his successor. Becoming more and more delirious, he asks to see Daya one last time. Erik determines to do this by breaking her out of the castle. Erik scales the castle wall. Meanwhile, Rama realizes that the dying Eron will not last much longer and poses as her sister to him. Eron is oblivious to the deception and, upon declaring his love for her, finally dies. Erik makes his way into the castle, where he rescues Daya. At dawn, the combined Viking, English and Scottish armies attack the castle, scaling the walls and slaughtering the defenders. All of Rutford's men are killed, with Rutford himself being the last to fall when he attempts to throw a spear at the escaping Eron but is pierced with at least a dozen Viking arrows. With peace restored, Queen Alice reclaims her throne and allows Erik to leave England to claim his title as King of the Vikings. Erik returns to Viking land with Rama, while Daya sails alone with the dead Eron.

Reception In a contemporary review, reviewing an English-dubbed 88 minutes version, the Monthly Film Bulletin stated that the film is \\"enhanced by Mario Bava's luridly filtered photography and fluid camera technique, and his effortlessly eclectic direction\\" The review concluded that apart from the soundtrack which was described as \\"shattering\\", the technical credits were \\"above average, as is some of the acting\\", specifically pointing out Giorgio Ardisson and Andrea Checchi. Due to the \\"effective\\" acting of Cameron Mitchell and the \\"full-sized Viking ships\\" this film has been named the best Viking picture made in Italy.

A lateral shoot, commonly known as a branch, is a part of a plant's shoot system that develops from axillary buds on the stem's surface, extending laterally from the plant's stem. Importance to photosynthesis As a plant grows it requires more energy, it also is required to out-compete nearby plants for this energy. One of the ways a plant can compete for this energy is to increase its height, another is to increase its overall surface area. That is to say, the more lateral shoots a plant develops, the more foliage the plant can support increases how much photosynthesis the plant can perform as it allows for more area for the plant to uptake carbon dioxide as well as sunlight. Genes, transcription factors, and growth Through testing with Arabidopsis thaliana (A plant considered a model organism for plant genetic studies) genes including MAX1 and MAX2 have been found to affect growth of lateral shoots. Gene knockouts of these genes cause abnormal proliferation of the plants affected, implying they are used for repressing said growth in wild type plants. Another set of experiments with Arabidopsis thaliana testing genes in the plant hormone florigen, two genes FT and TSF (which are abbreviations for Flowering Locus T, and Twin Sister of FT) when knocked out, appear to affect lateral shoot in a negative fashion. These mutants cause slower growth and improper formation of lateral shoots, which could also mean that lateral shoots are important to florigen's function. Along with general growth there are also transcription factors that directly effect the production of additional lateral shoots like the TCP family (also known as Teosinte branched 1/cycloidea/proliferating cell factor) which are plant specific proteins that suppress lateral shoot branching. Additionally the TCP family has been found to be partially responsible for inhibiting the cell's Growth hormone‚Äìreleasing hormone (GHRF) which means it also inhibits cell proliferation.

Since its establishment in the 1920's, the area has always been associated with German-Jewish culture and tradition. The quarter remained an island of German culture and language long after the establishment of the state of Israel and up to this day through the Schocken library (by late German-Jewish editor Salman Schocken) the largest and most significant collection of German books in the country is to be found in the neighborhood.https://www.haaretz.com/1.4828323 Name The suburb received its name from Eliezer Yellin, its first inhabitant and one of its early architects, and was named after Moses' grandson, \\"Rehavia\\",http://www.timesofisrael.com/how-rambans-desolate-jerusalem-area- transformed-into-yekkes-rehavia/ a name also transliterated as \\"Rehabiah\\" in biblical context (). History The garden city model of Berlin's Grunewald neighborhood became one of the major influences for Rehavia Rehavia was established on a large plot of land purchased in 1921 from the Greek Orthodox Church by the Palestine Land Development Company (PLDC) and the first house was completed in 1924. It was given the biblical name Rehavia. The area was known at the time by the Arab name of Ginzaria, a native Jerusalem plant, elsewhere spelled as Janjirieh. The Jewish National Fund (JNF) bought the land and commissioned the German-Jewish architect Richard Kauffmann to design a garden neighborhood.Inbal Ben-Asher Gitler, \\"Marrying Modern Progress with Treasured Antiquity\\": Jerusalem City Plans during the British Mandate, 1917-1948, in Traditional Dwellings and Settlements Review, Vol. 15, No. 1 (FALL 2003), p. 47 (entire article: pp. 39-58), published by: International Association for the Study of Traditional Environments (IASTE) Kauffmann, who spelled the name of his project as Janziriah, created a typical Garden City neighbourhood, with gardens surrounding the houses and an orderly, but not too strict grid of streets and footpaths set in relation to the main boulevard cutting through the area, thus avoiding an excessive sense of symmetry. For legalistic reasons the land had to be transferred back to the PLDC in exchange for lands in the Jezreel Valley, but the JNF retained some real-estate in the neighborhood. The Gymnasia Rehavia high school, Yeshurun Synagogue, and the Jewish Agency building were built on this land, overlooking the Old City. Rehavia's general outline was modelled after the garden cities of Europe (especially Germany, e.g. the quarters of Dahlem or Grunewald in Berlin), while the architecture of the buildings shows an emphasis on the International Style popular at the time. The first phase, called Rehavia Aleph, was bordered by King George Street to the east, Ramban Street to the south, Ussishkin Street to the west, and Keren Kayemet Street to the north. To preserve the quiet character, the neighborhood association allowed commercial businesses only on the two main roads at the neighborhood's edges. The roads open to traffic were deliberately built narrow, to keep them less busy and thus quieter. The main, tree-lined boulevard which bisected the neighborhood was open to pedestrian traffic only. Later expansion was primarily to the south, in the direction of Gaza Street. The Prime Minister's Official Residence is the \\"Aghion House\\", at No. 3 Balfour Street near the corner with Smolenskin Street. Demographics When the Ethiopian emperor Haile Selassie was exiled from Ethiopia in 1936, he lived on Al-Harizi Street.Daniel Jacobs, The Rough Guide to Jerusalem, 2009, p.300 Rehavia became known as a neighborhood of upper-class Ashkenazi Jews, home to professors and intellectuals, particularly √©migr√©s from Germany. Many of the country's early leaders lived in Rehavia: David Ben-Gurion, Israel's first prime minister, who lived on Ben Maimon street; Zionist leader Arthur Ruppin; Menachem Ussishkin, head of the Jewish National Fund; Golda Meir, Israel's fourth prime minister; Daniel Auster, the first Jewish mayor of Jerusalem, and philosophers Hugo Bergmann and Gershon Scholem. Among the government ministers who made their home in Rehavia were Dov Yosef and Yosef Burg. Landmarks Gymnasia Rehavia High School Landmark buildings in Rehavia include the headquarters of the Jewish Agency for Israel, the windmill on Ramban Street, and the Ratisbonne Monastery. Gymnasia Rehavia, the country's second modern high school (after Gymnasia Herzliya in Tel Aviv) was built on Keren Kayemet Street in 1928. Yitzhak Ben Zvi, who was to become the second president of Israel, and his future wife, Rachel Yanait, were teachers there. In the center of historic Rehavia is Yad Ben-Zvi, a research institute established by Ben-Zvi. Jason's Tomb was discovered during construction work on Alfasi Street.Jerusalem tombs Street names Most of Rehavia's streets are named after Jewish scholars and poets from the Golden Age of Jewish culture in Spain. Among them are Abravanel, Ben Maimon, Ibn Ezra, Rabbi Moses ben Nachman (Ramban), and Radak. There are few exceptions, most notably Rechov Keren Kayemet Le'Israel (Jewish National Fund) and Rechov Ussishkin. In 1926, a street was named Keren Kayemet Le'Israel to honor the 25th year of the Jewish National Fund. In 1934, the Rehavia neigborhood council decided to change the name of this street to Rechov Ussishkin, and move Rechov Keren Kayemet Le'Israel to its present location.Dotan Goren, Et- Mol 247 (August 2016), pages 23-26 (in Hebrew).

The attack was precipitated by growing Iroquois frustration with the increased French incursions into their territory, ongoing concern about French Marquis de Denonville's attack of 1687, and was encouraged by the settlers of New England as a way to leverage power against New France during King William's War. In their attack, the Mohawk warriors destroyed a substantial portion of the Lachine settlement by fire and killed or captured numerous inhabitants, although historic sources have varied widely in their estimates of the number of people who were killed, from 24 to 250. Background and motivations The Mohawk and other Iroquois attacked the French and their native allies for a variety of reasons, related to both economic and cultural circumstances. Cultural motives The Europeans in the Northeast developed a fur trade with natives, including the Five Nations of the Iroquois; beaver furs were most desired. However, in the 17th century, the dominance of what historian Daniel Richter refers to as \\"Francophiles\\" or French takeover, contributed to an erosion of French-native relations. The French mission to assimilate natives required the abandonment of native tradition, which was met with resistance. By 1667, large numbers of Huron and Iroquois, especially Mohawk, started arriving at the St Lawrence Valley and its mission villages, to escape the effects of warfare. Many traditionalists, including some Mohawk, resented the Jesuits for destroying traditional native society but were unable to do anything to stop them. However, traditionalists reluctantly accepted the establishment of a mission in order to have good relations with the French, whom they needed for trade. This cultural invasion increased tensions between the two factions. The relationship between the French and the Iroquois was strained long before the Lachine Massacre, as the French maintained relations with other tribes as well, for both trade and war alliances, such as the Abenaki. In 1679, following the end of the Iroquois war with the Susquehannock and the Mahican, the Iroquois raided native villages in the West. Pushing out Siouan tribes to the west, they claimed hunting grounds in the Ohio Valley by right of conquest. These were kept empty of inhabitants in order to encourage hunting. As a result, the Iroquois regularly raided trading parties in the western frontier which was under French protection, and took loot from them. Following military confrontation in 1684, though the Iroquois negotiated a peace treaty with New France governor Antoine Lef√®bvre de La Barre, the treaty stated the Iroquois were free to attack the western Indians. The French Crown objected to the treaty, and replaced La Barre with the Marquis de Denonville. He was less sympathetic to native relations, and did not pay attention to the Iroquois-Algonquian tensions. In part, the Iroquois attacked the French because they were not willing to accept constraints against their warfare related to traditional Iroquois enemies. What were known as \\"mourning wars\\" were also an important cultural factor in native warfare. Natives fought war to \\"avenge perceived wrongs committed by one people against another\\". These mourning wars were also a means to replace the dead within a native community. In times of war, natives would capture members of another native group and adopt them in order to rebuild their society. When new diseases such as smallpox killed large numbers of native people within their communities, survivors were motivated to warfare in order to take captives to rebuild. Economic motives What the Iroquois wanted was not war, but instead a better share of the fur trade. To serve as punishment for attacks on French fur fleets, New France ordered two expeditions under Courcelles and Tracy into Mohawk territory in 1666. These expeditions burned villages and destroyed much of the Mohawk winter corn supply. In addition, Denonville's 1687 invasion of the Seneca nation country destroyed approximately 1,200,000 bushels of corn, crippling the Iroquois economy. This kind of aggression served as fuel for the Iroquois' retaliation that was to come. Following two decades of uneasy peace, Britain and France declared war against one another in 1689. Despite the 1669 Treaty of Whitehall, in which European forces agreed that Continental conflicts would not disrupt colonial peace and neutrality, the war was fought primarily by proxy in New France and New England. The British of New York prompted local Iroquois warriors to attack New France's undefended settlements. While the British were preparing to engage in acts of warfare, the inhabitants of New France were ill-prepared to defend against the Indian attacks\\" due to the isolation of the farms and villages. Denonville was quoted as saying \\"If we have a war, nothing can save the country but a miracle of God,\\". The attack Daniel d'Auger de Subercase On the rainy morning of August 5, 1689, Iroquois warriors used surprise to launch their nighttime raid against the undefended settlement of Lachine. They traveled up the Saint Lawrence River by boat, crossed Lake Saint-Louis, and landed on the south shore of Montreal Island. While the colonists slept, the invaders surrounded their homes and waited for their leader to signal when the attack should begin. They attacked the homes, breaking down doors and windows, and dragging the colonists outside, where many were killed. When some of the colonists barricaded themselves within the village's structures, the attackers set fire to the buildings and waited for the settlers to flee the flames. According to a 1992 article, the Iroquois, wielding weapons such as the tomahawk, killed 24 French and took more than 70 prisoners.; Justin Winsor in Narrative and Critical History of America (1884) stated \\"it is estimated that more than two hundred persons were butchered outright, and one hundred and twenty were carried off as prisoners\\". Other sources, such as Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, claim that 250 settlers and soldiers lost their lives during the \\"Massacre.\\" The Iroquois wanted to avenge the 1,200,000 bushels of corn burned by the French, but since they were unable to reach the food stores in Montreal, they kidnapped and killed the Lachine crop producers instead. Lachine was the main departure point for westward-traveling fur traders, a fact which may have provided extra motivation for the Mohawk attack. Aftermath Fort R√©my, also known as Fort Lachine. Word of the attack spread when one of the Lachine survivors reached a local garrison, away, and notified the soldiers of the events. In response to the attack, the French mobilized 200 soldiers, under the command of Daniel d'Auger de Subercase, along with 100 armed civilians and some soldiers from nearby forts R√©my, Rolland and La Pr√©sentation, to march against the Iroquois. They defended some of the fleeing colonists from their Mohawk pursuers, but just prior to reaching Lachine, the armed forces were recalled to Fort Rolland by order of Governor Denonville. He was trying to pacify the local Iroquois inhabitants. Governor Denonville had 700 soldiers at his disposal within the Montreal barracks, and might have overtaken the Iroquois forces. He decided to follow a diplomatic route. Numerous attacks from both sides followed, but none were fatal, and the two groups quickly realized the futility of their attempts to drive the other out. In February 1690, the French began peace negotiations with the Iroquois. The French returned captured natives in exchange for the beginnings of peace talks. Through the 1690s, there were no major French or native raids and, even against the will of the English, peace talks continued. This time of relative peace eventually led to the Montreal Treaty of 1701, by which the Iroquois promised to remain neutral in case of war between the French and English. Following the events at Lachine, Denonville was recalled to France for matters unrelated to the massacre,; and Louis de Buade de Frontenac took over governorship of Montreal in October. Frontenac launched raids of vengeance against the English colonists to the south \\"in Canadien style\\" by attacking during the winter months of 1690, including the Schenectady massacre.; Historical accounts According to historian Jean- Francois Lozier, the factors influencing the course of war and peace throughout the region of New-France were not exclusive to the relations between the French and Iroquois, or those between the French and British crowns. A number of factors provide context for the Lachine Massacre. Sources of information regarding victims of the Iroquois in New France are the writings of Jesuit priests; the state registry of parishes in Quebec, Trois- Rivieres, and Montreal; letters written by Marie Guyart (French: M√®re Marie de l'Incarnation); and the writings of Samuel Champlain. However, the accuracy of these sources and reports varies. For instance, in the town of Trois-Rivieres, approximately one third of deaths attributed to the Iroquois are missing names. According to Canadian historian John A. Dickinson, although the cruelty of the Iroquois was real, their threat was neither as constant nor terrible as the sources of the time represented, but they were feeling under siege. European accounts of the Lachine massacre come from two primary sources, survivors of the attack, and Catholic missionaries in the area. Initial reports inflated the Lachine death toll significantly. Colby arrived at the total number of dead, 24, by examining Catholic parish registers before and after the attack. French Catholic accounts of the attack were recorded. Fran√ßois Vachon de Belmont, the fifth superior of the Sulpicians of Montreal, wrote in his History of Canada: Surviving prisoners of the Lachine massacre reported that 48 of their colleagues were tortured, burned and eaten shortly after being taken captive. Further, many survivors showed evidence of ritual torture and recounted their experiences.Following the attack, the French colonists retrieved many English-made weapons which the Mohawk had left behind in their retreat from the island. The evidence of English arming the Mohawk incited a long-standing hatred of the English colonists of New York and demands for revenge. Iroquois accounts of the attack have not been recovered, as they were recounted in oral histories. French sources reported that only three of the attackers were killed. Because all written accounts of the attack were by the French victims, their reports of cannibalism and parents being forced to throw their children onto burning fires may be exaggerated or apocryphal. At the same time, the Mohawk and Iroquois used ritual torture after warfare, sometimes to honor the bravery of enemy warriors. It was common practice among native tribes at the time.

It was not a single clash but consisted of a series of encounters over a number of days. The German crusader forces of Conrad III were defeated by the Seljuk Turks led by Sultan Mesud I. Background Following escalating friction between the Byzantine Empire and the German crusader army, including armed clashes, the Germans were ferried from the environs of Constantinople to the Asiatic shores of the Bosphorus. With inadequate supplies, the crusaders moved into the interior of Anatolia, intending to take the overland route to the Holy Land.Phillips, pp. 176-177 Running battle As the crusaders crossed into the Anatolian plateau they entered an area of debatable frontier districts between the Byzantines and Seljuk Turks. Once beyond effective Byzantine control, the German army came under constant harassing attacks from the Turks, who excelled at such tactics. The poorer, and less well-supplied, infantry of the crusader army were the most vulnerable to hit-and-run horse archer attack and began to take casualties and lose men to capture. The area through which the crusaders were marching was largely barren and parched; therefore the army could not augment its supplies and was troubled by thirst. When the Germans were about three days march beyond Dorylaeum, the nobility requested that the army turn back and regroup. As the crusaders began their retreat, on 25 October, the Turkish attacks intensified and order broke down, the retreat then becoming a rout. Conrad, himself, was wounded by arrows during the retreat.Phillips, pp. 178-181Nicolle, p. 47 Aftermath and estimation of crusader losses On regaining lands under firm Byzantine control Turkish attacks ceased. The failure of the crusaders was partly blamed on Byzantine treachery by the contemporary chronicler William of Tyre, the Greek guides and local population were accused of being in league with the Seljuks. However, convincing evidence or motivation for this scenario is lacking. German losses are difficult to estimate, William of Tyre stating that only a remnant of the army was left. Of the 113 named men in the army, 22 are recorded to have died on the crusade, 42 to have survived and 49 unaccounted for. Though these would have been of the knightly and noble class, and therefore more likely to survive being better armoured and provisioned than the infantry, the idea of the German army being completely destroyed near Dorylaeum is untenable. The Germans subsequently joined forces with the French crusaders, led by Louis VII of France, at Nicaea, before proceeding along the coastal route around western Anatolia. The joint forces came under renewed Seljuk attack, and Conrad and the elite of his force took ship at Ephesus. Conrad returned by sea to Constantinople, where he was reconciled with the Byzantine emperor Manuel I Komnenos. The remainder of the German crusaders, in company with the French, moved on to Attalia, some were then shipped to Antioch. Of those who attempted the overland route to Antioch there is no accurate record of the number of survivors. Manuel I later provided ships to take Conrad and his entourage to Palestine. The Second Crusade eventually failed in its attempt to take the city of Damascus.Phillips, pp. 182-184Nicolle, pp. 50-54 References Bibliography Phillips, J.

This preserves a record of the Earth's magnetic field at the time the mineral was laid down as sediment or crystallized in magma and also the tectonic movement of the rock over millions of years from its original position. Natural remanent magnetization forms the basis of paleomagnetism and magnetostratigraphy.  Types  There are several kinds of NRM that can occur in a sample. Many samples have more than one kind superimposed. Thermoremanent magnetization (TRM) is acquired during cooling through the Curie temperature of the magnetic minerals and is the best source of information on the past Earth's field. Magnetization formed by phase change, chemical action or growth of crystals at low temperature is called chemical remanent magnetization. Sediments acquire a depositional remanent magnetization during their formation or a post-depositional remanent magnetization afterwards. Some kinds of remanence are undesirable and must be removed before the useful remanence is measured. One is isothermal remanent magnetization (IRM), which as a component of NRM induced through exposing a particle to a large magnetic field, causing the field to flip its lower coercivity magnetic moments to a field-favored direction. A commonly cited mechanism of IRM acquisition is through lightning strikes. Another is viscous remanent magnetization (VRM), a remanence acquired when the rock sits in the Earth's field for long periods. The most important component of remanence is acquired when a rock is formed. This is called its primary component or characteristic remanent magnetization (ChRM). Any later component is called a secondary component. To separate these components, the NRM is stripped away in a stepwise manner using thermal or alternating field demagnetization techniques to reveal the characteristic magnetic component.

Spear 2002 pages 58-61 Dr. Fred Rosner, an authority on Jewish medical ethics, has expressed doubt that prayer could ever be subject to empirical analysis. Basic philosophical issues inform the question as to whether prayer is efficacious, for example, whether statistical inference and falsifiability inform what it means to \\"prove\\" or \\"disprove\\" something, and the problem of demarcation, i.e., as to whether this topic is even within the realm of science at all. According to the Washington Post, \\"...prayer is the most common complement to mainstream medicine, far outpacing acupuncture, herbs, vitamins and other alternative remedies.\\" In comparison to other fields that have been scientifically studied, carefully monitored studies of prayer are relatively few. The field remains tiny, with about $5 million spent worldwide on such research each year. Studies of intercessory prayer First person studies aymara woman praying Studies can verify that those who pray are affected by the experience, including certain physiological outcomes. An example of a study on meditative prayer was the Bernardi study in the British Medical Journal in 2001. It reported that by praying the rosary or reciting yoga mantras at specific rates, baroreflex sensitivity increased significantly in cardiovascular patients. A study published in 2008 used Eysenck's dimensional model of personality based on neuroticism and psychoticism to assess the mental health of high school students based on their self-reported frequency of prayer. For students both in Catholic and Protestant schools, higher levels of prayer were associated with better mental health as measured by lower psychoticism scores. However, among pupils attending Catholic schools, higher levels of prayer were also associated with higher neuroticism scores. Lourdes: hoping for a miracle It has also been suggested that if a person knows that he or she is being prayed for it can be uplifting and increase morale, thus aiding recovery. (See Subject-expectancy effect.) Studies have suggested that prayer can reduce psychological stress, regardless of the god or gods a person prays to, a result that is consistent with a variety of hypotheses as to what may cause such an effect. According to a study by CentraState Healthcare System, \\"the psychological benefits of prayer may help reduce stress and anxiety, promote a more positive outlook, and strengthen the will to live.\\"Mind and Spirit from the Health Library section of CentraState Healthcare System. Accessed May 18, 2006. Other practices such as Yoga, T'ai chi, and Meditation may also have a positive impact on physical and psychological health. A 2001 study by Meisenhelder and Chandler analyzed data obtained from 1,421 Presbyterian pastors surveyed by mail and found that their self-reported frequency of prayer was well- correlated with their self-perception of health and vitality. This research methodology has inherent problems with self-selection, selection bias, and residual confounding, and the authors admitted that the direction of perceived prayer and health relationships \\"remains inconclusive due to the limits of the correlational research design\\". Third party studies Various controlled studies have addressed the topic of the efficacy of prayer at least since Francis Galton in 1872. Carefully monitored studies of prayer are relatively scarce with $5 million spent worldwide on such research each year. The largest study, from the 2006 STEP project, found no significant differences in patients recovering from heart surgery whether the patients were prayed for or not. Realized religion: research on the relationship between religion and health Theodore J. Chamberlain, Christopher Alan Hall 2007 pages 33-35 The third party studies reported either null results, correlated results, or contradictory results in which beneficiaries of prayer had worsened health outcomes. For instance, a meta-analysis of several studies related to distant intercessory healing published in the Annals of Internal Medicine in 2000 looked at 2774 patients in 23 studies, and found that 13 studies showed statistically significant positive results, 9 studies showed no effect, and 1 study showed a negative result.John A. Astin, et al. The Efficacy of \\"Distant Healing\\" A Systematic Review of Randomized Trials Annals of Internal Medicine June 6, 2000 vol. 132 no. 11 903-910 A 2003 levels of evidence review found evidence for the hypothesis that \\"Being prayed for improves physical recovery from acute illness\\". It concluded that although \\"a number of studies\\" have tested this hypothesis, \\"only three have sufficient rigor for review here\\" (Byrd 1988, Harris et al. 1999, and Sicher et al. 1998). In all three, \\"the strongest findings were for the variables that were evaluated most subjectively\\", raising concerns about the possible inadvertent unmasking of the outcomes' assessors. Other meta-studies of the broader literature have been performed showing evidence only for no effect or a potentially small effect. For instance, a 2006 meta analysis on 14 studies concluded that there is \\"no discernible effect\\" while a 2007 systemic review of intercessory prayer reported inconclusive results, noting that 7 of 17 studies had \\"small, but significant, effect sizes\\" but the review noted that the three most methodologically rigorous studies failed to produce significant findings. Belief and skepticism Medical views Most scientists dismiss \\"faith healing\\" practitioners.See also: Some opponents of the pseudoscience assert that faith healing makes no scientific claims and thus should be treated as a matter of faith that is not testable by science. Critics reply that claims of medical cures should be tested scientifically because, although faith in the supernatural is not in itself usually considered to be the purview of science, Re-published in claims of reproducible effects are nevertheless subject to scientific investigation. Scientists and doctors generally find that faith healing lacks biological plausibility or epistemic warrant, which is one of the criteria used to judge whether clinical research is ethical and financially justified. A Cochrane review of intercessory prayer found \\"although some of the results of individual studies suggest a positive effect of intercessory prayer, the majority do not\\". The authors concluded: \\"We are not convinced that further trials of this intervention should be undertaken and would prefer to see any resources available for such a trial used to investigate other questions in health care\\". An article in the Medical Journal of Australia says that \\"One common criticism of prayer research is that prayer has become a popular therapeutic method for which there is no known plausible mechanism.\\" Medical professionals are skeptical of new claims by studies until they have been experimentally reproduced and corroborated. For instance, a 2001 study by researchers associated with Columbia University has been associated with controversy, following claims of success in the popular media.Skeptical Inquirer , Sept/Oct 2004 Reproductive Medicine Nov 2004 Although different medical studies have been at odds with one another, physicians have not stopped studying prayer. This may be partly because prayer is increasingly used as a coping mechanism for patients. Skepticism on scope of prayer A family at prayer In a debate/interview in Newsweek with Christian evangelical Rick Warren, atheist Sam Harris commented that most lay perceptions of the efficacy of prayer (personal impressions as opposed to empirical studies) were related to sampling error because \\"we know that humans have a terrible sense of probability.\\" That is, humans are more inclined to recognize confirmations of their faith than they are to recognize disconfirmations. Harris also criticized existing empirical studies for limiting themselves to prayers for relatively unmiraculous events, such as recovery from heart surgery. He suggested a simple experiment to settle the issue: > Get a billion Christians to pray for a single amputee. Get them to pray that > God regrow that missing limb. This happens to salamanders every day, > presumably without prayer; this is within the capacity of God. I find it > interesting that people of faith only tend to pray for conditions that are > self-limiting.'The God Debate' by Sam Harris, Rick Warren, Newsweek - > RichardDawkins.net Within Christian teachings, the comment by Harris regarding what he called the self-limiting nature of prayer had been addressed years before by multiple authors. For instance, in the 19th century William Peabody discussed the efficacy of prayer in the face of what he called the immutability of the laws of nature. He said: William Bourn Oliver Peabody, Efficacy of prayer, in \\"Sermons\\" B.H. Greene Press, Boston, 1849, pages 252-255 > Night follows day, and day night. The seasons preserve their succession. > ...We may not hope to suspend their operation by our prayers. ...And yet > notwithstanding all of this, we hold in an undoubting faith the doctrine of > the efficacy of our prayers, or to use the language of another, \\"of an > influence from above as diversified and unceasing as are the requests from > below\\". Peabody then argued at length that prayers may have efficacy in a form that does not interfere with the arrangement of the laws of nature, and that God may respond in ways that are not anticipated, without changing the arrangement of nature. George Burnap echoed the same concept when he wrote:George Burnap, The efficacy of prayer in \\"Christianity, its essence and evidence\\" Crosby, Nichols and Co. Boston, 1855 page 171 > God governs the universe by fixed and uniform laws, not only for the sake of > order, but for human good. ...The fulfillment of every human desire would > break up this order, and bring everything into disorder and confusion. Religious and philosophical issues Madonna of the Rosary, by Caravaggio, 1606-1607 Religious and philosophical objections to the very study of prayer's efficacy exist. Some interpret Deuteronomy (6:16 \\"You shall not put the Lord your God to the test\\") to mean that prayer cannot, or should not, be examined. The religious viewpoint objects to the claim that prayer is susceptible to experimental designs or statistical analysis, and other assumptions in many experiments, e.g. that a thousand prayers are statistically different from one. The objections also include the complaint that religion generally deals with unique, uncontrollable events; statistics, and science in general, deal with recurring phenomena which are possible to sample or control and are susceptible to general laws. Religious objections also include the complaint that as prayer starts to be measured, it is no longer real prayer once it gets involved in an experiment and that the concept of conducting prayer experiments reflects a misunderstanding of the purpose of prayer. The 2006 STEP experiment indicated that some of the intercessors who took part in it complained about the scripted nature of the prayers that were imposed to them, saying that this is not the way they usually conduct prayer: With respect to expectation of a response to prayer, the 18th-century philosopher William Paley wrote:William Paley, 1835, Paley's moral and political philosophy Uriah Hunt Press, Philadelphia page 157 > To pray for particular favors is to dictate to Divine Wisdom, and savors of > presumption; and to intercede for other individuals or for nations, is to > presume that their happiness depends upon our choice, and that the > prosperity of communities hangs upon our interest. During the 20th-century, philosopher Bertrand Russell believed that religion and science \\"have long been at war, claiming for themselves the same territory, ideas and allegiances\\". And Russell believed that the war had been decisively won by science.Bertrand Russell, Religion and science Oxford University Press, 1997 page xi Almost 40 years earlier, a 22-year-old Russell also wrote: \\"For although I had long ceased to believe in the efficacy of prayer, I was so lonely and so in need of some supporter such as the Christian God, that I took to saying prayers again when I ceased to believe in their efficacy.\\"Bertrand Russell, The Collected Papers of Bertrand Russell: Cambridge Essays Published by Routledge, 1983 The 21st-century evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins, describing how Richard Swinburne explained away the STEP experiment's negative results \\"on the grounds that God answers prayers only if they are offered up for good reasons\\",Richard Swinburne, Response to a Statistical Study of the Effect of Petitionary Prayer, originally in Science and Theology News 2006. finds one predictable result of prayer: > Other theologians joined NOMA-inspired sceptics in contending that studying > prayer in this way is a waste of money because supernatural influences are > by definition beyond the reach of science.

Attending such events fall into categories of networking, protocol, information gathering, among others. Networking may involve an economic network, an entrepreneurial network, an old boy network, a social network, and a value network. Protocol deals with etiquette and other forms of intercultural competence that should be followed to show respect for those with whom one is networking. Information may be gained as a message, a pattern, or an input. Attending events with official purposes helps one build an augmented social network, a community of practice, and a network of practice.

It is an adaptation of the 1956 novel of the same name by William Brinkley. Glenn Ford and Gia Scala star. This is the first of several service comedies that Ford appeared in after the huge success of Teahouse of the August Moon. The movie was very successful and further solidified Ford's reputation as an adept comedic actor. Plot Holliman and Francis in a publicity still Lieutenant (j.g.) Max Siegel (Glenn Ford) and other US Navy personnel are stuck in a public relations unit far from the fighting. Lieutenant Commander Clinton T. Nash (Fred Clark), their commanding officer and a stockbroker in civilian life, refuses to allow anyone to transfer out. Much of Siegel's time is spent showing war correspondents (like obnoxious Gordon Ripwell (Keenan Wynn)) and visiting Congressmen around the island. One day, Siegel spots beautiful local schoolteacher Melora Alba (Gia Scala). Despite some formidable obstacles, he eventually wins her love. However, they break up when he wants to live in New York City to further his career, while she feels she is needed on the island. Meanwhile, Siegel's yeoman, Adam Garrett (Earl Holliman), falls in love with Navy nurse Alice Tomlen (Anne Francis), which constitutes a serious breach of Navy regulations, as Tomlen is an officer while Garrett is only an enlisted man. However, Siegel pretends to be dating her himself in order to give Garrett the opportunity to spend time with her. This couple also fall in love. When Nash finds out, Siegel suggests a fitting punishment would be a transfer to a fighting unit (something Garrett very much wants). With the Army hogging the news headlines, Nash comes up with the idea to take an ordinary sailor and send him on a morale-boosting tour, all highly publicized. He chooses Farragut Jones (Mickey Shaughnessy) (a fine naval name). Unfortunately, Jones turns out to be foul-mouthed and heavily tattooed, not exactly what Nash had hoped for. He assigns Siegel to smooth out Jones's rough edges, with limited success. Later, Siegel has to escort another war correspondent, the shapely and blonde Deborah Aldrich (Eva Gabor), when she finagles her way aboard a heavy cruiser on its way to a combat operation, much to Admiral Junius Boatwright's (Howard Smith) disapproval. With the end of the war, Siegel realizes that he cannot live without Melora, and decides to remain on the island. Cast * Glenn Ford as Lieutenant (j.g.)

The first known depiction of a karahafu appears on a miniature shrine (zushi) in Sh≈çryoin shrine at H≈çry≈´-ji in Nara. The karahafu and its building style (karahafu-zukuri) became increasingly popular during the Kamakura and Muromachi period, when Japan witnessed a new wave of influences from the Asian continent. During the Kamakura period, Zen Buddhism spread to Japan and the karahafu was employed in many Zen temples. Initially, the karahafu was used only in temples and aristocratic gateways, but starting from the beginning of the Azuchi‚ÄìMomoyama period, it became an important architectural element in the construction of a daimy≈çs mansions and castles. The daimy≈ç's gateway with a karahafu roof was reserved for the sh≈çgun during his onari visits to the retainer, or for the reception of the emperor at shogunate establishments. A structure associated with these social connections naturally imparted special meaning.Sarvimaki: Structures, Symbols and Meanings (2000), 18/2000, 82‚Äì84, 178.

Part of its area is preserved as the Cowell Lime Works Historic District, which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007. In addition to the four lime kilns, cooperage and other features relating to lime manufacture, the Historic District also includes other structures associated with the Cowell Ranch, including barns, a blacksmith shop, ranch house, cook house and workers' cabins. The 32-acre (130,000 m2) Historic District is located within the University of California, Santa Cruz campus, to either side of the main campus entrance. The site gets its name from the Cowell family, which owned and operated the lime works, quarries, ranch and large tracts of surrounding timber lands. Industrialist Henry Cowell acquired the ranch and the lime works in the late 19th century. He and his descendants remained owners of the ranch until the death of S. H. (Harry) Cowell, youngest of Henry's five children and last surviving member of the family, in 1955. Cowell's vast estate went to the S. H. Cowell Foundation, still in existence today. The Foundation sold part of the ranch property to the University of California for the creation of the new UC Santa Cruz campus, which opened in 1965. Several of the original ranch buildings have been renovated into university offices. The university's Women's Center is hosted at the Cardiff House, formerly the residence of ranch manager George H. Cardiff. The Cowell Lime Works is just one of many former lime-making sites scattered around north-western Santa Cruz County. Other sites featuring old lime kilns and quarries can be seen in the Fall Creek Unit of Henry Cowell Redwoods State Park, Wilder Ranch State Park and PogonipCity of Santa Cruz parks - Pogonip (a Santa Cruz greenbelt area). History The lime works was originally developed, in the early 1850s, by partners Isaac E. Davis and Albion P. Jordan. Two of the thousands drawn to California by the discovery of gold, both arrived in San Francisco in 1849.Perry, p.63 They met during the next couple of years, and concluded that lime manufacturing offered more opportunities than gold mining. The rapid population growth in northern California at this time greatly increased demand for lime, used to make mortar for the new brick buildings. The partners came to Santa Cruz around 1853, where they found an abundance of high-quality limestone and proximity to shipping facilities. The firm of Davis and Jordan leased some of the future Cowell ranch property, began quarrying operations, built lime kilns, a cooperage, ranch house, and other structures, and began shipping lime in late 1853. They built a new road (present day Bay Street) between the kilns and the wharf, which descended to Monterey Bay from the bluffs near the famous Santa Cruz surf spot known as Steamer Lane. Their success soon allowed them to buy the lime works land and the wharf they used for shipping. In 1856, they built a new longer wharf and a second ship. About this time, Davis moved to San Francisco, where the company established a sales office and warehouse facilities. Jordan stayed in Santa Cruz to oversee that end of the business.Perry, p.64 In the next decade, Jordan's health began to decline, and he sold his half of the company to Henry Cowell in 1865. With the firm renamed Davis and Cowell, Henry Cowell and his family moved to Santa Cruz, where he took over Jordan's former duties. After Davis died in 1888, Cowell acquired full ownership of the company, and it became Henry Cowell and Co. Operations and land acquisitions continued to expand over the next twenty years; encompassing expanded lime production, cattle and milk cows, bituminous rock mining, tan oak bark (used in leather tanning), grain and fruit. In 1898, the company incorporated as the Henry Cowell Lime and Cement Company. The transition to Portland cement, which could be used to manufacture mortar superior to lime-based mortar, began the decline of the lime industry after the start of the 20th century. Henry Cowell's son Harry finally shut down the Bay Street kilns in about 1920.Perry, p.76 By the time UC Santa Cruz opened in 1965, many of the mostly wooden lime works structures had been unoccupied for over twenty years and were in poor condition. The ranch buildings were in better shape, having been used into the 1950s. The university began to renovate some of these and adapt them for campus uses. A horse barn became the Barn Theater in 1968; the cookhouse became the admissions office; the blacksmith shop became an art studio, the ranch house (Cardiff House) houses the university's Women's Center, and so on. Lime Works restoration The continued deterioration of the unused structures prompted local citizens and the university staff to launch an effort to restore and preserve them. An organization called the Friends of the Cowell Lime Works Historic District was established to help achieve these goals. The Friends, whose members include faculty, staff, students, alumni, and members of the general public, have stabilized the cooperage structure, conducted archaeological studies of the site, and begun restoration of six workers' cabins. A self-guided walking tour brochure is available on their website.

Playing career Early career Born in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, he started his career with Todds Nook, and then Gateshead NER, two local non-league sides where he first acquired his nickname, \\"Tadger\\", by which he was affectionately known throughout his career. Sheffield Wednesday In May 1902, he was snapped up by Sheffield Wednesday and made one appearance in their championship winning side of 1902‚Äì03. The following season he was a more regular selection, making ten appearances as Wednesday retained their title. In 1905‚Äì06 he was Wednesday's top scorer with a total of 22 goals (20 league and 2 cup). The following season, he was part of the Wednesday team that reached the FA Cup Final against the previous year's winners, Everton. In the match at Crystal Palace Stadium on 20 April 1907 a mix-up in the Everton defence enabled Wednesday to take a twentieth-minute lead as Harry Chapman swung the ball into the goalmouth for Stewart to give it the final touch. Everton equalised through Jack Sharp in the closing minute of the first half, but with only four minutes of the match remaining, Andrew Wilson, the Wednesday centre-forward, received the ball from a throw-in and hooked it across the goalmouth for George Simpson, his outside-left, to head home one of the softest goals imaginable. He made his first appearance for England against Wales on 18 March 1907 scoring England's goal in a 1‚Äì1 draw. His next England appearance, against Scotland on 6 April also ended 1‚Äì1. In August 1908, he moved back to Tyneside to join Newcastle United. During his six years at Wednesday he made a total of 141 appearances with 59 goals. Newcastle United At St James' Park he soon became one of the stars of \\"The Edwardian Masters\\", as Newcastle were known at the time due to the superb attacking, flowing and skilful way they played. He was an integral part of the team, alongside fellow internationals Colin Veitch, Jock Rutherford, Jimmy Lawrence and Albert Shepherd, which won the Football League championship in 1908‚Äì09, making 25 appearances and contributing eight goals. In the FA Cup semi-final against Swindon Town on 26 March 1910, he scored the opening goal in a 2‚Äì0 victory but was unable to make the team for the final against Barnsley, which Newcastle won after a replay, thus taking the cup for the first time. In 1911, he played in the losing side in the final against Bradford City. He made his third, and final, England appearance against Scotland on 1 April 1911 and again scored in a 1‚Äì1 draw. All three of his international appearances thus ended 1‚Äì1. He continued to be a regular member of the Newcastle side until he was sold to Rangers in 1913 for ¬£600. In his Newcastle career he made a total of 138 appearances with 53 goals. Later career In May 1914 he returned to his native north-east, and non-League football, with North Shields Athletic where he became team manager. He was then living in Gateshead, and working as a commercial traveller. He served in the Royal Garrison Artillery during the First World War.

The rebel victory assured an open line of march for the fleeing governor and Missouri State Guard away from Lyon's force in Boonville. Background On June 15, 1861, Union Brigadier General Nathaniel Lyon took control of the Missouri capitol in Jefferson City. Two days later, he routed the portion of the Missouri State Guard then assembling at Boonville with pro-secession Missouri Governor Claiborne F. Jackson. As the portion of the guard accompanying Governor Jackson fled to the southwest of the state, a Unionist Missouri Home Guard regiment was in position to obstruct his retreat. The majority of the inhabitants of Benton County were of Southern origin and had pro-Confederate, pro-slavery sentiment; however, the German immigrants and their descendants were predominantly pro- Union and anti-slavery. These formed the core of the Benton County Home Guard. Captain Abel H. W. Cook began to form the regiment in early June and called for the volunteers to assemble northeast of Cole Camp on June 11. A secessionist force was gathering nearby at Warsaw. Captain Walter S. O'Kane organized the Warsaw \\"Grays\\" and Captain Thomas W. Murray organized the \\"Blues.\\" The combined force numbered about 350, with 100 of them mounted.Cole Camp Community (1989), p. 183. Two weeks after Cole Camp, just before the Battle of Carthage, O'Kane was elected lieutenant colonel of the battalion while Murray was elected major. The secessionists were aided by Benton County's Sheriff, Bartholomew W. Keown. Keown attempted to arrest captains Cook and Mitchell at the Union Home Guard camp, but they refused to comply. The \\"arrest\\" apparently was a pretense for gathering intelligence.Cole Camp Community (1989), p. 184. The engagement The Unionist force occupied two adjoining farms ~600 yards apart belonging to Henry Harms and John Heisterberg. The Home Guards called the location Camp Lyon. Cook had about 400 infantry muskets. While up to 900 men had initially gathered, as many as half were furloughed for lack of weapons or for other reasons.Cole Camp Community (1989), pp. 181-3. O'Kane's force marched from Warsaw toward Cole Camp on June 18 to attack the gathering Home Guard. A respected older citizen, John Tyree, had witnessed the preparations of the secessionists and reported it to the officers at Camp Lyon. As he returned from reporting this, he was captured by O'Kane's force. Some of the men recognized him from earlier in the day, surmised what he had done, tied him to a tree and shot him. (Although a slaveholder, Tyree was a Union man.)Cole Camp Community (1989), p. 185. Despite Tyree's warning, Cook's preparations were inadequate, for his pickets were overrun without alerting the sleeping Home Guard. There were admissions of heavy drinking in the camp and the men were slumbering in the early morning hours of June 19 when the attack began. O'Kane's infantry double-quicked from the east to the Heisterberg barn where a portion of the Home Guard were and delivered a volley into the shocked men. However, a company of the Home Guard under Captain Elsinger was just north of the barn. They responded with fire into the flank of the attackers, but having little ammunition were soon forced to withdraw. O'Kane's mounted force then slammed into and drove away another nearby group of Home Guard that was attempting to form to repel the infantry. Meanwhile, the remaining unengaged Union men at the Harms barn under Captains Grother and Mueller formed to join the fracas. The presence of a Union flag now in the hands of the rebels confused the men and they held their fire until they were fired upon. They withdrew without engaging and the fighting ended. Capt. Cook supposedly fled at the beginning of the fight. He claimed to have left to consult with Captain Totten of Lyon's forces, but his men claimed otherwise, and Henry Imhauser was elected commander in July. The regiment disbanded in September, and in November, Cook was \\"shot by rebels\\" in Henry County. His widow was denied a pension because Cook \\"was not in U.S. service at time of death.\\" Walter S. O'Kane subsequently served as Aide-de-Camp, 8th Confederate Cavalry Division, and died 1908 in Arkansas.Cole Camp Community (1989), pp. 186-9. Casualties and impact Federal casualties were heavy with at least 34 killed or mortally wounded, 60 wounded, and 25 made prisoner. Perhaps most importantly, O'Kane's force captured 362 muskets with bayonets that would prove useful at the battles of Carthage and Wilson's Creek. Secessionist losses were around 7 killed and 25 wounded.Cole Camp Community (1989), p. 190. Former Confederate President Jefferson Davis, in his 1890 book A Short History of the Confederate States of America, claimed that 206 Union soldiers were killed and wounded, and over 100 taken prisoner. O'Kane's men apparently murdered one of the prisoners who spoke little English and was a cook. They mistook him for Capt. Cook and shot him on the spot.Cole Camp Community (1989), p. 290. The victory opened a path for the fleeing Missouri State Guard. When O'Kane's men joined the gathering Missouri State Guard, their tale provided a morale boost to the rest of the beleaguered force. Sheriff Keown was captured along with 683 other Missouri State Guard recruits on December 19 in the Skirmish at Blackwater Creek. As a result of his actions at Cole Camp and in another affair, he was charged with spying and with robbing loyal citizens, but died in prison on April 16, 1862 before a trial was held.Cole Camp Community (1989), pp. 183-4.

Chabad niggunim were either composed or taught by the Rebbe of Chabad or their Hassidim.Heichal Neginah Niggunim are used to aid for meditation during Chasidic prayer or Torah study, as well as during farbrengens.A Collection of Chabad Niggunim (Melodies) some of these ancient Chabad melodies have recently made their way into mainstream music.Chasidic Tunes Inspire Rockers - News The Chabad style of niggun Chabad niggunim are admired across Hasidism for their intellectual content, expressing the aim in Chabad to investigate Hasidic philosophy using the mind as the route to the heart. The second Rebbe, Dovber Schneuri, distinguished between mainstream Hasidic emotional \\"enthusiasm\\" in worship, that is fostered outwards, and the Chabad ideal of inwardly created \\"ecstasy\\". His \\"Tract on Ecstasy\\", an unusually personal mystical account in Judaism, guides the follower in the meditative stages of the Chabad approach to Dveikus (fervour). In this ideal, ecstasy is an inner emotional expression, and can remain concealed in the warmth of the heart. In Chabad terminology, the aim of this is to reach \\"Pnimius\\" (inward Ohr) over \\"Hitzonius\\" (outward light). The fundamental Chabad text, the Tanya, articulates this method in Jewish meditation of \\"hisbonenus\\" (contemplative understanding). In classic Chabad thought, externally inspired emotional worship is considered a distracting path from deeper content, though this idealistic aim requires time to contemplate that may not always be available. In the present generation, more emphasis has been given in Chabad to outreach, though the classic ideal is venerated in legendary accounts of Hasidim, told in Farbrengen gatherings. Chabad Rebbes told of two characteristic categories of follower, the \\"Oveid\\" who seeks practical Divine \\"service\\" from their mystical inspiration, and the \\"Maskil\\" whose first aim is deeper understanding of Hasidic thought. The average person can combine both archetypes in their daily life. Some Chabad niggunim are more suited to moments of inward contemplation, and others celebrate and inspire outward fulfillment. One renowned story both cautions against mixing the two necessary aspects, and also playfully recommends not to be overly concerned by their overlap: > A well known Hasid was filling out the company accounts at work. In the > final tally, he answered the question of total outcome with the Hasidic > aphorism that \\"Ein Od Milvado\\"! This means, \\"There is nothing outside of > God\\", as in Chabad Divine Unity means only God truly exists. His fellow > Hasid reprimanded his mixing of Hasidic and secular life. He replied that in > prayer, people are not usually upset by their minds being diverted in > secular thoughts. So, he concluded, it isn't so bad for holy thoughts to > intrude in Worldly matters! In Hasidic terminology, meditative dveikus niggunim correspond to \\"Lower Teshuvah\\" (Lower Return to God), and celebratory joyful niggunim to \\"Higher Teshuvah\\" (Higher Return). In Hasidic philosophy, such as explained in the third section of the Tanya, Teshuvah does not only involve repentance and rectification of previous spiritual faults. Rather, as the Baal Shem Tov taught, even perfectly righteous Tzadikim should return to God, in the higher Teshuvah of continual ascent in holiness. According to Kabbalistic exegesis of the Hebrew word \\"Teshuvah\\" (◊™◊©◊ï◊ë◊î), it means \\"Returning the letter hei\\" (◊™◊©◊ï◊ë-◊î). The Tetragrammaton Divine name has two letters \\"hei\\", the second one corresponding to the lower revealed levels of the Four Worlds, and the first one corresponding to the higher concealed realms. Lower teshuvah returns the second hei in rectification, higher teshuvah redeems the higher hei in holy ascent. The seventh Rebbe of Chabad taught that the main focus of our generation is in the \\"Higher Teshuvah\\". Accordingly, while the main niggunim of the previous Chabad Rebbes were meditative, many of the niggunim of the seventh Rebbe are joyful outward expressions. Chronological list of Chabad niggunim On auspicious days in the Jewish calendar, the main niggun of each Rebbe is sung in Hasidic gatherings in successive order. This can take place on 19 Kislev, the last day of Passover or at the close of Shavuot.

Harefield's sister hospital is the Royal Brompton Hospital in Chelsea. History The first hospital on the site was the No. 1 Australian Auxiliary Hospital established during the First World War to treat injured Australians and New Zealander soldiers. After the war Middlesex County Council decided to use the site to build a series of single-storey pavilions which opened as the Harefield Sanatorium in October 1921. Work started on a more permanent structure in 1935 and the new building was opened on 8 October 1937 by the Duke of Gloucester, with many of the wards featuring large open areas to give patients access to the fresh air. The hospital joined the National Health Service in 1948. Amongst the hospital's roll call of distinguished cardiologists were Paul Wood and Walter Somerville. Arguably, the hospital's most famous surgeon was Professor Sir Magdi Yacoub, who performed the UK's first heart and lung transplant at Harefield in 1983. Under the leadership of Sir Magdi Yacoub, the Harefield Hospital transplant programme had begun in 1980 and by the end of the decade he and his team had performed one thousand of the procedures, while the hospital had become the leading UK transplant centre. In a January 2008 press release, the trust announced that Harefield Hospital had become the leader in the south east of England for treating acute heart attack patients with primary angioplasty and coronary stent insertion to reduce the length of hospital stays. In the 2010 staff survey conducted by the Care Quality Commission, one staff member in five (of those who responded to the survey ) reported having been the subject of discrimination and one in fifty having been assaulted at work by a fellow staff member. However, \\"only a minority of staff said they felt work pressures, with four fifths of employees adding they would recommend the trust as a place to work or receive treatment.\\" Facilities The hospital advertises as being \\"one of the largest and most experienced centres in the world for heart and lung transplants\\" and having \\"jointly pioneered work in the development of 'artificial hearts' (also known as left ventricular assist devices or LVADs)\\".

She led the 1st Destroyer Flotilla from completion until 1912 and was then briefly transferred to the 4th Destroyer Flotilla before the ship was assigned to the 3rd Battle Squadron in 1913. During World War I, Blanche was assigned to several different battleship squadrons of the Grand Fleet. She was present at, but did not fight in, the Battle of Jutland in mid-1916.

J. Fortune. Plot summary Unlike previous adventures, this novel was unique in that Stephen Lane's parents was not away from their New York home during the story, and they knew that Stephen and his uncle Richard Duffy would be away. Richard had received an invitation from an old friend, the Greek Constantine Andropolis, to stay at the Greek's new villa outside Athens. Over dinner, he proposed a week's trip with Stephen, suggesting that it would be helpful to Stephen's history education. As it was school term, Stephen would have to write a field report, but it also meant low season air fares, which persuaded Mr. Lane to agree. When Stephen questioned Richard privately, he was surprised that it was really meant as a pleasure trip and there was no mission awaiting them in Greece. Nonetheless, even before they touched down in Greece, they found their flight hijacked by a gang calling itself Hellenic Alliance to Terminate Exploitation (HATE). Following a daring rescue by Greek authorities when the hijackers forced the plane to land at airport of Iraklion in Crete, the uncle-nephew duo found their rescuer was none other than Constantine, who was supposed to be their host. Richard had conveniently omitted mentioning that Constantine was also head of Interpol dealing with art and artefact smuggling. When Constantine requested them to help him infiltrate a suspicious archaeological project, the uncle-nephew duo could not say no. Constantine had an undercover agent with the project taking place on a fictional uninhabited island named Ionia, made off-limits during the dig. The agent had managed to report treasure was found before radio contact went dead. Richard volunteered to go as an archaeologist to investigate. During their adventure, the uncle- nephew duo were menaced by greedy treasure hunters, terrorists as well as a beautiful but double-dealing woman.

History  The Austin Stars Performing Arts Association (ASPAA), a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, was founded in the fall of 2005 by Brent Unger and Evan Morgan, both alumni of Star of Indiana Drum and Bugle Corps, and Cathy Benford, former board member of Revolution Drum and Bugle Corps with the initial intention of creating an all-age drum and bugle corps in Central Texas. Efforts to form any kind of ensemble in 2006 were postponed when Mr. Morgan, a captain in the U.S. Air Force, was sent to serve in Afghanistan and Mr. Unger toured with the Blue Stars that summer filling in the baritone/euphonium tech position. In the fall of 2006, planning continued for the 2007 season and their first ensemble was a 6-man brass ensemble. Their debut was at the Texas Drum Corps Preview on June 16, 2007. The brass ensemble performed two more times during that summer at Brass Hysteria in Bedford and Brass On The Bayou in Houston. Evan Morgan returned home safely in late July from his tour of duty in Afghanistan. In 2008, the corps grew to 20 members and produced its first ever field show entitled \\"Stars In The Spotlight: On Stage, Screen and Field\\". The corps performed in exhibition at the Texas Drum Corps Preview in Austin, Brass Hysteria in Denton, Brass On The Bayou in Houston and will made its first out-of-state trip to Douglasville, Georgia to perform at DCA Rocks The South. As preparation for the 2009 season was underway, Brent Unger stepped down from the director role and Michael J. Vazquez, the director of independent performing group ATX Winterguard was brought in as acting director. It is also in this year that the Austin Stars DBC chose to fold as an active drum corps. From 2009 to 2013 the primary function of the ASPAA was to support their sole group, ATX Winterguards.

Commissioner, 916 F.2d 110 (3rd Cir. 1990) is a United States Third Circuit Court of Appeals decision concerning the cancellation of debt and the tax consequences for the borrower for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Background Resorts International Hotel & Casino (\\"Resorts\\"), a casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey, granted David Zarin (\\"Zarin\\"), a housing developer and (it would later prove) gambling addict, a credit line of $10,000 in June, 1978.Zarin, 916 F.2d at 111. Pursuant to this arrangement, Zarin could write a check (\\"marker\\") and in return receive chips in order to gamble at the casino's tables; Zarin would almost invariably play craps. Over time Resorts regularly increased his credit line, and by November, 1979, Zarin's permanent line of credit had reached $200,000.Zarin, 916 F.2d at 111-112. The New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement filed with the New Jersey Casino Control Commission a complaint against Resorts in response to allegations of credit abuse. Subsequently, a Casino Control Commissioner issued an Emergency Order which made further credit extensions to Zarin illegal. Nevertheless, Resorts continued to extend Zarin's credit limit. In April, 1980, Zarin delivered personal checks and counterchecks to Resorts which were returned as having been drawn against insufficient funds. Those dishonored checks totaled $3,435,000. In response, Resorts cut off Zarin's credit and filed action in New Jersey state court. Resorts and Zarin settled their dispute for a total of $500,000. The Commissioner subsequently determined deficiencies in Zarin's federal income taxes, arguing that Zarin had recognized $2,935,000 of income in 1981 from the cancellation of indebtedness which resulted from the settlement with Resorts. The Tax Court agreed with the Commissioner. Issues The sole issue before the Court was whether the Tax Court correctly held that Zarin had income from the discharge of his indebtedness.Zarin, 916 F.2d at 112-113.  Holding  Zarin realized no income from the settlement for two reasons.Zarin, 916 F.2d at 117. First, the Federal Income Tax Code provisions covering discharge of debt were inapplicable since the situation failed to meet the definitional requirements of section 108(d)(1). Second, the settlement of Zarin's gambling debts constituted a \\"contested liability.\\" Court's reasoning The court concluded that section 61(a)(12) and section 108 of the Internal Revenue Code set forth the general rule that gross income includes income from the discharge of indebtedness.Zarin, 916 F.2d at 113. However, the court held that neither of those sections applied to the case at hand. Section 108(d)(1), which repeats and further elaborates the rule set forth in section 61(a)(12), defines the term indebtedness as any indebtedness \\"(A) for which the taxpayer is liable, or (B) subject to which the taxpayer holds property.\\" The court held that neither prong of section 108(d)(1) was satisfied in the case, and, as a result, Zarin could not have income from the discharge of his debt. According to the court, the debt was unenforceable as a matter of New Jersey law because of the Emergency Order issued by the New Jersey Casino Control Commission. As a result, the credit line was clearly not debt \\"for which the taxpayer is liable.\\" Furthermore, the Court held that the gambling chips were not property but \\"merely an accounting mechanism to evidence debt.\\" Zarin could not do with the chips as he pleased, nor did the chips have any independent economic value beyond the casino.Zarin, 916 F.2d at 114 Additionally, since Zarin's debt at all times equaled or exceeded the number of chips he possessed, redemption would have left Zarin with no chips or cash. The court concluded that Zarin's indebtedness was not subject to property held by the taxpayer. The court further held that the proper approach to the case was to view it as disputed debt or \\"contested liability.\\"Zarin, 916 F.2d at 115. Under the contested liability doctrine, if a taxpayer, in good faith, disputed the amount of debt, a subsequent settlement would be treated as the amount of debt cognizable for tax purposes. \\"The excess of the original debt over the amount determined to have been due is disregarded for both loss and debt accounting purposes.\\" Following this doctrine, the court concluded that the $500,000 settlement fixed the amount of loss and debt cognizable for tax purposes. Dissent The dissent argued that Zarin held property in the gambling chips issued by Resorts. According to the dissent, Zarin wished to purchase what Resorts was offering in the marketplace, and Resorts provided Zarin with chips instead of cash to entitle him to gamble in Resorts' casino. \\"Zarin received either $3.4 million in cash or an entitlement for which others would have had to pay $3.4 million.\\" Therefore, with the settlement Resorts surrendered its claim to the repayment of the remaining $2.9 million owed by Zarin, and Zarin's assets were freed of that amount and he recognized gross income.  Impact  Under federal income tax, a loan is not gross income to the borrower because the borrower has an obligation to repay the amount received and there is no accession to wealth.Donaldson, Samuel A., Federal Income Taxation of Individuals: Cases, Problems and Materials 111 (2d ed. 2007). Along those same lines, the lender may not deduct the amount of the loan because the loan merely converts one asset (cash) into another asset (a promise of repayment). Furthermore, if the lender forgives or cancels the debt there may be income tax consequences for the borrower.Zarin, 916 F.2d at 112. These general axioms directly affect many taxpayers because millions of individuals across the United States deal with loans and indebtedness. As a result, the principles discussed and analyzed in Zarin v. Commissioner are relevant to any taxpayer concerned with those issues. According to the decision, a cancellation of debt through settlement proceedings, no matter the amount of pre-settlement indebtedness, releases the taxpayer from the debt obligation without creating taxable income. \\"The excess of the original debt over the amount determined to have been due is disregarded for both loss and debt accounting purposes.\\" Critique The Tenth Circuit criticized the Zarin decision in Preslar v. Commissioner, suggesting that the Third Circuit had erred in treating liquidated and unliquidated debts alike. > The problem with the Third Circuit's holding is it treats liquidated and > unliquidated debts alike. The whole theory behind requiring that the amount > of a debt be disputed before the contested liability exception can be > triggered is that only in the context of disputed debts is the Internal > Revenue Service (IRS) unaware of the exact consideration initially exchanged > in a transaction ... The mere fact that a taxpayer challenges the > enforceability of a debt in good faith does not necessarily mean he or she > is shielded from discharge-of-indebtedness income upon resolution of the > dispute. To implicate the contested liability doctrine, the original amount > of the debt must be unliquidated. A total denial of liability is not a > dispute touching upon the amount of the underlying debt.

For admission into Kindergarten, the school follows a joint admission policy together with St Paul's High School, Hyderabad and All Saints High School, Hyderabad, both of which are also run by the Montfort Brothers of St. Gabriel. Every year in January, one of the three schools conducts the admissions procedure for Kindergarten. It involves an interview of student and parents.

The pre-primary and primary divisions are housed in one campus, commonly called the \\"Primary School\\". The Middle school has five sections each of Classes V to VII and the High School has five sections each of Classes VIII to X. Both the Middle school and High School are housed in another building, commonly called the \\"High School Campus\\". The High School Campus and the Primary Campus are near one another on the same road. Exams The academic year starts mid-June and ends in early April and is divided into three quarters. Examinations are held at the end of every quarter and every month. At the end of Class X, the students take the State Government administered Secondary School Certificate Examination.

The term can also refer to the rankings themselves. The document is normally released about two weeks before the tournament begins. On the banzuke wrestlers are divided into East, which is printed on the right, and West, which is printed on the left. Each wrestler's full shikona (ring name), hometown and rank is also listed. The top of the page starts with the highest ranked makuuchi wrestlers printed in the largest characters, down to the wrestlers in the lowest divisions which are written in much smaller characters. The names of gy≈çji (sumo referees), yobidashi (ushers/handymen), shimpan (judges), oyakata (elders of the Japan Sumo Association), and occasionally tokoyama (hairdressers) are also listed. While not as old as sumo itself, the form and production of this document can be traced as far back as 1761, and has been a defining component of sumo for centuries. As is the traditional Japanese style, a banzuke is meant to be read right to left, top to bottom. It is considered a collector's item by sumo fans. Banzuke preparation basho. , issued February 1851 (Kaei 4). The rankings on the banzuke are decided by an assembly composed of 20 sumo judges and three supervisors who gather a few days after each official tournament. The assembly assigns ranks to over 600 wrestlers in six divisions based on their performance in the previous tournament. There are no precise rules for assigning rank, but the general rule is that a wrestler who achieved kachi- koshi (a majority of wins) will be raised in the rankings and a wrestler with a make-koshi (a majority of losses) will be lowered in the rankings. The degree of a wrestler's success or failure will help give the assembly a benchmark for figuring how far he rises or falls in the rankings. High-ranking gy≈çji then take on the laborious task of copying down the new rankings on a traditional Japanese paper roll called a maki. They carefully write down the kanji characters of each wrestler participating in a tournament in a calligraphy style called sumo moji. The work is very intricate and requires a great deal of skill. It usually takes about a week to complete the document. The banzuke information is carefully guarded for several weeks before it is released, which is usually on the Monday 13 days before an official tournament begins. The exception is the information about wrestlers who rise from the third division makushita to the second division juryo: their names become known immediately because they obtain the status of sekitori and have to make necessary preparations for it. The banzuke is printed at a greatly reduced size on sheets of paper (58 cm x 44 cm) and copies are distributed by the Japan Sumo Association. Sumo stables buy a large quantity of them to give to their sponsors. Tea houses in the Tokyo sumo venue Kokugikan also buy them to give out to their patrons.

Early years The corps was founded as a junior drum and bugle corps sponsored by the Polish Legion of American Veterans (P.L.A.V.) Post #14 in Syracuse, NY. It performed as a parade corps until World War II. After World War II, the group was reorganized as an all-age drum and bugle corps and began field competition in 1947. The Brigadiers competed in the American Legion National Championships from 1947 until 1964, making finals in every year. The corps captured American Legion National Championships in 1957 and 1958. In 1965, the Brigadiers became charter members of DCA, and they competed until 1973, when they ceased operations. Modern Years In October 1990, several alumni of the Syracuse Brigadiers met to discuss resurrecting the corps. After placing advertisements on television and radio, a parade corps was formed for 1991 and a field corps was formed in 1992. In their first year back in competition, the corps placed 11th at finals. In 1993, the corps placed ninth and regained full membership within DCA. The Brigadiers went on to win championships in 1997, 1999, 2000, 2001, and 2002. The 2002 show earned the corps what was at the time the highest recorded score in DCA history, 98.6.

While his goals were defined by a need to run a profitable business, he introduced procedures that replaced previous exploitative, earth-eroding lumbering on Saxe-Coburg's estates with practices that contained aspects of modern ecology. Greiner's insistence on a thorough woodland inventory of his employer's vast, poorly charted lands gave him his enduring recognition outside the field defined by his expertise. His passion for precision, geomatics, and the outdoors made him the first person ever to disprove the results of previous measurements and accurately identify Gerlachovsk√Ω ≈°t√≠t as the highest peak in the whole 1,500 km (900 mi.) long Carpathian mountain range.  Early life  Greiner was born to the family of the Lutheran pastor Karl Greiner in the small village of Lichtentanne (today part of Probstzella) in Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld in 1796. His baptismal name is still spelled Ludwig in German, Polish, and some SlovakFor instance, by a section director from the governmental Ministry of the Environment: Jozef Kram√°rik, \\"Dva nov√© n√°rodn√© parky v SR.\\" ≈Ωivotn√© prostredie, 32#1, 1998.

Most Slovak sources now render his baptismal name as ƒΩudov√≠t, the Hungarian sources render it as Lajos. Non-specialist sources also mostly misidentify him as a rank-and-file forester. After high school, he took special qualifying tests in forestry and spent several years gaining experience as forester in Austria and on the Lubomirski estates (administrated by the heirs of Julia Lubomirska) in Habsburg Galicia in the ≈Åa≈Ñcut and Lviv regions, now in Poland and Ukraine. He finished his education at the Vienna University of Technology where he took mathematics, physics, and chemistry in 1824‚Äì1826. He then became the director of forest management and timber rafting on Duke Ernest of Saxe-Coburg's estates, from where he was hired by Ernest's brother Ferdinand as the head of forestry and land management of all of his estates.Jozef Urgela, \\"ƒΩudov√≠t Greiner a jeho doba.\\" In: Miroslav Tibor Morovics, ed.

The estates as a company were headquartered in Vienna, but its center of operations was at Jolsva (Jel≈°ava) where Greiner spent the rest of his life. He married Maria Gl√≥sz, with whom he had nine children. Two sons, Hugo and Ludwig, followed in their father's footsteps. After his wife's death in 1857 Greiner married Otilia Szinowitz of Besztercab√°nya (today Bansk√° Bystrica, Slovakia), but had no more children. He was buried at the Jolsva (Jel≈°ava) cemetery next to his first wife.

The estate managed from K√°posztafalva (today Hrabu≈°ice, Slovakia) was in the vicinity of the Tatra Mountains, a craggy section of the Carpathians. According to Greiner's own account, he climbed Lomnick√Ω Peak () on 10 August 1837, a beautiful sunny day, measured its elevation with an altimeter and used the quadrant to determine that Gerlachovsk√Ω Peak () was actually higher. It was unexpected, because the previous, generally accepted measurement by the Swedish botanist G√∂ran Wahlenberg from 1813 recorded Gerlachovsk√Ω Peak's elevation as 285 m (935 ft) lower.Ivan Bohu≈°, \\"Men√≠ sa v√Ω≈°ka ≈°t√≠tov?\\" Tatry, 2007. Greiner was convinced that his own observation about Gerlachovsk√Ω Peak's relative height was right, but because he considered the altimeter and quadrant insufficiently precise instruments, he triangulated the elevations of several of the Tatra peaks from the vicinity of the town of Popr√°d (today Poprad, Slovakia), not far from K√°posztafalva (Hrabu≈°ice), in the fall of 1838Zofia Paryska-Radwa≈Ñska and Witold Henryk Paryski, Encyklopedia tatrza≈Ñska. 1973. after he obtained a very accurate theodolite from a friend.

The elevation Greiner calculated was off by only 13 meters (43 ft) by comparison to what it is known to be today.

The film stars Robert Ryan, Rod Steiger, Anita Ekberg and Gene Barry. The film is a remake of the 1939 film Five Came Back, also directed and produced by John Farrow. Richard Carroll, who is credited with writing the story for Back from Eternity, wrote the original story for Five Came Back. Plot A Douglas DC-2, from a tiny South American airline, is piloted by Captain Bill Lonagan and co-pilot Joe Brooks, bound for (fictional) Boca Grande. The passengers are: Jud Ellis, escorting his new fianc√©e Louise Melhorn; repentant political assassin Vasquel, being transported back to the proper authorities by bounty hunter Crimp; mobster Pete Bostwick, accompanying the son of his boss, Tommy; elderly Professor Spangler, accompanied on a research trip by his wife of 42 years; and prostitute Rena, on her way to work a South American casino. During the flight, the aircraft enters a rough storm and is dangerously jostled about, resulting in Crimp losing his revolver. A portable oxygen tank is loosened from its mooring and crashes through one of the fuselage doors, killing flight attendant Maria Alvarez. The crew is forced to make an emergency landing at a clearing in the remote jungle. Crimp tries to take charge of the group, but Vasquel stops him, revealing he has Crimp's revolver - which he gives to Captain Lonagan as the legal authority of the stranded group. Late one night, Crimp renders Bostwick temporarily unconscious, steals the revolver, then flees into the jungle. Ellis is consistently self-serving, to the disappointment of Louise, who finds herself mutually attracted to the brave and upright co-pilot Brooks. When Ellis gets drunk one night, then tries to force himself upon Louise, Brooks steps in to dissuade him. Lonagan and Rena form a connection, understanding each other's lot in life; he was a highly regarded pilot on major airlines until turning to drink after his wife died, while she is a post-war displaced person unable to get a passport, taken advantage of by men who pushed her into her profession. After a fortnight of effort, the aircraft is nearly repaired. Tommy wanders into the jungle but is found by Bostwick and Rena, who discover Crimp's headless body. Rena and Tommy return to camp, but local headhunters kill Bostwick with a poison dart. Everyone quickly boards the plane, but when Lonagan and Brooks start the engines, they discover an oil leak in one engine. Lonagan patches it, but informs the others that it will not hold long. With only one good engine, the aircraft can carry only five people - Tommy plus four adults - over the mountains. Everyone but Ellis quickly volunteers to be amongst the four who must stay behind and face the headhunters. With gun in hand, Vasquel takes charge, saying he will stay and will chose the other three via logic. The Spanglers, the most elderly, convince Vasquel they should stay. Vasquel selects Ellis as well, then has to kill him when Ellis grabs for the gun. The aircraft manages to take off. As the headhunters close in, Vasquel saves the Spanglers from torture by shooting them with the last two bullets, then prays as he awaits a horrible death.

M. Marshman to write a new version of Five Came Back. Marshman was reportedly going to incorporate a recent incident in Rio de Janeiro where a cable car broke down and left people marooned up in the air. John Farrow agreed to direct a remake as part of a three-picture deal with RKO. Production began in February 1956 and principal photography took place from March 5 to April 26. The supposed New York airport control tower shown near the beginning of the film is actually that of the Lockheed Air Terminal in Burbank, California. Reception Rod Steiger Despite its earlier notable screen heritage, Back from Eternity did not have a positive review from film critic Bosley Crowther at The New York Times. He said, in part, \\" ... the plight of a group of people downed in the South American wilds when the airliner in which they are traveling is forced to crash land by a violent thunderstorm ... This is the undistinguished company, and we hasten to advise that nothing that happens to them is either inspired or interesting. \\"Crowther, Bosley. \\"Back from Eternity (1956); Screen: Crash landing; 'Back From Eternity' opens at Victoria.\\" The New York Times, September 8, 1956.

He was heavily influenced by concrete and neoconcrete art. Many of Gerchman‚Äôs works are paintings based on populist themes and his political beliefs, which followed those of neoconcrete artists. His sculptures with letters, stem from concrete poetry. Career Gerchman studied at the Rio de Janeiro School of Fine Arts. In the 1960s, his work focused on mass culture. He used faces clipped from news photos, but unlike Andy Warhol, who used infamous celebrity, he used images of anonymous individuals. These faces would be reproduced as multiple painted images in a comic-strip style. In the late 1960s, Gerchman devoted his interest to urban isolation and alienation. He produced boxes and containers destined to be opened by spectators, and made a series of mixed media collages on wood, broadly titled Caixa de morar (Box to Live In), which reflects this theme. One work in this series, O rei do mau gosto (The King of Bad Taste), was a satire on the bourgeoisie and industrial tycoons set in a monstrous tropical paradise. From the mid-1960s to the early 1970s, Gerchman incorporated letters and words in his paintings, photographs, and sculptures. In 1967, he completed sculptural works which included Terra (Earth), Lute (\\"Struggle\\") and S√≥s (\\"Alone\\"). Terra integrated Gerchman‚Äôs box with hollowed out letters, while S√≥s played on his Boxes to Live In series with its reference to isolation and alienation. Lastly, Lute expresses political importance. During his stay in New York City from 1968-1973, Gerchman adapted to his new audience by producing works with English words. His new works still reflected Gerchman's populist nature, and are rooted in concrete poetry. Some of his work with letters also addresses issues of Latin America's relative geographic location in the Southern Hemisphere. Influences on Art Gerchman's work in the 1960s influenced the spread of kitsch in Brazilian paintings. His comic-strip inspired a form of pop art in Brazil that was based on people and events.

Gate oxide is formed by thermal oxidation of the silicon of the channel to form a thin (5 - 200 nm) insulating layer of silicon dioxide. The insulating silicon dioxide layer is formed through a process of self-limiting oxidation, which is described by the Deal-Grove model. A conductive gate material is subsequently deposited over the gate oxide to form the transistor. The gate oxide serves as the dielectric layer so that the gate can sustain as high as 1 to 5 MV/cm transverse electric field in order to strongly modulate the conductance of the channel. Above the gate oxide is a thin electrode layer made of a conductor which can be aluminium, a highly doped silicon, a refractory metal such as tungsten, a silicide (TiSi, MoSi, TaSi or WSi) or a sandwich of these layers. This gate electrode is often called \\"gate metal\\" or \\"gate conductor\\". The geometrical width of the gate conductor electrode (the direction transverse to current flow) is called the physical gate width. The physical gate width may be slightly different from the electrical channel width used to model the transistor as fringing electric fields can exert an influence on conductors that are not immediately below the gate. The electrical properties of the gate oxide are critical to the formation of the conductive channel region below the gate. In NMOS-type devices, the zone beneath the gate oxide is a thin n-type inversion layer on the surface of the p-type semiconductor substrate. It is induced by the oxide electric field from the applied gate voltage VG. This is known as the inversion channel. It is the conduction channel that allows the electrons to flow from the source to the drain.Fundamentals of Solid-State Electronics, Chih-Tang Sah.

Managed as a semi- independent arm of the Kuwaiti government, the Fund maintains sovereignty over its operations, notwithstanding governmental oversight. Originally, the Prime Minister of Kuwait chaired the Fund‚Äôs Board of Directors. However, in 2003, an amendment to the law was passed, conferring control of Kuwait Fund to the Minister of Foreign Affairs. In July 1974, the scope of the Fund‚Äôs activity was extended to the rest of the developing world (from its original mandate of solely helping countries in the Arab World) and its capital increased from KWD 200 million to KWD 1000 million. In March 1981, Kuwait Fund‚Äôs capital was again increased, this time doubled to KWD 2000 million, with its range enlarged to include participation in the capital and resources of development institutions and in the equity capital of certain corporate entities. Kuwait Fund headquarters in 1990, destroyed during the Iraqi invasion and occupation. The Kuwait Fund remained operational during the 1990 Iraqi Invasion of Kuwait While the headquarters were completely ransacked, the Fund regained its operational momentum shortly after the liberation of Kuwait. Through the Kuwait Fund, Kuwait maintains a higher foreign assistance ratio (as a percentage of the GNP) than do other rich capital surplus countries. Kuwait easily achieves and surpasses the target 0.7% of GNP that the United Nations specifies for development assistance. The State of Kuwait also maintains its support and contributions to the resources of other international development institutions, such as the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development, the African Development Bank, the International Fund for Agricultural Development, and the International Development Association through the Kuwait Fund.Economy Kuwait Fund for Arab And Economic Development (KFAED) Under a new law, the Kuwait Fund is obligated to transfer up to 25% of its net annual income to the Public Authority for Housing Assistance, as a contribution of its resources. Since 2004, the Kuwait Fund has launched the semi-annual Training Program for newly graduated Kuwaiti engineers and architects. Costing about KWD 1 million per year, the program seeks to train about 40 engineers and architects a year, by providing in-house training courses, a six-month apprenticeship in an international company abroad, and a local internship in Kuwait. The purpose of the program, as stated by the current Minister of Foreign Affairs Sheikh Mohammad Al-Sabah Al-Salem Al-Sabah, is to train and prepare Kuwaiti engineers and architects for work in the vastly expanding Kuwaiti private sector. A similar program is being held for business students at the Kuwait Investment Authority. Since its inception, the Kuwait Fund has given a total of 719 loans, to 101 beneficiary countries, totaling KWD 3,857.79 million. 200 Grants & technical assistance packages have been distributed to 88 countries and institutions, totaling KWD 98.54 million.

Its see is the Cremona Cathedral. The diocese has 223 parishes, all located within the region of Lombardy, and the majority (174) within the Province of Cremona, besides 28 in the Province of Mantua, 17 in the Province of Bergamo, and 4 in the Province of Milan.Source for parishes: . History Cremona is in Lombardy, Italy, on the left bank of the River Po. It was built by the Cenomanni Gauls, but later became a Roman colony and a frontier fortress. About 600 Cremona, until then a part of the Byzantine Empire, was captured by the Lombard king, Agilulf. Under the Emperor Otto I and his successors, its bishops acquired temporal sovereignty, but in 900 the people expelled Bishop Olderico and adopted a republican form of government. The Emperor Henry IV (1056‚Äì1106), however, confirmed Bishop Landulf in all imperial grants made to his predecessors. On the other hand Emperor Henry V (1106‚Äì25) restored to the people their communal rights. Thenceforth Cremona became a citadel of Ghibellinism and was greatly favoured by Frederic Barbarossa and Emperor Frederick II, though for the same reason frequently at war with the neighbouring cities. In later medieval times it had many lords or \\"tyrants\\", the Pallavicini, the Bovara, the Cavalcabo, the Visconti, the Sforza, until it became part of the Duchy of Milan (1328). In 1702 it was taken by imperial troops, and in 1796 and 1800 fell into the hands of the French. The people of Cremona consider St. Sabinus to be their first missionary and first bishop; he is said to have lived in the 1st century, though there is no documentary or monumental proof of his existence.Cf. Sanclemente, p. 1, no. 1: \\"Sabinus circa An. D. LV., a quo traditur nominata Ecclesia S. Savini.\\" Lanzoni observes that the episcopal lists are not all names of historical bishops, but actually only of persons who had a public cult (such as a church named after them) in the diocese: \\"molti e forti indizi dimostrano che i santi enumerati nel Communicantes non furono antichi vescovi di Cremona, ricordati nell'ordine di successione dai primordi in poi, ma nella immensa maggioranza semplicemente santi, vescovi o no, che ebbero ed hanno culto pubblico in Cremona.\\" His putative successor, Felix (c. 86) is known only from the name of a church.Sanclemente, p. 1: FELIX circa An. Salutis LXXXVI., a quo fertur dicta Ecclesia S. Felicis.\\" Among the early bishops are St. Syrinus (c. 340), a vigorous opponent of Arianism, and St. Silvinus (733). Liudprand of Cremona was sent (946) as ambassador to Constantinople by the Emperor Otto II, and is a noted historical writer of the 10th century. Other important bishops were Gualtiero (1096), in whose time the cathedral was begun; Sicardus (1185‚Äì1215), author of a chronicle and of the Mitrale, a handbook on ecclesiastical offices; Cacciaconte da Somma (1261‚Äì1285), under whom was erected the belfry of the cathedral; Niccolo Sfondrati (1560‚Äì1590), later Pope Gregory XIV; his nephew Cardinal Paolo Sfondrati (1607‚Äì1610); also the zealous and charitable Omobono di Offredi (1791‚Äì1829). Bartolomeo Platina, the papal scriptor, Librarian of the Vatican Library, and noted author of papal biographies, styled himself Cremonensis. The complicated election of 1313 Bishop Raynerius de Casulo died two or three days before Christmas 1312.Sanclemente, pp. 129-130, conjectures that it was several days before Christmas Eve, since (according to him) bishops were laid out for viewing by the people for several days before interment. This was not the case, however, for popes or for most persons, clerical or lay. The prelimary meeting to summon electors to a meeting to elect his successor met on 15 February 1313, and fixed 17 February as the day of the election.A notarized set of minutes of the proceedings survives, and has been published by Sanclemente, pp. 129-134 (partially summarized), and Cappelletti XII, pp. 194-201 (verbatim). Twelve electors met on 17 February in the Choir of the cathedral, and announced their votes on oath in a scrutiny. Six of the twelve cast their votes for Canon Egidiolus de Bonseriis, four for Canon and Cantor Egidius de Madalbertis, one for Canon Joannes de Parma, and one for the Archpriest. Egidiolus had half of the votes, but not a majority. Bickering began immediately. Egidiolus' party claimed that his supporters were older, were more outstanding in merit, and held more prestigeous positions; they claimed that Egidius was not in Holy Orders, and therefore should not be electable. The other party pointed out that, while Egidiolus had more votes than Egidius, he had not reached a majority and his supporters were not the sanior pars of the electors; moreover, he possessed insufficient knowledge and his lifestyle was not commendable (as required by the Lateran Council).Cappelletti, p. 198. Each party however proclaimed its candidate elected, and sang a Te Deum. Sanclemente, relying on the authority of an unpublished manuscript by Giuseppe Maria Bonafossa, states that Egidiolus immediately demanded confirmation of his electio from his Metropolitan, Archbishop Gaston of Milan. The archbishop took the plea, and granted Egidiolus possession and administration rights. Egidiolus' opponents immediately registered a complaint with the archbishop, and demanded the confirmation of Egidius de Madalbertis, according to Cappelletti.Sanclemente, p. 133. If Sanclemente had had any documentary evidence, he would have, as was his practice, quoted it. Cappelletti XII, p. 200, repeats Sanclemente. In due course, the suits reached the papal Court. Unfortunately, Pope Clement V died on 20 April 1314, before the impasse was resolved. The papal Sede vacante lasted until 7 August 1316, when the Conclave elected Cardinal Jacques Du√®se as Pope John XXII. Pope John XXII finally issued a ruling on 18 July 1318,G. Mollat, Jean XXII: Lettres communes analys√©es d'apr√®s les registres dits d'Avignon et du Vatican Tome deuxi√®me (Paris: Fontemoing 1905), p. 220, no. 7817. stating that Egidius de Madalbertis, Canon of the Church of Cremona, was the bishop of Cremona, to which he had been elected following the death of Bishop Raynerius.The date is 1318, not 1317 as stated by Sanclemente and Cappelletti. Eubel I, p. 214, with notes 6 and 7, following Mollat. Is it possible that Mollat made a mistake in the date of the letter? Synods A diocesan synod was an irregularly held, but important, meeting of the bishop of a diocese and his clergy. Its purpose was (1) to proclaim generally the various decrees already issued by the bishop; (2) to discuss and ratify measures on which the bishop chose to consult with his clergy; (3) to publish statutes and decrees of the diocesan synod, of the provincial synod, and of the Holy See.

In 1550, Cardinal Francesco Sfondrati, Bishop of Cremona (1549‚Äì1550), issued a set of constitutions and edicts to be observed in his diocese. In his letter of transmittal, he admits that his predecessors for more than seventy years, because of their long absences, had allowed some of the clergy and people of the diocese to go wrong, which made corrections both beneficial and necessary.\\"In commisi nobis pastoralis officii regimine, illud inter alias animi nostri sollicitudines consideramus attente, quod propter bonae memoriae Reverendissimorum Dominorum praedecessorum nostrorum in episcopatu praedicto, ab eodem diutinam ultra annos septuaginta absentiam, nonnulkla ita in clero et populo Cremonae adeo in sinistrum deflexerunt, et eis operae pretium est salubri, et necessaria reformatione, et correctione succurere....\\" Bishop Cesare Speciano (1591‚Äì1607) held a diocesan synod in Cremona in 1599. He held his second diocesan synod in 1604. Cardinal Pietro Campori (1621‚Äì1643) held a diocesan synod in 1635. Bishop Alessandro Litta (1718‚Äì1749) held a diocesan synod in the cathedral in Cremona on 28-30 April 1727. Bishops The Diocese of Cremona provides a list of its bishops on its officia web site.

Early life Douglas Berneville-Claye was born in Plumstead, the son of a Staff Sergeant in the Royal Army Service Corps. His father's family, the Clays, Websters, and Wainwrights, were industrial working-class from Leeds, Yorkshire, and his father, Frederick Wainwright Claye, was awarded an MBE in 1919 for his services in France. He was educated in the local schools and in 1932 enrolled at the Army Technical School at Chepstow. He left the Army Technical School and went home to his parents' pub at Little Ouseburn, a village on the old Roman road between Ripon and York. His father had retired from the army after long service. In 1934 he joined the Lancers at York, which is probably where he learned to ride. He was still only 17 when he left the army to work as an instructor at a riding school near Thames Ditton and married there for the first time. That marriage lasted a matter of weeks but resulted in a daughter. In 1936, he abandoned his wife to move to Leeds, where he worked as a freelance journalist for the local press. Second World War On the outbreak of the Second World War Claye volunteered for the Royal Air Force and was accepted as an aircrew trainee, but he did not pass his final exams. In April 1940 he went AWOL to enter into a bigamous marriage with his current girlfriend. A son was born of the first bigamous marriage. Following this, he found a job in an aircraft factory and joined the Home Guard. Claye borrowed his father's old uniform and began wearing it in public, with a set of RAF pilot's wings attached. While doing so he was involved in a traffic accident, and after hospital treatment was sent to a convalescent home for officers. While there, he stole another officer's cheque book and after a police investigation was discovered to have obtained the sum of ¬£5 10s by deception. He appeared before magistrates and was additionally fined ¬£7 for impersonating an officer. Although he was remanded for trial, the charges were eventually dropped because he had repaid the money he had stolen and agreed to be bound over for two years. Active service It was at this time that Claye started calling himself the Honourable Douglas St Aubyn Webster Berneville-Claye and enlisted as a private soldier in the West Yorkshire Regiment. He did not stay in the ranks for long. At enlistment, he claimed to have been educated at Charterhouse School, Magdalen College, Oxford, and Emmanuel College, Cambridge, and as a result was selected for officer training. The officer training was carried out at Pwllheli and Sandhurst, where he was granted his commission as a second lieutenant in October 1941. He spent six months with the 11th Battalion of the West Yorkshire Regiment, then in June 1942 was posted to Egypt. Berneville was one of his given names, along with Webster (his grandmother's maiden name) but it's not known why he chose to use 'St Aubyn'. His surname at birth was Clay. In the next few months he was again charged with cheque fraud and court- martialled, but he carried out his own legal representation (claiming to be a barrister) and managed to be acquitted. He then supposedly inherited his father's title and became \\"Lord Charlesworth\\" and volunteered for L detachment of the Special Air Service, reportedly in a quartermaster role. His father had had a successful army career, working his way up through the ranks from the early years of the 20th century to his retirement in the early 1930s as a senior NCO and the award of an MBE, but there was no title that could have been inherited. Capture by the enemy In December 1942, he took part in a penetration operation in Tunisia and was captured by the Afrika Korps. He was sent from North Africa to Italy where he was interrogated, and then sent to an Italian Prisoner of War camp in northern Italy, from which he later claimed to have made repeated escapes. After the Italian Armistice in September 1943, Claye and his POWs were evacuated to Germany where he ended up in Oflag 79 at Waggum, near Brunswick. Collaboration During 1944, the prisoners in Oflag 79 began to suspect that one of their number was an informer, and they eventually decided that it was Berneville-Claye. In December 1944, after Oflag 79 had been moved to Fallingbostel, the Senior British Officer informed the camp's German Commandant that the prisoners planned to court-martial and execute an informer and Claye was transferred by the Germans for his own safety. Claye's subsequent movements are unclear. He was reportedly sighted by POWs in Fallingbostel and Hanover dressed in civilian clothing but then disappeared from view until early March 1945 when he was appointed to the staff of the III (Germanic) SS Panzer Corps at Templin, dressed as an SS Hauptsturmf√ºhrer. He was invited to dine with the III Corps commander, Obergruppenf√ºhrer Felix Steiner, where he explained that although he was a captain in the Coldstream Guards and a member of the British peerage, \\"Lord Charlesworth\\", he was a firm anti-communist and had volunteered to fight to preserve Europe from the communist threat. Apparently, he was so convincing that Steiner took him at face value. At that time, the remains of the British Free Corps were in the same area, and Steiner decided to appoint Claye to take charge of them. On 19 April 1945 he arrived at the Corps' base in Templin 'dressed in a black SS tank uniform bearing the insignia of Hauptsturmf√ºhrer in the British Free Corps.'Weale, Adrian (12 November 2014). Renegades (Kindle Location 3083). Random House. Kindle Edition Claye told the Corps members 'that he was the son of an earl, a captain in the Coldstream Guards and was going to collect two armoured cars and lead them against the Russians. He also guaranteed that the BFC men would be in no trouble with the British authorities, telling them that Britain would be at war with the Russians within a few days.'.Weale, Adrian (12 November 2014). Renegades (Kindle Locations 3116‚Äì3118). Random House. Kindle Edition When the Corps members refused to follow him, Claye took Alexander MacKinnon, one of the Free Corps soldiers, as a driver, and headed west in a stolen vehicle. He discarded his German uniform and surrendered to a British airborne unit somewhere west of Schwerin. Claye managed to evade any repercussions for his collaboration with the Germans; the former inmates of Oflag 79 had no concrete evidence that Claye had been the informer they had sought, and no evidence could be found that Claye had actually volunteered for the Waffen-SS. Claye's story was that he had escaped from Oflag 79 by his own efforts and had acquired a uniform from a German woman with whom he had hid. Evidence from British Free Corps soldiers was deemed too tainted to use in court. Postwar Claye was sent back to Britain a free man and given the acting rank of captain. He next became the adjutant of a POW camp in Yorkshire. He was court-martialled again for wearing the ribbon of the Distinguished Service Order, which he claimed he had been awarded, and as a result was demoted to second lieutenant and lost his seniority. He was also court-martialled for having an \\"improper relationship\\" with an ATS driver (a son was born of that relationship, adopted) and was finally court-martialled for the theft of army property for which he was cashiered and imprisoned. Around this time he decided to remarry, when his bigamy also came to light. A son was born of the second bigamous marriage. After his release from prison Claye dropped out of sight. He appeared as a witness for the defence in a murder trial in 1950, then in the late 1950s surfaced near Hemel Hempstead, where he secured a managerial position with Rank Xerox. Claye played the role of an ex-Guards officer, riding to hounds, chairing village committees, and wearing his decorations at Remembrance Day parades. This ended when he abandoned his family and ran off with the wife of one of his colleagues (a son, adopted, was born of that escapade). He soon returned to his wife, after which the family emigrated to Australia. Four children were born of that second marriage. In Australia, Claye worked for a time as a radio announcer before becoming a schoolteacher at St Gregory's College in Campbelltown, New South Wales. He died of cancer in 1975. Until 2008, the school had a \\"Douglas Berneville-Claye Memorial Trophy\\" awarded for debating and public speaking.Campbelltown 'hero' linked to Nazis , Campbelltown MacArthur Advertiser, 25 March 2009 In popular culture Many readers' first acquaintance with the British Free Corps came in Jack Higgins's Second World War thriller The Eagle Has Landed. In the novel, a BFC Officer named Harvey Preston, who is patterned on Berneville-Claye, is attached to a Fallschirmj√§ger unit which attempts to kidnap Winston Churchill. A convinced Nazi and petty criminal, Preston is viewed with disgust by all members of the German unit. Notes References Ronald Seth. Jackals of the Reich. The Story of the British Free Corps.

Three was the first Yugoslav movie released in the United States (in 1966). Aleksandar Petroviƒá's films Three and I Even Met Happy Gypsies provided the world an introduction to Yugoslav cinema. Unlike ‚ÄòThree‚Äô it was very well received and translated in over 100 languages.  Reception  A review from the New York Times from 1967 when it was nominated for Best foreign film at the Academy Awards War‚Äôs utter bestiality and waste, usually illustrated by armies, is brought into sharp focus by a talented few in ‚ÄúThree,‚Äù a prize-winning Yugoslav drama that treats its bleak and harrowing subject with a grim but poetic artistry. It had a showing at the New York Film Festival last year, and is now at the Studio Cinema and 72d Street Theaters. The film is mystifyingly abrupt in its transitions, but its effects, physical and intellectual, are unmistakably forceful and chilling. The director, Aleksandar Petrovic, with the aid of a sparse script and stunning photography by Tomislav Pinter, has pointed up war‚Äôs ravages as it affects one partisan‚Äôs fights in one small sector of the conflict. In each of three events he is part of, needless death brought about by fear, despair and defeat.

He was a Senator for Victoria from 1901 to 1910, and then represented the Division of Kooyong in the House of Representatives from 1910 to 1922. Best served in cabinet in the second and third governments of Alfred Deakin. Before entering federal politics, he also served in the Victorian Legislative Assembly from 1889 to 1901, where he was a government minister. Early life Born in the Melbourne suburb of Collingwood to (Northern) Irish immigrants, and raised in Kyneton, Best was educated at Templeton's School, Fitzroy. He left school at 13 and became a clerk in a printing office and then worked for a solicitor where he took articles and matriculated in 1875. He studied law at the University of Melbourne and was admitted as a solicitor in 1881. He married Jane Langridge the same year. He was elected as an alderman on Fitzroy City Council almost continuously from 1883 to 1897 and served as mayor in 1888 and 1889. Political career In April 1889, Best was elected to the Victorian Legislative Assembly as the member for Fitzroy (later subsumed by the seat of Richmond) and was offered, but turned down, a position in William Shiels' ministry in 1892. From September 1894 to December 1899 he was President of the Board of Land and Works, Commissioner of Crown Lands and Survey, and Commissioner of Trade and Customs. He was responsible for introducing tariff reform in 1896 and land reform in 1898 to promote closer settlement and acted twice as Premier. Best was a strong supporter of the federation of Australia and resigned from the Legislative Assembly and was elected to the Australian Senate in the 1901 election. He was the inaugural Chairman of Committees in the Senate, serving from 1901 to 1903. He was Vice- President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate from February 1907 until November 1908 in the third Deakin Ministry, where he was responsible for tariff and excise bills. Best was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1908. He served as Minister for Trade and Customs in Alfred Deakin's Fusion ministry from June 1909 to April 1910. He lost his seat in the landslide to Labor at the 1910 election, but was soon returned to Parliament at a by-election for the House of Representatives seat of Kooyong. He supported the introduction of conscription and he became a Nationalist in 1917. At the 1922 election, he was beaten narrowly on Labor preferences by John Latham, who ran as an independent on the slogan, \\"Get Rid of Hughes\\". Later life Undated photo Best returned full-time to his legal practice, which he had never abandoned. After the death of his first wife in 1901, he married Maude Evelyn Crocker-Smith. He died in 1946 in the Melbourne suburb of Hawthorn survived by two sons and two daughters of his first marriage and four daughters of his second. His second daughter Phyllis Best was an actress who toured with Dame Sybil Thorndike and married fellow actor and radio personality Atholl Fleming.(Melbourne) Argus 12 September 1932 His third daughter, Helene Best, was a pianist who trained at the Melbourne Conservatory.

He was formerly performance director of British Cycling and is currently general manager of . Early life Brailsford was born in Shardlow, Derbyshire, and moved as a toddler with his parents and siblings to Deiniolen, near Caernarfon in Wales: He attended Ysgol Deiniolen and Ysgol Brynrefail, and learned Welsh. In 1984 he gave up his job as an apprentice draughtsman with the local highways department to travel to France, where he raced for four years as a sponsored amateur for a team based in Saint-√âtienne. He has described his years in France as a time of autodidacticism: He returned in 1988 to study for a degree in Sport and Exercise Sciences and Psychology at Chester College of Higher Education (then an affiliated college of the University of Liverpool, now the University of Chester) and then an MBA at Sheffield Hallam University. Career Early career Brailsford spent some of his early career working as an export sales manager at Planet X Bikes. He was first employed by British Cycling as a consultant in 1998, after Lottery funding began the previous year. Brailsford became programmes director before becoming performance director in 2003 following the departure of Peter Keen. 'Marginal gains' philosophy At British Cycling, Brailsford was noted for his innovative concept of 'marginal gains': Brailsford's approach involved the constant measuring and monitoring of key statistics such as cyclists' power output, and training interventions targeting specific weaknesses, for example the relative weakness of Bradley Wiggins in mountain racing. As well as looking at traditional components of success such as physical fitness and tactics, it also entailed a more holistic strategy, embracing technological developments, athlete psychology, and everyday life: Peaking in the mid-2010s at the height of Brailsford's reputation, 'marginal gains' philosophy was discussed beyond cycling in the UK mainstream media. Brailsford's '1% Factor' was also discussed in business circles in the UK and internationally. In UK education policy, the Social Mobility Commission argued in 2014 that improvements in the academic performance of disadvantaged students in British schools could be compared to \\"the success of [the] British cycling team: the aggregation of marginal gains\\". Writing on the 2016 EU referendum, the political commentator Tim Shipman cited \\"the philosophy of the Team Sky cycling team\\" in making the argument that \\"tiny improvements\\" made by the Remain campaign could have changed the referendum's result. Latterly, the philosophy has been criticised and ridiculed, including by Wiggins. Great Britain cycling team At the 2004 Olympic Games Great Britain won two cycling gold medals, their best performance since 1908. Under Brailsford's leadership, the cycling team continued to improve, winning multiple world championships in road, track, BMX and mountain bike racing. Great Britain led the cycling medal table at the 2008 and 2012 Olympic Games, winning eight golds at both, while British cyclists won 59 World Championships across different disciplines from 2003 to 2013. Team Sky In 2010, Brailsford also became the manager of the new British-based professional team, Team Sky. In this role he oversaw Bradley Wiggins', Chris Froome's and Geraint Thomas' victories in the 2012, 2013, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 Tours de France. In April 2014, Brailsford resigned as performance director at British Cycling to concentrate on his Team Sky responsibilities. Team Ineos Team Sky became Team Ineos in May 2019, due to a change of sponsor. Brailsford remained as team principal after the changeover. Doping controversy In March 2018 the Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee published the report Combatting Doping in Sport. Chapter 2 of the report, \\"British Cycling and Team Sky\\", focused on Therapeutic Use Exemptions (TUEs) gained by both organisations for the use of drugs on the WADA Prohibited List, citing the defence used by Wiggins and Shane Sutton that TUEs were used to \\"find gains\\" and put oneself \\"back on a level playing field\\" with rivals. The report alleged in particular that the drug triamcinolone had been \\"used to prepare\\" Wiggins \\"and possibly other riders supporting him\\" for the 2012 Tour de France, \\"not to treat medical need, but to improve his power to weight ratio ahead of the race\\". It concluded that Team Sky had crossed an \\"ethical line\\" by exploiting this loophole \\"to enhance the performance of riders\\". Following the publication of the report, Brailsford was defended by Chris Froome. Honours * In June 2005, December 2008 and December 2012, respectively, Brailsford was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE), Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) and a Knight Bachelor, the latter for services to cycling and the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games. * In December 2008 the 14 medals, including eight golds, achieved by British Cycling at the Olympics won him the BBC Sports Personality of the Year's Coach Award. * In November 2008 and December 2009, respectively, he was awarded honorary doctorates by his alma maters the University of Chester and Sheffield Hallam University. * In December 2012 he won the BBC Sports Personality of the Year Coach Award for a second time. * As a resident of Ilkeston, he also in December 2012 received the Freedom of the Borough of Erewash, Derbyshire. * In October 2016 he was inducted into the British Cycling Hall of Fame.

It connects that province to the rest of the country, as well as being one of two routes to the south-west extremity of North-Western Province. It also serves as the main highway of the western half of Central Province. The entire route from Lusaka to Mongu is designated as the M9 Road. In the Copperbelt, however, the road going west to Solwezi also used to be known as the Great West Road. At that time Copperbelt Province was, despite its central location, known as Western Province. Road development was slower to start in the west of the country than in other parts. A dirt road was built from the Great North Road at Landless Corner to Mumbwa in the early 1930s (today designated as the M20), but was not extended to Kaoma and Mongu until 1937, about ten years after road transport started in other provinces. The Great West Road did not have the same recognition and maintenance as the better-known Great North Road and Great East Road, and was also for a time only the third most used route to the west. A route by ox wagon and boat up the Zambezi from Livingstone was the most used in the first decades of the 20th century. A road was made from Mululwe, the end of the Mulobezi Railway, along the banks of the Luampa River and then across the sandy plain to Mongu about the same time as the Great West Road was built and, thanks to the railway, was used more, until the 1950s.H C N Ridley, \\"Early History of Road Transport in Northern Rhodesia\\". Northern Rhodesia Journal, Vol 2, No. 5 (1954), pp 16-23. The first Great West Road was a dirt road with pontoon ferries across rivers such as the Kafue. It passed through only two towns: Mumbwa and Kaoma. The first 100 km passed through farmland and bush north of the Kafue Flats and like the middle section crossing the Kafue National Park, was constructed with laterite gravel. Most of the last third passes through virtually uninhabited bush with no streams or rivers. It is completely dry except after rain in the wet season and is very sandy, which took its toll on trucks and their drivers, as vehicles could get bogged in sand in the dry season, in addition to the usual rainy season hazards of floods and washed-out sections. The fact that the road started at Landless Corner, 69 km north of Lusaka, suited traffic to and from the Copperbelt. Lusaka did not become the capital of the country until about the time the road was built (1935) and it was not until the late 1940s that it became an important centre. A shortcut to Lusaka from Mumbwa via Nakachenje, bypassing Landless Corner, was built around this time. The Great West Road was first paved around 1969, to a new alignment which, controversially for the residents of those towns, bypassed Mumbwa and Kaoma by a few kilometres. The Nakachenje branch was paved a little later. A lack of maintenance through the late 1970s and 1980s meant that by the 1990s the pavement was in bad condition and had lost in some sections. The Nakachenje branch was in better condition and became accepted as being the Great West Road while the Landless Corner section was neglected, and by 2005, was a poor dirt road. In the last decade the Great West Road has been rehabilitated and in 2005 was classed as being in good condition. Route The older route, from the Landless Corner junction with the T2 Road (Great North Road) in Chibombo District (70 kilometres north of Lusaka by the Wangwa Farm) to Mumbwa is designated as the M20 Route on Zambia's road network. It is 120 kilometres in length up to Mumbwa Central and is in poor condition, with motorists having the impression that the road is really not being properly maintained.https://www.lusakatimes.com/2014/05/16/landless-corner-mumbwa-road- poorly-done/ The newer route from Lusaka Central, commonly known as the Nakachenje Route, is designated as the M9 Road. It begins north of Lusaka Central, at a roundabout junction with the T2 Road (Great North Road) and the T4 Road (Great East Road). It goes west up to the junction with Lumumba Road. It joins Lumumba Road southwards up to the next junction, where it becomes the road west as Mumbwa Road. It is one road for the remainder of its length. From Lumumba Road in Lusaka, it goes west for 150 kilometres, through the northern area of Chilanga District (Mwembeshi) and Shibuyunji District, entering Central Province, to bypass Mumbwa to the south. South-west of Mumbwa, the M9 is joined by the M20 Road from Landless Corner. From Mumbwa, the M9 goes west for 130 kilometres as Mongu Road to cross the Kafue River and enter the central area of the Kafue National Park north of the town of Itezhi-Tezhi. It continues for another 120 kilometres, leaving Central Province and entering Western Province, to the town of Kaoma, which it bypasses to the south. From Kaoma, the road goes west for 200 kilometres to the city of Mongu to end at a roundabout intersection with the M10 Road from Senanga and the Namibia Border in the south. Westwards extension An ambitious project, the Barotse Floodplain causeway was started in 2002 to extend the Great West Road from Mongu to Kalabo on a 46-kilometre causeway across the Barotse Floodplain, via the ferry across the Zambezi's main channel at Sandaula, which would then be replaced by a 500-metre bridge. Originally intended to be completed in 2006, it has been delayed by technical problems of building on the floodplain, and consequent funding problems. The long term intention is to then continue the highway into Angola and to connect with its road network as a new trade route for Zambia to Atlantic Ocean ports. If this happens despite the environmental problems of crossing the floodplain, the road could finally rival the Great East Road and the Great North Road in Zambia's network.Sylvia Mweetwa: \\"Road financiers to extend agreement.\\" Ndola: Times of Zambia, 5 April 2007.Chris McIntyre (2004). Zambia: The Bradt Travel Guide online at www.zambia-travel- guide.com. Retrieved 21 November 2007. The road was constructed by AVIC International (Aviation Industry Corporation of China) and as of 2016, the road over the Barotse Floodplain has been completed.http://travelzambia.co/content/barotse-plains-then-and-now https://www.lusakatimes.com/2016/04/08/mongu-kalabo-road-completed/ It consists of 26 bridges crossing the floodplain. Route While the M9 from Lusaka ends at the roundabout-junction with the M10 Road from the Namibia Border, the road continuing westwards over the Barotse Floodplain is designated as the D819 on the Zambian Road Network. It first goes westwards for 14 kilometres to the settlement named Lealui. From Lealui, the road continues westwards as the Barotse Floodplain Causeway for 34 kilometres up until it reaches a junction with the RD319 Road at the settlement of Lutwi. The RD319 Road, which is coming from Kalongola (south of Senanga) in the south, is the road which goes northwards to Kalabo from this junction (22 kilometres). The route from Mongu to Kalabo is 70 kilometres. There is yet to be a proper trade road from Kalabo westwards to the border into Angola.

In 1967, it was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. It was also entered into the 1966 Cannes Film Festival. It sold more than tickets in Poland, becoming one of the highest-grossing Polish films of all time. Novel Jerzy Kawalerowicz, who had previously directed such films as Cellulose (1953), Under the Phrygian Star (1954), The Shade (1956), The Real End of the Great War (1957), Night Train (1959) and Mother Joan of the Angels (1961), turned in the 1960s to Boles≈Çaw Prus' novel Pharaoh because, he said, \\"There are brilliant things in it.... The drama of power in Pharaoh is incredibly topical and contemporary. The mechanics don't change all that much.\\" Kawalerowicz's co-author of the scenario, Tadeusz Konwicki, commented: \\"It's not a historical novel in the full sense of the word, it's above all a penetrating analysis of a system of power.... The story of Ramses XIII is a typical example of the actions of a young person who enters upon life with a faith and need for renewal. He does not yet know anything about higher reasons of state, he has no interest in the laws governing the complex apparatus of power. It seems to him that he is the person to change the existing order of things.\\"Leon Schiller State School, \\"Faraon.\\" Film Pharaohs production took three years, beginning in the fall of 1962 with the setting up of a studio in ≈Å√≥d≈∫ which did in-depth studies of the costumes and realia of life in ancient Egypt. Filming took place in Europe, Asia and Africa. Most of the indoor scenes of the pharaoh's palace, the temples and the Labyrinth were shot at the ≈Å√≥d≈∫ studio. The Warsaw River Shipyard built an Egyptian ship according to drawings from 4,000 years ago. An artificial island was created on Lake Kirsajty, near Gi≈ºycko, Poland, and planted with palms and lotus for the scene involving Ramses' row on the Nile with Sara. Mass scenes were filmed mainly in Uzbekistan's part of the Kyzyl Kum Desert. The crew spent nearly five months there, working in very difficult conditions‚Äîat the height of summer, the noon temperature exceeded 50 degrees Celsius (122 Fahrenheit); the temperature of the sand, 80 degrees Celsius (176 Fahrenheit). Film stock had to be kept in cold storage. A very vexatious thing was the ubiquitous dust. Every day, 10,000 bottles of mineral water were delivered to the shooting location. Hazards included sand vipers and venomous spiders that launched themselves at people from a couple of yards' distance. Some scenes were filmed at authentic Egyptian locales. For example, the scene in which Prince Ramses learns that his father Pharaoh Ramses XII has died and that he has now become Pharaoh Ramses XIII, takes place against the backdrop of the pyramids of Gizeh; but the crowds of tourists and the present-day appearance of the area made it near-impossible to find good takes. One of the many consultants on the film was Poland's Professor Kazimierz Micha≈Çowski, a world authority in Egyptology. Another was Shadi Abdel Salam, an Egyptian film director and costume designer, who had consulted on the 1963 Cleopatra. Abdel Salam was the costume designer for Pharaoh. In adapting Boles≈Çaw Prus' novel to the screen, the film's producers made a number of notable decisions.

The village lies northeast of Nayland, southwest of Hadleigh and north of Colchester. It is situated on a small tributary stream of the River Stour. History The name Polstead is derived from \\"Place by a pool\\"Eilert Ekwall, The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place-names, OUP, Fourth Edition (1960) There are still two large ponds in the village. The village is noted for being the site of the Red Barn Murder in 1827. The victim Maria Marten, once found, was re-buried in the churchyard of St Mary's Church, but her gravestone was eventually chipped away to nothing by souvenir hunters. Only a sign on a shed wall now marks the approximate place where it stood,\\"Polstead\\" at beautifulengland.net although her name is given to Marten's Lane which adjoins Water Lane and Mill Street. The church, situated at the bottom of Polstead Hill, close to Polstead Pond, dates from the 12th century and contains some of what may be the earliest bricks made in England. The tower, which is 14th-century, is the only one in Suffolk which still has its original spire, although Pevsner says the spire is later than the tower. The tower at one time contained six bells. The interior of the church contains two brasses, one of which is of a priest and bears a date of 1460.Nikolaus Pevsner (1961), Buildings_of_England: Suffolk, Penguin, Polstead. Polstead Hall Next to the churchyard is Polstead Hall, rebuilt in the Georgian style in about 1819. In the grounds of the hall are the remains of the \\"Gospel Oak\\", which collapsed in 1953, but which is believed to have been the tree under which Saint Cedd preached to the heathen Anglo-Saxons. A small oak tree now grows next to the place it once stood. Features The main village is situated around Polstead Green and the Hill, although Polstead also comprises several hamlets including Polstead Heath, Hadleigh Heath, Bower House Tye, Bell's Corner, Mill Street and Whitestreet Green. The village has one remaining pub, the 17th century Cock Inn, a community shop and post office and a playing field. The playing field, known locally as the pitch, hosts an annual music festival around the summer solstice called \\"Polstice\\", with local punk, folk and rock bands playing. In the 19th century a fair, lasting for two days, was held on Polstead Green on the Wednesday following 16 July.Polstead at genuki Polstead is famous for its cherries and lends its name to a variety, the Polstead Black.

The two vessels encountered each other at 6 p.m. at and after a short chase by Iris, an action of one and a half hours began. When Iris lost her foremast, main topmast, and mizzenmast, Citoyenne Fran√ßaise escaped. She had lost Captain Dubedat and 15 other men killed, and 37 men wounded. British casualties were four men killed, one man mortally wounded, and 31 wounded.James (1837), Vol. 1, pp. 91‚Äì93. The French Navy requisitioned Citoyenne Fran√ßaise in August, but then returned her to her former owners in December 1795. Her owners again deployed her as a privateer. Fate and captured her on 8 September 1798 after Phaeton had chased her for 20 hours. Captain Robert Stopford, of Phaeton, in his letter described Flore as a frigate of 36 guns and 255 men. She was eight days out of Boulogne on a cruise. Stopford had heard of her departure and had searched for her for a week. Flore was then sold for breaking up.

She was married to Richard Acton from 1974 to 1984. Todd was born at Dadaya Mission in Rhodesia. She was educated at Queen Elizabeth Girls School. Her missionary father, Reginald Stephen Garfield Todd, served as Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesia between 1953 and 1958. Her mother, Jean Grace Wilson Todd, designed and implemented the Southern Rhodesian African Educational System. Todd was a political activist from the early 1960s when she joined the Black Nationalist movement by becoming a member of the National Democratic Party (NDP) which was formed in 1960. She later joined the Zimbabwe African People's Union after the NDP was banned by the government. She opposed the minority government of Ian Smith and campaigned internationally against the minority white rule in Rhodesia. In October 1964, she was arrested by Rhodesian authorities and was convicted. In January 1972, she was arrested again and sent to a jail in Marandellas. Her father was arrested at the same time and went to jail in Gatooma. During her imprisonment, she briefly went on hunger strike in protest against their detention, but relented after enduring several incidents of force-feeding. Several weeks later, both were released and were subsequently expelled from the country, becoming personae non gratae. She relocated to London. In 1978 she was among the founding members of Zimbabwe Project Trust, a humanitarian organization connected to the Roman Catholic Church. It was founded to help Zimbabwean refugees. Her exile lasted until all detentions were lifted in February 1980 under the process leading to the independence of Zimbabwe. The trust relocated from London to Zimbabwe and Todd was appointed director, a position she held until 1987. The trust's focus shifted to humanitarian aid, especially relocation and training of liberation war ex-combatants.Richard Saunders, Judith Garfield Todd Biography David Krut Publishing, South Africa, 19 August 2009. In 1984 Todd was raped by a senior officer in Mugabe's military on his orders, after she criticised the genocide of Ndebele civilians, the traditional opponents of Mugabe's own tribe. She became a strong critic of the regime of Robert Mugabe. After an unsuccessful candidature for a seat in parliament for the Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU) she worked as a journalist. She was a founding shareholder of the Daily News newspaper in 1999. The newspaper was banned in 2003 and, in the same year, Todd was stripped of her Zimbabwean citizenship.

It is present in infancy and disappears as the brain matures during childhood but may reappear due to processes that disrupt the normal cortical inhibitory pathways. Therefore, it is an example of a frontal release sign. Eliciting and observing response The thenar eminence is stroked briskly with a thin stick, from proximal (edge of wrist) to distal (base of thumb) using moderate pressure. A positive response is considered if there is a single visible twitch of the ipsilateral mentalis muscle (chin muscle on the same side as the hand tested). Clinical relevance Gheorghe Marinescu and Anghel Radovici in their seminal 1920 paper hypothesized that both the afferent (receptive) and efferent (motor) arms of the reflex are on the same side (ipsilateral) to the hand stimulated; this hypothesis remains unsubstantiated. The PMR has been found to be present more frequently in various neurological conditions, both localized and diffuse. These include congenital conditions such as Down syndrome, where it is unclear whether the reflex persists throughout life, or disappears and then re-appears in association with the onset of Alzheimer disease pathology. The reflex is common in the elderly population and should not be taken as indicative of a dementing process. A study conducted in a neurosurgical in-patient population showed there is no significant association between the side of the reflex and the side of the hemispheric lesion in patients with unilateral (one-sided) reflexes and unilateral (one-sided) lesions. Primitive reflexes such as the PMR were classically viewed as signs of disorders that affect the frontal lobes; this traditional view is questionable, as the reflex has been noted, for example, in cases of one-sided temporal lobe pathology.

History  At the beginning of the 19th century, Uchgovag, a small village, in the Agdash district of the Shaki Khanate, was later called Agdash. In 1819, Shaki province was established in the place of the Shaki Khanate. Later, in accordance with the \\"Administrative reform law in the Transcaucasia\\" dated April 22(10), 1840, the province of Sheki was part of Kaspi Province, and after that it was called ‚ÄúShakinsky Uyezd‚Äù (administrative units). After the abolishment of Kaspi Province in 1846, Shakinsky Uyezd was remained in the Shamakhi governorate (since 1859, it was called the Baku province) which was previously established in the Kaspi Province, but later, Shakinsky Uyezd was removed from the Baku province and joined the newly established Yelizavetpol Province at the end of 1867. At that time, Shakinsky Uyezd was officially called \\"Nukhinsky Uyezd\\" in accordance the name of the administrative center. In 1873 a part of the territory of the Nukhinsky Uyezd was a separate Uyezd ‚Äì it was called Eresh Uyezd, and the administrative center of the Aresh Uyezd was Agdash village ( Uchkovakh ).  Cotton-growing  In 1887, the head of the Lodz Kontory, Ramendik came to Aghdash and he opened Cotton fields, set up 4 cotton-machine tools made in China and a press for the initial processing and packaging of cotton. There were seven factories, consisting of cotton- Chinese machines in Agdash, in 1897. 3100 poods of cotton were sold in the Aghdash market In 1888, and in 1892 this number reached 28,000 poods. At the end of the 19th century, Agdash became the center of cotton production, processing and sale in the whole Caucasus. Therefore, the first congress of Caucasian cotton growers was held in Agdash in 1904.  Education  One of the first educational institutions opened in Azerbaijan was the Russian-Tatar school founded by educator Suleyman Gayibov in Agdash on October 25, 1882. It is not accidental that one of the three schools in Azerbaijan at that time was opened in Aghdash. Because before that, there were up to 20 madrasah in Aghdas until that time which gave education to people. The status of the city was given to Aghdash village, in 1900. At the beginning of the 20th century, educational institutions operated in Agdash such as the \\"N…ô≈üri-Maarif\\" -society, reading-room, \\"Saadat\\" girls' school, \\"Darulirfan\\" and \\"Rushdiye\\".

During the DaTSCAN procedure it is injected into a patient and viewed with a gamma camera in order to acquire SPECT images of the brain with particular respect to the striatum, a subcortical region of the basal ganglia. The drug is sold under the tradename DaTscan and is manufactured by GE Healthcare, formerly Amersham plc. It is not marketed outside Europe and the United States.SPECT DaTSCAN showing normal Ioflupane (123I) uptake in the striatum. Pharmacology Datscan is a solution of ioflupane (123I) for injection into a living test subject. The iodine introduced during manufacture is a radioactive isotope, iodine-123, and it is the gamma decay of this isotope that is detectable to a gamma camera. 123I has a half-life of approximately 13 hours and a gamma photon energy of 159 keV making it an appropriate radionuclide for medical imaging. The solution also contains 5% ethanol to aid solubility and is supplied sterile since it is intended for intravenous use. Ioflupane has a high binding affinity for presynaptic dopamine transporters (DAT) in the brains of mammals, in particular the striatal region of the brain. A feature of Parkinson's disease is a marked reduction in dopaminergic neurons in the striatal region. By introducing an agent that binds to the dopamine transporters a quantitative measure and spatial distribution of the transporters can be obtained. Method of administration The Datscan solution is supplied ready to inject with a certificate stating the calibration activity and time. The nominal injection activity is 185 MBq and a scan should not be performed with less than 111 MBq. Thyroid blocking via oral administration of 120 mg potassium iodide is recommended to minimize unnecessary excessive uptake of radioiodine. This is typically given 1‚Äì4 hours before the injection. The most convenient way to administer the IV dose is via a peripheral intravenous cannula. The scan is carried out 3 to 6 hours post injection. Risks Common side effects of ioflupane (123I) are headache, vertigo, increased appetite and formication. Less than 1% of patients experience pain at the injection site. The radiation risks are reported as low. The committed effective dose for a single investigation on a 70 kg individual is 4.6 mSv. Pregnant patients should not undergo the test. It is not known if 123I-ioflupane is secreted in breast milk however it is recommended that breastfeeding is interrupted for three days after administration.

The grapes are then pressed and go through partial fermentation where it is halted by the addition grape spirits. The wine is then aged in oak in a system resembling the Sherry solera system. Similar to Madeira, the wines are often exposed to high temperatures. Classification system In 1995, a syndicate of producers in Rutherglen established a voluntary four-tier classification and regulation system for their Muscat wines based on age, sweetness and complexity. At the lowest classification is the wine styled Rutherglen Muscat followed by Classic Muscat and Grand Muscat. At the highest end and meant to indicate a richer and more complex wine is the Rare Muscat. Classic Muscat is an average of five to ten years old with a residual sugar of 180-240 g/l. Grand Muscat's average age is ten to fifteen years and has a residual sugar level of 270-400 g/l. Rare Muscat is aged a minimum of twenty years and has a residual sugar level of 270-400 g/l.

Her conning tower was protected by four inches of armour. Construction and service Bellona, the sixth ship of that name, was ordered as part of the 1907 Naval Programme and was laid down on No. 5 Slipway at Pembroke Royal Dockyard on 15 June 1908 by Mrs. Kingsford, wife of the Captain-Superintendent of the dockyard, Rear-Admiral Henry Kingsford. The ship was launched on 20 March 1909 by Lady Leonora, wife of John Philips, Baron St Davids.Phillips, pp. 291‚Äì92 She was completed in February 1910 under the command of Captain Edwyn Alexander-Sinclair, commander of the 2nd Destroyer Flotilla. He was relieved by Captain The Honourable Hubert Brand on 7 February 1911. Captain Reginald Tyrwhitt replaced him on 10 August 1912. The ship had been transferred to the 1st Battle Squadron as of 18 June 1913 and Captain Percy Royds assumed command on 5 July. She was still assigned to the 1st Battle Squadron of the Grand Fleet in Scapa Flow at the start of World War I.Corbett, Vol. I, p. 439; Vol. II, pp. 412, 417 On 17 December 1914, Bellona collided with the destroyer leader , although both ships were seriously damaged, no lives were lost.Jellicoe, pp. 180‚Äì81 Captain Arthur Dutton relieved Royds on 24 April 1916. Bellona was at the Battle of Jutland but was assigned to a position at the rear of the squadron and did not fire her guns.Corbett, Vol. III, p. 345 Dutton was relieved in his turn by Captain Claud Sinclair on 28 August and was replaced by Captain Ernest Denison on 1 February 1917. The ship was on detached duty by May, probably for her conversion to a minelayer the following month, and was briefly assigned to the 4th Battle Squadron by July before rejoining the 1st Battle Squadron in August. Bellonas stay was destined to short-lived as the ship was transferred to the 2nd Battle Squadron by October.

Some time later, Eleni and Petros are together again on a beautiful day, but she has to go and so she leaves for her secret workplace: The Red Lanterns. There, Eleni and many other girls work as prostitutes. They look out of God's path but they are sensitive and kindhearted. Every one of them has her own story: Eleni, the protagonist, originates from Romania and travelled to Greece looking for a better life; however, because of choices she has made she is now the most famous of the prostitutes. Anna is a young woman in love with Captain Nicholas. She has a child with him but he doesn't know. Mary (Mairi Chronopoulou) is the eldest of them and the most \\"masculine\\" in manners. A young customer named Angelos falls in love with her and soon they begin a passionate love affair. Marina, a girl from a village far away from Athens, is madly in love with Doris, her \\"manager\\".

Soon, another woman joins their \\"home.\\" Myrsine is a 16-year-old girl who becomes one of them after being pursued by a cop. Michalis tries to seduce her but doesn't succeed. After Captain Nicholas leaves, Anna tells Helen that she has a child with him and that no one knows. Anna then tells her son Alex the truth about his father and waits for Captain Nicholas' return. On Christmas Eve, Angelos proposes to Mary, but she, laughingly, rejects him. Doris leaves Marina, who is crying and screaming, threatening to kill herself. Eleni arrives at the Christmas party after having had a romantic dinner with Petros. Petros follows her and when he discovers her secret he beats her. Crying, she tries to explain everything, but he leaves crying, too. After everything that's happened, The Red Lanterns close down. Anna awaits a letter from Captain Nicholas, but she discovers that the entire Eternal Ship crew, including Captain Nicholas, died in a storm. Mary, Marina, and Myrsine try to find a place of their own so they can continue working. Michalis once again tries to seduce Eleni, but she and Petros reunite and are happier than ever.

It was the first cruise ship to sink there, when she struck an iceberg on 23 November 2007. All passengers and crew were rescued. The ship was commissioned and operated by the Swedish explorer Lars-Eric Lindblad. Its 1969 expeditionary cruise to Antarctica was the forerunner for today's sea-based tourism in that region.Mar 28 ‚Äì Hump Day , British Antarctic Survey.Scope of Antarctic Tourism ‚Äî A Background Presentation , IAATO official website. The vessel was originally named MS Lindblad Explorer (until 1985), and MS Society Explorer until 1992. Ownership of the vessel changed several times, the last owner being the Toronto-based travel company G.A.P Adventures which acquired Explorer in 2004. Explorer was abandoned in the early hours of 23 November 2007 after taking on water near the South Shetland Islands in the Southern Ocean, an area which is usually stormy but was calm at the time. Explorer was confirmed by the Chilean Navy to have sunk at approximate position 62¬∞ 24‚Ä≤ South, 57¬∞ 16‚Ä≤ West, between South Shetlands and Grahams Land, in the Bransfield Strait, where the depth is roughly 600 m.MV EXPLORER Cruise Ship Sinking In South Atlantic, The Shipping Times, 23 November 2007 The Royal Navy Antarctic Patrol Ship , at the request of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office whilst carrying out a hydrographic survey for the British Antarctic Survey, later pinpointed Explorer final resting place as 62¬∞ 24‚Ä≤ 17.57‚Ä≥ South, 57¬∞ 11‚Ä≤ 46.49‚Ä≥ West at an approximate depth of 1,130 m, a distance of 4,373 m from her reported sinking position. This is broadly consistent with the direction of the prevailing current. History Tourists at Deception Island (2006) Explorer was commissioned by Lars-Eric Lindblad, the Swedish-American pioneer of exotic expedition tours, and built in 1969 at Uudenkaupungin Telakka shipyard in Uusikaupunki, Finland. The ship was built to stay afloat with two compartments filled with water. Her original Finnish-Swedish ice class was 1C, which is relatively weak. It is not known when the ice class was uprated to 1A. The vessel was originally named Lindblad Explorer after Lars-Eric Lindblad and was the first custom built expeditionary cruise ship. On 11 February 1972 Explorer ran aground near La Plaza Point, Antarctica; her passengers, Lars- Eric Lindblad among them, were rescued by the Chilean Navy.Lars-Eric Lindblad, 67, Pioneer Of Tours to Exotic Destinations, The New York Times, 13 July 1994. She was towed to Buenos Aires, Argentina and then to Kristiansand, Norway, for repairs.Erik Langeland On 25 December 1979, Lindblad Explorer ran aground off Wiencke Island in the Antarctic. The 70 passengers and 34 of the crew were rescued by the Chilean Navy Antarctic transport Pioto Pardo, leaving the captain and a skeleton crew of 21 on board to await the arrival of a tug. In 1984, Explorer was the first cruise ship to navigate the Northwest Passage. In 1989 she was involved in the rescue of the crew of an Argentine supply ship that had hit a rock ledge off Anvers Island, Antarctica. In 1998, Explorer was the first ship to circumnavigate James Ross Island; and the same year, she is claimed to have been the first ship, as distinct from river boat, to sail above Iquitos, Peru, to the point where the Mara√±√≥n and Ucayali rivers meet to become the Amazon River.M/S Explorer Explorer was depicted on at least two postage stamps issued by South Georgia and one issued by the Falkland Islands.Philatelie Polaire South Georgia stamps.Falkland Isles Stamp Explorer was nicknamed \\"the Little Red Ship\\".

After visiting the Falkland Islands and South Georgia she hit an iceberg in the Bransfield Strait close to King George Island in the Southern Ocean, near the South Shetland Islands, on 23 November 2007. The object struck by Explorer made a gash in the hull which allowed water to enter. The Argentine navy later said in a statement it observed \\"significant\\" damage. The official report of the sinking noted: \\"The damage sustained had to have extended along the length of the vessel from Cabins 308 to 314 for at least a distance of 3.6 meters, and, in all likelihood, had punctured and sliced holes along the shell plating.\\" Passengers on Explorer reported a loud \\"bang\\" at the time of impact, although others reported that there had been no noticeable impact, or at least nothing more than the normal crunching of ice experienced when sailing through icy waters.

A mayday call was put out by the ship at 04:24 UTC, and rescue operations were quickly coordinated by the Prefectura Naval (Coast Guard Corps) of Argentina and the Chilean Navy Center for Search and Rescue. Chile dispatched the icebreaker Almirante Viel, and nearby commercial ships including the MN Ushuaia, the National Geographic Endeavor, and the Norwegian Coastal Express ship which was operating as a passenger cruise ship at the time.

The evacuees drifted for 5 hours until they were picked up by the Norwegian ship MS Nordnorge which arrived on scene at approximately 10:00 UTC. All of those rescued by Nordnorge were taken to the Chilean Frei Montalva Station on King George Island where they were subsequently airlifted by C-130 Hercules transport aircraft of the Chilean Air Force to Punta Arenas, Chile in two separate flights, one on Saturday 24 November and the other on Sunday 25 November. Those passengers not taken to Punta Arenas (an estimated 70) were taken to Uruguay's Artigas Base. Explorer was completely submerged at 19:00 UTC, approximately 20 hours after the initial impact and damage to her hull. Explorer was designed, like most ships, with compartments which could be sealed off by watertight doors; the ship would not sink if holed and one compartment flooded, but was not safe if more compartments were flooded, either by a gash spanning compartments or imperfect sealing between compartments. GAP reported that there was a crack in addition to the hole, but it is not clear if it spanned compartments.International Herald Tribune In an article published on 8 December 2007, experts consider that Explorer was \\"perfect for ice navigation\\", and consider that the explanation of the sinking \\"doesn't add up\\" and that \\"essential pieces of the story are missing\\". Investigation The investigation into the sinking of Explorer was carried out by the Liberian Bureau of Maritime Affairs. The report into the accident was released in April 2009. The report cites the decision by Captain Bengt WimanWall Street Journal, Feb. 16-17, 2019, pg.B8, age 49, to enter the ice field based on his knowledge and information available at the time as the primary reason why Explorer was so severely damaged. \\"He was under the mistaken impression that he was encountering first year ice which in fact, as the Chilean Navy Report indicated, was much harder land ice.\\" Passengers reported seeing red paint on the passing ice less than thirty minutes prior to when the flooding was reported, another indication that the vessel was passing through compact and hard ice. The Master of Explorer was very experienced in Baltic waters but he was unfamiliar with the type of ice he encountered in Antarctic waters. The report praises the performance of the master and crew in organizing and evacuating the passengers, and notes that lives were likely saved due to the actions of these individuals.

Biography Juan was born on September 14, 1893, in the \\"Casa Grande\\" of Real of Monte, state of Hidalgo, Mexico. Eduardo was born on October 27, 1894. Their father was Andr√©s Aldasoro, Minister of Promotion under Porfirio D√≠az and was general manager of the \\"Las Dos Estrellas\\" mine in the state of Michoac√°n. The inseparable brothers alternated their studies of preparatory with their vocation being mechanics and a passion for flying, and through publications and magazines of those days time they inquired researched about everything related to aviation. Aircraft builders By 1908 they began to design and construct their first gliders, which were tested on fields near the Piedad Cemetery (Pante√≥n de la Piedad, now Avenida Cuauht√©moc in Mexico City). They achieved brilliant results as they managed to fly about one hundred meters in their own designed gliders. They used diverse methods for the propulsion: the glider was towed by a steam automobile that reached a terminal velocity of 50 km/hour. The structure of the plane was made of wood, the wings were covered by a blanket hardened with engrudo and the landing gear was adapted from steel tubes and bicycle wheels. The gliders were cautiously hidden, to avoid someone else stealing their design by covering them with linen cloths. The tests were performed at different hours, mainly at dawn. For his first flights he used leader mandiles for protection, since the gliders were severely damaged after each flight. First flights March 9, 1909, was a very important day for the Aldasoro brothers; that day they took the glider towards the outskirts of Mexico City, nowadays Calle de Quer√©taro in Colonia Roma. This was the first street to be opened in the neighbourhood and for them it represented a nice track without obstacles. They tied the glider to a steam car called \\"White\\", which was the fastest automobile of those days. Juan Pablo would be the pilot and his brother Eduardo would be in charge of driving the car that would tow the glider. As they started moving, a huge cloud of dust arose, the glider slowly elevated the tail and finally emerged from the cloud. The car continued moving for about 300 meters and then slowly decreased the speed to allow the glider to loosen the cable and then continue flying. Suddenly something unexpected happened. The device to release the cable did not work properly and Juan Pablo went flying above the car without being able to free himself. As the plane continued, the cable pulled it back and immediately turned in a somersault and crashed. The glider was destroyed and, miraculously, Juan Pablo was alive with only a fractured leg. The experience drawn from this flight was extraordinary, the pilot had managed to have absolute control of the glider for more than 480 meters as well as a very stable flight at a height of 10 meters. This accident and others undergone by Eduardo, did not discouraged them at all. On the contrary, having seen that their planes were able to fly, they decided to construct an engine that could be adapted into an aeroplane. With this intention in mind, they travelled to the mine of \\"Las Dos Estrellas\\", in Tlalpujahua, Michoac√°n, where his father was the manager. They took with them drafts and designs and used the mine's welding and smelting facilities to construct an internal combustion engine with two opposite cylinders. At that time, the existing engines were very heavy and voluminous, they had enormous radiators for cooling, and many of accessories that did not satisfy the required characteristics to propel an aeroplane. Finally, in January 1911 they finished the construction and testing of the motor, cooled by air, it could develop 60 h.p., and up to 900 RPM. The prime feature was its weight/power ratio: 3 kilos per hp. In addition, the Aldasoro brothers constructed a very rudimentary wind tunnel to help them study the process of flying. They experimented with different shapes and angles for the wings as well as their centre of gravity. Years before other European designers, they designed the \\"thick wing\\", which was highly efficient. They had improved aerodynamics of the airplane. Once assembled all the components, the aeroplane complete with engine was ready to be tested. Higher calling Newspaper article from February 1913 describing the arrival of the Aldasoro Brothers at the Moisant Aviation School When the aeroplane was finished, President Francisco I. Madero's War Minister General Angel Garc√≠a Pe√±a, inspected the plane very carefully. He decided that before testing it, Juan Pablo and Eduardo Aldasoro should be granted a scholarship by the Government of Mexico to attend the Moisant aviation school in New York. The President of Mexico, Don Francisco I. Madero, was a progressive and visionary man, he thought that aviation offered great possibilities to create a modern army, about which the vocation, the professional formation and a pure patriotic spirit of youth, served as incentive to renew people, styles and customs of the past. Then, the Aldasoro brothers, accompanied by Alberto Salinas Carranza, Gustavo Salinas Cami√±a and Horacio Ruiz, travelled to the USA and were the first Mexicans to graduate as pilots on March 12, 1913. The F√©d√©ration A√©ronautique Internationale granted the licenses nbr. 217 to Juan Pablo Aldasoro and nbr. 218 to Eduardo Aldasoro. On the graduation day, the authorities authorised one of the recent pilots to fly over the Statue of Liberty. Juan Pablo won the draw and took off from the training fields at Long Island NY, he completed the flight, above the waters with total control and security, he reached the Statue, and returned to the fields as the first man to fly over this famous New York symbol. Newspapers and magazines recorded the event with great detail. The New York Council granted a diploma to Juan Pablo Aldasoro in memory of the event and the airplane's propeller is now kept in the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C., where it pays tribute to these pilots who contributed with courage and sacrifice to the history of aviation. Early Birds Aeroplane built by Juan Pablo Aldasoro Mexico City, 1909. As Juan Pablo and Eduardo Aldasoro flew \\"solo\\" before 1916, they are recognized as part of the Early Birds of Aviation. President Madero did not have the opportunity to see his dream fulfilled, but those five pioneers, Juan Pablo and Eduardo Aldasoro, Alberto and Gustavo Salinas and Horacio Ruiz, would become the pillars of the Mexican Air Force, not only as founders, but also teachers for the next generation of pilots. The Department of Military Aeronautics, the School, the National Factories of Aeronautical Constructions and the Mexican Air Force, regarded them as pillars and guides. In these institutions they committed their lives and work. Deaths Juan Pablo Aldasoro Su√°rez died on October 4, 1962, with the rank of Lieutenant Colonel Flying Pilot. Eduardo Aldasoro Su√°rez died on November 10, 1968, with the rank of General Brigadier Flying Pilot.

The path crosses a variety of landscapes, such as the dune system at Ynyslas, high cliffs, storm beaches, sandy bays and sea caves. The path passes through small villages and some well-known tourist resorts and offers a close insight into this stretch of coast, recently officially opened up to walkers via this route, some parts of which are still under development. There are four sections that are designated as Heritage Coast, and two areas within Cardigan Bay are marine Special Areas of Conservation because of their importance for wildlife.\\"Ceredigion's Coast Path Awaits You!.\\" Ceredigion Coast Path.

Some of the sections are challenging, given the undulating nature of the path, but some of the flatter sections are quite suitable for walkers of lesser or limited ability.

Introduced in 2004, it initially carried 1,000 passengers a year and only ran in the summer. This figure had risen to 4,600 by 2010. As a result of this success, the service was extended to operate all year round (six days a week over the summer and three days a week at other times) from 2012 until September 2014, with funding from the Rural Development Plan.

His professional career as a 5-string banjoist began in 1953 when he joined Smokey Graves & His Blue Star Boys, who had a regular show at a radio station in Crewe, Virginia. Between 1953-57, he founded or played with different bands in Virginia and Washington DC, such as his Virginia Playboys, Smokey Graves and the Blue Star Boys, Bill Harrell, and Mac Wiseman's Country Boys. Bill Monroe offered a job to Adcock in 1958, and he played with the Blue Grass Boys until he could no longer survive on bluegrass' declining pay due to the onslaught of Elvis Presley who cornered all music markets. Adcock continued in music and also returned to working a variety of day jobs including auto mechanic, dump truck driver, and sheet metal mechanic. Then Charlie Waller and John Duffey asked Adcock to join their struggling new band, The Country Gentlemen, whereupon their vocal and instrumental synergy prompted a reinvention and elevation of their sound, soon revitalizing bluegrass music itself.Eddie Adcock profile, answers.com; accessed October 30, 2015. They are the first group to be inducted, in 1996, into the International Bluegrass Music Association's Hall of Fame as a band entity. Adcock has performed with his wife Martha since 1973 in bands II Generation - the first definitively newgrass group - then as Eddie & Martha Adcock, country rock band Adcock, bluegrass' Talk of the Town, The Masters, the Country Gentlemen Reunion Band, and the Eddie Adcock Band, as well as with country outlaw David Allan Coe. Most recently he tours almost exclusively with wife Martha and calls Lebanon, Tennessee his home. Eddie belongs to a number of business organizations, including IBMA and the Folk Alliance. He has served on the Board of Directors of the IBMA, Tennessee Banjo Institute and others. Eddie and Martha also founded and ran Adcock Audio, a large, state-of-the-art sound company, serving bluegrass-related festivals from the early '70s until 2006, and from that time until the present have also recorded and produced themselves and others both outside and in-house at their own SunFall Studio. Early years Learning to play on numerous instruments brought into the home by an older brother, young Eddie, with his brother Frank, played and sang as a duo in local churches and on radio stations in nearby Charlottesville. Eddie sold a calf he raised to buy his first banjo as a young teenager and immediately began touring regionally with Smokey Graves. His hobbies were boxing and drag-racing cars. As a racer, Adcock racked up 34 straight wins with his car, which he named Mr. Banjo; he also set two track records at Manassas, Virginia.. He also performed various blue-collar jobs to pay the rent. All the while, he played music at night.Eddie Adcock profile, answers.com; accessed October 30, 2015. With the Country Gentlemen The Country Gentlemen originated in Washington, D.C. as the result of an automobile accident involving members of singer Buzz Busby's band, which included Eddie Adcock. To fulfill upcoming dates, member Bill Emerson called other musicians to step in; and due to the injured members' long recovery times the substitute band decided to stay together, soon naming themselves the Country Gentlemen. The band‚Äôs original members were Bill Emerson on banjo and baritone vocals, Charlie Waller on guitar and lead vocals, John Duffey on mandolin and tenor vocals, and Larry Lahey on bass. Soon after Adcock's arrival the band settled into an undeniably synergistic lineup consisting of Adcock, Waller, and Duffey, with Tom Gray on bass. This particular lineup, with Adcock serving as sparkplug, became known as the 'classic' Country Gentlemen, the team who drove the bluegrass sound and repertoire to new levels of experimentation, expertise, and excitement. During his tenure with the Country Gentlemen, Adcock adapted thumbstyle, or \\"Travis-style\\", guitar finger picking and pedal steel guitar playing to the banjo, which remain unique innovations on the instrument. In addition, his driving, percussive and syncopated jazz-based single-string, soulful string-bending, and lush chordal approaches were at the heart of the group's new-form bluegrass instrumental style, as developed in the interplay between Adcock's mind-blowing fireworks- like innovations, Duffey's jazzy mandolin licks, and Waller's forceful guitar rhythm. Additionally, Adcock's powerful, assertive baritone singing also set a new standard in bluegrass trio singing and became an much-emulated model. The Country Gentlemen's style and repertoire fundamentally changed bluegrass, and the group was notably the first newgrass-slanted band and arguably the forerunner of modern bluegrass as a whole. Then Eddie met Martha In 1970 Eddie left The Country Gentlemen and moved to California, where he formed a country-rock band called The Clinton Special. While he performed with the group he used the pseudonym Clinton Codack. Returning east and forming II Generation, he met Martha HearonProfile, CMT.com; accessed October 30, 2015. in 1973; they would marry three years later and have remained partners in music and life, garnering fans and great acclaim while touring worldwide in nearly a dozen countries from Europe to Japan. The dynamic duo of Eddie and Martha Adcock has become known as ‚Äúthe biggest little band in Bluegrass‚Äù. Cashbox magazine and Billboard magazine have both named them ‚Äúone of the Bluegrass circuit's top acts‚Äù. Eddie and Martha have recorded a number of well-received albums on several labels and concentrate on performing as a duo, as well as playing some concerts with bassist Tom Gray. Eddie and Martha, AKA The Adcocks, have appeared on Austin City Limits, Song of the Mountains, Grassroots to Bluegrass, Ernest Tubb's Midnite Jamboree, TNN's 'Nashville Now' and Wildhorse Saloon, and a host of NPR specials, as well as syndicated, Internet, and local TV and radio shows worldwide. Their video Dog aired on TNN, CMT, and CNN. Surgery In October 2008, concerns about hand-tremors, which could have compromised his performing career, led to Eddie having deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. A local anesthetic having been used during the surgery so that he could remain conscious, he was able to play banjo during the procedure in order to check the effectiveness of the treatment in progress.Profile, BBC.co.uk; accessed October 30, 2015. This ground-breaking surgery is the first to have been performed on a musician for the purpose of restoring his professional-level playing ability; and the resulting television, newspaper, radio and internet publicity has been seen and heard globally, fascinating and amazing the entire world.

Career Gardner showed some promise during early days of televised darts - although the only title he won was the Belgian Open in 1984, which was a non- televised event. He reached the last 16 of the Winmau World Masters in 1985 and then qualified for the World Professional Darts Championship for the first time in 1986 where he lost in the first round to Terry O'Dea. It was the first year the tournament was staged at the Lakeside Country Club. He failed to progress beyond the second round in his visits to Lakeside, but did come up against some legends of the game including Eric Bristow, Jocky Wilson and Mike Gregory. He managed to reach the quarter finals of the World Masters in 1990 - but by this time, that tournament was no longer televised. Only the World Championship remained on the screens during that era, which was one of the reasons that many top players became unhappy with their lack of television exposure. Gardner was amongst the group of 16 players who \\"defected\\" from the British Darts Organisation between 1992 and 1994 as one of the founder members of the World Darts Council (now the Professional Darts Corporation - PDC) and he received more television exposure between 1994 and 1999 at their World Championship - but never managed to progress beyond the group stages. He also competed in the WDC/PDC's World Matchplay tournament in 1994, 1995, 1996 and 1998 - but never won a single match. After the 1999 World Championship he faded from the scene and no longer competes on the darts circuit - although he did compete at a couple of PDC Open events in Eastbourne in 2005 and 2006 but never progressed beyond the very early rounds.

Founded in 1989, it was the first commercial TV station in the Soviet Union (USSR). Since then, the channel predominantly broadcasts foreign animated TV series, including anime and Adult Swim shows. History Trial period (July ‚Äî November 1989) 2x2 was established by order of the USSR State Radio and Television as a structural unit within the General Directorate of Programs (GDP). The state initially had four people: Sergey Alexeev (Director), Olga Smirnova, Oleg Schoor (Director) and Olga Lukasik (Administrator) . In August 1989, Sergey Lavrov also joined the team as an administrator. The channel broadcast its first pilot in July 1989, under the name \\"Commercial Channel\\" . Broadcasting was conducted during the daytime due to the fact that the state \\"Moscow\\" was broadcast in the evening on the same frequency. Length esters , called \\"Commercial Television Channel,\\" were not fixed. Music videos that were broadcast included, \\"All She Wants Is\\" by Duran Duran, \\"Always on My Mind,\\" by the group Pet Shop Boys, \\"Pendant que les champs br√ªlent,\\" by the group Niagara, \\"Everywhere,\\" by Fleetwood Mac, \\"Around My Heart,\\" by singer Sandra, \\"The Soldier,\\" by Thomas Anders, \\"Mon mec √† moi,\\" by Patricia Kaas, as well as fragments of the concert \\"Space in Moscow.\\" At this time, the channel's staff was limited to a small room \\"No. 115\\" behind a bar. to ask three (Olympic television and radio) and two hardware and essential installation, APB 8, and AWSM 6-1 . 1989‚Äî1997 The name \\"2x2\\" was coined by the team around the end of July 1989, at the same time, Sergey Moiseyev (the only artist in the team) developed the General style of the channel and the original version of the logo, which still exists with minor changes. On November 1, 1989, 2x2 TV channel began broadcasting under its own name. On the Moscow program channel of the Central television station, later- MTK. In the evening (from 18:00 to 23:00), the TV channel \\"MTK\\" was broadcast. At the initial stage of operation, the TV channel did not have money for the production and purchase of programs, so the broadcast network was filled with materials obtained through the personal connections and capabilities of its managers. The broadcast featured half-hour or more ad blocks, an ad clip from Video international, modern Soviet and foreign music videos and cartoons (in particular, the Soviet TV show \\"Screen\\"). later, the TV series \\"Captain Power and the soldiers of the future\\"was shown and repeated many times. The series \\"I Spy\\" was also broadcast. In addition,\\" 2x2 \\" also showed a selection of domestic music videos, starting with the clip of Oleg Beskrovny \\"A knock in the heart\\" (the main character of this selection was Igor Talkov). Among other videos shown by the channel were clips of the Alla Pugacheva song theater from the Video international company, \\" Accountant \\"by the Combination group,\\" Arab gold \\"by the Forgotten conversation group,\\" Street of love \\"and\\" Ksenia \\"by Alena Apina. In the program \\"Afisha\\" with DJ Ale-Alena, which also broadcast video clips of Russian artists such as Bogdan Titomir and Oleg Gazmanov. From the first day of broadcast have been broadcast by Sergei Selenourea ‚Äî \\"Batalla!\\". The lack of a rigid broadcast grid and the format of six-time repeats of the same block of entertainment programs and advertising, which were the result of limited financial opportunities and a small number of programs at the disposal of \\"2x2\\", largely played a role in the growth of its popularity. The channel broadcast in the format of so-called \\"background television\\", when viewing which the viewer could not pay attention to the picture shown on the screen, or even start watching the channel at any moment, without specifically catching a particular TV program. TV sets in offices, shops, cafes, and other public places and institutions were often tuned to \\"2x2\\". At that time, \\"2x2\\" was the only domestic TV channel that often showed music videos, which strongly distinguished it from the General background of several existing Soviet TV channels. The channel was very popular among Soviet schoolchildren, who most often, while waiting for a 20-minute show of music videos, viewed ad blocks that sometimes lasted for 40 minutes without a break. According to a survey of 586 high school students in Moscow schools conducted at the end of 1991, the channel became the leader in popularity: it was watched by 34.16% of respondents.¬´–£—á–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å—Å–∫–∞—è –≥–∞–∑–µ—Ç–∞¬ª ‚Ññ 49, 1991 –≥. –°.2 From June 1990 to May 31, 1992, the channel aired programs from the British Super Channel. One of these programs was Blue Night. Their share in the broadcast network almost immediately became impressive ‚Äî one-or two-hour selections of video clips were broadcast (the program All Mixed Up; the hit parade SPIN WIN, made up of modern popular video clips[source not specified 1169 days]), thematic programs (music, fashion, sports), movies. Some educational programs were also broadcast, including those produced by the Discovery Channel, including \\"After 2000\\". Since mid-1991, the anime \\"macron 1\\"began to be shown. Since July 2, 1992, instead of the daytime show of feature films of Central television, the channel began to carry out reruns of series going to MTK, the first of which was the TV series \\"no One but you\\". Starting around 1992, the channel began to broadcast a program about heavy and rock music \\"Green Corridor\\", produced by the production Studio\\" BIZ Enterprises \\" entrepreneur Boris Zosimov. In the future, the music policy of the channel almost completely came under the control of this person, as a result of which in 1993 the channel's management signed a contract with the owners of the TV channel \\"MTV Europe\\" to retransmit some of the channel's programs (for example, on the night of January 1, 1994, a concert by the band ABBA was shown). at first, clips from the European broadcast of MTV were broadcast during the day between series and other programs. At first, recordings of MTV broadcasts were broadcast quite often, including VJ blocks, often even without translation. Among the programs were issues of the animated series \\"Beavis and Butthead\\". Soon, paid clips of Russian artists, such as Vlad Stashevsky and Yevgeny Kemerovo, began to occupy more and more MTV clips. By the summer of 1994, there was a daily hour-long selection of clips from MTV (aired in the afternoon), which soon disappeared as well. Music videos, but no longer from MTV, were occasionally broadcast in the future,still in between series. Despite the fact that some of Zosimov's ideas (MTV) did not justify themselves, he continued to occupy a part of the air, creating a TV company- producer \\"BIZ-TV\\", within which a number of music programs were released and almost all the music component of the channel was formed. Also in the framework of this project, the program \\"Forgotten names\\", dedicated to the Soviet stage, was aired, later moved to the TV-6 channel, where it was aired as part of the program \\"Disk-channel\\" as \\"Spinning disks\\". The hosts of the program were Kirill Nemolyaev and Nikolay Semashko. In 1993, \\"2x2\\" first appeared on the satellite, which resulted in the retransmission (in recording) of its broadcasts by some regional partners. Prior to its launch on satellite, the channel broadcast only in Moscow and the region, and through its own transmitters in Tver and Ryazan, with real-time signal delivery via ground- based RRL. In 1993‚Äì1994, \\"2x2\\" also regularly showed commercials of the organization \\"Greenpeace\\", and therefore on the air of this channel you could often see Joanna Stingray and Boris Grebenshchikov. In 1993, \\"2x2\\" newscasts appeared. In 1994, the main character of the compilation of clips was Philip Kirkorov. During the days of mourning, a video was broadcast for the song \\"my Country\\", which was included in Kirkorov's album \\"I am not Raphael\\"[source not specified 2039 days].

The issues were translated into Russian by Peter Kartsev, a VHS translator who also worked for TV-6. In 1994, the channel had problems with the Australian TV series \\"chances\\", which gradually moved from the usual melodrama to a more explicit erotic genre. In 1994‚Äì1995, the channel reached a peak of popularity due to a diverse broadcast network, as well as programs such as \\"Dandy ‚Äî the New reality\\" and animated series such as \\"teenage mutant ninja Turtles\\". In 1995, according to opinion polls, Channel One was significantly inferior to channel 2x2 in daytime. Later, in 1996, for the first time in Russia began showing the anime \\"sailor Moon\\", as well as telenovelas of Mexican origin \\"no One but you\\", \\"My second mother\\" and \\"Crossroads\\", series\\" Thunder in Paradise\\",\\" Highlander \\"and\\" Sledgehammer\\",\\"lassie\\". Broadcasting of 2x2 on 3 TVC ended at midnight on the night of June 8 to 9, 1997 due to the expiration of license number 15 of June 8, 1992, issued for 5 years. 7:00 GMT on 9 June, the channel lost its place on the \\"third button\\" new TV channels \\"TV Center\\" and \\"Muscovy\\", moving in the UHF range, 51 TVK, where from 7:00 to 11:00 and from 19:00 to 3:00 on weekdays and from 9:00 to 14:00 and from 19:00 to 3:00 at weekends was saying \\"Muz-TV\\". On 51 TVC \\" 2x2 \\" broadcast from 11 to 19 hours-on weekdays and from 14 to 19 hours-on weekends, with extremely low-quality content, and the predominance of \\"Shop on the couch\\". On August 14, 1997, the channel stopped broadcasting to Moscow and the region on 51 TV channels. For a long time after the closure of the old 2x2, the company \\"2x2-Telemarket\\" existed, which was the exclusive owner of the rights to a number of films, documentaries, animated series and television series broadcast by the channel until 1997, on the territory of Russia. 2002‚Äî2007 On February 27, 2002, 2x2 TV channel won a competition for 43 TV channels in Moscow with the concept of \\"Shop on the sofa\\". Initially, the launch of the channel was scheduled for November 11, 2002, but it was postponed, as it turned out that the Moscow regional center (Ostankino TV tower), which distributes the signal of Central TV channels, will be ready to start providing its services to the 2x2 channel only from January 2003. Then it turned out that the operation of the 2x2 transmitter on 43 TCEs is influenced by radio-electronic means of one of the parts of the Ministry of defense of the Russian Federation. The launch of 2x2 was postponed to January 3, 2003, but it also did not take place. In April 2003, test tests were conducted on 44 TCEs, which showed that it was suitable for broadcasting, but it was launched a few years later for the broadcasting of the St. Petersburg \\"Fifth channel\\" in Moscow. A month later, in may, members of an interagency working group made up of representatives of the Ministry of defense, the Ministry of communications and RTRS, came to the conclusion that the 2x2 channel will be allocated 60 TCEs for broadcasting. On July 7, 2003, the channel began broadcasting on 60 TV channels in Moscow in an experimental mode. Since September 1 of the same year, the channel has been fully broadcast. Since the first days of broadcasting \\"revived\\" 2x2, most of the TV channel's airtime was made up of programs of the popular TV channel about fashion \\"Fashion TV\\" and clips of domestic performers produced by the production Studio \\"Difficult Childhood\\". The name of the program was named after a popular song by Vladimir Markin \\"Lilac fog\\". Legally, the new 2x2 was not related to the old TV channel, which was closed in 1997 ‚Äî its founder was ZAO \\"TV channel 2x2-Moscow\\".–°–ø—Ä–∞–≤–∫–∞ –æ —Ç–µ–ª–µ–∫–∞–Ω–∞–ª–µ 2—Ö2 The new 2x2 defined its concept as \\"television for the active consumer\\", a kind of TV guide to the market of goods and services. According to the prescribed concept, 50% of the broadcasting of the \\" new \\" channel 2x2 was occupied by the retransmission of the programs of the Fashion TV channel. Programs of our own production were intended for a youth audience. The channel was aimed at an audience of up to 45 years old with an income above $300, who pay great attention to their lifestyle. In accordance with the concept, the TV channel refused in principle to introduce information, social, socio-political or criminal programs into its broadcast network. In 2004, the TV channel \\"Style TV\\", concluded a long- term cooperation agreement with the TV channel 2x2. In the same year, the channel's frequency was used to rebroadcast the programs of its network partner, Style TV, with the logo \\" 2x2 \\" (interrupting broadcasting to the TV store). By 2005‚Äì2006, there was a critical time on the channel: the TV store almost completely replaced the rest of the programs from the channel's broadcast grid (there was no logo, screensavers indicating the media registration certificate appeared only before music videos). Basically, in the broadcast network of the then 2x2, there were presentations of products from the TV Club TV store. The broadcast of the TV store was divided into thematic categories: from kitchen goods to fitness equipment. On Friday and Saturday nights, the channel broadcast feature films and series. Music videos were also broadcast on the broadcast network. In February 2006, 2x2 TV channel was acquired by ProfMedia holding. At the same time, 2x2 began broadcasting on the Rambler frequency of the TV Network. On October 3, 2006, the new owners presented an updated concept for broadcasting 2x2 TV channel. In turn, in early 2007, the company \\"TV Club\\", which in the spring of 2005 rented the entire network of the channel, decided to launch its TV channel on the basis of 2x2. The channel was first seen only by residents of Moscow and the Moscow region thanks to the AKADO cable network, and soon the channel became available throughout Russia. Since 2007 Since March 19, 2007, the 2x2 channel has broadcast fragments of animated series, after which it showed the time of airing, as well as a promo with the slogan \\" Turn off the brain, turn on 2x2!\\". At the bottom was the inscription \\"channel demo\\". Periodically, it was changed to the number of days remaining before the launch of the new channel. On April 1, 2007, 2x2 was finally rebranded, and the channel switched to a new broadcast format. As a result, 2x2 underwent major changes: a change of management and staff followed; the logo and graphic design were changed. The channel began to position itself as \\"the first Russian animation channel for adults\\". The cartoons shown are translated or dubbed into Russian. Some of them up to 2x2 have already been shown on other Russian channels, for example, \\"the Simpsons\\", \\"Futurama\\", \\"family Guy\\", \\"South Park\\" (REN TV), \\"Beavis and Butthead\\", \\"Star fight to the death\\" (MTV Russia). For the first few months, animated 2x2 was presented in Saint Petersburg, Moscow and the Moscow region (including in the Mostelecom package, where 2x2 was broadcast since 2005), and its expansion into the regions began in June. Broadcasting of the channel in most other regions of Russia was started on the site of the closed \\"ProfMedia\\" and exhausted educational channel \\"Rambler Teleset\\". By the end of 2007, animation 2x2 began to achieve its first success ‚Äî during the first 2 months of autumn, it managed to increase its audience and outstrip the number of youth audience of such major channels as TNT, MTV Russia and channel One. Later, 2x2 managed to attract an age group that traditionally does not watch TV ‚Äî young men and those who have long been disillusioned with TV. In 2008, the legal entity ZAO TV channel 2x2-Moscow was renamed ZAO TV and radio Company 2x2 \\". In 2010, it was re ‚Äî registered with TV and Radio company 2x2 LLC. In early 2009, the 2x2 office moved to 9 Varshavskoe shosse, p. 1. Before moving there was a textile factory. On November 30, 2010, it was announced that the channel began airing WWE RAW on February 5, 2011. The two-year contract was announced at wwe.com. wwe Management also expressed a positive opinion about the return of wwe programs on Russian television. On September 14, 2012, 2x2 began satellite broadcasting with shifts of \\"+2 MSK\\" and \\"+5 MSK\\". In February 2014, following the acquisition of 100% of ProfMedia's shares by Gazprom-media holding, the channel along with Friday!\\"and TV-3 –ü–∞–≤–µ–ª –ë–µ–ª–∞–≤–∏–Ω, –°–µ—Ä–≥–µ–π –°–æ–±–æ–ª–µ–≤. ¬´–ï–≤—Ä–æ–ø–∞ –ø–ª—é—Å¬ª –ø—Ä–∏—Å—è–¥–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ ¬´–î–æ—Ä–æ–∂–∫—É¬ª // –ö–æ–º–º–µ—Ä—Å–∞–Ω—Ç—ä, ‚Ññ 35/–ü (5308), 03 –º–∞—Ä—Ç–∞ 2014 became part of Gazprom-media. A little more than a year later, in March 2015, after a small reorganization of the holding, the channel became part of the Gazprom-media entertainment Television sub-holding( RTV), its office and the offices of TNT, TV-3 and Friday! moved to the building of the business center \\"Diamond Hall \\"(14 Olympic Avenue)\\". On January 1, 2016, the channel ceded some of its broadcast frequencies to TNT4 (before rebranding as TNT ‚Äî Comedy). However, the channel's share has not changed significantly, and the coverage has also remained Federal and national, since in most major cities it was only retransmitted on cable networks. Since 2017, episodes of the popular YouTube series \\"Meet Bob\\" from the YouTube channel of the same name have been broadcast on the channel as inter-programs. Since April 10, 2018, the channel's website has an online broadcast, which differs from the broadcast version in the absence of a progress bar (a strip showing the time remaining until the end of the transfer) and a clock; it is conducted for the Moscow time zone (+0). On November 1, 2019, the service \\"2x2 Media\\" (before it was \\"2x2 Hub\\") was launched, where you can watch content in FULL HD and uncensored on the channel's website for a subscription. There will also be projects from Adult Swim that will not be aired. Since March 19, 2020, the \\"Bazooka video Store\\" program uses the 2x2 logo of the 2003-2007 model. Controversies and criticism As the country's largest adult-oriented animation channel, 2√ó2 is prone to protest among various conservative and religious groups, and occasionally with authorities. Since 'animation' as a genre was traditionally viewed as exclusively children's media in Russia, 2√ó2 struggles with continually highlighting that its programs are not recommended for children. In February 2008, the Russian Media Culture Protection Department (Rossvyazokhrankultura), a regulatory body for TV in Russia, issued warnings about Happy Tree Friends and The Adventures of Big Jeff, claiming that the shows promote \\"violence and brutality.\\" This \\"violence and brutality\\" was claimed to harm the psychic health, moral development and social morality of children, all of this being a violation of license agreement. The department warned 2√ó2, which broadcasts the shows, to remove them in order to avoid legal issues. The owners of 2√ó2 voiced their disagreement, but reluctantly fulfilled the request. Later that year, activists of the Russian Pentecostalist Church criticized 2√ó2 for airing South Park and The Simpsons. Their appeal to close 2√ó2 was rejected by the Russian media officials. On September 24, 2008 the channel's license was extended for an additional 5 years. In July 2009, 2√ó2 cut a scene from the episode \\"Free Willzyx\\" of South Park, because it depicted Vladimir Putin as \\"a greedy and desperate leader,\\" prompting \\"criticism and furious discussion on Russia blogs\\".

Tonse village is about to the north of Mangalore. Location Tonse is bounded on its western side the Arabian Sea while on the eastern side the Suvarna river runs, creating a number of islands in its delta before it finally merges with the sea at Kodibengre. Tourism Towards the northern tip of Tonse there is Kodi Bengre where Suvarna river flows into Arabian Sea. This creates a delta with numerous islands known as Kuduru. This is popularly known as \\"Delta Beach\\". Bengre is a thin strip of land almost 4 km long and holds back the sea on the west and the river on the east. At some stretches this strip in barely 50 metres wide. In the delta of Suvarna, a group of about a dozen islands, covered with coconut palms and surrounded by clear blue waters.. Recently many House Boats are seen in the backwaters of Hoode. A hanging bridge, which attracts visitors, connects one of the better- known islands, Thimmankudru to the mainland. The Hanging Bridge was constructed by 2 Karnataka Engineer NCC and the bridge was named as Deepak in memory of a late NCC Cadet. The complete material for construction of this bridge was made available by local people from their own private funds, the bridge was designed by Officer Commanding 2 Kar Engg NCC and was constructed by NCC Cadets of REC Surathkal(NIIT), Manipal Institute of Technology and NITTE College of Engineering in the Year 1991. Total time taken to construct the Bridge was about twelve days. The piers had been constructed by local villagers prior to this. Now a new bridge is being constructed to link the island by a motorable road.

The rules for Incan Gold and Diamant are the same, but the games have other minor differences. Gameplay Players take on the role of adventurers looking for treasure in a diamond mine. Players search for diamonds while trying to avoid various hazards such as spiders and snakes. Fearful players can run out of the cave, while daring players can choose to venture on, push their luck, and risk losing the treasure they have found. After five rounds, the player with the most treasure is the winner. Differences between Incan Gold and Diamant In Diamant players are exploring a cave or diamond mine; in Incan Gold, players are exploring a temple. Incan Gold comes with artifact cards, but Diamant does not. In Diamant, players have treasure chests; in Incan Gold players have tents at their camp. In Diamant, players are searching for diamonds, but in Incan Gold, players are searching for jewels and other gems. History of Diamant According to Bruno Faidutti's website, Diamant is Faidutti's second collaboration with Alan R. Moon.Incan Gold history at Faidutti.com. Retrieved 2007-11-23 Faidutti said that they both held Can't Stop by Sid Sackson \\"in great esteem\\" and they wanted to design their own game where players would have to choose between keeping what they have or risk losing all they had acquired. Faidutti said he suggested a kind of \\"common pool Can't Stop\\" where all the players were in the same situation but could make different decisions. Faidutti described the theme as \\"somewhere between Indiana Jones and Alan Quatermain.\\" Faidutti said the first prototype of the game used an Incan or Mayan temple as the setting. The danger cards were initially frightening noises but those were changed by the publisher. Faidutti said an attempt to add action cards to the game was not successful in playtesting. Friedemann Friese suggested that the card \\"that triggered the bust\\" be removed from the game and that only one voting token was necessary. J√ºrgen Valentiner Brandt of Schmidt Spiele was the first publisher to make a \\"firm proposal\\" to Faidutti and Moon and they signed a contract with Schmidt Spiele in September 2004. The game was published for the N√ºrnberg fair in February 2005. Faidutti felt that the original title of the game, \\"The Temple of Doom\\",Incan Gold overview at Faidutti.com. Retrieved 2007-11-23 was much stronger but the publishers changed it to Diamant. Alan R. Moon talked with various American publishers and the U.S. edition of the game was published in late 2006 by Sunriver Games. The publishers wanted to rename it \\"The Temple of Doom\\" but went with Incan Gold because of legal issues. Faidutti noted that Incan Gold had some changes from Diamant. The rules stayed the same, but Incan Gold does not have cardboard chests or wooden pawns, and artifact cards were added to the game.

She was built in 1935. Construction and design Protector was laid down as a fast net layer by Yarrow Shipbuilders at their Scotstoun, Glasgow shipyard on 15 August 1935, launched on 20 August 1936 and was completed in December 1936. She was commissioned on 30 December 1936. Her design was based on that of , built in 1932, but with more powerful machinery and improved equipment for handling nets. Protector was long overall and between perpendiculars, with a beam of and a draught of at deep load. Displacement was standard and deep load. Two Admiralty three-drum boilers fed steam to Parsons geared steam turbines, which drove two propeller shafts. The ship's machinery was rated at , giving a speed of . The turbines were replaced in 1945 by British Thompson-Houston geared turbines. The ship was initially armed with a single QF 4-inch (102 mm) naval gun Mk V gun on a low-angle mounting aft, with this was later replaced by a twin QF 4-inch naval gun Mk XVI anti-aircraft mount, while seven 20 mm Oerlikon cannon were added to provide a close-in anti aircraft defence. The ship had a crew of 190. Modifications Protector was modified in 1955 for service as a guardship for the Falkland Islands Dependencies and a survey vessel for Antarctic waters. The twin 4-inch gun mount was moved to a forward position, allowing a flight deck and hangar for a helicopter to be fitted aft, while the close-in armament was reduced to four 20 mm cannon (with four 3-pounder saluting guns also carried). The ship's bridge was enclosed and the hull ice strengthened. A further refit in 1957 saw Protectors bridge remodelled, while in 1958 a tripod mainmast was mounted on the ship's hangar, and a crane was fitted. Service Protector was listed as part of the Mediterranean Fleet in February 1939, and remained part of the Mediterranean Fleet in August, on the eve of the outbreak of the Second World War. Protector served in the South Atlantic and in the Norwegian Campaign during World War II before being hit by an aerial torpedo in the Mediterranean. She was towed to Bombay and repaired before returning to Britain after the end of hostilities.

She made her first Antarctic patrol in the winter of 1955/56, serving the Falkland Islands and the British Antarctic Survey bases. She returned to the Antarctic 13 more times in her career. During her patrols the ship rescued the passengers and crew of the icebound MV Theron, including Sir Edmund Hillary and Dr Vivian Fuchs.

Biography Nasser Azam was born in Jhelum, Pakistan in 1963, and moved to London with his parents when he was 7 years old (1970). He began painting in 1980, and in the same year embarked on a business degree at the University of Birmingham. In 1983 he also featured in a BBC documentary. In 2007, after an extended period living and travelling in Japan, America and Europe, Azam became Artist-in- Residence at the County Hall Gallery, with an exhibition of early and recent work. Subsequent exhibitions included the 'Anatomica' series of paintings, made from illustrations taken both from fashion magazines and medical textbooks. In 2012 Azam unveiled \\"Athena\\" at Silvertown in the London Borough of Newham, London city airport. At just over twelve metres high, it is the tallest bronze sculpture in the United Kingdom. Previous sculptural work includes the large bronze sculpture The Dance, unveiled on the South Bank on 21 February 2008 and work for the National Botanic Gardens of Ireland, in Dublin. Azam's semi-abstract style of painting has been compared with that of Willem de Kooning.Stonard, Azam: A Short History of Sensation, London 2008 His paintings show the human figure encoded in bio-morphic forms and gestural marks, and typically use a restricted palette. In 2010 Azam purchased the Morris Singer Art Foundry and relaunched it as the Zahra Modern Art Foundry. 'Performance Painting' Project 2008‚Äì10 Azam preparing his canvases on an ice desert in Antarctica. Many of Azam's works during the period 2008 to 2010 were made as part of the 'performance painting' project. His purpose was to find the most extreme conditions in which to make paintings, and to use a work of art to document the moment and location in which it was made. In July 2008 Azam completed a project he called Life in Space aboard a specially modified ILYUSHIN 76 MDK parabolic aircraft, where he completed two triptychs, Homage to Francis Bacon: Triptych I and Homage to Francis Bacon: Triptych II while the aircraft created weightless conditions similar to those in space. Azam's 'Life in Space' series of paintings was exhibited in London in Spring 2009. In February 2010 Azam conducted an artistic expedition to Antarctica, where he produced 13 large abstract oil paintings responding to different Antarctic landscapes, including ice lakes, ice caves, glaciers and ice deserts. Azam prepared for the Antarctica trip with a series of artistic trials in the freezers at Billingsgate Fish Market. The expedition was accompanied by a cameraman to document the mission. Art Below In April 2011, Azam, with Art Below, carried out a dual public art display in the Tokyo Metro and London Underground commuters saw a scene of Antarctica and one artist ‚Äì a dot in the huge icy canvas. In July 2008 Azam completed two triptychs in zero gravity, done as a homage to the artist Francis Bacon. In February 2010, accompanied by a camera crew, Azam to draw inspiration from the frozen tundra of Antarctica where he endured extreme weather conditions to produce a series of large abstract oil paintings. For 2 weeks, Azam's work was on the billboard space of 2 platforms 6000 miles apart in Tokyo's Shibuya station and London's Liverpool Street Station with images of his Antarctica series. Azam commented \\"I wanted to expose the desolate, silent, spacious and empty environment of the South Pole in probably the most crowded, hectic, busy and noisy space in the world\\" Accompanying the poster display on the Liverpool Street station platform, Art Below took over a 3-metre wide digital projection screen, piloting an international video link enabling London's travellers to view the Tokyo platform ‚Äì the poster display and all the public activity going on around it. Playing on the same video loop was a 2-minute film made in collaboration with Bafta nominated British Film Director Ed Blum. Here we see Nasser Azam creating canvasses at temperatures of minus 40 degrees and buffeted by gales, he paints in different settings: on glaciers, by frozen lakes, in ice caves. Nasser says \\"I am confronted by a magnitude of blinding light, by wind and intense cold.\\" Some of his canvases were lost in an Antarctic gale. But most are here for us to see. Such ordeals need preparation. Azam prepared for this venture in the huge freezer of Billingsgate Butchers Market, devising brushes that would work in such temperatures, and acrylic paint that did not clog. Art Below made the policy decision to persist with this display in Tokyo despite tsunami, earthquake and nuclear fallout. Ben Moore said, \\"We did this in the sure conviction that Tokyo's commuters will appreciate such a diversion from their adversities. Now is not the time to withdraw our custom.\\" This was the third exhibition they have staged in the Tokyo metro.

Malala first attracted public attention through her anonymous diary published on BBC website, detailing life under Taliban occupation in Pakistan, and their attempts to ban education for girls.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england- birmingham-34957454 In 2012, Malala narrowly avoided death after being shot by the Pakistani Taliban militants for her outspoken campaigning.

After seeing Azam's monumental portrait for the first time, Malala stated: It's more than a painting to me, it's the support that Mr Azam gives to the education campaign that I stand for and that's why it means a lot to me.

Knox was responsible for moving a motion to begin each sitting day with prayers. He resigned from parliament shortly after his re- election in 1910, having suffered a stroke. Knox was also one of the seven members of the Prahran and Malvern Tramways Trust, established in 1908 to build part of Melbourne's electric tram network. The Knoxs had five sons and two daughters. When he and his wife and their younger children were visiting England in 1913, he died at Folkestone, Kent. He had declined a knighthood. His sons included: *George Hodges (1885‚Äì1960), appointed CMG in 1917, speaker of the Victorian Legislative Assembly (1942‚Äì1947) *Robert Wilson (1890‚Äì1973), businessman, knighted 1934 *William Johnstone, awarded the Military Cross and died of wounds in 1917 *MacGregor, awarded the Military Cross and permanently incapacitated References 1850 births 1913 deaths Australian businesspeople Free Trade Party members of the Parliament of Australia Members of the Australian House of Representatives for Kooyong Members of the Australian House of Representatives People educated at Scotch College, Melbourne Commonwealth Liberal Party members of the Parliament of Australia 20th-century Australian politicians ","title":"William Knox (Victorian politician)"},{"id":"14376988","text":"HMS Beagle was a Bulldog class coastal survey vessel of the Royal Navy and was the ninth to bear the name.  History  She was originally to have been called HMS Barracouta but her name was changed to HMS Beagle in honour of the ship which carried Charles Darwin. She was built by yacht builder Brooke Marine, to commercial, rather than military, ship standards at a cost of ¬£53,000,000 at 2007 prices.Hansard She was launched on 7 September 1967 by Mrs. GS Ritchie, wife of the then Hydrographer of the Navy, Rear Admiral GS Ritchie CB DSC FRICS and commissioned the following year. The class was the last Royal Navy vessels to have wooden (over steel) decks. During her Royal Naval service, BEAGLE travelled throughout the world from the Indian Ocean to the West Indies and Scotland to South Africa. Originally designed to work in pairs, since the early 1980s BEAGLE generally worked alone around the UK shores progressing the areas not covered by side-scan sonars. Following a half-life refit in 1990, Beagle was fitted with the most modern Surveying Information Processing System (SIPS) which revolutionised the way sheets were drawn and surveys conducted. BEAGLE had a ship's company of 45 Royal Naval personnel and was classed as a Warship under the White Ensign. The well- equipped galley, situated on 2 deck amidships, fed the whole ship's company to a very high standard. The Wardroom, just to starboard, the Senior Rates Mess just aft and the Junior Ratings mess forward, all having easy access. All accommodation, except the Captain's, was on 3 deck. The Junior Ratings had a 28-berth mess deck forward, the Senior Rates lived in double cabins and the Officers had a mixture of two double-berth and two single-berth cabins. All accommodation spaces were air conditioned and this coupled with good sea- keeping qualities made these ships very comfortable indeed. Specifically designed for Hydrographic Surveying, she was extensively modernised during her life with the original 28 ft survey launch being replaced with a 31 ft survey launch \\"FitzRoy\\" and the original 18 ft survey launch replaced with a Sea Rider RIB and associated davit. Designed originally to carry a SWB Land-Rover on the focsle, to be lifted on and off with the forward crane which also plumbed the forward survey hold. Of the four ships in the class, FOX was sold in 1989 FAWN in 1991 and BULLDOG in 2001. BEAGLE was affiliated with the Devon town of Newton Abbot, the Norton Fitzwarren Royal Naval Association, the 2nd Gosport Beagle Cub Pack, Ruthin School CCF & the Bulldog, Beagle & Boadicea Old Crews Association. She served in the Royal Navy until 7 February 2002 when she was paid off. She was sold in March that year for ¬£750,000 to a yacht company in Poole for conversion. In 2002 she was refitted into a four deck luxury yacht and renamed MY Titan. She is able to sleep 22 guests and accommodate 20 crew. Beginning November 2019, the vessel will be re-christened as Aqua Blu and begin voyages in Indonesia and surrounding waters.

The falls are located about east of Walcha, and 1 kilometre off the Oxley Highway in a deep gorge, that is part of the Oxley Wild Rivers National Park. They are the first falls in a succession of dramatic drops in an area that has some of the most remarkable scenery in Eastern Australia.Readers Digest Guide to Australian Places, Readers Digest, Sydney The first drop of the falls is about in depth, and the second, which is about further on, plummets to the bottom of the gorge. History The old wooden stairway, Apsley Falls, Walcha. Aboriginal people tell the story of how the Rainbow Serpent created the gorge at Apsley Falls in the Dreamtime. The Rainbow Serpent is said to travel underground from the base of the falls to reappear 20 km upstream at the Mill Hole on the Apsley River in Walcha. The site is now marked at the Mill Hole by the Rainbow Serpent mosaic made with the help of the local Aboriginal community. Apart from Aboriginal significance of the area as a meeting place, John Oxley passed by the falls on 13 September 1818 and he named them the Bathurst Falls. He described it as ‚Äúone of the most magnificent waterfalls we have seen‚Äù. Oxley named the Apsley River and wrote in his journal that he was \\"lost in astonishment at the sight of this wonderful natural sublimity\\". In 1902 three men, Ted Baker, Jim McMillan and \\"Wattie\\" Joiner built the wooden stairway that zigzagged its way from the top of the gorge to the water's edge. All timber used in this dangerous and mammoth task was hand dressed with an axe and adze by this trio. The original stairway was used until 1932, when it was declared unsafe and partly demolished.Walcha, 100 years of Local Government, Walcha Shire Council, 1989 Quite some time after parts of this stairway rotted and became dangerous, the Walcha Lions Club set about the huge task of erecting a steel staircase and viewing platform to halfway down the gorge. One of the Lions, Lindsay McMillan (son of the above Jim McMillan), designed the steel structure, lookout and platform. All materials were supplied by the Walcha Shire Council and it took the Lions Club members 1,745 hours to complete the job during 1961. The Lions were internationally, and justly, recognised for their tremendous contribution here. The official opening of the scenic stairway was on 14 October 1961 by the state member for Armidale, Davis Hughes. Features The sheer sided walls of the upper Apsley Gorge are largely caused by the slate in this area which splits vertically. The gorge rim supports a vegetation of forest and woodland with a limited understorey of shrubby plants. Common plants include a number of wattles, Acacia amoena (boomerang wattle), Acacia dealbata (silver wattle), Acacia filicifolia (fern- leaved wattle) and green wattles, plus tea trees, Eucalyptus caliginosa (broad-leaved stringy barks), Eucalyptus viminalis (ribbon gums), Eucalyptus nicholii (narrow leaved peppermint), forest red gum, Eucalyptus melliodora (yellow box), Dipodium punctatum (hyacinth orchids), Hakea fraseri (gorge hakea), Jacksonia scoparia (dogwood or native broom) and daisy bush.A View from Yallaroo Retrieved on 17 September 2008 Wedge-tailed eagles may be seen soaring on the thermals in the area. Kangaroos, crimson rosellas, echidnas also known as \\"spiny anteaters\\" and wallabies frequent the area. Facilities Since the National Parks and Wildlife Service took over they have constructed additional lookouts and walkways to view and photograph this magnificent gorge and the two falls. There are several short walks that can be taken from the car parks and these are highlighted in the information shelter erected in the area near the toilet facilities. The main falls and gorge can be easily viewed from several lookouts which are readily accessed via stairs from the car park. in addition the Oxley Walk is a 2.7 km, 1¬Ω hours walk on a sealed walkway, which crosses the river via a footbridge, then continues around the northern side of the gorge. A further lookout offers fine views of the main falls (650 m) and the track continues past another three lookouts, where one can view a second waterfall and the dramatic cliffs of the chasm. This bridge was washed away in a flood on 28 December 2009, but the replacement was opened in June 2012. Good facilities are available for caravan or tent campers, including fire wood, toilets, interpretive information, hardened walking tracks, access for disabled people, ten viewing platforms, Aboriginal history, flora and fauna. A small camping fee applies. Dogs and other domestic pets are not allowed.

It is located at 1 piazza Santissima Annunziata, in the Palazzo della Crocetta (a palace built in 1620 for princess Maria Maddalena de' Medici, daughter of Ferdinand I de Medici, by Giulio Parigi). History The museum was inaugurated in the presence of king Victor Emmanuel II in 1870 in the buildings of the Cenacolo di Fuligno on via Faenza. At that time it only comprised Etruscan and Roman remains. As the collections grew, a new site soon became necessary and in 1880 the museum was transferred to its present building. The collection's first foundations were the family collections of the Medici and Lorraine, with several transfers from the Uffizi up to 1890 (except the collections of marble sculpture which the Uffizi already possessed). The Egyptian section was first formed in the first half of the 18th century from part of the collections of Pierre L√©opold de Toscane, from another part of an expedition promoted by the same Grand Duke in 1828‚Äì29 and led by Ippolito Rosellini and Champollion (the man who first deciphered hieroglyphics). In 1887 a new topographic museum on the Etruscans was added, but it was destroyed in the 1966 floods. Etruscan collections Chimera of Arezzo The organisation of the Etruscan rooms was reconsidered and reordered in 2006. Also in 2006, the 40-year-overdue restoration was carried out on over 2000 objects damaged in the 1966 floods. * The Chimera of Arezzo ‚Äì discovered in 1553 at Arezzo during the construction of a Medici fortress * The statue of the Arringatore (\\"The Orator\\"), a life- size bronze sculpture of an Etruscan man wearing a toga (1st century BC) * The funerary statue Mater Matuta (460‚Äì450 BC) (returned to Chianciano Terme) * The sarcophagus of Laerthia Seianti (2nd century BC) * The sarcophagus of the Amazons (4th century BC) Roman collections * The \\"idolino of Pesaro\\", a 146-cm-high bronze statue of a young man, a Roman copy from a classical Greek original, found in fragments in the centre of Pesaro in October 1530. * The \\"torso di Livorno\\", copy of a 5th-century BC Greek original. * Statue of a cockerel, the so-called \\"Gallo Treboniano\\", late 3rd-century work. * The Minerva of Arezzo, a bronze Roman copy of a 4th-century BC Greek model attributed to Praxiteles. Greek collections The huge collection of ancient ceramics is shown in a large room with numerous cases on the second floor. Generally the vases come from Etruscan tombs and are evidence of cultural and mercantile exchange with Greece, and particularly Athens (where most of the vases were made) and date to the period between the 4th century BC and the present. The most important of the vases is a large black figure krater of c. 570 BC signed by the potter Ergotimos and the painter Kleitias. It is named the \\"Fran√ßois vase\\" after the archaeologist who found it in 1844 in an Etruscan tomb at fonte Rotella, on the Chiusi road, and shows a series of Greek mythological narratives on both sides. Other notable objects are: * the red figure hydria signed by the Meidias painter (550‚Äì540 BC) * the cups by the Little Masters (560‚Äì540 BC), named after their miniaturist style of their figures * the sculptures of Apollo and Apollino Milani (6th century BC, named after the man who gave them to the museum) * the athlete's torso (5th century BC) * the large Hellenistic horse's head (known as the Medici Riccardi head after the first place it was displayed, in the Medici's Riccardi palace), fragment of an equestrian statue, which inspired Donatello and Verrocchio in two famous equestrian monuments in Padua and Venice. * two Archaic marble kouroi, displayed in a corridor Image:Kleitias e vasaio ergotimos, cratere fran√ßois, 570 ac ca. 02.JPGThe \\"Vase Francois\\" Image:Museo archeologico di Firenze, Apollino Milani 520-510 a.c..JPGThe \\"Apollino Milani\\" Image:Museo archeologico di Firenze, Museo Egizio, sala (2).JPGthumbGallery in the Egyptian collection Egyptian Museum The Egyptian section of the collection is known as the Egyptian Museum, and is the second largest collection of Egyptian artifacts in Italy, after that of the Museo Egizio in Turin. Foundation Florence's first collection of Egyptian antiquities was in the Medici collection, dating from the eighteenth century. In the nineteenth century, Leopold II, Grand Duke of Tuscany, began acquisition of the artifacts now housed at the Egyptian Museum. Together with Charles X of France, he financed a scientific expedition to Egypt in 1828 to 1829. The expedition was directed by Jean-Fran√ßois Champollion, who deciphered the hieroglyphic script. Ippolito Rosellini, friend and student of Champollion, represented the Italian interests during the expedition. He went on to become the father of Italian Egyptology. Many artifacts were collected during the expedition, both from archeological diggings, and via purchases from local merchants. On their return, these were distributed evenly between the Louvre in Paris, and the new Egyptian Museum in Florence. Development The museum was officially opened in 1855. The first director was Ernesto Schiaparelli, from Piedmont. He later went on to become director of the larger Egyptian museum in Turin. By 1880 he had catalogued the collection and organized transportation of the antiquities to the Florentine Archaeological Museum. Under Schiaparelli, the collection expanded with further excavations and purchases carried out in Egypt. Many of the artifacts were, however, later transferred to Turin. The Florentine collection continued to grow after this time, with donations from private individuals and scientific institutions. In particular, the Papyrological Institute of Florence provided artifacts from its expeditions to Egypt between 1934 and 1939. These now provide one of the most substantial collections of Coptic art and documents in the world. The Egyptian Museum today The museum now has a permanent staff including two professional Egyptologists. It houses more than 14,000 artifacts, distributed in nine galleries and two warehouses. The artifacts displayed in the galleries have been substantially restored. The old classification system devised by Schiaparelli is being replaced by a new, chronological and partly topographical system. The collection comprises material that extends from the prehistorical era right through to the Coptic Age. There are remarkable collections of stele, mummies, ushabti, amulets and bronze statuettes of several eras. There are statues from the reign of Amenhotep III, a chariot from the eighteenth dynasty,W.

The resulting wine is left with a high level of residual sugar because most strains of yeast cannot reproduce at such a high alcohol level. Vins de liqueur are available in many regional styles and varieties of grape. Grapes from the Champagne region are used for the production of ratafia. The Rh√¥ne region makes a wine known as rinquinquin, and the Languedoc region produces a local vin de liqueur that is called cartag√®ne.

P. aristata has become one of South Africa's most famous proteas in spite of its relatively late discovery, and re-discovery in 1953. The leaves are soft, dense and needle-like and the flower heads are a stunning crimson red, it may thus be a good potential ornamental plant for South African gardens. It is usually called the Ladismith sugarbush in South African English, although it has been called pine sugar bush in Australia. In the Afrikaans language it has the vernacular name of klein-den-suikerbos. Taxonomy A specimen of Protea aristata was first collected by the South African botanists Thomas Pearson Stokoe and Richard Primos as a budding branch in the 'Seven Weeks Poort Mountains', near the town of Ladismith in the Western Cape province of South Africa. Based on the holotype specimen collected by these two, the South African Protea taxonomist Edwin Percy Phillips described the plant as a new species in 1938. In spite of being locally common in the Seweweekspoort (a mountain pass) the plant species could not be found again until 1953, prior to which it was considered to be extinct. When exactly the species was first collected is in dispute, the label on the herbarium voucher sheet (Primos#85) housed in the Kew Herbarium, written by Primos, states December 1937, but in the species description written by Phillips in the Journal of South African Botany the date December 1928 is given. The Kew specimen is labelled as being a 'type', perhaps it is the holotype, but it may also be an isotype, because the National Herbarium in Pretoria also has a sheet with the collection number Primos#85, this sheet having more exsiccata material attached to it. This sheet is labelled, also by Primos, as being collected at the exact same locality, but on December 1928, and confusingly, it is stored as the holotype of the species P. laetans, which was first collected from along the Blyde River in Mpumalanga. The Latin word aristata means 'awned' and refers to the prominent awns on the lip found atop the perianth. Description Habitus This species is an upright, stocky, perennial, evergreen shrub from up to in height, up to in diameter in very old specimens, with a single main stem up to in diameter. For the plants in cultivation in Australia, common sizes of the adult shrubs are given as between and , but most garden shrubs usually attain the height of , and a spread of . It is somewhat like a small pine tree in appearance. The bark of the trunk is smooth and grey- coloured, but the younger stems have light brown bark. In the wild, the shrubs were originally found growing trailing upon the ground. The flower-bearing stems are upright, hairless, 5 - 7mm in diameter, and carry the flower at the apex. The plants are very slow to mature, and may live to 50 years. The leaves and stems of this species exude an unpleasant, sulphuric smell when cut or bruised. Leaves The leaves are thin and needle-like, linear, flattened, smooth in texture and arranged pointing upwards on the stem. They are in length, 2 - 3mm in width, and terminate in a soft black acuminate point. They are glabrous and glaucous-green in colour. The petiolar region only tapers slightly into the leaf blade. Flowers Protea aristata apical inflorescences. The flower heads are large for a Protea species, and shaped like an inverted cone (obconic), to bell-shaped when fully opened. It is in length and wide. The involucral bracts are arranged in 7 to 9 series, with the outer series very broad and egg-shaped to almost rounded, nude, 10 - 15mm long, 10mm wide. Inner series long and quite broad, acuminate, 40 - 80mm in length, 20 - 25mm in width, densely hairy; innermost series spatulate, 100 - 120mm in length, 10 - 15mm in width, terminally hooked. The bracts vary in colour from dark to almost black at the base in the outer series, to a deep carmine or crimson in the inner series; the dense hairs give a silvery appearance to the bracts, which are tipped with short white hairs along the margins at the apex. The colour has also been described as reddish pink, and that of the outer bracts dark red, with the inner being pink. It is monoecious, both sexes occur in each flower. The perianth of the flower is coloured pink. The fruit grow quickly. Distribution Protea aristata is restricted in the wild to the northern and southern slopes in a 60 km stretch of the far western end of the Klein Swartberg mountains in the Western Cape province of South Africa. The total extent of occurrence is 423 km¬≤, the area of occupancy within that where the plants actually grow is only 152 km¬≤. This region stretches from the Buffelspoort to the Seweweekspoort. It is known from less than ten different populations found within this range. It can be seen in the wild in the mountains above the town of Ladismith, where it has been recorded growing along certain roadsides, and near the town of Calitzdorp. The plant seldom clusters into dense communities, rather it is found as single plants widely distributed throughout the landscape. Ecology Habitat Protea aristata seems to prefer rocky krantzes, ledges on high-altitude cliffs and open, rocky sandstone slopes, the habit of which has, according to the South African botanist John Patrick Rourke, led to the survival of very old specimens possibly of up to fifty years old, protected from fire by their rocky surroundings. The habitat is otherwise montane fynbos. In all of the known locations where it is found in the wild it grows in a substrate derived from sandstone. It is found growing between the altitudes of 600 to 1,500 metres, or up to 1,585 metres, although an early, when it was much less known, 1959 botanical magazine profile on the species stated 750 to 2,000 metres. Wildfires should ideally pass through the territory every fifteen years. Reproduction Cape Sugarbird (Promerops cafer), the probable main pollinator, on a different species of Protea in Slanghoek Mountain Resort, Western Cape. Flowering occurs in the hot and dry summer, from October to December, with the peak in December, and occasionally as late as February. Sometimes the flowering can commense as early as spring. It is pollinated by birds, possibly especially the Cape sugarbird. The seed is fully ripe by May in the wild. When released from their capsules, the seeds are eventually dispersed by means of the wind. Wildfires The adult specimens of this protea are killed when they are caught in the wildfires which periodically pass through the native habitat, but the seeds can survive such events. Protea species which have adapted to frequent fire regimes in their habitat in such a manner are called 'reseeders', or, more technically, serotinous. The fruit are stored in the old, dried inflorescences, which are persistently retained on the plant after senescence, although they eventually fall off. According to Rourke, drought-stricken plants in their natural habitat shed their seeds much faster than those growing in cultivation. In the wild this normally occurs after six to nine months, but in cultivation they may remain closed on the plant for a year or more. According to one source the seeds are not kept protected within the seed head, but are released immediately after ripening. Other sources dispute this, stating that the inflorescence only opens to allow the seeds to escape after it has completely dessicated. Fires in late summer may stimulate the inflorescences to open. Uses The sole limiting feature of the plant as an ornamental cut flower is the unpleasant odour emitted by the cut stems. Nonetheless it said to work well as a cut flower, and is grown on commercial flower farms in Hawaii and California. The cultivar Protea √ó 'Venus' is a scentless hybrid of P. aristata with P. repens and is grown in the cut flower industry. Soon after its re-discovery, it was featured in the South African botanical magazine Flowering Plants of Africa in 1959, illustrated with a painting by the botanical artist Fay Anderson. It was featured on the South African 10 cent postage stamp in 1977. Horticulture Protea aristata only became known to the general South African public as an ornamental plant in the 1960s. The plants grow slowly and are long-lived compared to other species of garden Protea, and make a neat, compact shrub, whereas most other species become scraggly with age. Pruning off the old flower heads after flowering helps maintain the compact shape. In cultivation it will grow in clay, loam or sandy soils, with a pH range from acidic to alkaline, but it performs best in well-drained, acidic, sandstone- derived soils, and will also grow well in a well-draining granitic medium. It prefers a position in full sunlight. The species is fairly resistant to drought, especially once established, and frost down to -4¬∞C. It will not grow well in areas with too much moisture or rainfall. The plant attracts birds and insects. It can be used in Mediterranean-style gardens, a fynbos garden or a larger rock garden, as a container specimen, a feature plant, or as part of a mixed bed. There are some magnificent specimens in the National Botanical Gardens at Kirstenbosch, Cape Town, although it is grown there with some difficulty because it is sometimes too wet at this location. It has also been recommended as a good garden plant on the plains and near the coast in South Australia. It is best propagated using fresh seed. Seed is best sown in the late summer to autumn. Seeds and seedlings rot easily when afforded excessive amounts of water, thus the substrate must be well-aerated and well-drained. Seeds germinate best when they are only slightly covered with the substrate. As an adaption to the periodic wildfires in their habitat, seeds likely germinate more successfully after being treated with smoke, using a tent, or a liquid smoke extract. Seeds also appear to be stimulated to germinate by alternating cool nights with warm days, between 10¬∞C and 20¬∞C. The seedlings are best grown out under light shade, such as in a shade-house in South Africa. Like all species of Protea, in cultivation the plants are susceptible to a large variety of pests and diseases. In South Africa, possible pests include caterpillars, nematodes, scale insects, tipwilters and snout beetles. Root rot caused by Phytophthora cinnamomi is the most dangerous lethal disease of proteas, especially during the warmth of summer, but a variety of fungi pathogens can kill proteas. Conservation In his 1980 book on the proteas of Southern Africa Rourke stated that although Protea aristata was said to be generally considered scarce in the wild, it was in fact be quite common within its distribution. By the 1990s it was officially considered a rare plant. In 1996 the South African National Biodiversity Institute first assessed the conservation status of the species for the Red List of South African Plants as 'rare', this was upgraded to 'vulnerable' in 2009, an assessment that was repeated in 2019. In 2009 the total population was estimated to have a maximum of 6,000 individuals, with no one subpopulation numbering more than 1,000 plants. Many of the less than ten localities where this species is known to occur are small and only consist of some isolated plants. The total population numbers are believed to be decreasing as of 2019. Nonetheless, the species is still said to be locally common in the Seweweekspoort mountain pass. Too frequent fires are a problem for this plant, as they do not allow the plants enough time to mature, and the recruitment of new seedlings is diminished. This is thought to be the main reason for the decline of the species.

The group consists of singer/keyboardist/bassist/guitarist Jesika von Rabbit, guitarist/bassist/programmer/singer Todd Rutherford, drummer Jason Gilbert and guitarist/producer Ethan Allen. Their musical style has been described as an amalgamation of psychedelic rock and electropop. Their fanbase is sometimes referred to as a self-styled \\"cult\\" called The Royal Order of Rabbits. History 1970's-1999: Jesika von Rabbit Jesika von Rabbit (birth name Jessica Leischow) grew up in Green Bay, Wisconsin. She started learning the piano at 6 years old. Her mother was a singer in a hotel lounge band which mostly covered '80s pop songs by artists like Madonna, Pat Benatar and Joan Jett. The Von Rabbit name came from her appreciation of Jefferson Airplane song White Rabbit. Von Rabbit moved to Minneapolis when she was 18 where she started a band called the Porn Flakes, and she was also in a band called the Minx and after five years she eventually moved to Los Angeles in about 1996 to seek music collaborators of a like mind as herself. 1970's-1999: Todd Rutherford Rutherford (birth name Todd Rutherford Johnson) grew up in Porterville, California, where he developed his skills on piano and guitar. His father was a professional jazz pianist. Rutherford moved to San Francisco to continue his musical dreams. 2000-2003: Formation of Gram Rabbit Von Rabbit and Rutherford first met in the summer of 2000 when invited to Joshua Tree by a mutual friend to start a band. The two musicians did not find the band proceedings to work for them, and each night they went to their rooms to work on their own material. While the two were in the legendary Room 8 of the Joshua Tree Inn (site of Gram Parsons death), Von Rabbit and Rutherford decided to work together and perform at Gram Fest, an annual festival honoring Gram Parsons at Joshua Tree in October. They intended to perform a set consisting exclusively of Gram Parsons covers, and named their side project Gram Rabbit as a combination of a nod to Gram Parsons and referencing Jesika von Rabbit's nom de plume. Although they failed to qualify for the festival due to their application being too late, they found that the worked well together. Rutherford played a demo he was working on, which eventually evolved into \\"Cowboys & Aliens\\", and they realized that their sounds worked well, a cosmic connection between the two. The two immediately quit that band that had brought them to Joshua Tree in order to pursue Gram Rabbit full-time. The two were too broke to buy instruments needed for a band, so they headed back to Rutherford's hometown to live in a trailer across the street from Rutherford's grandparents horse and cattle ranch while working on new material until they returned to Joshua Tree two years later with a collection of new songs and a vision for the group's sound, philosophy and look. During this time, they were joined by bass player Travis Cline, a high-school friend of Rutherfords. The original band when complete consisted of singer/keyboardist/guitarist Jesika von Rabbit, guitarist/singer Todd Rutherford and bassist/sampler Travis Cline and moved back to Joshua Tree ready to play in 2003, playing shows in Silverlake and elsewhere under the name of the Gram Rabbit Experience. After performing various shows in Los Angeles and San Francisco, a band that they opened for, Singapore Sling, liked them enough to recommend them to their record label, Stinky Records. The label producers listened to them the next show, and signed Gram Rabbit. Gram Rabbit's shows frequently use desert scenes, and their songs and shows often use rabbit themes, helping to develop a fan-base that call themselves \\"The Royal Order of the Rabbits.\\" The band sold rabbit ears and tossed some off the stage, so that fans could wear them. They even have fans who dress in full bunny costumes. 2004: Music to Start a Cult To Music to Start a Cult To was recorded over a three-week period in the spring of 2004 with producer Ethan Allen, in Los Angeles. The album was released in August on the Stinky Records label. The title for the album came from a friend of Von Rabbit's in Minneapolis, Chrissy Kesselring, who was a graphic designer. Kesselring had to design a CD for a class she was taking, and the designed CD appealed to Gram Rabbit. The idea of a cults and culty stuff felt right because of the band's rabbit ears and desert location. The band had their CD release party at Pappy & Harriet's, and were joined by a new band member, rhythm guitarist Tracy Lyons-Tarr, who used to play with Von Rabbit back in a band in Minneapolis and had contributed guitar work on \\"Land of Jail\\" on the album. BMI, one of the major music rights organization, selected Gram Rabbit and their new album for their Pick of the Month program which showcases new artists. Per Tony George of BMI, \\"We try to present bands that have commercial appeal but are also on the cutting edge of what's going on. The thing about Gram Rabbit is that it's almost uncategorizable. It's so different and unique and special that people here thought we should give them a shot.... It's such a weird confluence of styles.\\" 2005‚Äì2006: Cultivation Gram Rabbit were hailed as best new L.A. Band in 2005 at the LA Weekly Music Awards. The momentum built during the release earned the band a Main Stage slot at 2005's Coachella Music and Arts Festival. Lyons-Tarr was replaced by Rutherford's brother Eric Jonasson before the recording of Cultivation, which was recorded in the fall of 2005, in Joshua Tree and in the Silverlake, California studio of producer Ethan Allen. Rutherford helped co- produce the album. Like the first album, the release party was held at Pappy & Harriets. The album mixed in many different styles, from shoegaze bliss to post-Kashmir grunge. 2007‚Äì2013: Independent releases When Gram Rabbit decided to write their third album, they decided to make it more of a party record, with a return to their electronic roots. Just before RadioAngel & the RobotBeat was to come out, Stinky Records closed shop. Gram Rabbit at that time decided to call it quits with their management, and rather than find new management and a new label, decided to release their album themselves, creating their own independent label Royal Order. By the time they recorded RadioAngel and the RobotBeat and released it in 2007, the band was pared down to just Von Rabbit and Rutherford. The independent period of seven years brought three more full lengths from the band and three EP's. They released the socially political-themed electro-rock RadioAngel & the RobotBeat in 2007, the epic spiritually driven Miracles & Metaphors in 2010, and the throwback spaced-out country styling's of 2012's Welcome to the Country. The album was intended for a side project band formed by Jesika von Rabbit and Todd Rutherford, called The Country, in order to explore different sounds, but was released as Gram Rabbit because their sound is all over the map anyway. The song \\"Desperate Heart\\" was originally going to open Welcome to the Country, but it was licensed instead to Fruit of the Loom. Their EPs during this time period include a previously unreleased collection of the band's earliest home recordings entitled Rare Bits in 2008, The Desert Sound E.P. in 2010, and Braised & Confused in 2013. To date their records have produced more than 30 licenses in television series, national commercial campaigns, and films, with more than 20 different tracks used in these spots. NBC, CBS, ABC, FOX, The CW, FX, Bravo, STARZ, and MTV have all used the band's music in hit shows like CSI, Life, The Real World, Sons of Anarchy, Crash, and 10 Things I Hate About You. Kyocera and Fruit of the Loom have used the music to promote their products in national television campaigns. Motion pictures such as Crazy, Stupid, Love (Steve Carell, Emma Stone), War, Inc. (John Cusack), and Interview (Steve Buscemi), have included the cinematic sounds of Gram Rabbit in their films. 2013-present: Band hiatus and solo work After 12 years together, Von Rabbit and Rutherford decided to take a break from each other, to try to live life and experience music on their own. Although on hiatus, the band still comes together for their Halloween shows at Pappy & Harriet's Pioneertown Palace. Von Rabbit has stated that Gram Rabbit has never officially broken up. =Jesika von Rabbit= Von Rabbit continued to tour by herself and her backing band, and has toured with other bands, such as Eagles of Death Metal.

It enters the Chikankata District of Southern Province and reaches a junction with the T1 Road by the Kafue Weighbridge. As the T2 continues to the Chirundu border with Zimbabwe (which connects to Harare), the Lusaka-Livingstone Road is no-longer the T2 Road and continues from this junction as the T1 Road westwards, becoming the main route through the Southern Province. T1 Road From the T2 Road t-junction, the T1 goes westwards for to the town of Mazabuka. It enters Mazabuka in a northerly direction. By ABSA Bank, the T1 turns westwards and by Mazabuka Police Station, the T1 turns northwards. It is one road for the remainder of its length to Livingstone. North of Mazabuka town centre, the road turns west and then south west. It goes for , through the settlement of Magoye, to the town of Monze. After passing through Monze in a southerly direction, it continues for , through the small town of Chisekesi (where it meets a road going to Gwembe), to the town of Pemba. From Pemba, the T1 goes south-west for , through the settlement of Batoka, to the city of Choma, Southern Province's Capital since 2012. In Choma, the T1 meets the M11 Road, which connects Choma with Namwala and the Itezhi-Tezhi Dam. It also meets a road (D356) connecting southwards to Sinazongwe by Lake Kariba. From Choma, the T1 goes west-south- west for to the town of Kalomo, which was the first capital city of the former North-Western Rhodesia. In Kalomo, the T1 meets a road which accesses the southern part of the Kafue National Park. From Kalomo, the road goes south- west for to the market town of Zimba. From Zimba, the road continues south- south-west for , through a narrow part of Kazungula District, to the city of Livingstone, Zambia's tourist capital. South of Livingstone City Centre, the T1 Road meets the M10 Road, which connects Livingstone with Kazungula (Botswana Border Post), Sesheke (Namibia Border Post) and Mongu. This marks the end of the Lusaka-Livingstone Road. The T1 continues southwards for another to the Victoria Falls, where it crosses the Zambezi River via the Victoria Falls Bridge into the Republic of Zimbabwe, where it becomes the A8 Road to Bulawayo. The town on the other side of the Zambezi River crossing is also named Victoria Falls.

History The Franciscans order arrived in Bosnia in the later half of the 13th century, aiming to eradicate the teachings of the Bosnian Church. The first Franciscan vicariate in Bosnia was founded in 1339/40. The province itself is the only institution in Bosnia and Herzegovina which has operated uninterruptedly since the Middle Ages. The Franciscan order was allowed by Sultan Mehmed II the Conqueror in the Ottoman Empire in 1463, after the Ottoman conquest of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Friar Anƒëeo Zvizdoviƒá of the Monastery in Fojnica received the oath on May 28 of 1463 at the camp of Milodra≈æ. The Ahdname of Milodra≈æ stated: The original edict is still kept in the Franciscan monastery in Fojnica. It is one of the oldest surviving documents on religious freedom. In 1971, the United Nations published a translation of the document in all the official U.N. languages. The ferman was republished by the Ministry of Culture of Turkey for the 700th anniversary of the foundation of the Ottoman State. Without a regular hierarchy of bishops in place, the diocesan clergy fell into decline and disappeared by the mid-19th century. To support the local church which was functioning without resident bishops, the Holy See founded an Apostolic Vicariate for Bosnia in 1735, and assigned Franciscans as apostolic vicars to direct it. The Franciscan Province of Bosna Srebrena was restructured to correspond to the borders of Ottoman rule in 1757; it split in 1846, when friars from the Kresevo monastery broke off to found the monastery at Siroki Brijeg. A separate Franciscan jurisdiction (a \\"custody\\") was established for Herzegovina in 1852. Pope Leo XIII raised it to the status of a province (the Province of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary) in 1892.

History The Peugeot 201 was presented at the 1929 Paris Motor Show with the backdrop of the Wall Street Crash. While many European manufacturers did not survive the ensuing depression, the 201's image as an inexpensive car helped Peugeot to survive the economic crisis with its finances intact and its status as a major auto producer confirmed. Models During the 1930s Peugeot offered several variants of the 201, with increasing engine capacity. Initially, it was powered by a 1122 cc engine developing at 3500 rpm (top speed: 80 km/h / 50 mph). This was followed by an engine of 1307 cc, and finally a 1465 cc unit of . The Peugeot 201C, launched in 1931, is claimed to be the first mass-produced car equipped with independent front suspension, a concept rapidly adopted by the competition. The simpler beam front axle version remained available, but the independent suspension system reportedly improved road holding and reduced steering column vibration. Naming In the early twentieth century, car manufacturers paid little attention to the naming of their vehicles. The 201's predecessor, the Type 190, is so named because it was the 190th distinct design developed by Peugeot. However, at the time few customers would have been aware of the name \\"Type 190\\". Even in the company's own brochures, the car now known as the Type 190 was simply called \\"La 5CV Peugeot\\" (The Peugeot 5 hp). For Peugeot, a new naming scheme was introduced when the Type 190 was replaced by Peugeot 201.Mus√©e de l'Aventure Peugeot. The exhibit label (2012) states: ¬´ Jusqu'√† pr√©sente le mod√®les Peugeot se suivaient dans une num√©rotation plus ou moins logique qui d'ailleurs n'√©tait que peu utilise par la publicit√©. Par exemple le 190 S √©tait pr√©sent√© dans les brochures sous le nom ¬´ Le 5 CV Peugeot ¬ª. Avec la 201 une √®re novelle commence.¬ª The 201 was the first Peugeot to carry a name comprising three numerals with a central zero, a naming scheme continued with the 301 and 401. Peugeot took effective steps to protect all such automobile names, to the discomfiture of Porsche in the 1960s as they prepared to launch their new 901 model. Curiously, the name of the Ferrari 308 was not a problem. Light commercials Between 1931 and 1933 the company produced 1,676 commercial versions of the 201, aimed at small shopkeepers and other businessmen. A wide range of body types was produced including a flatbed truck, a \\"bakers' van\\" and light vans with and without side windows behind the B-pillar. During the early 1930s panel van and light truck versions of the Peugeot 201 were also produced.

The original 301 can be seen either as a belated replacement for the Type 177, which had not been on sale since 1928, or as a return by Peugeot to that market segment after having left it for four years. It was replaced in 1936 by the Peugeot 302. The body Peugeot 301 saloon The 301C saloon produced in 1932 and 1933 featured a six-light (three windows on each side with a rear quarter window) four-door boxy body, with space at the back for a separate boot. Slightly longer-bodied versions without the separate luggage box were also available. The 301 CR introduced to the Sochaux lines after the summer break of 1933 was less angular, and the word \\"a√©rodynamique\\" featured prominently in Peugeot's publicity for the restyled car. Another, bolder change to the look of the saloon came with the introduction of the 301D in 1934. The 301D was no longer a six-light saloon, and it featured a longer sloping tail which suggested the streamlining of the Peugeot 402 and 302 which would appear during the following two years. A variety of four-door 301s constructed on the same chassis were produced, although a longer wheelbase was also available for use, among other applications, as a taxicab with a middle set of seats that could be folded away (\\"strapontins\\"). There were also various 2-door versions which could be bodied as coup√©s or cabriolets. A commercial version, the 301T, had a tall van body replacing the usual passenger cabin section directly behind the B pillar. Vintage Peugeot 301 at the History on Wheels Museum, Eton WIck, Windsor, UK The engine Despite the changes in body design over the lifetime of the Peugeot 301, the configuration of the engine remained the same: a four- cylinder water-cooled unit of 1465 cc. A maximum output of at 4000 rpm was stated for the 301D, with passenger car maximum speeds of between 80 km/h (50 mph) and 100 km/h (62 mph) according to body type. For the much taller 301 van the maximum speed did not exceed 70 km/h (44 mph). An electric starter motor was included, although, as was normal at the time, provision for manual cranking remained. Technical The 301 was based on the underpinnings of the commercially more successful Peugeot 201, originally introduced in 1929. The rear wheels were driven via a three-speed manual transmission. There was no synchromesh. The drum brakes were cable operated. The lights, controlled from a knob in the middle of the steering column, operated on a twelve-volt electrical system. Innovative suspension The 301 was fitted with independent front suspension: it was one of the first volume produced cars to be thus equipped from launch, and benefited from exceptionally good road holding as well as greatly reduced vibration from the steering column by the standards of the time. Leaf springs at the rear were in line with contemporary practice. Commercial The 301 competed in the class in terms of fiscal horsepower, and sold approximately 70,000 units during its four-year model run.

It is most commonly done by thru-hikers, as they pass by on the Appalachian Trail. It is a twenty- to thirty-year-old tradition, in which, as the train passes the trail, many hikers choose to drop their drawers and moon the passengers. There are several theories as to the reasons for this tradition. One holds that it is an act of protest against the smoke, steam, and noise pollution generated by the railroad, which is known as the \\"Smog Railway\\" to some hikers.

An off-duty New Hampshire State Trooper and a Forest Ranger began riding the train and arresting hikers who mooned it.

Background The 302 was effectively a shortened version of the Peugeot 402 with a smaller engine. It was launched a year after the 402. Positioning the 302 The aerodynamic 402 was enthusiastically received by the market, but it was half a class larger than the Citro√´n Traction Avant which had in many ways rewritten the rule book when launched in 1934, and which during the later 1930s acquired a range of different engine sizes and wheelbase lengths. The 302 could compete more directly with the Citro√´n as a modest return to stability after the economic crisis of 1929 hinted at future growth in market demand for mid-sized saloons. Nevertheless, by the time the car was actually launched the country was in a state of industrial turmoil and heightened political uncertainty. A short life Peugeot had ended production of their popular 201 model in September 1937, and its replacement, the smaller Peugeot 202 would appear only in February 1938. At the time of Motor Show in October 1937 the Peugeot 302 was still listed, partly in order to help clear remaining stocks after what had been a precarious year for French industry, both economically and politically, but the car itself was absent from the Peugeot show-stand. Through the autumn and winter of 1937/38 the 302 was the smallest and least expensive car on offer at Peugeot dealers. The body Peugeot 302 front grille with hole for starter handle passing through the 302 The 302 faithfully followed the style of the longer 402, complete with a sloping front grill behind which lurked the head lights. An eye catching detail was the hole for the starter handle on lower part of the front grill, which passed through the middle digit of the vertically inscribed name \\"302\\", coloured in patriotic blue, white and red. In addition to the saloon and the manufacturer's own two-door four-seater cabriolet, a small number of special bodied versions were produced including a Darl'mat built 302 roadster and a cabriolet incorporating the automatic fold-away steel roof design patented by Georges Paulin back in 1931. Engine and running gear The four cylinder water cooled 1758 cc engine was in most respects similar to the slightly larger engine fitted to the 402. Tax horsepower was 10 CV, rather than the 11 CV of the 402. Maximum actual output of was claimed, along with a maximum speed of . Power was delivered from the front-mounted engine to the rear wheels via a traditional three-speed gear box. A couple of years earlier, Peugeot had scored a first among the volume automakers when they introduced an upgraded 201 featuring independent front suspension, and with competitors such as Renault reluctant to invest in keeping up on the technical front, and subsequent Peugeot models such as the 302 featuring independent front suspension, Peugeot were able to win plaudits for a technical advance which provided for superior road holding and comfort, especially when the car was driven briskly on poor roads. At the back the 302 used a rigid axle suspended using cantilever-spring combinations.

Career Hailey was Governor of the Punjab from 1924 to 1928, a compromiser with the Akali leadership, and Governor of the United Provinces 1928 to 1934. He was early convinced of the strength of Indian nationalism, but remained ambivalent about it.Thomas R. Metcalf, Ideologies of the Raj (1994) , p. 227. He was appointed a CIE in 1911, a Companion of the Order of the Star of India in 1915, a Knight Commander of the Order of the Indian Empire 1921 and appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Indian Empire in 1928 and a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Star of India in 1932. In 1936, while he was the Governor of United Provinces, India's oldest national park was created and was named Hailey National Park in his honour (later renamed Jim Corbett National Park). The same year, he was raised to the peerage as Baron Hailey, of Shahpur in the Punjab and Newport Pagnell in the County of Buckingham. In 1937 he was elected President of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland. In 1939 he was made a GCMG. He subsequently spent time on missions to Africa, producing the African Survey in the late 1930s that proved very influential.Robert D. Pearce, The Turning Point in Africa: British Colonial Policy, 1938-48 (1982), p. 43. He advised limited recognition of African national movements.Barbara Bush, Imperialism, Race and Resistance: Africa and Britain, 1919-1945 (1999), p. 263. He was invited to a meeting by the Secretary of State for the Colonies, Malcolm MacDonald, in 1939 at which the setting up of the Colonial Social Science Research Council was discussed. In 1942 he was appointed to lead the British Colonial Research Committee. In 1948, he was made a member of the Privy Council. His powers of speaking and intellectual synthesis were widely recognised.Robin W. Winks, Alaine M. Low, The Oxford History of the British Empire (1999), p. 31. He became a member of the Order of Merit in 1956. Hailey also served as a Trustee of The Rhodes Trust from 1941-1964. Personal life Malcolm Hailey married Andreina Alesandra Balzani in 1896. Lord Hailey died at Putney on 1st June 1969 and his ashes were taken for burial in the family vault at Simla in India. With his death, the barony became extinct, as his only son and heir, Alan Hailey (1900‚Äì1943) had been killed without issue in the Middle East during the Second World War.

This low volume special model was in most respects a Peugeot 202, but it had a lengthened nose which accommodated the larger engine of the 402. And it was branded not as a 202 but as a special variation of Peugeot 402. The Peugeot 402 is a large family car produced in Sochaux, France from 1935 to 1942 by Peugeot. It was unveiled at the Paris Motor Show in 1935, replacing the Peugeot 401. Peugeot 402 Eclipse d√©capotable (1938) The Peugeot 403, introduced approximately thirteen years after the demise of the 402, can be seen as the older car's natural heir. (Immediately after World War II the market demanded smaller cars: Peugeot acknowledged this by concentrating during the late 1940s and early 1950s on their 202 and 203 models.) A conservative innovator The 402 was characterized by what became during the 1930s a \\"typically Peugeot\\" front end, with headlights well set back behind the grille. The style of the body was reminiscent of the Chrysler Airflow, and received in France the soubriquet Fuseau Sochaux which loosely translates as \\"Sochaux spindle\\". Streamlining was a feature of French car design in the 1930s, as can be seen by comparing the Citro√´n Traction Avant or some of the Bugatti models of the period with predecessor models: Peugeot was among the first volume manufacturers to apply streamlining to the extent exemplified by the 402 and smaller Peugeot 202 in a volume market vehicle range. Recessed ‚Äòsafety‚Äô door handles also highlighted the car's innovative aspirations, as did the advertised automatic transmission and diesel engine options. Comparisons with Citro√´n's large family car of the time were and remain unavoidable. In that comparison, the basic underpinnings of the 402 remained conventional, based on known technologies, and presumably were relatively inexpensive to develop and manufacture: it was Citro√´n that in 1934 had been forced to sell its car manufacturing business to its largest creditor. Sticking to a traditional separate chassis configuration also made it much easier for Peugeot's 402 to be offered with a wide range of different bodies. The amount invested in developing the car and in tooling up to produce it, as well as the way in which it was priced, suggest that Peugeot always intended the 402 to be, by the standards of the time, a big seller. Nevertheless, it was also a big car, at the high end of the volume car market, and in advertising material of the time Peugeot evidently thought it important to highlight one or two tempting standard features, such as the twin windscreen wipers powered by their own electric motor, the (semaphore style) direction indicators, the clock included on the instrument panel, the twin sun visors and the switchable reserve section of the fuel tank. The range Even by 1930s standards, the range of different 402 models based on the single chassis was large, comprising at one stage, by one estimate, sixteen different body types, from expensive steel bodied convertible cars, to family saloons which were among the most spacious produced in France. An aspect of the all- steel car bodies that became mainstream among the larger European automakers in the 1930s was the very high initial cost associated with the heavy steel presses and the dies needed to cut and stamp pressed steel sheeting into the panels that, when welded together, would form a sufficiently rigid and robust car body. The wide range of car bodies was therefore carefully devised to maximise the sharing of panels between the different body variants listed. Three chassis lengths There were three different standard wheelbases of (short), (‚Äúnormal‚Äù) and (long). = ‚Äúshort‚Äù wheelbase (1937-1940)= When the 402 was launched in 1935 there were just two chassis lengths, but for 1937 the manufacturer added a third ‚Äúshort‚Äù chassis, inherited from the short-lived Peugeot 302. The short chassis was used from 1937 for the Peugeot 402 L√©g√®re (‚Äúlight-bodied‚Äù). The Peugeot 402 L√©g√®re was first exhibited in July 1937 and was featured on the Peugeot stand in place of the Peugeot 302 at that year's October Motor Show. The car combined the wheelbase and body from the Peugeot 302 with the larger 1991 cc engine of the Peugeot 402. Whereas the 302 had produced a maximum output of at 4,000 rpm, maximum power for the 402 L√©g√®re was listed as still at 4,000 rpm. That translated into a difference in listed top speed between 105 km/h (65 mph) and 125 km/h (78 mph). The simple formula of combining one existing bodyshell with another engine that was also already in production enabled the manufacturer to produce an attractively brisk car with minimum investment. Approximately 11,000 were produced. From the outside the 402 L√©g√®re was initially virtually indistinguishable from the 302. However, on the front grille, whereas on the 302 the hole for the starting handle corresponded with the central digit in the car's name spelled out on bottom part of the front grille, on the 402 L√©g√®re it was necessary to position the hole for the starting handle below the ‚Äú402‚Äù name badge because the engine itself was positioned very slightly higher. An improvement over the 302 available to the driver, albeit only at extra cost, was the option of a Cotal pre-selector transmission, which could be controlled using a selector lever positioned directly behind the steering wheel, so that the driver needed to move his/her hand only minimally in order to change gear. Although sources tend to refer to the 402 L√©g√®re as a single model, there was nevertheless a choice of at least three bodies. Priced at 24,900 Francs in October 1937 was the four door ‚Äú402 L√©g√®re berline‚Äù (saloon/sedan) using the body already familiar from the 302. Not yet ready for presentation at the 1937 show, but nevertheless already priced (at 30,900 Francs) and advertised was the 402 L√©g√®re ‚Äúcoach‚Äù, which was a stylish thinner looking 2-door four seater car shaped somewhere between a sedan/saloon and coupe, with ‚Äúglass on glass‚Äù side windows (allowing for the possibility, with the windows open, of a ‚Äúpillarless‚Äù side profile) and front seats that tilted to permit access to the adequately spacious rear of the passenger cabin. Represented at the motor show by a prototype which differed in certain details from the cars that actually appeared a few months later was the 402 L√©g√®re ‚Äúd√©capotable‚Äù (soft-top convertible), priced at 31,900 Francs. Both the ‚Äúcoach‚Äù and the ‚Äúd√©capotable‚Äù bodied cars featured a slightly more streamlined look than the ‚Äúberline‚Äù, and their stylishness was enhanced by ‚Äúspats‚Äù covering the upper portions of the rear wheels. = ‚Äúnormal‚Äù wheelbase (1935-1942)= The standard bodied saloon/sedan (berline), first presented at the Paris Motor Show in the late Autumn of 1935 sat on the ‚Äúnormal‚Äù chassis and was advertised as a six-seater, the passengers being accommodated in two rows on bench seats in what was, by the standards of the time and place, an unusually wide car. The four door ‚Äúberline‚Äù came as a ‚Äú6 glaces‚Äù (‚Äúsix-light‚Äù or three windows on each side) saloon/sedan. In 1936 the price list showed the saloon as the least expensive of the ‚Äúnormal‚Äù wheelbase 402s, priced from 23,900 francs. Closely resembling the 402 berline ‚Äú6 glaces‚Äù, at first sight, was the 402 ‚Äúnormale commerciale‚Äù also offering seating for six people accommodated in two rows. However, at the back, in place of the more usual panels, the ‚Äúcommerciale‚Äù featured a two piece tailgate. The rear of the cabin was described as being ‚Äútransformable pour transport de marchandises‚Äù (transformable for transport of goods) which presumably would have involved lifting out the rear seat. Later on there were also 402 commerciales exhibited with semi-squared off rear roof lines along the lines of a steel bodied station wagon/estate car conversion, but most of the 402 commerciales shared, from the side, the silhouette of the 402 saloon/sedan, presumably in order to avoid the cost of tooling up for volume- style production of a relatively small number of uniquely shaped body panels. Other models appearing on the ‚Äúnormal‚Äù wheelbase at the 1936 show included a Grand-luxe berline with a sliding steel sun roof, a 4/5 seater 2-door soft-top cabriolet priced in October 1936 at 30,900 francs, a 5/6 seater ‚Äúcoach‚Äù (elegant two door saloon) priced at 29,900 francs, a 2/3 seater roadster at 27,900 francs and a ‚Äúcoup√© transformable √âclipse‚Äù which was a steel roofed convertible priced at 34,900 francs. The √âclipse was significant as the first of many Peugeot coupes with a steel roof that would fold and stow in the boot/trunk. The retractable hardtop mechanism had been designed, and in 1931 patented, by Georges Paulin: the mechanism was bulky by more recent standards and necessitated a very long tail end. Despite the generous length of the wheelbase, this first application of the technology came with just two seats. Interest in the √âclipse resurfaced more than half a century later with the ‚Äúreinvention‚Äù of the retractable hardtop by the 1995 Misubishi 3000GT Spyder and subsequent popularization of the concept by cars such as the Mercedes-Benz SLK-Class. Several of the body types were priced (and presumably costed) to be produced in relatively low volumes, and despite appearing at the Motor Show in October 1936, three had been delisted by the start of 1937. The delisted variants were the 5/6 seater ‚Äúcoach‚Äù, the 4/5 2-door soft-top cabriolet and the steel roofed ‚ÄúCoup√© transformable √âclipse‚Äù, although the third of these had already been effectively replaced in 1936 by a similar, but even longer, steel roofed convertible √âclipse, now with seating for 4/5 people and using the longest of the 402's three chassis lengths. = ‚Äúlong‚Äù wheelbase (1935-?1940)= The principal ‚Äúlong‚Äù Peugeot 402 in 1935 was the ‚Äú402 Familiale‚Äù, closely resembling the ‚Äúnormal‚Äù length six light ‚Äúberline, but with extra length used in the rear of the cabin to accommodate a third row of seats (‚Äústrapontins escamotables‚Äù) which could be folded away when not in use. By the time of the 1937 Motor show, in time for the 1938 model year, the 402 commerciale had also migrated from the ‚Äúnormal‚Äù to the ‚Äúlong wheelbase‚Äù. In addition, the manufacturer advertised a special taxi version of the long wheel base car, closely resembling the familiale and of which, it was boasted in 1937, several thousand were already in service ‚Äúin Paris and the [other] principal towns and cities in France or the colonies‚Äù.‚Äùles taxis 402 dont plusieurs milliers d‚Äôexemplaires ont √©t√© mise en circulation √† Paris et sans les principales villes de France ou des colonies, ont permis √† chacun d‚Äôappr√©cier les remarquables qualit√©s de confort, de s√©curit√© et de vitesse‚Ä¶.‚Äù Peugeot catalogue at the 1936 Motor Show Peugeot were slightly unusual among principal auto-makers at this time in never having acquired a Paris taxi business themselves, but the 402 taxi had nevertheless evidently been well received by independent taxi operators. Much attention at the 1936 show also focused on the ‚Äú402 cabriolet metallique decouvrable‚Äù which was a reincarnation of the √âclipse, but now using the ‚Äúlong‚Äù wheel base which made enough space for a (rather cramped) second bench seat. Light commercial van and utility variants of the 402 were also produced (or derived from conversion), and during the car's final years, during World War II, assumed increasing prominence within the range. Sources vary as to whether production was ended it 1942 or continued further, possibly till 1944. The engines Petrol/gasoline The car was launched with a four-cylinder water-cooled engine of 1991 cc with poppet valves. With its claimed the standard bodied car could achieve a top speed of at 4,000 rpm. In 1938 the capacity was raised to 2142 cc with the introduction of the Peugeot 402B, stated output now being . Given the wide range of body lengths and styles offered, there was and is correspondingly wide range of different performance figures quoted for the standard-engined 402. Other engine versions existed, with a claimed output of for a Darl'mat bodied performance coupe version. Diesel Peugeot had been making diesel engines in the north, at their Lille engine plant, since 1928, for use in boats, railcars and agricultural tractors. By 1936 the manufacturer had readied their HL50 series diesel engine for installation in light commercial vehicles. French regulations at the time did not permit the fitting of diesel engines in road vehicles except for trucks and commercial vehicles, and even for their relatively cautious approach to diesel power for the 402 it was necessary for Peugeot to obtain a special dispensation from the authorities. By the final weeks of 1938 several prototype 402s had been fitted with the HL50 diesel unit already being used for light trucks. During the early months of 1939 several dozen long bodied 402 \\"conduite interieure\\" saloons were fitted with diesel engines and sold into the taxi trade. The HL50 engine used was a 2,300 cc unit with a claimed power output of 55 hp. Had the diesel powered version entered production the 402 would have been one of the first diesel saloons available commercially. Fuel economy quoted for the 2.3 litre diesel unit was approximately 33% better than that for the 2.1 litre petrol powered 402. By the time war broke out, approximately 12, and possibly several dozen, diesel powered Peugeot 402s were in existence, but only one diesel powered 402 chassis still survived by the time the war came to an end.Mus√©e de l'Aventure Peugeot. The exhibit label (2012) states: ¬´Peugeot commence √† fabriquer des moteurs diesel a partir de 1928, √† la ¬´ Compagnie Lilloise des Moteurs ¬ª, filiale d‚ÄôAutomobiles Peugeot, notamment pour les tracteurs agricoles ou ferroviaires, les bateaux, etc. Le moteur Peugeot HL50, mis au point en 1936, est d‚Äôabord mont√© en s√©rie sur les utilitaires l√©gers MK. Les premiers essais sont fait en 402 en 1938, avant de lancer la production en s√©rie. En 1939, la guerre stoppe le d√©veloppement des 402 Diesel‚Ä¶..Consommation : 9 litres/100 km, en comparaison une 402 essence consommait 12 litres / 100 km.¬ª The development work was not wasted, however, and in 1959 Peugeot would launch one of the world's earlier diesel powered saloons, albeit beaten to the market by Mercedes Benz. Running gear Standard transmission was a three-speed manual system, driving through the rear wheels. The option of a Cotal three-speed automatic was offered, but this was an elaborate system more commonly seen on upmarket models from the likes of Delahaye and Delage. Priced in 1937 as a 2,500 Franc option (up from an already hefty 1,800 Francs in 1936), it was too expensive to appeal to most 402 buyers. Stopping the car was achieved using mechanical (cable operated) drum brakes: with the Citro√´n Traction already featuring hydraulic brakes, cable-operated brakes were beginning to be regarded as an old technology which compromised the innovative image presented by other aspects of the 402. Commercial Approximately 75,000 402s were produced during the seven or more years of production. It took Peugeot from the 1930s to the 1940s, covering two decades that saw a dramatic reduction in the number of automakers in France. Of the survivors, Citro√´n was taken over by the tyre/tire company Michelin in 1934 and Renault was nationalised in 1945. Peugeot survived and retained its independence. France declared war on Germany in 1939 and after this date cabriolet and convertible versions of the 402 disappeared from the price lists. The April 1940 price list shows only the standard bodied and long wheelbase saloons. Peugeot only became a regular supplier to the army in 1938, but during 1939 and 1940 several thousand 202s and 402s were operating with the armed services, the long wheel base 402 being a particular military favourite. The Peugeot 402 in a world without petrol war motor fuel for civilian use disappeared, and more than 2,500 Peugeots were adapted to run on gas generated through the controlled burning of charcoal in a boiler mounted on the vehicle. The 402 Longue was found to be particularly suitable for the conversion. The speed of the French defeat in June 1940 may have come as a shock, but the advent of another war with Germany and of resulting restrictions on civilian fuel availability had been widely foreseen. In 1939 Peugeot were already investigating the adaptation of petrol/gasoline engines to run on gas created by the controlled burning of charcoal. The technology would prove particularly suitable for the long bodied Peugeot 402 and for the Peugeot DMA light truck. On the car it was possible to fit the necessary components without excessive modification of the bodywork. A charcoal burning boiler, able to accommodate 35 kg of charcoal, was mounted on a stout platform at the back of the car. This provided sufficient power for approximately 80 km (50 miles) before more charcoal needed to be taken on board. The controlled burning of the charcoal produced carbon monoxide, known as gazog√®ne, which was captured and transferred in a stout pipe mounted on the outside of the right- hand C-pillar to a roof mounted gas tank. From here another stout pipe mounted on the outside of the right hand A-pillar drew the gazog√®ne down to the engine. Between 1940 and 1944 more than 2,500 Peugeots were equipped with a gazog√®ne fuel system.Mus√©e de l'Aventure Peugeot.

Simeon Wheelock House, built circa 1765, Now Deborah Wheelock Chapter, Daughters of the American Revolution, Uxbridge, Massachusetts Simeon Wheelock (March 29, 1741‚Äì September 30, 1786) was a blacksmith from Uxbridge, Massachusetts, who served as a minuteman in the Massachusetts militia during the battles of Lexington and Concord in the American Revolutionary War. After the war he was killed while on militia duty protecting the Springfield Armory during Shays' Rebellion. Family Wheelock was born to Colonel Silas Wheelock and Hannah Albee of Mendon, Massachusetts, on March 29, 1741. His father was a colonel. Simeon was a great-great grandson of Rev. Ralph Wheelock. Many of Simeon's brothers would also serve in the Revolutionary War. Ralph Wheelock, the original immigrant and Simeon's great grandfather, was the first teacher in the Dedham Public Schools, the first public school in America, founded in Dedham, Massachusetts in the 1640s. Life and career Simeon Wheelock served in the French and Indian War in 1760. He married Deborah Thayer of Mendon on November 28, 1763. They settled in Uxbridge that year, and would have eight children. He worked as a blacksmith in a shop adjacent to his home, which still stands in Uxbridge. Wheelock served as Town Clerk of Uxbridge for five years. With the approach of the American Revolution, Wheelock was a member of the committee of correspondence in Uxbridge in 1774. As first lieutenant in Capt. Joseph Chapin's company of minutemen, he answered the alarm on April 19, 1775, and fought at the battles of Lexington and Concord. His term of service at this time was for 15 days. Later, he served as Lieutenant in Capt. Samuel Read's company, in a regiment commanded by Lieut. Col. Nathan Tyler, from the alarm of December 8, 1776 to January 21, 1777, at Providence, Rhode Island. Simeon died in September 1786 at the age of 45 when his horse slipped on the ice while engaged in the suppression of Shays' Rebellion in Springfield. His son Jerry Wheelock was prominent in the textile industry in Uxbridge, joining forces with early woolen mill pioneer, Daniel Day. Shays' Rebellion had its opening salvos in Uxbridge, a year before. Shays' Rebellion was an uprising of farmers related to currency disarray after the Revolution. Lieutenant Simeon Wheelock house Simon Wheelock House in 2013 The home that Simeon and Deborah Wheelock built is now part of Uxbridge's many historic houses. It is located on North Main Street across from the Masonic Lodge building. Today, it is the local home of the Daughters of the American Revolution and is named for Deborah Wheelock. The building is well preserved as a museum. It was built in 1768 and is located at 33 North Main Street. There are a number of Revolutionary War soldiers and officers from this community.

It was introduced at the 1934 Paris Motor Show and was again on display at the 29th Paris Show in October 1935. It featured in a full page newspaper advertisement placed by Peugeot in \\"L'Argus\\" on 10 October 1935, and disappeared from the manufacturer's price list only three months later, at the start of 1936, reflecting the need to dispose of an inventory backlog. Production of the 401 had already come to an end in August 1935, less than a year after the model's introduction. Details The 401 was powered by an enlarged version of the engine from the smaller Peugeot 301 and slotted between that model and the range-topping 601. The 401's four cylinder side- valve engine displaced 1,720 cc and produced at 3,500 rpm. Models of the 401 include the 401 D, 401 DL, and 401 DLT. Though the majority were made as sedans, the 401 was offered with no fewer than eleven different body styles. Eclipse Peugeot conceived of an electric folding metal roof more than twenty years before Ford reimagined the concept in their Skyliner. This system was called \\"Eclipse\\" and was first introduced on the 401. A total of 79 Peugeot 401 Eclipses were made.

It had its formal launch on 5 May 1934 and marked a return by the manufacturer to six-cylinder engines. Powertrain The car was equipped with an inline 6-cylinder 2148 cc engine developing 60 hp at 3500 rpm. With limited power and relatively high weight, the car came with a listed top speed of only or .http://www.lecaav.com/601.htm The actual top speed would have varied according to the body fitted; the weight, including the car body, was given in 1934 as between and (or for some long wheelbase versions). A feature of the engine that attracted comment was the thermostatically controlled temperature regulator for the engine oil, which worked with an oil pump by redirecting the oil through, or away from, what was in effect a heat exchanger in a chamber filled with water from the radiator. Like other Peugeots of the era, the 601 was equipped with independent front suspension. Body The 601 was closely based on the manufacturer's recently rebodied 201 and 301 models, but the longer six cylinder engine of the 601 required a longer wheelbase. As launched, the 601 came with two different wheelbases: for the 601 \\"Normale\\" and for the 601 \\"Longue\\". There were three standard bodies offered for the \\"Normale\\" wheelbase cars: there was a four-door \\"Berline\\" (sedan/saloon) priced in Spring 1934 at 28,500 francs, a \\"Coach dƒócapotable\\" with two doors, four seats and a cabriolet roof, priced at 34,000 francs of which only a handful were sold, and a two-seater \\"Roadster\\" which became a frequent prize winner at \\"concours d'ƒólƒógance\\" enthusiasts' meetings. Four standard bodies were listed for the \\"Longue\\" wheelbase cars. The least costly, listed at 31,000 francs, was a six-light \\"limousine familiale\\" with four doors and a deep bench seat combined with large amounts of rear legroom. There was also a \\"Berline aƒórodynamique\\" with four doors and a streamlined body with a steeply raked tail and an overall length above , as well as a \\"Coach Sport\\" with two doors and four seats which exploited the longer wheelbase to support a low streamlined look. From the summer of 1934 there was another long two-door four-seater version listed, called the \\"Coach Profilƒó\\" . There was in addition a special Eclipse body with electrical folding metal roof. The Eclipse was made by designer Georges Paulin, Emile Darl'mat and the coachbuilder Pourtout. This car gained renewed attention courtesy of the Peugeot publicity department in 1996 with the launch of the Mercedes-Benz SLK: the Mercedes featured a hinged steel roof that automatically folded into the boot/trunk at the press of a button which was briefly claimed as a world first, until Peugeot pointed out that the 601 Eclipse had used the same arrangement (albeit with more bulky mechanical components) sixty years earlier. The 601 received a minor facelift for the 1935 model year, announced during the summer of 1934, only months after the car's launch: the most visible change was a lowering of the headlights. Commercial The sales figures of the 601 were affected by the underwhelming performance of the engine. Nevertheless, given the large number of manufacturers jostling for sales in the higher reaches of the French car market, a total of 3,999 Peugeot 601s produced during just eighteen months was a reasonable production volume for a 6-cylinder car. Discontinuation The 601 was taken out of production in 1935 after a production run lasting approximately eighteen months, leaving a gap at the higher end of Peugeot's range, which would be filled only 40 years later with the arrival of the Peugeot 604. The 604 was also the next Peugeot car with an engine having more than four cylinders; the 601 was the final straight-6-engined Peugeot, as the 604 was powered with a V6.

Flotilla 13) is a unit of the Israeli Navy and one of the primary sayeret (reconnaissance) units of the Israel Defense Forces. Shayetet 13 specializes in sea-to-land incursions, counter-terrorism, sabotage, maritime intelligence gathering, maritime hostage rescue, and boarding. The unit is trained for sea, air and land actions. The unit has taken part in almost all of Israel's major wars, as well as other actions. The unit is one of the most secretive in the Israeli military. The details of many missions and identities of active operatives are kept highly classified. The unit is respected as among the best of the world's special forces, and is compared to the US Navy SEALs and Britain's Special Boat Service. Unlike many other Israeli Special Forces Units which take men only for their 36-month mandatory service, volunteers for Shayetet 13 must agree to service at least four and a half years (18 months over and above the normal commitment). Unit's Motto: \\"As the bat emerges from the darkness, As the blade cuts through with silence, As the grenade smashes in rage.\\" In addition the unit also referred to as \\"people of Silence\\". History Founding Yohai Ben-Nun, Hero of Israel, founder of the Shayetet 13, and sixth commander of the Israeli Navy Emblem of the palyam Shayetet 13 is a veteran Israeli special forces unit. It was formed in 1949 by Yohai Ben-Nun with men drawn from the ranks of the Palyam, the naval branch of the Palmach, the elite fighting force of the Haganah ancestor of the Israel Defense Forces. The need for such a dedicated unit was a matter of debate during the early years of the IDF, and the unit subsequently suffered size and budget restrictions. Upon its foundation, the existence of Shayetet 13 was a state secret, and its members wore general Israeli Navy insignia rather than their own unique one. Early years Shayetet 13 with the symbol of the Palmach in the former Palyam base in Caesarea, 1948 Shayetet 13 commandos participated in the 1956 Suez Crisis. They performed several failed reconnaissance missions before the war and later participated in the land campaign as regular soldiers. A plan for Shayetet 13 commandos to capture an Egyptian Navy frigate was almost put into action. The plan was called off because the elite unit's soldiers were deemed too valuable to risk for low- priority targets. In 1957, Shayetet 13 began to jointly train with the French Marine Commandos, and as a result, information about its existence began to leak. Two years later, the unit's soldiers were permitted to wear their distinctive bat insignia, and the existence of the unit was made public the year after that. In the late 1950s, Shayetet 13 commandos carried out a series of reconnaissance missions to monitor the deliveries of Soviet gunboats to Syria and monitor Lebanon during the 1958 Lebanon crisis. On July 9, 1958, Shayetet 13 operatives infiltrated Beirut harbor in Operation Yovel. They were spotted and had to retreat, swimming back out to sea where an Israeli Navy torpedo boat picked them up and exchanged fire with a Lebanese patrol craft that intervened. The Israelis were able to retreat without any casualties. In 1962, it participated in a joint operation with the Golani Brigade against Syrian positions in the Golan Heights in retaliation for Syrian firing on Israeli fishermen. While the Golani force was successful, the Shayetet 13 force failed to complete its mission, a raid on a Syrian post in Kursi, and retreated without casualties after coming under fire. The fiasco became known as \\"Operation Rabbit\\". In August 1966, the unit was given the mission of retrieving the wreckage of a Syrian Air Force MiG that had been shot down and crashed into the Sea of Galilee. Near the end of the operation, Syrian troops opened fire, and the salvage rope attached to the aircraft was dropped. The Syrians were later able to pick it up and drag their aircraft to safety. Six-Day War During the 1967 Six-Day War, the unit was tasked with neutralizing enemy fleets. Shayetet 13 commandos infiltrated Port Said, but found no ships there, and during a raid into Alexandria, six divers were captured and taken prisoner, and released in January 1968. Several other missions also failed. In July 1967, Shayetet 13 commandos crossed the Suez Canal and blew up an Egyptian rail line in two places. The operation was carried out in retaliation for Egyptian shelling. Operation Barak was an Israeli naval mission to fly the flag in the Suez Canal carried out in July 1967, following Egyptian artillery attacks and firing on Israeli ships in the Suez Canal. Shayetet 13 participated in the operation. The operation was carried out in daylight, and the Egyptians opened fire from their positions, sinking a boat. War of Attrition Shayetet 13 saw extensive action in the War of Attrition. It carried out repeated commando raids in the Suez Canal area, often assisting Sayeret Matkal. Throughout 1969 the unit carried out a series of land-based mining, maritime patrol, and sabotage missions. On the night of June 21, 1969, Shayetet 13 carried out Operation Frenzy 5. After a preliminary reconnaissance mission by a Shayetet 13 team a month before, a force of commandos attacked an Egyptian guard post after landing from the sea, killing 32 Egyptian soldiers and blowing up five buildings, with the only Israeli casualties being two commandos slightly injured.https://web.archive.org/web/20111015235836/http://www.idf.il/1415-10812-he/Dover.aspx In July 1969, the unit successfully carried out the Green Island raid in cooperation with Sayeret Matkal. Three of the six Israeli soldiers killed during the operation were Shayetet 13 operatives. The Egyptians lost approximately 80 soldiers. On September 7, 1969, Shayetet 13 carried out Operation Escort, raiding the Egyptian anchorage at Ras Sadat and destroying a pair of Egyptian P-183 torpedo-boats. Three commandos were killed on the way back from the mission when one of their charges detonated. Escort, nevertheless, allowed the IDF to carry out Operation Raviv, a highly successful 10-hour raid on Egypt's Red Sea coast. During the 1970s, the unit underwent a reorganization, with more emphasis placed on sea-to-land incursions and on effective training. More issues rose with other IDF Special Forces units, which at the time suggested that Shayetet 13 should only provide the transportation to the target and assistance in crossing water obstacles, while leaving the surface warfare to the other IDF Special Forces units. =Operation Blanket= In 1970, in response to the persecution of Syrian Jews and their efforts to flee to Israel, the Israeli government launched Operation Blanket to bring them to Israel. In an operation directed by the Mossad lasting a few years, Shayetet 13 commandos and Mossad officers made dozens of clandestine incursions into Syria, with the participants having to resort to living undercover in Damascus. The operation succeeded in bringing only a few dozen young Jews to Israel.Johnson, Loch K.: Strategic Intelligence, p. 72 =Operation Wrath of God= Shayetet 13 took part in Operation Spring of Youth in 1973, in which Israeli special forces raided Beirut and killed several members of Black September, the terrorist group which carried out the Munich massacre of Israeli athletes in the Munich 1972 Summer Olympics. The Shayetet 13 force that participated in the operation landed in north Beirut and destroyed a small Fatah explosives workshop. Yom Kippur War During the Yom Kippur War, Shayetet 13 commandos infiltrated Egyptian ports numerous times, sinking five Egyptian naval vessels and heavily damaging another. Two commandos went missing during one of the raids. Lebanon Operation Bardas 20 took place on January 14, 1971, to neutralize a guerrilla base in Lebanon, near Sidon, where about two dozen militants were training as frogmen. During the operation, the commandos destroyed some of the camp's buildings, and a number of guerrillas were wounded, including commander Abu Youssef. Shayetet 13, Unit 707, and Sayeret Tzanhanim commandos jointly raided guerrilla bases in Nahr al-Bared and Beddawi on February 19, 1973 in Operation Bardas 54‚Äì55. During the operation, about 40 guerrillas were killed and 60 wounded, and a Turkish military trainer was taken prisoner. In the years following the Yom Kippur War, Shayetet 13 carried out various missions against guerrilla boats and those who assisted them, with mediocre success. During Operation Litani in 1978, Shayetet 13 carried out ambushes, killing a senior enemy commander in one of them. From 1979 to 1981, the unit carried out 22 successful raids against guerrilla targets in Lebanon. The successes resulted in a unit decoration. In one notable raid on April 19, 1980 Shayetet 13 commandos raided the base of a guerrilla organization that according to intelligence was planning an attack on a community in Israel, killing about 15 guerrillas, including the commander of the would-be infiltration unit and two of its members, and two structures were destroyed. Several commandos were wounded. During the 1982 Lebanon War, Shayetet 13 commandos participated in securing a beachhead for an Israeli amphibious landing north of Sidon. Two teams of commandos landed, one of which swam to the mouth of the Awali River and another which came ashore on the landing beach in rubber dinghies. The commandos engaged in a brief battle with armed Palestinians and enabled Israeli armor and infantry to land. The unit also carried out three raids on PLO targets in Beirut, and carried out several other raids and ambushes during the war. Shayetet 13 was also responsible for stopping ships that were ferrying weapons out of the country to Italy, including Yasser Arafat's personal vessel. From the early 1980s the unit became increasingly involved in the Lebanon conflict, demonstrating an excellent track record of dozens of successful operations each year and inflicting heavy losses on Hezbollah in terms of casualties and equipment destroyed. Typical missions at the time were interdiction of guerrilla vessels, blowing up enemy headquarters and key facilities, conducting ambushes and planting explosives on guerrilla routes. On November 25, 1988, the unit, along with other forces, conducted a raid on the base of PFLP-GC commander Ahmed Jibril. The IDF estimated that 20 guerrillas were killed in the raid. However, several commandos were killed, and Jibril managed to escape. =Ansariya Ambush= See Ansariya ambush On September 5, 1997, the unit suffered a major blow during a raid in Lebanon. A force of sixteen Shayetet 13 commandos landed on Lebanon's coast, south of Sidon between the towns of Loubieh and Ansariya. Speculation about their mission was that they were trying to assassinate a senior Shia Muslim cleric of the Hezbollah movement. They landed in the dark early hours of that Friday and started moving inland. The IDF said the force had been \\"on its way to its mission\\" when it was ambushed. Hezbollah and Amal commandos were lying in wait for them. The clash took place outside a 15-km deep security zone which Israel occupied in south Lebanon. The soldiers were ambushed after entering an orchard booby-trapped with bombs, which exploded as they entered.IDF encrypting drones after Hizbullah accessed footage By YAAKOV KATZ, Jerusalem Post10/27/2010 23:13 The commandos were knocked to the ground and came under heavy fire, killing the force's commander, Lt. Col. Yossi Korakin almost immediately. More commandos were killed when the firing triggered the explosives one of the commandos was carrying. Israel immediately dispatched a rescue team in a CH-53 helicopter. A rescue force of helicopters and missile boats arrived, joining in a battle that lasted until dawn as the rescuers evacuated the dead. Mortar shells exploded nearby, killing a doctor in the rescue force, and shrapnel hit the CH-53, but it was able to take off. The IDF lost twelve dead, including eleven Shayetet 13 commandos. Two Hezbollah fighters were lightly woundedBlanford 2011, p. 190 The uncollected remains of the Israeli soldiers were returned to Israel on June 25, 1998 in a prisoner exchange deal. After 14 years, Hezbollah revealed that they knew the position of the commandos in advance thanks to the interception of video footage broadcast by Israeli UAVs that were hovering over the area in the days before the mission. Operation Moses During the mid-1980s, Shayetet 13 played an active part in Operation Moses, which brought thousands of Ethiopian Jews to Israel. After the Mossad had established a diving resort on the Sudanese coast to serve a conduit for Jews fleeing Ethiopia, Shayetet 13 operatives would arrive on dinghies at night to ferry the refugees to an Israel Navy boat waiting offshore. Tunisia 1988 On April 16, 1988, Shayetet 13 commandos, along with Sayeret Matkal and Mossad operatives, took part in the assassination of Khalil al-Wazir at his home in Tunisia.Crenshaw, Martha: The Consequences of Counterterrorism, p. 344 Second Intifada During the Second Intifada, Shayetet 13 commandos took part in ground counter terror operations deep within the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Shayetet 13 participated in hundreds of operations against Hamas, Islamic Jihad and the Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades, killing dozens of militants and arresting hundreds. Shayetet 13 snipers were responsible for the assassination of Thabet Thabet, a senior Fatah political official in Tulkarm. The unit also participated in the Battle of Jenin. It earned high acclaim due to the successful capture of three Palestinian vessels which attempted to smuggle in weapons: Karine A, Santorini and Abu-Yusuf. The Karine A incident, in particular was considered a highly difficult operation. In 2004, the unit's operations were temporarily suspended following a complaint from B'Tselem, an Israeli human rights group, that Shayetet 13 operatives had shot an unarmed Palestinian fighter in Jenin for no reason. An investigation found that the commandos had good reason to assume the guerrilla was concealing a grenade, and the unit was put back into action. In 2002 and again in 2003, Shayetet 13 won the Chief-of-Staff citation for successful counter terrorism operations. 2006 Lebanon War On August 5, 2006, during the 2006 Lebanon War, Shayetet 13 commandos carried out the Tyre raid. The commandos raided an apartment block in Tyre which was allegedly housing Hezbollah commanders. According to Israeli sources, between 6 and 10 Hezbollah fighters were killed.https://www.haaretz.com/1.4860288https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3286565,00.html Lebanese sources claimed that one or two Hezbollah fighters, a Lebanese soldier, and at least four civilians were killed in the operation. Ten commandos were wounded in the raid, two of them severely. The IDF admitted that the senior Hezbollah commanders who had been the primary target of the raid had managed to escape.https://www.haaretz.com/1.5127598 Syria 2008 According to the Sunday Times, Shayetet 13 snipers on a yacht were responsible for the assassination of Syrian General Muhammad Suleiman. Operation Cast Lead During Operation Cast Lead, which lasted from December 2008 to January 2009, Shayetet 13 commandos landed on the Gaza Strip coastline to strike Hamas targets on land. They were also reportedly involved in two Israeli airstrikes in Sudan against Iranian-supplied arms being smuggled into the Gaza Strip. The strikes hit a 17-truck convoy carrying arms, and an Iranian arms ship docking in Sudan. Francop Affair On 4 November 2009, the Antiguan-flagged vessel MV Francop which had been carrying arms and munitions from Iran to Hezbollah was successfully boarded and taken over by Shayetet 13 commandos. The commandos subsequently found the well-hidden weapons. Gaza flotilla operation On May 31, 2010, Shayetet 13 took part in Operation Sea Breeze or Operation Sky Winds against a flotilla trying to break the blockade of Gaza. The commandos, armed with non-lethal weaponry and 9mm pistols as sidearms, roped down from helicopters and boarded from speedboats, and apprehended five ships with mostly passive resistance. Aboard the MV Mavi Marmara, the commandos were attacked by dozens of activists armed with knives, iron bars, slingshots and improvised weapons, and allegedly with firearms, including those seized from commandos. Three soldiers were captured, carried below deck, and were temporarily held in a passenger hall. The commandos initially used non-lethal force, but after this proved ineffective, they opened fire with live ammunition and seized control of the ship. Nine activists were killed,Washington Post, 1-06-2010, \\"Israeli troops raid aid flotilla headed for Gaza, killing nine\\" and several dozen were wounded. Seven commandos were also wounded, two of them seriously. International condemnation of the action followed. Subsequently, Shayetet 13 commandos boarded and seized the aid ship MV Rachel Corrie with no resistance. Victoria Affair On March 15, 2011, Shayetet 13 took part in \\"Operation Iron Law,\\" conducted on the high seas against the Liberian-flagged, German-owned Victoria, a cargo vessel found to be carrying 50 tons of weapons which intelligence reports indicated had been consigned to Hamas. The Victoria was interdicted approximately 200 nautical miles from the Israeli coast, as it traveled from Turkey to El-Arish port in Egypt (other sources give the destination as Alexandria, Egypt). According to the Israel Defense Forces, Victoria loaded the cargo in the port of Latakia in Syria and sailed to Mersin, Turkey. The ship was intercepted by Israeli Navy Sa'ar 5-class corvettes and boarded by commandos from Shayetet 13, without resistance. The IDF has stated that the ship's crew was unaware it was carrying weapons, as they were concealed in 39 of the 100 containers on deck beneath bags of Syrian lentils and cotton. When seized by Shayetet 13, Victoria was redirected to the Port of Ashdod. There, further inspections were conducted and the contraband was unloaded. Israel then announced it would release the ship and allow Victoria to continue to the Egyptian port of Alexandria. Operation Protective Edge During the 2014 Israel-Gaza conflict, code-named Operation Protective Edge, Shayetet 13 carried out numerous missions against rocket-launching positions. On July 13, Shayetet 13 commandos raided a compound from which long-range rockets were being fired with the support of helicopters and warships, killing three Hamas fighters for the loss of four lightly injured.https://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-4542405,00.html Operation Full Disclosure On March 5, 2014, Shayetet 13 commandos raided the ship Klos C, an Iranian ship heading for Port Sudan from Iraq with weapons believed to have been destined for militant groups. Other operations Many of Shayetet 13's missions are classified, though some known or suspected activities of the unit have been revealed by other means. In one example, Zeev Almog, the former commander of the unit, remarked that during his time, 23 ships were raided and 7 sunk by the unit, without elaborating. Organization Shayetet 13 operatives during training Shayetet 13 has an estimated 300 personnel divided into three specialized company-sized units (Hebrew: Pluga), these include:https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/israel/navy- squadron13.htm * Haposhtim (raids) unit - is the primary unit of Shayetet 13. Their missions include special reconnaissance and direct-action missions on land, maritime counter-terrorism and hostage rescues. * Underwater unit - the offensive divers unit. Its missions range from underwater attacks and sabotage, to hydrographic reconnaissance, beachhead reconnaissance and security. Not to be confused with the defensive divers YALTAM unit. * Above water unit - is similar to a Special Boat Teams and specializes in surface attacks, sea transportation of units to and from target areas. Training Shayetet 13 commandos prepare for an exercise aboard a warship The training of Shayetet 13 recruits lasts 20 months, and is considered one of the toughest courses in the IDF. Shayetet 13 operates a summer course for teenagers about to enter military service considering joining the unit, who have the opportunity to get a taste of training in diving, raids, navigation, boats, and more. Those who enlist in Shayetet 13 are put through a five-stage training process: * Selection process. A selection camp to recruit for the unit is held twice a year. All recruits must have a Medical Profile of 97. All combatants must be male, though women can serve in positions such as electronic warfare and navigation within the unit. Cadets undergo extensive medical tests, after which they are put through a series of physically and mentally grueling exercises for four days. Doctors and psychologists are at hand to prevent burnout and physical injury. This phase stresses psychological toughness, and tests recruits in their ability to take and operate under stress and fear. Few succeed in passing this phase. * Six months of basic and advanced infantry training with the Nahal Brigade. * Preparation phase: this phase lasts for three months and consists of advanced infantry and weapons training, parachute training, basic elements of maritime warfare, operation of small vessels, long swims, forced marches, and demolitions. * Four weeks of advanced training in combat diving. During this course, cadets learn the basics of combat diving, and how to cope with situations such as cold, darkness, clouded water, and how to survive high-risk underwater situations. * Dedicated phase. This is the most rigorous phase of training which lasts about a year, and most of the dropouts leave during this phase. This phase includes training in advanced diving techniques with close-circuit systems, underwater demolition, sea-to-land incursions via diving, ships, submarines, and parachuting into the sea. The unit's snipers also undergo six weeks of sniper training, divided into three weeks of long-range sniper training at the IDF Sniper School, and three weeks of short-range sniper training for hostage situations at the IDF Counter-Terror School. Cadets then train in maritime counter-terrorism operations, such as the boarding of vessels, oil rigs and near-coast buildings. During this phase, soldiers are divided between the three specialized units based on their capabilities and personal interests, and train on their future specialty. During their training, cadets are trained in a variety of martial arts, among them Krav Maga, a hand-to-hand combat system which is Israel's national martial art. Toward the end of their training, Shayetet 13 recruits go through a course in enduring enemy captivity which recruits from other special forces units and pilot cadets must also go through. Following a surprise mock kidnapping, they are held in prison-like conditions for two weeks, during which they subjected to threats, interrogation, and physical violence, and are forced to perform humiliating activities. Even after their induction into active service, Shayetet 13 commandos continue to take part in training exercises, and participate in cross-training with foreign special forces units such as the US Navy SEALs.

He was both a field entomologist and an applied entomologist. He is most noted for the work he did to identify and control the agricultural pests in the Florida citrus industry. He was also an early pioneer in the study of cave insects. Biography Hubbard was born on May 6, 1850 in Detroit, Michigan. His parents were Bela Hubbard and Sarah (Baughman) Hubbard. Bela was a native of Hamilton, N. Y. and in 1835 moved to Michigan where he became a prominent and wealthy citizen of Detroit.Dict. Am. Bio. (1936) Bela had a strong scientific interest in geology, botany, forestry, arboriculture, and archaeology. This interest was passed along to his oldest son, Henry, who became familiar with the habits of the wild creatures in the neighborhood of Detroit at an early age.Schwarz (1901) Henry Hubbard was educated at a private school in Cambridge, Massachusetts and then spent several years studying with private tutors in Europe. He entered Harvard University in 1869 and worked closely with Hermann August Hagen, Karl Robert Osten-Sacken, and especially Eugene Amandus Schwarz, who became Hubbard's lifelong friend. Under their influence he was determined to become an entomologist when he graduated in 1873. After graduation, he briefly spent time as a post-graduate working under Hagen to study the hibernation of Coleoptera (beetles) during winter. In May, 1874, he returned to Detroit with Schwarz to start a private museum and form a great collection of beetles. In company with Schwarz, they made several collecting trips in and around Detroit in 1874, through Florida in 1875, and then, in 1876, a series of expeditions to the region of Lake Superior. The collection they built was reviewed favorably by the entomologists attending the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, held in Detroit in 1875. John Lawrence LeConte, the noted coleopterist, declared that the wealth of new specimens would force him to adjust parts of his beetle classification scheme.Mallis (1971) While on a trip with his uncle in 1877, Hubbard studied and collected termites in Jamaica. He next joined the Geological Survey of Kentucky as a naturalist in 1879, studying the fauna of Mammoth Cave and other caves in the region. The resulting paper, Two Days' Collecting in the Mammoth Cave (1880) was said to mark the beginning of the scientific study of cave life. He later wrote about cave fauna in Jamaica (1880) and Florida (1901). Other papers he published expressed a similar interest in the assemblages of insects found in unique micro-habitats such as tortoise burrows (1894), Yellowstone hot springs (1891), saguaro cactus (1899) and desert rodent burrows (1901). When two of his brothers were drowned in a boating accident on Lake St. Clair in 1879, Hubbard moved to Crescent City, Florida where one of the brothers had owned an estate. Hubbard designed and built a home on the property and lived there for several years. He created a beautiful subtropical garden around the home which became famous as \\"Hubbard Park\\". The Hubbard House still stands and was placed on the National Registry of Historic Places. The surrounding gardens no longer exist.Greer (1973) In 1880, Hubbard was appointed a special agent for the United States Entomological Commission and he began an intensive study of the insect pests affecting the Florida citrus crops. In 1885 he published his best-known work, Insects Affecting the Orange. It remained the standard authority for many years and was praised as one of the most careful studies of insect pests yet published. He also developed a kerosene-soap emulsion that proved to be an effective control for scale insects and other citrus pests.Michigan Bio. Dict. (1998) For the next few years he devoted himself to horticultural work, developing his garden and consulting with other horticulturalists. By 1889 he rededicated himself to entomology and made several collecting trips across the country. In 1889 he revisited Lake Superior; in 1890 Montana; in 1891 he and Schwarz traveled to the Wasatch Mountains in Utah, Lake Tahoe in California, and Yellowstone Park; and in 1892 they visited Oregon, Washington and British Columbia. In 1894 he accompanied Charles Valentine Riley on a collecting trip to the British West Indies. After Florida's \\"Great Freeze\\" in 1896, Hubbard studied the ambrosia beetles that infested the dead and dying citrus trees. By 1896 Hubbard's health had declined significantly from tuberculosis that had infected him for several years. In an effort to improve his health, he spent much of his time in Arizona in 1897 and 1898, studying insects with his friend Schwarz. However, his health continued to deteriorate and he died on January 19, 1899. Hubbard married Kate Lasier in 1887 and together they had four children. Selected works Hubbard published approximately 68 papers, including: * 1877: Notes on the tree nests of termites in Jamaica. * 1878: (with Schwarz, E.A) The Coleoptera of Michigan. * 1880: Two Days' Collecting in the Mammoth Cave. * 1885: Insects Affecting the Orange * 1891: Insect Life in the Hot Springs of Yellowstone National Park. * 1894: The Insect Guests of the Florida Land Tortoise. * 1897: The Ambrosia Beetles of the United States.

Biography Hammond was the third son of the five children of Dr John Hammond (c. 1555‚Äì1617), physician to the royal household under James I, who purchased the site of Chertsey Abbey in Surrey in 1602. In 1642, at the start of the English Civil War he was commissioned as an artillery officer. As he was an experienced officer he must have seen military service in the continental wars that preceded the Civil War although there is no direct evidence of this. His motives for joining the Parliamentary side against King Charles I are not recorded but his radicalism was evident by 1644 when he testified against his own commander-in-chief, Edward Montagu in favour of Oliver Cromwell. Between 1647 and 1649 he was active member of small committee that represented the interests of the Grandees in the New Model Army in their dealings with the Long Parliament, the Agitators in the army with their and their Leveller allies, and King Charles. Was named as a Commissioner at the High Court of Justice for the trial of Charles I and attending no fewer than fourteen of its sittings, but he did not sign the death warrant. His motives for not signing are not recorded. Hammond did not take part in the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland or in the initial invasion of Scotland, but he joined Cromwell at a later date. While in Scotland he fell seriously ill. His health appears never to have fully recovered and he resigned his commission in 1652. After his retirement he was occupied with obtaining pay arrears due to himself and the other personnel of the artillery train that he had commanded. He was granted Irish lands for his part in the initial campaign of 1642, and along with his men lands confiscated from Royalists in Middlesex and Surrey. In 1657 with his health failing he made his will and he died the next year shortly before his old friend and former commander Oliver Cromwell. After the Restoration his name was exempted from the Indemnity and Oblivion Act allowing the state to confiscate the property that had belonged to him.

The fast attack craft was built by Brooke Marine in the 1970s for the Royal Navy of Oman. Until 1911 the company, which produced engines and motor cars, sub-contracted its boat building operations to another firm in Oulton Broad. In 1911 it opened a shipyard on the north side of Lake Lothing and began to produce its own craft, all using engines produced at its Adrian Works in the town. Car production stopped in 1913, although the company continued producing engines until 1938, in total producing more than 7,000. During World War I the company established a munitions factory. Following the war, the shipyard was expanded to produce boats up to in length. During World War II, the company produced and serviced Motor Launches and landing craft for the Royal Navy and other Allied forces. In 1940, the company was acquired by Harry Dowsett and renamed Brooke Marine. In 1954, a new shipyard was built on the south side of Lake Lothing. The old yard was closed in 1955, and in 1975 was sold and levelled. The first ships produced at the new yard were twenty fishing trawlers ordered by the Russian government.

From 1871 it was also part of the German Empire. During World War II Giebu≈Çt√≥w was the location of the Nazi German slave labour camp called FAL Gebhardsdorf, one of nearly one hundred subcamps of the Gross- Rosen concentration camp system. The prisoners included 500 Jewish women from Poland and Hungary, who were transported after a selection at Auschwitz, to work for the airplane parts manufacturer Aerobau ‚Äì Heinrich Lehmann KG in Gebhardsdorf / Isergebirge. They were sent on a death march westward on 18 January 1945. This region was finally ceded to Poland in 1945 after the border shift after the defeat of Nazi Germany in the war.

His brother, Angelo, formed an opera company in Prague around 1732, consisting of three male singers and five females; Pietro quickly followed suit, and the two troupes achieved European-wide success (though mostly in German and Austrian cities), sometimes performing together. Pietro's company, the more high-profile of the two, at times included Christoph Willibald Gluck and Giuseppe Sarti as members. Most of the works performed belonged to the genre of opera seria, though opere buffe were also given. After performances at the coronation of Franz I at Frankfurt (Maria Theresa's husband) in 1745, and at a royal wedding at Dresden in 1747 (when Gluck's Le nozze d'Ercole e d'Ebe, with the composer conducting, was performed), Mingotti's troupe were invited to Copenhagen by Queen Louise in the same year. The company's repertory for the Danish court included not only operas but also ballets. Sarti joined the troupe in December 1752 as music director after Gluck left during 1750. Severe financial difficulties forced Pietro to end his contract with the court at Copenhagen in 1755, and he died impoverished four years later in the Danish capital. Little is known of Angelo Mingotti's later career; from 1743 until 1751 the Oper am G√§nsemarkt was used by Angelo Mingotti, performing Italian operas.Marx, H.J. & D.

The film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. Plot Two young lovers, Dominique and Gilbert, are found in the aftermath of an attempted murder-suicide. Gilbert is dead from multiple gunshots, while Dominique is unconscious and near death from gas inhalation. Dominique is revived, arrested, and put on trial for the murder of Gilbert. Her life story and the circumstances leading up to the crime are recounted in detail, leading to a series of flashbacks intercut with the trial. Dominique is the elder of two sisters, who live in a small provincial town with their parents. The younger sister, Annie, is a studious aspiring violinist, while Dominique avoids work and leads a directionless, leisurely lifestyle. When Annie moves to Paris for music school, Dominique wants to join her, overdosing on pills when their parents refuse. After this, Dominique gets her way and the sisters move in together. Dominique falls in with a group of rebellious young intellectuals, earning herself a reputation for promiscuity. Gilbert, an ambitious young conductor, befriends Annie and visits the apartment, finding a nude Dominique who flirts with him. After this, Annie kicks Dominique out of the apartment. Gilbert becomes infatuated with Dominique, though they are polar opposites in terms of values and personality. Eventually they begin a turbulent relationship, during which Dominique takes an uncharacteristically long amount of time to consent to Gilbert's sexual advances, impulsively sleeping around with other men in the meantime. Gilbert is jealous and frustrated, but remains committed to Dominique. After they finally consummate their relationship, he proposes to her but she refuses. They move in together, but their differing lifestyles lead to further contention, and Dominique cheats on him, after which he beats her. The landlady evicts Dominique from Gilbert's flat, leading her to take a job at a restaurant to pay her own rent. Gilbert becomes suspicious that Dominique is involved with the restaurant owner, Toussaint. This leads to an emotional breakup, as Dominique insists nothing is going on with Toussaint while Gilbert refuses to believe her. Dominique sleeps with Toussaint after the breakup, then quits her job and becomes homeless, turning to prostitution. While visiting her hometown for her father's funeral, she learns that Annie is now engaged to Gilbert. Dominique visits Gilbert, begging him to take her back. He accepts her advances and sleeps with her once more, then coldly turns her away the next morning. Dominique promptly steps in front of a bus, though she survives with minimal injury and denies that it was a suicide attempt. Later that day, Gilbert hastily finalizes his marriage vows to Annie. Dominique purchases a gun and sneaks back to Gilbert's apartment, initially claiming she intends to kill herself in front of him. As Gilbert berates and insults her, she turns the gun on him instead, emptying it into him and leaving her without a bullet to commit suicide. After the shooting, she breaks down sobbing then seemingly laughing. Her suicide attempt with the gas line is not shown until its aftermath. Over the course of the trial, Dominique's defense attorney Guerin characterizes the killing as an impulsive crime of passion borne out of genuine love for Gilbert, while the prosecutor, Eparvier, attacks and condemns Dominique as manipulative and selfish, engineering the entire relationship and the eventual murder out of resentment towards Annie; Eparvier also calls into question the seriousness of Dominique's various suicide attempts. Dominique grows increasingly emotional over the course of the trial. Guerin adapts his defense strategy to portray Gilbert as the manipulator and Dominique as the victim; this finally drives Dominique to an outburst, insisting to the courtroom that she and Gilbert genuinely loved each other. That night, she attempts suicide again, slitting her wrist. This time she is successful, and the judge announces her death to the court the following day, dismissing the case. Despite their impassioned arguments during the trial, Eparvier and Guerin quickly resume their friendly rapport the moment the trial is over. Eparvier is slightly shaken by the suicide and expresses guilt over his own culpability, whereas Guerin is indifferent and reassures his colleague it is simply a \\"professional hazard\\" while turning his attention to the next case.

Philippus' own epigrams, of which over seventy are extant, are generally rather dull, chiefly school exercises, and, in the phrase of Jacobs, imitatione magis quam inventione conspicua (more like imitation than striking innovation).

History and character Commissioned by Strathclyde Regional Council, each work features an instrumental soloist and small orchestra. The first concerto, for oboe and orchestra, appeared in 1986, with the tenth and last work, for full orchestra in 1996, the year Strathclyde Regional Council was abolished. Funding was also supplied by the Scottish Arts Council. The plan was that each concerto was to be used as a teaching tool. As each concerto was finished, a young composer chosen by the Council would visit the schools in a particular region of Strathclyde and would address the students concerning the concerto and the process of its composition. Then, the students would be asked to create compositions of their own. Also, the soloist for each concerto would visit the schools in the region and discuss the concerto from the performer's point of view. Davies spotlights the soloists in some of the concertos by eliminating the instrument's counterparts in the orchestra. In the First Strathclyde Concerto, for oboe (1986), the orchestra does not include any oboes or bassoons. Likewise, in the Third Strathclyde Concerto, for horn and trumpet (1989), Davies excludes all of the brass instruments from the orchestra. For the Sixth Strathclyde Concerto, for flute (1991), Davies went even farther by removing all of the flutes, oboes, and violins from the orchestra, and by severely limiting the trumpet parts. The fifth concerto, on the other hand, sets the solo violin and viola against a normal string orchestra, and the seventh also uses an orchestra with a normal string section to accompany the solo double bass. The most demanding of the solo parts most likely lies in the Second Strathclyde Concerto, for cello (1987). In the last two of the Strathclyde Concertos, Davies increased the number of soloists. The Ninth (1994) is scored for six woodwind soloists, while the Tenth (1996) is a concerto for orchestra whose finale is a sort of recapitulation of ideas heard in the earlier concertos. The first two concertos were recorded by Unicorn-Kanchana, with the composer conducting. The remainder were recorded by Collins Classics.

Ownership In December 2002, McClure Broadcasting, Inc., (Chuck McClure Jr., president) reached an agreement to sell this station to Archway Broadcasting Group (Al Vicente, president/CEO). This was part of a four-station deal, along with WRLD-FM, WRCG, and WKCN, for a reported combined sale price of $15 million. At the time of the sale, WCGQ carried an adult contemporary music format. History WGBA-FM and WHYD-FM WGBA-FM signed on in 1964. The station was owned by WGBA, Inc. It was relaunched as WHYD-FM \\"Hydee\\" in 1971; it aired an automated country music format. WCGQ At 6 a.m. on December 26, 1973, WHYD-FM became WCGQ and flipped from country to Top 40. The first on-the-air announcement on WCGQ was made by WCGQ start-up consulting Program Director, David Tate: \\"This is WCGQ, Columbus, Georgia, 'The New 107-Q', where the Rock revolution starts NOW\\". Then, Tate played the first musical selection ever broadcast on WCGQ, Revolution, recorded by the British pop band, The Beatles. Indeed, a Rock revolution did begin at WCGQ-FM that day. WCGQ trounced its direct competitor, WDAK, in only 4 months. In the April/May, 1974 Arbitron ratings Radio Market Report for Columbus, GA, WCGQ became the leading FM popular music radio station in the Columbus, GA metropolitan area. 107-Q's earliest musical style was marked by a decidedly eclectic, \\"left-of-center\\", musical mixture, featuring playlists with artists like David Essex, Ian Thomas, Bachman-Turner Overdrive (which was called, \\"underground\\" music at the time) and Jimi Hendrix. Also, WCGQ played songs by a number of \\"Southern Underground\\" bands and singers, including The Allman Brothers' Band, Black Oak Arkansas, Wet Willie and others. \\"Southern Rock\\" was crystallizing in the world of pop music at the very moment of WCGQ's inception. This \\"left-field\\" strategy was apparently by-design, in order to give WCGQ the initial veneer of being an \\"underground\\" FM station. But the presentation-style of WCGQ was purely in the \\"Top 40\\" mold, with a handful of Top 40 \\"shotgun\\", short, singing identifiers (\\"jingles\\") and high-energy radio announcers, often referred to in the radio trade as, \\"Boss Jocks\\". Kris Earl Phillips was the 6pm-10pm on-air host during the earliest days of WCGQ. Phillips eventually reached radio's most prominent Top 40 station, according to the Arbitron radio ratings, WHTZ-FM/New York, NY (a.k.a. \\"Z-100\\"), in 1991. In April, 1974, due to a business dispute between WCGQ management and David Tate's employer, Bill Parris Programming of Washington, DC, Tate was ordered to withdraw prematurely from the 107-Q project and Kris Earl Phillips actually guided 107-Q as Program Director through its first ratings period. But, by then, the start-up strategy had largely been set by Parris and Tate. Later, WCGQ was programmed directly by William B. Parris, of Bill Parris Programming of Washington, D.C. (who initially hired Tate to execute the 107-Q start-up) and the station took on a decidedly more \\"Urban\\" tenor. As a result, WCGQ attracted a large number of African-American listeners in WCGQ's city-of-license, Columbus, GA. By 1975, under the direction of Parris, WCGQ became the overall number one radio station in the Columbus, GA radio listening market. WDAK-AM's audience ratings fell into obscurity during the period after 1975. In the late 1970s, WCGQ increased its transmitting power to 100,000 watts and changed its operating frequency from 107.7 mHz to 107.3 mHz, in order to more effectively serve the growing Columbus metropolitan area. The station also began airing American Top 40 with Casey Kasem in 1977 for 6 years until replacing AT40 with Rick Dees Weekly Top 40 later on. In the late 1980s, WCGQ changed its over-the-air nickname from \\"107-Q\\" to its current nickname, \\"Q107.3\\". Curiously, the WCGQ \\"listener request line\\" telephone number still refers to its original FCC- allocated operating frequency, 107.7 mHz: (706) 322-1077. This studio telephone number has remained unchanged since the station originally signed-on in 1973. Notable Industry Accomplishments WCGQ holds the distinction of broadcasting the \\"Top 40\\" radio format longer than any other American commercial radio station: almost 40 years and still going. Acquisitions and Mergers On July 31, 2008, local investment group PMB Broadcasting LLC (headed up by Jim Martin) purchased this station along with Columbus-area sister stations WRLD-FM, WRCG, WCGQ, and WKCN from Archway Broadcasting Group LLC for a reported sale price of $7.2 million.

The station's broadcast license is held by Westburg Broadcasting Montgomery, LLC. The station was established in 1979. , the station is temporarily dark for financial reasons and seeking authorization from the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to remain silent for up to one year. Programming Before falling silent in June 2012, the then-WACQ broadcast an oldies music format to the greater Montgomery, Alabama, area. Since 1993, WACQ had been the home of local morning show \\"What's Going On\\", with Pete Cottle and Fred Randall Hughey as co-hosts. Trivia contests, oldies music, and local news made up the program, which aired weekday mornings. On weekends, there was a Saturday morning show hosted by local band director Michael Bird and a Sunday morning gospel music show. The station also aired a local newscast four times daily and network news every hour from the Alabama Radio Network and Citadel Media. Sports programming included the Alabama Crimson Tide Sports Network, Atlanta Braves baseball, and Reeltown Rebels high school football. The bulk of this programming shifted to WBIL (580 AM) on June 28, 2012. History Early days In 1977, Hughey Broadcasting Company, Inc., applied to the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for a construction permit for a new broadcast radio station. The FCC granted this permit on February 8, 1979. This new station would broadcast with 1,000 watts of power on a frequency of 1130 kilohertz, but only during daylight hours to protect KWKH in Shreveport, Louisiana, CKWX in Vancouver, British Columbia, and WBBR in New York City from skywave interference. The station was assigned call sign \\"WACQ\\". After construction and testing were completed, the station was granted its broadcast license on August 6, 1979. In May 1984, Hughey Broadcasting Company, Inc., agreed to sell WACQ to Buck Helms Broadcasting. The FCC approved the sale on June 27, 1984, and the transaction was completed on November 15, 1984. In July 1985, control of Buck Helms Broadcasting was transferred from Thelma P. Helms to A.B. \\"Buck\\" Helms. The FCC approved the move on July 30, 1985. The licensee had the station's call sign changed to \\"WSFU\\" on August 26, 1985. In December 1985, A.B. \\"Buck\\" Helms, doing business as Buck Helms Broadcasting, made a deal to transfer control of the radio station to original owner Fred Randall Hughey's Double H. Broadcasting, Inc. The FCC approved the assignment of license on May 6, 1986. Hughey had the FCC restore the original \\"WACQ\\" call sign on June 2, 1987. 1990s In June 1989, Double H Broadcasting, Inc., made a deal to sell WACQ to Richard P. Smith. The deal gained FCC acceptance on July 27, 1989, but the transaction was never completed. In November 1991, Double H Broadcasting transferred ownership of WACQ to Tiger Broadcasting Company, Inc. The FCC approved the deal on March 9, 1992, and the transaction was completed on March 26, 1992. This ownership was short-lived as in May 1994, Tiger Broadcasting Company, Inc., contracted to transfer WACQ's broadcast license to Tuskegee Communications Company, Inc. The FCC approved the move on June 29, 1994, and it was completed on August 31, 1994. Just months later, in January 1995, Tuskegee Communications Company, Inc., applied to the FCC to transfer WACQ to a new company called WACQ, Inc. The deal was approved by the FCC on February 14, 1995, and the transaction occurred on April 14, 1995. In June 1996, Tuskegee Communications Company, Inc., filed to transfer WACQ to Tiger Communications, Inc. The FCC approved the move on July 31, 1996, and the deal was completed on September 13, 1996. In January 1998, Tiger Communications, Inc., in turn filed an application to send the WACQ license to Hughey Communications, Inc. The move was approved by the FCC on March 9, 1998, and the transaction was completed on May 12, 1998. 2000s Former branding In October 1999, Hughey Communications, Inc., made a deal to sell the station to Progressive United Communications, Inc., of Heathrow, Florida. The deal gained FCC approval on December 10, 1999, and the transaction was completed on February 3, 2000. In July 2006, Progressive United Communications, Inc., transferred WACQ back to Hughey Communications, Inc. The FCC approved the transfer on September 8, 2006, and the deal was completed on December 4, 2006. Hughey Communications agreed to pay Progressive United Communications $106,000 plus forgive $50,000 in debt in exchange for the return of the WACQ broadcast license and station assets. This deal came as settlement of a 2003 civil suit between Hughey Communications and Progressive United Communications. In August 2006, Hughey Communications applied to the FCC to increase this class D station's daytime-only power from 1,000 to 25,000 watts. Whereas with the original 1,000 watt signal the station could operate at full power from sun-up to sunset, the new 25,000 watt power authorization means operating at sharply lower levels (1,000 watts) from sign-on until two hours after sunrise then again from two hours before sunset until sign-off to prevent skywave interference with KWKH, CKWX, and WBBR. The FCC granted a construction permit for this change on August 21, 2007, with an expiration date of August 21, 2010. With testing completed in October 2008, the station applied for a new broadcast license and this was granted on November 25, 2008. 2010s In 2006, WP Media Lending loaned Hughey Communications $225,000. This was rolled over into a \\"First Replacement Promissory Note\\" in March 2008, then a second note in November 2008, and a third in March 2009. The loan was declared in default in February 2010. In April 2011, Hughey Communications, Inc., filed an application with the FCC to transfer WACQ to Westburg Broadcasting Montgomery, LLC. The FCC approved the deal on May 24, 2011, and the transaction was completed on June 16, 2011. The transfer of ownership was in settlement of the defaulted loan from WP Media Lending to Hughey Communications that, as of December 31, 2010, had increased to $494.662.16 owed. This total included $402,527 in principal, plus unpaid interest, and legal fees. Fred Randall Hughey, former owner, temporarily continued to operate WACQ under a joint operating agreement with the new owners. Under the terms of the deal, Hughey Communications retained the rights to the \\"WACQ\\" call sign and announced plans to relocate them and the station's current programming to another station, then licensed as WBIL, in which he held partial ownership. Westburg Broadcasting Montgomery, LLC, principal David Westburg also owns Alabama radio stations WINL in Linden, and WXAL and WZNJ in Demopolis (all licensed to Westburg Broadcasting Alabama, LLC) plus stations in Colorado and New Mexico. Falling silent On October 20, 2011, Westburg Broadcasting Montgomery requested that the FCC grant the station special temporary authority to operate WACQ with reduced power. In support of the request, the licensee stated that it acquired the WACQ license as part of a foreclosure on the station and that the \\"current economic conditions combined with the less than successful operation of the station by the previous licensee\\" continued to require WACQ to either operate with reduced power or cease operation. This authority was granted on October 24, 2011. On March 9, 2012, Westburg Broadcasting Montgomery applied for an extension of the special temporary authority, citing the same economic conditions as in the original application. This was request approved by the FCC and is scheduled to expire on September 9, 2012. , the station is temporarily dark for financial reasons and seeking authorization from the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to remain silent for up to one year. Under the terms of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, as a matter of law a radio station's broadcast license is subject to automatic forfeiture and cancellation if they fail to broadcast for one full year. On July 19, 2012, the station's call sign was changed to WALQ. On October 10, 2015 WALQ returned to the air with a country music format.

Sacks (born 1950) is an expatriate South African painter living and working in the United States.  Life  Sacks was born in Port Elizabeth, South Africa, and grew up in Durban. His father was an obstetrician and taught at a black medical school. Sacks also studied medicine before transferring to the political science program at the University of Natal. As a student he gave speeches and organized anti-apartheid demonstrations. Sacks served a few months in the military, which was compulsory at the time, before receiving a scholarship to Princeton University.Joshua Rothman, \\"An Artist's Archeology of the Mind,\\" The New Yorker, March 18, 2019. After Princeton (B.A. 1973), he attended Oxford University as a Rhodes Scholar (M.Phil. 1976), and Yale University (PhD 1980). Sacks taught English at Johns Hopkins University between 1980 and 1996, being promoted to full professor in 1989. Since 1996, he has been a professor of English and American literature and language at Harvard University.\\"Swimming in Words\\", Harvard Gazette His first wife was Barbara Kassel, a painter and teacher of painting. Sacks married Pulitzer- prize winning poet Jorie Graham in 2000. In 1999, during a residency at Marfa, Texas, Sacks began painting over photographs using thick white acrylic. Although he had been making small scale paintings in notebooks for many years, which he had chosen to keep private, this led to an interest in working on canvas and a decision to exhibit. He now shows his work in New York and around the world.Photographs and discussion of Sacks's artworks , Galerie piece unique  Art  Sacks' first two solo shows were in Paris, at Galerie Pi√®ce Unique, in 2004 and 2007. The first U.S. solo show in 2009 of his finely textured paintings at Paul Rodgers/9W Gallery in New York City received a review in Artforum (November 2009) by Rosalind Krauss. Following that show, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston acquired large triptychs. In 2010, the Houston Museum of Fine Arts acquired another triptych from an exhibition at the Wade Wilson Gallery. A show of \\"New Paintings\\" at Paul Rogers/9W Gallery from October 2012 to January 2013 elicited considerable critical reaction. In 2014 while represented by the Robert Miller Gallery he exhibited show of large scale works, the Aftermath Series. The show featured a catalogue by Christopher Bedford. Besides the introduction of stronger color in works focused around Mandela and Gandhi, the show also revealed a new emphasis on works on paper. In February 2015 the Ivorypress Gallery in Madrid exhibited 66 works on cardboard--\\"pages\\" of a book titled \\"The Kafka Series.\\" In these, wherever typed and handwritten text appeared, it was mostly drawn from Kafka's The Trial. Many of those paintings are on cardboard taken from used and labeled FedEx boxes. Sacks was until recently represented by the Marlborough Gallery, New York. An April 2017 solo show, Peter Sacks: New Works featured his Township Series and was accompanied by a catalogue introduced by Sebastian Smee. A subsequent show, Peter Sacks: Migrations, at Marlborough Fine Art, London in 2018, featured a new body of work and an essay introduction to the catalogue by Paul Keegan. In March 2019 a show of new works titled ‚ÄúRepair‚Äù was exhibited at Marlborough Gallery, New York with a catalogue by Leora-Maltz Leca. Of his work, Sacks has said, \\"I see my paintings as a cross between cave paintings, medieval frescoes, illuminated manuscripts, and late 20th-century abstract paintings....The show is about survival. It is about what endures.\\" A profile in The New Yorker Magazine in April 2019, \\"An Artist's Archeology of the Mind\\" examined his practice and the new work. He is currently represented by Sperone Westwater Gallery in NYC.  Poetry  The Library Journal, reviewing In These Mountains, said, \\"This first volume of poetry by a South African living in America is a quiet, understated, and complex work, ranging in subject from travel to homelessness; in feeling, from celebrations of beauty to painful recollection. Weaving together myth, memory, and history to narrate the fate of South African Bushmen, the long title poem expresses Sacks's complex feelings‚Äîsorrow, outrage, loss toward his homeland. Sacks is a visual poet ‚Äì an image maker rather than an abstract or discursive one ‚Äì and his images, like his feelings about South Africa, are double-edged.‚Äù Regarding Promised Lands, J.M. Coetzee described Peter Sacks as \\"a poet whose sense of history lies deep in his bones.\\" Others have praised his ability to communicate passion, pain, and the desire for redress, side by side with submission to the fact of mortality. Natal Command chronicles the poet's despair as he watches his father die and his fatherland change. The figure of the poet as swimmer and runner, of sensual man as natural athlete, is central to the book. O Wheel is a millennial collection of poems ‚Äì some of them masquerading as diary notes ‚Äì celebrating the beauty of the American West and the poet's love of his African home. The work also looks back at a century of unprecedented violence and the wrenching death of his father. In \\"Two Mountains,\\" the poet, recognising himself as Isaac at the place of sacrifice, becomes the invoked Muse. Powell's Books described O Wheel as \\"a book of amazing delicacy, intricacy, and formal beauty that reveals terrifying truths. Its backdrop is an edgy mix of the intense violence of South Africa's recent history, the personal struggles of the human soul for the rights to speak freely and to experience justice, and the expanse of the American literary landscape. Peter Sacks employs a variety of poetic styles and approaches that break new ground formally as well as thematically. With a vision that is at once personal and public, he contends with nihilism and extracts hope from even the most barbaric aspects of human nature. O Wheel offers sensitive and striking poems that menace, overwhelm, entice, provoke, and deeply move the reader.\\" Sacks' relationship with Jorie Graham was briefly the subject of controversy in the poetry community when the website Foetry.com revealedFoetry.com archive Foetry page on Jorie Graham that she judged the University of Georgia Contemporary Poetry series contest that selected Sacks's \\"O Wheel\\" as the first-place winner. Although contest administrator Bin Ramke refused to name the judge who had selected Sacks's poems, the allegation was shown to be correct when documents were released following a Georgia Open Records Act request. Although (according to the Los Angeles Times) Graham had not yet arrived at Harvard or married Sacks when the prize was awarded, she did not deny that she and Sacks knew each other at the time of the contest, and said that she felt awkward enough about it to ask series editor Ramke to make the call. About his 2003 book Necessity Sacks said, \\"The poems make and record an unavoidable but potentially self-clarifying quest in the face of injustice, atrocity, beauty.\\"Program announcement , Folger Shakespeare Library  Books and awards  Peter Sacks has published five books of poetry: In These Mountains (Macmillan 1986), Promised Lands (Penguin Books 1990), Natal Command (University of Chicago 1997), O Wheel (University of Georgia 2000), and Necessity (W.W. Norton 2002). Individual poems by Sacks have appeared in The New Yorker, The New Republic, Boulevard, The Paris Review, and other publications. He is also the author of The English Elegy: Studies in the Genre from Spencer to Yeats (Johns Hopkins University 1985) and an art historical study, Woody Gwynn: An Approach to the Landscape (Texas Tech University 1993).

Development In 2008 the trust established a subsidiary company, Healthcare Facilities Management Services Ltd, to run two new health centres in Bracknell and Reading. The intention was to achieve VAT benefits, as well as pay bill savings, by recruiting new staff on less expensive non-NHS contracts. VAT benefits arise because NHS trusts can only claim VAT back on a small subset of goods and services they buy. The Value Added Tax Act 1994 provides a mechanism through which NHS trusts can qualify for refunds on contracted out services. The trust's plans to build a pre-operative assessment block in Reading were approved by Reading Borough Council in March 2015 but councillors complained that the car parking site was \\"abominably managed\\". In 2020 the trust made a deal with Babylon Health to use their Ask A&E; triage tool for a year. A longer-term partnership is under consideration. Performance Four-hour target in the emergency department quarterly figures from NHS England Data from https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical- work-areas/ae-waiting-times-and-activity/ The Trust established a Hospital at Home service in 2015. Suitable patients are taken home, where a nurse will agree a care plan tailored to their condition.

In the End of Life Care Audit - Dying in Hospital carried out by the Royal College of Physicians in 2016, the Trust did well, with scores between 82% and 96% across the five indicators, while the national average was between 56% and 84%.

The game is a remake of the 1988 arcade game Altered Beast. While the gameplay still involves the main character transforming into different kinds of beasts like in the original, the story, characters and setting are completely different, along with notable gameplay additions. The game was released in Europe and Japan in 2005, but was cancelled for North America. Unlike the original Altered Beast which is set in Ancient Greece, the game features a modern setting unconnected to the previous installments. Plot The story follows a man called Luke Custer who is a \\"Genome-Cyborg\\", a human whose DNA and other genetic make-up has been artificially altered by micro-chips containing the genetic make-up of other creatures to transform him into an anthropomorphic beast. After surviving a helicopter crash, Luke loses his memory and sets off to learn about the truth behind his past and the Genome-Cyborgs memory his is back. Gameplay Screenshot of gameplay in Luke's werewolf form. The player controls Luke Custer in a third-person perspective as they battle through multiple enemies in close combat to reach the next objective, utilizing the ability to transform into different beasts, each with somewhat of their own element, for a certain amount of time. Unlike the original game, the player can transform in and out of their beast form at will when available. Initially from the start Luke can transform into a werewolf. Further into the game, he finds more Genome-Cyborg DNA chips allowing him to change into even more different kinds of beasts including a Merman, a Garuda, a Wendigo, a Minotaur and a Dragon. While each beast has their own different sets of attacks, they also have abilities that are essential for overcoming obstacles, puzzles and boss fights that hinder progression. Upon finishing the game, a number of other modes are unlocked including time trial boss fights and a challenge mode that can also unlock further beast forms including a White Weretiger, a Grizzly Bear and an alien-clone U.W.H. Unidentified Weightless Human. Reception The game received mixed reviews with an average critic score of 53/100 at Metacritic.Project Altered Beast at Metacritic VideoGamer said \\"The name will probably attract a number of fans of the original game, and they may get the most out of what is an average title. For those who do not base their purchases on nostalgia, look elsewhere.\\" ScrewAttack named Altered Beast as the 10th worst game on their Top 10 Worst 2D to 3D games.

The story revolves around the Croatian Usta≈°e concentration camp named The Ninth Circle, based on the infamous Jasenovac concentration camp. It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. It was also entered into the 1960 Cannes Film Festival. Plot In order to save Ruth, a Jewish girl, from the Nazis and their collaborators, a Croatian family arranges for her to marry their young son, Ivo. The young man, despite understanding the necessity of this arrangement, is unhappy with this sudden end to his careless youth and at first seems to dislike the girl, dismissing her as \\"a mere child\\" and continuing to go out with his best friend Magda, who he is also romantically interested in. Magda, who is aware of his marriage, quickly seeks to distance herself from his advances, and when a drunk Ivo calls her to his bachelor party, resulting in a highly uncomfortable situation for her, their prospective relationship ends. Angered by this, Ivo has an emotional outbreak upon returning home, causing Ruth to run out into the dark streets, where she attempts to deliberately expose herself to a passing patrol, only to be saved at the last second by Ivo's father. Ivo himself comes to the realization that his behaviour to this point has not only been reckless and selfish, but also dangerous, displaying a high degree of ignorance regarding the true severity of the situation. Following this epiphany, he soon comes to form a closer emotional relationship with his wife, spending time with her and even taking her out to a park, despite Jews not being allowed to do this. Things take a turn for the worse, however, when a member of the Usta≈°e who has previously lived in the same house as Ruth recognizes and publicly humiliates her by forcing her to clean his shoes. The situation is only de-escalated when Zvonko, one of Ivo's classmates who has also joined the Usta≈°e, notices him and tells the man to let them go. Zvonko later bullies Ivo in class by marking his coat with the letter ≈Ω, which stands for ≈Ωidovi, the Croatian word for Jew. When Ruth sees this, she is terrified, and Ivo tries to calm her down by marking several objects in the room around them with the same symbol, calling it \\"just a letter\\". He also gives her a miniature park to make up for her not being able to go there anymore. During a bomb alert, the streets are deserted, and Ruth uses this opportunity to go out on her own and enjoy a rare moment of freedom and levity. Her joy soon turns to ashes, however, as she sees her father's name on a bulletin board, indicating that he was hanged, which causes her to break down crying. The alarm ends and people return to the streets, and when an officer notices Ruth, he asks her for her last name, which she gives as Alakalaj, despite her legal last name now being Vojnoviƒá. He then proceeds to restrain her. Ivo, who unsuccessfully went out to look for her, fears the worst, and, against the pleas of his parents, decides to sneak into the local concentration camp. He asks several inmates before a woman points out the possibility of Ruth being held in the infamous Ninth Circle, which she also refers to as \\"harem\\". Ivo, now moving closer to the camp's centre, encounters his former friend Zvonko, who works as a guard there and cynically attempts to paint life in the camp in a positive light. They come across a group of children with a man talking them into entering a car, but when the doors close, Ivo horrifiedly notices a gas cylinder labelled with a skull, realizing that the car is in fact a gas van. As they approach the Ninth Circle, Zvonko tells Ivo that all the women there are due to be murdered this very night, adding that he might have \\"one last go\\" at Ruth before that, which causes Ivo to knock him unconscious or possibly kill him. When he then enters the central building, he bears witness to the grotesque spectacle going on inside‚Äî‚Äîcheerful music is playing and men and women are dancing, but the men are Usta≈°e officers who cruelly make a point to step on the terrified women's unclothed feet. Ivo sees Ruth, and as the women are rushed out, he grabs her and flees to hide in an empty guard tower, where they share a moment of intimacy. As the power on the barbed wire surrounding the area is said to be switched off at midnight to remove the dead bodies from it, they decide to wait until then, planning to use this short period of time to escape. When the hour finally arrives, however, Ruth, who climbed after Ivo and still wears no shoes, finds herself unable to pass the fence, and Ivo, who had already reached the other side and could have saved his life very easily, rather decides to stay with her. The film ends with a close-up shot of a light being turned back on, implying that both Ruth and Ivo were killed. Critical reception The Ninth Circle was nominated for the Golden Palm in Cannes and for an Oscar for best foreign language film. The film was also released in more than 30 countries, including the U.S., the Soviet Union, France, Italy, Great Britain, Germany, Israel, Argentina, Australia, and Japan. The Croatian Film Association's database describes The Ninth Circle as \\"the most beautiful and the most moving war melodrama of Croatian cinema\\". In 1999, a poll of Croatian film critics found it to be one of the best Croatian films ever made. Contemporary commentator Jurica Paviƒçiƒá calls The Ninth Circle \\"the most important Croatian film about the Holocaust\\", pointing out that it represents the first acknowledgement of the Jasenovac camp in all of Croatian cinema. However, he also calls the film \\"old-fashionedly expressive\\", noting that from a modern perspective, the viewing experience seems \\"archaic\\", especially in regards to aspects like shot composition and its inappropriately ostentatious soundtrack. The film's position as a landmark in Balkan cinema history remains undisputed.

He later became a coach, manager and scout. Playing career Born in Gateshead, Mallett was spotted playing for the Dunston Colliery works team by a London scout, and was signed at the age of seventeen by Charlton Athletic to serve his apprenticeship under manager Jimmy Seed. He had not made any first team appearances before Charlton (then in the First Division) loaned him to Third Division South team Queens Park Rangers to gain experience in April 1937. He remained at QPR until May 1938, making 31 appearances before returning to Charlton, where he appeared twice in the 1938‚Äì39 season. In February 1939 Rangers persuaded Charlton to sell him; he was becoming a first-team regular at QPR before his career was interrupted by conscription into the RAF in World War II. During the war he guested for Fulham and West Ham, returning to QPR after the cessation of hostilities. In February 1947 Bill Dodgin signed him for Southampton for a club record ¬£5000. Although now aged 31, Mallett proved to be a bargain purchase ‚Äì he was \\"a strong link between the defence and attack, and was particularly sound in his positional play.\\" He made his debut away to Plymouth Argyle on 1 March 1947, scoring one of Saints' goals and making the other in a 3‚Äì2 defeat. He soon became the team's captain and had \\"forthright views on how the game should be played\\". Teammate Alf Ramsey described him as \\"having one of the finest of all soccer brains\\".Quoted in ibid When Dodgin left the Saints in August 1949 to be replaced by Sid Cann, Mallett became restless and in January 1950 he put in a transfer request in the hope of receiving a coaching position. The board persuaded him to stay and he remained loyal to Southampton, playing regularly until his last game, away to Nottingham Forest on 29 April 1953. During his Southampton career he made 223 appearances, scoring three goals. Coaching career In July 1953, now aged 37, he moved on to Leyton Orient as player-coach, where he was re-united with former QPR teammate Alec Stock. In 1959, he was reserve team coach at Nottingham Forest under Billy Walker and then Andy Beattie, where he brought on a succession of young players, including Ian Storey-Moore and David Pleat. In June 1964 he joined Birmingham City as coach, and a month later accepted the vacant managerial position. Although he was a proven technical coach with sound judgment of a player ‚Äì he signed Geoff Vowden and Ron WylieMatthews, Complete Record, pp. 131, 136. and gave Malcolm Page his debut ‚Äì under his management Birmingham won only 13 out of 64 matchesMatthews, Complete Record, pp. 200‚Äì01. and were relegated from the First Division. He remained at the club as assistant manager under Stan Cullis from December 1965 to 1970. When Cullis retired, Mallett went on to manage Panionios and coach at Apollon in the Greek Super League. From 1975 he coached under Gordon Bradley at New York Cosmos in the NASL where he worked with players such as Pel√©, Johan Cruyff and Franz Beckenbauer, rejoining Bradley at the Washington Diplomats in 1978, and later coached at San Jose Earthquakes. He also scouted for former club Southampton. Personal life He was married to Bertha, whom he first met whilst at Charlton Athletic. They had three sons, Alan, Brian and Francis, and one daughter Julia. Mallett died at his home in Hastings on 8 February 2004 with his family around him.

The same year, Nicholas Negroponte, then the laboratory chairman of Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Media Lab, joined the company as a non-executive director. In 2002, Velti gained Vodafone as a customer. By the end of that year, the company had reached 35 employees. After a 2006 initial public offering on the London Stock Exchange's AIM Market, Velti further expanded its U.S. operations with the opening of an office in New York. A San Francisco office was created the following year. Velti was one of the 10-best performing IPOs in London Stock Exchange's AIM in 2007 http://www.velti.info/press_release/pdfs/Velti%20among%20the%20ten%20best%20performing%20IPOs%20on%20the%20London%20Stock%20Exchange%20June%2021%202007.pdf Beginning in 2007, Velti entered into a series of joint ventures and partnerships with the Interpublic Group to create Ansible, a mobile marketing joint venture. In 2008, Velti opened a new office in Beijing and made an investment in CASEE. In India, Velti partnered with HT Media Limited, India's second-largest media group, on a mobile marketing joint venture called HT Mobile Solutions. 2008 also saw the opening of a new Velti office in Moscow. In 2009, Velti announced the acquisition of Ad Infuse, a provider of personalized mobile advertising in the U.S. increasing the company's headcount to more than 400, including more than 200 technology staff. In 2010, the company announced the acquisition of Mobclix,. A second 2010 acquisition added Media Cannon, a developer of mobile advertising tools and technology. By the end of 2010, Velti had grown to more than 500 employees in 30 countries. In January, 2011, Velti completed an initial public offering of 12 million common stock shares on NASDAQ under the trading symbol VELT. The IPO raised approximately $150 million, according to ROAMdata (Boston-based subsidiary of Ingenico). In September 2011, Velti acquired Air2Web Inc a mobile customer relationship management technology company based in Atlanta for $19 million. Velti demonstrated a dramatic revenue growth following its London and NASDAQ listings. Its revenues grew from $90m in 2009 to $116m in 2010 to $189m in 2011 to $270m in 2012.http://www.velti.com/press_release/mar-12-12.php  Sale to Blackstone and Delisting from Nasdaq  In late summer 2013, Velti was forced to write down nearly $111 million of AR, reducing its headcount by almost 20% and placing Mobclix on the chopping block to raise spare cash. These actions led to a severe stock drop. On November 4, 2013, Velti sold its assets to GSO, the credit division of Blackstone. The US subsidiary asset sale was done under chapter 11, while the all subsidiary (including the US) and the parent company continued normal operations. On December 16, 2013, Velti voluntarily de-listed from the Nasdaq market in order to complete the sale of assets to Blackstone: \\"The voluntary decision to delist from NASDAQ was taken following the Company's review of several factors, including its previously disclosed noncompliance with the minimum bid price requirements of NASDAQ..\\" http://investors.velti.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=809980 Velti shares are now traded on the OTC market.http://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/VELTF/quote Velti currently operates in 10 countries, is profitable and its main customers include Vodafone, T-Mobile, Orange, Movistar, Airtel, Pepsico, MBC and Nestle.http://www.velti.com/mobilemarketingoperator.php Velti does not provide financial statements since 2013.http://www.velti.com/20141105170152763.pdf References Mass media companies of the United States ","title":"Velti"},{"id":"14380819","text":"El Ancer is a district in Jijel Province, Algeria.

James (n√©e V. Kennedy) is a magician from the city of Chennai, in South India. He is best known for his famous guerrilla advertising campaign (inspired by Brooke Bond painted wagonsArticle on Ergo), in which the phrase \\"P.

James adopted his stage name after his grandfather, also a performing magician. Sample of the infamous advert Chennai is a city where the wall space is tightly controlled and shared by competing political parties. It is also dominated by advertisements for commercial goods and services. Despite this, James has achieved a high penetration with his marketing campaign, at a low cost. He has, however, spent a total of 14 years painting, setting out by himself at 9:30 PM. He uses a mixture of black oxide and Fevicol for the paint, as this is cheap, but also survives through rain. James' technique has been called naive by some observers.Article on James Indeed, the advertising campaign has not resulted in particularly high market share, although James attributes this to the increasing movement of magic from the stage to the television screen. James' campaign has spawned several imitators, notably A-Z entertainment, which adopts a similar font and style of placement, though at a lower concentration. It is not known what link, if any, exists between the various organizations. It is also unknown what relationship James has with the nationally famous P.C.Sorkar, or with rising local talent, such as JMK Disco Raja. In late 2007, James was requested by the Commissioner of Police to abstain from his sign-painting. This is the culmination of various efforts by authorities to put an end to James' advertising campaign.

Eli can be a masculine given name of Hebrew origin, from Biblical \\"ascent\\", spelled with the Hebrew letter ayin in the beginning, the name of Eli, the high priest in the Books of Samuel. It came to be used as a given name among the Puritans in the 17th century and was by them taken to the American colonies.Royal Ralph Hinman,A catalogue of the names of the first Puritan settlers of the colony of Connecticut, 1846, p. 169 mentions one Eli Bush, born 1741. David Pickering, The Penguin Book of Baby Names, Penguin, 2009. See also babynamespedia.com. Eli may alternatively be an unrelated abbreviation of Hebrew names such as Elijah, Elisha, Eliezer, Elimelech, etc., all containing the element , meaning \\"my god\\" and spelled with the Hebrew letter aleph in the beginning. El is the name of a Semitic deity that is used in the Bible as a name for the god of the Israelites, and -i is the suffix for the genitive form (\\"mine\\"). Eli is sometimes also used as a short form for feminine names, biblical or not, such as Elizabeth and Eliana. In the United States, the popularity of the given name Eli was hovering around rank 200 in the 1880s. It declined gradually during the late 19th and early-to-mid 20th centuries, falling below rank 700 in 1964. In a significant revival of the name's popularity in the early 1970s, it bounced back above rank 400 in 1976.

It is committed to global missions and has affiliate congregations in Kenya, Uganda, Myanmar, Pakistan, Indonesia, Australia and the Philippines. Established in 1990, the church is led by founder and senior pastor Rev. Yang Tuck Yoong. History Cornerstone Community Church, previously known as Bedok Christian Centre, was established in 1990 under the umbrella of the Anglican Church in Singapore. On January 1, 1994, it was renamed Cornerstone Community Church to better reflect the growing diversity of the congregation. On June 2, 1995, CSCC became an independent Charismatic church to further facilitate the spiritual calling of the parishioners. In mid-2000, the church became officially affiliated with Zion Ministerial Fellowship Inc., a ministerial fellowship based in Waverly, New York, United States. Over the years, Cornerstone Community Church has grown to more than 5,000 members comprising ten congregations of various nationalities and languages. It has also set up bible schools and planted over a 100 churches in 18 different countries. This includes Generations, their youth service led by Pastor Sng Peh Han. In 2012, CSCC had the privilege of redeeming the iconic Bible College of Wales and the Pisgah Chapel in Swansea, Wales, an institution that intercessor, Rees Howells established in 1927. Cell Groups Cell groups are a fundamental part of Cornerstone Community Church. The purpose of the cell groups is to be a setting for relational connectedness where the love of Christ is experienced in a personal way through friendship, care, encouragement, and expressions of love and kindness. It is also a place to grow, where every believer can develop and use their God-given abilities to help others and to engage in body ministry in the most powerful way. Missions Cornerstone Community Church believes it has been called by God to be a house of prayer and to fulfil the Great Commission. Since its inception, the church has dispatched many teams overseas to proclaim the gospel. Today, CSCC has church plants in almost a dozen countries. Controversies Homosexuality Rev. Yang was in the news after an article entitled \\"Gay Backlash\\" was published in The Straits Times on July 23, 2003.‚ÄùGay Backlash‚Äù, M. Nirmala, The Straits Times, 2003-07-23 View of church's signage from across East Coast Road. The article summarised the different views of Christian organisations in Singapore regarding the remarks made by then-Singaporean Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong, in which he announced the government's openness to the employment of homosexuals, despite homosexual acts still being illegal in Singapore. The article reported that Rev. Yang, together with a group of Christians, voluntary organisations and professions, met to discuss a strategy and plan of action for Christians to tackle what they termed as a \\"volatile situation.\\" In September 2003, Rev. Yang issued a statement to Time magazine whereby he accused the American publication of glamourizing an illegal and condemned lifestyle in an article which reviewed the gay scene in Singapore. He added that the people of Singapore have spoken up against the subject. No attestation, however, was provided by Rev. Yang with regard to this claim. On February 24, 2008, Rev. Yang gave a sermon entitled \\"The Sin of Sodom\\" in which he called homosexuality an abomination. He argued that homosexuality is a spirit that is yet to prevail in Singapore because of official legislation, public opinion and conscience. He persuaded churches to stand up and oppose this \\"spirit,\\" before Singapore is sent to the abyss in the same manner as Sodom. He also encouraged churches to be \\"bold\\" and \\"courageous,\\" and to \\"take a stand.\\" He lamented that a church that has lost the ability to influence and lobby society would be useless. Myanmar floods 2008 In May 2008, Rev. Yang commented in an article published in The Christian Post that he understood the 2008 Myanmar floods, caused by Cyclone Nargis, to be the \\"Hand of God‚Äù to teach the nations righteousness. Contrary to published sources, Rev. Yang encouraged his readers to view the floods as a warning that the end ‚Äúdraweth nigh‚Äù.

The dam supports a hydroelectric power facility with a capacity. The facility is located about downstream from the Guri Dam belonging to the \\"Central Hidroel√©ctrica Sim√≥n Bol√≠var\\" and about from where the Caroni and Orinoco rivers meet at Ciudad Guayana.Official site of EDELCA and the Caruachi Project , published 2007, accessed 2007-11-23  The dam  The first of the Kaplan turbine-generators General Electric supplied for the project began commercial operation in April 2003; the 12th and final unit entered service on February 28, 2006, and entered into formal/fully commercial operation on 31 March 2006, when the project was officially inaugurated. The total installed capacity is 2,160 MW and the power plant will produce about 12 TW¬∑h annually. This project is formed jointly with the Central Hidroel√©ctrica Sim√≥n Bol√≠var in Guri, Antonio Jos√© de Sucre in Macagua and Manuel Piar in Tocoma (under construction), the development of Lower Caron√≠ River hydroelectric resources and one of the world's largest hydro projects now in construction, that, when completed, EDELCA (Electrificaci√≥n del Caron√≠ CA) claims will save Venezuela the equivalent of 750,000 barrels of oil per day, compared to 300,000 currently.  Design and construction  The contract for the design, supply and installation of the main electro-mechanical equipment was awarded to a consortium of Kvaerner of Norway, GE Energy of the USA, and Elin Transformatoren GmbH of Austria. Major work began on the project in 1998. Following GE's acquisition of Kvaerner's hydro business in 1999, over 90% of the Caruachi contract was carried out by GE Hydro, including all aspects of the design, supply and installation of the turbines, generators, governors, exciters and cranes. A total of 12 Kaplan turbine-generator units, each capable of a power output of 180 MW, were supplied to the project. ABB of Switzerland won three contracts to provide the power transmission system for the project. A 400 kV substation and four related 400 kV transmission lines connect the plant with the country's transmission network. Alstom Power was awarded the contract for distributed control system and SCADA, and small electrical auxiliaries like UPS equipments and DC distribution boards. The original GE Hydro and Elin contracts were, through several mergers and acquisitions, transferred to the 2005-created Andritz Hydro of Austria. While the original Alstom contract was in 2014 inherited by a new GE Renewable Energy entity.

Background Perhaps the group's most famous recording is Musique de la Gr√®ce Antique (Music of Ancient Greece), in which they performed ancient Greek music carefully taken from scattered extant fragments of papyrus. Performing the ancient compositions also meant they had to reconstruct an arsenal of ancient instruments. This ancient music was an important aspect of the group's live performances during a series of acclaimed international tours. Another well-known recording by the group is their 1976 disc Musique Arabo-Andalouse, which delves into the Hispanic-Moslem music of southern Spain and is credited with creating new interest in the genre.

In common usage, \\"World Wide Web\\" refers primarily to a web of discrete information objects readable by human beings, with functional linkages provided between them by human-created hyperlinks. Next-generation Web 3.0 information designs go beyond the discrete web pages of previous generations by emphasizing the metadata which describe information objects like web pages and attribute the relationships that conceptually or semantically link the information objects to each other. Additionally, Web 3.0 technologies and designs enable the organization of entirely new kinds of human- and machine-created data objects. An important related concept that overlaps with Giant Global Graph without fully encompassing it is that of the Semantic Web. Social networking services are one of the earliest and best- known examples of this distinction. In a Social Network, the information about relationships between people, and the kinds of data objects those people share, is at least as important as the data objects themselves. Plus, participants in a Social Network create new kinds of data that did not exist on the web before, such as their Likes for other people's comments and content. Currently, these new kinds of data are primarily structured and mediated by the proprietary systems of companies like Facebook. In the ideal future of the decentralized Giant Global Graph or Semantic Web, such information would be structured in such a way that it could be readable by many different systems and dynamically organized into many different user- readable formats. The GGG concept also relates to the Decentralization of Internet Information, whereby properly-formatted semantic web data objects can be organized and their relationships discerned by any computer on the Internet, rather than solely being organized by large centralized systems such as Facebook and Google. For instance, people using the FOAF protocol to organize information on websites or other Internet nodes can define and interact with their social networks without necessarily requiring the intervention of centralized systems like Facebook. Crucially, where the term Web 3.0 refers to a suite of technologies and to a particular phase in the development of the web, the term Giant Global Graph is intended to refer more generally to the total environment of information that will be generated and sustained through the implementation of these technologies. This environment will be a qualitatively different one than that which existed before the development of these technologies. As of 2017, anticipated progress toward a pervasive semantic web has been side-tracked by the widespread application of machine learning technologies to process existing, unstructured data and content, and that it is no longer clear whether a Web 3.0 epoch will materialize as originally envisioned.  History  The term Giant Global Graph was notably used the first time by the inventor of the World Wide Web, Tim Berners-Lee, on his blog. Tim Berners-Lee thinks about the social network itself that is inside and between social-network Web sites such as Facebook. He assumes that people can use the word \\"Graph\\" to distinguish these from the \\"Web\\". Then he says that, although he called this graph the Semantic Web, maybe it should have been called the \\"Giant Global Graph\\". \\"GGG\\" has been used several times by Berners-Lee and by others in other blogs. GGG may be described as the content plus pointers of the WWW transitioning to content plus pointers plus relationships plus descriptions. Significantly, the Giant Global Graph concept seems to have been a significant input in Facebook's concept and name for their \\"Open Graph\\" project and protocol, which is their effort to spread their approach to social networking beyond the bounds of the Facebook website, allowing a broader network or \\"graph\\" of connections between Facebook users, and between Facebook users and the Internet data objects which interest them.

The original application of the magnetic horn was in the context of neutrino physics, where beams of pions have to be tightly focused. When the pions then decay into muons and neutrinos or antineutrinos, an equally well-focused neutrino beam is obtained.  Description  Production of a neutrino beam generally involves directing protons onto a fixed target of solid material. The protons interact strongly with the nuclei in the target, producing a variety of secondary hadrons. The proton beam energy and target material are chosen so that these hadrons are mostly pions and kaons. Both of these particles' decays produce neutrinos. However, without a neutrino horn, the resulting neutrino beam is very wide, both geometrically and in energy spread. This is because the secondary particles are produced at a variety of angles and energies and then when they decay, the neutrinos are again produced at a variety of angles and energies. The neutrinos themselves cannot be focused with electric or magnetic fields because they are electrically neutral. Instead, one or more magnetic horns can be used to focus the secondary particles. The shape of the horn and strength of the magnetic field can be tuned to select a range of particle energies that are to be best focused. In this way, the resulting neutrino beam is both geometrically focused and given a chosen range of energies. Note however that the decays of the secondary hadrons still impart some random direction to the neutrinos, so the beam will always spread to some degree no matter how well the horn works.  Notable uses  * The NuMI beam, used by the MINOS, NOŒΩA and MINERŒΩA experiments, uses 2 magnetic horns to produce a 3GeV muon neutrino beam.https://indico.in2p3.fr/event/10819/session/0/contribution/46/material/slides/0.pdf * The Gargamelle bubble chamber, in which the first neutral current reactions were observed, used a 20GeV muon anti-neutrino beam focused by a single horn.

The musical show was made by TWW (Television Wales and the West) in Cardiff‚Äôs Pontcanna studios, and was designed to celebrate Wales within Wales and beyond.  Land of Song  During its six-year run, Gwlad y Gan, or 'Land of Song', offered a Sunday evening entertainment based on Welsh music and song led by the baritone Ivor Emmanuel, who was already well known from his success in West End musicals on the London stage. Around Emmanuel were gathered a children‚Äôs chorus, an adult chorus and, from its ranks, a select group of male singers ‚Äì Denis Griffiths, Bryn Williams, John Willams and Harry Price ‚Äì who accompanied Emmanuel in a variety of set-pieces. Griffiths also sang regular solos, and was often paired in duet with the young soprano Sian Hopkins. The popularity of the show - regularly playing to ten million viewers at its peak - led to the release of two Land of Song records (Delys√© EDPs 209 and 210), made in London in 1960 by the record producer Isabella Wallich. They sold very well and proved the first \\"big hit\\" for Wallich's fledgling Delys√© label, reaching number 13 in the popular music charts of 1961.Isabella Wallich, autobiography Recording My Life (London; Sanctuary, 2001), pp.159-161  Life and career  Born and educated in Aberystwyth in Ceredigion, where he trained as an engineer, Denis Griffiths spent the war years in London, working for the General Electric Company in Wembley making precision parts for armaments as part of the war effort. While there he began his public singing career, performing in oratorios and other concerts. Moving back to Wales at the end of the war, he continued to pursue singing opportunities. Having taken singing lessons while in London, he now enrolled at the Cardiff College of Music (now the Royal Welsh College of Music & Drama) and, towards the end of 1947, successfully auditioned for the original BBC Welsh Chorus, founded by the BBC's Director of Music in Wales, Idris Lewis. The new Chorus, conducted by Arwel Hughes, was established to complement the BBC Welsh Orchestra which was reformed after the war, in 1946, at the instigation of Sir Adrian Boult. Both were cornerstones of the BBC's renewed commitment in the post-war years to the encouragement and promotion of sung excellence through its broadcasts to Wales and the UK.Rowland Lucas, The Voice of Nation: A Concise Account of the BBC in Wales 1923-1973 (Llandysul: Gomer; 1981)  Singing on the Radio  Griffiths's membership of the new BBC Welsh Chorus led rapidly to other broadcast work which included solo appearances in programmes for the BBC Light Programme such as Footlight Favourites and Memories Live Longer than Dreams, and for the BBC Welsh Home Service in musical and cultural anthologies such as Welsh Magazine, Their Songs and Ours, Welsh Song Recital, Country Magazine, Rhythm Rendezvous, and Sing Lads Sing. As a native Welsh speaker he was also in demand at the BBC as a singer in a variety of Welsh language musical broadcasts such as Hob Y Deri Dando, Dechrau‚Äôr Dydd and Bore Da. His radio work during the 1950s included appearances as a soloist with popular singing groups of the time such as the Garth Players and he was, for a time, a member of the Lyrian Singers. He performed live broadcast recitals of light songs and favourite numbers from the shows, together with work by contemporary Welsh composers such as Mansel Thomas and Idris Lewis himself. His lyric style singled him out as a favoured soloist for specialised music programmes. In July 1953, for example, he sang in a tribute to a well-loved songwriter: Edward German ‚Äì A Man and his Music was broadcast both on the BBC Welsh Home Service and on the General Overseas Service of the BBC. He also sang for the BBC Light Programme's Woman's Hour. From 1951 onwards, he appeared in a variety of Welsh language educational broadcasts, including First Stages in Welsh and Second Stages in Welsh, and from 1957 became the resident tenor in the long-running educational radio series Sain Cerdd a Chan (‚ÄòSound Story and Song‚Äô). Typically this programme brought together an intimate group of musicians (a singer, a pianist and, for example, a percussionist and glockenspiel player) to demonstrate songs in Welsh as an aid for school children to learn the language and to learn something about tonic sol fa and music-making in general. By the mid-1950s, he was also appearing as a member of the BBC Welsh Singers (also known as the BBC Octet), a singing group retained by the BBC specifically to perform the music in its weekly religious broadcasts which included services and other meditative programmes such as Lighten Our Darkness. Consisting of two sopranos, two altos, two tenors and two basses, the typical character of the octet's work is reflected in an early notice seen in the BBC Annual Report: \\"The BBC Welsh Singers gave notable performances of a number of Bach cantatas sung in Welsh. Their quiet, nostalgic programmes of Welsh part-songs of the nineteenth century were especially popular.\\"A copy of BBC Annual Accounts and Report 1946-7 is held at the BBC‚Äôs Written Archive at Caversham, Berkshire. From 1964 Griffiths was the official secretary of the octet, but in 1957 it was his membership of that group that led directly to his involvement in TV's Land of Song. Through founder octet member and Cardiff music teacher Clifford Bunford, the BBC singers provided the core of the adult chorus recruited by ITV's music director Norman Whitehead for TWW's new Welsh musical show.Conversation with Cliff Bunford recorded at his home in Cardiff by Peter Griffiths on 29 December 2002  After Land of Song  When Land of Song ended in 1964, Griffiths continued to sing for TWW. He was a regular tenor soloist on TV shows such as Y Caban Pren (‚ÄòThe Wood Cabin‚Äô or 'Log Cabin'), which was designed to continue the popular formula of well-loved musical numbers performed in a rustic setting.Caban Pren was renamed Sgubor Lawen ('The Jolly Cabin') when HTV won the Welsh TV franchise at TWW's expense in 1967. It is unlikely that Denis continued to feature in it as he had been given an ultimatum by the BBC to choose between working for the BBC or for independent broadcasters. But by the late 1960s he had committed himself fully to his BBC radio singing work. Outside of the BBC, Denis Griffiths was a long-standing member of the Cardiff Bach Choir (founded in 1962 by Clifford Bunford) and over many years sang tenor solos in the choir's presentations of the great oratorio works by Bach, Handel, Haydn, Mendelssohn, Stainer, Faur√© and others in halls and churches throughout South Wales and in concerts given at Llandaff Cathedral in Cardiff. Aside from his singing, he remained a skilled professional engineer, a maker of precision instruments, and throughout his musical career worked full-time for the NHS, becoming Chief Medical Physics Technician at Velindre Hospital in Whitchurch, Cardiff, where he fashioned a number of ground-breaking technical solutions to aid hospital and medical procedures. He continued singing for Sain Cerdd a Chan on BBC Radio right up until his retirement in 1984. At his death, in February 2001, he was survived by his wife of more than fifty years, Joyce, and their two sons, Huw and Peter.

There is a power metal band in Japan also named Mastermind which has no relation to the better-known American Mastermind (although oddly enough, Jens Johansson did make a guest appearance on a Mastermind Japan recording). History Mastermind was founded in 1986 when guitarist Bill Berends and his brother, drummer Rich Berends, met bassist Phil Antolino. As a power trio, they were very much in the Emerson, Lake & Palmer style, with fast and flashy playing inside anthems of considerable grandeur‚Äîexcept with guitar and guitar-synthesizer leads instead of keyboards. That year, the band played many dates on the New Jersey club circuit, and recorded a self-produced cassette, Volume One. Guitar Player Magazine columnist, producer & Shrapnel Records founder Mike Varney featured Bill in his \\"Spotlight\\" column in 1988. As a result of this exposure and the overwhelmingly positive response to their live shows, Mastermind was signed to Magna Carta, the first band the fledgling label signed. Unfortunately, early startup delays hampered their release schedule, and Mastermind was forced to turn to a small independent label ZNR Records to finally re-release Volume One on CD in December, 1990. With this release Mastermind's reputation began to grow nationally and internationally. Their second album, Mastermind Volume Two: Brainstorm, was recorded Winter 1988-Spring 1991 and released in January 1992, with an even heavier sound than the first. The 20-minute title track harkens back to ELP's \\"Tarkus\\" and has been a frequent concert highlight. Between mid-1993 and early 1994, the brothers completed their third studio recording, Tragic Symphony, released in Japan in November '94. The album was released worldwide in June 1995 by Cyclops Records/GFT in Europe and by Dutch East India Trading in North America on their in-house Prozone label. The album also was released in Korea by Jigu Records, making for total sales far exceeding any of the band's releases to date. In 1995, Mastermind opened for John Wetton's acoustic tour by playing a special unplugged acoustic show, and also opened for Joe Satriani. By early 1996, their fourth album, Until Eternity, was completed and released in Japan that June. It was released in Europe and North America in October 1996. With album sales strong and interest high, the first two Mastermind discs were re-released in Europe and Japan and the band set off to tour the globe. In 1997, Mastermind performed live headlining in Japan, played festivals in Europe, supported Rush in New Jersey, and opened for Fish (of Marillion fame) across America. In June 1997, Cyclops released a limited-edition Live in Tokyo disc (recorded earlier that year at On Air West), which quickly sold out its limited (1000 copies) edition. As 1997 wrapped up, the brothers decided it was time for a change and famed Swedish metal keyboardist Jens Johansson (ex-Yngwie Malmsteen, Stratovarius) was invited to record with the band. The band spent most of 1998 completing their album with Johansson, Excelsior!, which was released at the end of 1998. The new group debuted at Baltimore's POWERMAD 1998 festival in August. Angels of the Apocalypse, the second album featuring Johansson, brought in mezzo- soprano vocalist Lisa Bouchelle to shake things up. The album featured a version of ELP's \\"The Endless Enigma Parts 1 & II\\". More touring followed, and the album was released in 2000 by InsideOut Records. In 2001, a live album (recorded in 1999) was released on the band's own StellarVox Records label. Finally in 2005, an extended-play CD single (44 minutes) was released, featuring two tracks from forthcoming studio album plus a version of A Perfect Circle's \\"Weak & Powerless\\" and four tracks from Mastermind's extensive concert repertoire recorded live in the studio in 2005. In February 2007, after keeping up a blistering touring pace for twenty years, performing every year between 1987 and 2007 in the USA, Europe, and Japan, the Berends decided to shift gears somewhat. They started a cover band, calling themselves Berends Bros. Band (BBB), to have a little fun with their roots of blues & old school psychedelic blues rock. Recruiting blues rocker John Benussi on bass from a local Jimi Hendrix tribute act Axis they play a repertoire of favorites both old & new. The band performed live for the first time in March 2007 to great response, and have played extensively around home (New Jersey and Pennsylvania) throughout 2007. The Berends brothers have also played as The Berends/Wilson Trio (abv. BWT), a journey into the music of Cream with Ed Wilson on bass & vocals. After five years, Mastermind released the long- awaited Insomnia album in February 2010. Extensive audio and video clips of all Berends brothers bands can be found on their website.

Biography Right from his studies at the coll√®ge d'Harcourt, he had a passion for antiquities. He was particularly marked by frequent meetings with Jean- Jacques Barth√©lemy, author of Voyage d'Anarcharsis, whom he met at the home of his cousin the duc de Choiseul. Another friend was Talleyrand, with whom he participated in court intrigues and by whom he was dissuaded from taking up the religious life. In 1776, he left for Greece on board the frigate Atalante, commanded by Joseph Bernard de Chabert, marquis of Chabert, who was interested in astronomy. With painters and architects in tow, Choiseul-Gouffier thus visited the south Peloponnese, the Cyclades and other Aegean islands, then moved on to Asia Minor. The journey had also had a political goal - explaining the situation in the Aegean between the Ottoman Empire and Imperial Russia. On his return he published the first volume of his Voyage pittoresque de la Gr√®ce, which was a great success and facilitated his intellectual and political career. He became a member of the Acad√©mie des inscriptions et belles-lettres in 1782, then a member of the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise in 1783. He was ambassador to Constantinople from 1784 to 1791, taking advantage of this chance to discover Greece. In Constantinople he gathered about him a semi- formal academy where gentlemen engaged in recording the beauties and treasures of the city gathered. Chantal Grell, \\"Les ambiguit√©s du philhellenisme: L'ambassade du comte de Choiseul-Gouffier aupr√®s de la sublime porte (1784-1792)\\" Dix-huiti√®me si√®cle, 27 (1995) pp 223-235. Choiseul-Gouffier visited Athens, where he coveted the Parthenon's metopes, obtained a firman, as Elgin did later, to remove antiquities from the Acropolis, and sent to France a part of the Parthenon frieze which was two metres long, and was part of the sculpture collection he bequeathed on his death to the Louvre, where it now resides. His marble bust of Marcus Aurelius, found by the French consul Louis Fauvel in Attica in 1789, was sold in 1818; it was later acquired by the Mus√©e du Louvre, whilst an Apollo previously owned by him is now in the British Museum. The French Revolution changed the course of his life. Refusing to obey the Convention, he refused his recall to France for fear of being guillotined. His goods in France were seized and another envoy sent out to replace him. After a year spent under siege in the embassy, Choiseul Gouffier emigrated in 1792 to Russia, where he was named Director of the Academy of Arts and Imperial Public Library of Russia. Empress Catherine the Great became friends with him and gave him lands and a domain in what is now Lithuania. (His descendants lived in Lithuania until 1945 when, hunted by the Communists, the last of the Choiseul-Gouffiers fled to Switzerland and died there in 1949.) He only returned to France upon Napoleon's amnesty to exiled nobles at the start of the First Empire in 1802. Finding his friend Talleyrand, he refused to participate in the government of the Empire, and remained faithful to Louis XVIII. He published the second volume of his Voyage pittoresque de la Gr√®ce in 1809 and built himself a house imitating the Erechtheion. He was named a Minister of France and Peer of France upon the Bourbon Restoration. Excluded from the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise for having emigrated, he regained his seat in 1816. The third volume of his Voyage pittoresque de la Gr√®ce was published posthumously in 1822.  Works  He published his impressions as Voyage Pittoresque en Gr√®ce (Brussels 1782), often reprinted, and republished as late as 1842, as Voyage pittoresque dans l‚ÄôEmpire Ottomane. It presented many little known monuments, set in an idealised Greece crushed by Ottoman domination and desiring to rediscover and reawaken its liberty. This romantic vision of modern-day Greece was taken apart by several other travellers at the start of the 19th century. Like them, he suggested one should go see these sites in person to better comprehend the ancient authors, walking round sites with their texts in one's hand, \\"to feel more live the different beauties of the pictures traced by Homer, by seeing the images he had in his eyes\\" (\\"pour sentir plus vivement les beaut√©s diff√©rentes des tableaux trac√©s par Hom√®re en voyant les images qu'il avait eues sous les yeux\\"). His narrative allowed his readership to get to know previously unknown regions of Greece, such as the Cyclades. He asked his prot√©g√©, the painter Lancelot-Th√©odore Turpin de Criss√©, to produce the engravings for the second volume. His other works include a Dissertation sur Hom√®re, a m√©moire on hippodrome at Olympia, and Recherches sur l'origine du Bosphore de Thrace.

Algorithm  In the ABC model, the colony consists of three groups of bees: employed bees, onlookers and scouts. It is assumed that there is only one artificial employed bee for each food source. In other words, the number of employed bees in the colony is equal to the number of food sources around the hive. Employed bees go to their food source and come back to hive and dance on this area. The employed bee whose food source has been abandoned becomes a scout and starts to search for finding a new food source. Onlookers watch the dances of employed bees and choose food sources depending on dances. The main steps of the algorithm are given below.: * Initial food sources are produced for all employed bees * REPEAT ** Each employed bee goes to a food source in her memory and determines a closest source, then evaluates its nectar amount and dances in the hive ** Each onlooker watches the dance of employed bees and chooses one of their sources depending on the dances, and then goes to that source. After choosing a neighbour around that, she evaluates its nectar amount. ** Abandoned food sources are determined and are replaced with the new food sources discovered by scouts. ** The best food source found so far is registered. * UNTIL (requirements are met) In ABC, a population based algorithm, the position of a food source represents a possible solution to the optimization problem and the nectar amount of a food source corresponds to the quality (fitness) of the associated solution. The number of the employed bees is equal to the number of solutions in the population. At the first step, a randomly distributed initial population (food source positions) is generated. After initialization, the population is subjected to repeat the cycles of the search processes of the employed, onlooker, and scout bees, respectively. An employed bee produces a modification on the source position in her memory and discovers a new food source position. Provided that the nectar amount of the new one is higher than that of the previous source, the bee memorizes the new source position and forgets the old one. Otherwise she keeps the position of the one in her memory. After all employed bees complete the search process, they share the position information of the sources with the onlookers on the dance area. Each onlooker evaluates the nectar information taken from all employed bees and then chooses a food source depending on the nectar amounts of sources. As in the case of the employed bee, she produces a modification on the source position in her memory and checks its nectar amount. Providing that its nectar is higher than that of the previous one, the bee memorizes the new position and forgets the old one. The sources abandoned are determined and new sources are randomly produced to be replaced with the abandoned ones by artificial scouts.  Artificial bee colony algorithm  Artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm is an optimization technique that simulates the foraging behavior of honey bees, and has been successfully applied to various practical problems. ABC belongs to the group of swarm intelligence algorithms and was proposed by Karaboga in 2005. A set of honey bees, called swarm, can successfully accomplish tasks through social cooperation. In the ABC algorithm, there are three types of bees: employed bees, onlooker bees, and scout bees. The employed bees search food around the food source in their memory; meanwhile they share the information of these food sources to the onlooker bees. The onlooker bees tend to select good food sources from those found by the employed bees. The food source that has higher quality (fitness) will have a large chance to be selected by the onlooker bees than the one of lower quality. The scout bees are translated from a few employed bees, which abandon their food sources and search new ones. In the ABC algorithm, the first half of the swarm consists of employed bees, and the second half constitutes the onlooker bees. The number of employed bees or the onlooker bees is equal to the number of solutions in the swarm. The ABC generates a randomly distributed initial population of SN solutions (food sources), where SN denotes the swarm size. Let X_i=\\\\\\\\{x_{i,1},x_{i,2},\\\\ldots,x_{i,n}\\\\\\\\} represent the i^{th} solution in the swarm, where n is the dimension size. Each employed bee X_{i} generates a new candidate solution V_{i} in the neighborhood of its present position as equation below: v_{i,k} = x_{i,k}+\\\\Phi_{i,k}\\\\times (x_{i,k}-x_{j,k}) where X_j is a randomly selected candidate solution (i eq j), k is a random dimension index selected from the set \\\\\\\\{1,2,\\\\ldots,n\\\\\\\\}, and \\\\Phi_{i,k} is a random number within [-1,1]. Once the new candidate solution V_i is generated, a greedy selection is used. If the fitness value of V_i is better than that of its parent X_i, then update X_i with V_i; otherwise keep X_i unchanged. After all employed bees complete the search process; they share the information of their food sources with the onlooker bees through waggle dances. An onlooker bee evaluates the nectar information taken from all employed bees and chooses a food source with a probability related to its nectar amount. This probabilistic selection is really a roulette wheel selection mechanism which is described as equation below: P_i=\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm {fit}_i}{\\\\sum_j{\\\\mathrm {fit}_j}} where \\\\mathrm {fit}_i is the fitness value of the i^{th} solution in the swarm. As seen, the better the solution i, the higher the probability of the i^{th} food source selected. If a position cannot be improved over a predefined number (called limit) of cycles, then the food source is abandoned. Assume that the abandoned source is X_i, and then the scout bee discovers a new food source to be replaced with i^{th} as equation below: x_{i,k}=lb_k+\\\\Phi_{i,k}\\\\times(ub_k-lb_k) where \\\\Phi_{i,k}=\\\\mathrm {rand}(0,1) is a random number within[0,1] based on a normal distribution, and lb_k, ub_k are lower and upper boundaries of the k^{th} dimension, respectively.

History This station received its original construction permit from the Federal Communications Commission on May 16, 1989. The permit was for a new facility in Talladega, Alabama, broadcasting at 97.5 MHz with 3,000 watts of effective radiated power from a tower 44 meters in height above average terrain. In December 1989, this was modified to lower the power to 910 watts but raise the antenna to 175 meters above the average terrain. The new station was assigned the call letters WSSY- FM by the FCC on February 21, 1990. On that same day, permit holder Allan G. Stroh filed with the FCC to assign the permit to his Stroh Communications Corp. The transfer was approved by the FCC on March 20, 1990, and the transaction was consummated on April 23, 1990. WSSY-FM received its license to cover from the FCC on March 5, 1991. In May 1991, Stroh Communications Corp. reached an agreement to sell this station to Talladega Broadcast Partners, Ltd. The deal was approved by the FCC on June 4, 1991, and the transaction was consummated on the same day.
