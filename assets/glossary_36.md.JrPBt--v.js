The ensembles are frequently dense, the harmonies quite original and there are often several events occurring at the same time; one would swear there were at least four or five horns being heard in spots...

It is known as the birthplace of the German Romantic poet Joseph Freiherr von Eichendorff. Geography It is situated in the historic Upper Silesia region, in the southeastern part of the Silesian Lowlands on the higher left bank of the Oder river, approximately north-east of Rudnik, north of Racib√≥rz, and west of the regional capital Katowice. The village has a population of about 365. Several inhabitants belong to the German minority in Poland. History Archaeological findings denote a fortress possibly already existed at the site during the era of the Lusatian culture from the 9th century to the 6th century BC. The settlement of ≈Åubowice in the Upper Silesian Duchy of Racib√≥rz was first mentioned in 1376 AD, when the former Piast duchy was part of the Lands of the Bohemian Crown. Schloss Lubowitz, c. 1939 ≈Åubowice Palace (Pa≈Çac Eichendorff√≥w), south of the village, was the birthplace of Joseph von Eichendorff in 1788. The Eichendorff noble family, originally from Zerbow in the Brandenburgian Neumark region, had acquired the manor in 1784. It remained the domicile of Joseph von Eichendorff's mother Karoline until her death in 1822, after which it was sold by auction and later purchased by Salomon Mayer von Rothschild. From 1852 it was a possession of Prince Victor of Hohenlohe-Schillingsf√ºrst and his descendants, who bore the title of a \\"Duke of Ratibor\\" since 1840. The palace was largely rebuilt in a Tudor style from 1858 to 1862. It was leased to the Eichendorff literary society in 1938. The site of a Wehrmacht artillery post in the late days of World War II, the castle was heavily bombed and burnt down completely during the Red Army Vistula-Oder Offensive. On 14 November 1989, during the Revolutions of 1989, the Polish prime minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki and German chancellor Helmut Kohl agreed to preserve the common heritage at ≈Åubowice. A Polish Eichendorff association was founded and an Upper Silesian cultural and meeting centre opened at ≈Åubowice on 12 July 2000. The castle's reconstruction is a matter of ongoing discussions.

Abrupt changes of clock settings have been found to cause problems for software relying on timing. This led to the development of the Network Time Protocol, which gradually changes the system time and does not skip ticks. Due to the problems described above, rdate is generally used only on systems where NTP is not available, or in specialized circumstances where it is required that system time be set correctly as soon as possible during initial setup, before services which may be vulnerable to abrupt time- changes have started.

In legends, he even discovered some of the secrets of the gods. In order to make dykes that would ward off floods, he stole Xirang () (self-renewing soil) from the gods. After the dykes were finished, when the water levels rose, the magical earth of the dyke also rose to keep the water out. It worked very well at first, but when the dykes rose too high (in the legend, they rose to nine r√®n ‰ªû (an ancient Chinese measure of between 1 and 3 meters)), they collapsed, resulting in the death of many people in the subsequent flood. Some legends say that Gun was executed by Shun on Feather Mountain with the sword of Wu, other sources however state that he committed suicide by jumping into an abyss, transformed into an animal and became the god of the abyss. Before his death he told his son, Yu the Great, to finish his job. Classic of Mountains and Seas records that Gun is the grandson of Huangdi, and his father is Luo Ming.

The highway runs north into Kansas. Route description U.S. 169 begins at an interchange with the Creek Turnpike and U.S. 64 in Tulsa. US-64/US-169 then head north from the Creek Turnpike, and the two routes pass through southeast Tulsa on a due north course, as the Mingo Valley Expressway. Upon reaching the Broken Arrow Expressway (State Highway 51), US-64 splits off toward Downtown Tulsa, while US-169 continues north through east Tulsa. The next interchange US-169 has with another freeway is with I-44; to the north of this, it interchanges with I-244. As it continues north, US-169 serves as the western terminus of SH-266. The freeway crosses Bird Creek on new bridges built in 2015-1016 (replacing a pair of 1960-vintage through truss bridges) north of I-44. US-169 then enters the north Tulsa suburb of Owasso. Here, the freeway's interchange with 2nd Avenue also forms the eastern terminus of SH-135, an unsigned highway. The freeway continues on towards Collinsville, where it has a concurrency with SH-20. North of Collinsville, the freeway ends, and US-169 continues northeast as an at-grade highway. The highway briefly crosses into Rogers County, then re- enters Tulsa County, before returning to Rogers County once again. In Rogers County, US-169 heads northeast until it reaches the town of Oologah, birthplace of Will Rogers, where it serves as the western terminus for SH-88. South of the town, US-169 crosses Fourmile Creek, a tributary of the Verdigris River; the route will parallel this creek until its source as the road continues north. The highway also runs parallel to a rail line for the remainder of its time in Oklahoma, and several miles to the east, it also parallels the shoreline of Oologah Lake. As the highway passes through northern Rogers County, the highway bisects the town of Talala. Soon after US-169 crosses from Rogers County to Nowata County, the highway passes through the unincorporated location of Watova, Oklahoma. The route then enters the county seat, Nowata. US-169 Alternate follows the old route of US-169 through downtown Nowata, while mainline US-169 cuts through the eastern side of town. Both branches of US-169 intersect with US-60 in Nowata. North of Nowata, the highway passes to the west of Nowata Municipal Airport, then crosses California Creek, a tributary of the Verdigris. Southeast of Delaware, US-169 meets SH-28 at its western terminus. As US-169 continues north, it passes to the east of Delaware and Lenapah. East of Lenapah, it begins a concurrency with SH-10, which lasts for before SH-10 splits off to the west. US-169 continues north through unincorporated Elliott, then enters the border town of South Coffeyville. In South Coffeyville, the highway crosses the state line into Montgomery County, Kansas; it continues north towards Coffeyville. History US-169 was first designated through Oklahoma on June 17, 1935.

Born in 1775, Allan Gilmour Sr. was the son of Allan Gilmour and Elizabeth Pollok. He attended the Mearns parish school in the 1780s and early 1790s, and by 1795 ran a small timber business there. By 1802, he had moved to Glasgow and his trade now extended to the Baltic, Russia, and Norway. In 1804, he co-founded the Glasgow-based firm Pollok, Gilmour and Company, together with the brothers John Pollok and Arthur Pollok. Gilmour took charge of pursuing increased international trade for the business, making several trips to North America and Norway to open additional lines of trade. At its peak, and as a result of Gilmour's enterprises, Pollok, Gilmour & Company controlled one of the largest fleets of ships in the world, commanding over 100 vessels. Suffering from the Napoleonic blockade of Baltic timber, he quickly established a new, North American base for the company, sending his brother James Gilmour, and Alexander Rankin to the Miramichi River (New Brunswick, Canada) in 1812. Pollok, Gilmour and Company was soon the largest operator in the British North American timber market, with further branches established at Saint John (1822), Quebec (1828), Montreal (1829), Bathurst, N.B. (1832), and Dalhousie and Campbellton (1833). In 1837 a rift developed between Gilmour and the Pollok brothers. To resolve the dispute, effective leadership was transferred to Robert Rankin, the manager of the Saint John operation. After his retirement, his health soon declined. He suffered a paralytic stroke in 1849. He died later in the same year leaving most of his property, to the sons of his brother James ReferencesBibliography *John Rankin, A history of our firm: being some account of the firm of Pollok, Gilmour and Co. and its offshoots and connections, 1804-1920, publ. 1921. 1775 births 1849 deaths 19th-century Scottish people ","title":"Allan Gilmour Sr."},{"id":"21263152","title":"Pursurah (community development block)"},{"id":"21263161","text":"Club Deportivo Esp√≠ritu Santo is a Salvadoran professional football club based at Isla el Jobal, Usulut√°n Department, El Salvador.

The base is a corm, a swollen underground stem lasting one year. The flowers are up to 5 cm long and coloured deep orange.Clapham, A.R., Tutin, T.G. and Warburg, E.F.. 1968. Excursion Flora of the British Isles. Cambridge University Press. Cultivation In the United States, Crocosmia √ó crocosmiiflora is considered suitable for planting in hardiness zones 5‚Äì9, but in more northerly locations it can be planted in the spring and the corms dug out in the fall. The corms should be planted in a well-drained garden soil in a full sun to partial shade.Planting Instructions, Garden State Bulb Company, Vineland, NJ. 2017. The hybrid will set viable seed that can be grown from seed as soon as ripe, but as a hybrid will not breed true. In Belfast, Northern Ireland it is recorded as well-established in a wide range of locations.Beesley, S. and Wilde, J. 1997. Urban Flora of Belfast.

Prior to administration and the subsequent acquisition of the brand by WHSmith in 2013, it operated as a retail company through a chain of high-street stores and a distribution arm, Amerang; when Modelzone entered administration in June 2013, the company had 47 branches and 385 employees, and was the UK's largest model retailer. On 28 August 2013, administrators announced that the company would cease independent trading during September 2013 and the remaining 18 shops would close at that point. In October 2013, WHSmith announced that it had acquired the ModelZone name, with plans to use the brand to sell products through existing WHSmith branches; 10 of its shops had begun to carry products under the brand name by the end of November 2013, with WHSmith also using the Modelzone name to sell online by December 2013.  History = Beginnings and name change = Originally incorporated as Model Aircraft (Bournemouth) Ltd on 8 November 1937, the company started with one store in Brighton in the 1930s. When this was sold after about 40 years under the same ownership, the store was bought in order to be \\"a showroom for the importers of many prestige model ranges\\". Following success at this store, the new owners then began to purchase other shops, in Crawley, Eastbourne, Guildford and Maidstone, and brand them as Model Aerodrome. During the mid-90s a computerised stock control system was implemented, and in 1995 and 1996 respectively, the company opened stores in Croydon and Plymouth. In March 1999, after the opening of their eighth branch in Bluewater, Kent, the company expanded its range to include Scalextric and Corgi products, and with this expansion of their product line, changed their name to Modelzone. They then eventually acquired a number of stores formerly owned by the Beatties chain of model shops (which had closed when its parent company, ERA Group, placed it into administration). =Investor buyout and expansion = In July 2009, ModelZone's new investors sought to \\"defy the credit crunch\\" through a buyout led by CEO David Mordecai and non-executive chairman Terry Norris. The buyout was the subject of a prolonged negotiation with private equity investor Lloyds Development Capital, who were initially sceptical of Modelzone's long-term growth forecast. Indeed, as LDC Investment Manager Miles Frost commented in 2010, \\"The credit crunch hit in 2008 and backing a retailer was a scary prospect for an investor, especially when Modelzone's sales were declining.\\" Despite LDC's initial scepticism, a strong Christmas performance and internal reforms towards the end of 2008 led LDC to reappraise ModelZone's growth prospects and agree an MBO in July 2009. This agreement saw LDC invest ¬£5.6 million supported by a further ¬£3.6 million of funding over three years. With the MBO complete, in 2010 the ModelZone board began an aggressive expansion plan which saw 15 stores open between 2010 and 2012, including in Scotland and in Wales. By the end of 2012 the company had grown to 47 stores, but this \\"disastrous\\" expansion would prove to be too much for the company as it entered into administration at the end of the second quarter of 2013. In one of their most recent accounts, Modelzone stated: = Administration and store closures = The company announced on 26 June 2013 that it had gone into administration. The announcement was made on Modelzone's website, minutes after informing staff, and with the rest of the ecommerce site having been abandoned. Many staff on leave and planned rest days learned of the administration through the website closure and social media: The administration was announced just hours after retailers were due to pay rent for the next three months on 24 June, the quarterly rent day, and after ensuring the monthly staff salary pay day run on the 25th of each month, and securing capital return to investors with Deloitte. Alongside the notice on the company's website, notices were placed on the company's e-commerce website refusing all online trade (including Amazon and eBay accounts). Gift vouchers were still being accepted, but at 50% of their face value. Administrators Deloitte were reported to have been approached with a bid by former owner David Mordecai, who had been made chief executive of Tobar Group after it and subsidiary company toy retailer Hawkin's Bazaar were bought out of administration in 2012. This bid was reported to have been for 20 to 25 stores of the then-47 store chain, but according to Mordecai, \\"the administrators will not look to break the chain up. They are only looking to sell the whole lot.\\" Five stores had been closed by 5 August 2013 with the loss of 45 jobs, with a further 10 branches closed by 13 August 2013, with the loss of a further 66 jobs, taking the company's retail presence down to 32 stores. A spokesman for Deloitte stated that \\"[t]he joint administrators to Modelzone are still trying to find a potential buyer for some or all of the stores. Unfortunately, to date no such purchaser has come forward.\\" On 19 August 2013, Deloitte announced the closure of a further 10 stores, affecting the jobs of a further 76 members of store staff. Administrator Richard Hawes at Deloitte said, \\"During the administration, it has become clear that all stores will not be able to continue to trade profitably, hence the closures announced this week. The administrators would like to thank the company's employees for their support and professionalism during this time.\\" The closure of ModelZone's stores was expected to have a negative effect on Hornby, whose long-standing partnership with Modelzone saw it selling stock as a concession within Modelzone stores. Hornby itself posted pre-tax losses of ¬£3.4 million after \\"disappointing\\" sales of London 2012 merchandise. The day after Modelzone's administration proceedings were announced, Hornby released a statement to the stock market in response: The administration of the business also included Modelzone's wholesale and distribution arm, Amerang Ltd, which operated from the same head offices and under the same management. On 17 July 2013 administrators announced that major competitor Ripmax Ltd had bought Amerang from the Modelzone group through newly incorporated company Pinehurst 104 Ltd, safeguarding the jobs of the wholesaler's 18 remaining employees. Joint Administrator Richard Hawes said that they \\"are delighted to have secured a buyer for Amerang, which continues to be an attractive brand given the strength of its customer and supplier base and its reputation in the market\\". = End of trading = Modelzone Newcastle upon Tyne after its closure in September 2013.

Piql AS is based in Drammen, Norway. The Cinevator is currently available in three versions: Cinevator HD The Cinevator HD is the entry-level model. It is available as a film recorder only or as a combined film recorder/film printer with sound and subtitles. The Cinevator HD records 24/25 frames per second in native HD resolution on all supported film stocks. Its imaging engine is based on DLP technology from Texas Instruments and a patented LED light source.  Cinevator One  The Cinevator One is a digital film recorder that operates in real time. This machine produces negative intermediate images in the speed of 24 frames per second. The Cinevator One receives film data in real time through an SDI link or DVI input. Based on the film data available, recording or printing jobs are prepared on a job preparation workstation (a normal desktop PC that is connected to the Cinevator One). Sound and subtitle files are loaded through the job preparation workstation. Remote Disk Recorders or VTR‚Äôs can be connected to the Cinevator One through Ethernet or serial line, and these can be controlled from the job preparation work station.  Cinevator Five  The Cinevator Five is the top model of the range, making it possible to go directly to positive print film including both digital and analog sound and subtitles in real time. Going directly to print film eliminates all the processes involving negative intermediate and the contact printing that might deteriorate the image and sound quality. This machine can also make negative intermediate and interpositive film. Sound is recorded from either Dolby CA-10R (via MO disk), DTS time code generator or embedded sound on a disk recorder or VTR. Remote disk recorders or VTRs can be connected to the Cinevator Five through Ethernet or serial line. The subtitle feature is improved greatly in the recent times and one can even change color and size of subtitle and also its placement in the frame. There is a sharp shadow at the edge of the subtitle which make the subtitle visible clearly even on same color background. In March 2008, the Cinevator Five won the Red Dot Design Award.Red Dot Design Awards Homepage, March 2008 .

Stowell was educated at St Paul's School, followed by St Thomas' Hospital. From 1910, he took clinical training at St Thomas's Hospital, Grimsby and District Hospital, and the Royal Southern Hospital, Liverpool. He qualified as a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1912. In 1927, he gained a Doctorate in Medicine, and in 1954 he received the Diploma in Industrial Health honoris causa from the Worshipful Society of Apothecaries. Stowell was descended from William Scott, 1st Baron Stowell. In 1913, he married Lillian Elizabeth Wagner. Their son, Eldon Stowell, was also a doctor. Their only daughter died in an accident in 1958. His clinical appointments included assistant ophthalmic surgeon at St Andrew's Hospital, Bromley-by-Bow, and Battersea General Hospital; surgeon at St Mary's Hospital, Sidcup; honorary surgeon at Northwich Infirmary; senior honorary surgeon and radiologist at the Mid Cheshire Orthopaedic Clinic, Northwich; and consulting surgeon in the Emergency Medical Service. He was chief medical officer to Imperial Chemical Industries, traumatic surgeon to Brunner Mond, and a founder of the Association of Industrial Medical Officers (now the Society of Occupational Medicine). He served as chair of the Council of Industrial Medicine, the medical advisory committee of the Industrial Welfare Society, the British Committee of International Congresses on Industrial Health and Safety, and the British Organizing Council for the IX International Council of Industrial Health in London in 1948. For his work in the latter appointment, he was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1949. Outside of medicine, Stowell entered the public eye just a few days before his death because of an article he had published in the November 1970 issue of The Criminologist.Stowell, T. E. A. (November 1970) \\"Jack the Ripper ‚Äì A Solution?\\". The Criminologist vol.5 pp.40‚Äì51 Stowell appeared to indicate that he either possessed or had seen evidence implicating Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale, in the notorious \\"Jack the Ripper\\" murders eighty years before.Rumbelow, Donald (2004).

Accessed 28 November 2008Knight, Stephen (1976; rev. 1984; repr. 2000). Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution. London: Bounty Books. . pp. 15‚Äì16. During an appearance on the BBC current affairs programme 24 Hours on 2 November, Stowell \\"seemed to accept tacitly\\" that the Duke was the Ripper.PHS (4 November 1970). \\"Court Circular clears Clarence\\". The Times p.12; col.E. However, on 5 November 1970 Stowell wrote to The Times newspaper, \\"I have at no time associated His Royal Highness, the late Duke of Clarence, with the Whitechapel murderer.\\"Stowell, T. E. A. (9 November 1970). \\"Jack the Ripper\\". The Times p.9; Issue 58018; col.F. The letter was published on 9 November, the day after Stowell's own death. The same week, Stowell's son reported that he had burned his father's papers, saying \\"I read just sufficient to make certain that there was nothing of importance.\\"PHS (14 November 1970). \\"The Times Diary: Ripper file destroyed\\". The Times p.12; Issue 58023; col.E Stowell's article awakened public interest in the Ripper murders, and the supposed connection of Prince Albert Victor to the murders was later developed by other writers, such as Stephen Knight in Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution. Stowell's other interests included Freemasonry. He privately published The Centenary History of Cornubian Lodge 450 of Free and Accepted Masons in 1950. Stowell's obituary in the British Medical Journal described him as \\"a tall elegant figure, with an intellectual face and sporting a monocle. Naturally witty, he was gifted with a fine sense of humour and a sense of fun. All this considered, and given that he was a splendid raconteur, he made an admirable companion.\\"British Medical Journal, 21 November 1970, p. 499 References 1885 births 1970 deaths British surgeons Freemasons of the United Grand Lodge of England Commanders of the Order of the British Empire Fellows of the Royal College of Surgeons Jack the Ripper People educated at St Paul's School, London ","title":"Thomas E.

With the Conservative Party of Antonio C√°novas del Castillo, it formed a two- party system of alternating governments, the turno, which characterised the Spanish Restoration during the late 19th century and the early 20th century. It combined republicans who did not accept the new law reflected in the Constitution of 1876 as well as monarchists, members of the Constitutional Party of general Francisco Serrano, of the Partido Radical of Manuel Ruiz Zorrilla, the ‚Äúposibilistas‚Äù of Emilio Castelar and other military groupings. Its political programme included achieving universal male suffrage, which was achieved in 1890; liberty of religious association; and the separation of powers. Although it could be classified as a dynastic party, its membership included at the start of the 20th century some politicians who would later become Republicans, such as Niceto Alcal√° Zamora. The system of political alternation characterising the Restoration began when C√°novas ceded power to Sagasta and he formed the first government of 8 February 1881, which started the first stage of the system that would see three liberal governments (two headed by Sagasta and one by Jos√© Posada). The second stage began when the system was institutionalised and endorsed in 1885 when both parties signed the Pact of El Pardo, which established that the parties would alternate in power after the death of Alfonso XII of Spain, which was guaranteed by the caciques networks with which both parties were involved across Spain. The pact kept out of power radical ideologies like anarchism, socialism and republicanism, which could threaten the monarchic regime. In 1898, the first split in the Liberal Party occurred by Germ√°n Gamazo abandoning the party and leading a breakaway group, which ended up merging with the Conservative Party. After Sagasta's death in 1903, a leadership contest occurred between Eugenio Montero R√≠os and Segismundo Moret, which eventually led to Jos√© Canalejas leading the party. He tried to reform it and bring it closer to the reality of the country, but his attempts to evolve the party were cut short by his murder in 1912. That reopened a leadership struggle between two new protagonists, the Conde de Romanones and Manuel Garc√≠a Prieto, and led the party into a deep crisis, coinciding with the disintegration of the political system in which it had played a major part. The disintegration ended in 1931 with the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera and finally the monarchy of Alfonso XIII of Spain.

It switched to NBC radio in 1947, and on September 10, 1950, the name of the program was changed to The $64 Question.  Gameplay  Contestants were asked questions devised by the series' writer-researcher Edith Oliver. She attempted to make each question slightly more difficult than the preceding one. After answering a question correctly, the contestant had the choice to \\"take\\" the prize for that question or \\"leave it\\" in favor of a chance at the next question. The first question was worth one dollar, and the value doubled for each successive question, up to the seventh and final question worth $64.  Cultural influence  During the 1940s, \\"That's the $64 question\\" became a common catchphrase for a particularly difficult question or problem. In addition to the common phrase \\"Take it or leave it\\", the show also popularized another phrase, widely spoken in the 1940s as a taunt but now mostly forgotten (except in Warner Bros. cartoons). Chanted in unison by the entire audience when someone chose to risk their winnings by going for the $64 prize, it was vocalized with a rising inflection: \\"You'll be sorry!\\" The popularity of the radio program inspired a 1944 20th Century Fox feature film, Take It or Leave It, about a man who needs $1,000 to pay his wife's obstetrician. When he is chosen as a contestant on the radio quiz show, the prize money is increased beyond the usual $64. Take It or Leave It was inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame in 1990.  Hosts  The CBS radio version of the show was first hosted by Bob Hawk (1940‚Äì41), followed by Phil Baker (1941‚Äì47).In 1947, the series switched to NBC, hosted at various times by Baker, Garry Moore (1947‚Äì49), Eddie Cantor (1949‚Äì50) and Jack Paar (beginning June 11, 1950). Paar continued as host through the change of the series's name to The $64 Question, and was followed by Baker (March‚ÄìDecember 1951) and Paar (back in December 1951).

In the years 1975‚Äì1998 the town administratively belonged to the Katowice Province Name The name of the village in the Latinized form of the old Polish Jezyorowycze villa is mentioned in the years (1470-1480) by Jan D≈Çugosz in the book of Liber beneficiorum dioecesis Cracoviensis. History In the 15th century it was a royal village mentioned by D≈Çugosz, belonging to the ≈ªarnowiec parish. At the beginning of the 16th century, sources mention 7. peasants in Jeziorowice. In 1627, as a result of the then raging plague, there were 3 peasants in the village. Around 1650 the village was put in as a pledge. According to the lustration from 1660, a non-castle district of Jeziorowickie, separated from the ≈ªarnowiec eldership, along with the farm and adjacent lands in the Krakow Province, Lel√≥w Poviat, was established here. In 1771, Jeziorowice was owned by Antoni Sikorski, a swordfish from Chƒôciny. In the years 1773‚Äì1775 at the Warsaw Seym of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, Sikorski was granted the possession of the Jeziorowice eldership for 40 years, for carrying out drainage for PLN 40,000, provided that he did not give up this property earlier than the Treasury of Poland would pay him that sum. In the nineteenth century, Jeziorowice and the farm belonging to the Ma≈Çoszyce estate were incorporated into the majorate of ≈ªarnowiec. During the Kingdom of Poland, Ma≈Çoszyce, Otola and Jeziorowice were combined into one unit, under the name Dobra Ma≈Çoszyce, and was given to General Fejchtner in 1877.

It is the seat of the gmina (administrative district) called Gmina ≈ªarnowiec. It lies in historic Lesser Poland, approximately east of Zawiercie and north-east of the regional capital Katowice. Even though the village now belongs to Silesian Voivodeship, it has never been part of Silesia. Until 1975, it was administratively tied with Lesser Poland's cities of Krak√≥w and Kielce. The village has a population of 830.  Location  ≈ªarnowiec lies in northeastern corner of Silesian Voivodeship, on the Pilica River, among the hills of the Krak√≥w-Czƒôstochowa Upland. The distance to Zawiercie is 30 km, to Krak√≥w 50 km, and to Katowice - 70 km. The village belongs to Lesser Poland.  History  The village was first mentioned in the Chronicle of Gallus Anonymus, who wrote that near ≈ªarnowiec, Prince W≈Çadys≈Çaw I Herman met with his sons Zbigniew of Poland and Boles≈Çaw III Wrymouth. Most probably this meeting took place in 1098. Originally, ≈ªarnowiec was located in the area of today's village of ≈Åany Wielkie. Some time between 1326 and 1340, the town was moved 3 kilometers north along the Pilica River, where it has remained. The previous location of ≈ªarnowiec was in 1388 renamed as Old ≈ªarnowiec. In 1388 the name was changed to ≈Åany, and in 1529 to ≈Åany Wielkie. ≈ªarnowiec was granted town rights by King Kazimierz Wielki some time between the 1320s and 1340s. There are theories that it had been incorporated earlier, in the 1250s, by Prince Boles≈Çaw V the Chaste. The first local church of Saint Wojciech was built here between 999 and 1243. The parish church at ≈Åany Wielkie now occupies this site. King Kazimierz Wielki contributed a lot to the development and prosperity of the town. It was due to his initiative that a castle was built here, as well as a church. In 1355-56, Kazimierz Wielki imprisoned his wife Adelaide of Hesse at ≈ªarnowiec Castle. The king frequently visited the town. In the 14th century ≈ªarnowiec emerged as a center of local administration. King W≈Çadys≈Çaw Jagie≈Ç≈Ço also visited the town, confirming its privileges in 1396. At that time ≈ªarnowiec was the seat of a county, located in Lesser Poland's Krak√≥w Voivodeship. In the 16th century ≈ªarnowiec was one of the most important urban centers of Lesser Poland, and the seat of a starosta. In 1570 it had 50 beer producers, and around 200 houses. But, like most towns of Lesser Poland, ≈ªarnowiec was destroyed by the Swedes in the Deluge (1655 - 1660) related to its invasion of the area. The town population was decimated by the war. The great fire of 1697 destroyed what was left after the wars. In 1756 there were 129 houses at ≈ªarnowiec, of which 78 were empty. In 1775, ≈ªarnowiec castle burned. In 1795, the town was annexed by the Habsburg Monarchy/Austrian Empire. The population did not start to grow until this period, due mostly to an increase in Jewish settlers from other parts of the empire. They made up more than 50% of town's population by the 1850s. The American writer and diplomat Joel Barlow died here in 1812. As the United States Minister to France, he had traveled to Vilnius to meet with the French foreign minister, who was there in relation to Napoleon's invasion of Russia. Upon his arrival, Barlow learned that the Grande Arm√©e was already in full retreat from Moscow. On his way back to Paris by way of Vienna, Barlow became ill and died of pneumonia in ≈ªarnowiec. After 1815, ≈ªarnowiec became part of the Russian-controlled Congress Kingdom. The town burned again in 1816. Twenty years later, the construction of a main road from Krak√≥w to Warsaw bypassed ≈ªarnowiec, which contributed to the town's long-term decline. During the January Uprising, ≈ªarnowiec was one of the centers of rebellion; a battle with the Russians took place here on February 20, 1863. As a punishment, Russian government demoted ≈ªarnowiec to the status of a village (June 1, 1869). In 1925, the Jewish Community, including some residents from small nearby villages, consisted of a total of 1,780 people; some 118 families were chosen to pay the community fees. Other families were exempted because of poverty. Some Jews were emigrating to the United States, joining family who had gone before. About 1930 the Jewish community owned a brick synagogue in Warszawska Street, which had a rabbi's prayer room and women's gallery next to the main hall. What was known as the \\"old synagogue‚Äù, made of wood, was also located in Warszawska Street. The mikvah adjacent to the new synagogue was leased. The cemetery was located by the road leading to the village of Chliny.\\"≈ªarnowiec\\", Virtual Shtetl, Museum of the History of Polish Jews In 1930, the population of ≈ªarnowiec alone was 2,127 people, including 920 Jews. Some emigrated to other countries or migrated to cities for work. By 1938 the Jewish population had declined to 574. Most of villagers died after the 1939 invasion of Nazi troops and the Holocaust, which included persecution, and deportation to concentration and death camps.

Putnam's Sons. Themes and setting Although McKinley does not explain the situation in detail, the book indicates that the country is divided into demesnes, each one with a Master, and that Master's Circle (The Master is part of the Circle). There is an Overlord over all of the demesnes. The Circle's task is to maintain the stability of the land, including the housing and health of the human and non-human inhabitants, and of the land itself. They do this by tending to the earthlines, apparently zones of importance in maintaining order. If the earthlines are disturbed, or not maintained, there may be disease, fire, deterioration of buildings and fences, and sickness of humans and animals. Each Circle has twelve members, each with a title, Chalice and Master being two of those titles. Chalices seem to always be female. Some of the officers of the Circle where the action in Chalice takes place are male, some female. Circle members usually have apprentices. Replacement of Circle members, often by their apprentices, is by divination, which seems to be supernaturally guided, and is usually carried out by the Prelate, a Circle member, who uses rods to select new members. The Grand Seneschal is another important member of the Circle. The Master has the most power, the Chalice next, and the Grand Seneschal is third in power and ability to take care of the land. The demesne where the story takes place is Willowlands. Mastership is usually hereditary. In cases where that is not possible, and a new Master is brought in from another demesne, the Master and his demesne, and its people, may not achieve stability for generations. There is an established religion, with three types of priests, those of Earth, Air and Fire, but no description of the practices of this religion.  Plot summary Chalice is welcoming a new Master. The Chalice must be the first to greet the new Master. The reason for a new Master is that the old one, and the former Chalice, died in a fire, which was caused by some of their own actions, a few months earlier. The now-dead Master was concerned only with his own pleasure and power, and neglected his duties to his demesne. Seven years before the story begins, the Master sent his brother away, to join the priests of Fire. The brother had been concerned about the demesne, and opposed the Master's ways. When the older brother died, the Grand Seneschal sent for the younger brother, asking that he become the new Master. The brother is welcomed by the Circle, and the people of the demesne, but has changed, physically and mentally, so that he can hardly interact with the people of the demesne at all. Mirasol, the Chalice, was a peasant, living by herself in a cottage within walking distance of the House of the demesne, but having nothing to do with its inhabitants, until, to everyone's surprise, she was chosen as Chalice. She raises bees, left to her by her dead parents. The bees are special. For a period of time, they produced so much honey that Mirasol couldn't take care of it. They are larger than normal bees, they seem to understand the Chalice, and protect her, and they produce special types of honey. The Chalice has had no training for the job. She has read every manuscript she can find that tells her what a Chalice must do, and how, but there is a lot she doesn't know. She thinks that the rest of the Circle, especially the Grand Seneschal, believes that she was a bad choice. She performs her job as best she can, operating from what she has read, and from her intuition, in deciding what vessel to use, and what to put in it, for each occasion. She mixes honey with the various drinks she offers to people involved in ceremonies of the Circle, or to pour out. This use of honey is new. It has never been used this way before. During the seven days between the supposed insult and the time of the combat, the Chalice repairs as many of the earthlines of the demesne as possible. (She later learns that the Master has been helping her in this.) On the day of the combat, she returns to the House, to see that the Master will be forced to fight with swords, and has decided that his demesne would be better off if he was killed. But the Chalice's amazing bees have something to say about this. They blanket the combatants, kill the heir, and transform the Master back to near normalcy. Many of the bees die in the process. The Overlord departs in defeat. Some of the Circle resign their positions, because they haven't supported the Master. By the end of the book, it is clear that the Chalice and the Master will marry, and everyone live happily every after.

Geography Hutt Lagoon is an elongate lake that sits in a dune swale adjacent to the coast. The town of Gregory is located between the ocean and the lake's southern shores. The road between Northampton and Kalbarri, George Grey Drive, runs along its eastern edge.StreetSmart Travellers Atlas of Western Australia (2002) The lake is about in length along its northwest- southeast axis, parallel with the coast, and around wide. Hutt Lagoon comprises most of the Hutt Lagoon System, a DIWA-listed wetland system that also takes in a number of adjacent small lakes, such as Utcha Swamp. Hydrology The lagoon, a marginal-marine salina or marine lake, is an elongate depression about in area, with most of it lying a few metres below sea level. It is separated from the Indian Ocean by a beach barrier ridge and barrier dune system. Similar to Lake MacLeod, to the north of Carnarvon, Hutt Lagoon is fed by marine waters through the barrier ridge and by meteoric waters through springs. Due to the salina‚Äôs sub-sealevel position, seepage of seawater into the salina is continuous year round. During the winter wet season, the amount of water coming into the salina is substantially increased by the influx of meteoric groundwater. Hutt Lagoon has a Mediterranean climate, with mean annual rainfall of (mainly May to August), and a mean annual evaporation rate of . These factors combine to form a setting within which salt is deposited seasonally and the rates and style of precipitation follow a balance between influx of water and removal by evaporation. During the summer about 95% of the salina surface is a dry salt flat. History Hutt Lagoon was named by the explorer George Grey who camped on its eastern edge on 4 April 1839, while on his second disastrous expedition along the Western Australian coast. He mistook the wet season lagoon for a large estuary and named \\"the river and estuary now discovered\\" after William Hutt, M.P., brother of John Hutt, the second Governor of Western Australia. Hutt was a British Liberal politician who was heavily involved in the colonization of Western Australia, New Zealand and South Australia. After Grey's arrival back in Perth, Governor Hutt dispatched the colonial schooner Champion under Captain Dring to investigate the large estuary and river discovered. In summer, January 1840, George Fletcher Moore aboard Champion reported the Hutt River at its mouth to be dry, and could not locate the large estuary described by Grey. Resources= √ü-carotene = Hutt Lagoon is a pink lake, a salt lake with a red or pink hue due to the presence of the carotenoid-producing algae Dunaliella salina, a source of √ü-carotene, a food-colouring agent and source of vitamin A. The lagoon contains the world's largest microalgae production plant, a series of artificial ponds used to farm Dunaliella salina. = Brine shrimp = Hutt Lagoon provides a commercial supply of Artemia parthenogenetica brine shrimp. Artemia is a specialty feed used by prawn and fish farmers and the aquarium fish trade. = Salt and gypsum = In 1854 the explorer Augustus Charles Gregory promoted the quantity and quality of the salt deposits at Hutt Lagoon and their proximity to Port Gregory. He also commended the gypsum deposits on the western shore of the lagoon. At the 1873 Sydney Intercolonial Exhibition salt from the Hutt Lagoon deposit was Highly Commended. Hutt Lagoon gypsum received a Bronze Medal. Hutt Lagoon salt was also exhibited at the 1880 Melbourne Exhibition. In August 1908 Port Gregory Saltworks consigned its first shipment of salt on SS Venus. Production was seasonal, of the order of 4,000 tons per year and employing up to 50, until the salt operation went into liquidation in 1924.

It is a popular tourist destination, with guest houses and winter sports facilities.  History  The village of Rajcza was founded in the first half of the 17th century, when this area belonged to Krak√≥w Voivodeship, of the Polish - Lithuanian Commonwealth. At that time Rajcza belonged to Queen Constance of Austria, the wife of King Sigismund III Vasa, part of her folwark with main center located at Wƒôgierska G√≥rka. Following the Partitions of Poland Rajcza, together with southwestern Lesser Poland, became annexed by the Austrian Empire (1772). In 1843, iron manufacture was opened here, and 1854-1894, the owner of the village, Teodor Primavesi, remodeled a local palace, establishing a park around it. In 1884 Rajcza got rail connection with ≈ªywiec and Cadca, and 10 years later, the village was purchased by the Lubomirski family, who expanded the palace. In 1914, Rajcza was bought by ≈ªywiec branch of the Habsburgs. In 1880 the village had 2,037 inhabitants, with 140 Jews, and 25 Germans. In the Second Polish Republic Rajcza became a popular tourist destination. At that time, it had a Jewish minority, which in 1921 was estimated at 132. During World War II, Rajcza, together with whole ≈ªywiec County, was directly incorporated into the Third Reich. Local Jews were transported to a ghetto in Sucha Beskidzka, and then murdered in death camps. In October 1940, during Action Saybusch, 115 Polish families (501 persons) were forced to abandon their houses. The Poles were replaced with ethnic Germans from Bucovina. In May 1945, Rajcza was captured by the Red Army. Until 1975, the village remained in Krak√≥w Voivodeship. In 1975 - 1999, it belonged to Bielsko-Bia≈Ça Voivodeship.

There were different versions for the Army (Heer), Air Force (Luftwaffe) and Navy (Kriegsmarine). History The Honour Roll of the German Army () was first issued in July 1941 after the German invasion of the Soviet Union. The roll recorded the names of soldiers who had distinguished themselves in combat in an exceptional way, and was published in the Army Ordinance Gazette (Heeres-Verordnungsblatt). Until 30 January 1944 it was a paper award only. On this date, Adolf Hitler introduced a physical decoration to be worn in uniform by those who appeared on the Honour Roll. A similar Honour Roll of the German Navy (Ehrentafel der Deutschen Kriegsmarine) was instituted in February 1943, with a wearable decoration introduced in May 1944. The Honour Roll Clasp of the German Air Force (Ehrenblatt der Deutschen Luftwaffe) was instituted on 5 July 1944, with the decoration introduced at the same time. Air Force members who had previously received The Luftwaffe Honour Goblet or the automatically received the Air Force Honour Roll Clasp. For all three services, to qualify for the Honour Roll Clasp a recipient must have: *already have received the Iron Cross in both the first and second class; *once again (after being awarded the Iron Cross in both classes) distinguished himself in combat; and *been included in the Honour Roll of the German Army. Awards were at the discretion of the German High Command and were awarded sparingly to retain a high level of prestige. A total of 4,556 were awarded to members of the army and Waffen-SS. The Waffen-SS was not legally part of the German Army, but were nevertheless eligible on the same conditions as the army. Description The Honour Roll clasp of the Army was made of gilt metal. The decoration contained a wreath measuring 24.5 mm across, formed of six bunches of oak leaves on each side. The width of the wreath was 5 mm at the widest point and tapered to the apex where two oak leaves meet tip-to-tip. The height of the badge from base to tip was 26 mm. The swastika was superimposed upon the separately-made wreath and was soldered onto the wreath assembly. Of the other versions, the Navy clasp comprised a swastika superimposed on an anchor, with the Air Force clasp showing the Luftwaffe eagle, both types displayed within a circular gilt metal oak wreath. The reverse side of all versions had four pins for attachment to allow securing to a strip of Iron Cross second class ribbon. This ribbon was then looped through the second button hole on the tunic of the recipient. The decoration was not worn on the ribbon of the iron cross when the cross itself was worn. Nazi era awards were initially banned by the post-war Federal Republic of Germany. In 1957 many World War II military decorations, including the Honour Roll Clasp, were re-authorised for wear.

It provides education from Grade 7 to 12. Beside the school was the Villafor Elementary School. The school has different clubs that student can join in. History San Agustin Barangay High School was the only public secondary school in Castillejos in 1974 in one of the Barangays in Castillejos, Zambales. Later, it was named San Agustin High School and enrollment gradually increased and recorded 500 students during the school year of 1990. Ten years after, the number tripled and the school plant could no longer contain its increasing population, with only 18 academic classrooms. Further aggravated as a result of wear and tear, the school building was dilapidated. Classroom shortage became the main problem and to address this inconvenience, classes were conducted under the trees and in makeshift rooms. In 1999, San Agustin High School was renamed as Jesus F. Magsaysay High School and was relocated at Barangay San Roque, Castillejos, Zambales where Villaflor Elementary School is also located, leaving the old campus to San Agustin Elementary School. The construction and opening of Jesus F. Magsaysay High School became a highlight for the Department of Education in the Division of Zambales. It was so named because it was through the effort of Governor Vicente P. Magsaysay that this infrastructure became a reality. From then on, enrollment continued to flourish as it is today. It continues to provide quality education for all as the basic tool for development and likewise for the improvement of the community. Education progressed as manifested by the opening of one school after the other. A brainchild of Castor Feria, Principal IV; the Jesus F. Magsaysay High School (2002) at Balaybay, (2002), Jesus F. Magsaysay Technical Vocational High School (2006) at Sta. Maria, and the most recent ‚Äì the re-opening of the San Agustin High School (2008) at San Agustin; all in this town of Castillejos. These schools at present are in full-swing of operation. To date, the main school has one Principal IV, 60 teaching staff, nine head teachers, one guidance counselor, two provincial/ contractual teachers, three non-teaching staff and six general personnel (utility/guard) are under the payroll of the PTA and one utility under the school's payroll. At present, the school operates under the name Castillejos National High School. Renamed through a resolution passed by the Sangguniang Bayan under the administration of then Mayor of the Municipality, Hon. Wilma Dalit Billman on 2009, dedicating the school to the youths and people of Castillejos. This school undertakes the Basic Education Curriculum for the 4th year curriculum, while the Grade 7 to Grade 9 is under K+12 curriculum and has its Special Program in the Arts and Special Program in Sports in June 2012 in answer to the call of the department‚Äôs advocacy to improve learning outcomes and teacher performance.

K. Hall, 1983; p. 45.R. C. S. Trahair, Utopia and Utopians, Westport, CT, Greenwood Publishing, 1999; p. 192. Marie Stevens had to leave school and support her younger sister when their father died in 1847; at the age of twelve she went to work in a cotton mill in Lowell, Massachusetts. In the ensuing decade she moved to New York City, graduated from the New York Normal College and became a teacher, and married a radical lawyer, Lyman Case, whom she later divorced. Late in the 1850s she lived at Stephen Pearl Andrews's co-operative Unity House, where she met her second husband, the social radical Edward Howland.Trahair, p. 191. Howland was noteworthy in that she \\"actually lived in three utopian communities of very different size and denomination....\\"Nan Bowman Albinski, \\"Utopia Reconsidered: Women Novelists and Nineteenth-Century Utopian Visions,\\" Signs, Vol. 13 No. 4 (Summer 1988), pp. 830-41; see p. 838. In 1864 she and her second husband lived for a time at the Fourierist \\"Familist√®re\\" established in Guise by the French industrialist and reformer Jean-Baptiste Godin. Howland later used the experience as the subject of her best-known work, Papa's Own Girl (1874), a novel about an American father and daughter living in a comparable fictional establishment in New England. The heroine, Clara Forest, goes on to live a satisfying life as an independent businesswoman. The book was controversial but also a popular success in its day. Later editions altered the title to The Familist√®re. The Howlands returned to the United States after the end of the American Civil War, and in 1868 they settled in Hammonton, New Jersey, where they were part of a circle of radical thinkers and activists in Hammonton and Vineland. (Both towns were another type of planned community, created by a capitalist promoter instead of utopian idealists.)Richard T. T. Forman, Pine Barrens: Ecosystem and Landscape, Piscataway, NJ, Rutgers University Press, 1998; p. 17. Howland was an active journalist throughout her career; she also translated Godin's Solutions sociales (1871) into English as Social Solutions (1886). Howland was an admirer and supporter of Edward Bellamy after the publication of his famous Looking Backward in 1888; conversely, Howland's work has been cited as a possible influence on Bellamy.Daphne Patai, Looking Backward, 1988-1888: Essays on Edward Bellamy, Amherst, MA, University of Massachusetts Press, 1988; pp. 72, 74, 81, 85-7. In the late 1880s and the 1890s Howland was associated with Albert Kimsey Owen's planned community Pacific City in Topolobampo, Mexico.Suzanne Keller, Building for Women, Lexington, MA, Lexington Books, 1981; pp. 7-14.Trahair, p. 301. Howland edited the community's periodical. She left there when the experiment ended in 1894. (Her husband had died in 1890.) Howland spent her final years in one more planned community, Fairhope, founded on Mobile Bay in Alabama in 1894.Paul M. Gaston, Women of Fairhope, Athens, GA, University of Georgia Press, 1984; pp. 19-65.Trahair, pp. 129-30. She became the town's librarian and wrote for its newspaper. She died on September 18, 1921.

The oldest transcriptions indicate that the name was originally *Bƒõƒæana, with the later development of unstressed -ƒõ- > -i-. The suffix -ana generally indicates a Romance or pre-Romance origin, but because the name cannot be explained through Romance roots it is assumed that it is Slavic in origin, possibly derived from the plural demonym *Bƒõƒæane (literally, 'residents of *Bel—äj—å's village'). History The lords of Biljana lived in a building known as Dori≈°ƒçe in the 13th and 14th centuries. Ownership of the building changed frequently over the centuries. During the late 19th century, the national revival movement took hold here; the Lipa Reading and Choral Society in Biljana was the largest in the Gorizia Hills.

It has a rail station, on a line from Katowice to Skalite.  History  The village was first mentioned in documents in 1477, when Polish King Kazimierz Jagiello≈Ñczyk argued with Hungarian King Matthias Corvinus over the shape of the border between the two nations. In 1706, Franciszek Wielopolski opened here a folwark, calling it Wƒôgierska G√≥rka. In 1838 Adam Wielopolski founded here ironworks, and two years later, a blast furnace was completed. At that time, Wƒôgierska G√≥rka belonged to the Austrian province of Galicia, which was the result of the Partitions of Poland. After a few years, the Wƒôgierska G√≥rka Ironworks became one of the largest such enterprises in Galicia. In 1884, Wƒôgierska G√≥rka received a rail connection with other locations, and the village quickly grew in size and population. In the Second Polish Republic, Wƒôgierska G√≥rka became a popular winter sports center, and a mountain spa. In September 1939, the village was the site of the Battle of Wƒôgierska G√≥rka. Polish defensive fortifications, built before World War II, can still be found and visited here. In 1961 the population of the village was 2,215.

He coxed the eight from Ratzeburg to European gold in 1965, and the first \\"Deutschland Achter\\" in 1966 to world gold. He had to leave his coxing seat because he could not maintain his weight at the required 50 kg any longer. In 1973 he returned to the German eight; this time as a rower. This team came in fifth place at the 1973 European Rowing Championships in Moscow and terminated Niehusen's ambitions for the eight. From 1974 to 1976 he and his partner Ralph Kubail in the coxless pair joined Hans-Johann F√§rber (gold Olympics 1972, in the so-called Bulls-Four) in the coxed four with a different fourth men each year. In 1974 it was Peter-Michael Kolbe, who would become famous as a single sculler. In 1975, it was Dieter Knief, and in 1976 it was Siegfried Fricke. This boat won three consecutive bronze medals, only being beaten by East Germany and the Soviet Union. Niehusen was team captain of the German rowing team. Niehusen worked in the cigarette industry for almost 20 years as a member of the management board of Reemtsma Cigarettenfabriken.

For its success at the World Championships, team members were awarded the title and medal Honoured Master of Sports. After a break from the sport, he came second at the East German national championships in 1969 with the eight from TSC Berlin, beaten for first place by ASK Vorw√§rts Rostock. From this team, a coxed four was formed for the 1969 European Rowing Championships in Klagenfurt, and they won the silver medal behind West Germany. The same team came second at the 1970 East German national championships, beaten by rowers from ASK Vorw√§rts Rostock. In 1971, Wenzel defected and joined RK Am Baldeneysee Essen. In 1971, his first season at the new club, he became national champion with the coxed four. For the 1972 rowing season, he changed to the eight and the team won silver at the national championships. In 1973, the rowing eight from Essen became German champion. In 1974, he was back coxing the four for Essen, and they became German champion. For the 1975 World Rowing Championships in Nottingham, he was the cox for four rowers from different clubs, and this team won a bronze medal after the Soviet Union and East Germany. Most of Wenzel's team members changed for the 1976 season, but the new composition once again won the national championships. He also coxed an eight at the national championships, and that boat came second. West Germany qualified a coxed four for the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal and further changes to the rowing team composition were made. That team won the bronze medal in the coxed four event. At the 1977 World Rowing Championships in Amsterdam, Wenzel coxed the eight that won the bronze medal. In 1978, he coxed an eight that came second at the national championships. The exact same team won the silver medal, behind East Germany, at the 1978 World Rowing Championships in Cambridge, New Zealand. He finished his international career with his appearance in New Zealand. At the national championships in 1979, Wenzel came second with the coxed four, and third with the eight. The same eight went to the 1979 World Rowing Championships in Bled where they came ninth. He had been ill for several years before he died on 24 August 2020.

He formed part of the first British embassy to China, and rose to the rank of General. He became estranged from the majority of his family and spent much of his life in self-imposed exile on the Continent. He is perhaps best known for a painting of him as a child by Sir Joshua Reynolds. Early life Crewe was the son of John Crewe (1742‚Äì1829) of Crewe Hall, a wealthy Whig politician who was created the first Baron Crewe in 1806. His mother, Frances Anne Crewe, the daughter of Fulke Greville, was a political hostess known for her great beauty. His younger sister, Elizabeth Emma (1780‚Äì1850), married Foster Cunliffe-Offley; two other siblings, Richard and Frances, did not survive infancy. As a child in around 1775, he was painted by Sir Joshua Reynolds in a pose and costume which mimic the well-known portrait of Henry VIII by Hans Holbein the Younger. The portrait is considered among the artist's finest portrayals of children, and has been described as \\"one of Reynolds' freshest attempts at comedy painting\\".Wind, Edgar. (1938) \\"Borrowed attitudes\\" in Reynolds and Hogarth. Journal of the Warburg Institute 2: 182‚Äì185 Horace Walpole commented: \\"Is not there humour and satire in Sir Joshua's reducing Holbein's swaggering and colossal haughtiness of Henry VIII to the boyish jollity of Master Crewe?\\"Anecdotes of Painting in England (Warnum, ed.), Vol. I, p. xvii, 1888. Quoted in Wind, 1938 Frances Burney described him in the early 1790s as \\"a silent and reserved, but, I think, sensible young man\\".Burney, Frances. Memoirs of Doctor Burney (Vol. III), p. 155 (Moxon; 1832) Local historian Ray Gladden describes him at the time of his entrance into the army as \\"high spirited\\", accruing gambling debts that his father had to pay off by selling land. One of his daughters later remembered that he claimed his total debts were never above ¬£80,000, then a huge sum. Army career Crewe entered the army in the 1790s. In 1793, when he held the rank of a lieutenant, he was a member of the Macartney Embassy to China, led by Lord Macartney, who was his mother's cousin. Crewe rose to the rank of Major-General in 1808, Lieutenant- General in 1813 and full General in 1830, before retiring in 1831. He lost the sight in one eye during active service. Marriage and children Crewe Hall On 5 May 1807, he married Henrietta Maria Anna Walker-Hungerford,co-heiress by her grandmother's father's family of the estate of George Hungerford (1637‚Äì1712) daughter of George Walker of Studleigh house (now demolished), near Calne in Wiltshire. She was the heiress to a substantial fortune derived from Barbados sugar plantations. The couple had four children, three daughters, Henrietta Mary (1808‚Äì79), Maria Hungerford (who died in infancy) and Annabella Hungerford (1814-1874), and a son, Hungerford (1812‚Äì94). According to Gladden, the marriage was not a happy one. Gladden states that Crewe contracted a second bigamous marriage in 1820, which was carried out at the chapel at the family seat of Crewe Hall and officiated over by a billiard- maker.Gladden, Ray. Calmic at Crewe Hall, p. 28 (Medica Packaging; 2005) This second marriage resulted in an illegitimate daughter. Henrietta Crewe died in 1820, aged 48. The couple's three surviving children, aged between six and eleven, became wards of court, and lived with Lord Crewe at Crewe Hall. Hungerford Crewe was eccentric as a child, and is said to have seen little of his father. A family history written by Robert Crewe-Milnes, 1st Marquess of Crewe, states that John Crewe regarded his only son with \\"nothing but contempt\\". Life abroad Crewe lived abroad for many years while he was in the army and after his retirement. In 1817, he was imprisoned in France after being falsely accused of owing 23,945 francs to a hotel-keeper. The Times quotes the French newspaper The Moniteur: On his father's death in 1829, he became the second Baron Crewe. Gladden states that his father cut him out of his will, so far as was possible. Crewe Hall and the rental income from the Crewe family's large estates in Cheshire and Staffordshire were inherited by his sister, Elizabeth Cunliffe-Offley.Gladden, p. 29 Small bequests were left to John Crewe's daughters. Lord Crewe never subsequently lived at Crewe Hall. By this date he was living at the chateau Bois l'-Ev√®que, near Li√®ge in Belgium. His younger daughter, Annabella, went to live with the Cunliffe- Offleys in Madeley, resulting in a permanent breach between her and her father. She married Richard Monckton Milnes in 1851. His older daughter, Henrietta, moved to Belgium to live with her father, and subsequently converted to Roman Catholicism. She returned to England after her father's death and never married, maintaining an establishment for many years in the grounds of Prior Park, Bath. Lord Crewe died at Bois l'Ev√®que in 1835, and is buried at Barthomley, Cheshire, where the family chapel is located. He was succeeded by his son, Hungerford Crewe. Hungerford Crewe inherited Crewe Hall and the Crewe family estates two years later.

Groups also compete, under supervision, in group battles which may approximate historically real combat, using SCA approved safe weapons. Combats are performed under the watch of marshals to maintain safety. It is variously considered a combat sport, contact sport, or a form of martial art.

Armour  All armour standards are codified, with slight variations between the different regional groups within the SCA. All vital points are covered by some hard rigid protection. Safety standards are high and generally well enforced, with few serious injuries in comparison to other sports. Steel is generally used for armour (though aluminum, leather and even plastic or carpet may be used if they are covered over). There are a number of armourers that supply the SCA and other living history groups, but many make their own armour, while some participants may import armour from overseas. Armour is generally encouraged to look like its historical counterpart, though differences are often necessary to comply with safety requirements, and sometimes modern sport armour may be used\\"A nice knight to fight for fantasy\\", Daniella Miletic, Oct 10, 2004, The Age One of the most common examples is the face of a helmet: While many types of historical helm had no face protection, safety rules require full coverage of the head. As a result, there are many variations of helm used in the SCA that are otherwise historically accurate but have a steel grill added to cover the face. These grilled faceplates were also used for tournaments in Europe in the 14th and 15th Centuries, although probably not for actual warfare. Armour costs can vary greatly from DIY, donation, used armour, or spending up to thousands for museum quality armour, and may weigh as much as 70 pounds.  Rules  Fighters practicing at Gulf Wars XIII (2004) In SCA heavy combat, the validity of a blow received is judged on an honour system. The combatant receiving a blow from a SCA-approved weapon judges if they would have been uninjured, injured, or killed had it been a historically real weapon impacting a universal \\"imaginary\\" set of SCA specified armour that all combatants \\"wear\\". This set of default armour balances valid blow/hit levels and helps to eliminate differences created by the armour combatants are actually wearing. This \\"imaginary\\" armour set consists of mail hauberk, an open-faced helmet with a nasal (nose protection), and boiled leather armour about the arms and legs. Blows with sufficient force are judged by combatants to have been deflected, defeated, or penetrated this style of armour, or if struck on an \\"unprotected\\" area of the body. Depending on these several variables a combatant judges the level of damage ranging from no damage to instant death and responds according to SCA norms and rules. Combatants varying from SCA combat norms and rules are normally frowned upon because they could potentially compromise safety, fun, and reflect badly on the honor of SCA combatants. The effect a blow has on a combatant is determined by a body part target location system. If the head, neck or torso are hit with significant force, the combatant is deemed dead. If a leg is hit with significant force to disable it, the combatant must fight on his or her knees thereafter. If an arm is hit, the combatant can no longer use it to hold a weapon or shield. Different weapons can have different effects, simulating the effect of the period weapon (e.g. a mace hit upon the shoulder has a more severe effect than a sword, to simulate the effect of the mace as a heavier weapon). The struck combatant either verbally acknowledges the validity of a blow or acts it out, depending on the type of bout. Some bouts request a defeated combatant die a dramatic death for good showmanship. Certain combat moves and styles are prohibited for safety reasons; even if they would have occurred in real historical combat because they could present major safety issues for modern SCA practitioners. Grades, in the form of Knighthoods, are awarded to those of sufficient prowess. Women are awarded knighthoods as well, and there are currently around 40 female knighthoods in the society.Georgina Connery \\"Combatants put mettle to the test\\" Canberra Times Canberra Times, Nov 30, 2014, p8  Competitions  SCA tournaments are held regularly in which two combatants fight each other,Camelot Lives. Time, 0040781X, 10/9/1972, Vol. 100, Issue 15 using a number of advancement systems so that a single winning fighter is decided. A special case of this is the regular Crown Tournament in each SCA kingdom held to choose the king and queen who will \\"rule\\". Melee tournaments can include a number of combatants taking to the field. Especially at large events such as Pennsic War, combats may include wars, where large number of participants can take the field at once, and these may include archers, artillery and fortifications. Sometimes, novelty combat may occur, where for instance, the fighters take the form of chess pieces. Pennsic field battle in 2006  Training  Most local SCA groups hold \\"fighter practices\\" where individual and group combat is practiced and informal instruction occurs, but in some regions there may be more formalized and structured training in a local style. Typically several years of direct experience in heavy combat are needed to excel in tournaments. Experienced fighters often train less-experienced fighters in a Knight / squire relationship.  Fighting styles  Unlike many other martial arts, there is no general formal style or codified system within SCA heavy combat, and individuals may fight whatever style and type of weapon that are permissible within the rules. Styles and strategies are often passed on within local groups based on either the individual style of a local trainer, who is normally an experienced fighter known as a \\"Knight\\" or a \\"Peer\\", the style of the local group as a whole, or the style of a particular household. Criticism There a number of issues where SCA armoured combat is sometimes criticized, including: The \\"honour system\\" * An identical blow thrown, with identical force, may be taken as valid by one fighter, but not another. This could be because the two fighters come from different regions, and therefore expectation regarding valid force. To mitigate this, it is typical to have fighters warm up before a formal bout by mutually exchanging hits and providing feedback, called \\"calibrating\\". However a fighter's perception of a hit is also affected by armour type and location, the normal variation in human perception to pressure and pain, fatigue, and battle focus. * Bouts are overseen by marshals, but they are prohibited from judging if a blow was valid from their perspective. They can however temporarily stop a bout to provide descriptive information of past hits to the combatants and reaffirm the concepts of the honour system before the bout is resumed. Such a pause can help restore a balance of judgement between combatants. * Despite the above, it is possible for a fighter to \\"cheat\\" by not acknowledging a disabling hit in order to win a bout. However, if an individual fighter demonstrates a blatant hit judgement problem then they will acquire a reputation for being a dishonorable combatant, (a \\"rhinohide\\"), with the attendant social stigma - and may find that others will not fight them. The mixture of periods * Each fighter's persona and armour is chosen from a wide time period (circa 600‚Äì1600), and a wide geographic area, so combatants can seem wildly mismatched in terms of armour and style. As noted above, for the purposes of judging valid blows, participants are \\"deemed\\" to be wearing simple nasal helm and mail, so whatever the visible mismatch, it should have little effect on their respective competitiveness. Authenticity * In general, fighters use techniques and moves that work, rather than trying to replicate what we know of historical combat, or of what was taught about it at the time. * Unlike real combat, fighters are not allowed to target certain areas, such as the hands, or the knees and below - or to use wrestling techniques or throws. * However, SCA armour and weapon standards mean that combat can be safely full speed and target the head, including thrusts to the face, that would be used in real combat - but that many other combat/reenactment systems would not allow.

Like St Pancras and Islington Cemetery (which is nearby) it is a cemetery located in the London Borough of Barnet but is owned by another borough: the facilities are owned and managed by the City of Westminster.East Finchley Cemetery (City of Westminster) accessed 26 January 2006 History and characteristics The St Marylebone Burial Board purchased of Newmarket Farm in 1854; and the cemetery, then known as St Marylebone Cemetery, was laid out by architects Barnett & Birch after winning a competition. Principal features are two Lebanon Cedar trees planted on the front lawn. The crematorium was opened in 1937 and is now owned by The London Cremation Company (which also owns Golders Green Crematorium, Woking Crematorium, Banbury Crematorium in Banbury, The Garden of England Crematorium in Sittingbourne and Thames View Crematorium and Cemetery in Gravesend). Due to local government reorganisation, the cemetery was managed by the Metropolitan Borough of St Marylebone - from 1900; and became the responsibility of the City of Westminster in 1965, when the cemetery became known by its current name. The cemetery contains about 22,000 interments; and remains open for burials. The cemetery was awarded a Green Flag Award in 2007, 2008 and 2009. It is also a Site of Local Importance for Nature Conservation. The cemetery became a point of controversy in the early nineties when the then Leader of Westminster City Council and one of the councillors wanted the cemetery to be sold (to avoid the substantial upkeep). The cemetery also included a considerable amount of land being used at the time for plant propagation for horticultural use throughout the City of Westminster; it also provided housing for the Cemetery Keeper. After much argument at Council Meetings and against the advice of the Chief Officers concerned, the cemetery was sold, the transaction then became part of the Westminster cemeteries scandal. The cemetery contains a number of structures listed on the National Heritage List for England.

He was born in a poor weaver family in Germany. He moved to India as the director of the Lutheran Leipzig Mission in 1849 and there he mastered Tamil. Graul was one of the foremost figures in missiology. His approach towards caste system was considered to be too lenient by his critics since he considered that caste system would fade on its own accord and Christian organizations need not interfere with local traditions. He also advocated the supremacy of Lutheranism over other Christian denominations and found it hard to cooperate with Anglicans in India. Early life Karl Graul was born in W√∂rlitz, Duchy of Anhalt, into a poor weaver's family. In spite of his poor background he received good education in classical and modern languages as well as in theology. However, as for as mission and missiology is concerned he was entirely self-taught.Biographical Dictionary of Christian Missions p. 257 Tamil scholar Karl Graul was appointed the director of the Lutheran Leipzig Mission in 1844. The Lutheran mission had succeeded the Danish-Hale mission in South India. During his stay in India, Graul mastered the Tamil language. After returning to Leipzig in 1853 he taught Tamil language and literature at the mission house.The Triumph of Confessionalism in Nineteenth- Century German Lutheran Missions p. 80 Later Graul wrote Bibilotheca Tamulica seu Opera Praecipua Tamuliensium (1854‚Äì1865). A work in 4 volumes, it contains in its third and fourth volumes the first complete translation of the Tirukkural in Latin, German, and the standard spoken Tamil with notes and glossaries. It was published by his student Wilhelm Germann the year after Graul's death in Erlangen. Graul also wrote a Tamil Grammar in German (1855). Missiology Graul being one of the foremost figures in missiology, insisted that other missionaries should go through academic training both in mission as well in theology. He insisted that the knowledge of locals with contextual approach towards indigenous churches. Views on caste system Graul's views on caste system was considered by his critics as \\"too lenient\\". This was in light that Madras Missionary Conference resolved that no one should be admitted to baptism until he had shed off the caste identity and breaks the caste by eating food prepared by a person from the lower caste. According to Stephen Neill all Protestant missionary societies agreed to these terms except for Graul's Leipzig Evangelical Lutheran Mission. This was since Graul believed that caste system can be removed only as a slow processChristianity and African Culture p.24 and making it mandatory is not needed.A History of Christianity in India p. 407 It was his view that missionaries should not interfere with indigenous social orders unless they are wholly incompatible with the Gospel.Christianity and African Culture p.23 Supremacy of Lutheranism Graul believed in supremacy of Lutheranism over other Christian denominations. Thus he found it hard on mutual cooperation with Anglicans in India especially on communion.A History of Christianity in India p. 396 Death Graul in 1864 qualified himself as a university lecturer in missiology at Erlangen. However, he died the same year even before taking up the position. Works * √úbersetzung von Dante Allghieri's G√∂ttlicher Kom√∂die; 1843.

It is located south of Junction 42 of the A14 providing primary access to adjacent market towns Bury St Edmunds (East) and Newmarket (West). The village consists of two central roads: Fornham Lane and Hill Road running north and south through the parish, with adjoining roads accommodating Westley‚Äôs total population of 183. Village facilities include: Westley Club, located on Old church Lane and refurbished in 2012 to include pool tables and a community staffed bar, it is the village's only social venue. St Mary's Church, a pioneering concrete structure which features a three-phase tower with (nowadays) a slated pyramidal roof acts as the village's focal point. History=Early history= The earliest indication of the village's existence derives from 'a document of around 1040'. Westley later appeared in the 1086 Domesday Book under the name 'Westlea' meaning 'westerly wood or clearing'. The Doomsday Book recorded the village as having 21 households and a total tax assessment of 3.3 geld units suggesting that the area was of average affluence. 'St Thomas the Martyr Church' was the village's first church, constructed in the 12th century after St Thomas of Canterbury. Its site is on the Western limit of the modern village, and is maintained as a quiet place for contemplation. The church suffered severe storms in 1844 and 1789, despite attempts by churchwardens to repair the building in the early 19th century, pillage of the stonework and the conclusion that the structure is beyond repair led to its closure in 1834. The closure of St Thomas church led to the construction of St Marys Church in 1835, noted as 'one of the earliest concrete buildings to have been built in England.' The construction of the church was funded by public subscription on land given by Frederick Hervey, 1st Marquess of Bristol and incorporated innovative architectural techniques implemented by Brighton builder 'William Ranger'. Notable aesthetic features of St Marys Church include the slate roof and patented precast concrete blocks used to form the tower and churchyard walls. In 1870‚Äì72, [John Marius Wilson] described Westley as: :\\"Westley, a parish in Thingoe district, Suffolk; 2 miles W by S of Bury-St. Edmunds r. station. Post town, Bury-St. Edmunds. Acres 1,216. Real property, ¬£1,553. Pop., 140. Houses, 29. The manor belongs to the executors of J. Lee, Esq. The living is a rectory, annexed to Fornham. The church was built in 1836\\" =20th century= Westley was bombed by a Zeppelin airship during the First World War, the village formed part of LZ 37 Zeppelin's flight path from Great Yarmouth on the night of 29 April 1915; there were no fatalities. Westley airfield was built in 1938. Consisting of two hangars and a relatively short runway, it predominately flew Westland Lysanders. Similar to much of Westley's periphery, the airfield now forms part of a housing estate to accommodate Bury St Edmunds's growth. The shrinking of the area of the parish is credited to the loss of the three manors: Sexton Manor; which has now formed part of Bury St Edmunds, Pembroke (Dunham Hall) and Luce's (Leo's) Hall. In 1959 St Mary Church's buttressed spire was damaged by detrimental weather conditions, and was replaced by the current pyramidal roof on the church tower. =Manors = Westley had three manors. Sextons Manor which is now part of Bury St Edmunds. Pembroke (or Dunham Hall) which is thought to have stood near what is now Parson's Barn and Luce's (or Leo's) Hall was situated where Westley Hall now stands. In the reign of Henry VII of England Pembroke Manor was held by the King's uncle Jasper Tudor. Thomas Lucas (Solicitor General to Henry VII) (Solicitor General for England and Wales) held Luces Hall in the village. It maybe that the spelling has over time been corrupted and was in fact Lucas Hall. Jasper Tudor (Earl of Pembroke) bequeathed Pembroke Hall to his long time friend Thomas Lucas. The Lucas Family therefore owned two of the three Westley Manors. Thomas Lucas increased his local land holding by purchasing properties at nearby Little Saxham (where he built a fine Manor House) and Horsecroft. Demographics=Population= Census of Population from 1881 to 2011 The earliest record of Westley's population appeared in the 1068 Domesday book, the population is recorded as 21 households(population was measured by heads of families because The Domesday Book was written predominately for the assessment of tax) assuming average family size is 4 the total population in 1068 was approximately 84 which is relatively large compared to neighbouring settlements. The earliest record of Westley's population in the national census is 1801, with a total population of 88. The population grew by an average of 14 persons every 10 years between 1811 and 1841. There are two significant population decreases on the adjacent time series: 1841‚Äì1851; which correlates to a reduction of 3 houses in the village during such years, and 1931 ‚Äì 1951; which can be interpreted by a boundary change of 1240 to 685 acres between those years with much of the population being absorbed into Bury St Edmunds. The 2001 census recorded a total population of 189 and in 2011 the census recorded a small drop to 183, giving Westley a population density of 0.5 persons per hectare, this is 8 times less than the average population density of England suggesting that Westley is a sparse settlement in comparison. =Employment= Percentage of males working in agriculture time series, as reported by the 1831, 1881 occupational data and the 2001, 2011 census. Historical statistics from the 1881 occupational data demonstrate the importance of agriculture in Westley during the 19th century. In 1881, 76% (32 out of 40) of Westley's total male workforce was in the Agriculture category compared to 0% (out of 46) in the 2011 census. Westley Occupation Statistics, as reported by 2011 Census According to the 2011 Census, there are 87 people aged 16‚Äì74 in employment in Westley, the most frequent occupational group is 'Professional Occupations' with a total of 22 persons(25.3%), this is reflective of the affluence of the area, demonstrated by the 'All households who owned their accommodation outright' figure which is double the national average. Transport The village of Westley forms part of the Bury St Edmunds ‚Äì Barrow ‚Äì Newmarket 312 service operated by Mulleys. Westley's bus stops are positioned adjacent and opposite St Marys Church, Hill Road. Buses run every two hours Monday to Saturday with no Sunday service. Junction 42 of the A14, 0.6 miles (1 km) north of Westley links the village to larger settlements such as Bury St Edmunds (Eastbound) or Newmarket (Westbound). The conjoining roads Fornham Lane and Hill Road provide access through the centre of the village. Westley is served by Bury St Edmunds railway station, 2.4 miles (3.9 km) away. Services are managed by Abellio Greater Anglia and form part of the Peterborough ‚Äì Ipswich and Cambridge ‚Äì Ipswich Lines.

As part of the BIOS of such mainboards, AGESA is responsible for the initialization of the processor cores, memory, and the HyperTransport controller. AGESA was open sourced in early 2011, aiming to aid in the development of coreboot, a project attempting to replace PC's BIOS. However, such releases never became the basis for the development of coreboot beyond AMD's family 15h, as they were subsequently halted. History AGESA became particularly relevant with the AM4 platform, which AMD designed for futureproofing, and as of May 2019 has served as the base for three different generations of CPUs based on its Zen architecture. For each of these generations, a new branch of AGESA code has been released. AGESA versioning often runs separately for each of these three releases, so numbering regressions are bound to happen when going from one generation to the next. The first version, named \\"Summit PI\\", launched in February 2017. It was targeted at the first generation Zen chips, and started with version 1.0.0.4. In December 2017, when Summit PI reached version 1.0.0.7, it the Summit PI branch was renamed to \\"Raven PI\\" (its version numbering was not reset), and it was released as the first version of AGESA to support Raven Ridge APUs. The second version, supporting the Zen's second generation, known as Zen+, is named \\"Pinnacle PI\\", after the Ryzen processors' codename, Pinnacle Ridge. It launched in February 2018 with an initial version of 1.0.0.0a.

Located around two miles north of Bury St Edmunds, its 2005 population was 50. At the 2011 Census the appropriate Postal Code (IP31 1HS) showed the population as being included in Ampton. History The village name is Old English for ‚ÄòTima‚Äôs Enclosure‚Äô and was mentioned in the Doomesday Book as Timeworda located in the hundred of Thedwastre. The Domesday Book records the population of Timworth in 1086 as 38 households along with 6 acres of meadows. The land was held by Bury St Edmunds Abbey and Richard fitz Gilbert, before the Norman conquest of England the lands were held by the Abbey and Wihtgar son of Aelfric. There are two listed buildings in the parish; the grade II listed Green Farmhouse and the grade II* listed Church of St Andrew. Grade II listed Green Farmhouse =Prosecutions for gleaning= Over the harvests of 1785‚Äì1787, conflict escalated between land owners and gleaners in the village. The first case was brought against Timworth shoemaker Benjamin Manning, by farmer John Worlledge in 1786, who gleaned in neighbouring Ingham. The court held that the defendant was not an inhabitant of the parish in which he gleaned, and was not entitled to the gleaning support. The court therefore decided that a stranger had no right to glean. Worlledge was awarded ¬£26 in damages.Suffolk Record Office, Bury St Edmunds FL641/9/1. Timworth Parish Constables' account book 1779-1839 The main advocate for the gleaners was Capel Lofft, Justice of the Peace, who had recently inherited the nearby halls at Stanton and Troston. The second and more widely impacting case came in 1788 when Mary Houghton, the wife of James a shoemaker and one of Timworth's last remaining freeholders, gleaned on the farm of James Steel, who subsequently sued for trespass. The court found in favour of Steel awarding him ¬£35 5s, and ruled that no person has a right at common law to glean the harvest of a private field. The judgement was taken to be a more general precedent for private land matters. The case was widely reported and became known as The Great Gleaning Case. The subsequent debts and hardship that the case brought to the Houghtons forced them to twice mortgage then in 1796 auction their smallholding, which was one of the few remaining parts of the Culford estate parishes not yet under the control of the 1st Marquess Cornwallis. Its purchase almost certainly enabled him to complete the enclosure process and to bring to fruition his family's long-term plans to make it a closed parish and classic estate village. =Historical writings= In 1870‚Äì72, John Marius Wilson's Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales described the village as '' In 1887, John Bartholomew also wrote an entry on Timworth in the Gazetteer of the British Isles with a much shorter description: '' Notable residents *Edward Ward, clergyman and cricketer ReferencesExternal links *STEEL against HOUGHTON ET UXOR. 1788 * Villages in Suffolk Civil parishes in Suffolk Borough of St Edmundsbury ","title":"Timworth"},{"id":"21264412","text":"Knettishall is a village and civil parish in the West Suffolk district of Suffolk in eastern England.

Aris Konstantinidis was born in Athens and studied architecture at the Technical University of Munich from 1931 to 1936, where he came into contact with the Modern Movement in architecture. He returned to Greece in 1936 and worked for the Town Planning Department of the city of Athens and for the Ministry of Public Works. He was appointed head of the Workers Housing Organisation from 1955 to 1975 and from 1957 to 1967 of the Technical Service of the Greek National Tourism Organisation, where he planned and oversaw the construction of a series of workers' houses and Xenia hotels. At the same time, Konstantinidis planned and realised several private projects like the emblematic Weekend House in Anavyssos.Giamarelos, S. (2014).

DOI: http://doi.org/10.5334/ah.bx He devoted extensive study to the anonymous architecture of Greece and between 1947 and 1953 published three books in which he examined particular examples of this type of architecture. In 1975 he published a comprehensive book concerning the anonymous architecture of Greece, entitled Elements of Self-knowledge: Towards a true architecture, in which it is apparent how much he was influenced by the architectural tradition of his homeland and how he drew lessons from the past to develop an architecture for his time. In his last book, entitled Theoktista (\\"God- built\\"), the architect once again underlined his belief that anonymous architecture as well as the landscape of Greece itself constituted the foundations on which modern architectural practice could and should be grounded. He taught at the Zurich Polytechnic as a visiting professor. In 1978 he received an honorary doctorate from the University of Thessaloniki. He was appointed a corresponding member of the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich. Through his work, Aris Konstantinidis created architectural solutions unique in Greece, which gave birth to a modern Greek architecture.  Personal life  In 1951 Konstantinidis married the famous Greek sculptor Natalia Mela. They had two children: Dimitris Konstantinidis is also an architect and Alexandra Tsoukala is a light designer.

Although it is self- acting, it has to be stopped to recharge empty shuttles. It was the mainstay of the Lancashire cotton industry for a century. John Bullough John Bullough (1800‚Äì1868) was from Accrington, often described as a simple-minded Westhoughton weaver. Originally a handloom weaver, unlike others of his trade Bullough embraced new developments such as Edmund Cartwright's power loom (1785). While colleagues were busy rejecting new devices such as in the power- loom riots that broke out in Lancashire in 1826, Bullough improved his own loom by inventing various components, including the \\"self-acting temple\\" that kept the woven cloth at its correct width, and a loose reed that allowed the lathe to back away on encountering a shuttle trapped in the warp. Bullough also invented a simple but effective warning device which rang a bell every time a warp thread broke on his loom. Bullough moved to Blackburn and worked with William Kenworthy at Brookhouse Mills, with whom he applied his inventions to develop an improved power loom that later became known as the \\"Lancashire Loom\\". He was forced to quit Blackburn, for fear of angry handloom weavers. He later settled in Accrington to form Howard & Bullough in partnership with John Howard at Globe Works, alongside the Leeds-Liverpool Canal in Accrington. Here he invented the slasher, which founded the company's success. He was one of the country's largest manufacturers. At the height of the business the Globe works employed almost 6000 workers and covered . 75% of production was exported. Howard and Bullough became part of the Textile Machinery Makers Limited group, which were bought out by Platt, and in 1991 the company name changed to Platt Saco Lowell. The Globe works closed in 1993. The Loom Marsdens:1892 diagram 1894 Lancashire Looms (Harling & Todd) still in use at Queen Street Mill, Burnley. From 1830 there had been a series of incremental improvements to the basic Roberts Loom. * Richard Roberts 1830, Roberts Loom. These improvements were a geared take up wheel and tappets to operate multiple heddles * Stanford, Pritchard and Wilkinson ‚Äì patented a method to stop on the break of weft or warp. It was not used. * William Dickinson of Blackburn Blackburn Loom the modern overpick loom There now appear a series of useful improvements that are contained in patents for useless devices * Hornby, Kenworthy and Bullough of Blackburn 1834 ‚Äì the vibrating or fly reed * John Ramsden and Richard Holt of Todmorden 1834 ‚Äì a new automatic weft stopping motion * John Bullough of Blackburn 1835 ‚Äì improved automatic weft stopping motion and taking up and letting off arrangements * Andrew Parkinson 1836 ‚Äì improved stretcher (temple). * William Kenworthy and James Bullough 1841 ‚Äì trough and roller temple (became the standard), A simple stop-motion. At this point the loom has become fully automatic, this is the Kenworthy and Bullough Lancashire Loom. The Cartwight loom weaver could work one loom at 120‚Äì130 picks per minute- with a Kenworthy and Bullough's Lancashire Loom, a weaver can run up to six looms working at 220‚Äì260 picks per minute- thus giving 12 times more throughput. The power loom is now referred to as \\"a perfect machine\\", it produced textile of a better quality than the hand weaver for less cost. An economic success. Other improvements were the * John Bullough 1842 ‚Äì the loose reed, which doubled the operating speed * John Sellers 1845 ‚Äì Burnley Brake, a loom brake * Blackburn 1852 ‚Äì Dickinson Loom Modern overpick- or side pick using the cone and bowl that substituted the lever pick. Invented in Dickinson's mill. =Movements= The three primary movements of a loom are shedding, picking, and beating-up. :*Shedding: The operation of dividing the warp into two lines, so that the shuttle can pass between these lines. There are two general kinds of sheds: \\"open\\" and \\"closed\\". Open Shed-The warp threads are moved when the pattern requires it-from one line to the other. Closed Shed-The warp threads are all placed level in one line after each pick. :*Picking: The operation of projecting the shuttle from side to side of the loom through the division in the warp threads. This is done by the overpick or underpick motions. The overpick is suitable for quick-running looms, whereas the underpick is best for heavy or slow looms. :*Beating-up: The third primary movement of the loom when making cloth, and is the action of the reed as it drives each pick of weft to the fell of the cloth. Economics The principal advantage of the Lancashire loom was that it was semi-automatic, when a warp thread broke the weaver was notified. When the shuttle ran out of thread, the machine stopped. An operative thus could work 4 or more looms whereas previously they could only work a single loom. Indeed, the term A Four Loom Weaver was used to describe the operatives. Labour cost was quartered. In some mills an operative would operate 6 or even 8 looms, although that was governed by the thread being used. By 1900, the loom was challenged by the Northrop Loom, which was fully automatic and could be worked in larger numbers. The Northrop was suitable for coarse thread but for fine cotton, the Lancashire loom was still preferred. By 1914, Northop looms made up 40% of looms in American mills, but in the United Kingdom labour costs were not as significant and they only supplied 2% of the British market.

Many famous composers and their operas are associated with it, including the premieres of Mozart's Mitridate, re di Ponto, Ascanio in Alba, and Lucio Silla. The opera house also saw the premiere of Maria Teresa Agnesi Pinottini's Ciro in Armenia in 1753; one of the earliest successfully received operas by a female composer. The variant form Regio Ducal Teatro is also seen. The atmosphere in opera houses at the time was very sociable and congenial, and the Teatro Regio Ducale was no exception. The English traveller and music writer Charles Burney describes its faro tables for gambling, and gives this description: > The theatre here is very large and splendid; it has five rows of boxes on > each side, one hundred in each row; and parallel to these runs a broad > gallery ... as an avenue to every row of boxes: each box will contain six > persons, who sit at the sides, facing each other. Across the gallery of > communications is a complete room to every box, with a fireplace in it, and > all conveniences for refreshments and cards. In the fourth row is a pharo > table, on each side of the house, which is used during the performance of > the opera.Sadie and Zaslaw, pp. 214‚Äì215. After the destruction of the Teatro Regio Ducale, which had been a wing of the Palazzo Reale (Royal Palace), two new theatres were commissioned to be built near the site, both designed by Giuseppe Piermarini. The Nuovo Regio Ducal Teatro alla Scala (with variant forms of its name), the present-day La Scala, was inaugurated on 3 August 1778. The Teatro alla Canobbiana, now called the Teatro Lirico, was inaugurated on 21 August 1779.

The first-class only service was operated by company Unionsexpressen Scandinavian Railway AB, while haulage and Norwegian representation was operated by Ofotbanen. In 2005, the state-owned SJ and Norges Statsbaner (NSB) cooperation Linx closed services on the Oslo‚ÄìStockholm route. The first trial runs of the Unionsexpressen started on 11 April 2008, with regular service commencing on 15 June. Operations were terminated on 7 October, following the bankruptcy of Ofotbanen. Service Unionsexpressen was an all first-class intercity service which operates between Oslo and Stockholm. The express competes with the X2000 service provided by SJ. The latter has a somewhat longer travel time, since it makes more stops along the way. The Unionsexpressen trains were hauled by Ofotbanen-operated Rc-locomotives leased from SJ. Each train had four cars, of which three were open seating, and one was a dining car. The service had higher prices than the SJ service, but instead offers more luxury. The founders stated that the service is inspired by the Orient Express. With a full restaurant on board, fresh-made meals can be purchased, along with beverages. The seating compartments are newly renovated, with wooden interior, three-abreast seating and Wi-Fi. On weekdays, there was a single daily round trip, leaving Oslo in the morning, and returning in the afternoon. On Saturdays, the line only operated from Oslo to Stockholm, and on Sundays only from Stockholm to Oslo. Stops were provided at Lillestr√∏m and Kongsvinger in Norway, and Karlstad, Hallsberg and S√∂dert√§lje in Sweden. Travel time from Oslo to Stockholm was 5 hours and 25 minutes. History With the termination of NSB's and SJ's cooperation Linx on the Oslo‚ÄìStockholm route in January 2005, Ofotbanen announced they would be willing to take over operation of the route from the summer. However, SJ and NSB held monopolies on non-subsidized passenger trains services in their respective countries, and it would not be possible for a private company to operate the route. In May 2007, Ofotbanen announced its plans for the Oslo‚ÄìStockholm train, after necessary permissions had been granted from Norwegian and Swedish authorities, who decided to allow free competition on international routes. By then, SJ had already reopened its route on the line. In March 2008, plans had been launched to start operations in April, but Ofotbanen did not met the requirements to get a safety license from the inspectorates. The company rented rolling stock from SJ, including an Rc locomotives, and newly renovated cars from the 1960s. Lillestr√∏m The necessary certificates were granted on 10 April, and the first trial run was made the following day. Ordinary service started on 25 April, though without the dining car. The initial price was , and travel time was 5 hours 45 minutes. 0 From 15 June, full service was introduced, and the price increased to NOK 593. By July, Ofotbanen had still not found a locomotive for the second train, and was still operating only a single round service. Passenger numbers were at 35 per departure, far from the capacity of 84 and the necessary annual 100,000 needed to make a profit. Following the bankruptcy in Ofotbanen on 7 October, all service was halted. The owners have reestablished Ofotbanen under the new entity Ofotbanen Drift, but SJ has withdrawn the leasing of the locomotive. The service was therefore never re-established.

By 2002, He joined the club's reserve side and three years later, Wohlfarth was promoted to the club's first team ahead of the 2005‚Äì06 season. Lack of first- team opportunities, he joined FC Ingolstadt 04 in 2006. In the 2007‚Äì08 season, the club was promoted to the 2. Bundesliga, where Wohlfarth scored eleven goals in thirty-three appearance. Following the club's promotion in the 2008‚Äì09 season, he made his debut on the professional league level in the 2. Bundesliga for Ingolstadt on 17 August 2008 when he started in a game against Greuther F√ºrth. Having his career resurrected, his Ingolstadt career soon faded and under manager Benno M√∂hlmann, Wohlfarth left the club on 21 December 2010 by mutual consent with immediate effect. On 7 January 2011, Wohlfarth joined Bayern Munich II on a two-year contract. He made his debut on 22 January 2011 in a 2‚Äì0 loss against Wacker Burghausen. Twenty-Four days later after his debut, on 11 February 2011, he scored his first goal, a penalty, in a 2‚Äì1 loss against Carl Zeiss Jena. During the season, Wohlfarth scored six goals for Bayern Munich II but, the club was relegated to the 3. Liga after finishing 20th place. After Bayern Munich II's relegation, Wohlfarth joined SV Wehen Wiesbaden on a two-year contract. He scored twice on his debut, in a 2‚Äì1 win over Werder Bremen II. In his first season, Wohlfarth was used more often in the first team, making thirty-five appearance and scoring ten times. However, the 2012‚Äì13 season was increasingly frustrating for Wohlfarth as his first team opportunities soon became limited by spent time on the bench, in numbers of games and scoring twice. On 2 January 2013, it was announced that Wohlfarth left Wehen Wiesbaden by mutual consent with immediate effect. A week after his release, Wohlfarth joined SPL side Ross County on 21 January 2013 on a short term deal. Nine days later, Wohlfarth made his debut for the club, coming on as a substitute, in a 1‚Äì0 win over Hibernian. He made ten appearances by coming on as a substitute in the second half, including his first goal, which was a winner, in a 3‚Äì2 win over Scottish giants Celtic on 9 March 2013. Several weeks later, on 6 April 2013, Wohlfarth scored twice, as Ross County lost 4‚Äì2 against Hearts. At the end of the 2012‚Äì13 season, Wohlfarth said he might leave the club, citing personal reasons. Having been offered a new contract by the club, Wohlfarth left the club. Following his released from Ross County, Wohlfarth announced his retirement from professional football. In 2013, he joined Oberliga Baden-W√ºrttemberg side FV Ravensburg.

The upper (outbound) platform at left is empty, while the lower (inbound) platform is relatively crowded. A split platform is a station that has a platform for each track, split onto two or more levels. This configuration allows a narrower station plan (or footprint) horizontally, at the expense of a deeper (or higher) vertical elevation, because sets of tracks and platforms are stacked above each other. Where two rails lines cross or run parallel for a time, split platforms are sometimes used in a hybrid arrangement that allows for convenient cross-platform interchange between trains running in the same general direction. Reasons for usage On the London Underground, to minimise the risk of subsidence, the tunnel alignments largely followed the roads on the surface and avoided passing under buildings. If a road was too narrow to allow the construction of side-by-side tunnels, they would be aligned one above the other, so that a number of stations have platforms at different levels. Moreover is very useful if the line branches from the station, since diverting tunnel or tracks do not intersect each other. Examples This setup is not common in North American railroad stations, but is found in places in Europe such as the London Underground on the deep tube lines, namely the Bakerloo, Central, Jubilee, Northern and Piccadilly lines. Examples of split platform layout in the United States are Rosslyn on the Washington Metro's Blue and Orange Lines; Pentagon on the Washington Metro's Blue and Yellow Lines; and Harvard and Porter stations on the Boston-Cambridge MBTA Red Line. Split platforms are also at downtown Oakland, California on BART's 12th and 19th Street stations, as well as in Los Angeles Metro Rail's Wilshire/Vermont station. MARTA's Ashby station uses the configuration to separate the eastbound and westbound platforms. In the New York City Subway, Nostrand Avenue and Kingston Avenue stations on the IRT Eastern Parkway Line have two tracks on each level, with each of the two levels serving trains in one direction. Further north on the Eastern Parkway line, Borough Hall also has split platforms. Also, stations on the IND Eighth Avenue Line have split stacked platforms between 59th Street ‚Äì Columbus Circle and Cathedral Parkway ‚Äì 110th Street due to the proximity of the line to Central Park. In other stations like Fulton Street, Borough Hall, and Fifth Avenue / 53rd Street, platforms are stacked due to the narrowness of the street directly above the station. One notable station, Wilson Avenue on the BMT Canarsie Line, has one elevated platform and one at-grade platform, due to the narrowness of the line's right-of-way. In Canada, split platforms on the Montreal Metro are located at De L'√âglise and Charlevoix and the Blue Line platforms at Jean-Talon, while Snowdon and Lionel-Groulx have a hybrid layout where the two directions on each line are split from each other but sharing an island platform with the other line. They are also found on Vancouver's SkyTrain, at the stations in the Dunsmuir Tunnel and at the King Edward station on the Canada Line. Milan Metro Sant'Agostino on line M2 is similar, and also all the stations between Crocetta and Turati on line M3. On Munich Marienplatz Station the Munich S-Bahn (suburban trains) are on two separate levels, where westbound trains depart from the lower level, eastbound trains from the upper level. Below the westbound level there is an interchange to the metro lines U3 and U6 in North-South direction. In Nuremberg metro network, the station Pl√§rrer has two platforms for cross-platform interchange between lines U1 and U2/U3. The upper platform is used for westbound/outbound services, while the lower one is designated for eastbound/inbound trains. In Hanover light-metro network, Kr√∂pcke has three levels, one for blue lines (3, 7 and 9); SW to NE, one for red lines (1, 2 and 8); NW to SE and one for yellow lines (4, 5, 6 and 11). The red lines level and the yellow lines level are situated directly below each other. An interchange between red and yellow lines is possible at Aegidientorplatz where the underground platforms are situated the same way like N√ºrnberg Pl√§rrer. Eastbound/outbound trains use the lower platform, westbound/inbound trains use the upper one. On Vienna U-Bahn line U3, the stations Neubaugasse, Zieglergasse, Herrengasse, Stephansplatz and Stubentor have two levels of platforms. Trains towards Ottakring (westbound) use the lower platform, trains towards Simmering the upper one. In Stephansplatz the line U1 crosses below these platforms. On the Brussels metro network, a similar arrangement can be found at stations Merode and Weststation (on lines 2 and 6). In Asia, Jingan and Yongan Market on the Taipei Metro have split stacked platforms, and Central, Wan Chai, Causeway Bay, Tin Hau, North Point, and Sai Wan Ho on MTR's Island Line on Hong Kong Island all have split platforms. Ginza-itchome Station on the Tokyo Metro Yurakucho Line has split platforms. Nanpu Bridge Station on line 4 of Shanghai Metro has a split platform. Promenade and Stevens Station in Singapore and Bukit Bintang MRT station in Malaysia also have split side platforms. Sam Yot, Wat Mangkon, Sam Yan, Si Lom, and Lumphini Station on Bangkok MRT Blue Line have split stacked platform. on the KRL Commuterline has split platform which heading to different station on eastbound, but one station on westbound.

As with nearly every other executive branch head in Texas, the Comptroller is popularly elected every four years concurrently with the governor and the other elected executive branch positions (elections take place in even number years not divisible by four; e.g., 2006, 2010, and so on). The current Comptroller is Glenn Hegar, who took office on January 2, 2015. History The predecessor to the current Comptroller's office started in 1846. The longest-serving Comptrollers in Texas history were Robert S. Calvert, who held the post for 26 consecutive years for an unprecedented twelve terms; George H. Sheppard, who served for 18 years over nine two-year terms; and Bob Bullock, who served for 16 years for four four-year terms and later was notable as one of the most powerful Lieutenant Governors in Texas history (and the namesake for the state's official history museum). Duties currently performed by the Comptroller's office were previously divided between it and the office of Texas State Treasurer; however, over time the Texas Legislature transferred most of the Treasurer's functions to the Comptroller's office. The last State Treasurer, Martha Whitehead, successfully campaigned for office in 1994 on the premise of abolishing the position and transferring its few remaining duties to the Comptroller's office; upon winning she successfully campaigned the Legislature for a Constitutional amendment in 1995 to formally abolish the Treasurer's office which was approved by voters in November of that year. By 1996, the Comptroller had taken over the Treasurer's few remaining duties. Duties The primary duty of the Comptroller's office is to collect substantially all tax revenue owed to the State of Texas. This involves more than 60 different types of taxes from the sales tax (the largest source of the state's tax revenue, since Texas does not have a personal income tax) to minor items such as the \\"battery sales fee\\" (a $2‚Äì$3 fee on sales of lead-acid batteries). As Texas uses a unified collection system for sales taxes assessed by both state and local governments, the Comptroller's office is responsible for collecting and remitting the local portion of this tax revenue to the various cities, counties, and special districts throughout the state.\\"Overview of Texas Taxes\\", comptroller's office The Comptroller's office also operates the various prepaid college tuition funds operated by the state through its Prepaid Higher Education Tuition Board, provides reports on fiscal management and economic forecasts, and manages the unclaimed property fund.\\"Texas Finances and Economic Reporting\\", Comptroller's office As part of its fiscal management responsibilities, Article III, Section 49a of the Texas Constitution requires the Comptroller to certify to the Texas Legislature the amount of available cash on hand and anticipated revenues for the next biennium (the two-year period beginning on September 1 of odd-numbered years). The Legislature is not permitted to appropriate any funds in excess of the Comptroller's certified amounts (except in cases of emergency and then only with a four-fifths vote of both chambers), and absent the latter the Comptroller is required to reject and return to the legislature any appropriation in violation of this requirement.

History Construction on the current school building began in late 1995 and finished in early August 1997. Before construction, students at the high school level would attend school at the prior building on Lake Michigan Drive. This building housed all twelve grades under one roof, until decision came that the public school district would vote to build a middle school/high school along 68th Avenue for students in sixth through twelfth grade. The middle school/high school has since become a high school only building with the construction of a new middle school. The high school was constructed of one rural building, with the addition of a high school auditorium and a gym located south of the auditorium. The classroom hallways stretch onto two levels of the northwest section of the school. The school built an auditorium which finished construction on April 16, 2005, naming it the Ceglerek Fine Arts Center (CFAC). Since opening, the CFAC has been home to several wonderful performances. With 789 seats and a spacious stage, the CFAC has the feel of a large auditorium with the intimacy of a small house. In 2003, the district began building brand new athletic facilities, including locker rooms, in the south entrance wing, next to the gymnasium. The athletic department also sponsored a new weight room and student and staff parking lots outside the athletic entrances. With the renovations, the school remodeled the basketball gym and renamed it Coach Ken Pierce Court, after former Allendale basketball coach, Ken Pierce. In 2014, the school remodeled Falcon Stadium outside Allendale High School, replacing the old track with a new rubber track, and a brand new football field.

It is connected with bachata music. Description Basic step In partnering, the lead can decide whether to perform in open, semi-closed or closed position. Dance moves or step variety strongly depend on the music (such as the rhythms played by the different instruments), setting, mood, and interpretation. Unlike salsa, bachata dance does not usually include many turn patterns. Bachata is a social dance from the Dominican Republic in the Caribbean. The basic dance sequence is performed in a full 8-count moving within a square, consisting of three steps and then a tap or various forms of step syncopations (such as the \\"double step\\"). The tap is done on the opposite foot of the last step, while the next step is taken on the same foot as the tap. The dance direction may change after the tap or fourth step. Bachata can be danced on any beat of the musical phrase as long as the basic dance sequence (three steps and then a tap  syncopation) is maintained (for example, one may start on the 1st beat of the musical phrase, with the tap landing on the 4th beat). From the late 1990s and onward, dancers in the Western world started creating novel dance forms inspired by bachata music. The most well known example of this is the made up basic step commonly referred to as the \\"side to side step\\", which is sometimes accompanied by an exaggerated \\"pop‚Äù of the hips during the tap. These novel western dance forms were mostly created copying dance moves from other partner dances of various origins, Latin and non Latin alike. Many such dances exist today, with the first of these often referred to as ‚ÄúWestern side basic step‚Äù. Bachata Often referred to in the West as \\"authentic / Dominican\\" bachata, the original social dance was created in the Dominican Republic during the 1960s and was danced only in closed position, like the bolero, often in close embrace. Bachata basic steps are performed by moving within a small square (side, side, forward and then tap with your toes, then side, side, back and tap). This step was inspired by the bolero basic step, but evolved over time to include a tap and syncopations (steps in between the beats), helping dancers express the more dynamic music being commonly played. The hand placement can vary according to the position of the dances, which can range from very close to open to completely open. Bachata is still danced today in the Caribbean and all over the world, and has been evolving for several decades. It is increasingly danced to faster music, adding more footwork, simple turns and rhythmic free-styling with alternation between close (romantic) and open position. Bachata is danced with soft hip movements and a tap or syncopation (1, 2, 3, tap/syncopation). It can also be danced with or without bouncing (moving the body up on the beats and down again in between the beats by adding slight spring to ones legs).  Variants =Western \\"traditional\\"= At some point in the late 1990s, dancers and dance-schools in the Western world began using a side to side pattern instead of the box-steps. The basic steps of this pattern move side to side, changing direction after every tap. Characteristics of this \\"early\\" dance school dance is the close connection between partners, soft hip movements, tap with a small \\"pop\\" of the hip on the 4th step (1, 2, 3, tap/hip) and does not include many turns/figures. Most of the styling in this dance is from ballroom dance and show moves like dips are commonly used. This was the first novel dance to bachata music that was popularized by dance schools outside the Dominican Republic. =Bachatango= Another dance was developed shortly after the western \\"traditional\\" and was called Bachatango. This is a fusion dance from the West, consisting of short sequences taken from western \\"traditional\\" steps combined with different Tango steps and danced like tango. The \\"pop\\" count is used to add elaborated sensuality and varied Latin ballroom dance styles and also includes the characteristic kicks from tango. The turns are like in the \\"western traditional\\" dance. Although in the past this dance was danced exclusively to bachata music, it has recently been danced to tango music as well. Even though bachatango is unheard of in the Dominican Republic, bachata's country of origin, the dance enjoyed a period of popularity among foreign dance instructors outside the Caribbean. Still, nowadays the dance is not often seen on the social dance floors. =Modern / Moderna= A dance called modern or moderna was developed probably from around 2005 on the \\"western traditional\\" basic elements. The basics are the same as the \\"western traditional\\" dance, but with added dance elements and styling from Salsa, tango and Ballroom. In this dance, couples typically move their torsos more and greatly exaggerate the hip pop (especially the ladies). The most direct influence on the modern/moderna dance comes from the adoption of salsa turn patterns; these, together with dips became the core of the dance. =Sensual= The Sensual dance style was created in C√°diz, Andalusia, Spain, by Korke Escalona and Judith Cordero. Korke learned the basics of western \\"traditional\\" in 1998, but with no more information than the basic step (four steps to the side) and inspired by bachata music, he started developing his own dance style inspired by contemporary and Brazilian zouk dances by understanding how the leader (traditionally a man) could lead the body of the follower (traditionally a lady) to interpret the music. The result is a novel, independent dance form with strict principles of leading and following, with mostly circular movements and body waves, but also body isolations and dips when the dancers feel the music calls for it. Korke is the creator of the BachataStars competition, in which participants get a random song and show ability to improvise, while showing their dance skills and musicality. =Ballroom style= Ballroom style is yet another dance developed in the West, primarily for dance competitions rather than social dancing, with very extreme hip movements and much ballroom dance styling. The basic step is based on western \\"traditional\\" dance. =Other styles= There are other Western dances, pioneered and promoted by different teachers around the world, each with its own distinct flair. Whether these are considered completely different styles or simply variations of the main styles above is often argued by teachers and students alike.

Originally styled after a 1950 Mercury, and later a custom body, the truck has a canine motif, complete with big ears, tail and tongue. It is painted in two tones of brown, with a dog mouth drawn in the front. The truck has three spin offs, two of which are currently competing. It is currently driven by Tanner Root. Truck History Over the years the team has expanded with the addition of the Dalmatian and Rottweiler versions of the truck. It has competed in the World Finals every year since its debut, with Todd Frolik, Bobby Z, Charlie Pauken, all in the brown Mutt, Candice Jolly and Chad Tingler in Mutt Dalmatian, and both trucks will once again compete with Pauken and Jolly driving Monster Mutt and Monster Mutt Dalmatian, respectively. In 2010, Monster Mutt driven by Charlie Pauken went on to win the 2010 Advance Auto Parts NGK Spark Plugs Monster Jam World Finals Freestyle Championship in Las Vegas, Nevada and he got the highest jump of the night. This was Monster Mutt's first ever World Finals Championship. In 2016, the entire fleet of floppy eared fidos all received facelifts due to the update of the classic Mercury body style, now featuring three-dimensional teeth and real studded collars. A fourth truck, Monster Mutt Junkyard Dog, made its debut, but would be retired in April of the same year. In 2019, both drivers Kaylyn Migues, and a new athlete Kristen Hope are driving the Dalmatian in 2 Triple Threat Series. Cynthia Gauthier is going to be driving the ice version of the Monster Mutt Dalmatian for a stadium series with 13 other drivers will compete to get an invite to the Monster Jam World finals XX in Camping World Stadium in Orlando, FL. She won the inaugural High Jump challenge with the height of 45.472 feet. Other versions In the 2007 season, Monster Mutt Dalmatian debuted. The Dalmatians are driven by Candice Jolly and Cynthia Gauthier. Chad Tingler drove it in World Finals 8 and 9. Candice Jolly started competing in the World Finals since 2009. In 2017 Randy Brown drove the Monster Mutt Dalmatian in the International Tour. Candice Jolly took the Dalmatian to this year's International Tour and Cynthia Gauthier took over for her for one event. For 2019 Cynthia Gauthier is going to compete in the Stadium Series 1 representing the Fire and Ice Version of the Monster Mutt Dalmatian. The same year on the Triple Threat Series Kaylyn Migues will be driving the Dalmatian on the Arena Championship Series as Kristen Hope makes her 2019 debut driving another Dalmatian on the Triple Threat Series. In 2011,the Rottweiler version of Monster Mutt joined the Original and Dalmatian Mutt. It was piloted for a few years by Charles Benns (the rottweiler monster truck's original driver) and is now driven by former Team Grave Digger superstar Rod Schmidt. In late 2013, the Rottweiler got an aggressive new 3D body design for the 2014 season, that would serve as the inspiration for the other mutt's modern designs. In 2016, to 2019 the Monster Mutt Rottweiler is piloted by other drivers like Cory Snyder, Jack Brown and a few other drivers throughout the last couple of years. In 2016, The Junkyard Dog version of Monster Mutt was introduced, and was driven by Dustin Brown. Unlike its predecessors, the truck retains the classic Mercury body that Monster Mutt was so famous for, this time with a rusty design. It only competed in that year.

It contains two books of 182 verse epigrams. Its full title is ORUS APOLLO FILS DE OSIRIS ROY DE AEGYPTE NILIACQUE. DES NOTES HIEROGLYPHIQUES. The work is a purported translation of an ancient Greek work on Egyptian hieroglyphs that had been commented on by Marsilio Ficino, Erasmus and Fran√ßois Rabelais. It was known to the artists Albrecht D√ºrer, Andrea Mantegna and Raphael. Although its title implies a connection to Egyptian gods, the French work is actually Nostradamus' extremely free translation of Horapollon of Manuthis' Hieroglyphica, based on Jean Mercier's Latin-Greek version of 1551. He also added some ten pieces of his own. The manuscript, apparently in Nostradamus's own hand, still exists in the Biblioth√®que nationale de France, Paris, as French manuscript No. 2594. The paper has been analyzed, and found to date from 1535‚Äì1539 and to stem from somewhere in the general area of the Comtat Venaissin and Provence. It was dedicated to Jeanne d'Albret, later (from 1555) Queen of Navarre, and is of particular interest to students of Nostradamus' Propheties for its near-total lack of either accents or punctuation (which suggests that their original manuscripts, too, may have lacked both). It is now housed in the Lyon municipal library.

Rugby career Joe Thompson played soccer until his late teens but a short time after trying rugby union he was playing in the Cross Keys RFC first team. While with Cross Keys, Joe Thompson was selected to play for the Welsh national rugby union team in the opening match of the 1923 Five Nations Championship. Wales lost the game 7‚Äì3 and this match was the only cap Joe Thompson won under rugby union rules. In February 1923 he signed for Leeds playing in the . He had worked as a coal miner since the age of 13, a background that had no doubt hardened him. He was a fearless tackler and a powerful runner with terrific ball handling skills, unusual for a forward of that period. More surprising still was his masterly command of goal-kicking, with 862 goals in eleven seasons playing for Leeds. Joe Thompson played right-, i.e. number 12, and scored 5-goals in the 28‚Äì3 victory over Hull F.C. in the 1922‚Äì23 Challenge Cup Final during the 1922‚Äì23 season at Belle Vue, Wakefield, the only occasion the Challenge Cup final has ever been staged at Belle Vue. He was the 1927‚Äì28 season's top point scorer with 233. He was the 1929‚Äì30 season's top point scorer with 243. In all first class games he landed 921 goals and scored over 2,000 points. With 1,883-points, Joe Thompson is third in the Leeds' all time points scoring list, behind Kevin Sinfield (3967-points), and Lewis Jones (3,372-points). In Test matches Joe Thompson was on the winning side on eight occasions in 12 appearances, with the distinction of selection for Australian tours in 1924, 1928 and 1932. In the history of tours to Australasia the only forward to equal this was Brian Edgar of Workington Town. On each of Thompson's three tours Britain came home with The Ashes. The 1932 tour was his apotheosis, playing in a star-studded pack in all six Tests in Australia and New Zealand. This included the infamous second Australian Test, enshrined in Rugby League history as the \\"Battle of Brisbane\\" with nine players suffering serious injury. In New Zealand all three Tests were won and on the whole tour only two of 26 games were lost. Joe Thompson was capped 25 times; 12 internationals for Great Britain (RL), eight for Wales (RL) and five for Other Nationalities (RL). On his retirement in April 1933 Leeds paid him the rare honour of making him a life member of the club. Career records Joe Thompson is one of less than ten Welshmen to have scored more than 2,000 points in their rugby league career.Robert Gate (1988). \\"Gone North ‚Äì Volume 2\\". R. E. Gate.

Captain's Curse was first seen in 2007 driven by Pablo Huffaker at Monster Jam World Finals 8. Alex Blackwell then drove the truck for the next five years until moving to Wolverine in 2012. Styled after a 1941 Willys pickup, the truck originally featured a red-and-black pirate-themed paint scheme. Designed to replace the Blacksmith monster truck, the truck's debut at World Finals 8 was an immediate success, with driver Pablo Huffaker winning his first Monster Jam World Finals freestyle championship behind the wheel of Captain's Curse. Alex Blackwell later took over as driver of the truck with a different chassis, experiencing similar success. At World Finals X, the truck reached the final round in racing against Maximum Destruction. However, the truck lost its brakes during the run, causing the truck to flip violently when Blackwell attempted to steer it. The truck eventually landed several rows in the stands of Sam Boyd Stadium, although no one was injured. After that incident, the truck got a brand new PEI chassis, debuting at Old Bridge Township RACEWAY PARK on May 30, 2009. Ever since then, the truck and driver combo has bought consistent success. In 2012, the truck was temporarily retired, as driver Alex Blackwell was assigned to drive the new version of Wolverine. The truck made a return at the Advance Auto Parts MONSTER JAM World Finals 13 in March 2012, with its original driver Pablo Huffaker behind the wheel. In the 2013 season, Captain's Curse debuted a new black paint scheme, with Blackwell returning behind the wheel. In 2016, a successor named Pirate's Curse debuted, however, the two trucks competed alongside each other for the beginning of the year, with Blackwell eventually moving to Megalodon. Captain‚Äôs Curse has since been retired from competition.

Background Bred and raced by Allen Paulson, she was out of the mare Claxton's Slew, a daughter of 1977 U.S. Triple Crown champion Seattle Slew. Her sire was the great international runner Strawberry Road, who was the 1983 Australian Champion Racehorse of the Year and the 1984 German Champion Older Male Horse. Strawberry Road also sired Allen Paulson's Champion filly and 1997 Breeders' Cup Distaff winner Ajina. Escena was trained by U.S. Racing Hall of Fame inductee William I. Mott. Racing career Escena raced from age two through age five. She won two of her three starts in her debut season at age two, then at age three earned her first Graded stakes race at Oaklawn Park in Hot Springs, Arkansas, in the 1996 Fantasy Stakes. After finishing second in three Grade I races in 1996, the following year she got her first Grade I win in the Ramona Handicap at Del Mar Racetrack in Del Mar, California. She went on to finish third in the 1997 Breeders' Cup Distaff behind winner and stablemate Ajina. At age five, Escena blossomed into a racing star under jockey Jerry Bailey. She won the Grades 1 Vanity Invitational and Apple Blossom Handicaps plus at Churchill Downs, and the Grades II Louisville Breeders' Cup and Fleur de Lis Handicaps. She capped off her 1998 campaign with a win in the Breeders' Cup Distaff and was voted American Champion Older Female Horse honors. Retirement Escena was retired at the end of her 1998 racing campaign and sold to Guy Snowden for $3.25 million at the January 1999 Horses of All Ages Sale at Keeneland. It was the highest price ever paid for a broodmare or broodmare prospect in Keeneland's history.

Piper proposed an effective graphic procedure for presenting water chemistry data to help in understanding the sources of the dissolved constituents in water. This procedure is based on the premise that cations and anions in water are generally in chemical equilibrium. Piper diagram of water samples from the Mtshabezi River, Zimbabwe. Data source: A Piper diagram is a graphical representation of the chemistry of a water sample or samples. The cations and anions are shown by separate ternary plots. The apexes of the cation plot are calcium, magnesium and sodium plus potassium cations. The apexes of the anion plot are sulf ate , chloride and carbonate plus hydrogen carbonate anions. The two ternary plots are then projected onto a diamond. The diamond is a matrix transformation of a graph of the anions (sulfate + chloride/ total anions) and cations (sodium + potassium/total cations). The required matrix transformation of the anion/cation graph is: : begin{bmatrix} x'  y'  1 end{bmatrix} = begin{bmatrix} cos(frac{pi}{2}) & sin(frac{pi}{2}) & 0  -2sin(frac{pi}{2}) & 2cos(frac{pi}{2}) & 0  0 & 0 & 1 end{bmatrix} begin{bmatrix} x  y  1 end{bmatrix} The Piper diagram is suitable for comparing the ionic composition of a set of water samples, but does not lend itself to spatial comparisons.

Colour coding of the background of the Piper diagram allows linking Piper Diagrams and maps Water samples shown on the Piper diagram can be grouped in hydrochemical facies.

Description The church is located in the core of the ancient Greek-Roman city: it takes its name from the Egyptian Nile, which was venerated here by the Egyptian merchants. It was begun in 1385 as a chapel, dedicated to Sts. Angel and Mark, by will of cardinal Rainaldo Brancacci, whose family had a palace nearby. The current appearance dates from a 1709 rebuilding, under the direction of Arcangelo Guglielmelli. Remains of the original Catalan-Gothic structure include the main portal, with an architrave featuring angels, and a fresco in the lunette with The Virgin Mary and Saints Michael and Baculus with Cardinal Brancaccio (15th century). A sculpture of St. Michael from another portal has been moved in the interior. Artworks in the interior include the tomb of cardinal Brancaccio, canvasses from Luca Giordano school, a 16th-century altarpiece by the Sienese painter Marco Pino and a marble tabernacle in the sacristy.

He is best known for his tenure in Chikara, under his real name and the ring name Equinox. Professional wrestling career=Chikara (2006‚Äì2010)= Jimmy Olsen made his Chikara debut on November 12, 2006, alongside Colin Olsen as the Olsen Twins at a tag team tournament to decide new number one contenders to the Chikara Campeonatos de Parejas, but the two lost in the opening round to Cheech and Cloudy. This performance would however earn them a regular spot on the Chikara roster. The Olsens returned in February 2007 during the King of Trios weekend in a match, where they were brutalized at the hands of Yoshiaki Yago and MIYAWAKI. They achieved their first Chikara win during a gauntlet match on night three of that weekend by beating 2.0 (Jagged and Shane Matthews) in 4 seconds. Unfortunately, this would prove to be one of their only wins, with another coming during the Young Lions Cup weekend in June when they upset the North Star Express (Darin Corbin and Ryan Cruz). They would begin occasionally teaming with NWA Upstate colleague Brodie Lee in trios matches, often tackling The Colony, and their adventures in tag team wrestling saw even more enthralling contests with Cheech and Cloudy, including a widely praised match at the \\"Cibernetico and Robin\\" event in September 2007. Colin's signing with World Wrestling Entertainment in early 2008 forced Jimmy into full-time singles wrestling, which he proved to be rather good at, defeating the likes of Icarus and Player Uno, while taking Vin Gerard and Gran Akuma to the limit. However, a first round loss to Stupefied in the Young Lions Cup and Vin Gerard revealing where Colin had really gone caused Jimmy to turn against the fans who had grown to love him as he began to unmask several wrestlers, seemingly hunting for Colin. However, when Colin returned in September, Jimmy declared his hunt for Colin to be over, and thus ending his grudge against any masked wrestlers. This did not end well though as Colin determined that Jimmy had become weak, and as a result Colin turned on his brother and joined Vin Gerard and STIGMA to form the UnStable. Now firmly back in the tecnico camp, Jimmy looked to gain adequate revenge on the rudos, who tricked him and betrayed him. He formed a successful tag team with former foe Lince Dorado, and in late 2008 began donning the old Equinox attire, worn originally by Vin Gerard, in an effective attempt to get into his head. Helios in April 2010 The year began with the formal announcement of Olsen, Dorado and Helios as a full-time unit in Chikara, dubbed The Future Is Now. Things got even better for Olsen when on January 25, 2009, he finally defeated Vin Gerard, this time in a ladder match, to become the new Chikara Young Lions Cup Champion. He opted to remain wrestling as Equinox in Chikara, due to the success the mask had brought him. On March 14, 2009 in Binghamton, New York Jimmy Olsen defeated Slyck Wagner Brown and \\"Main Event\\" Jason Axe inside a steel cage to become the 2CW Heavyweight Champion. Olsen suffered a broken foot in May 2009 that kept him out of the ring. He lost the 2CW Title to Jason Axe on June 5. Olsen held the Young Lions Cup until August 2009, when he had to vacate it for the seventh annual Young Lions Cup tournament. On January 31, 2010, Equinox and Dorado joined forces with Mike Quackenbush and Jigsaw in an eight man tag team match against Bruderschaft des Kreuzes (Claudio Castagnoli, Ares, Tursas and a mystery partner). However, during the match Dorado turned on Equinox and revealed himself as the mystery member of BDK, who wound up winning the match, when Castagnoli pinned Dorado's replacement in Quackenbush's team, Eddie Kingston. On March 20 at Wit, Verve, and a Bit o' Nerve Olsen was defeated by Dorado in a singles match. In May 2010, during the Aniversario weekend, Equinox and Helios first defeated Dorado and his BDK teammate Tim Donst in a tag team match and then won a four-team elimination match to earn the three points needed in order to challenge for the Campeonatos de Parejas. Equinox and Helios received their title shot on June 27 at Faded Scars and Lines, but were defeated by the defending champions BDK (Ares and Claudio Castagnoli) in two straight falls after a pre‚Äìmatch assault. Jimmy (left) and Colin Olsen in 2011 On September 19, 2010, at Through Savage Progress Cuts the Jungle Line Equinox, Helios and Jigsaw faced the UnStable in a six-man tag team match. During the match Colin Delaney turned on Vin Gerard and STIGMA, after which Gerard got his team disqualified by low blowing the former Olsen Twins. After the match Olsen and Delaney re‚Äìformed their tag team, with Olsen dropping the Equinox gimmick during a post‚Äìmatch hug with Delaney. On October 24, in the first match between the Olsen Twins and the UnStable, Vin Gerard picked up the victory for his team by forcing Delaney Olsen to submit. The two teams had a rematch on November 21, this time with the Olsen Twins coming out victorious. =Retirement (2011-2012)= After losing to Colin on December 23, 2011 in a singles match for Absolute Intense Wrestling, Olsen retired from professional wrestling. However, he returned to the ring on April 13, 2012 and reformed the Olsen Twins with Colin in a losing effort to The Briscoe Brothers in a match for Squared Circle Wrestling.

History  Beatties was founded by Colonel S N Beattie and Charles Whale as the Southgate Model Shop. In the early 1960s they had two small shops on Winchmore Hill Road in London. Looking away from the tube station the one on the right sold new model railway equipment and the one on the left was full of used stuff. He later bought out the Bassett Lowke shops after Whale left the company. On Beatties' retirement the business was bought by Richard Kohnstamm Ltd (best known as Riko and also the Tamiya importers) who then expanded it into a major chain. At some point the focus on model railways was dropped and Beatties became more like a general toy store. The retail company Era Group plc owned Beatties by the end of its days as a retailer. By the late 1990s Beatties had 60 stores, in locations including the MetroCentre, Gateshead, and the Merry Hill Shopping Centre in the West Midlands. The company had an e-commerce website. The chain ran into financial trouble after an attempt to break into the already well-served video games market, where they struggled against well-established competitors. On 14 March 2001 the company was placed into administration by its parent company ERA Group. Alan Bloom and Chris Hill, partners at Ernst & Young, were appointed as joint administrative receivers by Barclays Bank, at the request of Era. The shares of Era Group, which Beatties made up the largest part of, were suspended from the AIM list on 27 February 2001. In October 1999 some stores began to close. In July 2000 34 of the 60 stores were closed, and Era Group attempted to raise ¬£5m through a share issue to help pay creditors. In March 2001, 13 of the remaining stores were sold to turnaround specialists Hilco, and the final 13 stores were closed, at the cost of more than 100 jobs. Modelzone acquired many of the former Beatties stores and also suffered a similar fate closing down in 2013. A museum-quality collection of heritage transport toys called \\"The Beatties Collection\\" was auctioned by Phillips with a reserve price of around ¬£50,000.

Moscona was also employed by the Strangeways Research Laboratory in Cambridge, England and at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Massachusetts. Scientific work In experiments performed through the 1960s, Moscona was able to separate embryonic cells using enzymes and then found that they were able to reform in their original structures once they were allowed to grow back together. His early work resulted in the identification by Masatoshi Takeichi of a class of proteins called cadherins which play a role in cell adhesion by allowing molecules to recognize each other. As he noted in a 1961 article in Scientific American, without the ability of these proteins to allow cells to form bonds with similar cells, \\"the human body would collapse into a heap of disconnected, individual cells, many of them quite indistinguishable from certain free-living protozoa.\\" The article included photographs showing how mixtures of cells in flasks differentiated themselves by combining with like cells and how that ability faded over a period of weeks, with newer cells better able to recombine into structures closely resembling their embryonic arrangement than were older ones. He found that \\"Cells dissociated from adult animals usually do not recohere at all\\". Applications By 1981, techniques Moscona developed were used to grow brain cells in solution, with cells in the growth medium forming connections with other neurons.Staff. \\"New Techniques\\", Evening Independent, April 15, 1981. Accessed January 26, 2009. Other experiments found that like cells from across species shared common features of their cellular recognition signaling mechanism, in which a mixture of embryonic kidney cells from mice and chickens would form structures combining cells from both species. He also developed growth mediums, including solutions made from clotted blood diluted in saline, that were used by other researchers in their work. He found that changes in the swirling speed and temperature of the solutions would affect the growth of the cells in the medium. Death Moscona died at age 87 on January 14, 2009 in Manhattan of heart failure. He was survived by his wife, daughter and two grandchildren.

The six murders among these included that of police officer Mich√®le Kiesewetter, in Heilbronn, Germany on 25 April 2007. The only connection between the crimes was DNA, which as of March 2009 had been recovered from 40 crime scenes, ranging from murders to burglaries. In late March 2009, investigators concluded that the \\"Phantom\\" criminal did not exist, and the DNA recovered at the crime scenes had already been present on the cotton swabs used for collecting DNA samples; they belonged to a woman who worked at the factory where they were made.'DNA bungle' haunts German police (28 March 2009) BBC.

They subsequently came to the conclusion that the mysterious criminal did not exist and that the laboratory results were due to contamination of the cotton buds used for DNA probing. Although sterile, the swabs are not certified for human DNA collection. The cotton swabs used by many state police departments were found to have been contaminated before shipping. It was found that the contaminated swabs all came from the same factory, which employs several Eastern European women who fit the type the DNA was assumed to match.

Although the description of this battle has had an important place in Islamic historiography, much of the material has little historical value.D. Gershon Lewental, \\"QƒÄDESIYA, BATTLE OF,\\" Encyclop√¶dia Iranica Online, available at http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/qadesiya- battle (accessed on 21 July 2014). The battle took place at an uncertain date at the small frontier town of Qadisiyyah. The larger Sasanian army was headed by the important military and political figure Rostam Farrokhzad, who died in uncertain circumstances during battle, and a collapse of the Sasanian army led to an Arab Muslim victory.D. Gershon Lewental, \\"QƒÄDESIYA, BATTLE OF,\\" Encyclop√¶dia Iranica Online, available at http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/qadesiya-battle (accessed on 21 July 2014). The Muslim victory was key to the conquest of Asorestan (Iraq), and was followed by major engagements at Jalula and Nahavand. The battle also saw the alleged alliance of Emperor Yazdegerd III with Byzantine emperor Heraclius, who married his granddaughter Manyanh to Yazdegerd as a symbol of alliance.  Background  During Muhammad's lifetime, the Sasanian Empire was ruled by Khosrow II. The Byzantine‚ÄìSasanian War of 602‚Äì628 was justified by Khosrow as an attempt to avenge the murder of his ally, Byzantine emperor Maurice, by a pretender, Emperor Phocas. The military of the Sasanian Empire invaded and captured Syria, Egypt, and Anatolia, and the True Cross was carried away in triumph.Ashtiani, Abbas Iqbal and Pirnia, Hassan. Tarikh-e Iran (History of Iran), 3rd ed. Tehran: Kayyam Publishing House, 1973. Emperor Heraclius succeeded Phocas in 610 and led the Byzantines in a war of reconquest, successfully regaining territory lost to the Sasanians. He defeated a small Persian army at the final Battle of Nineveh and advanced towards Ctesiphon. After a successful coup by one of Khosrow's sons, Kavadh II, the new ruler ordered the execution of his father along with all his brothers and half- brothers, which included Mardanshah, the favorite son of Khosrow II, who was heir to the Sasanian throne. Kavadh's next move was to make peace with the Byzantines and return all captured territories. At the same time the G√∂kt√ºrks had attacked the north of Persia with a massive army. Heraclius ordered his armies to retreat after a pact was signed with Kavadh. According to the pact, the True Cross would be given back to Heraclius, and all Byzantine territory that the Persians had captured would be evacuated. = Internal conflicts of succession = As mentioned before, Khosrow II was murdered in his palace by his son Kavadh II in 628, who also put his 18 brothers to death and began negotiations with Heraclius. However, the new ruler died suddenly after a reign of only a few months after being infected by plague. Thus began a civil war. Ardashir III (c. 621‚Äì630), son of Kavadh II, was raised to the throne at age seven but was killed 18 months later by his general Farrokhan, who was called Shahrbaraz, a title meaning \\"the Boar of the Empire\\". Shahrbaraz declared himself ruler. Shahrbaraz had taken Damascus and Jerusalem from the Byzantine Empire in 613 and 614 respectively. On 9 June 629, Shahrbaraz was killed during an invasion from Armenia by a Khazar‚ÄìG√∂kt√ºrk force under Chorpan Tarkhan. He was succeeded by Boran, daughter of Khosrow II. She was the 26th sovereign monarch of Persia, ruling from 17 June 629 to 16 June 630, and was one of only two women to sit on the Sasanian throne, the other being her sister Azarmidokht. She was made empress regnant on the understanding that she would vacate the throne upon Yazdegerd III attaining majority. Boran attempted to bring stability to the empire by the implementation of justice, reconstruction of the infrastructure, lowering taxes, minting coins, and a peace treaty with the Byzantine Empire. She also appointed Rostam FarrokhzƒÅd as the commander-in-chief of the Persian army. Boran was largely unsuccessful in restoring the power of the central authority, however, which was weakened considerably by civil wars, and she resigned or was murdered soon after. She was replaced by her sister Azarmidokht, who in turn was replaced by Hormizd VI, a noble of the Persian court. After five years of internal power struggle, Yazdegerd III, grandson of Khosrow II, became emperor at the age of eight. The real pillars of the Persian state were generals Rostam FarrokhzƒÅd and Piruz Khosrow (also known as Piruzan). There was friction between the two, although pressure from courtiers pushed this backstage. The coronation of Yazdegerd III infused new life into the Sasanian Empire.  Rise of the Caliphate and invasion of Iraq  After the death of Muhammad, Abu Bakr established control over Arabia through the Ridda Wars and then launched campaigns against the remaining Arabs of Syria and Palestine. He triggered the chain of events which would in few decades form one of the largest empires the world had ever seen.Akram, A. I. The Sword of Allah: Khalid bin al-Waleed, His Life and Campaigns, Nat. Publishing House. Rawalpindi, 1970. . He thus put the nascent Islamic empire on a collision course with the Byzantine and Sassanid empires, which were the two super-powers of the time. The wars soon became a matter of conquest that would eventually result in the demise of the Sassanid empire and the annexation of all of the Byzantine Empire's southern and eastern territory.The Battle of Al-Qadisiyyah and the Conquest of Syria and Palestine A.D. 635‚Äì637/A.H. 14‚Äì15 By Tabari To make victory certain, Abu Bakr decided that the invading army would consist entirely of volunteers and would be commanded by his best general, Khalid ibn al-Walid. Khalid won quick victories in four consecutive battles: the Battle of Chains, fought in April 633; the Battle of River, fought in the third week of April 633; the Battle of Walaja, fought in May 633; followed by the decisive Battle of Ullais, fought in mid- May, 633. By now the Persian Empire was struggling, and in the last week of May 633, the capital city of Iraq, Al-Hirah, fell to the Muslims after the Battle of Hira. Thereafter, the Siege of Al-Anbar during June‚ÄìJuly 633 resulted in surrender of the city after strong resistance. Khalid then moved towards the south and conquered the city of Ein ul Tamr after the Battle of Ayn al-Tamr in the last week of July 633. In November 633, the Persian counter-attack was repulsed by Khalid. In December 633, Muslim forces reached the border city of Firaz, where Khalid defeated the combined Sassanid, Byzantine, and Christian Arab armies in the Battle of Firaz. This was the last battle in the conquest of Iraq. Map detailing the route of Khalid ibn Walid's conquest of Iraq By this time, with the exception of Ctesiphon, Khalid had captured all of Iraq. However, circumstances changed on the western front. The Byzantine army soon came in direct conflict in Syria and Palestine, and Khalid was sent with half of his army to deal with this new development. Soon after, Caliph Abu Bakr died in August 634 and was succeeded by Caliph Umar ibn al- KhattƒÅb. Muslim forces in Iraq were too few in number to control the region. After the devastating invasion by Khalid, the Persians took time to recover; political instability was at its peak at Ctesiphon. Once the Persians recovered, they concentrated more troops and mounted a counterattack. Al- Muthanna ibn Haritha, who was now commander-in-chief of the Muslim forces in Iraq, pulled his troops back from all outposts and evacuated Al-Hirah. He then retreated to the region near the Arabian Desert. Meanwhile, Umar sent reinforcements from Madinah under the command of Abu Ubaid. The reinforcements reached Iraq in October 634, and Abu Ubaid assumed the command of the army and defeated the Sassanids at the Battle of Namaraq near modern-day Kufa. Then, in the Battle of Kaskar, he recaptured Hira. The Persians launched another counterattack and defeated the Muslims at Battle of the Bridge, which killed Abu Ubaid, and the Muslims suffered heavy losses. Muthanna then assumed command of the army and withdrew the remnant of his forces, about 3000 strong, across the Euphrates. The Persian commander Bahman (also known as Dhu al- Hajib) was committed to driving the Muslims away from Persian soil but was restrained from pursuing the defeated Muslims after being called back by Rustum to Ctesiphon to help in putting down the revolt against him. Muthanna retreated near the frontier of Arabia and called for reinforcements. After getting sufficient reinforcements, he re-entered the fray and camped at the western bank of Euphrates, where a Persian force intercepted him and was defeated. Persian counter-attack After Khalid left Iraq for Syria, Suwad, the fertile area between the Euphrates and the Tigris, remained unstable. Sometimes it was occupied by the Persians and sometimes by the Muslims. This \\"tit-for-tat\\" struggle continued until emperor Yazdegerd III consolidated his power and sought alliance with Heraclius in 635 in an effort to prepare for a massive counterattack. Heraclius married his daughter to Yazdegerd III, in accordance with Roman tradition to seal an alliance. Heraclius then prepared for a major offensive in the Levant. Meanwhile, Yazdegerd ordered a concentration of massive armies to reclaim Iraq for good. This was supposed to be a well-coordinated attack by both emperors to annihilate the power of their common enemy, Caliph Umar. When Heraclius launched his offensive in May 636, Yazdegerd could not coordinate on time, so the plan was not carried out as planned. Meanwhile, Umar allegedly had knowledge of this alliance and devised his own plan to counteract it. He wanted to finish the Byzantines first, and later deal with the Persians separately. Accordingly, he sent 6000 soldiers as reinforcements to his army in Yarmouk who were facing off the Byzantine army. Simultaneously, Umar engaged Yazdegerd III, ordering Saad ibn Abi Waqqas to enter in peace negotiations with him by inviting him to convert to Islam.This was not a tactic of deception but an implementation of the command of Muhammad, who used to order his troops to call the enemy to Islam before engaging them in battle. The Muslim Conquest of Persia By A.I. Akram. p. 133 , Heraclius, fearing the abovementioned scenario had instructed his general Vahan not to engage in battle with Muslims and await his orders. However, Vahan, witnessing fresh reinforcements for the Muslims arriving daily from Madinah, felt compelled to attack the Muslim forces before they got too strong. Heraclius's imperial army was annihilated at Battle of Yarmouk in August 636, three months before the battle of Qadisiyyah, therefore ending the Roman Emperor's offensive in the west. Undeterred, Yazdegerd continued to execute his plan of attack and concentrated armies near his capital Ctesiphon. A large force was put under the control of veteran general Rostam and was cantoned at Valashabad near Ctesiphon. Receiving news of preparations for a massive counter-attack, Umar ordered Muthana to abandon Iraq and retreat to the edge of the Arabian Desert. The Iraqi campaign would be addressed at a later date.  Muslim battle preparation  Caliph Umar started raising new armies from all over Arabia with the intention of re-invading Iraq. Umar appointed Sa\`d ibn Abƒ´ WaqqƒÅs, an important member of the Quraysh tribe as commander of this army. In May 636, Sa'd was instructed to march to Northern Arabia with a contingent of 4,000 men from his camp at Sisra (near Madinah) and take over command of the Muslim army, and immediately march onwards to Iraq. Because of his inexperience as a general, he was instructed by Caliph Umar to seek the advice of experienced commanders before making critical decisions. Umar sent orders to him to halt at al-Qadisiyyah, a small town 30 miles from Kufah. Umar continued to remotely issue strategic orders and commands to his army throughout the campaign. Due to a shortage of manpower, Umar decided to lift the ban on the ex-apostate tribes of Arabia from participating in state affairs. The army raised was not professional but was a volunteer force composed of newly recruited contingents from all over Arabia. After a decisive victory against the Byzantine army at the Yarmouk, Umar sent immediate orders to Abu Ubaidah to send a contingent of veterans to Iraq. A force of 5,000 veterans of Yarmouk were also sent to Qadisiyyah, they arrived on the second day of the battle Qadisiyyah. This proved to be a major turning point, and a major morale booster for the Muslim army. The battle of Qadissiyyah was fought predominantly between Umar and Rostam, rather than between Saad and Rostam. Coincidentally, bulk of the Sassanid army was also made up of new recruits since the bulk of regular Sassanid forces was destroyed during the Battle of Walaja and the Ullais.  Battlefield  The site of the Battle of Qadisiyyah, showing Muslim army (in red) and Sassanid army (in blue) Qadisiyya was a small town on the west bank of the river Ateeq, a branch of the Euphrates. Al-Hira, ancient capital of Lakhmid Dynasty, was about thirty miles west. According to present day geography, it is situated at southwest of al-Hillah and Kufah in Iraq.  Troop deployment  Modern estimates suggest that the size of the Sassanid forces was about 50,000‚Äì100,000 strong and that of the Muslims was around 30,000 strong after being reinforced by the Syrian contingent on second day of the battle. These figures come from studying the logistical capabilities of the combatants, the sustainability of their respective bases of operations, and the overall manpower constraints affecting the Sassanids and Arabs. Most scholars, however, agree that the Sassanid army and their allies outnumbered the Muslim Arabs by a sizable margin. = Sassanid Persia = The Persian army reached Qadisiyyah in July 636 and established their highly fortified camps on the eastern bank of the Ateeq river. There was a strong bridge over the Ateeq river, the only crossing to the main Sassanid camps, although they had boats available in reserve to cross the river. The Sassanid Persian army, about 60,000 strong, fell into three main categories, infantry, heavy cavalry, and the Elephant corps. The Elephant corps was also known as the Indian corps, for the elephants were trained and brought from Persian provinces in India. On 16 November 636, the Sassanid army crossed over the west bank of Ateeq, and Rostam deployed his 45,000 infantry in four divisions, each about 150 meters apart from the other. 15,000 cavalry were divided among four divisions to be used as reserve for counter-attack and offensives. At Qadisiyyah, about 33 elephants were present, eight with each of the four divisions of army. The battle front was about 4 km long. The Sassanid Persians' right wing was commanded by Hormuzan, the right center by Jalinus, the rear guard by Piruzan, and the left wing by Mihran. Rostam himself was stationed at an elevated seat, shaded by a canopy, near the west bank of the river and behind the right center, where he enjoyed a wide view of the battlefield. By his side waved the Derafsh-e-KƒÅveyƒÅn (in Persian: ÿØÿ±ŸÅÿ¥ ⁄©ÿßŸà€åÿßŸÜ, the 'flag of KƒÅveh'), the standard of the Sassanid Persians. Rostam placed men at certain intervals between the battlefield and the Sassanid capital, Ctesiphon, to transmit information. = Rashidun = In July 636, the main Muslim army marched from Sharaf to Qadisiyya. After establishing camp, organizing defenses, and securing river heads, Sa'd sent parties inside Suwad to conduct raids. Sa'd was continuously in contact with Caliph Umar, to whom he sent a detailed report of the geographical features of the land where the Muslims encamped and the land between Qaddasiyyah, Madinah, and the region where the Persians were concentrating their forces. The Muslim army at this point was about 30,000 strong, including 7,000 cavalry. Its strength rose to 36,000 once it was reinforced by the contingent from Syria and by local Arab allies. Sa'd was suffering from sciatica, and had boils all over his body. He took a seat in the old royal palace at Qaddasiyyah from where he directed the war operations and had a good view of the battlefield. He appointed as his deputy Khalid ibn Urfuta, who carried out his instructions to the battlefield through the chains of messengers. The Rashidun infantry was deployed in four corps, each with its own cavalry regiment stationed at the rear for counter-attacks. Each corps was positioned about 150 meters from the other. The army was formed on a tribal and clan basis, so that every man fought next to well-known comrades and so that tribes were held accountable for any weakness.  Weaponry  The Muslim forces wore gilded helmets similar to the silver helmets of the Sassanid soldiers. Mail was commonly used to protect the face, neck, and cheeks, either as an aventail from the helmet or as a mail coif. Heavy leather sandals as well as Roman type sandal boots were also typical of the early Muslim soldiers. Armor included hardened leather scale or lamellar armour and mail. Infantry were more heavily armored than cavalry. Hauberks and large wooden or wickerwork shields were used as well as long-shafted spears. Infantry spears were about 2.5 meters long and those of the cavalry were up to 5.5 meters long. Swords used were a short infantry weapon like the Roman gladius and the Sassanid long sword. Both were worn hung from a baldric. Bows were about two meters long when unbraced, about the same size as the famous English longbow, with a maximum range of about 150 meters. Early Muslim archers were infantry archers who proved very effective against the opposing cavalry. The Rashidun troops at the Sassanid Persian front were lightly armored compared to those deployed at the Byzantine front.  The battle  The Arabs had been camped at al-Qadisiyyah with 30,000 men since July 636. Umar ordered Sa'd to send emissaries to Yazdegerd III and the general of the Sasanian army, Rostam Farrokhzad, inviting them to convert to Islam. For the next three months, negotiations between the Arabs and Persians continued. On Caliph Umar's instructions, Saad sent an embassy to court of Persia with instructions to convert the Sassanid emperor to Islam or to get him to agree to paying the jizyah. An-Numan ibn Muqarrin led the Muslim emissary to Ctesiphon and met Sasanian Emperor Yazdgerd III, but the mission failed. Tactical deployment During one meeting, Yazdgerd III, intent on humiliating the Arabs, ordered his servants to place a basket full of earth on the head of Asim ibn 'Amr al-Tamimi, a member of the emissary. The optimistic Arab ambassador interpreted this gesture with the following words: \\"Congratulations! The enemy has voluntarily surrendered its territory to us,\\" (referring to the earth in the basket). Rustam, the Persian general, held a view similar to Asim ibn 'Amr. He allegedly rebuked Yazdgerd III for the basket of earth because it signified that the Persian voluntarily surrendered their land to the Muslims. Yazdgerd III, upon hearing this, ordered soldiers to pursue the Muslim emissaries; and retrieve the basket, however the emissaries were already at their base camp at that point. As tensions eased on the Syrian front, Caliph Umar instructed negotiations to be halted. This was an open signal to the Persians to prepare for battle. Rostam FarrokhzƒÅd, who was at Valashabad, broke camp for Qadisiyyah. He was inclined, however, to avoid fighting and once more opened peace negotiations. Sa'd sent Rabi bin Amir and later Mughirah bin Zurarah to hold talks. Rostam tried to incite Arabs to choose a peaceful outcome: \\"You are neighbours. Some of you were in our land and we were considerate of them and protected them from harm. We helped them in all manners. They brought their herd to graze in our pastures. We gave them foodstuff from our land. We let them trade in our land. Their livelihood was in good order [...] When there was a drought in your land and you asked us for help, we sent you dates and barley. I know that you are here because you are poor. I will order that your commander receives clothing and horse with 1,000 dirham and that each of you receive a load of dates and two sets of clothing so that you leave our land, because I don‚Äôt want to take you prisoner or kill you.\\" But the emissaries insisted that Persians had to choose between becoming Muslim, paying Jizyah or making war. After the negotiations fell through, both sides prepared for battle. = Day 1 = Persian left wing pushed back Muslim's right wing On 16 November 636, an intervening canal was choked up and converted into a road on Rostam's orders and before dawn the entire Persian army crossed the canal. Rostam now armed himself with a double set of complete armour and requisite weapons. Both armies stood face to face about 500 meters apart. The Rashidun army was deployed facing northeast, while the Sassanid army was deployed facing southwest and had the river at its rear. Just before the battle started, Sa'd sought to encourage the soldiers: ‚ÄúThis is your heritage, promised to you by your God. He made it available to you 3 years ago and you have been profiting from it until now, capturing, ransoming and killing its people.‚Äù Asim ibn 'Amr told the riders: ‚ÄúYou are superior to them and God is with you. If you are persistent and strike in the proper way, their riches, women and children will be yours.‚Äù A cavalry and infantry regiments from Muslim's right center reinforce Muslim's right wing and fight off Persian's left wing The battle began with personal duels; Muslim Mubarizun stepped forward and many were slain on both sides. Muslim chronicles record several heroic duels between the Sassanid and Muslim champions. The purpose of these duels was to lower the morale of the opposing army by killing as many champions as possible. Having lost several in duels, Rostam began the battle by ordering his left wing to attack the Muslims' right wing. Persians right wing and right center attacks and drove back Muslim's respective corps The Persian attack began with heavy showers of arrows, which caused considerable damage to the Muslims' right wing. Elephants led the charge from the Persian side. Abdullah ibn Al-Mutim, the Muslim commander of right wing ordered Jareer ibn Abdullah (cavalry commander of the right wing) to deal with the Sassanid elephants. However, Jareer's cavalry was stopped by the Sassanid heavy cavalry. The elephants continued to advance, and the Muslim infantry began to fall back. Muslims succeed in routing the Sassanid elephants, following with a two-prong attack on the Persian right wing and right center, with cavalry attacks on the flank and infantry from the rear Saad sent orders to Al-Ash'ath ibn Qays, commander of the center right cavalry to check the Sassanid cavalry advance. Al-Ash'ath then led a cavalry regiment that reinforced the right wing cavalry and launched a counterattack at the flank of the Sassanid left wing. Meanwhile, Sa'd sent orders to Zuhra ibn Al-Hawiyya, commander of the Muslim right center, to dispatch an infantry regiment to reinforce the infantry of the right wing. An infantry regiment was sent under Hammal ibn Malik that helped the right wing infantry launch a counterattack against the Sassanids. The Sassanid left wing retreated under the frontal attack by infantry of the Muslims' right wing reinforced by infantry regiments from the right center and a flanking attack by the Muslim cavalry reinforced by a cavalry regiment from the right center. Muslims general attack on the Persian front With his initial attacks repulsed, Rostam ordered his right center and right wing to advance against the Muslim cavalry. The Muslim left wing and left center were first subjected to intense archery, followed by a charge of the Sassanid right wing and right center. Once again, the Elephant corps led the charge. The Muslim cavalry on the left wing and left center, already in panic due to the charge of the elephants, were driven back by the combined charge of the Sassanid heavy cavalry and the elephants. Sa'd sent word to Asim ibn 'Amr, commander of the left center, to overpower the elephants. Asim's strategy was to overcome the archers on the elephants' and cut the girths of the saddles. Asim ordered his archers to kill the men on elephants and ordered infantry to cut the girths of the saddles. The tactic worked, and as the Persians retired the elephants, the Muslims counterattacked. The Sassanid army's center right retreated followed by the retreat of the entire right wing. By afternoon the Persian attacks on the Muslim left wing and left center were also beaten back. Saad, in order to exploit this opportunity, ordered a yet another counterattack. The Muslim cavalry then charged from the flanks with full force, a tactic known as Karr wa farr. The Muslim attacks were eventually repulsed by Rostam, who plunged into the fray personally and is said to have received several wounds. The fighting ended at dusk. The battle was inconclusive, with considerable losses on both sides. In the Muslim chronicles, the first day of the battle of Qadisiyyah is known as Yawm al- Armath (ŸäŸàŸÖ ÿ£ÿ±ŸÖÿßÿ´) or \\"The Day of Disorder\\". = Day 2 = On 17 November, like the previous day, Sa'd decided to start the day with the Mubarizuns to inflict maximum morale damage on the Persians. At noon, while these duels were still going on, reinforcements from Syria arrived for the Muslim army. First, an advance guard under Al-Qaqa ibn Amr al-Tamimi arrived, followed by the main army under its commander Hashim ibn Utbah, nephew of Sa'd.The History of Al- Tabari: The Challenge to the Empires, Translated by Khalid Yahya Blankinship, Published by SUNY Press, 1993, , Qa‚Äôqa divided his advance guard into several small groups and instructed them to reach the battlefield one after the other, giving the impression that a very large contingent of reinforcements had arrived. This strategy had a very demoralizing effect the Persian army. Rustam ordered a general attack on the Muslim front On this day, Qa‚Äôqa is said to have killed the Persian general Bahman, who had earlier commanded the Sassanid army at the Battle of Bridge. As there were no elephants in the Sassanid fighting force that day, Sa'd sought to exploit this opportunity to gain any breakthrough if possible, so he ordered a general attack. All four Muslim corps surged forward, but the Sassanids stood firm and repulsed repeated attacks. During these charges, Qa‚Äôqa resorted to the ingenious device of camouflaging camels to look like strange monsters. These monsters moved to the Sassanid front; seeing them, the Sassanid horses turned and bolted. The disorganization of the Sassanid cavalry left their left center infantry vulnerable. Sa'd ordered the Muslims to intensify the attack. Qa‚Äôqa ibn Amr, now acting as the field commander of the Muslim army, planned to kill Rostam, and led a group of Mubarizuns, from his Syrian contingent who were also veterans of the Battle of Yarmouk, through the Sassanids' right center towards Rostam's headquarters. Rostam once again personally led a counterattack against the Muslims, but no breakthrough could be achieved. At dusk, the two armies pulled back to their camps. = Day 3 = Persians attack Muslims using elephant corps On 18 November, Rostam wanted a quick victory, before more Muslim reinforcements could arrive. The Elephant corps was once again in the front of the Sassanid army, giving him the advantage. Pressing this advantage, Rostam ordered a general attack along the Muslim front, using his entire force. All four Sassanid corps moved forward and struck the Muslims on their front. The Persian attack began with the customary volley of arrows and projectiles. The Muslims sustained heavy losses before their archers retaliated. The Persian elephant corps once again led the charge, supported by their infantry and cavalry. At the approach of the Sassanid elephants, the Muslim riders once again became unnerved, leading to confusion in the Muslim ranks. The Sassanids pressed the attack, and the Muslims fell back. Through the gaps that had appeared in the foe's ranks as a result of the Sassanid advance, Rostam sent a cavalry regiment to capture the old palace where Sa'ad was stationed. Rostam's strategy was that the Muslim Commander-in-Chief had to be killed or taken captive to demoralize the Muslims. However, a strong cavalry contingent of the Muslims rushed to the spot and drove away the Sassanid cavalry. Persian attack beaten back, with elephants driven off the field for good Sa'd determined that there was only one way to win the battle: to destroy the Sassanid elephant corps that was causing great havoc among the Muslim ranks. He issued orders that the elephants should be overpowered by blinding them and severing their trunks. After a long struggle, the Muslims finally succeeded in mutilating the elephants sufficiently to be driven off. The frightened elephant corps rushed through the Sassanid ranks and made for the river. By noon no elephants were left on the battlefield. The flight of the elephants caused considerable confusion in the Sassanid ranks. To exploit this situation even further, Sa'd ordered a general attack, and the two armies clashed once again. In spite of the Muslims' repeated charges, the Sassanids held their ground. In the absence of the Persian elephants, the Muslims once again brought up camels camouflaged as monsters. The trick did not work this time, and the Persian horses stood their ground.The countries and tribes of the Persian Gulf, By Samuel Barrett Miles, Published by Garnet & Ithaca Press, 1994, , 9781873938560 The third day of the battle was the hardest for both armies. There were heavy casualties on both sides, and the battlefield was strewn with the dead bodies of fallen warriors. In spite of fatigue after three days of battle, the armies continued the fight, which raged through the night and ending only with the dawn. It became a battle of stamina, with both sides on the verge of breaking. Sa'd's strategy was to wear down the Persians and snatch victory from them. In the Muslim chronicles, the third day of the Battle is known as Yaum-ul-Amas and the night as Lailat-ul-Harir, meaning the \\"Night of Rumbling Noises\\". = Day 4 = Muslims attack the Persian front, Qa'qa's men penetrated the right center of the Persian army and killed Rustam At sunrise of 19 November 636, the fighting had ceased, but the battle was still inconclusive. Qa'qa, with the consent of Sa'd, was now acting as the field commander of the Muslim troops. He is reported to have addressed his men as follows: The Muslims' left center led by Qa‚Äôqa surged forward and attacked the Sassanid right center, followed by the general attack of the Muslim corps. The Sassanids were taken by surprise at the resumption of battle. The Sassanids left wing and left center were pushed back. Qa‚Äôqa again led a group of Mubarizuns against the Sassanids' left center and by noon, he and his men were able to pierce through the Sassanid center. However, they were unable to break the Persian army. Muslim attacks were beaten back by the Persians right wing and right center = Final battle = On the final day, Rostam was slain, which heralded the defeat of the Persians. Multiple different accounts have been told of his mysterious death: 1) Qa'qa and his men dashed towards the Sassanid Headquarter. Meanwhile, in the middle of a sandstorm, Rostam was found dead with over 600 wounds on his body. The Persians were not aware of his death, though, and they continued to fight. The Sassanid right wing counter-attacked and gained its lost position, as the Muslims' left wing retreated back to their original position. The Muslims' left center, now under Qa‚Äôqa's command, when denied the support of their left wing, also retreated back to its original position. Sa'd now ordered a general attack on the Sassanid front to drive away the Persians, demoralized by the death of their charismatic leader. In the afternoon the Muslims mounted another attack. 2) There was a heavy sandstorm facing the Persian army on the final day of the battle. Rostam lay next to a camel to shelter himself from the storm, while some weapons, such as axes, maces, and swords had been loaded on the camel. HilƒÅl ibn \`Ullafah accidentally cut the girdle of the load on the camel, not knowing that Rostam was behind and under it. The weapons fell on Rostam and broke his back leaving him half dead and paralyzed. Hilal beheaded Rostam and shouted \\"I swear to the god of Kaaba that I have killed Rostam.\\" Shocked by the head of their legendary leader dangling before their eyes, the Persians were demoralized, and the commanders lost control of the army. Many Persian soldiers were slain in the chaos, many escaped through the river, and finally the rest of the army surrendered. This account has been dismissed as unlikely due to a number of problems with the story including the presence of suspicious literary devices and general inconsistencies in the narrative. 3) A version from Ya'qubi records that Dhiraar bin Al-Azwar, Tulayha, Amru bin Ma'adi Yakrib and Kurt bin Jammah al-Abdi discovered the corpse of Rostam.The Origins of the Islamic State quoting Yalubi volume II p. 165 4.) Yet another version states that Rostam was killed during single combat with Sa'd during which the former was slain while temporarily blinded by the sandstorm. However, like the Al-Tabari, is likely an invention of later story-tellers. Persians retreating across the river The Sassanid front, after putting up a last stand, finally collapsed; part of the Sassanid army retreated in an organized manner while the rest retreated in panic towards the river. At this stage Jalinus took command of what was left of the Sassanid army and claimed control of the bridge head, succeeding in getting the bulk of the army across the bridge safely. The battle of al-Qadisiyyah was over, and the Muslims were victorious. Sa'd sent the cavalry regiments in various directions to pursue the fleeing Persians. The stragglers that the Muslims met along the way were either killed or taken captive. Heavy casualties were suffered by the Sassanids during these pursuits.  Aftermath  From this battle, the Arab Muslims gained a large amount of spoils, including the famed jewel-encrusted royal standard, called the Derafsh-e-KƒÅveyƒÅn (the 'flag of KƒÅveh'). The jewel was cut up and sold in pieces in Medina.Shahanshah: A Study of Monarchy of Iran By E. Burke Inlow, Inlow, E. Burke, p. 13 The Arab fighters became known as ‚Äò‚Äôahl al-QƒÅdisiyyah‚Äô‚Äô and held the highest prestige among later Arab settlers within Iraq and its important garrison town, Kufa. Once the battle of Qadisiyya was over, Sa'd sent a report of the Muslim victory to Umar. The battle shook Sassanian rule in Iraq to its foundations but was not the end of their rule in Iraq. As long as the Sassanids held their capital Ctesiphon, there was always the danger that at some suitable moment they would make an attempt to recover what they had lost and drive away the Arabs from Iraq. Caliph Umar thus sent instructions to Saad that as a sequel to the battle of Qadisiyyah, the Muslims should push forward to capture Ctesiphon. The Siege of Ctesiphon continued for two months, and the city was finally taken in March 637. Muslim forces conquered the Persian provinces up to Khuzistan. The conquest was slowed, however, by a severe drought in Arabia in 638 and the plague in southern Iraq and Syria in 639. After this, Caliph Umar wanted a break to manage the conquered territories and for then he wanted to leave the rest of Persia to the Persians. Umar is reported to have said: The Persian perspective, however, was the polar opposite: one of great embarrassment, humiliation, and scorn. The pride of the imperial Sassanids had been hurt by the conquest of Iraq by the Arabs, and the Sassanids continued the struggle to regain the lost territory. Thus, a major Persian counterattack was launched and repulsed at the Battle of Nahavand, fought in December 641. After that, a full-scale invasion of the Sassanid Empire was planned by Umar to conquer his archrival entirely. The last Persian emperor was Yazdgerd III, who was killed in 653 during the reign of the Caliph Uthman. His death officially marks the end of the Sassanid royal lineage and empire.

Medical use Delafloxacin is indicated to treat adults with acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) caused by designated susceptible bacteria or adults with community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) caused by designated susceptible bacteria. Susceptible bacteria for ABSSSI are: * Gram-positive organisms: Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant [MRSA] and methicillin-susceptible [MSSA] isolates), Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus lugdunensis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus anginosus group (including Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus intermedius, and Streptococcus constellatus), Streptococcus pyogenes, and Enterococcus faecalis * Gram- negative organisms: Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Susceptible bacteria for CABP are: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible [MSSA] isolates only), Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. It has not been tested in pregnant women. In the European Union it is indicated for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) in adults when it is considered inappropriate to use other antibacterial agents that are commonly recommended for the initial treatment of these infections. Adverse effects Like other drugs in the fluoroquinolone class, delafloxacin contains a black box warning about the risk of tendinitis, tendon rupture, peripheral neuropathy, central nervous system effects, and exacerbation of myasthenia gravis. The label also warns against the risk of hypersensitivity reactions and Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea. Adverse effects occurring in more than 2% of clinical trial subjects included nausea, diarrhea, headache, elevated transaminases, and vomiting. Interactions Like other fluoroquinolones, delafloxacin chelates metals including aluminum, magnesium, sucralfate, iron, zinc, and divalent and trivalent cations like didanosine; using this drugs with antacids, some dietary supplements, or drugs buffered with any of these ions will interfere with available amounts of delafloxacin. Pharmacology The half-life varies in around 8 hours at normal doses. Excretion is 65% through urine, mostly in unmetabolized form, and 28% via feces. Clearance is reduced in people with severe kidney disease. Delafloxacin is more active (lower MIC90) than other quinolones against Gram-positive bacteria such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). In contrast to most approved fluoroquinolones, which are zwitterionic, delafloxacin has an anionic character, which results in a 10-fold increase in delafloxacin accumulation in both bacteria and cells at acidic pH. This property is believed to confer to delafloxacin an advantage for the eradication of Staphylococcus aureus in acidic environments, including intracellular infections and biofilms. Chemistry The chemical name is 1-deoxy-1 (methylamino)-D-glucitol, 1-(6-amino-3,5-difluoropyridin-2-yl)-8-chloro-6-fluoro-7-(3-hydroxyazetidin-1-yl)-4-oxo-1,4-dihydroquinoline-3-carboxylate (salt). The injectable form of delafloxacin is sold as the meglumine salt of the active ingredient and its United States Adopted Name, delafloxacin meglumine, reflects that; the injection formulation also includes EDTA and sulfobutylether-Œ≤-cyclodextrin. The tablet is made of delafloxacin, citric acid anhydrous, crospovidone, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, povidone, sodium bicarbonate, and sodium phosphate monobasic monohydrate. History Delafloxacin was known as ABT-492, RX-3341, and WQ-3034 while it was under development. Rib-X Pharmaceuticals acquired delafloxacin from Wakunaga Pharmaceutical in 2006. Rib-X was renamed to Melinta Therapeutics in 2013. It was developed and marketed by Melinta Therapeutics (formerly Rib-X Pharmaceuticals), which subsequently merged with Cempra. Key clinical trials for delafloxacin have been performed by Melinta regarding indications for skin and skin structure infections as well as complicated bacterial infections and uncomplicated gonorrhea. The trial on gonorrhea was terminated before data was released. Delafloxacin was approved by the FDA in June 2017, after it was noninferior to vancomycin plus aztreonam in two trials on 1042 patients with acute bacterial skin and skin structure infection. New Drug Applications (NDA) for delafloxacin (Baxdela) 450 mg tablets and 300 mg injections were approved by the FDA in June 2017. The FDA obligated Melinta to conduct further studies as follows: * a 5-year surveillance study to determine if resistance emerges, with the final report due in December 2022 * a study of the IV form in pregnant rats to determine distribution to the reproductive tract, due June 2018, with further studies required if there is significant distribution. Melinta merged with Cempra in August, 2017. Melinta has entered into commercialization and distribution agreements with both Menarini Therapeutics (March 2017) and Eurofarma Laborat√≥rios (January 2015) for international commercialization of delafloxacin. The agreement with Menarini allows them to commercialize and distribute in 68 countries, including Europe, China, and South Korea among others. A similar agreement with Eurofarma allows for commercialization in Brazil.

He became known initially in his youth, during the Regency, by his liturgical reforms in the parish of Asni√®res-sur-Seine. He lived in exile during the second half of his existence, mainly in the Netherlands where he published most of his work. But it is the three years he spent in Russia under the reign of Peter II and Anna of Russia, which attracted the attention of his contemporaries and his principal biographer, historian Michel Mervaud. Jub√© resided in Moscow as a chaplain of Princess Irina Dolgorouki who had newly converted to Catholicism, and tutor to the children. The premature death of the young Tsar Peter II put an abrupt end to his projects. Expelled in 1732 by the Tsarina Anna, he has recorded jis experiences in Russia in a book entitled \\"Religion, morality, and customs of Moscow. This book is one of the few documents of the time describing in detail the customs and daily life in Russia during this period and is distinguished by its many illustrations from the hand of Jub√©.  Early life  Jacques Jub√© was born in Vanves on 26 March 1674. He came from a working-class family; his father was a laborer and launderer employed by Montargis, lord of Vanves.New church, 1746, pp. 169‚Äì172. He began his studies at the Society of Jesus and proceeded to study at Harcourt College. With financial support from the Lamoignon family, he joined the seminar of Saint-Magloire where great figures of Jansenism such as Laurent-Fran√ßois Boursier and Jacques Joseph Duguet were. Jub√© befriended his classmate Cornelius Johannes Barchman Wuytiers (1693‚Äì1733), the future bishop of the Old Catholic Church of Utrecht. In addition he showed a keen interest in Catholic theology and pursued a course at the Coll√®ge de France where he became knowledgeable in foreign languages, including Hebrew, Syriac and the Arab. Asni√®res He became a priest in 1696 and was assigned the church of Vaugrigneuse in 1698, then that of Asni√®res- sur-Seine in 1701.M. Pr√©vost, Roman d'Amat, et H.

It is used in large quantities by the chipboard industry and also by wooden boat builders for its high strength and durability. It is also used in joinery, veneering and general woodwork assembly. Aerolite has also been used for wooden aircraft construction, and a properly made Aerolite joint is said to be three times stronger than spruce wood. History Dr. Norman A. de Bruyne founded Aero Research Limited in 1934. The following year de Bruyne suggested that synthetic adhesives might play a part in aircraft production and engaged Cambridge University chemist R.E. Clark to investigate new adhesives for aircraft applications. The result was Aerolite, a urea- formaldehyde adhesive which unlike conventional glues of the time, resisted water and micro-organisms. Further research showed that gap-bridging hardeners incorporating formic acid enabled Aerolite to be used as an assembly adhesive. Aerolite was the first adhesive of its type to be invented and manufactured in Britain and used in resin-bonded plywood. When World War II broke out, the small company began to grow. Morris Motors used Aerolite and Aero Research's strip heating process to assemble Airspeed Horsa gliders, as did de Havilland on its Mosquito, as well as on other aircraft and also naval launches and patrol boats. On the Mosquito, Aerolite soon replaced the original \\"Beetle Cement\\" (known as \\"Kaurit\\" in Germany) synthetic resin adhesive used, after this glue was found not to stand up to the hot and humid climate in the Far East. Following the end of the war, in 1948 de Bruyne sold control of Aero Research to the Swiss company Ciba, but remained as managing director until 1960. Aerolite is currently marketed for use in boat building.

Set in a dystopian future, where the Moon is colonized and androids and clones are real, players take on the roles of murder investigators, investigating a murder within the fictional cities of New Angeles (a fictional future version of Los Angeles, but placed on the equator to accommodate a space elevator) and Heinlein, a colony on the Moon. Players attempt to gain Victory Points by solving the murder, solving the conspiracy, and/or resolving the investigators' personal issues. The player with the most Victory Points wins the game. Overview There is a murder. The players' goal is to prove their murder suspect is the guilty party. The Gameboard is made up of locations in the city of New Angeles and Heinlein separated into districts. One of these districts is the space elevator also known as The Beanstalk. In addition, the top right of the Gameboard contains the conspiracy puzzle that players also attempt to solve. Players travel about the gameboard trying to obtain the playing-pieces representing leads (clues to the murder). Traveling is done with a vehicle template unique for each vehicle (travel is limited on The Beanstalk). Leads allow characters to place evidence on suspects or investigate the conspiracy. Each player has one of five unique investigators, each with their own starting items and personal plots. The game is won by the player with the most Victory Points at the end. Victory Points are determined by correctly determining guilty and innocent suspects based in players suspect cards, uncovering the conspiracy and resolving players' personal plots, or all of the above, giving each game a unique strategy to win. Gameplay Each player chooses one of 5 unique characters: Louis Blaine, a crooked cop; Rachael Beckman, an in-debt bounty hunter; Floyd 2X3A7C, a Bioroid (a kind of android/cyborg) who is balancing his programming with his interest in humanity and his own attempts at \\"being human\\"; Caprice Nisei, a psychic clone who is trying to maintain her sanity and her knowledge of being a clone; and Ray Flint, a private investigator battling his inner demons of being a war veteran and addiction issues. Each player has a unique card or set of cards that each character has for the game (Example: Floyd has three Directive cards he must follow when playing, which represent his programming. In the course of play, he may be able to \\"humanize\\" himself and shed a Directive or two.) Players then choose a murder (either randomly or by vote). Each murder has up to 6 suspects (one more than the number of players). Players are then dealt hunch cards: one hunch card for a guilty suspect and one of an innocent suspect. No player has the same guilty or innocent suspect as another player, though a player can have the same suspect as both his guilty and innocent hunch‚Äîmaking the investigator \\"obsessed\\" with that suspect‚Äîand the potential to win bonus Victory Points if the suspect is determined to be far more likely to be guilty than the others. Players then start at locations determined by their character. =Rounds= Play is divided into days. There are 12 total days to investigate the murder; at the end of 12 days, the murder is solved. Each day is split up into investigator actions called Time. Each investigator character can have up to 13 Time to perform actions, but most investigators start with 6 Time. In a single Time investigators could do one of several things. Players can move their investigators from place to place, and the maximum distance they can move in 1 Time is determined by the vehicle they have (there are unique movement rulers resembling callipers of somewhat different sizes for each vehicle). The exception is The Beanstalk, in which an investigator must navigate through 5 areas (representing the Beanstalk and space shuttle trips), using 1 Time for each area to move between the Earth and the Moon. Investigators can investigate the murder or conspiracy for 1 Time (by Following Up a lead). Players can play Light Cards to give their investigator various bonuses, if they spend 1 Time. They can Draw or Discard Twilight Cards for 1 Time. They can move their investigator to the murder scene and make that investigator the first player in the next round (Getting a Jump on the Case). Or they can use a location's ability or event-based actions for varying Time depending on the event/action. =Board areas= Areas are labeled with both colors and symbols, colors determining the type of area it is, and a symbol determining whether it is ritzy (diamond), normal (circle), or seedy (triangle). Entering a ritzy location allows a player to draw one of their Light Cards; entering a seedy location allows them to draw one of the other players' Dark Cards. There are also major locations that can help players acquire certain game items (Alibis, Hits, Dropship Passes, etc.). There are also major locations that have special abilities that players can use. Players move about the board by use of the vehicle rulers which are unique to each investigator giving them a movement value; by dropship passes which allow players to move anywhere on the board for 1 Time; or by traveling the 5-location Beanstalk which costs 1 Time per location. =Following up leads= A player moving into an area containing a lead can choose to investigate that lead (which takes one Time unit). Investigating leads give players two options. The first is placing evidence on suspects. Evidence consists of tile; one side of the tile is a standard blank back, the other side is a number ranging from -4 to +5. A player draws a face-down tile then places this evidence upon one of the suspects face-down. The higher the number, the more guilty a suspect becomes; the lower the number, the more innocent. Additionally, there are evidence tiles that contain Surprise Witnesses (blue faces) which are equal to -5 and Perjury tiles (red faces) that eliminate the benefit of a Surprise Witness or Alibi and add +5. At the end of the game, the score on each suspect is added up via the evidence on their suspect sheet; the evidence tiles total determines guilt or innocence. Instead of placing evidence when following up a lead, a player can investigate the Conspiracy surrounding the murder. By doing this, a player can draw a piece of the \\"Conspiracy Puzzle\\" and place this puzzle tile within the Conspiracy area of the game board. Linking the puzzle tiles together via linkage lines on the tile links the Conspiracy to groups around the puzzle. Each link from one of the four sides of the central Conspiracy piece to a group gives Victory Point bonuses to all players who hold one of the four kinds of Favor pieces, successful Guilt or Innocence outcomes, or Happy or Sad endings to their plot lines. There are 3 different piles of Conspiracy tiles, giving the character placing them Shifts (on their Twilight Track, see below), Favors, or Baggage (more on Baggage below), and other items. Players can forego drawing a Conspiracy tile in order \\"Dig Deeper,\\" allowing their character to draw conspiracy tiles in the pile of the next higher value the next time they follow a Lead. Higher-value Conspiracy tiles therefore cost a greater number of followed Leads and will not be readily available to players early in the game. A player may choose not to play a tile (and in some cases a tile might not be able to legally fit anywhere in the puzzle), in which case the tile is discarded but the player still earns all items and bonuses shown on both sides. Once evidence is followed up, the player to the right of the investigating player moves that evidence to a new location. This can constantly change a player's ability to win the game. The new location must not be in this player's current \\"district\\", must not already have an evidence piece, and must be of the same color-coded building type as where it was first found (civic, religious, residential, business, or nightlife). =Twilight Cards= Each investigator has two unique decks of Twilight Cards: Light Cards and Dark Cards. Players are not allowed to draw their own investigator's Dark Cards. Players play their investigator's Light Cards for one Time during their turn, and their opponents can play the investigator's Dark Cards while that investigator is taking their turn. Light Cards are generally good events that can happen to the investigator, while Dark Cards are bad events. The other Investigators do not actually instigate bad events on a rival Investigator; the bad events are mainly caused by impersonal forces or non-player characters. Each player has a Twilight Track on their investigator card which has 5 positions. As Light and Dark Cards are played, characters shift from light to dark and move a Twilight Marker back and forth on the Twilight Track. Dark Cards move the Twilight Marker toward the lighter side of the chart, Light Cards move it toward the dark side. There is a constant balancing act to playing Light and Dark Cards. If a player does not have enough spaces on the Twilight Track to move in order to pay for the point cost of a card, they may also discard any Light or Dark cards to decrease the cost of the card by one point per card discarded. If a player plays a card which matches the color of the Plot Card currently on the investigator, they may decrease OR increase the cost of the card by one point. The motivation to increase the cost of playing one's card by 1 Shift has to do with easing the cost of an opposite type of card played in the future, by allowing greater room to Shift in the opposite direction. =Getting a jump on the case= A game round begins with the chosen First Player, and then goes clockwise among the remaining players. There are distinct advantages to being the First Player, who remains the First Player from round to round unless another player makes a deliberate change. By visiting the scene of the murder and spending one Time, a player makes themselves the First Player for the next round (the remaining players following clockwise.) =Plot cards= Each player also has a Plot for each week randomly chosen (with some exceptions for certain Investigators) from a pile of Plot Cards unique to each character. Players try to accumulate Good Baggage on their Plots, while opponents look for opportunities to place Bad Baggage on the player's Plots with Dark Cards or other abilities. At the end of three game days, Plots are determined to have ended well or badly (if the total number of Baggage is negative or zero, the Plot ends badly; if the total number of Baggage is positive, the Plot ends well). They then move on to the second half of the Plot (selecting the new Plot Card as directed). At the end of the 6th day of that week, Plots are resolved, and a player can earn Victory Points (or negative Victory Points) depending upon how the Plots resolve (\\"Happy Endings\\" or \\"Sad Endings\\"). For example, one of Louis's Plots deals with his failing marriage, and it could resolve in a number of ways, from him and his wife reconciling, his wife getting pregnant, or even a divorce or his wife getting killed. =End of the day= After each player takes his turn, the round ends. Either plots resolve (on Day 3, 6, 9, 12) or a General Event Card is drawn. On the beginning of Day 7 a Murder-Specific Event card is drawn. These events do a number of things, from changing a game mechanic, to putting an extra goal into play, to placing one of the character's acquaintances (a non-player character) on the board to accomplish a special function, or changing the murder situation entirely. =Victory conditions= At the end of the game, a murderer is determined by the suspect who has the highest point total of evidence. This earns the investigator with the correct Guilty hunch 15 Victory Points. Innocent hunches gain 5 Victory points. Various Victory Points are earned throughout the Conspiracy Puzzle and Plots so you do not necessarily have to get your Guilty hunch right to win the game. The player with the most Victory Points wins. Game mechanics and winning Unlike many games of this genre, there are no dice involved in the game. The game is determined by card play, and your ability to accumulate Victory Points in various ways. Some of the characters in the game are \\"better\\" at uncovering the Conspiracy, and gain more points and better game benefits by doing so. Some are better at solving the murder, and some are better at solving their particular Plot lines. This leaves a lot of different strategies to win the game, and solving the murder is not a guarantee you will win the game. Players attempting to balance both solving the murder, and solving the Conspiracy while trying to find out their opponents' hunches, throwing them off, and forcing them into bad Plot Endings generally win. Because of this the game is very replayable, and very open to future expansions. No character has an optimal way to win a game, because of the element of plots, which can change how to play a character, and the element of players playing Dark Cards against you. Players can also place hits on suspects to kill them, place Alibis on suspects, and some Twilight cards allow players to move around the leads on suspects, messing up an opponent's strategy. In addition, leads are constantly being moved around the board, forcing players to travel between Earth and the Moon and adjusting priorities and strategies. Because there are three separate mechanisms to gain Victory Points: resolving the murder, Plot Cards, and the Conspiracy Puzzle, it may be difficult for players to assess their relative standing at any point during the game. The game presents certain limitations which may frustrate new players. The murder is abstract; the \\"true\\" murderer is not definitely determined such as in a game of Clue. Investigators are seeking to prove their hunches and may even actively frame an innocent suspect. The connection between the murderer and the leads are not developed. This may possibly be justified by the cynical cyberpunk game-setting; by the fact that Investigators are credited in their employment for results, not necessarily truthful results; or the fact that the murder case is not the only focus of actions (similar to many police television shows where the personal lives of characters are dealt with as well). In a similar way, the Conspiracy aspect is abstract and presents no clear plot line as to why the influential groups wanted the murder victim killed. Possibly the full motivations are unknowable or covered up by outside pressures by these groups on the police force, again in the cyberpunk tradition.

He is linked to conceptual art. He moved to Havana to pursue his art studies at the famed Higher Institute of Fine Arts (ISA), graduating in 2002. Overview He has a university diploma as a painter but he has not painted anything for the last 10 years. He admires the conceptualist Marcel Duchamp but tries to distance himself from any traditional way of making art and also tries to stay free of any particular historical or cultural considerations that could obstruct his creativity. Havana is certainly a significant point of reference and a very important focus for him. His medium keeps changing, it depends on the particular idea or the concept he is working on and he never gets attached to any way of working. Most of the time, the missing elements in Prieto's work are obvious. In fact, in 2001, he did his most widely known work ‚ÄúApol√≠tico‚Äù with 30 flagpoles stripped of their familiar colours. This show has been shown in Ireland, Italy and France. In 2004, the more than 5,000 books that comprised his Biblioteca Blanca were utterly blank (White Library). This show went to the biennial exhibitions in Singapore and Venice, and will travel next to Austria. For the 2006 Havana Biennial, he contributed a rotting banana peel, a bar of soap and a daub of axle grease, which he placed in a neat little pile on a floor of the exhibition space. He tampers with the ordinary until it becomes unlikely but not entirely impossible. In 2006, he also transformed a Canadian art museum into a dance club, with disco lights, dance- floor, and everything except the music (Mute). In 2007, in a Barcelona gallery he once laid a rug in the middle of the floor, then carefully combed the gallery space for all the little bits of dirt and dust he could find, which he then swept under the rug (Untitled/Red Carpet). One of his most recent works is called \\"Walking the dog and eating shit\\", which was a number of public exhibitions he did in Lennon Park in Havana. Prieto recently won the 2008 Cartier Award, which entitles him to a three-month residency in London. He plans to use the time there to install a project he calls Estanque (Pond), which consist in covering the top of 100 oil barrels with a layer of water and serving as a makeshift habitat for a living frog.

Fatima was one of the many Turkish captives during the Battle of Buda. She was brought to the royal courts of Europe, including Sweden, Poland, and Saxony, and trained as a lady-in- waiting. Life=Early life= During the Imperial reconquest of Buda from the Ottoman Empire in 1686, soldiers of the Imperial army took the slaves and property belonging to the Turks. The Swedish baron Alexander Erskin, then in Austrian service, took four women: Raziye (Roosia); Asiye (Eisia); Emine; and Fatma (Fatima). Fatima claimed to have been the wife of a mullah (a Muslim clergyman). Baron Erskin returned to Sweden with Philip Christoph von K√∂nigsmarck, and gave Fatima to Philip's sister, Countess Maria Aurora von K√∂nigsmarck. The four women were baptised in Stockholm on 7 November 1686 in the presence of the royal court. Crown Prince Charles and Aurora von K√∂nigsmarck stood as Fatima's godparents, and she was christened Maria Aurora after Maria Aurora von K√∂nigsmarck. She was taught etiquette and French and became a companion to Aurora von K√∂nigsmarck. =Royal mistress= In 1691 she followed her mistress to Saxony and Poland, where Aurora von K√∂nigsmarck became the royal mistress of King Augustus. She was often present at the King's visits to Aurora von K√∂nigsmarck, and in 1701 she replaced Aurora as the royal mistress. Augustus married her in 1706 to Johann George Spiegel S√§chsisches Staatsarchiv, 11254 Gouvernement Dresden, Nr. Loc. 14516/30 who died in 1715 shortly before arrest at the Festung Sonnenstein. Augustus acknowledged his children with her, which he did not do with all of his mistresses, and seemed to have been in love with her. He often returned to her between his other relationships. She was the mother by King Augustus of Count Frederick Augustus Rutowsky and Countess Katharina Rutowska (born in 1706), who married Major-General Count Claudius Maria von Bellegarde (born in Piedmont, died in France in 1755), an ambassador to the court of Turin.N√∂thige Supplemente zu dem Gro√üen Vollst√§ndigen UNIVERSAL LEXICON Aller Wissenschaften und K√ºnste, Welche bishero durch menschlichen Verstand und Witz erfunden und verbessert worden. Dritter Band, Barc-Bod, Leipzig, 1752 =Later life= She remained a central character within the royal court after her relationship with Augustus ended, and was good friends with the influential Przebendowska, a relation of the favourite Count Fleming. At the king's death in 1733, she was given an allowance of 8000 thaler in his will.

In the U.S. state of Arkansas, the route runs from the Oklahoma border in Fort Smith east to the Tennessee border in Memphis. The route passes through several cities and towns, including Fort Smith, Clarksville, Russellville, Conway, Searcy, and West Memphis. US 64 runs parallel to Interstate 40 until Conway, when I-40 takes a more southerly route. Route description Bridge carrying US 64 over the Arkansas River in Van Buren Marion for the Trail of Tears at intersection of US 64 and AR 77 US 64 crosses Arkansas' western border over the Arkansas River, heading southeast into downtown Ft. Smith. Upon entry to Arkansas, the highway passes the Fort Smith National Historic Site, Ft. Smith Confederate Monument, Commercial Hotel and the West Garrison Avenue Historic District, all on the National Register of Historic Places. The highway turns northwest near the New Theatre, following the Arkansas and Missouri Railroad and concurring with US 71 Business onto 10th and 11th Streets. Westbound traffic runs on 10th St and eastbound traffic on 11th St past the Fort Smith Masonic Temple. Traffic converges onto Midland Boulevard. US 64 crosses the Arkansas River again near the American Doughboy Monument as it enters Van Buren on Broadway. US 64 passes the Van Buren Post Office before turning east onto Main Street, then northeast again becoming the Alma Highway. US 64 passes a former alignment, now designated as Oak St. After Oak St, US 64 crosses I-540 and continues east to Alma. US 64 closely follows Interstate 40 until Conway, while also closely following the Arkansas River, the Union Pacific Railroad, and the southern edge of the Ozark National Forest. US 64 continues through mountainous Franklin County, intersecting the Pig Trail Scenic Byway in Ozark. The route passes the Franklin County Courthouse, and the Ozark Courthouse Square Historic District in Ozark before exiting town continuing east. Route 64 passes a historically significant connector road in Wiederkehr Village before entering Altus and entering Johnson County. US 64 runs through Coal Hill and Hartman before curving northeast and crossing over I-40. The route continues to Clarksville, home of the University of the Ozarks. The route passes the Johnson County Courthouse, historic American Legion Hut, Clarksville Municipal Airport, and Lake Dardanelle before again crossing over I-40 and entering Pope County. US 64 then parallels Interstate 40, through Russellville and Morrilton. In Faulkner County, it briefly converges with U.S. Route 65B through Conway heading south before diverging from US 65 Business and Interstate 40 by turning east onto Oak Street. The highway next approaches Vilonia, following a southerly bypass around the city that opened in October 2011 (replacing its former alignment along Vilonia's Main Street) and rejoining its prior alignment west of the White County line and continuing to El Paso, where it intersects Arkansas Highway 5. US 64 then travels east to Beebe, where it originally entered town via Center Street and joined with US 67 and US 167. This former route along Center Street has since been resigned U.S. Route 67B, as all three US highways have been relocated to a concurrent divided highway northwest of Beebe. US 64 runs along this divided highway past McRae, Garner, and Searcy, where its original route took it north along Main Street, then east along Race Avenue. This former route is now signed U.S Route 67B. Later, US 64, 67, and 167 were rerouted southeast of Searcy along Eastline Road, which is now signed Arkansas Highway 367. Currently, all three highways continue to run northeast along a divided highway running parallel to Eastline Road. US 64 diverges from US 67 & 167 on the northeast side of Bald Knob, where its former route took it downtown along Highway Avenue, which is now signed Arkansas Highway 367. US 64 turns east toward the White River and Woodruff County, while the divided US 67 diverges northeast, and US 167 diverges north. US 64 runs near Altus. US 64 continues east through Augusta and McCrory, intersecting with US Route 49 at Fair Oaks and bypassing Wynne while in Cross County, and proceeding into Crittenden County through Earle and Crawfordsville, until joining with Interstate 55 at Marion. Its former route continued east along Military Road, turning south onto the Great River Road, and converging with US Route 63, which has since also been rerouted along Interstate 55. The former route is signed Arkansas Highway 77. US 64 is concurrent with US 67 and US 167 between Beebe and Bald Knob. US 64 continues south to West Memphis, where its former route entered the city from the north via Missouri Street, turning east (diverging from US 63 while converging with US 70 & 79) onto Broadway. Its current route turns east north of West Memphis as Interstates 55 and 40 briefly converge, before entering Tennessee (and downtown Memphis) along the Interstate 55 bridge. Each August, a large yard sale similar to the Highway 127 Corridor Sale takes place along of US 64 in Arkansas, in locations stretching from Fort Smith to Beebe.http://www.bargainsgaloreon64.com/ History The Arkansas River Valley has served as an east-west pathway across Arkansas for centuries, with travelers taking advantage of the flat natural topography between the Ozark Mountains and the Ouachita Mountains. When the United States Army began constructing the Memphis to Little Rock Road on January 31, 1824, it followed a historic trail through the region. =National Register of Historic Places= Four original segments of US 64 remain intact and are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Menifee segment was listed in 2006, the Scotia segment was listed in 2007, and the Van Buren and Altus segments were listed in 2010. The Horsehead Creek Bridge near Hartman was listed in 2014. Augusta Bridge in 1988 The original segment listings are contained within the Arkansas Highway History and Architecture Multiple Property Submission, which preserves history from Arkansas's highway building era between 1910 and 1965. The Horsehead Creek Bridge was listed within the Historic Bridges of Arkansas MPS. Two other bridges were NRHP-listed until their demolition: the 1920 Galla Creek Bridge near Pottsville was removed in 2000, and the 1930 Augusta Bridge over the White River was removed in 2002. Van Buren The Old US 64-Van Buren Segment is a stretch of historic roadway in Van Buren. Now designated Oak Lane, this stretch of concrete road was built in 1928 by Shultz Construction Co. as part of the original alignment of US 64, whose current alignment (built in 1968) travels to the south. This stretch of road is about long and wide, carrying two lanes of traffic with no shoulder. It is made out of a tan-colored aggregate mixed with concrete. This segment was part of the first concrete-paved road in Crawford County. Altus The Johnson County Line-Ozark-Crawford County Line Road, Altus Segment is a historic roadbed in Altus. It consists of a section of stone- paved roadbed, located on the north side of US 64 between Robin Way and County Road 515. The roadbed is about wide, with gravel shoulders, and has a small concrete bridge spanning a ditch. Built sometime between c. 1918 and 1931, it is the only known example of stone pavement in rural Arkansas. US 64 was redirected onto a new terrain roadway in 1931, leaving this segment as a nameless connector road. Horseshead Creek Bridge The US 64 Horsehead Creek Bridge is a historic bridge, carrying US 64 across Horsehead Creek east of Hartman. Its two main spans are Parker pony trusses, in length, with steel deck girder approach spans giving the bridge a total length of . The trusses are mounted on concrete piers, with the approaches on concrete piers and abutments. The bridge was built in 1933‚Äì1934 by Fred Luttjohann, and served as a major crossing point and transportation route until the construction of Interstate 40 (I-40) to the north. Scotia The Old US 64, Scotia Segment is a section of historic roadway in the unincorporated community of Scotia. It extends eastward from Country Lane, south of the current alignment of US 64. It is about in length, following an arced route, and is covered in a bituminous that has in places deteriorated into gravel. It is believed to be the longest-surviving element of the c. 1920 alignment of US 64 in Arkansas, and was built on an alignment dating to the 1830s. It is believed this road formed part of the Trail of Tears. Menifee Old U.S. Route 64 is a historic former alignment of US 64 in Menifee. Now a portion of Canal Road, it consists of a section of concrete pavement, extending southward from the current alignment of US 64 near the center of Menifee. Built in 1931 by the Zeigler Construction Company, it is the longest intact portion of the highway's original alignment in Conway County. It was bypassed by the present alignment in 1961.

In the U.S. state of Arkansas, the route runs from the Texas border in Texarkana northeast to the Missouri border near Corning. The route passes through several cities and towns, including Hope, Benton, Little Rock, Jacksonville, Cabot, Beebe, Walnut Ridge, and Pocahontas. Route description US 64 and US 167 between Beebe and Bald Knob. US 67 enters Arkansas from Texas in Texarkana, concurrent with US 82, along the one-way 7th Street; the other half of the one-way couplet, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard, carries traffic toward Texarkana, Texas. Upon crossing State Line Avenue, the two routes share a brief concurrency with US 71 before that route turns to the south along Hickory Street. Past this intersection, the one-way couplet merges onto 9th Street. Shortly thereafter, US 67 separates from US 82 and travels to the northeast along Broad Street, crossing Interstate 49 and passing Texarkana Regional Airport. US 67 then runs parallel to Interstate 30, passing through cities such as Hope, Prescott, Arkadelphia, and Malvern. Near Benton, US 67 merges with I-30. The two routes run concurrently to Little Rock, where the freeway also picks up US 65 and US 167. In North Little Rock, US 67 and US 167 turn to the east, concurrent with Interstate 40 for about , before branching off to the northeast as a freeway. In Beebe, the two routes begin a concurrency with U.S. 64. The three routes part ways in Bald Knob, with US 67 continuing as a freeway to the northeast. Just north of US 412 in Walnut Ridge, the freeway ends at a large, partially-complete interchange, and US 67 becomes a five-lane undivided highway north to Pocahontas. From Pocahontas, the road turns northeasterly and then easterly as a two-lane highway concurrent with US 62. In Corning, US 62 continues to the east while US 67 turns northward again before crossing the Missouri state line. History Original trace of the Southwest Trail, precursor to U.S. Route 67 in the area. The southwest-northeast bisector of Arkansas has always been an integral motor route. Prior to designation as US 67, the route was known as the Southwest Trail, an old military road around 1803. The Southwest Trail connected St. Louis, Missouri with Texas by steamboat in Fulton, Arkansas. The main railroad was built along the Southwest Trail, which developed many towns along the route. President Andrew Jackson appropriated money for the route in 1831, and designated it as a National Road. Although the route shifted slightly, it always has followed the natural break between the Ozark Mountains and the Ouachita Mountains and the Mississippi Alluvial Plain. Money for road maintenance was raised individually by county in the early 20th century, which hindered development of the route. In the 1920s, federal money became available, and the route was designated U.S. Route 67. The routing followed the Lakes to Gulf Highway and the Bankhead Highway. Federal designation brought paving to the route, which grew the small towns along the route. In early 2009, the Arkansas legislature passed a bill naming the portion of US-67 from the Missouri state line to Jackson County \\"Rock n' Roll U.S. 67\\" as a tribute to the route that many musicians of the 1950s and 1960s took as they traveled. Governor Mike Beebe stated that he had hopes that the naming would bring tourism to northeast Arkansas. Portions of the route, and also Arkansas Highway 7 between Hope and Hot Springs frequently used by Bill Clinton is designated The Highway of Hope by Arkansas Code ¬ß 27-67-220. =National Register of Historic Places= Several portions of the original late 1920s alignment of US 67 have survived, some of which are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. One listed segment is in Lawrence County, which is about in length, and runs north from Alicia to Hoxie, most of this being sandwiched between the present Arkansas Highway 367 and US 67, and the adjacent railroad tracks. Near the village of Village Creek Relief it briefly turns west, crossing Village Creek, and then rejoining the railroad tracks near the town of Relief. A second listed segment, also about in length, extends from Biggers in central eastern Randolph County, northeast to Datto in Clay County, and then straight north to a junction with Arkansas Highway 211. Mandeville Listed on the NRHP as Old US 67, Mandeville, a historic roadway section of US 67 is preserved in Miller County, Arkansas. It travels parallel to railroad tracks of the Union Pacific Railroad for from an intersection with Highway 237, just north of the Texarkana Airport, northeast to Miller County Road 63. The southern portion of this road is called Mandeville Road, and is designated Arkansas Highway 296. It is eventually redesignated Miller County Road 138, and is an unnamed side road of the current alignment of U.S. Route 67 (US 67) in its northernmost stretch. Built in 1929 out of concrete, it is the longest stretch of original pavement on the Old US 67 alignment in Miller County. The roadway was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004. Future Arkansas is upgrading US 67 to an Interstate-grade freeway from Little Rock to the Missouri state line, and the corridor is slated to become a southern extension of Interstate 57. The freeway currently runs from Little Rock to Walnut Ridge, but it is unknown when and where the freeway north of there to the state line will be constructed.

In the US state of Arkansas the highway enters the state from Louisiana concurrent with US 167 in Junction City. The highway zigzags through the state serving the major cities of Pine Bluff, West Memphis and Jonesboro. The highway exits the state at Mammoth Spring traveling into Missouri. US 63 shares many overlaps with other highways in Arkansas. This includes I-40 and I-55. Once the freeway section was extended further south to I-55 at Turrell, US 63 from there to Jonesboro became I-555.

In Mammoth Spring, US 63 crosses into Missouri, traveling to West Plains.US Highway 62 joins US 63 and 412 in Imboden History Portions of U.S. 63 in northern Arkansas have their origins in the work of the Ozark Trails Association, which established a network of roads in northern Arkansas and southern Missouri beginning in the 1910s. A portion of roadway was mapped out in Arkansas between Mammoth Spring and Memphis, Tennessee, and built c. 1918-22. This roadway was eventually designated Highway A-7, and was later designated U.S. 63. Some of the original infrastructure of this early construction has survived the 1927 Mississippi flood and the realignment of U.S. 63 in 1967. Northwest of Tyronza, Old U.S. 63 runs for about 1-1/4 miles of original concrete pavement; it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2009.

This area is characterized by intense volcanic activity and the sulphur springs field is full of mud lakes and steam pools with boiling mud. Industrial logging was attempted at the end of the 1980s, but is uneconomic. There are still several wells, one of which emits pressurized steam, visible in the morning up to 50 meters high. The major mud lakes are located at 4850m. The field is seismically active. Sol de Ma√±ana, together with El Tatio, is among the geothermal fields located at high altitude and is associated with the volcanic system of the Altiplano-Puna volcanic complex, as well as with a fault system that connects the two. Sol de Ma√±ana is part of the geothermal system of the Laguna Colorada caldera; Cerro Guacha and Pastos Grandes have been proposed to be the heat sources as well. This geothermal field has been investigated for the potential of geothermal power generation. The region of Sol de Ma√±ana is volcanic, with extensive exposure of Miocene-Pleistocene materials ranging from andesite to rhyodacite, as well as extensive faulting.

Fairview was established in 1907 as the State Institution for the Feeble-Minded. The hospital opened on December 1, 1908 with 39 patients transferred from the Oregon State Hospital for the Insane.Salem Online History Before its closure in 2000, Fairview was administered by the Oregon Department of Human Services (DHS). DHS continued to operate the Eastern Oregon Training Center in Pendleton until October 2009.  History =Early history= In 1907, the Oregon State Institution for the Feeble-Minded was created by the Oregon State Legislature. It was established as a quasi-educational institution charged with educating the \\"feeble-minded\\" (today known as people with intellectual disability and various other developmental and learning disabilities) and caring for the \\"idiotic and epileptic.\\" The facility was overseen by a Board of Trustees consisting of the Governor, Secretary of State and State Treasurer. Construction had progressed enough by 1908 that the first patients were transferred from the Oregon State Insane Asylum (now the Oregon State Hospital). They resided on a compound consisting of an administration building (LeBreton Cottage),Oregon Historic Photograph Collections a dormitory, a laundry and boiler house. By 1913, two more cottages were constructed and the Board of Trustees was replaced by the Oregon State Board of Control. In 1917, a commitment law was passed that was to standardize admissions to the institution by insuring that valuable space was used for the \\"feeble-minded\\" and not for the \\"insane\\". It also imposed an age limit on admissions to people five years of age and older. The age limit was removed in 1921. The institution had a working farm that provided both food and training for its residents. By 1920, most of the land to be used for farming had been cleared. were planted in crops and in orchards. The farm also raised hogs, chickens, and dairy and beef cattle. In 1923, the legislature established the Oregon Board of Eugenics, and Fairview's superintendent served as an ex-officio board member. The eugenics legislation provided for the \\"sterilization of all feeble-minded, insane, epileptics, habitual criminals, moral degenerates, and sexual perverts who are a menace to society.\\" Sterilizations required either the person's consent or a court order. By 1929, 300 residents had been sterilized. Two types of parole for residents were established in 1931: home parole and industrial parole. Requirements for parole included a surety bond filed by the parolee's guardian or overseer, who had to have a net worth of at least $1000 and have lived in the state for at least six months, the parolee had to be sterilized, and the home or workplace had to be inspected. Two- thirds of residents who had been sterilized were paroled, which freed up beds for new patients. In 1933 the facility was renamed Oregon Fairview Home. Changes in care and additions to the facility continued through the 1940s-1960s, and improvements were made to the medical care and nutrition of the residents. In 1965, Oregon Fairview Home was renamed Fairview Hospital and Training Center. In the late 1960s, the orchard, raising of beef, and general farm activities were eliminated. The raising of hogs was eliminated in 1975 and poultry processing ended in 1977. These activities had formerly provided all the ham, bacon, sausage, eggs, broiler chickens, and pork chops used by Fairview. In 1969, the Board of Control was dissolved and the Mental Health Division placed under the newly created Executive Department of the state government. In 1979, the facility changed its name from Fairview Hospital and Training Center to Fairview Training Center. =Modern history= Fairview was closed on March 1, 2000.

The character debuted on-screen during the episode broadcast on 26 January 2009. Gina is the older sister of Tony Holden and the mother to three sons; Hugo, Brendan and Xavier Austin. The character departed Home and Away on 18 April 2013, following Todd's decision to leave. Casting Todd made several guest appearances as Gina in 2009. In September of that year, it was announced that she had joined the regular cast after impressing Seven's drama executives. Todd told Inside Soap that she was largely attracted to Home and Away as it films in Sydney, where she lives. Character development Of Gina, the serial's official website said \\"Gina is a loving mother, and she knows she has made terrible mistakes with her eldest and youngest boys. But she did her very best [...] She's been worn down by the way her life unfolded, but blames no one and tries not to indulge in self-pity. It is what it is, and she just has to get by.\\" Soap opera reporting website Holy Soap describe Gina as a \\"down- to-earth, warm woman who has spent her whole life looking after her family at the expense of her own needs and desires.\\" Todd states the thing she likes most about Gina is the fact that she has three children that are all boys. In a 2011 interview, Todd explained that Gina had had a tough life and she was a bit downtrodden, but she had now grown nicely since her arrival. While interviewed by TV Week, Todd said Gina is \\"a mum struggling to bring up three boys whom she loves very much.\\" Her son Brendan (Kain O'Keeffe, suffers from learning difficulties. Todd said Brendan's disability is a \\"double-edge sword\\" because it puts a lot of \\"stress and pressure\\" on Gina, however, because of this the Austin's share a \\"close and lovely\\" bond. Todd revealed that Gina's husband Jeremy walked out on the family, which left Gina in a \\"fight or fight\\" situation which she manages to stay throughout. In one storyline Gina's eldest son, Hugo (Bernard Curry) is put into witness protection. When he breaks his cover, Gina, Xavier (David Jones-Roberts) and Martha MacKenzie (Jodi Gordon) are kidnapped by Killer (Mirko Grillini) and entrapped in a water vat. Luke Jacobz who plays Angelo Rosetta told TV Week the reason Hugo was put into protection was to keep Gina \\"out of the way of his many enemies\\". Network Seven used the storyline to keep viewers guessing who would die, by confirming there would be a death and refusing to reveal their identity. However, Gina survives. Gina and her husband, John (Shane Withington), began fostering Jett James (Will McDonald) in 2012. Todd noted that Jett came into Gina and John's lives at the right time, calling him \\"a much-needed light when their relationship was on the rocks.\\" The actress thought that Gina and John had found common ground in their need to care for Jett and their marriage became more stable. In April 2013, Todd departed Home and Away. She told TV Week's Carolyn Stewart that after four years on the show, she felt it was time to move on and pursue other acting challenges. Gina's final storyline saw her fall unconscious at the wheel of her car, during a family trip. Todd explained \\"Gina's eyesight starts to blur and she questions what she's seeing in front of her. It's a scary moment for John and Jett. They don't know what is happening and Gina also doesn't know what is happening to her own body. It all happens so quickly. One moment she is driving and the next she passes out and collapses in the car.\\" Digital Spy's Sophie Dainty said the moment would be \\"a devastating blow to the family\\", who had just learned that Jett's adoption had been approved.

Countess Catherine Charlotte De la Gardie (n√©e Catharina Charlotta Taube; 5 April 1723 ‚Äì 24 March 1763), also known as Catherine Charlotte de La Gardie, was a Swedish countess and courtier. She is famed for her support of the smallpox vaccination in Sweden, and for stopping the last witch trial in her country. Life Born to Count Edvard Didrik Taube of Odenkat and Kristina Maria Falkenberg, Catherine was the younger sister of the royal favourite Hedvig Taube, who was the royal mistress to king Frederick I of Sweden from 1731 to 1744. Catherine Charlotte served as hovfr√∂ken to Crown Princess Lovisa Ulrika from 1744 until 1748. Catherine Charlotte De la Gardie has been described as talented, brave, beautiful and clear sighted, without prejudices and with an open mind.Cath√©rine Charlotte De la Gardie (f.

After the wedding, she settled at Sj√∂√∂ Castle. =Pioneer of Smallpox vaccination= One of the two act for which she is most famed, is as a pioneer of smallpox vaccination. Her efforts to encourage the use of vaccination has sometimes been referred to as the breakthrough for smallpox vaccination among the public, and though this may be an exaggeration, she is known as an avid supporter of the then very controversial method.Cath√©rine Charlotte De la Gardie (f. Taube), urn:sbl:17374, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av B. Bo√©thius); h√§mtad 29 October 2013. (in Swedish) While baroness Katarina Charlotta Ribbing, the spouse of Charles De Geer, was in reality the first of the Swedish aristocracy to have her children inoculated, it was Catherine Charlotte De la Gardie who, after following the example of Ribbing by having her children vaccinated, became a pioneer by popularizing this method among the peasantry.Ellen Fries: M√§rkv√§rdiga qvinnor / Serie 2. Svenska qvinnor, (1890-1891) Project Runeberg Smallpox vaccination was officially introduced to Sweden in 1756, initially meeting with a great deal of resistance. De la Gardie is regarded as one of the pioneers of smallpox vaccination, as she actively sought to encourage the public to implement it.Cath√©rine Charlotte De la Gardie (f. Taube), urn:sbl:17374, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av B. Bo√©thius); h√§mtad 29 October 2013. (in Swedish) The resistance among the peasantry was great, but she managed to convince some parents of the peasantry to vaccinate their children, which allegedly caused a breakthrough in the willingness to use smallpox vaccination among the peasantry. Svenskt biografiskt handlexikon The children in question has, whether correctly or not, been referred to as the first Swedish children to be vaccinated.Wilhelmina St√•lberg, Anteckningar om svenska qvinnor (Notes of Swedish women) =Prevented a witch trial= The second act for which she is remembered was her successful efforts to stop the last witch trial in Sweden. In 1757, a witch hysteria broke out in the parish of √Öl in Dalarna, where thirteen women and five men were accused of abducting children and bringing them to a witches' sabbath. The governor Pehr Ekman ordered their arrest, interrogation and torture. De la Gardie became aware of the trial during a trip to Dalarna in 1758. By the help of her connections, she informed the authorities in the capital and thus managed to have the trial stopped. The matter had been treated by the local authorities and church, and when it became known in the country, it was treated as a scandal. While witchcraft trials was formally still legal in Sweden, the law was in practice considered defunct and witch trials a phenomenon of the past: no person had in fact been executed for witchcraft for half a century. The parliament issued an investigation, the accused were all freed, and Governor Ekman, who had accepted charges of witchcraft and had allowed torture, was sentenced to jail and stripped of his position. De la Gardie helped the victims of the witch hunt with legal assistance and made sure they were granted compensation from the state, as the torture had made them incapable of work. For this act, she was nationally hailed as a heroine and was in 1761 awarded a medal by Riddarhuset with the inscription: Catharina Charlotta Taube, comitissa De la Gardie, Fulcrum infelicibus, Ob XII ab injuria servatos cives Ordo R. Equ. 1761.Wilhelmina St√•lberg, Anteckningar om svenska qvinnor (Notes of Swedish women) The Latin inscription on the medal read in translation: :‚ÄúA source of help to those in need.

The last poem of Nordenflycht depicts the love triangle between Nordenflycht, Fischerstr√∂m and Catherine Charlotte De la Gardie, which took place during the winter of 1762/3, when Fischerstr√∂m was employed as an inspector at the estate of De la Gardie, Sj√∂√∂ Castle, while Nordenflycht rented a cottage nearby.√ñsterberg, Carin et al., Svenska kvinnor: f√∂reg√•ngare nyskapare (Swedish women: Predecessors, pioneers).

Many of them are old navigational aids, needed because of the remoteness of the moorland and its typically bad weather. Some mark medieval routes between abbeys. Other crosses were erected as memorials, for prayer, as town or market crosses, in churchyards, and as boundary markers.Harrison 2001, pp. 27‚Äì34 The crosses were erected over a long period of time, some as recently as 100 years ago, the earliest probably almost 1,000 years ago. In 2005, the Dartmoor National Park Authority had an ongoing project to microchip the most vulnerable of its granite artifacts, including crosses, to deter theft and aid the recovery of any that might be stolen. Legend Detail of Bennett's Cross There is a legend attached to the origin of the original crosses. The story says that there were four monks who did not want to follow their abbot's rules on austere living. Once the abbot went to Italy, the four brothers decided to celebrate, yet they needed some money. They robbed and killed a wealthy Jew. In the same evening the brothers were called to the nearby moor, which was covered in snow and ice at the time. When they reached the place, they realized that the messenger who had beckoned them was the ghost of the murdered Jewish man. The ghost hypnotized them, and they wandered into the mire, fell through the ice, and were sucked into the thick bog. The abbot, who knew nothing about the murder of the old Jew and assumed they had run off out of guilt when they saw him coming home, ordered that the crosses be erected to mark the tracks from one monastery to another to prevent future monks from getting lost. Notable crosses=Bennett's Cross= Bennett's Cross This cross is by the side of the road from Moretonhampstead to Two Bridges, about 900 metres north-west of the Warren House Inn. It was probably erected at this spot for two reasons: as one of the markers of this route long before the road was built, and to mark the boundary between the parishes of Chagford and North Bovey, which runs roughly along the same line as the road. Nothing is known of the early history of the cross, although its crude shape suggests that it is very old. It was later used as a boundary marker for Headland Warren (\\"WB\\" carved on one face stands for \\"Warren Bounds\\") and as one of the bounds of the mining sett of Vitifer Mine.Harrison 2001, pp. 243‚Äì246 Its survival here is probably due to its use as a boundary marker: two similar crosses further along the road towards Two Bridges are known to have been removed in the 19th century. The origin of the name is not known. In 1902, William Crossing, the well-known writer about Dartmoor, reported that it is mentioned in a document of 1702, where it is referred to in such a way as to indicate that it was already well- known.Crossing 1902, p. 145 It has been suggested that it may have been erected by the monks of a local Benedictine Order (\\"Bennet\\" was a common form of \\"Benedict\\") or it may be named after William Bennet, who was a miner who attended a Stannary Parliament on Crockern Tor in the early 16th century. =Cadover Cross= Cadover Cross Cadover Cross is located on Wigford Down, about 250 metres north-west of Cadover Bridge on the minor road between Plympton and Yelverton. Two important 12th century routes used the river crossing here: one leading from Tavistock to Plympton Priory, the other to Ivybridge via Cornwood, so it is likely that the cross existed then. The first documentary evidence for it is a mention as a boundary mark in 1381.Harrison 2001, pp. 111‚Äì112 The head of the cross was discovered by soldiers in 1873 and at the request of the vicar of the nearby village of Shaugh Prior they erected it on the spot where it was found. By 1901 it had fallen again and it remained so until 1915 when Hugh Breton, the vicar of Sheepstor, arranged for it to be re-erected on a new shaft. After searching for a suitable site to re-erect it, they dug a hole and fortuitously discovered the original socket-stone which they raised to ground level and re-used. Early 20th century writers described incised crosses on the faces of the cross, but they are barely visible today. =Crazywell Cross= Crazywell Cross Crazywell Cross is an ancient cross close to Crazywell Pool in southern Dartmoor. Like the cross patt√©e, the arms of the cross grow wider as they move away from the centre. It probably was used as a marker for the track (Monks' Path) from Buckfast Abbey to Tavistock Abbey. The head of the cross was found close to the north-east side of the pool by William Crossing.Harrison 2001, pp. 85‚Äì86 He believed that its original site was nearer to the track and it was fitted with a new shaft and set up there. In 1952 it was reported to the Dartmoor Preservation Association that the cross had been damaged again and it was repaired and the base made more secure. Many legends and superstitions surround the nearby area. It was said Crazywell Pool was bottomless and that waters of the pool were able to predict the next monk to die. There was also said to be a witch, who haunted the place and gave people bad advice. Legend says she advised Piers Gaveston, a possible lover of Edward II, to return to king's court after being banished to Ireland telling him that \\"his humbled head shall soon be high\\". Instead, he was captured by the king's enemies and beheaded and his head was set up on high battlements. =Goldsmith's Cross= thumb Goldsmith's cross is located in the Fox Tor Mire area between Childe's Tomb and Nun's Cross, on the Monks' Path. It was named for Lieutenant M. Lennon Goldsmith who discovered the socket, head and lower part of the shaft in 1903, making it the last major discovery of a cross on the moor.Harrison 2001, pp. 71‚Äì72 He reported his find to William Crossing whose detailed book on the crosses of Dartmoor had just been published.Crossing 1902 Crossing was unwilling to believe in its existence, so Goldsmith re-erected it with the help of four sailors from his ship. He passed the details to Crossing who conceded and included it in the 1910 edition of his Guide to Dartmoor. The cross is short and stumpy because the upper part of the shaft was never found. =Horn's Cross= Horn's Cross Horn's Cross is located on the lower part of Holne Ridge, east of the O Brook and south of Combestone Tor. It lies at the junction of the Monks' Path and a track used by moorland farmers that went from Hexworthy to South Brent. It is now the first moorland cross on the eastern end of the Monks' Path, though it is thought that another one used to exist nearer to the edge of the moor.Harrison 2001, pp. 49‚Äì50 In 1887, William Crossing wrote that the cross was badly damaged, with only the socket-stone and the head remaining. The head included a small part of the shaft and had only one arm complete. The cross has since been restored with a new shaft, though one of the arms remains mutilated and the iron tie-pieces holding the head to the shaft can be clearly seen. Near to the cross, along the crest of the ridge, are a series of low Bronze Age burial cairns and the remains of associated stone rows. The cairn closest to the cross (60 metres to the west) was excavated by Robert Burnard in 1905. According to him its central pit contained \\"a considerable quantity of charcoal and burnt bones, but no other relics\\". =Mount Misery Cross= Mount Misery cross Like Crazywell Cross, it was used to mark the Monks' Path between Buckfast Abbey and Tavistock Abbey. The name \\"Misery\\" was given to this place because of the harsh weather of this exposed corner of Fox Tor Newtake. When William Crossing first encountered this cross it was lying on the ground.Crossing 1902, p. 96 In 1879 it was standing, but was down again in 1881. Crossing assisted in its re-erection in 1885, and it remains standing today.Harrison 2001, pp. 61‚Äì62 The infamous Fox Tor mire in the vicinity of the cross became an inspiration for the Grimpen Mire, which Sir Arthur Conan Doyle described in his The Hound of the Baskervilles. =Nun's or Siward's Cross= Siward's cross This is the largest and oldest recorded cross on Dartmoor, being mentioned in the 1240 Perambulation of the Forest of Dartmoor.Harrison 2001, pp. 75‚Äì78 It was historically known as Siward's Cross, most likely in connection with Siward, Earl of Northumbria at the time of Edward the Confessor. Siward was Lord of the Manor of Tavei (probably today's Mary Tavy) and witnessed the founding charter of Exeter Cathedral in 1050. The derivation of its alternative name of Nun's Cross, which was first recorded as \\"Nannecross\\" in 1699, is unknown, but William Crossing suggested that it may be derived from the Cornu-Celtic \\"nans\\" or \\"nant\\" meaning valley or ravine.Crossing 1912, p. 105 The cross was probably erected during Edward the Confessor's reign (1042‚Äì1066), and stands at the junction of two main tracks across the moor: The Monks‚Äô Path and the Abbots‚Äô Way, both of which link Buckfast Abbey to Tavistock Abbey and Buckland Abbey. It was knocked down in 1846 and the shaft broken. It was restored in 1848 at the instigation of Sir Ralph Lopes. Both faces of the cross bear badly weathered inscriptions which have been the source of much speculation since the 19th century. One currently favoured theory is that the western face reads BOC LAND, marking the limit of the land owned by Buckland Abbey, though on a 16th-century map depicting the 1240 Perambulation it is recorded as ROOLANDE.Crossing 1902, p. 74 This face also has a cross carved on it above the lettering. The eastern face may read SIWARD or SYWARD. =Spurrell's Cross= Spurrell's Cross Located on Ugborough Moor, three miles north-east of Ivybridge, this cross is at the crossroads of an ancient east‚Äìwest track between Exeter and Plymouth, and the north-south Blackwood path that was once used by peat cutters.Harrison 2001, pp. 133‚Äì134 The cross is unique on Dartmoor for having spurred limbs of a type that were popular in the 14th century. It is badly damaged, only the head (missing one arm) being original. A well-preserved cross of the same design, but made of sandstone, is in the porch of the village church in Ermington, about four miles to the south. Spurrell's Cross was restored with a new shaft by the Dartmoor Preservation Association in 1931, but was later knocked down. It was re-erected by the same organisation in 1954. =Ter Hill crosses= Ter Hill ‚Äì the northeast cross There were two crosses on Ter Hill ‚Äî a southwest one and a northeast one. The southwest cross was badly damaged and found too fragile to stand at its original location. It was moved to the Jack Wigmore Memorial Garden (High Moorland Centre, Princetown). A replica of the southwest cross was erected on Ter Hill in 1994. The northeast cross was removed from its original place in the 17th century by a Mr. Coaker of Sherberton, who used it in his courtyard. Eventually the cross was returned to its original place and re-erected in 1885. Other crosses There are 132 known crosses within the National Park boundary, according to Harrison.Harrison 2001, p. 39 This is a list of a few of them. *Childe's Tomb *Fingle Bridge Cross *Harton Cross *Hexworthy Cross *Hobajohn's Cross *Huntingdon Cross *Maggie Cross *Petre's Cross *Southcott Cross *Sampford Spiney Cross *Shaugh Prior crosses *Sherwell Cross *Week Down Cross *Widecombe crosses *Widgery Cross Lost crosses A deed of Amicia, Countess of Devon dated 1280, in which she gifts lands to Buckland Abbey, mentions Siward's Cross (listed above) and five others, now lost: Copriscrosse, Wolewille, Maynstoncross, Smalacumbacrosse and Yanedonecross.Harrison 2001, p. 76 See also *High cross *Ridgeway (track) *Abbots Way Walk ReferencesSources  External links *Legendary Dartmoor *Dartmoor National Park Authority Ancient trackways in England Archaeological sites in Devon Buildings and structures in Devon Dartmoor Stone crosses in the United Kingdom Religion in Devon Monumental crosses in England ","title":"Dartmoor crosses"},{"id":"21266888","text":"Ghorbati is an ethnic group, a nomadic community in Iran and Afghanistan.

Description The building's most recent use is widely agreed to have been an assembly hall for Jews or Samaritans. However, the first use for the building is more controversial. While some people think the building was erected as a private house or a pagan meeting place, most believe that it was a synagogue even in its earliest form. Located on the eastern side of the city of Delos, the synagogue was far from the central areas of the city. Instead, the synagogue was built in a section of Delos called the Quartier du stade. In this part of the city, in contrast to the religious and commercial focus at Delos‚Äô center, residences dominated the scene (there was also a small, easily accessible port). The synagogue itself consisted of two large rooms containing a throne and multiple marble benches as well as many smaller rooms which allowed for access to a reservoir. Archaeology The synagogue was discovered in 1912 by a team led by archaeologist Andr√© Plassart. The synagogue is understood to have remained in use until the end of the second century AD.The Ancient Synagogue: The First Thousand Years, Lee I.

The hall is oriented towards the east, with a series of secondary rooms at the southern end. The identification of the building as a Jewish synagogue at any point in its history has been a matter of debate. The original identification of the building as a synagogue by Plassart was based in large part on dedicatory inscriptions referring to \\"Theos Hypsistos,\\" or \\"God Most High,\\" often considered an appellation for the Jewish God in antiquity, though not exclusively. The identification of the building as a synagogue was originally challenged by Belle Mazur in 1935,Belle D. Mazur, Studies on Jewry in Greece (Athens: Hestia, 1935). though this argument has gone largely unnoticed by more recent scholarship. The evidence of \\"synagogue's\\" architecture and inscriptions is complicated by the apparent presence of a contemporary Samaritan community not far.Philippe Brueneau, \\"'Les Israelites de Delos' et la Juiverie Delienne,\\" Bulletin de Correspondance Hellenique 106 (1982): 465-504. More recent studies have concluded that the evidence suggesting that this building was indeed a synagogue is tenuous at best and will no doubt remain an open question.Lidia Matassa, \\"Unraveling the Myth of the Synagogue on Delos ,\\" Bulletin of the Anglo-Israel Archaeological Society 25 (2007): 81-115.

Centered on the appearance of an adult version of the powerful mutant Franklin Richards, it is a sequel to the popular \\"Days of Future Past\\" story arc from The Uncanny X-Men #141‚Äì142 (January‚ÄìFebruary 1981). The storyline unites the Fantastic Four, X-Factor, the New Mutants, and the remnants of a then-disbanded X-Men against a common foe from a dystopian alternate future. It features the first appearance of Gambit, and the first encounter between Jean Grey and her alternate future daughter Rachel Summers. Cyclops' baby son Nathan Christopher Charles Summers and the full-grown mutant antihero Cable are depicted in this story as two separate individuals, although they are subsequently revealed to be one and the same.Cable #6 (December 1993). Plot summary=Part 1: Fantastic Four Annual #23= The Fantastic Four (Mr. Fantastic, the Invisible Woman, the Human Torch, the She-Thing, and Ben Grimm) and young Franklin Richards return to their headquarters at New York City's Four Freedoms Plaza to discover that it has been replaced by their previous headquarters, the Baxter Building. Upon investigating, they encounter a slightly younger version of the team from an alternate timeline. After the present-day FF is defeated in battle, an alternate adult version of Franklin reveals himself. Confused by the sight of the younger Franklin, the adult Franklin uses his mutant power to flee, restoring Four Freedoms Plaza with his departure. In doing so, his energy signature is sensed by Rachel Summers (who is in Great Britain with the team Excalibur), X-Men members Forge and Banshee (also in New York City), and a futuristic mutant-hunter named Ahab. After defeating a group of miniature Sentinel droids, the Fantastic Four (joined by Forge and Banshee) search for the adult Franklin at the home of the Power family. They find him there, but their efforts to reach out to the confused man fail, and he disappears. =Part 2: X-Factor Annual #5= Although labelled \\"Part 2\\", the events in X-Factor Annual #5 actually take place after The New Mutants Annual #6, which was released later and was labelled \\"Part 3\\". The adult Franklin observes the skyscraper-like extraterrestrial Ship which serves as X-Factor's Manhattan headquarters. Since the Ship is not in his memory of the past, he causes it to vanish. Having noticed the Ship's disappearance, Forge, Banshee and the Fantastic Four arrive, and team up with X-Factor (Cyclops, Jean Grey, Archangel, Iceman, and the Beast) to locate the adult Franklin. Above the Statue of Liberty, the adult Franklin encounters the woman who was his true love in his own time: Rachel Summers. Having journeyed to the present some time ago,New Mutants #18 (August 1984); The Uncanny X-Men #184 (August 1984). Rachel is now able to access the Phoenix Force.The Uncanny X-Men #199 (November 1985). She is confused, as she witnessed Franklin's death in the future at the hands of the Sentinels.The Uncanny X-Men #141 (January 1981). While the collective heroes protect the adult Franklin from a Sentinel attack, Jean Grey meets Rachel for the first time. Cyclops and Jean refuse to accept that Rachel is their daughter from a future where Cyclops's baby son (Nathan Christopher Charles Summers) does not exist. Rachel repels an attack from Ahab, who was her master during her many years as a Hound. Afterward, she flees the area, stung by her parents' rejection. The heroes are joined by the New Mutants (Sunspot, Warlock, Boom Boom, and Cannonball) and their new leader, Cable. They force Ahab to retreat. The adult Franklin returns after the battle. Noticing baby Nathan, who does not exist in his future timeline, Franklin causes the child to vanish. Cyclops collapses in shock and grief. =Part 3: The New Mutants Annual #6= Although labelled \\"Part 3\\", the events in The New Mutants Annual #6 actually take place before X-Factor Annual #5, which was released earlier and was labelled \\"Part 2\\". The adult Franklin travels to Professor Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters. Cable and the New Mutants (Sunspot, Warlock, Boom Boom, Cannonball, Rictor and Wolfsbane) are attacked by Franklin and an adult incarnation of the team, including Cypher, who was killed during a New Mutants adventure months earlier.New Mutants #60 (February 1988). After the New Mutants realize the future team was conjured by Franklin, he disappears. Banshee and the Fantastic Four arrive with the present-day Franklin, and the heroes are all attacked by Ahab and his Hounds. Appearing at the American Museum of Natural History, the adult Franklin remembers a futuristic Sentinel attack. In response, he lashes out with his power, destroying the Hounds in the present while the present-day Franklin watches. Horrified at the destructive nature of their powers, the two Franklins work in tandem to block young Franklin's power, ensuring that it can never be used again. Young Franklin lapses into a coma-like unconsciousness, and adult Franklin disappears. =Part 4: The Uncanny X-Men Annual #14= After their last encounter, Rachel and the adult Franklin reunite and rekindle their love for one another. They reappear at Four Freedoms Plaza, stating that they now have a second chance at happiness. When Reed & Sue Richards bring up the problems with Ahab, baby Nathan, and X-Factor's Ship, adult Franklin induces in them a euphoric, docile state of mind, allowing him to leave. Young Franklin, still unconscious, grows weaker. At Xavier's School, Cable and the New Mutants are joined by X-Men leader Storm and her new companion: a mutant named Gambit. Ahab transforms Cyclops and the Invisible Woman into Hounds, and uses them to locate and capture Rachel, the adult Franklin and baby Nathan. Meanwhile, Storm briefs the collective heroes on Rachel's dystopian future, where the Sentinels have conquered North America and almost all super-powered beings have been slain or imprisoned in internment camps.The Uncanny X-Men #141‚Äì142 (January‚ÄìFebruary 1981). The heroes track down Ahab and defeat him, but he flees into the future, leaving Cyclops and the Invisible Woman as hounds. Having learned from both Rachel and the Kitty Pryde of Rachel's timeline that Franklin is killed by the Sentinels in the future, Storm reasons that the adult Franklin is actually one of his \\"dream-selves\\", sent into the past at the moment of his death. To sustain himself, he has been subconsciously draining energy from his younger self and Rachel. Realizing that this would eventually kill them both, the adult Franklin releases the energies and allows himself to discorporate. The young Franklin regains consciousness with his latent powers intact, and Rachel uses the Phoenix Force to genetically restore Cyclops and the Invisible Woman to their natural forms. X-Factor's Ship reappears in Manhattan. However, the heroes are left with no way of determining if anything they have done will prevent the Sentinel- dominated timeline from coming to pass. However, Rachel still exists in her Hound uniform, leading her to believe that the future is unchanged. Jean reaches out to comfort her, but pulls back at the last moment. Devastated by this, Rachel departs, too upset to hear Jean's calls for her to come back. Later at her parents' house in Annandale-on-Hudson, New York, Jean studies the Shi'ar holempathic matrix crystal which Lilandra gave the Greys after Jean's supposed death.The Uncanny X-Men #138 (October 1980). The crystal is imbued with the essence of both Phoenix Force, and RachelClaremont, Chris (w); Leonardi, Rick (p). The Uncanny X-Men #201 (January 1986). Marvel Comics (New York) and Jean can learn everything she seeks to know about both of them simply by touching it. Filled with curiosity, fear and uncertainty, Jean wonders what she should do. Part 4.1: \\"The Fundamental Things\\" The events of this story take place between pages 10 and 11 of Part 4. X-Men Annual #14 contains a back-up story entitled \\"The Fundamental Things\\", written by Chris Claremont and pencilled by Mark Heikel. The story is set in Madripoor, where Wolverine (accompanied by Psylocke) tells his new teenage companion Jubilee about Charles Xavier and the X-Men. In the middle of the discussion, Rachel and the adult Franklin appear. Wolverine, who mortally wounded Rachel to prevent her from murdering the energy vampire Selene in The Uncanny X-Men #207, challenges Rachel's \\"the-ends-justify-the-means\\" method of confronting threats. Franklin causes Psylocke and Jubilee to vanish, as they are not part of his timeline. Wolverine lectures Franklin and Rachel on the virtues of the X-Men's ideals, and the need for the powerful to use their power responsibly and with restraint. Taking the man's words to heart, Franklin brings Psylocke and Jubilee back, along with baby Nathan. After Rachel and Franklin thank Wolverine for his advice, the two of them (and Nathan) disappear.

It records the way primitive nakedness has been challenged and the wearing of clothing enforced. It also catalogs events that have in their turn challenged the wearing of clothes to allow nudity within the public gaze.Young Spartans Exercising, depicted by Edgar Degas, Prehistory‚Äì1800 * 170,000 : Humans first wore clothing, a date suggested by evidence based on Lice DNA which shows when the clothing louse first began to diverge genetically from the human head louse.Study of lice DNA shows humans first wore clothes 170,000 years ago, physorg, January 6, 2011 by Danielle Torrent * 720 BC: According to one legend, an athlete, Orsippos of Megara who discards his loincloth wins his race at the Olympic Games. A variation of the legend asserts that the loincloth accidentally falls off a runner at the Olympics who trips on it, strikes his head, and dies. So for reasons of either improved athletic performance or for safety, ancient Greek Olympic athletes compete naked. * From in Sparta, both women and men occasionally went nude in certain festivals and exercise. The Adamites, a Christian sect that practiced holy nudity, date back to the 2nd century AD * 1st century AD: Historian Diodorus Siculus records that the Celts commonly fought naked in battle. Nudity is mentioned several times in the New Testament, although none of the examples give it the sexual meaning it carries today. For example, refusal to wear clothes could be a sign of insanity during this period. Nakedness was also used as a symbol of poverty or vulnerability. There are a few New Testament references to actual nudity, such as () in which a young man runs away naked from the Garden of Gethsemane, and () where Peter is described as naked while he is fishing. Some say that the term means semi- naked, arguing that it is unlikely that a Jew would go completely unclothed in public, although others argue that fishermen in the Sea of Galilee did actually work naked.Neil, James. (1913). Everyday Life in the Holy Land. * 100 AD to 18th century ‚Äì the Adamites, were adherents of an Early Christian sect that flourished in North Africa in the 2nd, 3rd and 4th centuries, but knew later revivals. They practiced \\"holy nudism\\", claiming that its members were re-established in Adam and Eve's state of original innocence. * 201‚Äì1500 AD: The first known liturgy of baptism, recorded by Saint Hippolytus of Rome in the early 3rd century, insists on complete nudity for all participants, even down to the removal of jewellery and hair fastenings. Baptism was later segregated by sex, as suggested by a scene depicted on a 5th-century lead font, but still conducted on an unclothed participant. Christian groups, including the Adamites, Carpocratians, Aquarii, and Marcosians all practiced social nudity.One or more of the preceding sentences incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Chisholm, Hugh, ed.

Cambridge University Press. p. 174. * 393 AD: Students in ancient Greece exercised and received instruction naked and athletes competed naked. This tradition ended in 393 AD, when the Christian Emperor Theodosius I bans the Olympic Games because he considers them Pagan. *632 AD Quran teachings transmitted by Muhammad impose 'modest dress' on men and women. * : Leofric, Earl of Mercia, imposed a heavy tax burden on the citizens of Coventry, England, to support his grandiose public works. According to legend, his wife Godgyfu begged him to reduce the tax, and he told her that she had to ride naked through the city's market before he would do it. Godgyfu, remembered as Lady Godiva, accepted the challenge. * In Kamakura-period Japan (1185‚Äì1333), religious bathing was provided to the public free of charge, with no concept of gender segregation.

In an 1874 entry, Kilvert notes being brought \\"a pair of very short red and white striped drawers to cover my nakedness\\" after he had finished bathing at Seaton, and being so \\"unaccustomed to such things and customs\\" that he had \\"set at nought the conventionalities of the place\\".Cec Cinder.

The 'Q' Services were vastly expanded during the Second World War, providing numerous services for the combatant forces, including the provision of petroleum, oil and lubricants (POL), rations, ammunition, stationery, clothing and equipment and other supplies, as well as providing transport through a large number of motor transport (MT) companies. Duties also involved the running of numerous establishments such as field bakeries and butcheries. By April 1941, 'Q' Services had already deployed more than 7,000 men for the East African Campaign alone. After the war, pay was also handled by the Corps. The 'Q' Services Corps was replaced by the Administrative Services Corps (ASC) in November 1949. The ASC was responsible for supply and transport services other than armament and technical stores. Insignia right Helmet flashes were worn by the Union Defence Forces from the early 1900s until the early 1940s. The flash was worn on both sides of the Wolseley helmet and on the upturned left brim of the smasher hat. As helmets and smasher hats were superseded by berets during the Second World War, the system therefore lasted for only about twenty years, though some flashes were later adapted for wearing on berets.South African Heraldry website The standard pattern flash, introduced in 1923, was rectangular, 75mm high and 50mm wide. Flashes of Permanent Force (PF) units displayed the branch colours, while those of Citizen Force (CF) units displayed a provincial colour at the top, the branch colour at the bottom, and unit colours in the centre. The flash for the 'Q' Services Corps was red, white and blue as shown alongside.
