They also owned the prosperous Midlothian Coal Mining Company located 5 miles distant in Chesterfield County. A large three-story hotel was designed by architect John Notman. In addition to the hotel, multiple cottages were built to accommodate guests. Opened on July 1, 1847, the resort became very popular with the eastern Virginia planters and businessman, as before 1847, the nearest springs with a resort were located at least one hundred miles away in the western parts of the state. Huguenot Springs was only 17 miles away. When the Civil War broke out, the hotel building was converted to a convalescent hospital for Confederate soldiers. Around 250 soldiers are buried in unmarked graves in the cemetery there. In 1890, the hotel burned down. Today, the only remains of the resort are the foundation of the hotel and the old cemetery.

Prior to being elected to the state assembly, he was the Mayor of West Covina, a member of the West Covina City Council, and Professor of Government at Rio Hondo and Citrus Community Colleges. Prior to his tenure on the City Council, Hern√°ndez was elected to the Rowland Unified School Board where he served from November 1999 through July 2003. He lost his bid to return to the West Covina City Council on Nov. 6, 2018, coming in fourth.  Early life and education  Hern√°ndez received a degree in Political Science from the University of California, Riverside, a master's degree in Public Administration from the University of La Verne and a Master's in Governance Certificate from the California School Boards Association (CSBA). Hern√°ndez was raised in El Monte and attended Nogales High School. As a youth counselor in La Puente, Hern√°ndez worked with at-risk teenagers in an after-school program.  Career  In 1998, at the age of 23, Hern√°ndez was elected to the Rowland Unified School Board and implemented community service graduation requirements as well as a parent empowerment program. In 2003, Hern√°ndez was elected to the West Covina City Council. Hern√°ndez was elected to the California State Assembly in 2010 representing the 48th District. As an Assemblymember for 6 years, Hern√°ndez passed 34 bills, and co-authored Senate Bill 3 which raised California's minimum wage to $15 an hour. Hern√°ndez's petition for divorce in 2014 only after a year of marriage claiming \\"irreconcilable differences\\" in court documents. Hern√°ndez was legally separated from his estrange wife for about a year before the domestic violence allegations according to court documents (http://www.lacourt.org/casesummary/ui/index.aspx?casetype=familylaw). After being served with a restraining order for domestic violence during divorce proceedings and during his run for his congressional campaign, Hernandez was stripped of his committee assignments. A few months later, he took a medical leave of absence. 2014 California State Assembly  2016 run for Congress In 2016, as he was termed out of his Assembly seat, Hern√°ndez ran for the United States House of Representatives in the 32nd district, challenging Grace Napolitano. In August, after gaining a spot in the general election following a 2nd-place finish in the primaries, Hernandez withdrew from the race, citing fallout from his controversial divorce.  Controversies/Criminal Arrest  Divorce: December 2014 Hernandez petitioned for divorce, only a year after marriage claiming \\"irreconcilable differences\\" http://www.lacourt.org/casesummary/ui/index.aspx?casetype=familylaw). December 2014 Hernandez was legally separated and the divorce did not finalize until 2016. Active Restraining Order: On July 1, 2016 State Assemblyman Roger Hernandez was ordered to stay 100 yards away from his ex-wife Baldwin Park Councilwoman Susan Rubio for three years as part of a permanent domestic violence restraining order issued against him by a Los Angeles County Superior Court judge during the couple‚Äôs divorce proceedings. The decision came after Judge Shelley Kaufman heard testimony from both parties and six other witnesses during a hearing drawn out over five days in May, June and July. In court testimony and a written declaration seeking the restraining order, Rubio, an elementary school teacher, described more than a dozen incidents in which Hernandez allegedly punched, choked and assaulted her during their relationship. When issuing the restraining order, which expires July 1, 2019, Kaufman said the testimony Rubio provided in court was credible and that it was clear abuse occurred on multiple occasions. In 2007, West Covina police responded to Hernandez's home after a neighbor reported hearing a loud argument and \\"someone getting slammed around with a male and female yelling,\\" but no charges were filed, these allegations were also made during Henandez's re-election to the West Covina city council. Hernandez claimed that the allegation was politically motivated. The former West Covina public information officer and city manager sued Hernandez alleging a hostile work environment in 2012, which was rejected by a jury. Hern√°ndez was arrested for drunk driving in Concord, California on March 27, 2012. A jury later found him not guilty. In January 2015, he was charged with money-laundering by the California Fair Political Practices Commission after a probable cause finding that Hernandez's campaign committee had filed \\"an inaccurate semi-annual campaign statement with the Secretary of State, falsely reporting information regarding the true sources of contributions received.\\" In April 2016, while in the process of divorcing his estranged wife Susan Rubio, Hernandez was served with a temporary restraining order and ordered to have no contact with Rubio. Rubio, who serves as a councilmember in the City of Baldwin Park, claimed that during their marriage Hernandez physically attacked and assaulted her, providing photos with scratches and bruises. In August of the same year, Hernandez took a leave of absence but was criticized for continuing to collect per diem reimbursements while on leave.

Academic and Scientific Career Laroussi's research interests are in the Physical Electronics area, particularly in the applications of non-equilibrium gaseous discharges. Amongst these are the generation of large volume low temperature plasmas, the interaction of microwaves with plasmas, and the biomedical applications of cold plasmas, a field known as ‚ÄúPlasma Medicine‚Äù. In the latter, he published seminal papers on the interaction of low temperature plasmas with biological cells. In plasma medicine research, low temperature plasmas (or simply cold plasmas) are used to inactivate bacteria and proteins, assist in wound care, destroy some types of cancer cells, and play an active role in various other medical therapies. In 2009 the Institute of Electric and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) elevated Laroussi to Fellow for his contributions to the biomedical applications of plasmas[3]. Laroussi's best known invention is the Plasma Pencil. This device can generate long plumes or jets of cold plasmas that can be used in various biomedical applications, including in dentistry. The Plasma Pencil was the subject of wide media coverage including a mention in an article in National Geographic (February 2006 issue), and ABC online news. It was featured in science/technology shows on the History Channel and the Smithsonian Channel.

Most of Rappaport's research made use of echinoderm embryonic cells to address the mechanisms of cytokinesis in animal cells, experiments that focused on understanding how the cytokinetic furrow is positioned, and understanding the nature of the stimulus from the mitotic spindle that induced cortical furrowing.Ray Rappaport Chronology: Twenty-Five Years of Seminal Papers on Cytokinesis in the Journal of Experimental Zoology, by Thomas D. Pollard, J Exp Zool 301A:9-14 (2004) With few exceptions, his research was conducted alone or with his wife. Rappaport's research was marked by unusually creative and simple experimental design, often involving physical manipulation of individual cells, for which he devised a number of custom microsurgical tools. Rappaport recognized mechanistic redundancy in cytokinesis, which he characterized in an address at a 2004 conference with, \\"When I began working on cytokinesis, I thought I was tinkering with a beautifully made Swiss watch, but what I was really working on was an old Maine fishing boat engine: overbuilt, inefficient, never-failed and repaired by simple measures.\\" Rappaport died December 14, 2010 in Bar Harbor, Maine at the age of 88.

From 2010 to 2016 she served in the California State Assembly representing the 12th district and serving as the Assembly Minority Leader. Prior to being elected to the State Assembly, she was a member of the Modesto City Council. Olsen is a Republican and lives in Riverbank.  Background  Olsen was elected to the Modesto City Council in 2005, and re-elected in 2009. While on the City Council, Olsen served as a member of the Safety & Communities Committee and as Vice Chair of the Finance Committee. Prior to this Olsen served as Vice Chair of the Finance Committee and was a member of the Safety & Communities Committee. In addition to serving on the City Council, Olsen directed marketing and communications programs as Assistant Vice President for Communications & Public Affairs at California State University, Stanislaus. Furthermore, Olsen has served on the Modesto Citizens Housing and Community Development Committee, as well as on the Modesto City Planning Commission. Olsen served as the Vice-Chair of the California Republican Party for a brief time in 2017. Olsen resigned from the position citing \\"personal and professional obligations\\" that would not allow her to effectively help lead the party. Olsen showed questionable judgment in September 2018, when she was detained for a DUI infraction. She apologized on Twitterhttps://twitter.com/KristinOlsenCA/status/1040380696366403587, calling it an 'inadvertent, careless mistake,\\" she served half-night of jail sentence and was allowed to complete community service hours. https://www.modbee.com/news/local/crime/article222720970.html She did not make any public contributions to MADD to indicate atonement in her apology or subsequent statements.  Stanislaus County Board of Supervisors  As a member of the Stanislaus County Board of Supervisors, Kristin Olsen has worked on a variety of issues including developing more reliable water infrastructure, improving county health services and alleviating homelessness. As a Supervisor, Olsen was appointed to represent the County on the Commission of the California County Tobacco Securitization Agency, North County Corridor Transportation Express Authority, San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District Board of Directors, and the Stanislaus County Remote Access Network (RAN) Board. After leaving the State Assembly and joining the Board of Supervisors, Olsen became a board member for California Women Lead, which is a nonpartisan organization that recruits and trains women to run for elected office. She also serves on the supervisory (audit) committee of the Valley First Credit Union and the board of New Way California.  California State Assembly  Olsen was elected to the California State Assembly in 2010. She received the plurality of votes in the June Republican primary contested by six candidates.United States of America. California Secretary of State. California Secretary of State. By Debra Bowen. California Secretary of State, June 8, 2010. Web.

California Secretary of State. California Secretary of State. By Debra Bowen. California Secretary of State, November 2, 2010. Web. August 10, 2011. <>. Olsen was praised for being one of eight Republican Assembly Members to release her office operating budget during a controversy between the Speaker of the Assembly John A. Perez and Assemblyman Anthony Portantino. Portantino had alleged that Speaker Perez reduced the operating budget for Portantino's office in retaliation for his \\"no\\" vote on the 2011-12 State budget. Portantino went on to release his office spending to the public while Perez and the Assembly Rules committee refused to release the budgets for all of the Assembly despite Public Record requests from newspapers. Olsen was one of the first Republican members that responded by releasing their office spending in defense of the principle of government transparency. The Sacramento Bee and Modesto Bee, among other newspapers, praised Olsen for being willing to open her budget to public scrutiny claiming that citizens deserve the right to know how their money is being spent. Olsen was named a 2014 Aspen Institute Rodel Fellow.  Legislation  During 2012, Olsen introduced a controversial bill that would ban teachers from having romantic relationships with a student regardless of whether the student was over 18, the age of consent in California. Teachers who violated the ban could face prosecution for a felony and lose their state funded retirement pension. The bill was in response to a Modesto high school teacher who left his wife and children for one of his students following her 18th birthday. While the proposed bill received a substantial amount of media coverage, the bill ultimately failed to get any votes in the Assembly Public Safety committee and was defeated. Olsen introduced the Legislative Transparency Act during the 2012 Legislative Session which would have required potential legislation to be reviewable online for public viewing at least 72 hours prior to being voted on. Olsen's bill would have stopped the popular practice utilized by Assembly and Senate Democrats where legislation is introduced and passed simultaneously thus nullifying the normal vetting and public review process. This process has been utilized to pass bills with wide ranging and substantial policy effects in recent years. Assembly Democrats defeated the bill in the Elections Committee hearing on a 2-2 vote with 2 committee members abstaining.

The natural oscillation frequency of the moving parts is carefully tuned to a specific frequency; commonly 50 or 60 Hz. Higher frequencies up to 1 kHz are possible. Since the frequency depends on the mass of the moving elements, high frequency vibration galvanometers are very small with light coils and mirrors. The tuning of the vibration galvanometer is done by adjusting the tension of the suspension spring. The vibration galvanometer is used for detecting alternating currents in the frequency of its natural resonance. Most common application is as a null indicating instrument in AC bridge circuits and current comparators. The sharp resonance of the vibration galvanometer makes it very sensitive to changes in the measured current frequency and it can be used as an accurate tuning device.W. J. M. Moore, W. J. M. Moore P. N. Miljanic The Current Comparator IET, 1988 pp. 41-42  Frequency display  A 50 Hz ¬±5 Hz vibrating-reed mains frequency meter for 220 V The frequency-sensitive behaviour of the galvanometer allows their use as a crude frequency meter, commonly used for adjusting the speed of AC generator sets. The galvanometer is constructed as a number of moving-iron galvanometers, sharing the same excitation coil. As each is tuned to a slightly different frequency, one of them will resonate at a time, according to the input frequency. The magnets are conveniently constructed as a single iron 'comb' of individual reeds, each of different length. Their range is typically from around 45-55 Hz (for a 50 Hz base frequency), with around 2 Hz resolution between each. As it is the identity of the vibrating reed (and thus frequency) that is of interest, rather than its amplitude, these are not calibrated. They are often viewed end-on, as the clearest viewpoint for the whole comb.

There are also a few English retirees and pensioners who choose to live in the country after retirement, currently numbering up to 1,000. Many British firms are active in Turkey; consequently, many British employees working in Turkey are originally stationed by companies and multinational corporations back home, and can be seen serving in capacities such as general managers, marketing consultants and financial directors. They tend to be involved in sales, marketing, technical and human resources departments. The majority of Britons are found in Istanbul, with smaller populations scattered throughout the capital Ankara. Istanbul is generally seen as a favourite location due to the city being the country's commercial capital, the presence of international schools and better air links with the UK. British residents living in smaller urban centres are mainly occupied in the textile and energy sectors. Turkey remains one of the top tourist and investment destinations for British nationals. The towns of Didim, Fethiye, Marmaris, Bodrum and Antalya are hot spots for Britons in Turkey. According to statistics, a record 32,000 Britons own property in Turkey, surpassing all other foreign property buyers. The properties range from holiday residences to private beaches centred on popular resorts. Social and business life Many community and business organisations are active. One business organisation is the British Chamber of Commerce, which supports British businesses in Turkey. In 2008, a poll was conducted among retired British expats in Turkey, with the question being whether they would approve of Turkey's accession to the European Union. The results showed a great number replying in the negative, citing concerns that doing so may cause Turkey to lose its identity and culture. The poll showed that many Britons are attracted to Turkey because of its not being as Europeanized, as well as its favourable climate, cheaper standards of living, the social circles and less pressure in daily life.

Another Democratic challenger was Connie Perez, an accountant in Pasadena, California, who grew up in Tulare, but due to issues regarding her residency outside of the district, as well as an alleged recent change in party affiliation, Perez dropped out less than a month after announcing her candidacy. In January 2016 Emilio Huerta, son of United Farm Workers co- founder Dolores Huerta, announced his candidacy in the race as a Democrat. In the June 7 primary Valadao finished first with 54% of the vote and Huerta finished second with 24.2%.

But in March 2018 Huerta suspended his campaign for lack of funds. After Huerta's withdrawal, engineer T. J. Cox of Fresno announced that he would challenge Valadao. Cox had previously announced a challenge to Republican Congressman Jeff Denham in the 10th district before switching to Valadao's seat. Valadao declared victory on November 6 after the Associated Press initially called the race in his favor, but the counting of mail-in ballots gave Cox a very narrow lead. Cox officially won the race on November 28, and Valadao conceded on December 6. The final count showed that Cox won by 862 votes.

Between 2017 and 2018, he voted in line with Donald Trump's stated position 97.9% of the time. Vote Smart Political Courage Test According to Vote Smart's 2016 analysis, Valadao generally supported pro-life legislation, opposed an income tax increase, opposed requiring states to adopt federal education standards, supported lowering taxes as a means of promoting economic growth, supported the building of the Keystone Pipeline, supported government funding for the development of renewable energy, opposed the federal regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, opposed gun-control legislation, supported repealing the Affordable Care Act, opposed requiring immigrants who are unlawfully present to return to their country of origin before they are eligible for citizenship, opposed same-sex marriage, and supported increased American intervention in Iraq and Syria beyond air support.  Donald Trump  After Donald Trump became the presumptive Republican presidential nominee in May 2016, Valadao said he would support his candidacy. He rescinded his support in June 2016, declining to endorse Trump and saying he could not support a candidate who \\"denigrates people based on their ethnicity, religion, or disabilities.\\" In February 2017, Valadao voted against a resolution that would have directed the House to request ten years of Trump's tax returns, which would then have been reviewed by the House Ways and Means Committee in a closed session. FiveThirtyEight found that, as of September 2018, Valadao had voted in line with President Trump's stated position 99% of the time.Tracking Congress in the Age of Trump, accessed September 25, 2018 Environment In 2014, President Obama blamed a drought that California began experiencing in 2011 on global warming. According to The Hill, Valadao was among Republican candidates in three swing districts in California who said \\"climate change has nothing to do with the drought.\\" Valadao argued that regulations by the Obama administration had worsened the drought.  Food stamps  In 2013 Valadao was one of 15 House Republicans to vote against a Republican-backed bill to make deep cuts in food stamp spending.  Healthcare  Valadao favored repealing the Affordable Care Act. On May 4, 2017, he voted to repeal it and to pass the American Health Care Act (AHCA). He was one of three co-sponsors of a last minute amendment that added $8 billion to fund high risk pools for patients with pre-existing conditions. The revised version of AHCA allowed states to get waivers to allow insurers to charge individuals with preexisting conditions more if the individual has had a gap in insurance coverage. In June 2017 Valadao and Jeff Denham (CA-10) introduced the Assessing Critical Care Efforts to Strengthen Services (ACCESS) Act. It would correct California's Medicaid reimbursement method in order to encourage physicians to operate in the Central Valley and to ensure patient access to doctors and specialists.Ibarra, Ana; Calif.

In 2015, Valadao did not sign a Supreme Court brief co- signed by hundreds of conservative politicians in favor of same-sex marriage.  Immigration  Valadao supports comprehensive immigration reform. In August 2014 he broke ranks with the Republican Party and voted against a bill that would have dismantled the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. On February 23, 2017, Valadao called for a bipartisan solution to the U.S. immigration system.

This is the southeastern San Joaquin Valley and much of Mojave Desert, including Ridgecrest, Taft, Tehachapi, Barstow, Tulare, Visalia, and part of Bakersfield. She was favored in the race against Republican Gregory Tatum, a church pastor, and Democrat Ruth Musser-Lopez, an archaeologist and former Needles council member, and easily won the election.Obernolte, Ramos win Assembly seats, Victorville Daily Press (November 7, 2018).Laura Lanfray, Shannon Grove claims state senate seat, Renegade Rip (November 9, 2018). In January 2019, Grove was elected by her Senate Republican colleagues to serve as their leader. In this role, Grove leads the 10-member Republican caucus in the California State Senate, where the Democrats enjoy a supermajority. Record and political views Grove is a conservative and outspoken Donald Trump supporter; she once called herself a \\"gun-carrying, tongue-talking, spirit-filled believer.\\" =Public health= Grove opposed mandatory vaccination of schoolchildren. In September 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic in California, Grove addressed a large prayer gathering in front of the California State Capitol, where few of the thousands present wore masks or socially distanced. Grove appeared on the stage and addressed the meeting without wearing a mask and while under a state-ordered quarantine. She was one of nine Republican state senators who had been in close contact with state Senator Brian Jones, who had tested positive for COVID-19.Limits on large gatherings in Sacramento were not applied to prayer event at state Capitol, Los Angeles Times (September 8, 2020). =Education= Grove introduced a bill in 2015 that would mandate that California public colleges and universities allow student organizations to maintain belief-based requirements for its members and leaders. The bill targeted the California State University system's \\"open membership\\" or \\"all-comers\\" policy, which bars student organizations from imposing belief-based criteria for membership and leadership. =Social issues= Grove has introduced anti-abortion legislation into the Assembly, which did not pass.California Abortion Law Targeting Asian Immigrants Fails, LA Weekly (May 7, 2014). Grove opposed legislation passed by the Assembly in 2015 in response to misinformation at crisis pregnancy centers (CPCs). The law required CPC to disclose whether they were licensed, and required the posting of notices stating that \\"reproductive health services, including abortion, are available to pregnant women and may be financed under government programs.\\" Grove argued that the legislation is unconstitutional.Fenit Nirappil, California bill compels abortion notice at pregnancy centers, Associated Press (May 26, 2015). In June 2016, Grove attracted attention and criticism after linking abortion legislation and the wrath of God to the drought in California.Jeremy B. White, Shannon Grove under fire for linking drought to abortion, Sacramento Bee (June 12, 2015). While speaking to a group of anti-abortion activists at an event in Sacramento, Grove brought a copy of the Bible to the platform and stated that: \\"Texas was in a long period of drought until Gov. [Rick] Perry signed the fetal pain bill. It rained that night.\\"Hailey Branson-Potts, Did Kern County legislator suggest link between God, state drought and abortion?, Los Angeles Times (June 16, 2015). Grove's remarks sparked a backlash and were criticized as \\"patently ridiculous\\" by NARAL Pro-Choice California, an abortion rights group. Grove responded to criticism by saying that she had been misconstrued. In a Facebook post following the speech, Grove wrote: \\"Is this drought caused by God? Nobody knows. But biblical history shows a consequence to man\\"s actions; we do know for sure that California‚Äôs water shortage crisis has been compounded by liberal politicians' poor decisions ‚Äî not properly managing our water resources and refusing to build water storage for decades.\\" Grove opposed the aid-in-dying legislation (S.B. 128) passed by the California State Legislature, saying: \\"Suicide should never be used as a legitimate way to end human suffering. Although promoted as a compassionate option for the terminally ill, this bill will have a corrupting influence on public and private healthcare providers looking for ways to reduce the cost of end of life care.\\"Shannon Grove speaks out against Assisted Suicide bill (press release), California State Assembly Republican Caucus (January 21, 2015).

Grove states in the video: \\"Our children are going to lose this blessing if water policy in California does not change. California's bread basket, which feeds this nation and the world, will be destroyed.\\" Grove is a staunch critic of California's high-speed passenger rail (bullet train) project, and has accused the California High-Speed Rail Authority of obscuring cost overruns.Theo Douglas, High-speed rail agency declines further response to Grove's allegations, Bakersfield Californian (November 6, 2015). Grove has called the project a \\"train to nowhere\\" and believes that it is too costly and disruptive to farmland.Assemblywoman Shannon Grove Responds to Assembly Passage Of Reckless High Speed Rail Spending (press release), California State Assembly Republican Caucus (July 5, 2012). Grove has called for reducing regulation of the fossil fuel industry. She has opposed efforts to combat climate change, calling such measures unaffordable.Jeremy B. White, Lawmakers send Jerry Brown scaled-back climate change measure, Sacramento Bee (September 11, 2015). In 2012, Grove invited Lord Monckton, a well-known climate change denier, to speak to the Legislature, although only five of 120 state lawmakers attended the talk.Shannon Grove, California legislature should keep an open mind on climate change policy, Bakersfield California (April 7, 2012). Grove opposes regulation of hydraulic fracturing (fracking), arguing that the technology is safe and that environmental critics of the practice are wrong.Scott Shafer, Open Arms Greet Fracking in Kern County, KQED (October 10, 2014).Shannon Grove speaks out against anti-fracking bill, California State Assembly Republican Caucus (May 31, 2013). Along with several other legislative Republicans, Grove has sponsored legislation to exempt gasoline, diesel, and natural gas from California's cap-and-trade program. =Economic and labor policy= Grove opposes prevailing wage legislation for workers on public-works projects, and has introduced legislation to roll-back prevailing- wage requirements; this legislation was defeated in committee on a party-line vote.Bob Balgenorth, Facts don't support Grove in debate over prevailing wage, Bakersfield California (June 20, 2011).Shannon Grove promotes two bills to reform state construction wage laws and spur job creation (press release), California State Assembly Republican Caucus (January 4, 2012). In February 2016, Grove introduced two pieces of legislation (A.B. 2753 and A.B. 2754) to require California public-employee unions (such as SEIU Local 1000) to post itemized budgets online and to hold ratification elections every two years.Jon Ortiz, Bills would force unions to open books, ratify representation, Sacramento Bee (February 23, 2016). Grove sponsored legislation to amend California's Private Attorneys General Act (PAGA) of 2004, which allows workers to sue (as private attorneys general) employers who fail to properly pay workers or commit other labor law violations. Grove specifically sponsored legislation that would, among other things, limit the scope of PAGA suits, cap the financial penalty to violations, and provide a time period for a business owner or corporation a right to cure a violation.Rodric Hurdle-Bradford, Private attorney general lawsuits are 'absurd' and 'out of control,' say reformers, NorCal Record (May 5, 2016). Grove argued that PAGA suits had grown out of control,Shannon Grove seeks to reform PAGA, KGET-TV (April 1, 2015). saying: \\"These PAGA laws benefit a lot of Los Angeles lawyers who come in from other districts to legally rape and pillage business owners in my district.\\" Grove has sought to reduce the state's minimum business tax. =Social services= Grove has opposed providing financial assistance to poor families struggling to afford diapers for infant children. Grove has advocated for the closure of two state developmental centers, which care for Californians with developmental disabilities. Grove became interested in the issue after learning about \\"abuse, neglect and lack of supervision\\" leading to 13 deaths at the centers, reported in an investigation by California Watch in 2013. Grove has introduced legislation to close the centers and shifting the developmentally disabled residents to nonprofit community-based care, which Grove argues will be cheaper and have stronger oversight than institutional settings. Grove's legislation was opposed by family members of center residents (who say that forcing their loved ones to move would be disruptive), and by center employees (who note that state-run centers are more expensive because they offer more comprehensive services than community-based nonprofits, and that the rate of abuse in community settings is unclear because of looser reporting requirements for abuse in such settings). Grove supports increased funding for developmental disability services, saying: \\"Now we're in a critical crisis stage where programs are closing.\\" =Other= In 2011, as a first-term assemblywoman, Grove advocated changing the California State Legislature from a full-time to a part-time body. She sought to place an initiative on the California ballot to reduce its annual legislative session from nine months to three months (90 days) and cut lawmakers' annual salaries from $95,000 to $18,000.Jim Sanders, Shannon Grove releases video pitch for part-time CA Legislature, Sacramento Bee (February 16, 2012). Grove pitched the idea in a four-minute video produced by a Tea Party group in 2012.

Penetrants, or penetrating items, are the mechanical, electrical or structural items that pass through an opening in a wall or floor, such as pipes, electrical conduits, ducting, electrical cables and cable trays, or structural steel beams and columns. When these items pierce a wall or floor assembly, they create a space between the penetrant and the surrounding structure, which can become an avenue for the spread of fire between rooms or floors. Modern building codes generally require a service penetration firestop to seal the openings around penetrants (or \\"services\\"), in order to restore the fire-resistance rating of the parent assembly. Sizing of all openings has significant impact upon the adherence to the certification listing requirements. Therefore, communication between all affected trades is of great importance before any openings are made, to ensure proper sizing of the openings for cost control and conformance with listing and approval use and compliance. Penetrants are typically accommodated by plumbers and electricians, who prepare for them by installing sleeves in concrete walls and floors, before they are poured. In the case of masonry walls, electricians and plumbers tend to be there first and hang sleeves around their piping, ductwork and conduit, where they know from their drawings that block walls will be erected, in order to avoid the time and expense of having to cut openings in existing walls and floors. In the case of drywall assemblies, the opening size is determined by the drywall contractor, unless the mechanical and electrical trades are contractually obliged to provide sleeving here as well, with proper fastening methods that are in conformance with the certification listing. It is not uncommon for these trades to attempt to absolve themselves of the requirement to firestop their openings in the drywall assemblies by claiming that they were there first, meaning that others should take care of the rest. Since drywall contractors are not ordinarily required to do mechanical and electrical firestopping, the drywall openings can become an item of dispute or neglect, particularly in North American construction. This common issue can be minimised by designating a separate firestopping sub-contract, whereby a separate speciality sub-contractor firestops all openings on site, mechanical, electrical and structural, as well as the building joints. Timber floor openings are simply cut by means of a chainsaw. In this case, the width of the blade will determine sizes.

As a result, the field was significantly larger than in the past; Achadjian's competition included two other Republicans (both of whom, Justin Fareed and Matt Kokkonen, are former candidates for the same district in previous years), two independent candidates (including another former candidate, Steve Isakson), and four Democrats (including Santa Barbara Mayor Helene Schneider and Santa Barbara County Supervisor Salud Carbajal). Achadjian received endorsements from many prominent Republicans in the region, including Santa Barbara City Councilmen Frank Hotchkiss and Dale Francisco (the latter of whom was also Santa Barbara County Republican Chair, and had previously run for the same district in 2014), and former actor Christopher Mitchum, the previous Republican nominee for the seat who lost to Capps in 2014. In the lead-up to the primary on June 7, Achadjian raised roughly $750,000 in the congressional race. Although he was only the fourth-highest fundraiser in the race, he was generally considered to be the primary frontrunner due to arguably having more name recognition among voters than any other candidate, from either party. Polls released both by his own campaign and the Schneider campaign predicted that Achadjian would come in first in the open primary. However, despite this, he came in a narrow third with 27,545 (18.9%) total votes, only 1.6% behind Justin Fareed, who finished a distant second to Carbajal. Fareed went on to lose the general election to Carbajal.

It was established in 1953 by a decision of the Moetzes Gedolei HaTorah (Council of Torah Sages of Agudath Yisrael in Israel) and implemented through the State Education law. It was initially led by Rabbi Zalman Sorotzkin and now is run by an umbrella center that operates a large network of schools, kindergarten thru high school, gender-separated, throughout the country. By 1978 there were 300 of these schools in Israel ; by 2003 that number grew to 800. Overview The diverse nature of Israel‚Äôs society is accommodated within the framework of the Israeli education systems. Different sectors of the population attend different schools. Although parents are comforted by the fact that their children‚Äôs school may more or less reflect their basic worldview, this separation results in very little contact among the various segments of Israeli society. Schools are divided into five groups: * State schools (mamlachti), attended by the majority of the pupils; * State religious schools (mamlachti dati), which emphasize Jewish studies, tradition and observance; * Independent religious schools (Chinuch Atzmai) which focus almost entirely on Talmud Torah and offer very little in terms of secular subjects; * Private schools which reflect the philosophies of specific groups of parents (Democratic Schools) or are based on a curriculum of a foreign country (e.g. The American School); and lastly, * Arab schools, with instruction in Arabic and a focus on Arab history, religions and culture. There are approximately 80,000 77,000 in 2009: students currently enrolled in Chinuch Atzmai schools, which include Beis Yaakov schools for girls, Talmud Torah, Cheder and Yeshiva Ketana for boys. There is a strong emphasis on Jewish studies in these programs. Funding and operation The schools are partially supported by the State; however, the Ministry of Education is not responsible for the hiring and firing of teachers or for the registration of pupils. Schools in the Chinuch Atzmai system are allocated 55% of the budget that regular state schools receive and are required to teach 55% of the Ministry of Education's curriculum. Chinuch Atzmai's funding has traditionally been supplemented by donations from outside Israel, particularly the United States. Rabbi Aharon Kotler, one of the movement's founders, was extremely instrumental in fundraising for the organization. Due to sharp cuts in state funding over recent years, the movement has had to redouble its efforts in order to keep schools from closing. Controversy The center was a main focus of the controversial Court ruling against the Beit Yaakov school in Immanuel in summer 2010, when it was fined for not complying with the court's ruling.http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3655796,00.html External links References Education in Israel Orthodox Jewish educational institutions Haredi Judaism in Israel 1953 establishments in Israel ","title":"Independent Education System (Israel)"},{"id":"30109329","text":"Green Movement may refer to: * Green politics, a political ideology ** Green Movement in India ** Ukrainian Green movement ** Green Movement of Sri Lanka ** The Green Party (Israel), a social-environmental political party formerly known as the Green Movement * Iranian Green Movement, a series after the 2009 Iranian presidential election ","title":"Green Movement"},{"id":"30109339","text":"Opostega radiosa is a moth of the family Opostegidae.

However it has renounced them and pledged to only use its nuclear technology for peaceful purposes following the Treaty of Tlatelolco in 1968. In the 1970s Mexico's national institute for nuclear research successfully achieved the creation of highly enriched uranium which is used in nuclear power plants and in the construction of nuclear weapons. However the country agreed in 2012 to downgrade the high enriched uranium used on its nuclear power plants to low enriched uranium, the process was realised with the assistance of the International Atomic Energy Agency. It is unknown if Mexico ever created or possessed nuclear or any other kind of mass destruction weapons. Nuclear energy in Mexico through history Mexico has been using technologies such as X-rays since late 19th century, evidence of the use of various radiations and radioisotopes for medical activities since the 1920s exist, practice that strengthen during the next decades alongside the use of industrial scintigraphies. Given its huge importance, the investigation of nuclear sciences formally began in the late 40s with two fields of interest: energetic and non-energetic applications and the study of nuclear sciences. The CNEN (Mexico's Nuclear Energy National Committee) started nine programs: nuclear physics, education and training, seminaries, reactors, radioisotopes, industrial applications for nuclear energy, agronomy, genetics and radiologic protection. During the sixties, the most relevant scientific project on the country was the construction of the Salazar Nuclear Center in the state of Mexico, which started in 1964. Two years later, the center already possessed a Tandem Van de Graaff particle accelerator and in 1968 a TRIGA Mark III. In 1972, the CNEN changed its name to ININ (National Institute for Nuclear Research). However, regardless of the new name, its objective remains the same until today. Official attitude to nuclear weapons In 1961 the Mexican government argued that use of nuclear weapons could not be justified under the right to self-defence in the UN charter. Six years later the country would sign the Treaty of Tlatelolco in which Mexico and several other Latin American countries agreed not to manufacture nuclear weapons and to limit its nuclear technology for peaceful purposes only. In 2000, Mexico was one of 7 nations launching a declaration \\"Towards a Nuclear Weapon Free World: The Need for a New Agenda\\" calling for further action to implement the provisions of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. In April 2010, the Mexican government reportedly reached an agreement to turn over its highly enriched uranium to the United States. The US would help convert highly enriched uranium stored at Mexican research facilities into a less enriched form unsuitable for weapons, thus eliminating all highly enriched uranium in Mexico. Later in March 2012 Rachel Maddow reported that all highly enriched uranium had been removed from Mexico. In October 2010 Mexico signed a contract with the Russian uranium supplier Rosatom, which will supply low enriched uranium (3%, a level of enrichment unsuitable for weapons) for the Mexican nuclear power plant Laguna Verde. In 2012 Mexico was admitted into the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) as an observer state, which the US claimed as an achievement in preventing nuclear proliferation.

Unlike a current-measuring galvanometer, the moving part has a large moment of inertia, thus giving it a long oscillation period. It is really an integrator measuring the quantity of charge discharged through it. It can be either of the moving coil or moving magnet type. Ballistic galvanometer calibration setup. Grassot fluxmeter, a form of ballistic galvanometer. Grassot fluxmeter calibration arrangement using a standard mutual inductor and a known quantity of electrical discharge. Measuring setup is similar. Before first use the ballistic constant of the galvanometer must be determined. This is usually done by connecting to the galvanometer a known capacitor, charged to a known voltage, and recording the deflection. The constant K is calculated from the capacitance C, the voltage V and the deflection d: K=CV/d where K is expressed in coulombs per centimeter. In operation the unknown quantity of charge Q (in coulombs) is simply: Q=kd. Grassot Fluxmeter The Grassot Fluxmeter solves a particular problem encountered with regular galvanometers. For a regular galvanometer, the discharge time must be shorter than the natural period of oscillation of the mechanism. In some applications, particularly those involving inductors, this condition cannot be met. The Grassot fluxmeter resolves this problem, by operating without any restoring force, making the oscillation period effectively infinite and thereby longer than any discharge time. Its construction is similar to that of a ballistic galvanometer, but its coil is suspended without any restoring forces in the suspension thread or in the current leads. The core (bobbin) of the coil is of a non-conductive material. When an electric charge is connected to the instrument, the coil starts moving in the magnetic field of the galvanometer's magnet, generating an opposing electromotive force and coming to a stop regardless of the time of the current flow. The change in the coil position is proportional only to the quantity of charge. The coil is returned to the zero position manually or by reversing the direction of the current.

It is an over the counter drug, which is made from selected herbs. The medicine is said to have no side effects due to its herbal composition and is based on the Unani concept of medicine. It's available across India in many medical and general shops. Zinda Tilismath was made during the Nizams rule in Hyderabad, for which it acquired the Nizams crown (Dastaar) as its trade mark. The Marketing logo was the face of an Salman which was symbolic of good health and trust. This got associated with Zinda Tilismath because during the Nizams regime, Habeeb was in the Nizams security forces and his overall physique was the sign of good health, strength and Trust, henceforth it was used as the marketing logo by its founder Ahmed Abdul Mujeeb Hazari for Zindatilismath.

According to Stepanos Orbelian's History of the Province of Syunik (Patmutyun Nahangin Sisakan), in the mid-4th century Prince Andovk, the hereditary lord of Syunik, attacked and plundered one of the cities of the Persian Sassanid King Shapur II (309-379) while the king was at war with the Huns. King Shapur II was furious about the incident and took his armies to Syunik to defeat the prince. Andovk and his troops went to Baghaberd with a large supply of provisions and waited. Once the king's forces arrived at the fortress, Andovk and his men defeated three of Shapur's military units by rolling rocks down the cliffside upon them. Prince Andovk soon fled to Constantinople and his subjects scattered. When he arrived, he was given honors by the Emperor Theodosius I showered him with great honors.

She also followed Tessin to Berlin, where Prince Augustus William of Prussia is reported to have fallen in love with her. On 18 February 1748 she married royal Crown Forester Count Carl Reinhold von Fersen and became the mother of Ulla von H√∂pken and Augusta von Fersen. During her stay in Paris, she studied dance under Marie Sall√©, which she in turn taught her daughters, who were to become famous for the grace and talent within dance in the amateur theater of Gustav III.Gunilla Roempke (1994).

Maid of honor Sparre was, with the Count and Countess Tessin, a part of the entourage which accompanied Louisa Ulrika of Prussia from Prussia to Sweden upon her marriage to the Swedish Crown Prince Adolph Fredrik in 1744, and she served as a maid of honor to Louisa Ulrika in 1744-48. During her tenure as maid of honor, she and her future spouse were described as the first stars of the amateur theater of the royal court, which consisted of amateur actors from the court nobility and who performed French plays at court from the autumn of 1744 until at last the arrival of the Du Londel Troupe in 1753.Nils Personne: Svenska teatern : n√•gra anteckningar. 1.

During the summers of 1767 and 1768, she tried to reconcile the Crown Prince couple to consummate their marriage at Ekolsund Castle, which first seemed successful, but eventually failed. During these attempts, she blamed the Crown Prince for his infatuation in Charlotte Du Rietz. By Hedvig Elisabeth Charlotte of Holstein-Gottorp she was described as a pleasing but eccentric character, lazy while her spouse was frivolous, and not one to meddle in intrigues. She was present at the baptism of the Crown Prince in 1778 and at the delivery of the Queen in 1782. However, her health and increasing weight caused her to spend more time in retirement in her rooms and her position as courtier was a mere formality when she eventually lost the position in 1795, which made her daughters leave court in solidarity with her. She was succeeded in her post by Countess Hedvig Catharina Piper, who had informally already served in this capacity for several years.

Parataxonomy may be used to improve taxonomic efficiency by enabling more expert taxonomists to restrict their activity to the tasks that require their specialist knowledge and skills, which has the potential to expedite the rate at which new taxa may be described and existing taxa may be sorted and discussed. Parataxonomists generally work in the field, sorting collected samples into recognizable taxonomic units (RTUs) based on easily recognized features. The process can be used alone for rapid assessment of biodiversity. Some researchers consider this process prone to error depending on the sample, the sorter and the group of organisms in question. Therefore, quantitative studies based on parataxonomic processes may be unreliable and is therefore controversial. The term is attributed to Daniel Janzen who used it to describe the role of assistants working at INBio in Costa Rica. During the time period that Janzen's parataxonomic model was in place, INBio became the second largest biological collection in Latin America with over 3.5 million collections, all of which were digitized. As of 2015, the institute had produced over 2,500 scientific articles, 250 books and 316 conventions. Its website logged an average of 25,000 unique visitors daily from 125 countries, and its park had received upwards of 15 million visitors. Today, the concepts of Citizen science and parataxonomy are somewhat overlapping, with unclear distinctions between those employed to provide supplemental services to taxonomists and those who do so voluntarily, whether for personal enrichment or the altruistic desire to make substantive scientific contributions. These terms are occasionally used interchangeably, but some taxonomists maintain that each possess unique differences.

Early life The son of a British American Tobacco executive from North Wales, Mostyn was born in Nigeria, and grew up there and in Venezuela and El Salvador. After his parents divorced, he was educated at Ampleforth College alongside Edward Stourton where they won the Observer Mace debating prize. He then studied law at the University of Bristol. Career With pupillage at Middle Temple, he was called to the bar in 1980, and initially undertook County Court domestic violence cases. He took silk in 1997. In 2000/1 he was on the losing side of the husband farmer in the White v White case, where the judge ruled that \\"there should be no bias in favour of the money-earner and against the home-maker and the child-carer.\\" After this his career took off, and after winning a number of notable cases including representing the wife of footballer Ray Parlour, and winning the 1,000 day marriage case for the wife of a leading City of London fund manager where no children where involved, he earned himself the nickname of \\"Mr Payout.\\" At the height of his earnings, he is said to have received ¬£500 an hour. He was retained by Fiona Shackleton in Paul McCartney's divorce case with Heather Mills. Mostyn would also undertake pro bono cases where he thought there was an important issue of law involved, particularly issues arising from the functions of the Child Support Agency: Mostyn became an assistant recorder in 1997, and both a recorder and a deputy High Court judge (in the Family Division) in 2000. Mostyn was appointed a full-time High Court judge on 20 April 2010, on the retirement of Mr Justice Bennett. He was knighted on 11 May 2010. In 2015, Mostyn was removed from the second case that year, after he went against a landmark ruling of the Supreme Court concerning the rights of disabled people (namely that they have the same right to ‚Äúphysical liberty‚Äù as non-disabled people). Notable cases *Karen v. Ray Parlour: won more than ¬£4m in 2004 in a divorce against the settlement former Arsenal F.C. footballer, where it was ruled that Karen's efforts to curb Parlour's addiction to the 'laddish' footballer drinking culture meant she had played an important role in his career. She was awarded a ¬£250,000 lump sum, an annual personal maintenance allowance of ¬£406,500, two tax-free homes, ¬£37,000 maintenance for their three children, and 37.5% of his future earnings. *Miller v Miller: City of London fund manager Alan, who was married to Melissa for less than 1000 days, was ordered to pay her ¬£5m of his reported ¬£65m fortune. No children were involved. *Sandra v. Sir Martin Sorrell: won the ex-wife of the CEO of advertising group WPP, a 40:60 share of marital in 2005, a sum of ¬£29m after being \\"marginalised and dehumanised\\" by her husband during their 32-year marriage. The payout included a ¬£23.4m lump sum, ¬£2m in bank deposits, the family's ¬£3.25m home, and two parking spaces valued at ¬£200,000. *Shan v. Harry Lambert: in 2001, won ¬£7.5M for the ex-wife of the newspaper proprietor. Harry Lambert who was represented by Martin Pointer QC. In 2002 after an appeal by Harry, the figure was increased by ¬£2.6m, half Lambert's ¬£20m fortune. Lambert described his ex-wife's contribution to their 23-year marriage as \\"revolving around children and the microwave,\\" the judge quoted White v White back to him. *Zeta v. Francois Graff: won the model, socialite and actress ¬£10m on divorcing diamond heir Francois in 2003. The settlement included a London property and a jewellery collection, from a family worth more than ¬£100m. Mostyn described the settlement as a \\"crushing victory.\\" * Sir Paul McCartney v. Heather Mills: in which Mostyn was retained by McCartney's solicitor Fiona Shackleton,Reality bites for the McCartneys ‚Äì Scotsman.com before Mills' solicitor Anthony Julius, leading to them being known during the case by the media as the \\"legal dream team.\\" *Charles Spencer, 9th Earl Spencer v. second wife, Carolyn Freud: Mostyn represented the Earl. After losing the right to have the case heard in a closed court session, the Earl was upset at the final settlement. Mostyn, a keen farmer, named his latest batch of seven pigs after his thoughts on the case's high court judge, Mr Justice James Munby: James, Munby, Self-regarding, Pompous, Publicity, Seeking, Pillock. The Earl later unsuccessfully sued Mostyn. *Katrin Radmacher v Nicolas Granatino:Mostyn represented Nicolas Granatino against millionairess, Katrin Radmacher. Mrs Radmacher was represented by Richard Todd QC. Mrs Radmacher was successful in effecting a change in the common law so that pre-nups were no longer void for public policy reasons. * Re AA: Mostyn presided as judge and authorised an NHS Trust to deliver a deliver a child by emergency caesarian section, as the mother was judged to have lacked capacity to have consented to the operation herself. The mother was an Italian citizen who was visiting the UK; during her visit she suffered a severe psychological episode. The child was later the subject of a care application by Essex County Council. * RF v Secretary of State for Work And Pensions [2017] EWHC 3375 (Admin) (21 December 2017): Mostyn ruled that the DWP had been engaging in practices that were \\"blatantly discriminatory against those with mental health impairments and which cannot be objectively justified. The wish to save nearly ¬£1 billion a year at the expense of those with mental health impairments is not a reasonable foundation for passing this measure.\\" Ministers had earlier rewritten the law in order to be able to ignore the outcome of a tribunal that resulted in similar conclusions.

Overview Logico-linguistic modeling is a six-stage method developed primarily for building knowledge-based systems (KBS), but it also has application in manual decision support systems and information source analysis. Logico-linguistic models have a superficial similarity to John F. Sowa's conceptual graphs;Sowa, John F. (1984), Conceptual Structures: Information Processing in Mind and Machine, Addison-Wesley, Reading, MA, USA. both use bubble style diagrams, both are concerned with concepts, both can be expressed in logic and both can be used in artificial intelligence. However, logico-linguistic models are very different in both logical form and in their method of construction. Logico-linguistic modeling was developed in order to solve theoretical problems found in the soft systems method for information system design. The main thrust of the research into has been to show how soft systems methodology (SSM), a method of systems analysis, can be extended into artificial intelligence.  Background  SSM employs three modeling devices i.e. rich pictures, root definitions, and conceptual models of human activity systems. The root definitions and conceptual models are built by stakeholders themselves in an iterative debate organized by a facilitator. The strengths of this method lie, firstly, in its flexibility, the fact that it can address any problem situation, and, secondly, in the fact that the solution belongs to the people in the organization and is not imposed by an outside analyst.Gregory, Frank Hutson and Lau, Sui Pong (1999) Logical Soft Systems Modelling for Information Source Analysis - The Case of Hong Kong Telecom, Journal of the Operational Research Society, vol. 50 (2). Information requirements analysis (IRA) took the basic SSM method a stage further and showed how the conceptual models could be developed into a detailed information system design.Wilson, Brian Systems: Concepts, Methodologies and Applications, John Wiley & Sons Ltd. 1984, 1990. IRA calls for the addition of two modeling devices: \\"Information Categories\\", which show the required information inputs and outputs from the activities identified in an expanded conceptual model; and the \\"Maltese Cross\\", a matrix which shows the inputs and outputs from the information categories and shows where new information processing procedures are required. A completed Maltese Cross is sufficient for the detailed design of a transaction processing system. The initial impetus to the development of logico-linguistic modeling was a concern with the theoretical problem of how an information system can have a connection to the physical world.Gregory, Frank Hutson (1995) Mapping Information Systems onto the Real World. Working Paper Series No. WP95/01. Dept. of Information Systems, City University of Hong Kong. This is a problem in both IRA and more established methods (such as SSADM) because none base their information system design on models of the physical world. IRA designs are based on a notional conceptual model and SSADM is based on models of the movement of documents. The solution to these problems provided a formula that was not limited to the design of transaction processing systems but could be used for the design of KBS with learning capability.Gregory, Frank Hutson (1993) SSM for Knowledge Elicitation & Representation, Warwick Business School Research Paper No. 98. Later published in the Journal of the Operational Research Society (1995) 46, 562-578.  The six stages of logico-linguistic modeling Fig 1. SSM Conceptual Model The logico-linguistic modeling method comprises six stages.  1. Systems analysis  In the first stage logico-linguistic modeling uses SSM for systems analysis. This stage seeks to structure the problem in the client organization by identifying stakeholders, modelling organizational objectives and discussing possible solutions. At this stage it not assumed that a KBS will be a solution and logico-linguistic modeling often produces solutions that do not require a computerized KBS. Expert systems tend to capture the expertise, of individuals in different organizations, on the same topic. By contrast a KBS, produced by logico-linguistic modeling, seeks to capture the expertise of individuals in the same organization on different topics. The emphasis is on the elicitation of organizational or group knowledge rather than individual experts. In logico-linguistic modeling the stakeholders become the experts. The end point of this stage is an SSM style conceptual models such as figure 1.  2. Language creation  Fig 2. Logico-linguistic Model According to the theory behind logico-linguistic modeling the SSM conceptual model building process is a Wittgensteinian language-game in which the stakeholders build a language to describe the problem situation.Gregory, Frank Hutson (1992) SSM to Information Systems: A Wittengsteinian Approach. Warwick Business School Research Paper No. 65. With revisions and additions this paper was published in Journal of Information Systems (1993) 3, pp. 149‚Äì168. The logico-linguistic model expresses this language as a set of definitions, see figure 2.  3. Knowledge elicitation After the model of the language has been built putative knowledge about the real world can be added by the stakeholders. Traditional SSM conceptual models contain only one logical connective (a necessary condition). In order to represent causal sequences, \\"sufficient conditions\\" and \\"necessary and sufficient conditions\\" are also required.Gregory, Frank Hutson (1992) Cause, Effect, Efficiency & Soft Systems Models. Warwick Business School Research Paper No. 42. Later published in Journal of the Operational Research Society (1993) 44 (4), pp 149-168 In logico-linguistic modeling this deficiency is remedied by two addition types of connective. The outcome of stage three is an empirical model, see figure 3.  4. Knowledge representation  Fig 3. Empirical Model Modal predicate logic (a combination of modal logic and predicate logic) is used as the formal method of knowledge representation. The connectives from the language model are logically true (indicated by the \\"L\\" modal operator) and connective added at the knowledge elicitation stage are possibility true (indicated by the \\"M\\" modal operator). Before proceeding to stage 5, the models are expressed in logical formulae.  5. Computer code  Formulae in predicate logic translate easily into the Prolog artificial intelligence language. The modality is expressed by two different types of Prolog rules. Rules taken from the language creation stage of model building process are treated as incorrigible. While rules from the knowledge elicitation stage are marked as hypothetical rules. The system is not confined to decision support but has a built in learning capability.  6. Verification  A knowledge based system built using this method verifies itself. Verification takes place when the KBS is used by the clients. It is an ongoing process that continues throughout the life of the system. If the stakeholder beliefs about the real world are mistaken this will be brought out by the addition of Prolog facts that conflict with the hypothetical rules. It operates in accordance to the classic principle of falsifiability found in the philosophy of scienceGregory, Frank Hutson (1996) \\"The need for \\"Scientific\\" Information Systems\\" Proceedings of the Americas Conference on Information Systems, Aug 1996, Association for Information Systems, 1996. pp. 534-536.  Applications   Knowledge-based computer systems  Logico-linguistic modeling has been used to produce fully operational computerized knowledge based systems, such as one for the management of diabetes patients in a hospital out-patients department.Choi, Mei Yee Sarah (1997) Logico-linguistic Modelling for building a Diabetes Mellitus Patient Management Knowledge Based System.

Manual decision support  In other projects the need to move into Prolog was considered unnecessary because the printed logico-linguistic models provided an easy to use guide to decision making. For example, a system for mortgage loan approvalLee, Kam Shing Clive (1997) The Development of a Knowledge Based System on Mortgage Loan Approval. M.A. Dissertation, Department of Information Systems, City University of Hong Kong.  Information source analysis  In some cases a KBS could not be built because the organization did not have all the knowledge needed to support all their activities. In these cases logico- linguistic modeling showed shortcomings in the supply of information and where more was needed. For example, a planning department in a telecoms company  Criticism  While logico-linguistic modeling overcomes the problems found in SSM's transition from conceptual model to computer code, it does so at the expense of increased stakeholder constructed model complexity. The benefits of this complexity are questionableKlein, J. H. (1994) Cognitive processes and operational research: a human information processing perspective. Journal of the Operational Research Society. Vol. 45, No. 8. and this modeling method may be much harder to use than other methods.Klein, J. H. (1995) Over-simplistic cognitive science: A response. Journal of the Operational Research Society. Vol. 46, No. 4. pp. 275-6. This contention has been exemplified by subsequent research. An attempt by researchers to model buying decisions across twelve companies using logico-linguistic modeling required simplification of the models and removal of the modal elements.Nakswasdi, Suravut (2004) Logical Soft Systems for Modeling Industrial Machinery Buying Decisions in Thailand.

Dick, first published in the July 1953 edition of Fantastic Story Magazine, and later in The Collected Stories of Philip K. Dick. It has since been republished several times, including in Beyond Lies the Wub in 1988. The story centers around two college professors, Hardy and Grote, who argue about one of Zeno's Paradoxes, called The dichotomy paradox, where a frog wants to get up from a well, but each jump is half of the previous one. That way, Hardy argues, the frog will never exit the well, while Grote argues the opposite: that the frog will eventually escape from the well. The Dean of the college wants to settle this age-old paradox and instructs the two professors to create an experiment with the frog. Hardy and Grote do exactly that: they send the frog down a large tube and subject it to an energy field which reduces the size of the frog in half for each leap. The frog eventually becomes so small that it disappears. Grote goes into the tube to figure out what happened, while Hardy flicks on the switch, forcing Grote down the tube. Grote is halved in size as he progresses, and the smooth floor of the tube eventually becomes huge rocks and boulders as he nears microscopic size. Grote disappears, and Hardy claims that the frog never made it across and that he was right. In the end, Grote -- and the frog -- became so small that they passed through the molecules of the tube, away from the field and back to their original size.

It was made shortly after the production of another film about the French Foreign Legion, Outpost in Morocco. Burt Lancaster was sought for a supporting part. In March 1948 it was announced Universal signed Dick Powell to play the lead. Edmond O'Brien dropped out of the film to make a movie with Deanna Durbin.

The name Carysbrook came from the colonial era plantation named for the Cary family. The Cary Plantation sprawled over thousands of acres along the banks of the Rivanna River, encompassing fertile bottomland where tobacco and other crops were grown. Wilson Miles Cary moved his family to his Fluvanna plantation, Carysbrook, in 1777 because the British were too close to his Williamsburg home. This newcomer, with ties of kinship to the Jefferson family, set himself up as a leader of the new county of Fluvanna. The Cary family's numerous slaves cultivated the land and tended to the rambling plantation home. The Virginia Air Line Railway ran through Carysbrook. A small group of buildings and businesses associated with the railroad grew up around where the railroad crossed U.S. 15. A U.S. Post Office was established at Carysbrook. The train traveled from Strathmore Yard on the James River, to Cohasset, Carysbrook, Palmyra, Troy and on to Gordonsville or Charlottesville. There was a stone quarry near Carysbrook that quarried the granite for the railroad's bridges. The railroad bridge over the Rivanna River remains standing today to the north of Carysbrook, but is privately owned. The railroad was completed and began operating in October 1908. This branch route was built to handle cargo that would have otherwise been too tall or wide to fit through the tunnels that crossed the Blue Ridge Mountains between Charlottesville and Waynesboro. Coal destined for Washington, D.C. and Northern Virginia was sent down the James River Line to the southern junction of the route at Strathmore Yard, near Bremo Bluff. The shipments then proceeded up the Virginia Air Line to the northern junction at Lindsay, and continued on to Gordonsville. The railway also became an important line of communication that connected the small communities along the route with larger cities, such as Washington, D.C. C&O; began to operate the company directly in July 1909, and acquired it outright in July 1912. In 1927, dedicated passenger rail service was reduced to one train per day in each direction, and replaced by mixed (passenger and freight) trains in June 1932. Mixed trains stopped running in 1954. The growing adoption of automobiles, trucks and airplanes had been taking business away from railroads since the 1930s. On October 26, 1971, the Fluvanna Board of Supervisors unsuccessfully sued the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad to keep the railway in operation; it was abandoned in November 1975. At one point there were a few small businesses surrounding the railroad tracks in Carysbrook to include a station, grocery store and post office. A few manufacturing plants opened in Carysbrook in the 1960s and 1970s but have since ceased operations. The original Fluvanna County High School was built at Carysbrook and completed in 1934. The high school moved next to Fluvanna Junior High School (former Abrams High School) in 1976. Today the former F.C.H.S. campus and playing fields are used by the county parks & rec and other community organizations. Carysbrook Elementary School (formerly Fluvanna Middle School) is located on U.S. Route 15 across the old railroad tracks from the old F.C.H.S. football/baseball stadium.

It became a community because of the Virginia Air Line Railway, with the train station being known as the Fork Union Depot. The station served the community of Cohasset itself which grew up around the depot soon after it was built - a general store and post office, four houses, a very early gas station, all of which still stand. Mrs. Lettie Dickey, who with her husband sold the land for the station to the railroad, had named the community Cohasset for her hometown in Massachusetts. The train traveled from Strathmore Yard on the James River to Cohasset, Carysbrook, Palmyra, Troy and to Gordonsville or Charlotttesville.

The shipments then proceeded up the Virginia Air Line to the northern junction at Lindsay, and continued on to Gordonsville. The Fork Union Depot served as a typical small railroad station of its day. Much of the local commercial business was associated with the nearby sawmill, canning factory, and two small oil storage companies.

It is a Protestant Church and is under the auspices of Methodist Church in India. It was built in the 1970s in order to accommodate the increasing number of Methodists in the city. It is currently the largest church in Hyderabad in terms of seating capacity. The church shares its premises with its predecessor the Methodist chapel which was built in 1817. This church which is popularly known as the Methodist Chapel of Chapel Road was established by the missionaries of the Methodist Episcopal Church. The church offers services in Telugu, English, Hindi, Marathi and Kannada. History The Methodists began their missionary activities in the Deccan region of India in the mid-1800s. The South India Conference of the Methodists was also held in Hyderabad in 1884. The Methodist chapel was built much earlier, in 1877, and has the distinction of being the oldest Christian religious structure in the city. Due to its small size, it was never referred to as a church; it is still referred to as a chapel. The much larger Centenary Methodist church was built in the 1970s in order to accommodate the growing number of Methodists in the city. The church now caters to a cosmopolitan group of Methodists, who speak Telugu (the largest) followed by English, Hindi, Marathi, and Kannada. Architecture Methodist Chapel The Methodist chapel is a small whitewashed Neo-Gothic Structure. The chapel features a multitude of spires and Gothic buttresses. The walls of the chapel also feature several plaques commemorating the services of several missionaries that worked in the region. The church also has a large stained glass window as its altarpiece. Centenary Methodist Church This is a much larger roomier church that can accommodate more than 2000 people. The church is a stone masonry structure subscribing to the contemporary style of architecture. It has a wide and lofty nave with a balcony.

Life and career Born Henry Aglionby Bateman, he was the son of Rev. Samuel Bateman and Anne Aglionby. Anne became one of the co-heirs of the Aglionby family when her brother Christopher died without issue in 1785; Henry adopted the name of Aglionby in 1798 by the will of his aunt Julia Aglionby. Aglionby was educated at St John's College, Cambridge, where he graduated with a BA in 1813 and a MA in 1816. Called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn in June 1816, he became a special pleader on the Northern Circuit. He was elected at the 1832 general election for the borough of Cockermouth in Cumberland, and held the seat until his death in 1854, aged 64. Like many others in western Cumberland, he was a strong supporter of the secret ballot, prompted part by the systematic bribery and intimidation which was used in 1832 to secure the election of the Tory MP Matthias Attwood in Whitehaven. In April 1833 Aglionby voted in favour of a motion proposed by City of London MP George Grote \\"That all elections of Members to serve in Parliament should in future be by ballot\\". The motion was defeated by 211 votes to 106. Personal life In 1840, he inherited the rest of the Aglionby estates, including Nunnery, Cumberland, upon the death of his first cousin Francis Aglionby (formerly Yates). He married a Mrs. Sadd on 2 March 1852, at his manor of Caterham, Surrey; they had no children. By entail, the Aglionby estates passed to Charles Yates, of Virginia, the nephew of Francis Aglionby.

Foster Barham Zincke Zincke was born on 5 January 1817 at Eardley, a sugar estate in Jamaica. He was the third son of Frederick Burt Zincke, of Jamaica, by his wife, Miss Lawrence, a descendant of Henry Lawrence, president of Oliver Cromwell's council. He was fourth in descent from Christian Friedrich Zincke, the miniature and enamel painter. He entered Bedford School in 1828 and matriculated from Wadham College, Oxford, on 5 March 1835, graduating B.A. on 18 May 1839. He rowed in the Oxford boat at Henley in the same year. In 1840 he was ordained by Charles Richard Sumner, bishop of Winchester, to the curacy of Andover, and in 1841 he became curate of Wherstead and Freston, near Ipswich. In 1847, on the death of the vicar, George Capper, he was appointed vicar of Wherstead on the presentation of the crown. Soon afterwards he began to contribute to Fraser's Magazine and the Quarterly Review, and in 1852 published Some Thoughts about the School of the Future (London, 8vo), in which he criticised with some severity the system of education pursued in the universities and public schools. Shortly afterwards he was appointed one of the queen's chaplains. Zincke was a lover of travel. Immediately after leaving Oxford he visited France, and traversed a large part of Switzerland on foot. In September 1853 he went to Ireland, and convinced himself that the distressed state of the country was largely owing to past misrule. He spent the greater part of 1867 and 1868 in the United States of America, travelled eight thousand miles, and recorded his impressions and observations in Last Winter in the United States, being Table Talk collected during a Tour through the late Southern Confederation (London, 1868, 8vo). In 1871 he visited Egypt, and published The Egypt of the Pharaohs and of the Khedive (London, 8vo), which reached a second edition in 1873. On 30 May 1865 Zincke was married at St Mary's, Bryanston Square, London, to Caroline Octavia, lady Stevenson, daughter of Joseph Seymour Biscoe, and widow of Sir William Stevenson, K.C.B., governor of Mauritius. When in 1885 his stepson, Mr. Francis Seymour Stevenson, became liberal candidate for the Eye division of Suffolk (for which he sat till 1906), Zincke, who took a keen interest in politics, assisted in his victory. From that time until his death he continued to take an active part in local politics, and wrote a large number of pamphlets and addresses in support of his opinions, which were those of an advanced radical. He died at Wherstead on 23 August 1893, and was buried in the churchyard on 26 August. He left no children. Besides the works already mentioned Zincke was author of: * The Duty and Discipline of Extempore Preaching, London, 1866, 8vo; 2nd ed. 1866; American edition, New York, 1867, 8vo. * A Month in Switzerland, London, 1873, 8vo. * The Swiss Allmends ‚Ä¶ being a second Month in Switzerland, London, 1874, 8vo. * A Walk in the Grisons, being a third Month in Switzerland, London, 1875, 8vo. * The Plough and the Dollar, or the Englishry of a Century hence, London, 1883, 8vo. * Materials for the History of Wherstead, Ipswich, 1887, 8vo; 2nd enlarged edit.

Headquartered in Hilversum, GIP has regional centers in Tbilisi, Sofia, and Vilnius, and a country office in Dushanbe. GIP is a main contributor to improving psychiatric care in countries of the former Soviet Union as well as Central and Eastern Europe.; It has expanded its focus and as of 2010 is including projects in Asia, Africa, and the Caribbean. GIP also focuses on the political abuse of psychiatry throughout the world; and human rights monitoring.  History  20 December 1980 saw the formation in Paris of the International Association on the Political Use of Psychiatry (IAPUP) whose first secretary was Dr G√©rard Bles of France. Since the Congress in Honolulu in 1978, he has inspired the movement against the use of psychiatry for political ends. The organization campaigned against the political abuse of psychiatry in the Soviet Union by leading efforts within national and international psychiatric organizations to eradicate this systematic abuse. The IAPUP had no connection with any political group nor with antipsychiatry. The organization brought together and coordinated independent groups dedicated to the struggle against political abuse of psychiatry and composed of psychiatrists and human rights activists from Canada, France, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and West Germany. During its first two decades IAPUP, investigated the accusations of oppressive exploitation in a number of countries such as Argentina, Bulgaria, Chile, Czechoslovakia, Cuba, Eastern Germany, Hungary, Romania, South Africa, the Netherlands, and Yugoslavia. The publication of the IAPUP was Information Bulletin. The IAPUP included the following participating committees: # Working Group on the Internment of Dissenters in Mental Hospitals; # Committee of French Psychiatrists Against the Use of Psychiatry for Political Purposes; # German Association Against the Political Abuse of Psychiatry; # International Podrabinek Fund; # Swiss Association Against Psychiatric Abuse for Political Purposes. In 1986, Robert van Voren became General Secretary of the IAPUP. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the financing of the IAPUP headed by Robert van Voren ceased until it adopted program of broad compromises and, correspondingly, the opposite name of The International Association for the Abolition and Prevention of Political Psychiatry, or Geneva Initiative on Psychiatry. In 2005, the organization was renamed Global Initiative on Psychiatry (GIP).; From 1995 to 2000, Chair of the Geneva Initiative on Psychiatry was James Birley.  Leadership  The board is composed of professionals from some twenty countries. Chief Executive of the Global Initiative on Psychiatry is Robert van Voren,; a Honorary Fellow of the British Royal College of Psychiatrists and Honorary Member of the Ukrainian Psychiatric Association. In 2005, he was knighted by Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands for his work as a human rights activist. He is a professor of Soviet and post-Soviet Studies in the Ilia State University in Tbilisi (Georgia) and in the Vytautas Magnus University in Kaunas (Lithuania).;  Approach  The Global Initiative on Psychiatry uses a local approach to helping the mentally ill in underprivileged countries around the world. In Robert van Voren's words, their idea is that \\"mental health services should be locally empowered, locally adapted, community based, user oriented, and focused on keeping people with mental illness in society, instead of taking them out.\\" The organization has been involved in deinstitutionalizing mental health services for children in post-Communist countries. The GIP dedicates itself to promoting the necessary reforms to implement \\"humane, ethical, and effective mental health care throughout the world.\\" Reports by the Global Initiative on Psychiatry are often comprehensive and consider the treatment options. The organization has campaigned with substantial success against poor mental health practices abroad, especially in China and the former communist states. Robert van Voren's contribution to reform of forensic psychiatry in states of the former Soviet Union is widely recognized.

He was rewarded by an annuity of 10l., soon afterwards increased to 20l. and 30l., by grants of lands in several counties, viz. the manors of Bargham, Wiggenholt, and Greatham in Sussex, Saxlingham in Norfolk, and Wellington in Shropshire, and by the wardship of the son and heir of Henry Kebill, a London Alderman. He was bailiff of the lordship of Stockton Socon, Suffolk, and keeper of the New Park, near Nottingham Castle. In 1513 he took part in the campaign in France, when the king, on the day (25 September) of his victorious entry into Tournai, knighted him in the cathedral after mass. He afterwards resided at Greenwich, probably near the palace, and served on the commission of the peace in Kent from 1514 to 1521. In 1514 he was sent with the embassy to Louis XII just before his marriage with the Princess Mary of England. In the following year he went north with a present of dress from Henry VIII to his other sister the queen of Scotland. In 1520 he was at Calais preparing lodgings for the court at the Field of the Cloth of Gold. In 1522 his signature is regularly appended to the letters from the deputy and council of Calais, though his office, if he held one, must have been insignificant. In 1526 he was appointed chief porter of Calais, a post of which he had already held the reversion for some ten years, and the remainder of his life was spent in the discharge of his duties as porter, and as commissioner of sewers for the marshes of Calais, which included supervision of the sea-banks. One of his duties, not mentioned in his patent, was to keep the king supplied with artichokes, fresh vegetables and fruit being a scarce luxury in England at that time. He died in October 1534, and was succeeded by Sir Thomas Palmer of Newnhambridge, who describes his predecessor as 'an honest man, and no beggar as I am. Sir, thanks be to the king's highness, he had cause, for the king gave him a widow with four hundred marks land, and l,000l. In her purse, and she had five hundred marks in plate; and also the ward of a merchant's son of London, where he had for the said ward 800l. sterling paid on a day, and besides, the kind's highness gave him 30l. land to him and his heirs.' For coat armour he bore argent, a chevron azure between three escallops sable, and for crest, a cubit arm grasping a scimitar embossed, all proper, hilt and pommel or. There are several specimens of his handwriting among the State Papers of the period. His widow, whose name was Joan, survived him some time, but it does not appear that he left any heirs.

Average annual number of DF cases and DHF cases reported to WHO As of 2010 dengue fever is believed to infect 50 to 100 million people worldwide a year with 1/2 million life-threatening infections. It dramatically increased in frequency between 1960 and 2010, by 30 fold.WHO 2009 pg.3 This increase is believed to be due to a combination of urbanization, population growth, increased international travel, and global warming. The geographical distribution is around the equator with 70% of the total 2.5 billion people living in endemic areas from Asia and the Pacific. Many of the infected people during outbreaks are not virally tested, therefore their infections may also be due to chikungunya, a coinfection of both, or even other similar viruses.  Recent outbreaks  The first recognized dengue epidemics occurred almost simultaneously in Asia, Africa, and North America in the 1780s, shortly after the identification and naming of the disease in 1779. A pandemic began in Southeast Asia in the 1950s, and by 1975 DHF had become a leading cause of death among children in the region. The first case of DHF was reported in Manila around 1953 through 1954. A small child with dengue fever started to bleed uncontrollably. Other children then became victims to the new symptom. Epidemic dengue has become more common since the 1980s. By the late 1990s, dengue was the most important mosquito-borne disease affecting humans after malaria, with around 40 million cases of dengue fever and several hundred thousand cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever each year. Significant outbreaks of dengue fever tend to occur every five or six months. The cyclical rise and fall in numbers of dengue cases is thought to be the result of seasonal cycles interacting with a short-lived cross-immunity for all four strains in people who have had dengue. When the cross-immunity wears off the population is more susceptible to transmission whenever the next seasonal peak occurs. Thus over time there remain large numbers of susceptible people in affected populations despite previous outbreaks due to the four different serotypes of dengue virus and the presence of unexposed individuals from childbirth or immigration. There is significant evidence, originally suggested by S.B. Halstead in the 1970s, that dengue hemorrhagic fever is more likely to occur in people who have secondary infections by another one of dengue fever's four serotypes. One model to explain this process is known as antibody- dependent enhancement (ADE), which allows for increased uptake and virion replication during a secondary infection with a different strain. Through an immunological phenomenon, known as original antigenic sin, the immune system is not able to adequately respond to the stronger infection, and the secondary infection becomes far more serious. Reported cases of dengue are an under- representation of all cases when accounting for subclinical cases and cases where the patient did receive medical treatment. There was a serious outbreak in Rio de Janeiro during the summer of 2002 with 288,245 reported cases. On March 20, 2008, the secretary of health of the state of Rio de Janeiro, S√©rgio C√¥rtes, announced that 23,555 cases of dengue, including 30 deaths, had been recorded in the state in less than three months. C√¥rtes said, \\"I am treating this as an epidemic because the number of cases is extremely high.\\" Federal Minister of Health, Jos√© Gomes Tempor√£o also announced that he was forming a panel to respond to the situation. Cesar Maia, mayor of the city of Rio de Janeiro, denied that there was serious cause for concern, saying that the incidence of cases was in fact declining from a peak at the beginning of February. By April 3, 2008, the number of cases reported rose to 55,000 In Singapore, the worst dengue outbreak is currently occurring. By 2 October 2020, there were more than 30,000 confirmed cases, and at least 20 deaths. This figure has exceeded the figures of Singapore's previously worst dengue fever outbreak. Dengue fever occurs widely in the tropics, including the Southern United States, northern Argentina, northern Australia, Bangladesh, Barbados, Bolivia, Belize, Brazil, Cambodia, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominican Republic, French Polynesia, Guadeloupe, El Salvador, Grenada, Guatemala, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, India, Indonesia, Jamaica, Laos, Malaysia, Melanesia, Mexico, Micronesia, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Panama, Paraguay,Reuters, \\"Dengue Fever Hits Paraguay\\", New York Times\\" (March 4, 2007) The Philippines, Puerto Rico, Samoa, Western Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Suriname, Taiwan, Thailand, Trinidad and Tobago, Venezuela and Vietnam, and increasingly in southern China. A 2010 outbreak in Puerto Rico resulted in 5382 confirmed infections and 20 deaths. Nearby Guadeloupe and Martinique, in the French Caribbean, were affected as well: over 40000 clinical cases in each island required medical assistance (the outbreak peaked in August 2010 and was practically over by October). . A considerable number of cases were recorded in the French/Dutch island of St.Martin/Sint Marteen as well, where dengue is endemic. There was an outbreak in Pakistan with more than 5000 confirmed infections and a mortality rate of 31. The 2010 and 2009 dengue outbreaks in Key West Florida are similar to the 2005 Texas (25 cases) and 2001 Hawaii (122 cases) outbreaks, which were locally sustained on American soil and not a result of travelers returning from endemic areas. American visitors to and visitors from dengue-endemic regions will continue to present a potential pathway for the dengue virus to enter the United States and infect populations that have not been exposed to the virus for several decades. The health risks and rapidly escalating costs to the United States of unmonitored, unvaccinated and disease carrying travelers, legal and illegal, has been recently considered. An outbreak of dengue fever was declared in Cairns, located in the tropical north of Queensland, Australia on 1 December 2008. As of 3 March 2009 there were 503 confirmed cases of dengue fever, in a residential population of 152,137. Outbreaks were subsequently declared the neighbouring cities and towns of Townsville (outbreak declared 5 January 2009), Port Douglas (6 February 2009), Yarrabah (19 February 2009), Injinoo (24 February 2009), Innisfail (27 February 2009) and Rockhampton (10 March 2009). There have been occurrences of dengue types one, two, three, and four in the region. On March 4, 2009, Queensland Health had confirmed an elderly woman had died from dengue fever in Cairns, in the first fatality since the epidemic began last year. The statement said that although the woman had other health problems, she tested positive for dengue and the disease probably contributed to her death. An epidemic broke out in Bolivia in early 2009, in which 18 people died and 31,000 were infected. In 2009, in Argentina, a dengue outbreak was declared the northern provinces of Chaco, Catamarca, Salta, Jujuy, and Corrientes, with over 9673 cases reported as of April 11, 2009 by the Health Ministry. Some travelers from the affected zones have spread the fever as far south as Buenos Aires. Major efforts to control the epidemic in Argentina are focused on preventing its vector (the Aedes mosquitoes) from reproducing. This is addressed by asking people to dry out all possible water reservoirs from where mosquitoes could proliferate (which is, in other countries, known as \\"descacharrado\\"). There were information campaigns concerning prevention of the dengue fever; and the government is fumigating with insecticide in order to control the mosquito population. One of the South Asian countries still suffering highly from this problem is Sri Lanka.Sri Lanka An outbreak caused by serotype DENV-1 occurred in 2002 on Easter Island. Subsequent outbreaks occurred in 2006‚Äì2007 and 2008, 2009 and 2011 with decreasing magnitude over time. The male:female ratio in reported cases was approximately 1:1 and the average age at infection was 31.38 ¬± 18.37 in both sexes.  2010  In many undeveloped regions, \\"authorities do not have adequate facilities to detect dengue cases.\\" Notably, in the Philippines where patients seek herbal medication in lieu of hospitals for treating dengue, death rates as evidenced below are statistically far greater than other affected areas. As many cases go unreported, higher statistics here do not necessarily indicate a larger outbreak. In 2010, Latin America alone reported a sum of 1.5 million cases. { class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" - !Country !Region !Confirmed Cases (Year: 2010) !Suspected Cases (Year: 2010) !Reported Deaths (Year: 2010) !Compared with previous year !Figures as of** - valign=top World (sum of all regions)   1,785,059  N.A.  2,398   - valign=top   ‚Äì 1,011,548  ‚Äì  656  406,269  mid Oct - valign=top   ‚Äì  121,600  ‚Äì  161  ‚Äì  Sep 24http://www.elheraldo.com.co/ELHERALDO/BancoConocimiento/0/0van_127600_casos_de_dengue/0van_127600_casos_de_dengue.asp?CodSeccion=25 - valign=top   ‚Äì  ‚Äì  N/A  N/A  155,000 and 1386 deaths  no date - valign=top   ‚Äì  119,789  ‚Äì  724  49,319 (up 140%)  Nov 17 - valign=top   ‚Äì  124,931  ‚Äì  ‚Äì  65,869  all of 2010 - valign=top   ‚Äì  108,863  ‚Äì  131  up 134.7% on sep 27  Nov 20 - valign=top   ‚Äì  ~80,000  ‚Äì  59  105,370 (whole year)  Sep - valign=top   ‚Äì  69,745  ‚Äì  81  13,351 (whole year)  December 2010 - valign=top   ‚Äì  45,037  ‚Äì  133  39,537  dec 17 - valign=top   ‚Äì  26,824  ‚Äì  192   mid Jul - valign=top   ‚Äì  21,000  ‚Äì  N/A  3,326  end Aug - valign=top   ‚Äì  14,659  ‚Äì  39  7,214(whole year)  aug 28 - valign=top   ‚Äì  13,990  ‚Äì  22  ‚Äì  Sep 18 - valign=top   ‚Äì  13,678  6138  n/a  n/a  sep 30 - valign=top   ‚Äì  12,240  ‚Äì  20  15,032  week 32 (sep) - valign=top   Bali  10,230  ‚Äì  29  N/A  Jan‚ÄìOct - valign=top   ‚Äì  8,839  ‚Äì  41  3,000  Sep 3 - valign=top   ‚Äì  6,458  15,068  1  n/a  week 28http://migenteinforma.org/el-dengue-prolifera-en-las-fronteras-de-guatemala- honduras-y-el-salvador - valign=top   Delhi  5,837  ‚Äì  8  1,153  Nov 9 - valign=top   ‚Äì  7,000+  ‚Äì  35  ‚Äì  Nov 22http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2010\\\\story_1-11-2010_pg1_5 - valign=top   North Sumatra  5,805  ‚Äì  N/A  4,643 (whole year)  Sep - valign=top   Semarang  5,284  ‚Äì  43  3,883  Oct 12 - valign=top   ‚Äì  5,103  ‚Äì  41  4,497  dec 11http://www.straitstimes.com/BreakingNews/Singapore/Story/STIStory_614132.html - valign=top   ‚Äì  3,771  ‚Äì  10  2,355  to July - valign=top   Jeddah  2219  ‚Äì  N/A   dec 16 - valign=top   Martinique  644  41970  17   Nov 22 - valign=top   Guadeloupe  418  44000  5   Nov 22 http://www.invs.sante.fr/surveillance/dengue/points_guadeloupe/2010/pep_guadeloupe_2010_28_dengue.pdf - valign=top   ‚Äì  1,925  11,800  25   1 sep - valign=top   Yogyakarta  1123  ‚Äì  ‚Äì  688 (whole year)  Sep 26 - valign=top   ‚Äì  1211  ‚Äì  2  1052  Nov 1 - valign=top   ‚Äì  1,200  ‚Äì  4  N/A  end aug - valign=top   Uttar Pradesh  496  ‚Äì  8   Oct 20 - valign=top   Chitwan 280  ‚Äì  ‚Äì  ‚Äì  Oct 17, 2010 - valign=top   ‚Äì  198 (24-2010FL, 27-2009FL, 25-2005TX, 122-2001HI) [http%3A%2F%2Fwww.abola.pt%2Fmundos%2Fver.aspx%3Fid%253D215785&tl;=en&sl;=pt]  2 (2010, suspected)  Cases down 11% from 2009  Aug 3, 2010 - valign=top   Mayotte  75  ‚Äì  N/A   Sep 1 - valign=top   Queensland  13  0  1   Nov 3, 2010 } 2011 Philippines dengue case load for Q1 2011 was some 5% higher than the preceding year, at 18,885 cases and 115 deaths.

A notable case was that of Trinidad and Tobago's first female Prime Minister, Kamla Persad- Bissessar, who was diagnosed with dengue fever in August 2011, prompting investigation into the possibility of an epidemic on the twin-island republic. In 2012 the Island of Madeira experienced its first outbreak of dengue with 1080 confirmed cases. Some 52,008 cases of dengue fever were recorded in Thailand from Jan to Oct 16, 2012, with 50 deaths. 2013 Record dengue outbreaks reported in 2013 in many countries: Brazil (double deaths over 2012), Singapore, and Thailand (worst in 20 years), among others. San Pedro Sula, Honduras declared a dengue 'state of emergency', and Central America had its worst outbreaks since 2008. Polynesia experienced an 'unprecedented' series of outbreaks (14), along with Chikungunya and Zika virus. In only 7 weeks, in Brazil some 205,000 cases of dengue were reported, a record.

Dengue appeared in the Hawaiian Islands in late 2015, with at least 190 cases confirmed by year end. Most cases were reported on the island of Hawaii (the \\"Big Island\\"). 2016 Argentina registered a Dengue fever outbreak in late January 2016 with 13 of 24 provinces affected. In Thailand, officials anticipated as many cases in 2016 as occurred during a large outbreak in 1978, the largest ever recorded.

History The first castle on the site was built in the 11th or early 12th century and was a simple timber structure.National Monuments Office website , accessed 19 December 2010. The site was chosen because it occupied a natural high point overlooking the River Severn.Steane, p.26. A later mound, 60 ft wide and 7 ft high was also constructed on the site, and it is suspected that this may have been an unfinished motte. It is possible that this was built during the period of the Anarchy in the 12th century, and one theory is that the castle was destroyed by Henry II after the conflict as part of a wider programme of castle denigration in Gloucestershire during the 1150s.Amt, p.44. The site was later used for meetings of the local Hundred of Bledisloe, and another theory for the creation of the mound is that it was specifically made to support these meetings. A manor house, Bledisloe Manor, was later built on the site, and the remaining earthworks were destroyed during the 1970s.

She wrote the screenplay for the film Forgotten Light, which was awarded three Czech Lions in 1997. Her name is associated with the golden generation of Czech filmmakers, known as Czech New Wave. She was married to the late researcher Frederick Jelinek. Biography Jelinek was born on 19 August 1935 in P≈ôe≈°tice, near Plze≈à. From 1955, she studied at the Film and TV School of the Academy of Performing Arts in Prague. The film director Ivan Passer was one of her classmates, and the writer Milan Kundera was her literature teacher. One of her early screenplays, written under her maiden name and titled Snadn√Ω ≈æivot (An Easy Life), was filmed by Milo≈° Makovec and Ji≈ô√≠ Brdeƒçka. Already during her studies, she took part in various anti-communist protests. According to her own words, the Czechoslovak president Anton√≠n Novotn√Ω in a speech against \\"unreliable writers\\" even listed her name as a \\"subversive person\\". Frederick Jelinek emigrated from Czechoslovakia to the United States in 1949, however, in 1957 he visited Vienna as a participant of a professional conference. During his stay, he decided to visit his old friends in Prague. He met and befriended Milena Tobolov√° during a meeting with the film director Milo≈° Forman in a Prague caf√©. Gradually, they became close and eventually they decided to marry. However, their application for marriage was denied on several occasions by communist authorities. In 1960, Frederick Jelinek was proclaimed \\"persona non grata\\" in Czechoslovakia and his planned visits were banned permanently. Coincidentally, the same year Tobolov√° received permission by the government to leave the country. Her son William Jelinek later claimed: \\"As an inaugural gift to Kennedy, the Czechs released nine dissidents and one of them was my mother\\". In January, 1961, she left for the US and shortly after that she married Jelinek. In the US, she gradually managed to find a place in the world of film, mainly thanks to another √©migr√©, filmmaker Franti≈°ek Daniel. She already knew him from the school in Prague, and met him again at the American Film Institute in Los Angeles. In 1980, she joined him and began teaching screenwriting at the Columbia University in New York. At the University, she spent a major part of her professional career. She is the author of the script for the play Adina, staged in 2007 in the Vinohrady Theatre, Prague. The play depicts the life story of the renowned Czech pre-War actor Adina Mandlov√°. Jelinek also wrote the libretto for the opera Kafka's Women by Czech composer Ji≈ô√≠ Kade≈ô√°bek, first staged at the Cell Theater in New York City in 2013. For the screenplay for the film Zapomenut√© svƒõtlo (Forgotten Light), she found an inspiration in a short story by the Czech Catholic priest and writer Jakub Deml. Forgotten Light received seven Czech Lion nominations, including one for Best Screenplay, however, the Czech Film and Television Academy awarded the film three Lions for Best Actor, Best Supporting Actress and Best Sound.

It is found in Europe, where it is eaten in France. Genus Elias Magnus Fries described the species in 1821 as Agaricus columbetta. Paul Kummer placed it in the genus Tricholoma in 1871, within which it is classified in the Section Albata. Description The fruit body (mushroom) is white or ivory-coloured, sometimes with a pale ochre tinge in the centre of the cap or pinkish, violet-blue or greenish spots. The cap is conical in young specimens, expanding to convex or flattish with a wavy margin, and is 4‚Äì10 cm in diameter. It can be a little sticky when wet. The centre of the cap may have a small boss or be depressed. The gills are adnate and widely spaced. The cylindrical stalk is 6-14 cm tall and 0,8-2 cm thick, and has no ring. The mushroom has a mealy smell, which is stronger when it is cut. The spore print is white. The spores are 5-7.5 x 3.5-5.5 Œºm. Tricholoma columbetta is edible, with a pleasant taste. Tricholoma albidum is similar but stains yellow when cut or bruised. T. columbetta could be confused with paler specimens of the poisonous Entoloma lividum, though the latter has a more grey-white cap, yellow or pink gills. Distribution Widespread across Europe, Tricholoma columbetta forms mycorrhizal relationships with oak (Quercus) and is found in woodlands, parks, and rarely sand dunes on sandy mildly acidic soils. Mushrooms appear from August to November. In southern Finland, mushrooms appear in August and September.

The Warsaw pact response to NATO's position was that each side should reduce its forces proportionally rather than absolutely, and that equipment as well as troop numbers should be reduced. *Each side should cut their forces by 20,000 *A subsequent 15 per cent manpower and equipment reduction in manpower by every country in NATO and the Warsaw Pact. 1976 The Warsaw Pact countries submitted a proposal that the USSR and the US should reduce manpower by 2 to 3 per cent, and that both the US and the USSR would remove the same number of nuclear warheads, 354 nuclear-capable aircraft, a number of SCUD-B and Pershing I launchers, 300 tanks and a corps headquarters. In 1976, the different estimates for the number of forces the Warsaw Pact countries were fielding in Eastern Europe became an issue that was never resolved during the period of the talks. (In 1976 the Warsaw Pact gave figures of 815,000 ground force personnel and 182,000 air force personnel, whilst NATO estimated that the Warsaw Pact had 956,000 and 224,000 personnel respectively.) 1979 In December 1979 the Soviets held up the talks because of NATO's decision to site new intermediate- range nuclear missiles in Europe. Talks end The talks ended in on 2 February 1989 and were replaced by the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe.

There is a separate list by genre. Chopin at 25, by Maria Wodzi≈Ñska, 1835 Most of Chopin's compositions were for solo piano, although he did compose two piano concertos (his concertos No. 1 and No. 2 are two of the romantic piano concerto repertoire's most often-performed pieces) as well as some other music for ensembles. His larger scale works such as sonatas, the four scherzi, the four ballades, the Fantaisie in F minor, Op. 49, and the Barcarole in F major, Op. 60 have cemented a solid place within the repertoire, as well as shorter works like his polonaises, mazurkas, waltzes, impromptus, rondos, and nocturnes taking a substantial portion of recorded and performed music. Two important collections are the √âtudes, Op. 10 and 25 (which are a staple of that genre for pianists), and the 24 Preludes, Op. 28 (a cycle of short pieces paired in a major key/relative minor key pattern following the circle of fifths in clockwise steps). In addition, he wrote numerous song settings of Polish texts, and chamber pieces including a piano trio and a cello sonata. This listing uses the traditional opus numbers where they apply; other works are identified by numbers from the catalogues of Maurice J. E. Brown (B), Krystyna Kobyla≈Ñska (KK), and J√≥zef Micha≈Ç Chomi≈Ñski (A, C, D, E, P, S). The last opus number Chopin used was 65, that allocated to the Cello Sonata in G minor. He expressed a death-bed wish that all his unpublished manuscripts be destroyed. This included the early Piano Sonata No. 1; Chopin had assigned the Opus number 4 to it in 1828, and had even dedicated it to his teacher Elsner, but chose not to publish it. In 1851, Tobias Haslinger published it as Op. 4. Then, at the request of the composer's mother and sisters, Julian Fontana selected 23 other unpublished piano pieces and grouped them into eight opus numbers (Op. 66‚Äì73). These works were published in 1855.Piano Society In 1857, the known 17 Polish songs that had been written at various stages throughout Chopin's life were collected and published as Op. 74, the order of the songs within that opus having little regard for their actual order of composition.Classical Archives Other songs have since come to light, but they are not part of Op. 74. Works that were published or have come to light since 1857 were not given opus numbers, and alternate catalogue designations are used for them.

It forms part of the greater Rosses region and is officially in the Gaeltacht, however, English is the predominantly spoken language today. Etymology The name Mullaghduff is an anglicisation of the Irish placename ‚ÄòAn Mullach Dubh‚Äô, which means 'The Black Hilltop'; which possibly derives from the blackish soil which covers the nearby hills. Music & Sport Mullaghduff is home to the world-renowned marching band Bu√≠onn Cheoil Mhullach Dubh, founded in 1881, which includes the \\"Old Band\\" and the \\"Wee Band\\". Mullaghduff is also home to Glasgow Celtic's first sod of turf, which was cut in April 1995 and placed in Celtic Park. In June 1995, a small plaque which is along the road was unveiled by Celtic Captain Paul McStay.

Career Hashimoto first appeared in the PDC circuit competing in the 2009 Las Vegas Desert Classic qualifiers, as well as a Players Championship. He attempted to qualify for the 2010 PDC World Darts Championship, but lost in the final of the Japanese Qualifying event to Haruki Muramatsu. In September 2010, Hashimoto won through the qualifier, beating Mitsumasa Hoshino in the final and qualified for the 2011 PDC World Darts Championship. A month later, he was a quarter-finalist in the Japan Open and in November, he reached the final of the WDF Asia-Pacific Cup men's singles, losing to New Zealand's Koha Kokiri. Hashimoto was drawn in the preliminary round against PDPA qualifier Matt Padgett and quickly became popular with the crowd. After winning his first leg, levelling the match at 1‚Äì1, the crowd started chanting his name to the tune of \\"Reach Up (Papa's Got a Brand New Pigbag)\\", which was used as a walk on by Adrian Lewis. Hashimoto went on to win the match by 4 legs to 2 and become the second Japanese qualifier to win through the premlinary round after Muramatsu. The song, performed by the Perfecto Allstarz, was played at the end of the match instead of the traditional \\"Chase the Sun\\" by Planet Funk, and Hashimoto would have it played as his walk on for his first round match against Gary Anderson. He would not win a leg as Anderson whitewashed him 3‚Äì0 in sets. After the match, Hashimoto, speaking English, thanked the crowd for their support. Hashimoto represented Japan with Haruki Muramatsu in the 2012 PDC World Cup of Darts and together they were beaten 5‚Äì2 by Sweden in the first round. Hashimoto beat Muramatsu 6‚Äì5 in the final of the Japanese qualifying tournament for the 2014 World Championship. He saw off Paul Lim 4‚Äì2 in the preliminary round and won the opening set in his first round match against Michael Smith, but went on to lose 3‚Äì1. In June, Hashimoto and Muramatsu watched as Canada missed seven darts for the match in the first round of the World Cup of Darts to step in and steal a 5‚Äì4 win. In the second round they both lost their singles matches against the Northern Irish partnering of Brendan Dolan and Michael Mansell to exit the tournament. A year later, after whitewashing China 5‚Äì0, they were knocked out at the same stage this time by the top seeds England. Hashimoto lost 6‚Äì2 in the first round of the inaugural Japan Darts Masters to James Wade.  Death  Hashimoto died suddenly on 13 March 2017 of a brain haemorrhage. His death was confirmed by his sponsor, Monster Barrels, on their Facebook page.https://www.facebook.com/MonsterDartsUSA/?ref=page_internal A number of darts players paid tribute to him including Gary Anderson, Hashimoto's opponent in the first round of the 2011 World Championship.

He was a member of the New South Wales Legislative Council between 1844 and 1856 and again between 1861 and 1863. He was also a member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly for three periods between 1856 and 1865. He held the positions of Solicitor General and Attorney General in a number of short-lived colonial governments. Early life Darvall was born into an upper-middle-class Yorkshire family and was educated at Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge. Subsequently, he was articled to his uncle, Sir John Bayley at the Middle Temple and was called to the English Bar in 1838. He was an awardee of a compensation claim made for 264 slaves totalling ¬£3461.https://www.ucl.ac.uk/lbs/claim/view/308 He emigrated to Sydney in 1839 and established a large, private legal practice. Darvall accrued significant agricultural and pastoral interests and was a director of several colonial companies, a number of which failed in the depression of the early 1840s. He declined a judgeship in Victoria in 1851 and was appointed as a Queen's Counsel in 1857, a CMG in 1869 and a KCMG in 1877. Darvall returned to England in 1865 and continued in legal practice. He was a great-uncle of Banjo Paterson and related through his sister Emily Mary Barton. Parliament On 24 July 1844, prior to the establishment of responsible self-government, Darvall was appointed to the New South Wales Legislative Council. He was a loyal supporter of the government until, unable to support the continuing nomination of members, he resigned in 1848. He was then elected to the Council, initially for the seat of County of Bathurst and between 1851 and 1856 as the member for County of Cumberland. Darvall styled himself as a \\"Patrician Liberal\\" and was a supporter of John Dunmore Lang and Charles Cowper. He opposed the 1853 Constitution Bill of William Charles Wentworth because of its provision for an hereditary upper house. Following the granting of self-government, Darvall was elected to the first Legislative Assembly as one of the two members for the seat of Cumberland (North Riding). He was surprisingly appointed as the Solicitor General in the conservative and short- lived government of Stuart Donaldson. He was also Solicitor General 6 June to 25 August 1856 and 3 October 1856 to 23 May 1857 then Attorney-General 26 May to 7 September 1857 in the government of Henry Parker. Darvall became concerned by the effects of manhood suffrage and the colony's liberal land distribution schemes and resigned from the Assembly in November 1857. He subsequently joined the conservative Constitutional Association and was elected in their interest for the seat of Hawkesbury at the 1859 election. His opposition to the Free Selection of Crown Lands led to significant dissension in the electorate and he did not contest the 1860 election. While opposed to parliamentary nominations, he nevertheless accepted a nomination to the Legislative Council in 1861. He used his period in the Council to press for its conversion into an elected house and for a limitation on its powers over money bills. However, at the same time, he also expressed concerns at the excesses of colonial democracy. He resigned from the Council in June 1863 to successfully contest a by-election for the seat of East Maitland and on re- entering the assembly he almost immediately accepted the position of Attorney- General in the liberal government of Charles Cowper. Cowper's government fell in October of that year and at the subsequent election he was elected as one of the four members for West Sydney. He was again made Attorney-General on 3 February 1865 by Cowper but resigned on 20 June 1865 to return to England.

By late 2001 the first beta versions of .NET 1.0 were released. The first version of .NET Framework was released on 13 February 2002, bringing managed code to Windows NT 4.0, 98, 2000, ME and XP. Since the first version, Microsoft has released nine more upgrades for .NET Framework, seven of which have been released along with a new version of Visual Studio. Two of these upgrades, .NET Framework 2.0 and 4.0, have upgraded Common Language Runtime (CLR). New versions of .NET Framework replace older versions when the CLR version is the same. The .NET Framework family also includes two versions for mobile or embedded device use. A reduced version of the framework, the .NET Compact Framework, is available on Windows CE platforms, including Windows Mobile devices such as smartphones. Additionally, the .NET Micro Framework is targeted at severely resource-constrained devices. .NET Framework 4.8 was the final version of .NET Framework, future work going into the rewritten and cross-platform .NET Core platform that is planned to ship as .NET 5 in late 2020. Overview .NET Framework 1.0 The first version of the .NET Framework was released on 13 February 2002 for Windows 98, ME, NT 4.0, 2000, and XP. Mainstream support for this version ended on 10 July 2007, and extended support ended on 14 July 2009, with the exception of Windows XP Media Center and Tablet PC editions. On 19 June 2001, the tenth anniversary of the release of Visual Basic, .NET Framework 1.0 Beta 2 was released. .NET Framework 1.0 is supported on Windows 98, ME, NT 4.0, 2000, XP, and Server 2003.

Service Pack 1  The .NET Framework 2.0 Service Pack 1 was released on 19 November 2007.Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 Service Pack 1 (x86) microsoft.com Service Pack 2  The .NET Framework 2.0 Service Pack 2 was released on 16 January 2009.Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 Service Pack 2 microsoft.com It requires Windows 2000 with SP4 plus KB835732 or KB891861 update, Windows XP with SP2 plus Windows Installer 3.1. It is the last version to support Windows 2000 although there have been some unofficial workarounds to use a subset of the functionality from Version 3.5 in Windows 2000. .NET Framework 3.0 .NET Framework 3.0, formerly called WinFX,WinFX name change announcement was released on 21 November 2006. It includes a new set of managed code APIs that are an integral part of Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008. It is also available for Windows XP SP2 and Windows Server 2003 as a download. There are no major architectural changes included with this release; .NET Framework 3.0 uses the same CLR as .NET Framework 2.0. Unlike the previous major .NET releases there was no .NET Compact Framework release made as a counterpart of this version. Version 3.0 of the .NET Framework shipped with Windows Vista. It also shipped with Windows Server 2008 as an optional component (disabled by default). .NET Framework 3.0 consists of four major new components: * Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), formerly code-named Avalon: A new user interface subsystem and API based on XAML markup language, which uses 3D computer graphics hardware and Direct3D technologies * Windows Communication Foundation (WCF), formerly code-named Indigo: A service-oriented messaging system which allows programs to interoperate locally or remotely similar to web services * Windows Workflow Foundation (WF): Allows building task automation and integrated transactions using workflows * Windows CardSpace, formerly code-named InfoCard: A software component which securely stores a person's digital identities and provides a unified interface for choosing the identity for a particular transaction, such as logging into a website .NET Framework 3.0 is supported on Windows XP, Server 2003, Vista, Server 2008, and Server 2008 R2. Applications utilizing .NET Framework 3.0 will also run on computers with .NET Framework 3.5 installed, which supports additional operating systems. Service Pack 1  The .NET Framework 3.0 Service Pack 1 was released on 19 November 2007.https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=3005 Service Pack 2  The .NET Framework 3.0 Service Pack 2 was released on 22 February 2010.https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=6962 .NET Framework 3.5 Version 3.5 of the .NET Framework was released on 19 November 2007. As with .NET Framework 3.0, version 3.5 uses Common Language Runtime (CLR) 2.0, that is, the same version as .NET Framework version 2.0. In addition, .NET Framework 3.5 also installs .NET Framework 2.0 SP1 and 3.0 SP1 (with the later 3.5 SP1 instead installing 2.0 SP2 and 3.0 SP2), which adds some methods and properties to the BCL classes in version 2.0 which are required for version 3.5 features such as Language Integrated Query (LINQ). These changes do not affect applications written for version 2.0, however. As with previous versions, a new .NET Compact Framework 3.5 was released in tandem with this update in order to provide support for additional features on Windows Mobile and Windows Embedded CE devices. The source code of the Framework Class Library in this version has been partially released (for debugging reference only) under the Microsoft Reference Source License. .NET Framework 3.5 is supported on Windows XP, Server 2003, Vista, Server 2008, 7, Server 2008 R2, 8, Server 2012, 8.1, Server 2012 R2, 10, and Server 2016. Starting from Windows 8, .NET Framework 3.5 is an optional feature that can be turned on or off in control panel. Although .NET Framework 3.5 is over 10 years old, it is also shipped as Windows Container image, allowing old applications that based on .NET Framework 2.0-3.5 to run in container environment. Service Pack 1  The .NET Framework 3.5 Service Pack 1 was released on 11 August 2008. This release adds new functionality and provides performance improvements under certain conditions, especially with WPF where 20‚Äì45% improvements are expected. Two new data service components have been added, the ADO.NET Entity Framework and ADO.NET Data Services. Two new assemblies for web development, System.WebAbstraction and System.WebRouting, have been added; these are used in the ASP.NET MVC framework and, reportedly, will be used in the future release of ASP.NET Forms applications. Service Pack 1 is included with SQL Server 2008 and Visual Studio 2008 Service Pack 1. It also featured a new set of controls called \\"Visual Basic Power Packs\\" which brought back Visual Basic controls such as \\"Line\\" and \\"Shape.\\" Version 3.5 SP1 of the .NET Framework shipped with Windows 7. It also shipped with Windows Server 2008 R2 as an optional component (disabled by default). =.NET Framework 3.5 SP1 Client Profile= For the .NET Framework 3.5 SP1 there is also a new variant of the .NET Framework, called the \\".NET Framework Client Profile\\", which at 28 MB is significantly smaller than the full framework and only installs components that are the most relevant to desktop applications. However, the Client Profile amounts to this size only if using the online installer on Windows XP SP2 when no other .NET Frameworks are installed or using Windows Update. When using the off-line installer or any other OS, the download size is still 250 MB. .NET Framework 4.0 Key focuses for this release are: * Parallel Extensions to improve support for parallel computing, which target multi-core or distributed systems. To this end, technologies like PLINQ (Parallel LINQ), a parallel implementation of the LINQ engine, and Task Parallel Library, which exposes parallel constructs via method calls, are included. * New Visual Basic .NET and C# language features, such as implicit line continuations, dynamic dispatch, named parameters, and optional parameters * Support for Code Contracts * Inclusion of new types to work with arbitrary-precision arithmetic (System.Numerics.BigInteger) and complex numbers (System.Numerics.Complex) * Introduced Common Language Runtime (CLR) 4.0 .NET Framework 4.0 is supported on Windows XP (with Service Pack 3), Windows Server 2003, Vista, Server 2008, 7 and Server 2008 R2. Applications utilizing .NET Framework 4.0 will also run on computers with .NET Framework 4.5 or 4.6 installed, which supports additional operating systems. .NET Framework 4.0 is the last version to support Windows XP and Windows Server 2003. History Microsoft announced the intention to ship .NET Framework 4 on 29 September 2008. The Public Beta was released on 20 May 2009. On 28 July 2009, a second release of the .NET Framework 4 beta was made available with experimental software transactional memory support. This functionality is not available in the final version of the framework. On 19 October 2009, Microsoft released Beta 2 of the .NET Framework 4. At the same time, Microsoft announced the expected launch date for .NET Framework 4 as 22 March 2010. This launch date was subsequently delayed to 12 April 2010. On 10 February 2010, a release candidate was published: Version:RC.http://www.infoworld.com/d/developer- world/microsoft-offers-visual-studio-2010-release-candidate-643 On 12 April 2010, the final version of .NET Framework 4.0 was launched alongside the final release of Microsoft Visual Studio 2010.

In May 2009 he became the CEO of Mimesis Republic and president of the French National Union of Video Games. He is also known for being the founder of Kalisto Entertainment, and was the head of the company between 1990 and 2002. Gaume is the son of one of the hoteliers of Arcachon, and is the great-grandson of Louis Gaume, a real estate developer known for developing the Pyla in 1920.\\"Groupe Gaume - Historique\\" Groupe Gaume, Nicolas is married with two kids. Atreid Concept In 1990, after dropping out of business school, Gaume and his friends founded his video game company, Atreid Concept, in Bordeaux. Atreid Concept was supported by Apple, whose CEO John Sculley was a former executive of the French Apple firm. Atreid Concept released a series of games for Macintosh including S.C.O.U.T. and Fury of the Furries under the brand name Kalisto. The company also produced products for videogame consoles, such as Pac-In-Time, edited by Namco and Nintendo, which granted Nicolas his first commercial success, after more than 500,000 were sold worldwide. Mindscape Bordeaux Faced with technological change - such the replacement of floppy disks by CD-ROM - and other financial restraints, Gaume sold Atreid Concept to a British group called Pearson, who had just purchased the multimedia publishing group Mindscape. Atreid Concept was renamed Mindscape Bordeaux. Under this new name, Gaume and his team developed the first game for Windows 95, a race car game, titled Al Unser Jr. Arcade Racing. They also attempted to expand the videogame into a book and a role-play game. Kalisto Entertainment In 1996, Gaume purchased the multimedia rights of Pearson, a British group, to found the company Kalisto Entertainment. Kalisto Entertainment rapidly became a commercial and technological success. The company launched many successful video game titles, such as Dark Earth and Nightmare Creatures. Edited by Sony Computer Entertainment in Japan and Europe, and by Activision in the United States, the game sold more than 1.5 million copies worldwide.Fiche Nightmare Creatures sur Jeuxvideos.com, In 1999, thanks to multiple pre-production contracts signed, the company went public on the Stock Exchange in order to raise funds for new projects. Kalisto Entertainment also developed products for the online market, as well as developing services for phone network operators. At this time, Kalisto developed ‚Äò‚ÄôThe Fifth Element‚Äô‚Äô, based on Luc Besson's movie. The game was edited by Ubisoft, and sold more than 750,000 copies worldwide. In the wake of his enormous success of 1999, and after announcing sales of 140 million Euros, Gaume was invited to accompany Jacques Chirac, President of the French Republic, on an official trip.Nicolas Gaume, PDG de Kalisto : un jeune patron tr√®s joueur Many celebrities were elected to the board of directors of Kalisto Entertainment, such as Franck Riboud, CEO of the group Danone, and Emmanuel Chain, the ex-journalist oh the TV channel M6. Dominique Strauss-Kahn, Minister of Economy, Finances and Industry, nominated him for the Economical and Social Committee. In addition, First Minister Lionel Jospin named him an Advisor of French Foreign Trade. In the beginning of 2000, during the waning days of the internet bubble, Kalisto Entertainment found itself in a dire financial situation. In 2002, after failing to gather more funding from Hedge Fund Global Emerging Markets, Kalisto Entertainment found itself in compulsory liquidation, and was forced out of the Market on 19 August 2002. As a result of the exceptional losses, regulation authorities accused the managers of grossly misinforming their stockholders.\\"Kalisto : Nicolas Gaume condamn√© par la COB\\", Les √âchos n¬∞ 18802 du 13 D√©cembre 2002 ‚Ä¢ page 18 In January 2003, 270 minority stockholders decided to sue Kalisto Entertainment in order to obtain retributory damages, and the managers of Kalisto Entertainment were discharged. In addition, a civil procedure has also ensued against the Cr√©dit Lyonnais bank. In the end, a decision was made by the Second Civil Chamber of the Appellate Court of Bordeaux on October 20, 2009, which permanently assessed the reasons of the losses of Kalisto Entertainment, and acquitted its managers of fault for the company's losses.Ordonnance de la Deuxi√®me Chambre Civile de la cour d'appel de Bordeaux, rendue le 20 Octobre 2009 sur l'affaire Kalisto Responsibilities in the world of gaming From March to November in 2003, he directed the Paris studios of Ubisoft, and from 2002 to 2005 he worked as an advisor for the British publisher Codemasters, as well as continuing to work for Ubisoft. From 2005 to 2007, Nicolas was vice president of the mobile games branch of Lagard√®re Active.\\"Linkedin - Profile - Nicolas Gaume\\" LinkedIn, Mimesis Republic In 2007, Gaume, along with Sebastian Lombardo, co-founded the company Mimesis Republic. The main focus of their new company was to develop multi-player games. Mimesis Republic began with a series of projects dealing with software performance, in particular for the site Wormee Orange, and Mission Virtual Horse, created by the publisher Mindscape. Mimesis Republic's first original project, named Black Mamba, was the basis of an ambitious virtual world called Mamba Nation, whose development began in 2008.\\"Mimesis Republic Is Zynga Meets Second Life, Comes Out Of Stealth\\" In July 2010, Mimesis Republic raised $7 million from various investors, including prestigious business executives such as Marc Simoncini, CEO and founder of the dating site Meetic, and Jean-Emile Rosenblum, founder and director of Pixmania and Francois Pinault, through his holding company Artemis SA.Greffe du tribunal de commerce de Paris, Statuts de Mimesis Republic S.A. mis √† jour le 8 juillet 2010. The social game Mamba Nation, published by Mimesis Republic in early 2012, attracted over 400,000 between the ages of 13-25 in France alone. Free accessibility via Facebook enables Mamba Nation users to create, develop, personalize and share avatars that they control, within the universe in which the game takes place. A chat function allows users talk to each other while they play. The game features a 3D interface and video, through partnership with Dailymotion. In 2011, many brands such as Puma and SFR integrated Mamba Nation as a part of their social communication tools. Mimesis Republic is now an internationally known brand name. The company is supported by funding from companies such as Kima Ventures, Artemis, Jaina Capital, and Dotcorp. Through these investors, Mimesis Republic raised over 4.5 million Euros between 2007 and 2009. Various In 1994, Gaume founded NGM Productions, under which he managed the publication of various children's books in China. NGM edited the series of P√®re Castor (Flammarion) as well as Incollables (Play Bac) from 1994 until 1999.

The genus is very diverse with currently about 400 described species and worldwide distribution.Noyes, J. S. 2003. Universal Chalcidoidea database The number of existing species is expected to be several times higher because many species are still undescribed.Heraty, J. M., et al.

A review of interagency research and implementation. Progress in Biological Control 4. Springer Science and Business Media B. V. 1-343. Encarsia is a very complex genus, with specimens showing both inter- and intra-specific variations, making morphological classification difficult. The adult wasps, tiny insects about 1 or 2 millimeters in size, are primarily parasitoids of sessile stages of Sternorrhyncha, in particular whiteflies (Aleyrodidae) and scale insects (Diaspididae). A few species are known to parasitize aphids, eggs of shield- back bugs (Plataspidae), and eggs of Lepidoptera. Females mostly develop as primary endoparasitoids, and males are commonly hyperparasitoids of the same or other species. This so-called heteronomy, a sexually dimorphic host relationship, occurs in quite a few species.Williams, T. and A. Polaszek. (1996). A re-examination of host relations in the Aphelinidae (Hymenoptera: Chalcidoidea). Biological Journal of the Linnean Society 57: 35-45. Hunter, M. S. and J. B. Woolley. (2001). Evolution and behavioral ecology of heteronomous aphelinid parasitoids. Annual Review of Entomology 46, 251-90. Species of Encarsia are of particular interest because of their economic importance for biological pest control, especially in horticulture and for crops grown under glass. Many seem to be extremely host-specific which is an important trait for an acceptable and effective bio-control agent.

The castle was originally built in the 11th century in timber, with a square keep added in stone in 1107.National Monuments Record website, accessed 19 December 2010. The castle was of primarily local significance, being relatively small.Pounds, p.52. During the Anarchy of the 12th century, the castle was seized in the early years of the conflict by Robert, Earl of Gloucester on behalf of the Empress Matilda.Clarke, p.662, Pounds, p.52. In 1142 King Stephen seized the castle in a surprise attack, setting fire to it afterwards.Clarke, p.662. Subsequent events are disputed by historians. Most 19th-century historians argued that the castle was subsequently rebuilt and held by William de la Dive, a follower of Robert, Earl of Leicester, then a supporter of the Empress. When Robert came to an agreement with Stephen at the end of the conflict, William surrendered the castle to the king. During the baronial revolt against Henry III the castle was once again garrisoned against the king; once captured by royal forces, Henry ordered it finally destroyed for good. Historian E. Fuller argued in 1890, however, that this later history was a consequence of a misreading of place names, arguing that the history of the castle concluded with its destruction in 1142.Fuller, p.118.

He made two league appearances for Hibs, but left the club after a contractual dispute. Rollo was a baker and confectioner by trade and wanted to continue that, but Hibs wanted him to become a full-time professional footballer. Rollo continued his career in England. He signed for Oldham Athletic, but his time at Boundary Park was hampered by the fierce competition with John Hardie and Johnny Bollands. Rollo was a competent goalkeeper, whose strengths were dealing with high shots and crosses. He spent the 1962‚Äì63 season mainly in the Oldham reserve team and only made 10 appearances in the promotion winning side. He then moved to Southport, Bradford City and Scarborough. After retiring as a football player, Rollo moved to Blairgowrie. An accident involving a fork lift truck meant that he had his right leg amputated in 1989. He fully recovered and worked as a scout for Liverpool, mainly covering Highland Football League matches. Rollo died in October 2012, having suffered from cancer for a lengthy period.

Early life and education Tissen was born on 3 June 1909 in Rumelange in the south of Luxembourg. After primary school in Rumelange, he attended the Lyc√©e Poincar√© in Nancy before studying painting and architecture at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris. There he met the Luxembourg sculptor Auguste Tr√©mont who not only became a key advisor but a close friend for the rest of his life. In 1929, he embarked on a lengthy world trip on a passenger liner before continuing his studies a few years later in Munich and Brussels. Career In 1939, together with other artists, he represented Luxembourg at the 1939 New York World's Fair. Back in Luxembourg where he wanted to be a teacher, he discovered that his French qualifications were not valid and he had to resit his school leaving certificate before he could be appointed. In September 1942, after taking part in the strike against the German occupation, he was deported together with seven other teachers to the Hinzert concentration camp where the inhuman conditions were to exert a profound influence on his work, calling for an ironic level of introspection.\\"Foni Tissen: Dossier de Presse\\". Retrieved 19 December 2010. Returning to Luxembourg after the war, he taught at the lyc√©e for boys in Esch-sur-Alzette where he deeply impressed his students. His art was not confined to painting but extended to mosaics, frescos, stained glass windows and ceramics, convinced as he was that art in all its forms could contribute to social consolidation. In his workshop, posters, plaques, flags, logos, medals and stamps were produced, some still in use today. An effective public speaker, he also became an active member of several art associations including Art Vivant in Differdange and Amiti√©s Fran√ßaises du Val de Kayl. Artistic work Tissen aimed to spread art to all parts of society in order to \\"elevate the spirit of man\\" as he put it. While his postage stamps, posters and the logo for the emergency services have become part of Luxembourg's collective memory, his close attachment to his native Rumelange and the area's Red Rocks can be seen in his landscapes and engravings.\\"Foni Tissen (1909-1975)\\" , European Institute of Cultural Routes. Retrieved 19 December 2010. The most typical part of his work is however the series of paintings he referred to as his Maennerscher or little men, many of them self- portraits constituting a human one-man comedy. The symbols he uses guide the spectator to the extensive workings of his imagination. All in all, his work reveals his search for what he called \\"the truth which is beauty and sincerity\\". When he died in Luxembourg City on 5 February 1975, Tissen left an extensive collection of paintings and other artistic artifacts, most of which are presented in the commemorative book R√©trospective Foni Tissen 100 Joer.\\"Foni Tissen 1909‚Äì1975\\" , Foni-Tissen.org.

Today Steenwick is known for a few keyboard pieces contained in a manuscript he compiled before 1674 for a pupil, Anna Maria van Eyl, daughter of an Arnhem patrician. The manuscript contains 33 pieces of music, including dances and arrangements of, and variations on, folksongs. Only nine compositions are signed by Steenwick, but more can be attributed to him on stylistic grounds. Among the securely attributed works are arrangements of popular songs such as More Palatino, Puer natus in Bethleem, and Heiligh saligh Bethlehem, and dances (sarabandes, allemandes) with variations.

He made a further 68 Challenge League appearances, scoring five times during his five-year tenure with the club. In May 2010, ahead of the 2010‚Äì11 Swiss Super League season, Kusunga signed for Swiss Super League side FC Basel, and was handed the number 21 shirt on his arrival. Kusunga made his debut for Basel on 20 July 2010, coming on as a 46th-minute substitute in the club's 3‚Äì2 home win against FC Z√ºrich. At the end of the 2010‚Äì11 Swiss Super League season Kusunga won the Super League Championship title with Basel and at the end of the 2011‚Äì12 season he won the Double, the League Championship title and the Swiss Cup, with Basel. Oldham Athletic Kusunga signed for Oldham Athletic until the end of the 2013‚Äì14 season on 2 September 2013, with the option of extending the deal until the summer of 2015. Kusunga was recommended to the Latics by Oldham legend, Joe Royle, his son Darren's agency heard about the player whilst scouting in Switzerland. Kusunga was offered more lucrative deals to clubs in Israel and Bulgaria but the sharp tongued Joe Royle stepped in along with his son to secure a deal with Lee Johnsons side. Kusunga scored his first goal for the club in the first round of the FA Cup, giving the Latics the lead against Wolverhampton Wanderers. Kusunga scored his first league goal on 25 January 2014 and it turned out to be a goal that will be remembered by Latics fans for many years to come, Oldham were 3‚Äì0 down against Peterborough United at half ‚Äì time and many of the Latics faithful thought that the game was all over, with a minority of the fans even leaving at half ‚Äì time, however, after the interval, the Latics got the score back to 3‚Äì2 and looked to have the momentum on their side to mount a comeback, however, they conceded again and the chances of that happening seemed to disappear with the scoreline at 4‚Äì2 but the Latics picked themselves up and scored straight away to make it 4‚Äì3 and the comeback was back on. Then in the dying minutes of the game, the Latics got a penalty and scored it to make it 4‚Äì4. And then something happened to turn the game into one of the most memorable games in Oldham's history, in the last seconds of the game, deep into injury time, Kusunga scrambled a shot into the back of the net from a corner in the 96th minute and Oldham won the game 5‚Äì4 after being 3‚Äì0 and 4‚Äì2 down during the game. The one ‚Äì year contract extension option that the club had on Kusunga was exercised, extending his contract till the end of the 2014‚Äì15 season. On 24 April 2015, Kusunga was released by Oldham.

The locomotive undertook trials in London in 1850 and was exhibited at The Great Exhibition in 1851. Description The invention of a successful mobile treadmill powered locomotive was made by Clemente Masserano from Pignerol in Italy. The idea was not new, but previous attempts in England, France and Spain had been unsuccessful. Using Messano's designs it was built in Italy and transported to England. A syndicate was formed and it was trialled at the Nine Elms terminus of the South Western Railway line in London where it successfully completed a hill climb. The trials were supported by the directors of the South Western Railway and assisted by their Chief Engineer John Gooch. The device was said to be much cheaper to run than a steam locomotive. The device allowed a steam locomotive to be replaced by this vehicle, which used the power of two or four horses that had to walk up a treadmill. The treadmill was called a pedivella by Masserano. The power was transferred to the wheels by chains and a gearbox that allowed it to climb. It was said to be able to pull 30 wagons up an incline and could be used with two or four horses. The gear box allowed the horses to always walk at their best speed whilst the vehicle could then have a range of speeds and torques. Because of the gears, the top speed was not limited to the top speed of the horses. The gearbox allowed the horses to drive the vehicle in forward as well as reverse directions, and it was also possible to disengage the drive so that the vehicle could stop whilst the horses continued to walk up the treadmill. The vehicle travelled at during the trials, but it was thought that a final version would reach and would outrun a steam engine. Cost and efficiency The efficiency of the device was compared favourably with existing steam locomotives, which were thought to waste too much energy. The cost of operating the Impulsoria was estimated at two shillings per day per horse. During that eight-hour day it was estimated that the horses could propel Impulsoria eight times over a thirty-mile route. Exhibition An Italian Professor of Philosophy, Dr Andrea Crestadoro, improved the design of this unusual device (and later took out patents in 1852). Following his improvements Crestadoro exhibited it at The Great Exhibition held in the Crystal Palace in 1851. After this date Crestadoro took an interest in bibliography and became a librarian in Manchester. The final tale of Impulsoria may be in Germany where a device of that name was exhibited in 1853. This device was said to be the property of a person named Steinheil.

She was appointed treasurer to the private charitable foundation of Charlene, Princess of Monaco, in 2017. Early life and career She was born in England (not in South Africa as is sometimes suggested) to a father who \\"worked in the wine trade\\", and traveled widely when young. She spent her childhood in Hongkong and Japan. Tina Green opened her first fashion boutique in Johannesburg, when she and her family moved to South Africa. Married to British retail businessman Sir Philip Green, her second husband, Tina Green owns all of the family shares in Jersey- registered Taveta Investments. As a result, she has been referred to as the wealthiest and second-wealthiest woman in the UK. Tina Green also co-founded an interior design firm, Green and Mingarelli Design. Taveta Investments Via Jersey-registered Taveta Investments and its subsidiaries, Green owns 2,300 shops in the United Kingdom. Taveta's assets include: * 92% of Arcadia Group, parent of Topshop, Burton and Dorothy Perkins *Sears 'Shoe Express' chain * 53% owner of Owen Owen HoldingsFinancial Mail Woman's Forum: \\"Uncovered: Green‚Äôs empress of Arcadia\\" by Michael Gillard and Ben Lauran 23 March 2003 *In September 1999, Green became a shareholder in the parent of Mark One *A ¬£23m-plus shareholding in Marks & Spencer during an attempt to purchase the company at the beginning of 2000 As a result, Taveta (and hence Green) controls 12% of the UK clothing retail market, making Taveta the second-largest operator in the sector. The leader, Marks & Spencer, has been the target of three unsuccessful takeover bids from Taveta. Criticism Green's wealth stems from her relationship with her second husband, British retail magnate Sir Philip Green. The arrangement between the married couple (with working-week London resident Sir Philip as the CEO or Chairman of all companies, while Tina Green remains the sole shareholder via Jersey-based Taveta Investments, but resident in Monaco) means that the couple minimise their UK taxation liability. As a result, Sir Philip has become the target of activist group UK Uncut, initially in November 2010, for his history of corporate tax avoidance. The group targeted Sir Philip specifically as a UK Government advisor. He became the focus of anger over the programme of government cuts that campaigners said could be avoided if tax dodging was stamped out, bringing in some ¬£25bn a year to the public purse and reducing the national debt. On 4 December 2010, campaigners staged a sit-in at Arcadia's flagship London Topshop store in Oxford Street. In Brighton, a few campaigners glued themselves to the branch's windows. Other high streets in towns and cities across Britain saw similar protests in a day of action against the tax arrangements of rich individuals and big businesses. Since Taveta Investments is owned by Tina Green, who resides in Monaco, protestors claim that the couple avoid paying ¬£285 million in UK personal income tax, that would be payable if a UK resident owned the company. In November 2005, Sir Philip approved a dividend payout that benefitted his family via Taveta/Tina Green by ¬£1.2bn, paid for by a loan taken out by Arcadia, cutting Arcadia's corporation tax as interest charges on the loan were offset against profits. The payout was the biggest annual dividend payout to an individual by a British company.  Personal life  Green has been married twice. She met her first husband, Robert \\"Bobby\\" Palos, a South African jazz drummer, in Hong Kong when she was 17 and he was 31. They married a year later. He subsequently became a retailer, and the marriage ended in divorce.Express UK: \\"HOW TO FEED YOUR MAN\\" By Julie Carpenter 17 November 2010 They had two children: artist and author Stasha Palos, and businessman Brett Palos.PropertyWeek.com: \\"Philip Green's stepson in property debut\\" By Laura Chesters 13 March 2009 She is currently married to Philip Green.

Relationship with Richard Caring  Tina Green has been linked to the British businessman Richard Caring, owner of the Annabel's nightclub and close friend of her husband Philip Green. Leaked HSBC documents proved that Tina Green held under her name assets for Richard Caring, who according to The Guardian received \\"¬£93m in BHS dividends from Sir Philip Green\\", while he was also a major supplier of BHS.

It powered a variety of mostly French aircraft in the mid-1930s, several on an experimental basis. Design and development During the 1930s Soci√©t√© Lorraine, which in 1937 was nationalised into the Soci√©t√© Nationale de Construction de Moteurs (SNCM), continued its tradition of building large water-cooled aeroengines. These later engines were named after birds: Eider, Courlis (en:curlew), P√©trel and Sterna. The last two remained in production in 1938. The P√©trel was an upright V-12 engine with two banks of six cylinders, arranged at 60¬∞ to each other, driving a common crankshaft. The cylinder blocks were bolted onto the crankcase, all light alloy parts. The crankcase came in two pieces, with seven crankshaft bearings in the upper section. Roller bearings were used at the crankshaft ends; the remaining five were plain. The upper crankcase section also had integrally cast water channels as part of the cooling system. Steel cylinder liners were screwed into the heads, with their lower parts projecting into the crankcase. Steel seats for valves and sparking plugs were shrunk into the heads. The pistons were forged from alugir, with three compression and one scraper ring and floating bronze bushes for the gudgeon pins. The twelve pistons were connected to the six crankpins in pairs, each with a master and an auxiliary connecting rod. The master rods had forked big ends with white metal bearings; the auxiliary rod ends ran between the forks on bronze bushes. The P√©trel had four overhead valves per cylinder, two exhaust and two inlet, in bronze valve guides. Each bank had its own overhead camshaft and each cam operated a pair of valves through T-shaped tappets, the stem of the T moving in a guide to avoid sideways force on the valve stems. There were two sparking plugs per cylinder and twin magnetos. A carburettor fed the mixture into the intake of the supercharger, at the rear of the engine. The P√©trel's output could be left or right handed; a Lorraine patent planet gearset, with six satellite gears, provided an 11:17 reduction of propeller shaft speed. Engine lubrication was by forcing pressurized oil through the crankshaft, with sump scavenging. The supercharger had its own lubrication system. First run in 1932, the early P√©trels produced only 370 kW (500 hp) but by 1938 the engine had been developed into the 12Hars model which gave 640 kW (860 hp). This variant was used by the Koolhoven F.K.55 fighter, where it drove a pair of counter-rotating, twin-bladed propellers. Operational history Like the Koolhoven F.K.55, many of the aircraft types to use the P√©trel were one-offs, testing the Lorraine against better known engines from Hispano-Suiza and Rolls-Royce but the Potez 542 version of the Potez 540 family were built in numbers, with 74 of these twin-engined, multi- role (bomber, reconnaissance and transport) aircraft supplied to the French and Spanish air forces.

Resolution Observations The Security Council recalled resolutions 1503 (2003) and 1534 (2004) which called for the completion of all ICTR cases by 2010. It noted however that the ICTR was unable to complete its work by 2010 and expressed concern at the loss of experienced staff at the tribunal, particularly as four judges were to be redeployed and one was to leave after the completion of their case. The Council was convinced of the necessity for appointing ad litem judges as a temporary measure to facilitate the completion of the ICTR's work. Acts Acting under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, the Council extended the terms of judges Joseph Asoka de Silva and Taghrid Hikmet in order for them to complete the Ndindiliyimana et al. case by March 2011, and the term of Joseph Masanche extended to allow the Hategekimana case to be completed by January 2011. It also reiterated the importance of adequate staffing at the ICTY for it to complete its work as soon as possible, calling upon the Secretariat and other United Nations bodies to address the issue. Finally, the number of ad litem judges serving at the tribunal was temporarily increased from nine to twelve, returning to a maximum of nine by December 31, 2011.

One night, after a social gathering with members of his old British Army regiment, Hugo and his friends go out for a drive. He accidentally runs over a woman, who dies at the scene. All but one of his friends urge Hugo to drive on. In his drunk state of mind, Hugo had imagined himself running over Ginny. Over the next few days, a psychological war ensues. Peter, Hugo's business associate, wants to use the cover-up to leverage power over the estate. Jamie, who's dating Hugo's sister, wants to go to the police to report it. Hugo's family closes ranks as Ginny and the rest side with Hugo, who fears that his arrest and imprisonment will ruin the family's reputation. As the police investigation closes in on Hugo, the power struggle leads to deadly consequences. At the end, Peter and Hugo murder Jamie and arrange it to look like a suicide‚Äîthat it had been Jamie driving the car that killed the woman‚Äîand he had killed himself out of guilt by throwing his dead body off a seaside cliff. The police believe the story and close the case, and the amoral Hugo gets away with everything as he continues his sordid and unwholesome life undisturbed.

The wreck was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. History The Cumberland prior to her sinking The Cumberland was constructed in 1871 by Melanchthan & Simpson of Port Robinson, Ontario for Perry & Company, a Toronto steamship line. The ship was launched on August 8, 1871. The Cumberland's design was typical of the sidewheel steamers built for Great Lakes travel in the 1840s-1880s. It was a wooden-hulled, sidewheel paddleboat, 208 feet in length at the keel and 214 feet in length total. The ship had a beam of 28 feet (48 feet overall), a draft of 10 feet 6 inches, and measured 750 tons gross. The ship was powered by a 400HP walking beam engine with a single boiler and possessed paddlewheels 30 feet in diameter. The Cumberland was built for Northern Railway of Canada, the parent company of the Toronto and Lake Superior Navigation Company, to run between Duluth, Minnesota and Collingwood or Owen Sound, Ontario, and was named For Fred W. Cumberland, Northern Railway's general manager. The ship first saw service in May 1871. During its service, the Cumberland was involved in a number of serious incidents. In November 1872, the ship was frozen in the ice in the St. Mary's River; most of the crew trekked on foot from the ship to Collingwood, Ontario; leaving a few cremembers and passengers on the vessel. The fate of those left aboard is not known, but it is likely the ship overwintered in the ice. In November 1874, the Cumberland was caught in a storm on its way to Thunder Bay. Caulking of the ship's hull came loose in several areas, and it began to take on water. To lighten the load, livestock on the deck was thrown overboard. The ship made it to port with six feet of water in the hold and promptly sank. In November 1875, the Cumberland was again caught in a storm, and was grounded near Silver Islet, Ontario. Luckily, there was little damage from this incident, and cargo and passengers soon arrived safely in Thunder Bay. In September 1876, the ship ran aground again, this time at Owen Sound. The wreck of the Cumberland In July 1877, the Cumberland was grounded for three days on a sand bar in the harbor at Nipigon. It arrived in Thunder Bay on July 24, three days behind schedule, and probably left the same day. However, once out of port, she began taking on water. The day was clear and dry, and passengers were transferred to another vessel. On July 25, 1877, the ship struck a reef near the Rock of Ages Light. The bow section of the ship was stuck solid aground. Other ships attempted to free the Cumberland, but she was stuck fast. Salvage operations began, with a number of tugs and other vessels attempting to save the ship. However, the wreck was rapidly deteriorating, and by August 12 salvage operations were given up. The ship broke apart entirely on August 18; sections remained visible for several weeks, but the ship was completely submerged by early September. The wreck today Diving the wreck of the Cumberland Large portions of the ship remain in 20 to 80 feet of water, including the wooden hull, side-wheel, and boiler. However, most of the superstructure is missing, as well as nearly all of the engine. The wreckage of the Cumberland is intermingled with some portions of the hull of the Henry Chisholm, which sank later in 1898, and not far from the remains of the George M. Cox. Approximately 40 dives were made to the Cumberland in 2009 out of 1062 dives made to wrecks in the Isle Royale National Park. The ship is significant as the only known example of this size, style, and age of ship available in Lake Superior as a shipwreck.

Valdemar was the eldest son and co-ruler of King Valdemar II of Denmark by his first wife, Dagmar of Bohemia. He did not outlive his father so was never a sole monarch. He is sometimes referred to as Valdemar III for example his tombstone reads in \\"Valdemar the Third, King of Denmark, son of Valdemar the Second\\". Although Valdemar III is more commonly used to denote a later king, Valdemar of Schleswig. Early life Valdemar was born in 1209. He was the eldest child from his father's first marriage. His mother, Queen Dagmar, died in childbirth in 1212, leaving her husband a widower with a young son; she had been very popular among the Danish people due to her piety and kindness to the common people. King Valdemar remarried two years later to Berengaria of Portugal. From this marriage Valdemar the Young gained four half-siblings: Sophie, Eric, Abel and Christopher. His new stepmother, a beautiful and haughty woman, unpopular and scorned by the Danish people, was a great contrast to Valdemar's mother Dagmar. When Berengaria died in childbirth herself in 1221, King Valdemar did not remarry. The Junior King At a meeting of the Danish magnates, which King Valdemar arranged at Sams√∏ in 1215, everyone agreed to swear an oath to Valdemar the Young, and shortly after he was elected co-king of Denmark at Viborg landsting, a practice originally practised by the French Capetian dynasty and later in many of European monarchies. Valdemar's Duchy of Schleswig passed to his younger brother Eric. During a great feast in Schleswig in the summer of 1218, with 15 bishops and 3 dukes present, Valdemar was anointed and crowned junior King of Denmark. He took part with his father in the unlucky hunt on the island of Ly√∏ in 1223, where both kings were taken prisoner by Henry I of Schwerin and Valdemar was imprisoned until the Easter of 1226.Medieval Danish Families: Valdemar (III) the Young, 1209‚Äì31 Count Henry demanded that Denmark surrender the land conquered in Holstein 20 years ago and become a vassal of the Holy Roman Emperor for father and son to be released. Danish envoys refused these terms and Denmark declared war. While the kings were in prison, most of the German territories tore themselves away from Denmark. Danish armies were dispatched to hold them in line. The war ended in defeat of the Danish troops under the command of Albert of Orlam√ºnde at M√∂lln in 1225. To secure their releases Valdemar II had to acknowledge the break away territories in Germany, pay 44,000 silver marks, sign a promise not to seek revenge on Count Henry and send his son Erik to prison instead. Death of Valdemar the Young, portrayed by the Danish painter Christian Emil Andersen, 1843. On 24 June 1229, the young king married Eleanor of Portugal, daughter of Afonso II of Portugal, at Ribe. The match had been arranged by Bishop Gunner of Viborg who the couple loved like a father. They had been married for two years when Queen Eleanor died in childbirth on 28 August 1231. The child was short-lived. On 28 November 1231, Valdemar the Young was accidentally shot while hunting at Refsn√¶s, near Kalundborg. He died the same day. Valdemar was praised for his mildness and kindness towards everyone and was very popular; the Latin elegy, which a cleric authored, when the kings were captured, mentions him in the best words of praise. It was a tremendous grief to the country when he was killed. He was buried at St. Bendt's Church, Ringsted beside his wife, Queen Eleanor. His father then made his younger half-brother Eric co-king. King Valdemar II died ten years later and was succeeded by Eric.

Course The River Kennett rises in the hills just west of Cowlinge Hall in western Suffolk at an altitude of around 108m above sea level. It flows north-east to the village of Cowlinge before turning west for around a mile, crossing the county border into Cambridgeshire in the parish of Kirtling. After only a couple of miles in Cambridgeshire it crosses back into Suffolk just north of Lidgate and flows north through Dalham and Moulton. At Kentford it forms the Suffolk-Cambridgeshire border for around a mile followed by a mile in Cambridgeshire just north of the village of Kennett, after which it again forms the county border for around three miles as it runs past Red Lodge. As it reaches Freckenham, it joins Lee Brook, a tributary of the River Lark, just south of Freckenham, at an altitude of around 10m. The river is generally dry in the summertime. Water level River Kennett at Ousden Guaging Station, December 2019 In recent years (since 2015) the river level has been very low, even in winter. Where it runs through the Lidgate/Ousden/Dalham areas, the river has been dry in winter. It has only been the presence of the sewage treatment works between Dalham and Moulton that has meant any water has flowed through Moulton in recent years, whether winter or summer. Thankfully, in early December 2019 the river in the above areas began to flow again, albeit only as a stream, thanks to much rain. This was not always the case, in the winter of 2013-4, there was extreme flooding. In Moulton on 7th February 2014 the river overflowed onto the road by the church and at one stage houses were threatened. History The villages of Kentford and Kennett both derive their names from the river. The name of the river is Celtic in origin, and its meaning is unknown. The exact course of the river has changed many times over the centuries. Some evidence of this can be inferred from its deviations from the Kennett parish boundary. At Moulton the river passes under a Grade-II*-listed 15th-century packhorse bridge. This bridge has four arches, indicating that the river was larger when the bridge was constructed.

The outdated public health advice demonstrates the lack of understanding of the disease and its actual causative factors. Seven cholera pandemics have occurred in the past 200 years, with the first pandemic originating in India in 1817. Additionally, there have been many documented cholera outbreaks, such as a 1991‚Äì1994 outbreak in South America and, more recently, the 2016‚Äì20 Yemen cholera outbreak.\\"Crisis in Yemen \\" Although much is known about the mechanisms behind the spread of cholera, this has not led to a full understanding of what makes cholera outbreaks happen in some places and not others. Lack of treatment of human feces and lack of treatment of drinking water greatly facilitate its spread. Bodies of water have been found to serve as a reservoir, and seafood shipped long distances can spread the disease. Between 1816 and 1923, the first six cholera pandemics occurred consecutively and continuously over time. Increased commerce, migration, and pilgrimage are credited for its transmission. Late in this period (particularly 1879-1883), major scientific breakthroughs towards the treatment of cholera develop: the first immunization by Pasteur, the development of the first cholera vaccine, and the identification of the bacterium Vibrio cholerae by Filippo Pacini and Robert Koch. After a long hiatus, the seventh cholera pandemic spread in 1961. The pandemic subsided in 1970s, but continued on a smaller scale, with outbreaks across the developing world to the current day. Epidemics occurred after wars, civil unrest, or natural disasters, when water and food supplies become contaminated with Vibrio cholerae, and also due to crowded living conditions and poor sanitation. Deaths in India between 1817 and 1860, in the first three pandemics of the nineteenth century, are estimated to have exceeded 15 million people. Another 23 million died between 1865 and 1917, during the next three pandemics. Cholera deaths in the Russian Empire during a similar time period exceeded 2 million. Pandemics The first cholera pandemic occurred in the Bengal region of India, near Calcutta starting in 1817 through 1824. The disease dispersed from India to Southeast Asia, the Middle East, Europe, and Eastern Africa through trade routes. The second pandemic lasted from 1826 to 1837 and particularly affected North America and Europe due to the result of advancements in transportation and global trade, and increased human migration, including soldiers. The third pandemic erupted in 1846, persisted until 1860, extended to North Africa, and reached South America, for the first time specifically affecting Brazil. The fourth pandemic lasted from 1863 to 1875 spread from India to Naples and Spain. The fifth pandemic was from 1881‚Äì1896 and started in India and spread to Europe, Asia, and South America. The sixth pandemic started in India and was from 1899‚Äì1923. These epidemics were less fatal due to a greater understanding of the cholera bacteria. Egypt, the Arabian peninsula, Persia, India, and the Philippines were hit hardest during these epidemics, while other areas, like Germany in 1892 and Naples from 1910‚Äì1911, also experienced severe outbreaks. The seventh pandemic originated in 1961 in Indonesia and is marked by the emergence of a new strain, nicknamed El Tor, which still persists (as of 2019) in developing countries. Cholera did not occur in the Americas for most of the 20th century after the early 1900s in New York City. It reappeared in the Caribbean toward the end of that century and seems likely to persist. First, 1817‚Äì1824 First cholera pandemic The first cholera pandemic, though previously restricted, began in Bengal, and then spread across India by 1820. Hundreds of thousands of Indians and ten thousand British troops died during this pandemic. The cholera outbreak extended as far as China, Indonesia (where more than 100,000 people succumbed on the island of Java alone) and the Caspian Sea in Europe, before receding. Second, 1829‚Äì1837 A second cholera pandemic reached Russia (see Cholera Riots), Hungary (about 100,000 deaths) and Germany in 1831; it killed 130,000 people in Egypt that year.Cholera Epidemic in Egypt (1947) . In 1832 it reached London and the United Kingdom (where more than 55,000 people died) and Paris. In London, the disease claimed 6,536 victims and came to be known as \\"King Cholera\\"; in Paris, 20,000 died (of a population of 650,000), and total deaths in France amounted to 100,000. In 1833, a cholera epidemic killed many Pomo people which were a Native American tribe. The epidemic reached Quebec, Ontario, Nova Scotia and New York in the same year, and the Pacific coast of North America by 1834. In the center of the country, it spread through the cities linked by the rivers and steamboat traffic. Similarly, in Washington DC (where there are no reliable mortality figures), Michael Shiner, an enslaved laborer at the Washington Navy Yard recorded, ‚ÄúThe time the colery [cholera] broke out in about June and July August and September 1832 it Raged in the City of Washington and every day they wher [were] twelve or 13 carried out to they [their] graves a day.\\"Diary of Michael Shiner Relating to the History of the Washington Navy Yard 1813‚Äì1869 https://www.history.navy.mil/research/library/online-reading- room/title-list-alphabetically/d/diary-of-michael-shiner/introduction.html Naval History and Heritage Command 2015, 49 editor John G. Sharp Retrieved 7 March 2019 By late July 1832 cholera had spread to Virginia and on 7 August 1832, Commodore Lewis Warrington confirmed to the Secretary of the Navy Levi Woodbury cholera was at the Gosport Navy Yard, ‚ÄúBetween noon of that day, [1 August] and the morning of Friday [3 August], when all work on board her USS Fairfield stopped, several deaths by cholera occurred and fifteen or sixteen cases (of less violence) were reported.\\"Sharp, John G.

Cholera afflicted Mexico's populations in 1833 and 1850, prompting officials to quarantine some populations and fumigate buildings, particularly in major urban centers, but nonetheless the epidemics were disastrous.Gabriela Soto Laveaga and Claudia Agostoni, \\"Science and Public Health in the Century of Revolution\\" in A Companion to Mexican History and Culture, ed. William H. Beezley. Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2011, p. 562. During this pandemic, the scientific community varied in its beliefs about the causes of cholera. In France doctors believed cholera was associated with the poverty of certain communities or poor environment. Russians believed the disease was contagious, although doctors did not understand how it spread. The United States believed that cholera was brought by recent immigrants, specifically the Irish, and epidemiologists understand they were carrying disease from British ports. Lastly, some British thought the disease might rise from divine intervention. The social importance of the government having a direct role in the development and application of science was demonstrated through the U.S. Government's support of efforts to control the epidemic. Third, 1846‚Äì1860 A pump memorializing John Snow for his study of contaminated water as a likely source of cholera during the 1854 Broad Street Cholera outbreak The third cholera pandemic deeply affected Russia, with over one million deaths. Over 15,000 people died of cholera in Mecca in 1846.Asiatic Cholera Pandemic of 1846‚Äì63 . UCLA School of Public Health. A two-year outbreak began in England and Wales in 1848, and claimed 52,000 lives.Cholera's seven pandemics , cbc.ca, December 2, 2008. In 1849, a second major outbreak occurred in France. In London, it was the worst outbreak in the city's history, claiming 14,137 lives, over twice as many as the 1832 outbreak. Cholera hit Ireland in 1849 and killed many of the Irish Famine survivors, already weakened by starvation and fever. In 1849, cholera claimed 5,308 lives in the major port city of Liverpool, England, an embarkation point for immigrants to North America, and 1,834 in Hull, England. An outbreak in North America took the life of former U.S. President James K. Polk. Cholera, believed spread from Irish immigrant ships from England, spread throughout the Mississippi river system, killing over 4,500 in St. Louis and over 3,000 in New Orleans. Thousands died in New York, a major destination for Irish immigrants. Cholera claimed 200,000 victims in Mexico. That year, cholera was transmitted along the California, Mormon and Oregon Trails as 6,000 to 12,000 are believed to have died on their way to the California Gold Rush, Utah and Oregon in the cholera years of 1849‚Äì1855. It is believed more than 150,000 Americans died during the two pandemics between 1832 and 1849.Vibrio cholerae in recreational beach waters and tributaries of Southern California. In 1851, a ship coming from Cuba carried the disease to Gran Canaria.HISTORICAL GEOGRAPHICAL APPROACH IN THE BEHAVIOR OF THE EPIDEMIC OF THE CHOLERA MORBUS OF 1851 IN THE PALMS OF GREAT CANARY p.626 It is considered that more than 6,000 people died in the island during summer,Historia de la medicina en Gran Canaria p.545-546 out of a population of 58,000. In 1852, cholera spread east to Indonesia, and later was carried to Indonesia and Japan in 1854. The Philippines were infected in 1858 and Korea in 1859. In 1859, an outbreak in Bengal contributed to transmission of the disease by travelers and troops to Iran, Iraq, Arabia and Russia. Japan suffered at least seven major outbreaks of cholera between 1858 and 1902. Between 100,000 and 200,000 people died of cholera in Tokyo in an outbreak in 1858‚Äì60.Kaoru Sugihara, Peter Robb, Haruka Yanagisawa, Local Agrarian Societies in Colonial India: Japanese Perspectives, (1996), p. 313. In 1854, an outbreak of cholera in Chicago took the lives of 5.5 percent of the population (about 3,500 people).Chicago Daily Tribune , 12 July 1854 Providence, Rhode Island suffered an outbreak so widespread that for the next thirty years, 1854 was known there as \\"The Year of Cholera.\\" In 1853‚Äì54, London's epidemic claimed 10,739 lives. The 1854 Broad Street Cholera outbreak in London ended after the physician John Snow identified a neighborhood Broad Street pump as contaminated and convinced officials to remove its handle. His study proved contaminated water was the main agent spreading cholera, although he did not identify the contaminant. It would take many years for this message to be believed and fully acted upon. In Spain, over 236,000 died of cholera in the epidemic of 1854‚Äì55. The disease reached South America in 1854 and 1855, with victims in Venezuela and Brazil. During the third pandemic, Tunisia, which had not been affected by the two previous pandemics, thought Europeans had brought the disease. They blamed their sanitation practices. Some United States scientists began to believe that cholera was somehow associated with African Americans, as the disease was prevalent in the South in areas of black populations. Current researchers note their populations were underserved in terms of sanitation infrastructure, and health care, and they lived near the waterways by which travelers and ships carried the disease. From November 10, 1855 to December 1856 the disease spread through Puerto Rico claiming 25,820 victims. Cemeteries were expanded to allow for the burial of victims of cholera. Fourth, 1863‚Äì1875 The fourth cholera pandemic of the century began in the Ganges Delta of the Bengal region and traveled with Muslim pilgrims to Mecca. In its first year, the epidemic claimed 30,000 of 90,000 Mecca pilgrims. Cholera spread throughout the Middle East and was carried to Russia, Europe, Africa and North America, in each case spreading from port cities and along inland waterways. The pandemic reached Northern Africa in 1865 and spread to sub-Saharan Africa, killing 70,000 in Zanzibar in 1869‚Äì70. Cholera claimed 90,000 lives in Russia in 1866.Eastern European Plagues and Epidemics 1300‚Äì1918 . The epidemic of cholera that spread with the Austro-Prussian War (1866) is estimated to have taken 165,000 lives in the Austrian Empire, including 30,000 each in Hungary and Belgium and 20,000 in the Netherlands. Other deaths from cholera at the time included 115,000 in Germany,90,000 in Russia and 30,000 in Belgium. In London in June 1866, a localized epidemic in the East End claimed 5,596 lives, just as the city was completing construction of its major sewage and water treatment systems (see London sewerage system); the East End section was not quite complete. Epidemiologist William Farr identified the East London Water Company as the source of the contamination. Farr made use of prior work by John Snow and others pointing to contaminated drinking water as the likely cause of cholera in an 1854 outbreak. Quick action prevented further deaths. In the same year, the use of contaminated canal water in local water works caused a minor outbreak at Ystalyfera in South Wales. Workers associated with the company and their families were most affected, and 119 died. In 1867, Italy lost 113,000 lives and 80,000 died of the disease in Algeria. Outbreaks in North America in the 1870s killed some 50,000 Americans as cholera spread from New Orleans to other ports along the Mississippi River and its tributaries. None of the cities had adequate sanitation systems, and cholera spread through the water supply and contact. (New citation needed‚Äîcitation (#15) \\"The 1832 Cholera Epidemic ‚Äì Part 2\\" does not mention the 1870s outbreak briefly mentioned here). Fifth, 1881‚Äì1896 1892 cholera outbreak in Hamburg, hospital ward The fifth cholera pandemic, according to Dr A. J. Wall, the 1883‚Äì1887 part of the epidemic cost 250,000 lives in Europe and at least 50,000 in the Americas. Cholera claimed 267,890 lives in Russia (1892); 120,000 in Spain; 90,000 in Japan and over 60,000 in Persia. In Egypt, cholera claimed more than 58,000 lives. The 1892 outbreak in Hamburg killed 8,600 people. Although the city government was generally held responsible for the virulence of the epidemic, it went largely unchanged. This was the last serious European cholera outbreak, as cities improved their sanitation and water systems. Sixth, 1899‚Äì1923 The sixth cholera pandemic had little effect in western Europe because of advances in public health, but major Russian cities and the Ottoman Empire were particularly hard hit by cholera deaths. More than 500,000 people died of cholera in Russia from 1900 to 1925, which was also a time of social disruption because of revolution and warfare. The 1902‚Äì1904 cholera epidemic claimed 200,000 lives in the Philippines1900s: The Epidemic years , Society of Philippine Health History. including their revolutionary hero and first prime minister Apolinario Mabini. Cholera broke out 27 times during the hajj at Mecca from the 19th century to 1930. The sixth pandemic killed more than 800,000 in India. The last outbreak in the United States was in 1910‚Äì1911, when the steamship Moltke brought infected people from Naples to New York City. Vigilant health authorities isolated the infected in quarantine on Swinburne Island. Eleven people died, including a health care worker at the hospital on the island. In this time period, because immigrants and travelers often carried cholera from infected locales, the disease became associated with outsiders in each society. The Italians blamed the Jews and gypsies, the British who were in India accused the ‚Äúdirty natives‚Äù, and the Americans thought the disease came from the Philippines. Seventh, 1961‚Äì1975 The seventh cholera pandemic began in Indonesia, called El Tor after the strain, and reached East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) in 1963, India in 1964, and the Soviet Union in 1966. From North Africa, it spread into Italy by 1973. In the late 1970s, there were small outbreaks in Japan and in the South Pacific. There was an outbreak in Odessa in July 1970 and there were also many reports of a cholera outbreak near Baku in 1972, but information about it was suppressed in the Soviet Union. In 1970, a cholera outbreak struck the Saƒümalcƒ±lar district of Istanbul, then an impoverished slum, claiming more than 50 lives; eventually the notoriety of the incident led to the renaming of the district as Bayrampa≈üa. Also in 1970, a few cases were reported in Jerusalem in August. Recent outbreaks Vibrio cholerae has shown to be a very potent pathogenic bacterium causing many pandemics and epidemics over the past three centuries. However, most outbreaks are known to be self-limiting, meaning they come to an end after peaking without human intervention. One of the mechanisms significantly determining the course of epidemics is phage predation. This process is strongly dependent on successful recognition of the bacteria by lytic phages, in which cell surface receptors play a crucial role. Bacteria can reduce their susceptibility by changing their surface receptors and thus preventing phage adsorption. In the case of V. cholerae, the changed receptor gene expression is due to an alteration in cell-density during its infection cycle, a process called quorum sensing (QS). The stool samples collected from patients contain clumps of bacterial cells, demonstrating the occurrence of cell-cell interaction in the latter stage of the infection cycle. QS is strongly regulated by two auto-inducer molecules, AI-2 and CAI-1. Evidently, these molecules will have a significant impact on the success of phage predation in V. cholerae infections. A previous study has unravelled the mode of action of auto-inducers on preventing predation on the level of phage entry. The study has shown that the aforementioned auto- inducers downregulate the ten biosynthetic genes of the surface O-antigen which is primarily used as a phage receptor for Vibriophages. This mechanism results in an increased phage resistance. It can be stated that the loss of the ability to produce the receptor, reduces the possibility of a phage- dependent limitation or even elimination of V. cholerae. This should be kept in mind when developing a treatment for enteric bacterial infections with phages as an intervention tool. Future approaches may include additional quorum regulators that operate as ‚Äúquorum quenchers‚Äù to reduce quorum-mediated phage resistance. 1990s * January 1991 ‚Äì September 1994: Outbreak in South America, apparently initiated when a Chinese ship discharged ballast water. Beginning in Peru, there were 1.04 million identified cases and almost 10,000 deaths. The causative agent was an O1, El Tor strain, with small differences from the seventh pandemic strain. In 1992 a new strain appeared in Asia, a non-O1, nonagglutinable vibrio (NAG), which was named O139 Bengal. It was first identified in Tamil Nadu, India and for a while displaced El Tor in southern Asia. It decreased in prevalence from 1995 to around 10 percent of all cases. It is considered to be an intermediate between El Tor and the classic strain, and occurs in a new serogroup. Scientists warn of evidence of wide-spectrum resistance by cholera bacteria to drugs such as trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole and streptomycin. * An outbreak in Goma, Democratic Republic of Congo in July 1994 claimed 12,000 lives by mid-August. During the worst period, it is estimated that as many as 3,000 people were dying per day from cholera. * A persistent strain of Gulf Coast cholera, 01, has been found in the brackish waters of marshes in Louisiana and Texas in the United States, leading to a situation of possible transmission by shipments of seafood from those areas to other parts of the country. Medical personnel were advised to think of cholera when assessing symptoms for people who had not been traveling. There have been occurrences in the South but no major outbreaks because of good sanitation and warning systems. It was noted there were more cases in two years from the Latin American epidemic, the El Tor strain, than in 20 years from the Gulf Coast strain.  2000s  * In 2000, some 140,000 cholera cases were officially reported to WHO. Countries in Africa accounted for 87 percent of these cases.Disease fact sheet: Cholera .

The CFR had remained above 4.7% for most of January and early February 2009. 2010s * August 2010: Cholera in Nigeria was reaching epidemic proportions after widespread confirmation of the disease outbreaks in 12 of its 36 states. 6400 cases were reported with 352 reported deaths. The health ministry blamed the outbreak on heavy seasonal rainfall and poor sanitation.Cholera epidemic death toll rises to 352 , MSNBC, 25 August 2010. * October 2010 ‚Äì presently, Haiti and Dominican Republic: Late in October 2010, an outbreak was reported in Haiti. As of November 16, the Haitian Health Ministry reported the number of dead to be 1,034, with hospitalizations for cholera symptoms totaling over 16,700. The outbreak was blamed on a camp of Nepalese United Nations peacekeepers; this was disputed then acknowledged by the United Nations. The outbreak started on the upper Artibonite River; people first contracted the disease by taking water from this river. In addition, some scientists think the hurricane and weather conditions in Haiti worsened the consequences of the outbreak, and damaged sanitation systems allowed it to spread.Aubrey Ann Parker, \\"Cholera in Haiti: the Climate Connection\\" , Circle of Blue, 2010 By November 2010, the disease had spread into the neighboring Dominican Republic. As of August 2016, the epidemic has officially sickened at least 790,000 people and killed more than 9,000 in Haiti, but the real burden is probably much higher. In the neighboring Dominican Republic, there have been at least 32,000 suspected cases and 500 related deaths. In Haiti, the outbreak was worsened by Hurricane Matthew, which hit the southern portion of Haiti in fall 2016. The UN has acknowledged its role in the epidemic. In August 2016, the UN pledged to fight the disease and provide assistance for victims through a $400 million fund; But, as of April 2017, member states had contributed a meagre $10 million of the $400 million pledged. * In January 2011, about 411 Venezuelan citizens attended a wedding in the Dominican Republic, where they ate ceviche (raw fish cooked in lemon juice) at the celebration. By the time they returned to Caracas and other Venezuelan cities, some of these travelers were suffering from symptoms of cholera. By January 28, almost 111 cases had been confirmed by the Venezuelan Health Authorities, who quickly set up an 800 number for people to call who wondered whether they were infected. Internationally, Colombia secured its eastern border against immigrants and probable transmission of the disease. Dominican officials started a nationwide study to determine the cause of the outbreak, and warned residents of the imminent danger associated with the consumption of raw fish and shellfish. As of January 29, 2011, none of the cases in Venezuela proved fatal, but two patients were hospitalized. Since the victims had quickly sought help, the outbreak was detected and contained., WRAL * 2011: Nigeria and Democratic Republic of Congo have had outbreaks; the latter has suffered years of disruption from warfare. Somalia has suffered a double hit of cholera and famine, associated with the refugee camps, limited sanitation, and severe drought, causing famine and lowered resistance.Jeffrey Gettleman / New York Times News Service, \\"U.N.: Cholera scourge now ravaging Somalia\\" , Bend Bulletin, 13 August 2011 * Cholera outbreak in 2011 and 2012 in multiple African nations, in all regions except North Africa; among the affected nations Ghana has led an intense campaign for handwashing. In Sierra Leone, some 21,500 cases, with 290 deaths reported in 2012. * On August 21, 2013, the United States State Department issued a security message warning U.S. citizens in or traveling to Cuba about an outbreak of cholera in Havana. It may be linked to a reported outbreak of cholera in eastern Cuba. * An ongoing cholera outbreak in Ghana in 2014, hitting hard the capital Accra, has claimed some 100 lives and over 11,000 cases by September. It did not gain much notice because of being overshadowed by Ebola news in nearby countries. In 2011 and 2012 Ghana had cholera epidemics combined that totaled 16,000 cases and 130 deaths. * September 2015: Ongoing cholera epidemic in Tanzania resulting in 13 deaths and almost 1000 cases so far‚Äîmainly in Dar es Salaam, but also in Morogoro and Iringa, caused by the O1 Ogawa strain. There had been an earlier outbreak in the lake Tanganyika area, starting in the refugee population who had fled from Burundi. 30 deaths and 4400 cases were reported in May 2015. * Somalia, 2017: An ongoing outbreak started in January 2017 in Somalia. By the end of May, there were more than 50,000 cases, associated with 880 deaths; the case fatality rate is 1.7% (2.1% in children). Sixteen of the country's eighteen regions are involved, with the worst affected being Bay and Togdheer. * In April 2017, an outbreak resurged in Yemen (it had started in October 2016). UNICEF and the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that, by 24 June 2017, the total cases in the country exceeded 200,000, with 1,300 deaths. UNICEF and WHO attributed the outbreak to malnutrition, disrupted sanitation, and interrupted access to clean water due to the country's ongoing civil war. The impacts of the outbreak were exacerbated by the collapse of Yemeni health services; many health workers have remained unpaid for months. The outbreak occurred ten days after the sewerage systems in the Yemeni capital of Sana'a stopped working on 17 April. Approximately half of the cases, and a quarter of the deaths, were among children. On 14 August, WHO stated that about 500,000 people in Yemen were affected by cholera. WHO called it \\"the worst cholera outbreak in the world\\". * In August 2018, The Algerian Ministry of Health announced that 56 cases of cholera were confirmed in the regions of the capital Algiers and surrounding provinces of Tipaza, Blida, Bouira, Medea and Ain Defla, with reports of 2 deaths as a result of this cholera epidemic. A water source in the town of Hamr El-Ain, Tipaza was found to have been the origin of cholera contamination. The access to the water source was restricted. *In September 6, 2018, a cholera outbreak was declared in Zimbabwe. The Government declared state of emergency on September 11, 2018. The outbreak has so far killed 48 people, and there are at least 98 confirmed cases as of September 27, 2018. False reports A persistent urban myth states 90,000 people died in Chicago of cholera and typhoid fever in 1885, but this story has no factual basis. In 1885, a torrential rainstorm flushed the Chicago River and its attendant pollutants into Lake Michigan far enough that the city's water supply was contaminated. But, as cholera was not present in the city, there were no cholera-related deaths. As a result of the pollution, the city made changes to improve its treatment of sewage and avoid similar events. In popular culture Unlike tuberculosis (\\"consumption\\") which in literature and the arts was often romanticized as a disease of denizens of the demimondaine or those with an artistic temperament,Sontag Susan (1977) Illness as Metaphor / AIDS and Its Metaphors. New York: Picador. cholera is a disease which almost entirely affects the lower-classes living in filth and poverty. This, and the unpleasant course of the disease - which includes voluminous \\"rice-water\\" diarrhea, the hemorrhaging of liquids from the mouth, and violent muscle contractions which continue even after death - has discouraged the disease from being romanticized, or even the actual factual presentation of the disease in popular culture. *The 1889 novel Mastro-don Gesualdo by Giovanni Verga presents the course of a cholera epidemic across the island of Sicily, but does not show the suffering of the victims. *In Thomas Mann's novella Death in Venice, first published in 1912 as Der Tod in Venedig, Mann \\"presented the disease as emblematic of the final 'bestial degradation' of the sexually transgressive author Gustav von Aschenbach.\\" Contrary to the actual facts of how violently cholera kills, Mann has his protagonist die peacefully on a beach in a deck chair. Luchino Visconti's 1971 film version also hid from the audience the actual course of the disease. Mann's novella was also made into an opera by Benjamin Britten in 1973, his last one, and into a ballet by John Neumeier for his Hamburg Ballet company, in December 2003.In Gabriel Garcia M√°rquez's 1985 novel Love in the Time of Cholera, cholera is \\"a looming background presence rather than a central figure requiring vile description.\\" The novel was adapted in 2007 for the film of the same name directed by Mike Newell.

Lady Hills-Johnes had in her early days been a ward of Lady Llanover moving in fashionable and literary circles, her \\"life on one occasion\\" being saved by the great Lord Lytton. Her correspondence with the famous Bishop of St Davids, Dr Connop Thirlwall, was published in 1881 under the title ‚ÄòLetters to a Friend‚Äô. Dolaucothi House was always full of guests, among them many distinguished men and women, not least Field Marshal the Earl Roberts (1832‚Äì1914) and Sir Henry Morton Stanley (1841‚Äì1904), explorer of Africa.A House That Borrow Admired (H.J. Lloyd Johnes) Available at Lord Roberts and Sir James began their lifelong friendship as cadets at Addiscombe Military Seminary. Roberts joined the Bengal Horse Artillery in 1851, and Sir James, 11 months his junior, was commissioned into the same corps in 1853. Both experienced the dangers and perils of the Indian Mutiny, were present at the Siege of Delhi and took part in the operations at the Relief of Lucknow. Both were dangerously wounded at the Siege of Delhi and before the Mutiny ended, they both were awarded the Victoria Cross. A decade later they served together again in the Abyssinian and Kabul campaigns and in 1881 the pair received thanks from both Houses of Parliament.History of Caio, Carmarthenshire (Fred S. Price, 1904), B Trerise, Prince of Wales Road Charlotte Johnes died in 1911, Sir James in 1919 and Lady Johnes-Hill at the grand age of 95 in 1927. Upon their deaths the Dolaucothi estate passed through a female line to the Lloyds who then added the additional surname of Johnes. The house was requisitioned by the Ministry of Supply during World War II when it fell into serious disrepair with floors collapsing and lead being removed from the roof. Dolaucothi was presented to the National Trust in 1941 subject to the life interest of its last owner, Major Herbert Lloyd- Johneswww.burkespeerage.com following whose death, in 1956, the property and lordship of the manor became wholly owned by the National Trust.

Larger efforts to extract gold were undertaken from 1888 to 1892 by the South Wales Gold Mining Co, in 1905‚Äì1910, and in 1933‚Äì38, when Britain‚Äôs abandonment of the gold standard led to a much greater interest in native gold.The Buildings of Wales ‚Äì Carmarthen and Ceredigion ‚Äì Thomas Lloyd, Julian Orbach and Robert Scourfield, Yale University Press, 2006 Later attempts to extract gold in commercially viable quantities have been unsuccessful, although interest naturally remains in the area's deposits.www.nationaltrust.org.uk See also * Colonel Thomas Johnes * Destruction of country houses in 20th-century Britain References Sources *  External links  * Carmarthenshire War Memorial * VC recipient's grave Dyfed, Wales * History of Carmarthenshire Archaeological sites in Carmarthenshire Buildings and structures in Carmarthenshire Welsh country houses destroyed in the 20th century Former country houses in the United Kingdom ","title":"Dolaucothi Estate"},{"id":"30111335","text":"Szabina Mayer (born 24 March 1988) is a Hungarian handballer for Szombathelyi KKA.

Resolution 1956, along with resolutions 1957 (2010) and 1958 (2010), ended some major restrictions placed on Iraq. However, demands that Iraq resolve disputes with Kuwait remained. The high-level meeting was chaired by United States Vice President Joe Biden. Resolution Observations The Security Council began by welcoming the letter from the Prime Minister of Iraq, Nouri al-Maliki which reaffirmed the commitment of the Iraqi government not to request further extensions of arrangements for the Development Fund for Iraq, and that revenues from oil would be used fairly. It recalled the significant role of the Development Fund and the International Advisory and Monitoring Board. Acts Acting under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, the Council decided to terminate arrangements established in Resolution 1483 (2003) for depositing proceeds from exports of petroleum, petroleum products and natural gas into the Development Fund for Iraq and its monitoring by the International Advisory and Monitoring Board on June 30, 2011. After this date, the arrangements would not apply, and 5 percent of the proceeds would be deposited in the Compensation Fund established in Resolution 687 (1991). The resolution called upon the Iraqi government to work with the Secretary-General towards a post-Development Fund mechanism, with a full transfer of its funds to government successor account by June 30, 2011. The Secretary-General was instructed to provide reports every six months on progress.

It proposed an integrated vision of education based on two key concepts, ‚Äòlearning throughout life‚Äô and the four pillars of learning, to know, to do, to be and to live together. It was not in itself a blueprint for educational reform, but rather a basis for reflection and debate about what choices should be made in formulating policies. The report argued that choices about education were determined by choices about what kind of society we wished to live in. Beyond education‚Äôs immediate functionality, it considered the formation of the whole person to be an essential part of education‚Äôs purpose. The Delors Report was aligned closely with the moral and intellectual principles that underpin UNESCO, and therefore its analysis and recommendations were more humanistic and less instrumental and market-driven than other education reform studies of the time. The Delors Report identified a number of tensions generated by technological, economic and social change. They included tensions between the global and the local; the universal and the particular; tradition and modernity; the spiritual and the material; long term and short term considerations; the need for competition and the ideal of equality of opportunity; and the expansion of knowledge and our capacity to assimilate it. These seven tensions remain useful perspectives from which to view the current dynamics of social transformation. Some are taking on new meaning, with fresh tensions emerging. These include patterns of economic growth characterized by rising vulnerability, growing inequality, increased ecological stress, and rising intolerance and violence. Finally, while there has been progress in human rights, implementation of norms often remains a challenge.  The Four Pillars of Education  One of the most influential concepts of the 1996 Delors Report was that of the four pillars of learning. Formal education, the report argued, tends to emphasize certain types of knowledge to the detriment of others that are essential to sustaining human development. # Learning to know ‚Äì a broad general knowledge with the opportunity to work in depth on a small number of subjects. # Learning to do ‚Äì to acquire not only occupational skills but also the competence to deal with many situations and to work in teams. # Learning to be ‚Äì to develop one‚Äôs personality and to be able to act with growing autonomy, judgment and personal responsibility. # Learning to live together ‚Äì by developing an understanding of other people and an appreciation of interdependence. The idea of the integrated approach to education reflected in the four pillars of learning has had significant influence on policy debates, teacher training and curriculum development in a range of countries worldwide. It is important to note that the four pillars of learning were envisaged against the backdrop of the notion of ‚Äòlifelong learning‚Äô, itself an adaptation of the concept of ‚Äòlifelong education‚Äô as initially conceptualized in the 1972 Faure publication Learning to Be.Tawil, S. and Cougoureux, M. 2013.

He received the first prize of the German Society of Research on Latin America/ADLAF in 1994 for his PhD thesis (which was published in Germany) about the urban question in Brazil, and the Jabuti Award (this prize is given every year to Brazil‚Äôs best literary and scientific works by the Brazilian Book Chamber) for his book O desafio metropolitano (The Metropolitan Challenge) in 2001. His book Fob√≥pole: O medo generalizado e a militariza√ß√£o da quest√£o urbana (Phobopolis: Generalised Fear and the Militarisation of the Urban Question), published in 2008, was nominated for the Jabuti Award in 2009. Intellectual Contribution He pioneered the study of spatiality and the social production of space from an ‚Äòautonomist‚Äô perspective (mainly inspired by Cornelius Castoriadis‚Äôs political-philosophical work) as early as in the 1980s. Marcelo Lopes de Souza regards himself as a 'libert√°rio' (left- libertarian). From his viewpoint, the (left-)libertarian thought and praxis encompasses not only anarchism (or, as he prefers, ‚Äòclassical anarchism‚Äô) - second half of the 19th century and first half of the 20th century - and neo- anarchism - from the second half of the 20th century onwards (for instance, Murray Bookchin) -, but also ‚Äòautonomist libertarian‚Äô authors (such as Castoriadis) and movements (such as Mexican Zapatistas, a large part of Argentine ‚Äòpiqueteros,‚Äô and so on). His research projects have covered several themes related to the interdisciplinary field of urban studies and, more recently, to the interface of urban studies and political ecology. He has contributed to critical environmental geography and political ecology (especially urban political ecology) from a left-libertarian perspective, focusing above all on the problems of environmental injustice and the conservative (or conservatively instrumentalised) discourses about environmental risk and protection. Studies He studied geography and urban sociology in Brazil in the 1980s, and received his PhD degree in geography (Nebenfach [minor]: political science) from the University of T√ºbingen (Germany) in 1993. Career He acted as a visiting researcher at the Geography Department of the University of T√ºbingen (1996 and 2000/2001) and at the Geography Department of the Royal Holloway College, University of London (1999), as well as a visiting professor at the Habitat Unit of the Technical University of Berlin (2005), at the Graduate Programme on Latin American Studies of the Universidad Nacional Aut√≥noma de M√©xico/UNAM (2008), at the Europa-Universit√§t Viadrina in Frankfurt [Oder] (2009-2010), at the Colegio de Geograf√≠a of the Universidad Nacional Aut√≥noma de M√©xico/UNAM (2012) and at the Department of Political Science and International Relations of the Universidad Aut√≥noma de Madrid (2013-2014). Since the mid-1990s, Marcelo Lopes de Souza has acted as a coordinator or co-coordinator of a number of research projects, which have covered themes such as: urban violence and the ‚Äòmilitarisation of the urban question‚Äô in different countries; potentialities, limits and problems of ‚Äòparticipative urban planning and management‚Äô; the spatial practices of emancipative social movements in Brazil, Argentina, Mexico and South Africa; and environmental (in)justice and urban-environmental struggles in Brazil. He founded the Rede de Pesquisadores em Geografia (Socio)Ambiental (Network of Research on [Socio-Environmental Geography]) in 2017, whose focus is on critical environmental geography and political ecology. Writings and participation in editorial boards Marcelo Lopes de Souza published eleven books and more than one hundred papers and book chapters in different languages (Portuguese, English, German, Spanish, French and Turkish) covering subjects such as spatial theory, participation in urban planning, movements theory (focusing especially on the spatial dimension of urban and environmental movements), urban ‚Äòutopias‚Äô/alternative visions, urban problems, and urban political ecology. His books include, besides the ones previously mentioned, Mudar a cidade (Changing the City, 2002, 11th edition 2016) and A pris√£o e a √°gora (The Prison and the √Ågora, 2006), among others. He is one of the editors of the prestigious Brazilian urban studies journal Cidades, and is associate editor of the international journalCity (published by Routledge) as well. He belongs to the Advisory Board of the journals sub\\\\urban.zeitschrift f√ºr kritische stadtforschung (Germany; since 2012), ACME: An International Journal for Critical Geographies (UK; since 2016) and Territorios (Argentina; since 2017). He further belonged to the Advisory Board of Antipode: A Radical Journal of Geography (published by Wiley-Blackwell) between 2010 and 2104. Activism Marcelo Lopes de Souza has collaborated with urban movements organisations since the 1980s, especially with different organisations of Brazil‚Äôs movement (‚Äòroofless‚Äô workers‚Äô movement, urban counterpart to the better-known landless workers‚Äô movement) in different ways, from recherche-action' to activists in the framework of study groups and political seminars to the organisation of public events. More recently, his contributions as an activist have been mainly related to the struggle against environmental injustice in Brazilian cities.

However, neither couple is happy in their marriage. An affair is being carried on secretly within this foursome, leading to a very violent conclusion.

He notably criticized Islamism in the documentary film Frihet, likhet og Det muslimske brorskap. He was an engineer by education. Personal life and career Al-Kubaisi was born in Baghdad, Iraq where he received a degree in engineering at the University of Baghdad. He emigrated from the country to Norway as a political refugee in 1981 owing to war. He regards himself as a \\"secular Muslim\\". In addition to writing non-fiction books, he translated Arabic poetry to Norwegian: poems by Faisal Hashmi in 2008 and by Eftikhar Ismaeil in 2010.Entry for Som en forvirret i en viss tid by Faisal Hashmi in BIBSYSEntry for De f√∏rste dr√•per by Eftikhar Ismaeil in BIBSYS He was nominated to the Brage Prize in 1996.Walid al-Kubaisi Volapuk.no, retrieved 3 March 2013 He wrote the script for the 2010 film Freedom, Equality, and the Muslim Brotherhood which he directed together with Per Christian Magnus.Anne Grete Nilsen: Walid al-Kubaisi Store Norske Leksikon, retrieved 3 March 2013 Views Al-Kubaisi argued that the hijab was a political uniform for the militant Islamist movement. He maintained, that if Islamists were to be successful in making the hijab synonymous with Islam, they would have achieved a victory in the West which they had not been able to accomplish in Muslim countries. He also claimed that the hijab was only created in the 1980s after Ayatollah Khomeini's Iranian revolution, and that it, unlike national Islamic dresses such as the burqa, is a dress exclusively created for the universal political Islamist movement. He claimed that Tariq Ramadan was an Islamist, who \\"spoke with two tongues\\": smoothly and articulate in the West, yet purely Islamist in the Muslim community and the suburbs. He held that Ramadan sought to Islamize the West, but in a more patient manner than the likes of Osama bin Laden. He believed that the Muslim Brotherhood was the \\"mother organization\\" for the world's Islamist political ideology. He said that the Muslim Brotherhood had a plan to conquer Europe by the hijab, high birth rates and democracy; Islamists were exploiting Western democracy to reach their own anti-democratic goals. His 2010 documentary Frihet, likhet og det muslimske brorskap discussed this, in which he also interviewed several Arab intellectuals who espoused his views. He also claimed that notable Norwegian Muslims such as Mohammad Usman Rana, Lena Larsen and Basim Ghozlan represented the ideology of the Brotherhood in Norway, and that Abid Raja of the Norwegian Liberal Party was a \\"running boy\\" for Islamists.

Its sub-title is An Examination of the Tariff Question with Especial Regard to the Interests of Labor. As the title suggests, George examined the debate between protectionism and free trade.\\"Inadequacy of the Free Trade Argument\\", Chapter 16, Protection or Free Trade George was opposed to tariffs, which were at the time both the major method of protectionist trade policy and an important source of federal revenue. He argued that tariffs kept prices high for consumers, while failing to produce any increase in overall wages. He also believed that tariffs protected monopolistic companies from competition, thus augmenting their power. Like Progress and Poverty, much of the book was devoted to attacking privileges, such as land monopoly, which limit trade and rob value from producers. Largely as a result of this book, free trade became a major issue in federal politics. Protection or Free Trade was the first book to be read entirely into the Congressional Record. It was read aloud by five Democratic congressmen.Weir, \\"A Fragile Alliance,\\" 425‚Äì425Henry George, Protection or Free Trade: An Examination of the Tariff Question, with Especial Regard to the Interests of Labor(New York: 1887). \\"True free trade\\" George defended what he considered \\"true free trade\\". For him, this required free trade to be coupled with the treatment of land as common property: > Free trade means free production. Now fully to free production it is > necessary not only to remove all taxes on production, but also to remove all > other restrictions on production. True free trade, in short, requires that > the active factor of production, Labor, shall have free access to the > passive factor of production, Land. To secure this all monopoly of land must > be broken up, and the equal right of all to the use of the natural elements > must be secured by the treatment of the land as the common property in > usufruct of the whole people.\\"True Free Trade\\", Chapter 20, Protection or > Free Trade Acclaim In 1997, Spencer MacCallum wrote that Henry George was \\"undeniably the greatest writer and orator on free trade who ever lived.\\" In 2009, Tyler Cowen wrote that George's 1886 book Protection or Free Trade \\"remains perhaps the best-argued tract on free trade to this day.\\" Jim Powell said that Protection or Free Trade was probably the best book on trade written by anyone in the Americas, comparing it Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations. Milton Friedman said it was the most rhetorically brilliant work ever written on trade. Friedman also paraphrased one of George's arguments in favor of free trade: \\"It‚Äôs a very interesting thing that in times of war, we blockade our enemies in order to prevent them from getting goods from us. In time of peace we do to ourselves by tariffs what we do to our enemy in time of war.‚Äù Oswald Garrison Villard said, \\"Few men made more stirring and valuable contributions to the economic life of modern America than did Henry George,\\" US Representative Charles R.

As a contemporary of Charles Mitchel the two men made the Nine O'Clock News the most watched news programme on Irish television. Early life The son of a member of the Garda S√≠och√°na from Donegal, O'Doherty was born in Limerick in 1932. He was educated locally before later boarding at St. Flannan's College in Ennis. After completing his secondary schooling O'Doherty worked with the state transport provider CI√â at Foynes before joining Met √âireann in Shannon. It was here that he developed an interest in acting and he became a key member of the College Players in Limerick. In 1961 O'Doherty was transferred to Met √âireann's Central Analysis and Forecasting Office in Dublin. Broadcasting career After moving to Dublin O'Doherty applied for a position as an announcer with Radio √âireann and was accepted. He started out presenting music shows such as Hospital Requests and Today in the D√°il. During a newspaper strike in 1966 he was invited to read both radio and television news bulletins. Over the next two decades he became one of the most recognised faces and voices in Irish broadcasting. His unscripted and humorous asides that he would slip into his bulletins also became popular, much to the ire of the RT√â authorities. He also became famous for announcing the death of √âamon de Valera on RT√â on 29 August 1975. In 1983 O'Doherty announced his retirement from the state broadcaster, blaming bad working conditions. He subsequently toured the country as a comedy act before moving to Paris.

Opened in 1864, it forms part of the Pisa‚ÄìLivorno‚ÄìRome railway. The station is currently managed by Rete Ferroviaria Italiana (RFI). However, the commercial area of the passenger building is managed by Centostazioni. Train services to and from the station are operated by Trenitalia. Each of these companies is a subsidiary of Ferrovie dello Stato (FS), Italy's state-owned rail company. The Pisa‚ÄìLivorno‚ÄìRome railway is a double track main line connecting Pisa with the Tyrrhenian Sea and Rome. Grosseto railway station is roughly at its halfway point. The station is also one of the termini of a single-track non- electrified secondary line to Siena. That line continues on from Siena as the Central Tuscany railway, and later as the Leopolda railway, towards Empoli and Florence. Location Grosseto railway station is situated in Piazza Guglielmo Marconi, near the centre of the city, just north of the old town. Piazza Marconi, often erroneously referred to as Station Square, is known for its statue of a buttero (1953) by sculptor Tolomeo Faccendi. History The station was opened on 15 June 1864, upon the opening of the Follonica‚ÄìGrosseto and Grosseto‚ÄìOrbetello sections of the Pisa‚ÄìLivorno‚ÄìRome railway. Features The station complex extends laterally along the western side of the square. The passenger building was re-built after being destroyed by the bombing which occurred in Grosseto in 1943. It is made up of several buildings huddled together, on two levels. At the ground floor level, the passenger building's central facade is characterized by five portals with architraves topped by round arches. These are protected by a canopy protruding from the crease that separates the two levels of the building. At each side of the central facade are open rectangular portals. One of them leads to the bar, and the other to the waiting room. Extending across the mezzanine level of the passenger building is a series of rectangular windows, while in the central part of the main facade at that level is a square station clock, which forms a crowning feature. The station yard has five tracks with platforms for the boarding and alighting of passengers. There is also a large goods yard. Passenger and train movements View of the main platform The station has about 1.5 million passenger movements each year. Trains stopping at the station include Eurostar City Italia trains, all InterCity trains to Torino Porta Nuova, Milano Centrale, Ventimiglia, Savona, Roma Termini, Napoli Centrale, Salerno, some express trains to southern Italy and Sicily and all the regional trains operating on the Tyrrhenian line and the secondary line to Siena. Eurostar Fast trains passing through the station do not stop there. Along the line connecting Grosseto with Siena, just north of Monte Antico railway station, is a junction, with a secondary line direct to Buonconvento used by passenger and cargo trains, and another line direct to San Giovanni d'Asso and Asciano. The latter line is used only by railcars and multiple units stopping at various stations, from which excursions can be taken to nearby medieval villages and castles. Just before Siena, the two secondary lines converge once again to continue along a common path. Interchange The station is the terminus of many urban and suburban bus lines operated by Rama, the transport company serving the whole province of Grosseto.

It is at the head of the Vale of Ewyas in the Black Mountains of southeast Wales.Ordnance Survey 1:50,000 scale Landranger map sheet 161 Abergavenny & the Black Mountains Starting from Hay-on-Wye the narrow mountain road climbs steeply to a height of Ordnance Survey Map OL13 1:25,000 above sea level, squeezing between the mountains of Twmpa to the west and Hay Bluff to the east, before dropping down into the valley to the south on its way to Llanthony Priory, Llanfihangel Crucorney and Abergavenny. It is a single track road over most of its length, but there are numerous passing places. Owing to its height and exposure, it is often blocked by snow during the winter. It is well used by walkers since it gives access to the major peaks of the Black Mountains, especially at the northern end of the road, where there are several car parks. Origin of name View of Hay Bluff from the north and near the Gospel Pass The name is believed locally to derive from St Paul brought to Wales through the pass by the daughter of Caradog (or Caractacus) first preaching the gospel to her people here. According to the Community Council websitehttp://www.llanigon.org.uk/wordpress/?page_id=101 he paid a visit on that occasion to Caradog, who then lived at the Celyn, and whom he had formerly met in Rome. It is alternatively supposed to derive from the passage through here in the 12th century of Crusaders preaching and fundraising.

Walking View of the Twmpa from the Gospel Pass There is a car park near the top of the pass from the north and under Hay Bluff, and is a very convenient stopping point for exploring the nearby peaks, especially Hay Bluff and the Twmpa. The Offa's Dyke Path crosses the road near the car park, and leads to Hay Bluff before leading on to Hatterall Ridge and the Black Mountain as well as along the edge of the escarpment to the Black Hill. Although substantial efforts have been made to provide a dry stone pavement on the footpaths, especially the official Offa's Dyke path, other routes are not so well protected. Peat bogs are frequent, and the ground may be very wet underfoot on the high ground. Lower ground is often much drier, such as the lower part of the ridge running south from the Black Hill, for example. Welsh mountain ponies are frequently seen near the car park, together with the ubiquitous Welsh sheep.

Born in Calcutta, India (1970), Roy is Professor and Meyer and Renee Luskin Chair in Inequality and Democracy at the UCLA Luskin School of Public Affairs. She has been a professor of City and Regional Planning and Distinguished Chair in Global Poverty and Practice at the University of California, Berkeley. She holds a Bachelor of Comparative Urban Studies (1992) degree from Mills College, and Master of City Planning (1994) and Doctor of Philosophy (1999) degrees from the Department of City and Regional Planning at the University of California at Berkeley. Career Roy does work in three areas: # The analysis of urban poverty in the global South; # The investigation of new frontiers of capital accumulation, notably the conversion of economies of poverty into globally circulating capital; and # The examination of new formations of global urbanism, notably bold urban planning experiments undertaken by nation-states in Asia. Roy engages with feminist and ethnographic methodologies and often draws upon post-colonial feminism for theoretical inspiration. In the field of urban studies, Roy is well known for advancing the theoretical concept of \\"urban informality\\" Urban Informality, Lexington Books and the call for \\"new geographies of theory\\" that are attentive to the urban condition of the global South. She argues for a transnational approach to urbanism and urban planning, and more recently, for a transnational approach to politics and ethics In 2015 Roy was named Professor of Urban Planning and Social Welfare and Meyer and Renee Luskin Chair in Inequality and Democracy at the UCLA Luskin School of Public Affairs. She had been Professor of City and Regional Planning and Distinguished Chair in Global Poverty and Practice at the University of California at Berkeley, and, prior to that, held the Friesen Chair in Urban Studies and was a founder of the Urban Studies major at UC Berkeley. She also served as Education Director of the Blum Center for Developing Economies, where she was the founding chair of the undergraduate minor in Global Poverty and Practice at UC Berkeley. She served as co-director of the Global Metropolitan Studies Center from 2009 to 2012, and she served as Associate Dean of International and Area Studies from 2005 to 2009. At Berkeley, Roy taught graduate and undergraduate students. Her undergraduate course, \\"Global Poverty: Challenges and Hopes in the New Millennium,\\" drew 700 students each Fall at UC Berkeley. In 2006, she was awarded the Distinguished Teaching Award, the highest teaching honor UC Berkeley bestows on its faculty. Also in 2006, Roy was awarded the Distinguished Faculty Mentors award, a recognition bestowed by the Graduate Assembly of the University of California at Berkeley. In 2008, Roy was the recipient of the Golden Apple Teaching award, the only teaching award given by the student body. She was the 2009 California Professor of the Year by CASE/Carnegie Foundation. Most recently, Roy received the 2011 Excellence in Achievement Award of the California Alumni Association, a lifetime achievement recognition. Along with colleagues in the UC system, Roy has been active in the mobilizations for public education in California. Her role in such struggles was chronicled in The New Yorker in 2009. Roy herself has written about fragile solidarities of the movement under the theme, \\"We Are All Students of Color Now\\" Roy has appeared on Democracy Now! to discuss these issues, as well as her work on poverty capitalism. Work Her book, Poverty Capital: Microfinance and the Making of Development978-0-415-87673-5 Poverty Capital, Routledge is the recipient of the 2011 Paul Davidoff Book Award of the Association of Collegiate Schools of Planning. The primary book award in urban planning, the Davidoff prize \\"recognizes an outstanding book publication promoting participatory planning and positive social change, opposing poverty and racism as factors in society and seeking ways to reduce disparities between rich and poor; white and black; men and women.\\" Paul Davidoff Book Awards Roy has argued that microfinance is an instrument of financial inclusion, a part of the \\"democratization of capital,\\" but also that it is potentially a new global subprime market, one in which debt is securitized and traded In a recent special issue of Public Culture, which she guest-edited, Roy highlights the making of poverty capitalism and markets in humanitarian goods Her work contrasts such approaches with poverty interventions that are concerned with social protection and the transformation of inequality. In 2014, Roy, in conjunction with the Blum Center for Developing Economies and the UCLA Luskin Institute for Inequality and Democracy developed the #GlobalPOV project. The project uses digital and social media to expand the conversation about global poverty beyond the confinements of academia. Rather than provide solutions to global poverty, it encourages people to reflect and critically engage with their relationship to spatially distant poverty as well as poverty that exists within the context of one‚Äôs everyday life. Videos narrated by Roy, Khalid Kadir (UC Berkeley lecturer), Genevieve Negr√≥n- Gonzales (University of San Francisco professor), and Clare Talwalker (UC Berkeley lecturer) are uploaded to YouTube, and conversations are encouraged over twitter via the hashtag, #GlobalPOV. Since the inauguration of President Trump in 2016, Roy has published several articles about the need for planners to be politically engaged. Together with the UCLA Abolitionist Planning Group, Roy created a resource guide titled ‚ÄúAbolitionist Planning for Resistance‚Äù that frames key issues around which to mobilize political action such as civil liberties, policing, housing rights, union labor, sanctuary cities, and environmental justice.Abbot, Thomas, et al. ‚ÄúAbolitionist Planning.‚Äù Https://Challengeinequality.luskin.ucla.edu/2018/04/06/Abolitionist-Planning- for-Resistance/, UCLA Luskin Institute on Inequality and Democracy, 2017, challengeinequality.luskin.ucla.edu/wp- content/uploads/sites/16/2017/05/AboPlan_Pub_FINAL_online-v2-1.pdf. In her article ‚ÄúThe Infrastructure of Assent: Professions in the Age of Trumpism,‚Äù Roy criticizes the eagerness of built environment professions, specifically architecture, planning and international development, to uncritically align themselves with racist governments, institutions, figures of power in exchange for recognition and profit. She argues that students, educators, and professionals must reject a culture of complicity and develop one of ‚Äúdisobedience, refusal and resistance.‚Äù Authored Books * 2010.

It was formerly known as Sotra Facula; the current name was approved on 19 December 2012. It is a possible cryovolcanic caldera across and deep, and is immediately to the east of the largest putative cryovolcanic mountain on Titan, the high Doom Mons. Sotra Patera is the deepest known pit on Titan. The ice volcano or cryovolcano Doom Mons forms a roughly circular mountain measuring about across. It has two peaks standing about and high with multiple craters, with Sotra Patera at being the deepest. Finger-like flows are visible on the flanks of the mountain, measuring perhaps thick.\\"Cassini Spots Potential Ice Volcano on Saturn Moon\\". NASA, December 14, 2010 Global view of Titan showing the location of Sotra Patera The Cassini‚ÄìHuygens mission has mapped Sotra Patera using the Cassini orbiter's onboard radar instrument and the visual and infrared mapping spectrometer. An earlier survey of the region in 2004 revealed a circular bright spot, or facula, which was nicknamed \\"The Rose\\". A subsequent flyby by Cassini re-surveyed the region from a different angle, enabling members of the US Geological Survey Astrogeology Science Center to generate stereoscopic mapping of Sotra Patera and the surrounding area. Researchers also discovered at least two more mountains and another big crater, forming a chain of mountains several hundred kilometers long flanked by lava-covered lowlands. With Doom Mons, Sotra Patera is regarded as \\"the very best evidence, by far, for volcanic topography anywhere documented on an icy satellite\\", according to planetary scientist Jeffrey Kargel of the University of Arizona. It has been compared with terrestrial volcanoes such as Etna, Laki and volcanic cones near Flagstaff, Arizona. There is as yet no evidence of current activity, but researchers plan to monitor the area for changes. It is unclear what might have been erupted from Sotra Patera‚Äîpossibly water mixed with ammonium, or more exotic hydrocarbon compounds such as polyethylene, paraffin waxes or asphalt.Castelvecchi, Davide. \\"Titan Spews: Discovery of Cold Volcanoes on Saturnian Moon May Solve Methane Mystery\\". Scientific American, December 16, 2010 The eruptions may also have brought methane to the surface. Titan's dense methane atmosphere is constantly being broken down by sunlight in the upper atmosphere through photolysis; cryovolcanism may therefore explain how the atmosphere is being replenished. The eruptions of Sotra Patera are presumed to originate in a layer of liquid water lying below Titan's icy crust. The mountain's heavily cratered appearance indicates that it must have erupted with considerable force, but the precise mechanism by which this happened is not certain. Liquid water is ordinarily denser than ice but it is possible that the water's density may be reduced by mixing with other substances, such as ammonia, allowing it to force its way to the surface. Alternatively, some other mechanism such as the underground formation of methane bubbles or a build-up of tectonic pressure may be responsible.

As Chief Ringside Physician for Professional Boxing and Mixed Martial Arts, he was responsible for creating many of the medical protocols utilized in boxing. He founded the first Medical Association for Professional Ringside Physicians. Biography Schwartz was appointed a ringside physician for the State of Connecticut in 1991 and was named to the Medical Advisory Board in 1995. Two years later, he was named Chief Ringside Physician for the State of Connecticut. Schwartz also serves as the Chief Ringside Physician and Chairman of the Medical Advisory Board for both Foxwoods Resort Casino and Mohegan Sun Casino in Connecticut. In 1997, Schwartz established the American Association of Professional Ringside Physicians (AAPRP) a medical organization created to establish medical protocols for boxing and mixed martial arts worldwide. He served as Chairman of the Medical Advisory Board for the World Boxing Union and is a member of the Medical Advisory Board for the Association of Boxing Commissions (ABC) and the American Association for the Improvement of Boxing (AAIB). In 2000, after the passage of the Muhammad Ali Boxing Reform Act, he testified on boxing safety at the National Association of Attorneys General Boxing Task Force (NAAG) hearings in New York City and in 2001 for the New York State Assembly on Boxing Reform.

Additionally, the act would have established a three-member U.S. Boxing Commission within the Department of Commerce. On November 17, 2005 the House voted it down. A similar bill, however, passed the Senate by unanimous consent on May 10, 2005. Following the defeat of this bill, Schwartz met with Senator John McCain and Congressman Peter King to introduce the Professional Boxing Amendments Act of 2009. This bill would have required the presence of an ambulance and emergency medical personnel during a match and prohibit arranging or fighting a match unless it's approved by the United States Boxing Commission and held in a state that regulates matches in accordance with USBC standards. It would also have required a health and safety disclosure to boxers, require the USBC to establish and maintain a registry of comprehensive medical records, medical denials and suspensions for every licensed boxer and establish a national computerized registry of boxing personnel. The legislation was never voted upon, but was scheduled to be re-introduced in 2011.\\"AAPRP Board of Directors Meet with Senator John McCain\\" from EastSideBoxing.com; accessed October 24, 2014.

The ship's guests, led by Bernard d'Andr√®zy, try to weed out the thief with only a partial description of his appearance and the first letter of the alias he is using.

Cahorn seeks out detective Ganimard, who happens to be on vacation in town, and hires him and two of his men to guard the belongings on the announced date. When the crime occurs, Ganimard asks Cahorn not to tell people he was there and an official investigation is launched, during which Ganimard is called in as the expert on the thief. Ganimard goes to see Lupin in prison, where the thief explains it was he who was hired to watch the night of the crime. Lupin also states that he was only arrested because he was distracted by a woman he loved and declares that he will not be present at his own trial. * \\"The Escape of Ars√®ne Lupin\\" (\\"L'√âvasion d'Ars√®ne Lupin\\") Je sais tout, No. 12, 15 January 1906, as \\"The Extraordinary Life of Ars√®ne Lupin: The Escape of Arsene Lupin\\") :Having learned that Ars√®ne Lupin plans to escape before his trial, the police allow it to happen while secretly watching him in order to arrest his accomplices. However, after a meal, Lupin simply returns to prison, having known he was being tailed already. During the trial Ganimard is convinced that the charged man is not Lupin, but a lookalike. The lookalike had been arrested and released on the same day that Lupin willingly returned to prison. When the lookalike is released, Ganimard tails him only to confront him and realize it was Lupin all along. The thief reveals he made himself look like an imposter through dieting and certain drug injections, and that his colleagues had the actual lookalike arrested that day on purpose. * \\"The Mysterious Traveller\\" (\\"Le Myst√©rieux voyageur\\") Je sais tout, No. 13, 15 February 1906, as \\"The Extraordinary Life of Arsene Lupin: The Mysterious Traveler\\") : * \\"The Queen's Necklace\\" (\\"Le Collier de la reine\\") Je sais tout, No. 15, 15 April 1906, as \\"The Extraordinary Life of Arsene Lupin: The Queen's Necklace\\") * \\"The Safe of Madame Imbert\\" (\\"Le Coffre-fort de madame Imbert\\") Je sais tout, No. 16, 15 May 1906, as \\"The Extraordinary Life of Arsene Lupin: The Safe of Madame Imbert\\") * \\"Sherlock Holmes Arrives Too Late\\" (\\"Sherlock Holm√®s arrive trop tard\\") Je sais tout, No. 17, 15 June 1906, as \\"The Extraordinary Life of Arsene Lupin: Sherlock Holmes Arrives Too Late\\")Between the publication of the story in the magazine and its subsequent publication in the collection, Sherlock Holmes became Herlock Sholm√®s, following a protest by Arthur Conan Doyle. * \\"The Black Pearl\\" (\\"La Perle noire\\") Je sais tout, No. 18, 15 July 1906, as \\"The Extraordinary Life of Arsene Lupin: The Black Pearl\\") * \\"Seven of Hearts\\" (\\"Le Sept de c≈ìur\\") Je sais tout, No. 28, 15 May 1907, as \\"How I Met Arsene Lupin: The Seven of Hearts\\") Notes External links Ars√®ne Lupin, Gentleman Burglar on Project Gutenberg Ars√®ne Lupin, Gentleman Burglar, audio version 20px French short story collections Ars√®ne Lupin novels 1907 short story collections Works originally published in Je sais tout ","title":"Ars√®ne Lupin, Gentleman Burglar"},{"id":"30111752","text":"Herv√© Ndonga Mianga (born 2 May 1992) is a Democratic Republic of the Congolese footballer, who currently plays for TP Mazembe as a midfielder.

The Helvetia Mine quickly became one of the largest producers in the region, dominating the Reynoldsville coalfield for many years. The company town lasted from 1891‚Äì1947. Schools, churches, stores were built for the families of the miners and to this day a small population still live in Helvetia. It had three periods of ownership; Adrian Iselin built the town and started commercial operations at the mine around 1890‚Äì1891; during the second period of ownership, from 1896 to 1947, management and operations at Helvetia were under the direct control of the R&P; in 1947, the R&P; sold all of its company towns, including Helvetia, to the Kovalchick Salvage Company. The mine was permanently closed in 1954. Helvetia is an ancient name for Switzerland. Early Helvetia What drew investors to this portion of Brady Township was a vast, six-foot coal seam lying just beneath the surface of cultivated fields and timber stands. Lands and mineral rights in this portion of Brady Township- some 7,000 to 8,000 acres- were secretly purchased and consolidated in the late 1880s and early 1890s by Adrian Iselin, a New York investment banker. The Helvetia Mine was owned exclusively by Iselin and operated independently of the R&P; until 1896, when it was joined to other R&P; holdings. Thus it was Adrian Iselin who first put his stamp on the company town, not the R&P.; After Helvetia opened, Iselin and the R&P; seem to have acted cooperatively in a number of matters regarding wages, transportation rates, and mining and coking operations at Helvetia between 1891 and 1896. The mine was serviced via the Mahoning Valley Railroad, a one-and-three-quarter-mile-long spur built by Adrian Iselin to connect with the BR&P; rail network at Stanley. The R&P; often used the BR&P; line to run special cars for company officials traveling to Helvetia, but it is not likely that the BR&P; transported miners, except for newly recruited hands who were conveyed to the mine by rail from cities on the eastern seaboard. Travel to Helvetia was difficult for the common miner until first Stanley then Helvetia were linked to the streetcar system connecting DuBois and Sykesville around 1906. The advent of the motorcar made little difference to Helvetia families until the 1920s, when automobiles became more affordable. Helvetia's residents, then, were largely dependent on their employees for services during the mine's earliest years of operations. The surviving Helvetia ledger, local tax records, and several pieces of correspondence make it clear that Adrian Iselin began construction of the coal plant, offices, worker housing, the company store, and other town facilities in late 1890. Iselin was eager to begin production, and his correspondence shows that the mine was operating by early 1891, while tonnage records indicate the mine was producing well by 1892. Construction of the power plant began in March 1891 and the town waterworks in September of that year. By 1892, the industrial plant for the mine had grown considerably to include a blacksmith shop, a general office building, a steam saw and shingle mill, the powerhouse and its related machinery, and the tipple. A weigh office and scale were added in 1895. Coke ovens were apparently built as part of the coal plant in 1892, though no mention of the ovens can be found in the tax records until 1895 when the assessor noted that 28 ovens were located on site. The local DuBois paper stated, however, that construction was scheduled to begin in the late spring or summer of 1892. In June of that same year, the newspaper noted that work on the coke ovens was progressing and that \\"Helvetia will soon be sending her light heavenward to mark her location as well as her sister mining towns.\\" Iselin did not neglect provisions for his employees, as the coal mining operation got under way at Helvetia. Construction of the company town seems to have begun almost immediately. Iselin's ledger book shows rental income for the first time on February 28, 1891, for a modest $52.07 for the month, while Helvetia Supply Co. stocks sale reached $351.64 for the same period. Indeed, records indicate that the bulk of Helvetia's housing and many of the town's facilities were built between 1890‚Äì1896 under Iselin's direction. Sixty-two miners' double houses and 10 single houses, or 134 total units, were built for the company town under Iselin's tenure, beginning in November 1890. Assessment records show that 41 double-block houses and 10 single houses were complete by May 1892. Listed separately from all of these structures in 1892 and in subsequent tax rolls are two dwelling houses, one for the engineer and one for the superintendent of the mine. Finally, Iselin's correspondence indicates that a brick house, known as the Haskal Mansion, was built for the manager of the mines. Fifteen new double houses were assessed in 1893, bringing the number of miner's dwellings to 56. Notes  References  All relevant terms must be followed.

His first appearances were at small theatres in Belgium and northern France beginning in 1845. In 1847, he arrived at the Th√©√¢tre Montmartre in Paris where he met Herv√©. He asked Herv√© to provide him with a musical sketch (drawn from Cervantes' novel Don Quixote), in which the tall and thin Herv√© as the Don was pitted against the short and plump D√©sir√© as Sancho Pan√ßa. The sketch inspired what was later dubbed the first French operetta, Herv√©'s Don Quichotte et Sancho Pan√ßa, which premiered in 1848 at Adolphe Adam's Th√©√¢tre National at the Cirque Olympique, but with Joseph Kelm, instead of D√©sir√©, as Sancho Pan√ßa.Traubner, Richard.

In subsequent years D√©sir√© appeared in operetta theatres in Lille, Brussels, and Marseille. He also became a star at Herv√©‚Äôs Parisian Folies-Concertantes (later the Folies-Nouvelles). Finally he was engaged by Jacques Offenbach for the Th√©√¢tre des Bouffes-Parisiens, where D√©sir√© made his brilliantly successful debut on 16 May 1857 in Vent-du-Soir, ou l'horrible festin. Thereafter until 1873 he remained one of the star actors of Offenbach's company, appearing in many of the premieres of Offenbach's most famous operettas. His greatest success was his unforgettable portrayal of the role of Jupiter in Orpheus in the Underworld, which premiered on 21 October 1858. D√©sir√© also appeared at other Parisian theatres, including the Th√©√¢tre des Vari√©t√©s, the Th√©√¢tre du Palais-Royal, and the Ath√©n√©e-Musicale, and also worked with the French operetta composer Charles Lecocq.

Johnson, who is a lover of folk music, especially Irish and Breton and is reasonably knowledgeable on the subject. Originally from Belfast, he lived for many years in Dublin where he owned and ran Shay Beano, a French restaurant. Since then he has participated in some Irish daytime television programmes, such as 'The Afternoon Show', conducting cookery demonstrations on Raidi√≥ Teilif√≠s √âireann (RT√â). One then-regular item, called \\"Meal or no Meal\\", is a spoof on Noel Edmonds's Deal or no Deal. √ì Cath√°in picked five numbered red boxes from a mystery choice of 15. Each box contained one ingredient, and when all five are chosen, the challenge is set for him to come up with either a meal or no meal, by the end of the show. But he was much better-known for his programmes on TG4, among them 'Nua Gach Bia', 'Bia's B√≥thar' and 'C√≥sta U√≠ Chath√°in'. Bia's B√≥thar, for example was a travelogue initially of Ireland and then Europe, presented entirely in Irish with English subtitles where he cooks a meal, often outdoors, from local ingredients. It ran for five series from 2001 to 2005. The final series visited many of the accession countries then joining the EU. He also broadcast a radio show on world music on RT√â Raidi√≥ na Gaeltachta. It was called Thar T√≠r Isteach and went out on Friday nights, concentrating on music from Russia, Poland, Portugal, Africa, Brazil and various other ‚Äúnew Irish‚Äù communities now resident in recently multicultural Ireland. Prior to that, there were long- running series on RT√â Radio One such as 'Wide World Music' as well as a classical series in Irish, 'Cartlann U√≠ Chath√°in' on RT√â Lyric FM. For the most part radio shows were confined to √âamonn's love of music with the exception of 'Love Bites' for RT√â and 'The Global Gourmet' for the BBC. He is very interested in languages, speaking Irish, English, French fluently with smatterings of Italian, Spanish, Arabic, Portuguese and Welsh. His three books to date are The Irish Folk Music Guide (1981), Around Ireland With a Pan - Food, Tales and Recipes (2004) and The Hard Times Cook Book (2009). He is not currently writing a tome on technology but is a frequent Tweeter (https://twitter.com/culabula) and Facebooker. At one time he had 29 mobile phones in an attempt to thwart exorbitant roaming charges in Europe, though the need for that any more has been largely negated by the advent of iPhone and the suppression of roaming charges. Instead he has a ToggleMobile SIM with nine numbers on it and a data SIM which he can use anywhere. A big fan of travelling by train, these days he will more often walk as far as his legs will take him, weather permitting. He lives alone in 'The Hovel' surrounded by thousands of LPs, singles and unloved Compact Discs.

Responsible for the regions of Macedonia and Thrace, since 2015 it has been demoted to the level of a sub-ministry within the Ministry of the Interior. The incumbent Deputy Minister for Macedonia and Thrace is of New Democracy. The ministry had been known as the Ministry of Northern Greece until it was renamed on 19 August 1988. It was demoted to a general secretariat in 2009, but was re-established as a ministry in 2012, and again demoted to a sub- ministry within the Ministry of the Interior on 27 January 2015. It is housed in Government House in the capital of Macedonia, Thessaloniki. History The ministry was founded in 1912 as the Governorate-General of Macedonia () following the acquisition of Macedonia during the Balkan Wars. It was promoted to cabinet level in the late 1920s and renamed the Governorate-General of Northern Greece () in 1945, after being merged with the Governorate-General of Thrace (). It was renamed the Ministry of Northern Greece () in 1955. The third name change occurred in 1988, when it was renamed the Ministry of Macedonia and Thrace.Government Gazette (Greece) (Œ¶EK)B 575 - 19.08.1988 In 2009, the ministry was downgraded to a General Secretariat within the Ministry of the Interior, until it was re-established as a separate ministry in 2012. With the legislative election of SYRIZA in January 2015, the ministry was once more subordinated to the Ministry of the Interior and Administrative Reconstruction, headed by a deputy minister. Shortly after the Hellenic Army entered Thessaloniki on 26 October 1912, King Constantine I demanded that he be given control of the newly acquired region of Macedonia, but Prime Minister Eleutherios Venizelos had already decided that the fate of the region would lie with his Minister of Justice, Konstantinos Raktivan, who arrived in the city on 30 October. His position within the Governorate-General of Macedonia was so powerful that his power matched that of the Prime Minister and caused dismay among the other ministers in Athens. Raktivan was later succeeded by other prominent politicians of Greece, such as Stefanos Dragoumis, Emmanouil Repoulis and Themistoklis Sofoulis. Despite its limited freedom of action in later years, the Governorate-General of Macedonia managed to produce an astonishing amount of work between its founding in 1912 and the creation of the Ministry of Northern Greece in 1955. Following the Great Thessaloniki Fire of 1917, the Governorate-General appointed Ernest H√©brard as the master architect for the redesign of the city. The Governorate-General was also responsible for the complete incorporation of Macedonia into the Greek state despite the difficult circumstances of the interwar period. Other successes of the Governorate-General at the time include the establishment of numerous government agencies, including the creation of Courts of Appeal, Courts of First Instance and District Courts, the creation of an independent archaeological department, a forestry department and public services, and the provision of shelter to hundreds of thousands of refugees after the population exchange between Greece and Turkey in the 1920s. The Ministry Structure According to Presidential Decree no. 167 (2 September 2005),http://www.mathra.gr/files/YMATH_Organismos.pdf the Ministry of Macedonia and Thrace was made up of the following departments: *The Ministry of Macedonia and Thrace **The Office of Solicitor of the State **The Office of Financial Control **The Office of the Borderland **The Office of the Assessor of the Audit Office **The Office of the Deputy Minister ***The Office of Defence and Political Planning in Case of Emergency ***The Office of Public Relations, of the Press and of Etiquette **The Office of the Secretary-General ***The Secretariat ****The Office of Foreign Affairs, Defence, Policing and Justice ::::*Department of Cooperation with the countries of south-eastern Europe ::::*Department of European Affairs ::::*Department of the Diaspora ::::*Department of Defence and the Aegean ::::*Department of Policing and Justice :::*The Office of Education, Culture and Citizen Protection :::*The Office of the Economy and Tourism :::*The Office of Infrastructure and the Environment :::*The Office of Administrative Development and e-Governance :::*The Office of the Media :::*The Office of Quality and Efficiency :::*The Office of Facilitation of People with Disabilities ::*The Department of Inspection and Coordination of Services Political leadership Since the Metapolitefsi, there have been twenty Ministers for Macedonia and Thrace from two parties, New Democracy and PASOK.

The term is a contraction of \\"now\\" and \\"forecasting\\" and originates in meteorology. It has recently become popular in economics as typical measures used to assess the state of an economy (e.g., gross domestic product (GDP)), are only determined after a long delay and are subject to revision. Nowcasting models have been applied most notably in Central Banks, who use the estimates to monitor the state of the economy in real-time as a proxy for official measures.  Principle  While weather forecasters know weather conditions today and only have to predict future weather, economists have to forecast the present and even the recent past. Many official measures are not timely due to the difficulty in collecting information. Historically, nowcasting techniques have been based on simplified heuristic approaches but now rely on complex econometric techniques. Using these statistical models to produce predictions eliminates the need for informal judgement. Nowcast models can exploit information from a large quantity of data series at different frequencies and with different publication lags. Signals about the direction of change in GDP can be extracted from this large and heterogeneous set of information sources (such as jobless figures, industrial orders, trade balances) before the official estimate of GDP is published. In nowcasting, this data is used to compute sequences of current quarter GDP estimates in relation to the real time flow of data releases. Development Selected academic research papers show how this technique has developed. Banbura, Giannone and Reichlin (2011) and Marta Banbura, Domenico Giannone, Michele Modugno & Lucrezia Reichlin (2013) provide surveys of the basic methods and more recent refinements. Nowcasting methods based on social media content (such as Twitter) have been developed to estimate hidden sentiment such as the 'mood' of a population or the presence of a flu epidemic. A simple-to-implement, regression-based approach to nowcasting involves mixed-data sampling or MIDAS regressions. Nowcasting can additionally be combined with econometric models to improve overall forecast accuracy and reduce errors. Such models can be built using bayesian vector autoregressions, dynamic factors, bridge equations using time series methods, or some combination with other methods. The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta publishes a publically-available nowcast for U.S. GDP called GDPNow. Similarly, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York publishes a dynamic factor model nowcast. Neither are official forecasts of the Federal Reserve regional bank, system, or the FOMC; nor do they incorporate human judgment.

He was also an accomplished mandolinist, playing the mandolin as a \\"Top Grade\\" player for the Indian film industry in Mumbai for more than five decades, reputed to have played more than 22,000 songs, including title-songs and background music. Besides the music for movies, he was known to play Indian classical music (Hindustani), as well as Arabic music and Sufi music.  Biography  Sajjad Hussain was born in 1917 in Sitamau, which was at that time, a village in the then Central India Agency, now called Madhya Pradesh, India . As a child, he was taught sitar by his father Mohammed Amir Khan. He learned veena, violin, flute and piano during his teenager years. He was also an accomplished mandolin player, and could play Indian classical music on the instrument. In 1937, Sajjad Hussain decided to try his luck as a film score composer, and came to Bombay with his elder brother Nisar Hussain. His first job was at Sohrab Modi's Minerva Movietone at Rs. 30 a month. He later moved to the Wadia Movietone, working at Rs. 60 a month. During the next few years, he worked as an assistant to music composer Meer Saheb and Rafiq Ghaznavi, and as a contract instrument player for Shaukat Hussain Rizvi. In 1940, Sajjad was introduced to the composer Mir Allah Baksh (father of actress Meena Kumari) by a friend. Impressed with Sajjad's mandolin skills, Ali employed him as an assistant. Sometime later, Sajjad became an assistant to the music director Hanuman Prasad. In this capacity, he composed two songs for the film Gaali (1944): Aag Lage Saavan Mein and Ab Aaja Dil Na Lage (both sung by Nirmala Devi). The songs of Dost (1944), his first film as an independent music director, were big hits. These songs included the three songs sung by Noor Jehan: Koi Prem Ka Deke Sandesa, Alam Par Alam Aur Sitam Par Sitam and Badnaam Mohabbat Kaun Kare. But when the film producer Shaukat Hussain Rizvi gave the entire credit to his wife Noor Jehan for the success of the songs, Sajjad Hussain vowed never to work with Noor Jehan again. Sajjad went on to work with many notable singers, including Suraiyya, Lata Mangeshkar and Asha Bhosle. He was regarded highly by his contemporaries, including Anil Biswas. One of the best scores that Sajjad Hussain created was in the film Rustam Sohrab (1963) in which Suraiyya sang 'Ye kaisi ajab dastan ho gayi hai'. Lata Mangeshkar's one of the most favourite songs 'Ae dilruba' and 'Phir tumhari yaad aayi ae sanam' by Mohammed Rafi, Talat Mahmood and Manna Dey were appreciated. In a 2012 interview, Lata Mangeshkar named him as her favourite composer. His music compositions rank among the most complex scores of Hindi film songs. Contentious personality Sajjad Hussain was known for his contentious personality. He often landed in controversies due to his short temper, outspokenness, moody behaviour and perfectionist nature. When Shaukat Hussain Rizvi gave the credit for the musical success of Dost (1944) to his wife and singer Noor Jehan, Sajjad vowed never to compose a song for Noor Jehan. He had conflicts with the lyricist D. N. Madhok during recording of film Saiyyan (1951), and with actor Dilip Kumar during the recording of film Sangdil (1952). He made disapproving remarks on Lata Mangeshkar's singing, leading to differences between the two for a short period. He called Talat Mahmood \\"Galat Mehmood\\" (Wrong Mehmood) and Kishore Kumar \\"Shor Kumar\\" (Noisy Kumar), and also criticised Naushad's music. He rejected an offer by Shashadhar Mukherjee of Filmistan, and lost the opportunity to compose music for film Mughal-e-Azam (1960) due to differences with film producer-director K. Asif. Once, heavily impressed by Sajjad Hussain's Yeh hawa yeh raat yeh chandni (film Sangdil), the composer Madan Mohan created Tujhe kya sunaun mein dilruba, tere saamne mera haal hai (film: Aakhri Dao) on the same metre. At a concert when Madan Mohan walked past Sajjad, the hot-tempered Sajjad taunted \\"Aaj kal toh parchaiyyan bhi ghoomne phirne lagi hai\\" (\\"Even shadows are moving around now\\"). Madan Mohan replied that he could not find any better music director to copy. This reply made Sajjad Hussain speechless. Hindi film expert Rajesh Subramanian explains that such comments made him an avoidable character and people from the industry started ignoring him. As a result of his controversial behaviour, Sajjad got less than 20 film score assignments in his 34-year-long music career. However, one notable milestone in his career as music director is the songs he composed for Sri Lankan Sinhala film \\"Daiwa yogaya-1959\\". Daiwa Yogaya was filmed in Prasad Studios in Pune and was a box office hit in Sri Lanka mainly owing to the songs he composed. The songs \\"Hada Gile Ama Mihire\\" and \\"Doi Doiya putha\\" sung by Rukmani Devi, the most popular Actress/Singer of Ceylon in that era are still popular. His last film as a composer was Aakhri Sajda (1977), although he participated in concerts till the 1980s. Lata Mangeshkar was once asked in an interview about music directors that she had found difficult to please. She replied that in the beginning of her career, there were difficulties with everyone because she was still learning and was new in the field. But she was always apprehensive with Sajjad Hussain because he was so particular. Sajjad Hussain never liked loud singing. He always insisted that all the musical instruments were perfectly tuned. He never compromised on that. She added that even many years after the first recording, Sajjad Hussain's songs sound effortless and are not painful to hear. Death and legacy Sajjad Hussain lived in the Natalwala Building at Mahim, Mumbai, India in the last years of his life. He had five sons and one daughter. All five of his sons (Mustafa, Yusuf, Noor Mohammad, Nasir Ahmmad and Abdul Karim) went on to become musicians. Sajjad Hussain died on 21 July 1995 in oblivion: Khayyam and Pankaj Udhas were the only notable film personalities to attend his funeral. It is a widely-considered view of Sajjad Hussain in India that this music maestro, though had a bad temper and was a perfectionist, had a profound understanding of film song lyrics, instrumentation, classical music and the voice quality of his singers. He had learned and mastered these instruments - violin, veena, jaltarang, flute, piano, banjo, accordion, Hawaiin and Spanish guitar, sitar, clarinet, harp and mandolin. For one person to learn and master all these instruments is saying a lot for that individual. Veteran music director Naushad is quoted as saying, \\"He (Sajjad Hussain) was an extremely talented man, very knowledgeable about music, but his temperament was his undoing.\\" Another highly-respected music director Anil Biswas once observed, \\"By all standards Sajjad Hussain was an original, a genius music director, different from all others and each of his musical composition carried most difficult notations, which he himself used to create and took utmost pleasure out of it.\\"  Filmography  * Gaali (1944) * Dost (1944) * Dharam (1945) * 1857 (1946) * Tilasmi Duniya (1946) * Kasam (1947) * Mere Bhagwan (1947) * Rooplekha (1949) * Khel (1950) * Magroor (1950) * Hulchul (1951) * Saiyyan (1951) * Sangdil (1952) * Rukhsana (1955) * Rustam Sohrab (1963) * Mera Shikaar (1973) * Aakhri Sajda (1977) A nearly 15-minute mandolin composition by Sajjad was used in the Telugu movie Muthyala Muggu.

It was released for one of the five games included in the second Humble Indie Bundle in 2010. As a result of the success of the Humble Indie Bundle sale the source code of Revenge of the Titans was released. On March 16, 2011, the game was released on Steam. The game received positive reviews from critics, who commended its art style, gameplay, and writing. Gameplay left Revenge of the Titans plays like a traditional tower defense game but with the caveat that enemies ignore or attempt to avoid the towers that you place, increasing the difficulty. The goal for each level is to prevent the command center from being destroyed by aliens by protecting it with turrets and other defenses. The player has access to extensive research trees that they can use to develop different types of defenses against enemies. In addition to the normal alien enemies, there are also large alien bosses that present a greater challenge and force the player to change strategies. The game is created in a style that combines retro pixel art with modern aesthetics.  Plot  Revenge of the Titans is a direct sequel to Titan Attacks!. After successfully stopping an alien race from the moon Titan from destroying Earth via their spacecraft, the aliens return for revenge, launching an all-out ground invasion. The player is the unseen commander of a military force that must stop the new invasion and then deal with the alien threat once and for all, by decimating them on Titan itself. Development The game was initially slated to be released on PS3, PS4 and Vita by Curve Studios, but porting the game was deemed too difficult, and only Titan Attacks! was ported to consoles.  Music  The soundtrack of Revenge of the Titans consists of six tracks. Each is a synthesized version of a classical music piece. # March - Music for the Funeral of Queen Mary # Fanfare ‚Äì Fanfare for the Common Man # Mars ‚Äì Mars, the Bringer of War # Einleitung - initial fanfare from Also sprach Zarathustra (Strauss) # Toccata - Toccata in D minor (Johann Sebastian Bach) # Fugue - Fugue in D minor (Johann Sebastian Bach) Reception Revenge of the Titans received positive reviews from critics, and has an aggregate review score of 79/100 on Metacritic. Emanuel Maiberg of GamePro scored the game 90/100, calling it a \\"nearly perfect game\\" with \\"ingenious\\" art direction and \\"stellar\\" writing, while also commending the game's high level of difficulty. Alec Meer of Eurogamer praised the blend of RTS and tower defense genres in Titans, awarding it 8 out of 10. Nick Kolan of IGN scored the game 70/100, commending the game's depth and cleverness, but criticizing the \\"sharp difficulty curve\\" and \\"poor upgrade system\\", which he claimed would limit the game's \\"mass appeal\\".

Synopsis Molly is a freelance photographer and journalist who has just been offered an assignment by The New York Times: travel to Cambodia to cover a U.S. military search for the body of an American pilot who went down thirty years ago during the Vietnam War. She meets up with the search team and encounters two civilians. One is Duncan O'Brian, a kindly academic and archaeologist who is interested in restoring ancient Khmer temples. The other is John Kleat, the brother of an MIA Vietnam veteran who has dedicated his life to finding the remains of missing American soldiers in Vietnam and Cambodia. There is also a mysterious blond Caucasian man, thin and bedraggled, who is seen from a distance but never approaches the team. After weeks of work the remains of the pilot, or any U.S. servicemen, have still not been discovered. A typhoon is approaching and the search is to be cancelled. At the last moment, Molly randomly begins taking shots with her digital camera, including a shot down a large sinkhole. When she reviews the photo it turns out that the bottom of the sinkhole contains human bones. A search by a Marine lowered on a rope reveals evidence of an American pilot, as well as a Khmer Rouge mass grave. The U.S. military is contacted and agrees to extend the search by a week, but for essential personnel only - meaning that Molly, Duncan, and Kleat are expelled from the dig. In a Phnom Penh restaurant, Kleat fumes angrily that Molly got them kicked off the dig by taking pictures of human remains, something she had been told not to do by the U.S. military. Hours before all three civilians are to depart to return to their respective homes, the mysterious blond man from the dig site approaches, revealing that he has found dog tags of several MIA servicemen, all of the Eleventh Cavalry armor. He reveals that his name is Luke and he speaks with a West Texas accent, and the trio place his age at about twenty. He gives them two hours to decide whether or not to join him ‚Äì if they agree he will lead them to the resting places of these missing soldiers. Molly, Duncan, and Kleat agree.

Knowing that the APCs went into the rain forest and up the mountainside, the group continues in that direction. They soon find an undiscovered ancient Khmer city of massive size, and Luke disappears. The group makes camp, amazed at their find and deciding that remains of the missing group of Eleventh Cavalry soldiers must be inside. As everyone begins to explore the city, they discover both amazing and troubling things. The ancient city, while remaining unpillaged and unvandalized over hundreds of years, is a labyrinth that has been further confused by the overgrown jungle. Quickly, signs of the missing soldiers are discovered, and appear strange: The soldiers, of which there are nine listed as missing, had tried to turn parts of the city into a crude fortress, stringing concertina wire. One morning, during an argument, the group looks up to discover one of the soldiers' two APCs some sixty feet up in a grove of enormous trees - the forest having grown that much in thirty years. Molly, a veteran rock-climber, climbs up to the armored vehicle and attaches a rope. She discovers a terra- cotta head, having been taken from one of the many statues in the city, mounted to the vehicle's exhaust port as a trophy. The group begins descending into argument, dissension, and anger as the days pass. Duncan and Molly want to explore the city and catalog its sites, later to release the findings to the academic world for further exploration. Kleat is only interested in the remains of the soldiers, and is willing to allow the three Cambodian brothers to loot and pillage to keep them satisfied. Samnang sides with Molly and Duncan, but is hated by the three brothers, and is disdained by Kleat, because there is evidence that he was once a member of the Khmer Rouge government. The three brothers, armed with assault rifles, begin growing more aggressive and hostile over time. Molly tricked Kleat into giving her his Glock pistol to prevent him from provoking a slaughter, and hid it away. Finally, the remains of the Eleventh Cav soldiers are found. Some are found in the top room of a large tower. The room was once a shrine to Buddha, with an open roof to serve as an observatory. The soldiers had turned the room into a defensible bunker and had created a large S.O.S. signal on the floor of the room, hoping that aircraft would pass overhead and see it. The room shows evidence of a massive firefight, but no non-American ammunition is found - there is no sign of an enemy. That night Molly is awakened to the sound of gunfire ‚Äì the three brothers are intoxicated and angry. In the morning it is revealed that they think Samnang had stolen and smashed their loot from the city. Molly and Duncan talk to Kleat, who reveals that he had come upon the brothers beating Samnang with their rifles. Unable to kill Samnang in front of Kleat, the brothers let him go, only to pursue him later. The brothers are also agitated because the jungle, growing faster than ever because of the rains from the approaching typhoon, has encroached on the two vehicles, miring them overnight. Calmly, Duncan placates them, helping them free the Land Cruiser. Deciding to leave that evening, the group breaks into teams: Two brothers will try to free the Mercedes truck from the mud. Another brother, the most Americanized of the trio, will go with Duncan to search for loot to replace that which Samnang had smashed. Molly and Kleat will do the same. Molly makes a grisly discovery - Samnang's artificial leg being gnawed on by gibbons, and then finds another Eleventh Cav body in a bamboo grove - a suicide by self- inflicted gunshot. She calls for the others, and they help her extract the corpse's helmet, remaining scalp and hair, and three teeth. They return to the vehicles, but the Cambodian brother who was with the trio has gotten separated from them. As they wait, Kleat seizes the opportunity and jumps into the Land Cruiser, driving off. The vehicle runs over several land mines, obliterating it. The two brothers, angrily chasing their Land Cruiser, also find themselves in the mine field, and both die. Molly, having run out into the mine field as well, discovers the second APC at the bottom of a bomb-crater lake. Duncan slowly rescues her, using a stick to feel cautiously for mines. Deciding that the mysterious Luke has placed the mines to keep them from leaving the city the way they entered it, Molly and Duncan decide to escape through the city, leaving out the other side of it. In case Luke is watching from a distance, Molly and Duncan begin removing supplies from the hopelessly-mired truck, giving the impression that they are going to stay through the typhoon. That night Molly, trying to be helpful, opens Duncan's briefcase to find some items that she can rescue (the duo had agreed to leave everything behind in order to travel faster). She discovers that Duncan was the mysterious troublemaker and thief from the U.S. military search site. The briefcase is also filled with other mysterious items, including ID cards, tags, and photographs. When she confronts him he seems genuinely confused. Suddenly, Luke arrives, and he and Duncan converse cryptically. Luke is now missing three teeth, and Molly realizes, to her horror, the identity of the soldier in the bamboo grove. She uses Kleat's Glock to shoot Luke who, in death, reveals himself to be the missing Cambodian brother. Molly fears that, in a malaria-induced hallucination, she had imagined seeing Luke and had killed an innocent man. She and Duncan flee through the city, growing weaker from minor injuries sustained the day before in the mine field explosions. Duncan's face becomes injured by what appears to be a gunshot, and Molly tries to help him. They find a sheltered room to rest, and when Molly awakes she finds that Duncan is gone. Searching for him, she discovers the cloth used to bind his jaw on the ground - free of blood. Two more soldiers' bodies are later found. One is a suicide by hanging, while the other man had been a sniper who had completely enclosed himself in a nest of razor wire to prevent anything from getting to him...or to prevent him from going anywhere. Duncan's trail leads to the top room of the tower they group had discovered previously; the observatory room with the remains of the Eleventh Cav men. In the room Molly discovers, under a pile of debris, the body of the soldiers' commander: a young man with a wedding band. To her shock, she discovers that his name is Duncan O'Brian. In his belongings Molly finds a photograph of her mother, who had committed suicide when Molly was a baby. She realizes that Duncan O'Brian, an Army soldier, was her father, and that his death in the war drove her young mother to kill herself. Later, still in the room, she discovers that Duncan O'Brian had been killed by a soldier named John Kleat in retaliation for getting them lost and trapped in the city. The panicked soldiers, trying to hide the death of their commander, had buried their commander under tons of explosive-induced rubble and exiled the killer, Pvt. John Kleat. Molly, unable to see in the dark, is approached by a presence who talks to her. He has a bag full of jade eyes, which had been seen in the skulls of all the intact American soldiers' remains. Horrified, Molly realizes that this mysterious person intends to remove her eyes and replace them with jade. She loses consciousness. When she awakes she is being rescued by members of the U.S. military team from the original dig - Samnang had somehow made it back to civilization and told them about her. It is not revealed if her eyes had indeed been replaced with jade.

The motte lay at the centre of two concentric outer bailey walls, producing a roughly circular castle approximately 150 yards across.Rushforth and Knowles, p.9. The motte was placed against the south-west corner of the site, where the ground fell away from the castle, giving additional protection from attack. A square stone keep may have been built at a later stage on the motte, and a church was built in the outer bailey. At the start of years of the Anarchy the castle was controlled by the powerful Miles de Gloucester.Amt, p.44.

As a PIDE agent, Monteiro carried out the high-profile assassinations of Humberto Delgado, opposition leader to Salazar's Portuguese dictatorship, and Eduardo Mondlane, leader of FRELIMO. Early life Monteiro was born in Portuguese Goa to a white Portuguese father and a native Goan mother, an aguadeira from the city of Ponda. He lived in Portugal for sometime before joining General Franco's army in the Spanish Civil War. After the war, Monteiro moved to the United Kingdom, where he worked for a butcher whose daughter he married. Goa-Portuguese Colonial Era In the 1950s, Monteiro joined the Portuguese Colonial Police in Goa, where he interrogated Goan liberation movement activists. Much of the brutal torture/ interrogations took place at Valpoi Police Station. There were several local theatro songs of the dreaded Agent Monteiro. PIDE agent After Goa's annexation by the Indian Army in 1961, Monteiro was recruited by the Pol√≠cia Internacional e de Defesa do Estado (PIDE), the dreaded Portuguese Secret Service. Initially, he participated in a campaign to organise an anti-Indian resistance among Goans code named Plan Gralha. PIDE agents used the Emissona Nacional, radio station which continued to broadcast after 1961, to broadcast stories of Goan non-cooperation with Indian authorities. Plans were made to sabotage port facilities at Mormugao and Bombay. In 1962, a bomb was planted at Vasco Municipal School in March 1962, and another at a different location in October. Casimiro was implicated in bomb blasts on June 20, 1964. The Portuguese government, in an official statement to the UN , later claimed that the attacks were acts of revolt against Indian rule. In 1965, he assassinated General Humberto Delgado in Spain. General Delgado was the Opposition Leader against the Salazar Dictatorship. Monteiro, who had shot Delgado and strangled his secretary, was found guilty by the Spanish courts and was sentenced to 19 years in absentia. In the late 1960s, Monteiro went to Portuguese Mozambique (as a PIDE agent) to fight FRELIMO (Frente de Liberta√ß√£o de Mo√ßambique), a movement fighting for independence against the internationally recognized Portuguese Government. Most of the Frelimo fighters were based in Tanzania. Monteiro crossed into Tanzania, and using a parcel bomb assassinated Eduardo Mondlane, the founder Leader of FRELIMO. Later life He returned to Portugal, but after the 1974 Carnation Revolution, which overthrew the Portuguese dictatorship, Monteiro took refuge in the South African Embassy.

It started its shooting in August 2010 and was released on 25 December 2010.Tournament Malayalam Movie Preview, Synopsis - Malayalam movie Tournament Preview, Synopsis The film features songs by Deepak Dev and original score by Alex Paul. Cinematography was handled by Venu and Amal Neerad for a song. Lal used a new format called play-replay, which is really the first in Malayalam film: One scene is replayed from different viewpoints after several scenes. Lal used this technique in the full length of the film. Plot The movie begins by introducing the main characters of the story, Usman Ali, Viswanathan and Balachandran playing cricket. Their coach informs the three that they are selected for APL Cochin team's final selection tournament in Bangalore. Excited, they celebrate and accidentally meets Aswathy Alex a freelance photographer. Right before the trip, Balachandran is injured while riding the bike and misses his trip to Bangalore. Unfortunately for Viswanathan and Usman, their flight gets cancelled due to a bomb threat. Aswathy then motivates then to take a road trip and have fun while travelling telling them that it will relax them. Bobby (whom they meet at the airport) also joins them in this trip. The rest of the trip they have a lot of adventure. Usman suffers from food poisoning while eating from a Dabba and is hospitalised. He misses the tournament due to this. The scene cuts back to the incident where Balachandran was injured. Now it shows that it was Usman who pulled a thread in between the roads and caused the accident to Balachandran. They proceed with their journey. But Vishwanathan hurts his leg when the jeep losses its control. They decide to halt the journey for a while. In the meanwhile, both Aswathy and Bobby then go to investigate John Subrahmaniyam. They meet a teashop owner who promises to help them investigate John. They enter John's house in the pretext of being his girlfriend's cousins. But John identifies them and warns them to stay away. But they engage in a fight and Bobby loses his consciousness. When he wakes up in the morning, he sees a dead Aswathy. But the tea shop owner rescues him. In the replay, we are shown that Aswathy is not dead. In another replay scene, it is shown that it was Bobby who opens the door causing Viswanathan to fall and break his leg. Tea shop owner asks Bobby to leave the place. Bobby drives away and we are revealed that the tea shop owner is actually John Subrahmaniyam. Now he regrets his action. Later Viswanathan becomes Man of the Match of the tournament. Bobby marries Aswathy in the presence of Viswanathan, Usman and Balachandran.

Various sources have described the group as left-wing in its political orientation. History The idea of UK Uncut originated in October 2010 with a group of ten activists in a north London pub who claimed that clamping down on tax avoidance would be a credible alternative to public sector spending cuts. Private Eye had recently published an article alleging that Vodafone had reached a highly favourable settlement of a long-standing tax dispute with HM Revenue and Customs so they organised a protest against a store on Oxford Street. Protesters met at Piccadilly and successfully closed the store. Tactics and targets The group uses direct action to disrupt the business of high street stores and banks that they believe have a connection with tax avoidance. Actions are organised independently by local UK Uncut groups and promoted through the UK Uncut website. Vodafone was targeted after Private Eye alleged that a deal they made with HM Revenue and Customs substantially reduced the amount of back taxes that they had to pay. Private Eye alleged that Vodafone were originally found liable for ¬£6 billion, but negotiated the amount to be paid down to under ¬£2 billion. However, the National Audit Office said that the settlement represented reasonable value for the British taxpayer.Settling large tax disputes National Audit Office. Nao.org.uk (2012-06-14). Retrieved on 2013-08-12. The Arcadia Group's shops including Topshop, BHS, and Burton have been targeted as the group is owned by Tina Green, the wife of Sir Phillip Green. Tina Green is a resident of Monaco and was able to receive a dividend of ¬£1.2bn from the group free of UK income tax in 2005. Boots was targeted on 30 January 2011 as the protesters claimed it avoided UK tax by being registered in Switzerland. Three people needed hospital treatment after police used CS spray when attempting to arrest a protester. Fortnum & Mason was targeted during the 26 March 2011 anti-cuts protests. UK Uncut claimed that the parent company, Wittington Investments was \\"guilty of tax avoidance\\". This took the form of a mass sit-in. The police arrested and charged 138 protesters with aggravated trespass. Of these, ten were convicted and were given a conditional discharge and fined ¬£1,000. Their convictions were upheld at the Court of Appeal. In November 2011, the legal arm of UK Uncut took HM Revenue & Customs to court. HMRC had been accused of failing to provide substantial reasons for not collecting billions of pounds in tax revenue. HMRC are unable to comment on specific taxpayers' tax affairs. Instead, the National Audit Office (NAO) were asked to review the settlements in question, one being Vodafone, as mentioned above. The NAO found that \\"the settlements reached by HMRC in these five cases were all reasonable\\". Banks Through meetings on Twitter at the end of January it was decided that the next UK Uncut targets would be banks that were alleged to have caused the financial crisis and had been bailed out by the government with billions of pounds. UK Uncut called for people to stage \\"bail-ins\\" to turn banks into things that UK Uncut perceived as being threatened by the cuts. HSBC have also been accused of avoiding ¬£2 billion worth of tax by Private Eye magazine by using a complicated system of channeling profits through the Netherlands,. On 19 February 2011, Barclays was targeted. The date was arranged to coincide with their bonus announcements. It was also alleged that Barclays was only paying 1% corporation tax in the UK. On 26 February, a day of action was called against the Royal Bank of Scotland and their subsidiary NatWest. The protest was arranged to coincide with the banks' bonus announcements. Once again protestors turned bank branches into services that they considered were threatened by the cuts. Healthcare On 9 October 2011, 2,000 health workers and activists took part in a sit-down protest on Westminster Bridge organised by UK Uncut in opposition to the proposed Health and Social Care Bill. The group has also targeted Atos, an IT company whose healthcare division operates a program for the Department for Work and Pensions to assess workers claiming disability benefits to see if they are \\"incapable\\" of work. Critics have felt that its program has lacked integrity and that its real goal is to divert funding from the disabled due to a lowered budget. The group also felt that it was inappropriate for Atos to sponsor the 2012 Summer Paralympics in London, a complementary event to the Olympics for the disabled given how its operation of the program has impacted the lives of many disabled workers through the denial of benefits. UK Uncut held a week of protests dubbed \\"The Atos Games\\" during the last week of August to coincide with the start of the Paralympics ending with a joint demonstration with Disabled People Against Cuts on 31 August outside the London headquarters of Atos and the Department for Work and Pensions. UK Uncut protesters, who were unimpressed by Starbucks' offer to pay ¬£20 million corporation tax in the next two years, took part in protests in December 2012. Spin-offs A similar protest group inspired by UK Uncut has formed in the US under the name US Uncut. The protest also spread to other European countries, creating decentralized protest groups like Portugal Uncut. A group called Take VAT targeted several companies avoiding VAT by selling goods to the UK through the Channel Islands.

He was baptised on 21 November 1628. His brothers were Hugh Boscawen (1625‚Äì1701), MP, and Charles Boscawen (1627‚Äì1689), MP, both of whom also represented Cornish constituencies. The Boscawens are an ancient Cornish family. His father Hugh Boscawen (fl.1620) of Tregothnan was thirteenth in descent from a certain Henry de Boscawen.Foster,Joseph, Peerage, Baronetage and Knightage of the British Empire for 1882, London, 1882, p.273, quoted by Kain, Roger & Ravenhill, William, (eds.)

On 10 June, after the outbreak of war, she deployed for patrol and convoy defense based at Aden. On 21 June she carried out an attack on , a , which was unsuccessful. Then, on 23 June, she was deployed with Kandahar, Kingston and the sloop in search for Torricelli near Perim Island. After interception, Khartoum and these warships took part in a surface engagement with the submarine, during which Torricelli was sunk and Shoreham damaged. However, during the battle, Khartoum was hit by return fire which damaged the after torpedo tube mounting. Loss Some five and a half hours later, at 11.50am (local time), a torpedo's compressed air chamber exploded, propelling the warhead through the deck house of number 3 4.7-inch mount. and causing a serious uncontrollable fire from a ruptured oil tank there. This resulted in an explosion of the ship's magazine, killing one of the ship‚Äôs company, injuring three others and wrecking the stern structure aft of the engine room while causing extensive flooding. The ship beached on an even keel with forward structure awash and the ship‚Äôs company was rescued by Kandahar and taken to Aden, Yemen. Yeoman of Signals John Murphy was awarded a Mention in Despatches for his actions in securing the ship's code books. The ship's equipment was dismantled and other security measures were implemented before the ship was abandoned. The shipwreck, in position 12¬∫38'N, 43¬∫24'E, remained visible after the end of World War II. Confusion over cause of sinking Some sources regard the damage from Torricelli (a hit in one area of the ship, followed by an explosion there later) as instrumental in Khartoums sinking.Stern, Robert (2007) The Hunter, Hunted p215. Leventhal Ltd. Others regard it as coincidental, pointing to the five and a half hour time lag between the incidents. They also suggest her loss seems more due to inexperienced damage control. The Admiralty inquest found the immediate cause of the loss was a torpedo air flask explosion which caused an uncontrollable fire and magazine explosion. It noted that similar incidents with the Mark IX torpedo had occurred on other ships. The inquest also ruled out damage from enemy action and sabotage, even though captured members of Torricellis crew were housed aboard.

She saw service in the Pacific Theater of Operations during the latter stages of World War II and the immediate postwar period. Construction and commissioning Comet was laid down under a Maritime Commission contract as the Maritime Commission type C2-S-B1 hull MC 293 by the Moore Dry Dock Company at Oakland, California, and was launched on 21 December 1942, sponsored by Mrs. E. Warren. She was commissioned as USS Comet (AP-166) on 15 February 1944 with Commander V. F. Stieglitz, USNR, in command. U.S. Navy service World War II Comet cleared San Diego, California, on 26 April 1944 carrying U.S. Marines to Pearl Harbor, Territory of Hawaii. She then conducted training in the Hawaiian Islands until 30 May 1944, when she departed for Eniwetok. On 11 June 1944, combat loaded, she put to sea for Japanese-held Saipan, where she unloaded troops and cargo under heavy fire in the initial assault beginning the Battle of Saipan on 15 June 1944. On 22 June 1944 she departed Saipan for Pearl Harbor to load troops for the invasion of Guam, where she landed her men as reinforcements between 23 and 29 July 1944 during the Battle of Guam. Returning to Pearl Harbor for training until 15 September 1944, Comet then sailed to Manus Island, from which she put to sea 14 October 1944 bound for the landings on Leyte in the Philippine Islands. She put her troops ashore on Leyte between 20 October 1944, the day of the initial assault, and 22 October 1944, thus clearing Leyte Gulf before the great naval Battle of Leyte Gulf in those waters. She returned to Leyte in November 1944, carrying reinforcements from New Guinea. After that, Comet trained off Noumea in New Caledonia and at Guadalcanal for the assault on Lingayen Gulf on Luzon in the Philippines, where she arrived on 11 January 1945 with troops to reinforce those who had made the assault landings two days earlier. From New Guinea, she brought another group of reinforcements in February 1945, then departed Lingayen Gulf to carry hospital patients from Pearl Harbor to San Francisco, California. After an overhaul, Comet cleared Port Hueneme, California, on 4 June 1945, carrying construction battalion men (Seabees) and equipment to Okinawa, where she arrived on 12 July 1945 after calling at various ports en route. World War II came to end on 15 August 1945. Postwar Until 1 August 1946, Comet ranged the Pacific Ocean in the postwar redeployment of military men and the return to the United States of homeward-bound veterans. She made seven transpacific voyages, calling at such ports as Okinawa, Guam, Saipan, Hollandia, Manus, Sasebo, Tsingtao, and Taku in the western Pacific; Kodiak, Dutch Harbor, Adak, and Attu in the Territory of Alaska; Seattle, Washington; and San Francisco, San Pedro, and San Diego, California. Disposal Comet was decommissioned at Seattle on 14 August 1946, and transferred to the War Shipping Administration for disposal. On 1 September 1946, the War Shipping Administrations functions were transferred to the United States Maritime Commission, which sold Comet to American Pioneer Lines in 1948. Commercial career American Pioneer Lines renamed the ship SS Pioneer Reef. In 1965, Pioneer Reef was sold and renamed SS Australian Reef. Australian Reef was sold for scrapping at Kaohsiung, Taiwan, in May 1970. Honors and awards USS Comet received three battle stars for her World War II service, for: the Marianas operation (the capture and occupation of Saipan, 15 to 22 June 1944, and the capture and occupation of Guam, 23 to 29 July 1944), the Leyte operation (the Leyte landings, 20 to 22 October 1944), and the Luzon operation (the Lingayen Gulf landings, 11 January 1945).

As of 2016, after several bankruptcies over previous decades, it is operated by a non-profit organization called the Upper Valley Snow Sports Foundation.http://s6235.p10.sites.pressdns.com/uvssf/ Upper Valley Snow Sports Foundation History The ski area dates to 1956, when a small slope called Snow Crest Ski Area was developed by Lebanon Outing Club ski jumping champion Ernest Dion.http://www.newenglandskihistory.com/NewHampshire/whaleback.php It had a T-bar and a rope tow for novices. Snow Crest closed in 1968 and reopened in 1970 as Whaleback Ski Area. It operated continuously until 2001 when then- owner Timothy Herbert closed it. On 8 December 2004, Herbert sold Whaleback to Evan Dybvig, a former freestyle skier for the US Ski Team. In preparation for its reopening, $1 million was spent in renovating the area, which opened for the 2005-2006 ski season. Dybvig intended for the ski area to diversify its offerings into the freestyle sports market, including constructing an indoor sports facility. However, after several investors dropped out of the project, and a planned loan from the Small Business Administration failed to materialize, these plans were dropped. During the area's first two seasons, poor weather hurt it financially, leading to a program announced in August 2006 where individuals could pay to either place a plaque on or paint one of the chairs on Whaleback's chairlift. As of 2010, the ski area employed between five and nine employees, and had a revenue of between $500,000 and $1 million per year. On 14 March 2013, Whaleback announced that high debt had led the mountain to close after the 2012-2013 season. According to Dybvig, Whaleback owed its creditors more than $1 million, and was unable to raise additional funding, leading it to liquidate before it was forced into foreclosure. During the summer of 2013, a local non-profit organization, the Upper Valley Snow Sports Foundation (UVSSF), was established to operate and eventually purchase the mountain. An initial round of fundraising raised about $200,000, enough to reopen Whaleback for the 2013-2014 season. The UVSSF signed an agreement with the owner of the property, Randolph National Bank, to operate the ski area for a year, and purchased it in 2013 for $650,000.

The wreck was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. History An early photograph of the Emperor The Emperor was constructed in 1910 by the Collingwood Shipbuilding Co. in Collingwood, Ontario, for the Inland Lines Ltd. of Midland, Ontario. It was launched on December 17, 1910 and assigned registry number 126,654. At 525 feet in length, it was the largest Canadian-built freighter ever built at the time of her launching. The ship had a beam of 56 feet in beam, a depth of 27 feet, with 4641 registered tons and 7031 gross tons. It contained a 1,500 horsepower triple expansion steam engine with two Scotch boilers which powered the ship to a nominal speed of 10 knots. The Emperor was built of steel, with an arch and web frame construction to provide an unobstructed cargo hold with hatches placed every 12 feet. The pilothouse, captain's quarters, and mate's quarters were at the bow of the ship, and the crew's quarters and engine room were aft, with unobstructed deck space between. Although launched in 1910, the Emperor did not begin its first voyage until April 1911. On its first trip, the ship broke its main shaft in Thunder Bay, Ontario and had to be towed all the way to Detroit for repairs. Also in 1911, the ship overrode its anchor while in the Soo locks, tearing a hole in the bottom and sinking the vessel. In May, 1916, the ship was sold to the Canada Steamship Lines Ltd. It was involved in some additional minor incidents, including the death of a crew member who fell into the hold in 1918, groundings in 1926 and 1937, and the loss of a rudder in 1936. The wreck of the Emperor The Emperor left Thunder Bay, Ontario on the night of June 3, 1947, laden with 10,429 tons of iron ore. At about midnight, the captain turned the ship over to the first mate, who had been in charge of loading cargo only hours earlier. It is likely that fatigue contributed to the mate's failure to catch the error in the ship's heading. At 4:15 on the morning of June 4, the Emperor ran aground on the north side of Canoe Rocks, on the northeast end of Isle Royale. The ship sank within 30 minutes, killing twelve crewmembers, including both the captain and the first mate. A Coast Guard cutter was nearby, and the remaining crewmembers were rescued 30 minutes later. Search and rescue operations were begun shortly thereafter, but no more survivors were found. Some dives were made to the wreck to locate remains of the crew, but no salvage operations were attempted. The body of a victim was discovered by sport divers in 1975, and was reportedly removed by Canadian officials. The wreck of this ship is a significant event in the history of Thunder Bay, Ontario. The wreck today The Emperor quickly became an attraction to sport divers. There is some detritus located near the site from the 1910 stranding of the SS Dunelm. The wreckage is essentially intact, with damage to the bow, but an intact prop, engine room, and numerous cabins. It sits in 25 to 175 feet of water, with the bow sitting higher than the stern. Two dive buoys are available for mooring, one at each end of the ship. The Emperor is the most popular wreck to dive in the Isle Royale National Park, with over 350 dives made in 2009 out of 1062 dives made to wrecks in the park.

The high-level meeting was chaired by United States Vice President Joe Biden. The resolution was passed with 14 votes in favour to none against, and one abstention from France, which said additional financial guarantees were required. Resolution Observations The Council began by recalling the need for the Oil-for-Food Programme as a temporary measure to provide humanitarian aid to the Iraqi people and the need for the country to regain an international standing to the level of that prior to the adoption of Resolution 661 (1990). Acts Acting under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, the Council requested the Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to terminate the residual activities of the Oil-for-Food Programme. He was authorised to establish an escrow account with independent public accountants, in which US$20 million would be retained for the use of United Nations until December 31, 2016, and a further US$131 million retained as compensation for the United Nations with regard to activities in connection with the Programme since its inception in 1995. All remaining funds in the account created by Resolution 1483 were to be transferred to the Development Fund for Iraq. The resolution further requested the Secretary-General to ensure the effective implementation of the resolution and report to the Council.

In 2007, the agency expanded into bigger premises in DUMBO and opened an office in Los Angeles. In 2008 The Interpublic Group acquired a stake in Huge for close to $40 million. In 2009, Huge was named the fastest- growing company across all marketing disciplines by Advertising Age. In 2010, Pepsi announced it was working with Huge on the Pepsi Refresh project, using social media to fund public good projects. Later that year, Aaron Shapiro was named CEO and IPG announced an investment of between $8 million and $10 million to accelerate global expansion for Huge with new offices in Brazil, China, Singapore, and Japan. At this time Skokna and Kirovski departed Huge. In 2011, Huge launched a UX School program offering 12 week UX apprenticeships and opened offices in Rio de Janeiro and London. In 2011, Huge also began working with HBO to design and launch HBO GO, leading to the adoption of streaming TV initiatives by most cable TV brands. Huge would later work with Fox, FX Now, The Simpsons, and Hulu on direct to consumer TV initiatives. Additional offices were opened in San Francisco (later relocated to Oakland), Portland and Washington, DC in 2012. In 2013, Huge opened a production studio to support its expansion from product and web design into marketing as the agency took on integrated marketing work for Samsung and was named social media AOR for Audi. In 2013, Huge also launched the first redesign of New York City's municipal website in a decade. In January 2014, Huge launched a new website and a redesigned logo. The company announced in March 2018 statement that Shapiro would depart the company in May 2018 after 13 years overseeing the growth of the agency. Michael Koziol, international president at Huge, will replace Shapiro as CEO. In May 2019 it was announced Publicis Groupe veteran, Pete Stein would replace Michael Koziol as CEO.  Recognition  Huge won a Bronze Cyber Lion for Best Digitally Driven Integrated Campaign at the Cannes Lions, 2010 for the Pepsi Refresh Project; four prizes at the 2010 OMMA Awards, including Best in Show for the Pepsi Refresh Project, as well as Web Site Excellence awards for Reuters.com and History.com; the Webby Award for best Youth website in 2008 for Scholastic.com; and a Design Distinction Award from I.D.

December 29, 887Academia Sinica Chinese-Western Calendar Converter.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 257.) was a sorcerer late in the Chinese dynasty Tang Dynasty, who became trusted by Gao Pian the military governor (Jiedushi) of Huainan Circuit (Ê∑ÆÂçó, headquartered in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu) and became very powerful at Huainan, at one point becoming more powerful than Gao himself. Subsequently, Gao's officer Bi Shiduo rose in resistance, plunging the circuit into intense internecine warfare. L√º, after Bi defeated him, aligned himself with Yang Xingmi, but after Yang's victory over Bi and Qin Yan, Yang executed him.  Background  It is not known when L√º Yongzhi was born, but it is known that he was from Poyang (ÈÑ±ÈôΩ, in modern Shangrao, Jiangxi) and that he came from a family of tea merchants.New Book of Tang, vol. 224, part 2.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 254. Because of the family's merchant tradition, he had visited and was familiar with Huainan Circuit's capital Guangling (Âª£Èôµ). After his father's death, he became dependent on his maternal uncle, but at some point stole his uncle's money and fled to Mount Jiuhua, where he became a student of the sorcerer Niu Honghui (ÁâõÂºòÂæΩ), who taught him magic. L√º subsequently returned to Guangling and peddled herbs and medicines on the street. He became acquainted with the army officer Yu Gongchu (‰øûÂÖ¨Ê•ö), who was a close associate of the military governor Gao Pian. After he convinced Yu that his magical abilities were genuine, Yu introduced him to Gao. Gao, who was himself dabbling in magic, came to believe in L√º's abilities as well, particularly since L√º also made a number of policy recommendations to him. He thus made L√º an officer in his army and became close to L√º.  Rise to power  After L√º Yongzhi gained Gao Pian's trusts, he began to bribe Gao's attendants to keep Gao under surveillance, so that he could falsely claim to Gao that what he knew was based on his magical powers. He also alienated Gao from those officers that Gao had previously been close to ‚Äî causing Gao to strip Liang Zuan (Ê¢ÅÁ∫ò) of his command, kill Chen Gong (Èô≥Áèô) and his household, and distance himself from Feng Shou (È¶ÆÁ∂¨), Dong Jin (Ëë£Áëæ), Yu Gongchu, and Yao Guili (ÂßöÊ≠∏Á¶Æ). He further introduced fellow sorcerers Zhang Shouyi (ÂºµÂÆà‰∏Ä), Zhuge Yin (Ë´∏ËëõÊÆ∑), and Xiao Sheng (Ëï≠Âãù) to Gao, grouping together to seize more and more of the actual power at Huainan's headquarters. He encouraged Gao to spend much of the army's wealth on building temples, and further established a group of secret police to spy on the people, using what they found as excuses to incriminate people and seize their wealth. Under L√º's suggestion, Gao established an elite Moxie Corps (Ëé´ÈÇ™), with L√º and Zhang in command. L√º lived luxuriously, and gained a group of over 100 concubines, such that even with the great amount of wealth that Gao was giving him, he still had insufficient funds to maintain his households, so he embezzled the funds that Gao had access to as the director of Tang's governmental monopolies on salt and iron, for his own use. It was said that due to L√º's urging that Gao spend his time on seeking divinity, Gao no longer paid any attention to governance and rarely met his staff members, and the people began to not know who he was any more. As it was Yu who initially introduced L√º to Gao, many of Gao's officers blamed Yu for this situation. Yu thus periodically met with L√º to urge him to change his ways, drawing L√º's resentment. L√º was also resentful of Yao for often publicly rebuking him and trying, on one occasion, to assassinate him. In 883, L√º decided to eliminate Yu and Yao. He had Gao issue an order that they attack the agrarian rebels at Shen County (ÊÖéÁ∏£, in modern Hefei, Anhui), and then falsely informed Yang Xingmin (who would later change his name to Yang Xingmi) the prefect of Lu Prefecture (Âª¨Â∑û, in modern Hefei) that Yu and Yao were going to attack him. Yang reacted by ambushing Yu and Yao, killing them, and then informing Gao that Yu and Yao were intending to rebel. Gao, not knowing that this was all L√º's treachery, rewarded Yang. In 884, when Gao Pian's nephew Gao Yu (È´òÊæû) met with Gao Pian and submitted a list of 20 crimes of L√º's, Gao Pian confronted L√º with them, but L√º managed to convince Gao Pian that Gao Yu had only accused him of crimes because Gao Yu had previously tried to borrow money from L√º but L√º declined. Gao Pian expelled Gao Yu from his household, made him the prefect of Shu Prefecture (ËàíÂ∑û, in modern Anqing, Anhui), and later, after Gao Yu suffered defeats at the hands of agrarian rebels, executed Gao Yu.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 255. In 886, when Gao supported the claim of the pretender Li Yun for the Tang throne (in competition with the commonly recognized Emperor Xizong), Li Yun, whose main proponent Zhu Mei then-controlled the imperial capital Chang'an and forced Emperor Xizong to flee, bestowed on Gao various honors, but also gave L√º the title of military governor of Lingnan East Circuit (Â∂∫ÂçóÊù±ÈÅì, headquartered in modern Guangzhou, Guangdong).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 256. Because of this title, L√º, who made no attempts to report to Lingnan East, openly established his own headquarters, rivaling Gao's. Gao began to realize that L√º had too much power, but also was apprehensive that he no longer had enough power himself to eliminate L√º. However, L√º nevertheless realized Gao's loss of trust in him, and therefore began to plot to murder Gao and take over the circuit, although he did not carry out the plot at the time. Gao's officers have, by this point, all fearful of L√º's authority. Bi Shiduo, who had formerly been a follower of the agrarian rebel Huang Chao, was particularly anxious because of that fact. Further, Bi had a dispute with L√º over an incident involving one of Bi's concubines, who was known for being beautiful; because of her reputation of beauty, L√º had wanted to see her appearance, and Bi refused, but on one occasion when Bi was not at home, L√º went to see her anyway, and Bi, in anger, threw her out of the household.  Battle against Bi Shiduo  In summer 887, the warlord Qin Zongquan, who had rebelled against Emperor Xizong's rule at Cai Prefecture (Ëî°Â∑û, in modern Zhumadian, Henan), was sending generals out to attack the nearby circuits. Gao, hearing news that Qin was sending an army his way, commissioned Bi to take the special Baiqi Corps (ÁôæÈ®é) to Gaoyou to prepare to resist the Qin advance. As Bi was about to leave, L√º treated him especially well, which led Bi to fear that L√º was intending to get his guards down to act against him. Even Bi's mother was fearful, and she sent a messenger to him to state, \\"If something like that happens, you should strive for yourself. Do not worry about your mother or children.\\" When Bi consulted the defender of Gaoyou, Zhang Shenjian (ÂºµÁ•ûÂäç), whose daughter had married Bi's son, Zhang believed that L√º would not act against Bi. However, at that time, one of Gao's sons wanted Bi to act against L√º so that he could use this chance to show L√º's evil nature, intentionally sent Bi a message stating, \\"L√º Yongzhi had frequently met with the Chancellor [(i.e., Gao, who carried an honorary chancellor title)] and wants to act against you. An order has already been sent to Minister Zhang [(i.e., Zhang, who carried an honorary minister title)]. Be careful!\\" Bi confronted Zhang, who knew nothing about it, but subsequently agreed, along with Bi and Bi's friend Zheng Hanzhang (ÈÑ≠Êº¢Á´†), to rise against L√º. On May 1, 887, Bi and Zheng, after issuing public declarations denouncing L√º, departed Gaoyou and advanced toward Yang Prefecture. L√º oversaw the defense and was initially able to repel Bi's attacks. Bi, who believed that his army was not strong enough to capture Yang Prefecture, sent a letter to Qin Yan, who was then the governor (ËßÄÂØü‰Ωø, Guanchashi) of Xuanshe Circuit (ÂÆ£Ê≠ô, headquartered in modern Xuancheng, Anhui), offering the military governorship of Huainan to him and asking for aid. Qin sent his officer Qin Chou (Áß¶Á®†) to reinforce Bi. Meanwhile, Gao and L√º had a falling out inside the city, and Gao put up a defense at his headquarters, commanded by his nephew Gao Jie (È´òÂÇë), to guard against L√º. Gao Pian subsequently sent the officer Shi E (Áü≥Èçî) to meet with Bi, along with Bi's youngest son. Bi ordered his young son to return to Gao Pian, stating, \\"If the Chancellor executes L√º Yongzhi and Zhang Shouyi to show me his intent, I will surely not turn back on his grace, and I am willing to have my wife and children serve as hostages.\\" Gao Pian, worried that L√º might preemptively slaughter Bi's family, put Bi's family under protective custody. On May 17, Bi made a fierce attack on Yang Prefecture, but L√º's counterattack defeated him. However, at this juncture, Gao Jie launched an attack from Gao Pian's headquarters, intending to capture L√º to deliver to Bi. L√º, hearing the news, abandoned Yang Prefecture and fled. Bi took over Yang Prefecture, slaughtered L√º's associates, put Gao and his family under effective arrest, and welcomed Qin Yan to Yang Prefecture to take over as military governor. After leaving Yang Prefecture, L√º attacked Zheng's base of Huaikou (Ê∑ÆÂè£, in modern Huai'an, Jiangsu), where Zheng had left his wife in charge, but could not capture it. Meanwhile, during the siege, L√º had issued an order in Gao's name making Yang Xingmi the commander of the circuit forces and ordering him to come to Yang Prefecture's aid. Yang mobilized the troops of Lu Prefecture and that of neighboring He Prefecture (ÂíåÂ∑û, in modern Chaohu, Anhui) and headed for Yang Prefecture. When L√º heard that Yang had arrived at Tianchang (Â§©Èï∑, in modern Chuzhou, Anhui), he went there to rendezvous with Yang, as did Zhang, when he got into a dispute with Bi over the pillages and decided to join Yang as well.  Alliance with Yang Xingmi and death  Yang Xingmi put Yang Prefecture under siege for months, but could not capture it, despite a terrible famine that developed inside the city. (During the siege, Qin Yan put Gao Pian and his family to death.) Yang thus considered withdrawing. However, on November 18, L√º Yongzhi's former subordinate Zhang Shenwei (ÂºµÂØ©Â®Å) opened the city gates and welcomed Yang's army in. The city thus fell to Yang; Qin and Bi Shiduo fled. Meanwhile, during the siege, L√º had falsely claimed to Yang that he had a secret stash of silver that he would offer to Yang's soldiers as rewards when the city fell. After the city fell and L√º failed to come up with the silver, Yang put him under arrest and had Yang's subordinate and friend Tian Jun interrogate L√º. L√º confessed to previously planning to murder Gao and take over the circuit. On the same day (December 29), Yang had L√º put to death by cutting him in two at the waist and slaughtered his followers. It was said that those who hated L√º came to cut off the flesh off his bones and, quickly, only a skeleton was left.

All members of the family resemble the Sukhoi Su-27 in general form, or the Sukhoi Su-33 more closely, but built around a single example of the Saturn AL-31 engine instead of two, and scaled down accordingly to a smaller layout. The design was offered to several potential customers, including South Africa and India, but was turned down. Development is apparently on hold, awaiting a launch customer. Design and development Genesis The project traces its origins to a 1990 requirement to replace the aging Aero L-39 jet trainers, which were reaching the end of their service lives. The Aero L-29 had originally been selected as a Warsaw Pact standard trainer in 1961, in preference to the Yak-30 and PZL TS-11 Iskra. It started to be replaced in 1974 by the greatly updated L-39, powered by the new Ivchenko AI-25 engine. By 1990 the Soviet Air Force had about 1,000 L-39s on force, when the new Czech Republic stated they would no longer be supplying spares. The Soviet Air Force's commander-in-chief, Air Marshal Yefimov, issued a statement on the issue on 20 April 1990. On 25 June 1990 the first official RFP document was issued for the Uchebno-Trenirovochnyi Samolyot (UTS) program. Four companies responded with designs, the Mikoyan MiG-AT, Yakovlev Yak-130 (then known as the Yak-UTS), the Myasischev M-200 and the S-54. Most of these designs were typical trainers; they were built to be docile in handling, low cost in operation, and were essentially all-new in design. Sukhoi decided to take a different approach, and develop a true high- performance design closer to a fighter than a trainer. Advances in aerodynamics and flight controls allowed even the most advanced fighters have docile handling suitable for transition training, while at the same time the older generation aircraft had handling so different from modern aircraft that it gave them limited utility. Given their extensive experience with upgraded versions of the original Su-27, Sukhoi chose to use much of this design in the new trainer. Versions with one AL-31 or two smaller engines were studied, with the single-engine version favoured throughout. The design that emerged appeared to be a Su-33 with a fuselage plug removed behind the cockpit, giving it a cross-section similar to other advanced trainers of the era. The first design study, shown publicly not long afterwards, was upgraded and improved during 1992. A new version, with airframe enlarged by approximately 25 per cent, was revealed at 1996 Farnborough Air Show. The Yak-130 eventually won the UTS contract, and Sukhoi started looking for other markets. S-55 and S-56 Sukhoi then modified the design to allow it to mount the same radar as the Su-27, the Phazotron Sokol. Shown in June 1997, the S-55 was a lighter, shorter-range fighter that complemented the Su-27 in the same way the F-16 complements the F-15. Designed as a low-cost fighter, primarily for export, the S-55 was nevertheless a very advanced design compared to similar fighters that were \\"up-converted\\" from trainers. Sukhoi also produced the S-56, essentially an S-55 adapted for carrier use. The design was deliberately tailored for the Admiral Kuznetsov, and was designed to fit into a 10 by 3 by 3 meter space, making it one of the most compact naval fighters ever designed. The small size, especially vertically, opened the possibility of adding another internal deck between the two existing aircraft decks in the Kuznetsov, increasing the total number of fighters that could be carried by two to three timeshttps://mdb.cast.ru/mdb/3-2001/di/sgpst/?form=print. The S-56 was also offered to the Indian Navy in 1999, but was not purchased.

There are two metal ladders leaning together within the tower, as well as a fake door with a big lock on one side of the tower's base., SIRIS. The sculpture measures 40 feet in height and was created in 1983. Historical information A committee of local expert artists was formed to judge the student sculptures as well as an advisory group of Peck employees to help in deciding the winning design. Richard Pflieger was the winning student with a design called Angel in a Cage, which was a fiberglass angel suspended in a tower of steel fencing. The artist's inspiration came from the many fences throughout the Menomonee Valley in contrast with the numerous shrines with angels in the back yards of the Milwaukee south side homes. The committee suggested the artwork should be forty feet high for the best sculptural impact and biggest statement. Pflieger took almost two years to complete this sculpture which still towers today now in front of Emmber Foods Incorporated on Canal Street in Menomonee Valley.Buck, Diane M. and Virginia A. Palmer (1995). Outdoor Sculpture in Milwaukee: A Cultural and Historical Guidebook, p. 88-89. The State Historical Society of Wisconsin, Madison A structural engineer named Matthew Fuchs of the Milwaukee School of Engineering and fellow student Michael Pagelsdorf advised Pflieger to use 4 ¬Ω\\" steel pipe with ¬Ω\\" wall thickness when building the tower structure. Fence material and even labor were donated by Heritage Fence of Cedarburg. The angel inside the cage is fiberglass and resin which was made from a clay model and has a metal interior. This structure is a great example of cooperative effort of both public education and private business which has the power to create outdoor artwork installations. Artist Richard Pflieger graduated with a degree in sculpture from the Milwaukee Institute of Art and Design in 1987. He worked as an industrial designer, a career that has shaped his artwork. Pflieger is interested in studying mood and emotion, as well as in the identity of mass- produced objects.

The fashion for sleeves also changed: though sleeves earlier in the fifteenth century are attached to the bodice, after 1450, they are usually detached and laced or pinned to the bodice.

The song shares only its title with Blind Blake's song \\"Diddie Wah Diddie\\" recorded in 1929. Over the years, the Bo Diddley song has been covered by many bands and artists, including The Astronauts, Captain Beefheart and his Magic Band, Leon Redbone, The Remains, The Twilights, Taj Mahal, The Sonics, The Fabulous Thunderbirds, Ty Segall Band, and The Blues Band among others. Original version by Bo Diddley \\"Diddy Wah Diddy\\" was Bo Diddley's fourth single release on Checker Records, and was released in early 1956. The song was recorded on November 10, 1955 in Chicago, Illinois. The recording featured The Moonglows on backing vocals, Willie Dixon on bass, Jody Williams along with Bo Diddley on guitar, Clifton James on drums, Jerome Green playing the maracas, and Little Willie Smith on harmonica.

He can be seen wBo at Bo's 1st & last (he was banned for not playing the shows requested song) Nov 20th 1955 appearance on the Ed Sullivan show. Lyrically, the song makes mention of the mythical town of Diddy Wah Diddy.

Of all the imaginary locations that were in common usage at the time, folklorist and ethnomusicologist Benjamin A. Botkin has noted that Diddy Wah Diddy was \\"the largest and best known of the Negro mythical places.\\" It was commonly believed that in Diddy Wah Diddy food could be found in abundance, the townsfolk did not have to work, and people and animals had no concerns. Dixon and McDaniel's song is sung from the point of view of a man whose lover lives in this mythical location, as evidenced by such lines as... :She loves her man, just is a pity :Crazy 'bout my gal in Diddy Wah Diddy :Ain't no town, and it ain't no city :But oh, how they love in Diddy Wah Diddy The song is often confused with Blind Blake's similarly titled 1928 song, \\"Diddie Wa Diddie\\", which was also covered by various bands and artists mostly under the name \\"Diddy Wah Diddy\\". Captain Beefheart version Captain Beefheart and his Magic Band recorded a blues rock version of the track, produced by David Gates (later the leader of Bread), in January 1966 at Sunset Sound Recorders studio in Hollywood, California. The song was the band's first single, released on the A&M; label in March of that year. Some copies of the single incorrectly credit the songwriter as \\"A. Christensen\\".

Stages St. Ignatius was strongly influenced by the Renaissance and wanted Jesuits to be able to offer whatever ministries were most needed at any given moment, and especially, to be ready to respond to missions (assignments) from the Pope. Formation for priesthood normally takes between 8 and 17 years, depending on the man's background and previous education, and final vows are taken several years after that, making Jesuit formation among the longest of any of the religious orders. At this point, the novice pronounces his First Vows (perpetual simple vows of poverty, chastity and obedience and a vow to persevere to final profession and ordination) and becomes either a Scholastic (entering onto the path of priesthood) or a Jesuit brother. The scholastics (who may be addressed by the secular title \\"Mister\\") and the Brothers (addressed by the title \\"Brother\\") of the Society of Jesus have different courses of study, although they often overlap.Formulas of the Institute of Popes Paul III and Julius III from Constitutions of the Society of Jesus pp. 3-15 Course of studies For scholastics, the usual course of studies is as follows:Jesuit Formation from Jesuit Vocations UK retrieved 19 June 2013 * First Studies is the period when the scholastic begins his academic formation. Depending on his prior education it will last 2‚Äì4 years, guaranteeing a grounding in philosophy and the attainment of at least a first university level degree thus, in the United States, a four-year bachelor's degree (unless this has already been earned). It may also introduce the study of theology or some other specialized area. * As Jesuits, particularly in the United States, serve on the faculties of high schools and universities, and in a wide variety of other positions, the Jesuit scholastic or Jesuit priest often earns a master or doctoral degree on some area‚Äîit may be, for instance, Theology or it may be History, English, Chemistry, Educational Administration, Law or any other subject. Hence, a Jesuit may spend another few years earning a graduate degree beyond the bachelor's. * Regency is the next stage, wherein the scholastic lives and works in a typical Jesuit community (as opposed to the \\"formation communities\\" he has lived in so far). He is engaged full-time in ministry (an Apostolate), which is traditionally teaching in a secondary school, but it may be any ministry Jesuits are engaged in. Regency lasts for 2‚Äì3 years. * Theology is the stage for Jesuits immediately preceding ordination. By universal canon law, every candidate for priestly ordination must complete four years in the study of theology, though part of this requirement may have been met in the first period studies. This will include the attainment of a first degree in theology (such as the Bachelor of Sacred Theology), and usually a second (masters level) degree in a specialized area related to theology. (As such, it is not uncommon for a Jesuit to hold a master's level degree in Theology, and, as mentioned above, a second master's or a doctorate in a completely different field.) At the end of theology studies, candidates for the Catholic priesthood are ordained to the transitional diaconate, and serve as a deacon for six months to a year.Jesuit Formation Process from Jesuit California retrieved 19 June 2013 * Ordination to the priesthood follows, and the new priest may receive a ministerial assignment or be sent back for further studies in any academic field. * The ordained Jesuit priest will either be chosen for profession as a \\"spiritual coadjutor\\", taking the usual perpetual vows of poverty, chastity and obedience, or for profession as a \\"professed of the four vows.\\" * A few years after ordination to priesthood, or for brothers after a number of years work, a Jesuit will undertake Tertianship, so named because it is something like a third year of novitiate. After his first few years of experience of ministry as a priest or brother, the Jesuit completes the final stage of formal formation by revisiting the essentials of Jesuit life which he learned as a novice: once again, he studies the history and Constitutions of the Jesuits, he makes the Spiritual Exercises and participates in experimentism, most often by serving in ministries to the sick, terminally ill or poor. * Final Vows for the fully professed follow upon tertianship, wherein the Jesuit pronounces perpetual solemn vows of poverty, chastity, obedience, and the Fourth vow, unique to Jesuits, of special obedience to the pope in matters regarding mission, promising to undertake any mission laid out in the Formula of the Institute the pope may choose. * Only the professed of the Four Vows are eligible for posts like novice master, provincial superior or assistant to the general of the society. * The professed of the Four Vows take, in addition to these solemn perpetual vows five additional Simple Vows: not to consent to any mitigation of the Society's observance of poverty; not to \\"ambition\\" or seek any prelacies (ecclesiastical offices) outside the Society; not to ambition any offices within the Society; a commitment to report any Jesuit who does so ambition; and, if a Jesuit does become a bishop, to permit the general to continue to provide advice to that bishop, though the vow of obedience to Jesuit superiors is not operative over matters the man undertakes as bishop. Under these vows, no Jesuit may \\"campaign\\" or even offer his name for appointment or election to any office, and if chosen for one must remind the appointing authority (even the Pope) of these Vows‚Äîif the Pope commands that the Jesuit accept ordination as a bishop anyway, the Jesuit must keep an open ear to the Jesuit general as an influence. Jesuit brothers The formation of Jesuit brothers has a much less structured form. Before the Second Vatican Council, Jesuit brothers worked almost exclusively within Jesuit communities as cooks, tailors, farmers, secretaries, accountants, librarians and maintenance support‚Äîthey were thus technically known as \\"temporal coadjutors\\", as they assisted the professed priests by undertaking the more \\"worldly\\" jobs, freeing the professed of the four vows and the \\"spiritual coadjutors\\" to undertake the sacramental and spiritual missions of the Society. Following the Second Vatican Council, which recognized the mission of all the Christian faithful, not just those who are ordained, to share in the ministries of the Church, Jesuit brothers began to engage in ministries outside of their communities. Today, the formation of a Jesuit brother may take many forms, depending on his aptitude for ministry. He may pursue a highly academic formation which mirrors that of the scholastics (there are, for instance, some Jesuit brothers who serve as university professors), or he may pursue more practical training in areas such as pastoral counseling or spiritual direction (some assist in giving retreats, for instance), or he may continue in the traditional \\"supporting\\" roles in which so many Jesuit brothers have attained notable levels of holiness (as administrative aides, for example).Jesuit brother vocation from ThinkJesuit.org retrieved 19 June 2013 Since Vatican II, the Society has officially adopted the term \\"brother\\", which was always the unofficial form of address for the temporal coadjutors.

Listed at , 145 lb., she batted and threw right-handed. A brief history During World War II, Philip K. Wrigley founded the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League as a promotional sideline to maintain interest in baseball as the military draft was depleting Major League rosters of first-line players. The league made an auspicious debut, averaging about 1,000 fans per game in 1943, while attracting about 210,000 for the entire year. The circuit excelled in attendance and performing during the 1948 season, when 10 teams attracted 910,000 paid fanatics, but by 1954, attendance dropped to only 270,000, when other interests and forms of recreation began to claim the public interest, dooming the league to extinction. It was a neglected chapter of sports history, at least until 1992, when filmmaker Penny Marshall premiered her film A League of Their Own, a fictionalized account of activities in the AAGPBL that brought a rejuvenated interest to the extinct league.IMDb.com ‚Äì A League of Their Own (1992 film) Early life Born in Wyandotte, Michigan in 1927, Romatowski grew up playing sports with her brothers at a very early age. She participated in golf and tennis, but most of the time she played softball, mostly in the streets or in the prairies, until become a member of the Wyandotte's top girls' team. In 1946, she graduated at Theodore Roosevelt High School in Wyandotte and immediately joined the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League.Encyclopedia of Women and Baseball ‚Äì Leslie A. Heaphy, Mel Anthony May. Publisher: McFarland & Company, 2006. Format: Paperback, 438pp. Language: English. AAGPBL career Romatowski moved around for a while, as the AAGPBL shifted players as needed to help new teams stay afloat. She entered the league in 1946 with the South Bend Blue Sox, playing for them one year before joining the Rockford Peaches (1947). She then found herself on the move again, this time to the Chicago Colleens (1948), Racine Belles (1948), Peoria Redwings (1949) and South Bend Blue Sox (1950), before settling down with the Kalamazoo Lassies for the rest of her career (1951‚Äì1954). She was used sparingly at third base and outfield before converting to catcher.Encyclopedia of Women and Baseball A competent backstop, known more for her defensive skills rather than for her offensive output, Romatowski possessed a strong arm with an extremely quick release of the throw, being appropriately dubbed Rifle Arm. In 1952, Romatowski was selected for the All-Star Team as a replacement for Ruth Richard (C) and Fern Shollenberger (3B). The All-Stars, with Bill Allington at the helm, faced the host South Bend Blue Sox, who were managed by Karl Winsch. For the second consecutive year Romatowski joined the All-Star squad in 1953. Her most productive season came in 1954, when she posted career-highs with a .258 average and six home runs, led all outfielders with 24 assists and formed part of the Lassies team that won the championship, during what turned out to be the league's final season.1952 AAGPBL All-Star Team1954 AAGPBL All-Star Team 1954 Kalamazoo Lassies Life after baseball Following her baseball career, Romatowski graduated from Eastern Michigan University with a degree in physical education, and then she taught physical education for nearly 30 years in the Van Dyke-Warren school system until her retirement in 1983. Romatowski remained active by playing field hockey. A natural athlete, she later earned a spot on the United States National team and was chosen to play on an All-Star squad that toured Europe several times in the late 1950s and early 1960s. She even played in the Netherlands at the World Field Hockey tournament in 1959, and was later active as a coach and administrator, rising to first vice president of the U.S. Field Hockey Association. Her next endeavor was breeding and raising greyhound dogs for racing, competing for a number of years in Florida and Alabama. Honors and awards Since 1988 Romatowski is part of Women in Baseball, a permanent display based at the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New York, which was unveiled to honor the entire All-American Girls Professional Baseball League rather than individual baseball personalities. In 1999 she was selected for membership in the National Polish-American Sports Hall of Fame, becoming only the fifth female to be enshrined in the hall. Then, in 2000 she was inducted into the Eastern Michigan University Hall of Fame for her career achievements.EMU Hall of Fame Inductees Besides, she is one of only two women to have been inducted into the Wyandotte Sports Hall of Fame, and was also honored with membership the Michigan Amateur Sports Hall of Fame.Obituary \\"An important part of my involvement in greyhound racing is our adoption service\\", Romatowski explained in an interview. \\"Once a dog‚Äôs racing days are over we help people adopt them... Greyhounds make wonderful house pets\\". Despite her varied sports career, she confessed that never did she realize a childhood goal: becoming a long track speed skater and competing in the Olympic Games. She usually talked about that, but not much because she had so many fond memories of her athletic and teaching careers. In addition, she was active in the National Greyhound Association and owned as many as seven dogs at one time.

The main idea of this form of spirituality comes from Ignatius's Spiritual Exercises, the aim of which is to help one \\"conquer oneself and to regulate one's life in such a way that no decision is made under the influence of any inordinate attachment.\\" The Exercises are intended to give the person undertaking them a greater degree of freedom from his or her own likes and dislikes, that they may choose based solely on what they discern God's will is for them.Busted Halo. Accessed 2 November 2016. Even in the composition of the exercises by Ignatius early in his career, one might find the apostolic thrust of his spirituality in his contemplation on \\"The Call of the Earthly King\\" and in his final contemplation with its focus on finding God in all things. Development Upon his recovery from battle wounds, St. Ignatius of Loyola hung his military accoutrements before the image of the Virgin of Montserrat. After recovering from a leg wound incurred during the Siege of Pamplona in 1521, Ignatius made a retreat with the Benedictines of Montserrat. They introduced him to the \\"Ejercitatoria de la vida espiritual\\" of Garcia de Cisneros, based in large part on the teachings of the Brothers of the Common Life, promoters of the \\"devotio moderna.\\" From there, he spent ten months at Manresa, where he discovered The Imitation of Christ of Thomas √† Kempis. Parts of the Exercises were completed later while he was a student in Paris. General principles Ignatian spirituality has been described as a spirituality of finding God's will for better decision making.Manney, Jim. \\"An Ignatian Framework for Making a Decision\\", Ignation Spirituality, Loyala Press According to Hans Urs von Balthasar, \\"choice\\" is the center of the Exercises.L√∂ser S.J., Werner. \\"The Ignatian Exercises in the Work of Hans Urs von Balthasar\\", Hans Urs Von Balthasar: His Life and Work, (David L. Schindler, ed.) Ignatius Press, 1991, Their original objective was the question of the choice of a state of life. The Ignatian process of making good decisions acknowledges that decisions are often between two goods, understanding that the better good, or \\"the more\\" (lat. magis), is what we instinctively want, and what God wants for us. \\"In all things, to love and to serve\\" (Spanish: en todo amar y servir) was a motto of St Ignatius, who wanted to \\"be like St. Francis and St. Dominic\\", though better. Aspects of Ignatian spirituality Ignatian spirituality has the following characteristics:De La Boullaye, Pinard. Ignatian Spirituality. God's greater glory: St Ignatius of Loyola‚Äî\\"a man who gave the first place of his life to God\\" said Benedict XVI‚Äîstressed that \\"Man is created to praise, reverence, and serve God Our Lord and by this means to save his soul.\\" This is the \\"First Principle and Foundation\\" of the Exercises. Ignatius declares: \\"The goal of our life is to live with God forever. God who loves us, gave us life. Our own response of love allows God's life to flow into us without limit.... Our only desire and our one choice should be this: I want and I choose what better leads to the deepening of God's life in me.\\" Union with Jesus: Ignatius emphasized an ardent love for the Saviour. In his month-long Exercises, he devoted the last three weeks to the contemplation of Jesus: from infancy and public ministry, to his passion, and lastly his risen life. To achieve empathy with Jesus and a closer following of him, Ignatius proposed a form of contemplation that he called \\"application of the senses\\" to the scenes in the life of Jesus. The Spiritual Exercises, in 104, sum this up in a prayer that I may \\"love him more and follow him more closely.\\" There is a considerable emphasis on the emotions in Ignatius' methods, and a call for one to be sensitive to emotional movements. Self-awareness: Ignatius recommends the twice-daily examen (examination). This is a guided method of prayerfully reviewing the events of the day, to awaken one's inner sensitivity to one's own actions, desires, and spiritual state, through each moment reviewed. The goals are to see where God is challenging the person to change and to growth, where God is calling the person to deeper reflection (especially apt when discerning if one has a Jesuit vocation in life), to where sinful or imperfect attitudes or blind spots are found. The general examen, often at the end of the day, is, as the name implies, a general review. The particular examen, often in the middle of the day, focuses on a particular fault‚Äîidentified by the person‚Äîto be worked upon in the course of some days or weeks. Since the 1970s there have been numerous in-depth studies and adaptations of the examen to contemporary needs. This is explained below under the title \\"Examen of Consciousness.\\" Spiritual direction: Meditation and contemplation, and for instance the aforementioned examen, are best guided, Ignatius says, by an experienced person. Jesuits, and those following Ignatian spirituality, meet with their spiritual director (traditionally a priest, though in recent years many laypersons have undertaken this role) on a regular basis (weekly or monthly) to discuss the fruits of their prayer life and be offered guidance. Ignatius sees the director as someone who can rein in impulsiveness or excesses, goad the complacent, and keep people honest with themselves. But the director should not so much explain but simply present the exercises, to not get in the way of God who \\"communicates himself with the well-disposed person.\\" If the director is a priest, spiritual direction may or may not be connected with the Sacrament of Reconciliation. Effective love: The founder of the Society of Jesus emphasized effective love (love shown in deeds) over affective love (love based on feelings). He usually ended his most important letters with \\"I implore God to grant us all the grace to know His holy will and to accomplish it perfectly.\\" This love which leads us to a perfect correspondence with God's will demands self-sacrifice‚Äîrenunciation of personal feelings and preferences. This is expressed in Ignatius' prayer in the last exercise of his Spiritual Exercises, which remains popular among Jesuits: \\"Take Lord and receive, all my liberty.\\" Detachment: Where Francis of Assisi's concept of poverty emphasized the spiritual benefits of simplicity and dependency, Ignatius emphasized detachment, or \\"indifference.\\" This figures prominently into what Ignatius called the \\"First Principle and Foundation\\" of the Exercises. For Ignatius, whether one was rich or poor, healthy or sick, in an assignment one enjoyed or one didn't, was comfortable in a culture or not, etc., should be a matter of spiritual indifference‚Äîa modern phrasing might put it as serene acceptance. Hence, a Jesuit (or one following Ignatian spirituality) placed in a comfortable, wealthy neighborhood should continue to live the Gospel life without anxiety or possessiveness, and if plucked from that situation to be placed in a poor area and subjected to hardships should with a sense of spiritual joy accept that as well, looking only to do God's will. Prayer and efforts at self-conquest: Ignatius's book The Spiritual Exercises is a fruit of months of prayer.O'Malley, John W. The First Jesuits Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard, 1993. . Prayer, In Ignatian spirituality, is fundamental since it was at the foundation of Jesus' life, but it does not dispense from \\"helping oneself\\", a phrase frequently used by Ignatius. Thus, he also speaks of mortification and of amendment. Devotion to the Sacred Heart, the Eucharist, and Our Lady: The Society of Jesus has a relationship with the Order of the Visitation of Holy Mary in a commitment to spread the devotion to the Sacred Heart. Though the concept of devotion to Christ's mercy, as symbolized in the image of the Sacred Heart, goes further back, its modern origins can be traced to St. Marie Alacoque, a Visitation nun, whose spiritual director was the Jesuit St. Claude de la Colombi√®re. The Jesuits promoted this devotion to emphasize the compassion and overwhelming love of Christ for people, and to counteract the rigorism and spiritual pessimism of the Jansenists. St. Ignatius counselled people to receive the Eucharistic bread more often, and from the order's earliest days the Jesuits were promoters of \\"frequent communion\\". It was the custom for many Catholics at that time to receive Holy Communion perhaps once or twice a year, out of what Catholic theologians considered an exaggerated respect for the sacrament. Ignatius and others advocated receiving the sacrament even weekly, emphasizing Holy Communion not as reward but as spiritual food. By the time of Pope Pius X (1903‚Äì1914), \\"frequent communion\\" had come to mean weekly, even daily reception. Ignatius made his initial commitment to a new way of life by leaving his soldier's weapons (and symbolically, his old values) on an altar before an image of the Christ child seated on the lap of Our Lady of Montserrat. Also, the Jesuits were long promoters of the Sodality of Our Lady, their primary organization for their students until the 1960s, which they used to encourage frequent attendance at Mass, reception of Communion, recitation of the Rosary, and attendance at retreats in the Ignatian tradition of the Spiritual Exercises. Since the Second Vatican Council, Marian Sodalities have been largely replaced by small Christian Life Community (CLC) cells which emphasize the service of justice thrust that grew in the Catholic church after Vatican II. The CLC secretariat is at the Jesuit headquarters in Rome. Zeal for souls: The purpose of the Society of Jesus, says the Summary of the Constitutions, is \\"not only to apply one's self to one's own salvation and to perfection with the help of divine grace, but to employ all one's strength for the salvation and perfection of one's neighbor.\\" Finding God in All Things: The vision that Ignatius places at the beginning of the Exercises keeps sight of both the Creator and the creature, the One and the other swept along in the same movement of love. In it, God offers himself to humankind in an absolute way through the Son, and humankind responds in an absolute way by a total self-donation. There is no longer sacred or profane, natural or supernatural, mortification or prayer‚Äîbecause it is one and the same Spirit who brings it about that the Christian will see and \\"love God in all things‚Äîand all things in God.\\" Hence, Jesuits have always been active in the graphic and dramatic arts, literature, and the sciences. Examen of Consciousness: The Examen of Consciousness is a simple prayer directed toward developing a spiritual sensitivity to the special ways God approaches, invites, and calls. Ignatius recommends that the examen be done at least twice, and suggests five points of prayer: * Recalling that one is in the presence of God * Thanking God for all the blessings one has received * Examining how one has lived the day * Asking God for forgiveness * Resolution and offering a prayer of hopeful recommitment It is important, however, that the person feels free to structure the Examen in a way that is personally most helpful. There is no right way to do it; nor is there a need to go through all of the five points each time. A person might, for instance, find oneself spending the entire time on only one or two points. The basic rule is: Go wherever God draws you. And this touches upon an important point: the Examen of Consciousness is primarily a time of prayer; it is a \\"being with God.\\" It focuses on one's consciousness of God, not necessarily one's conscience regarding sins and mistakes. Discernment: Discernment is rooted in the understanding that God is ever at work in one's life, \\"inviting, directing, guiding, and drawing\\" one \\"into the fullness of life.\\" Its central action is reflection on the ordinary events of one's life. It presupposes an ability to reflect, a habit of personal prayer, self- knowledge, knowledge of one's deepest desires, and openness to God's direction and guidance. Discernment is a prayerful \\"pondering\\" or \\"mulling over\\" the choices a person wishes to consider. In discernment, the person's focus should be on a quiet attentiveness to God and sensing rather than thinking. The goal is to understand the choices in one's heart, to see them, as it were, as God might see them. In one sense, there is no limit to how long one might wish to continue in this. Discernment is a repetitive process, yet as the person continues some choices should, of their own accord, fall by the wayside while others should gain clarity and focus. It is a process that should move inexorably toward a decision. Service and humility: Ignatius emphasized the active expression of God's love in life and the need to be self-forgetful in humility. Part of Jesuit formation is the undertaking of service specifically to the poor and sick in the most humble ways: Ignatius wanted Jesuits in training to serve part of their time as novices and in tertianship as the equivalent of orderlies in hospitals, for instance emptying bed pans and washing patients, to learn humility and loving service. Jesuit educational institutions often adopt mottoes and mission statements that include the idea of making students \\"men and women for others\\", and the like. Jesuit missions have generally included medical clinics, schools, and agricultural development projects as ways to serve the poor or needy while preaching the Gospel. Some groups who find the Ignatian \\"way of proceeding\\" helpful include the Society of the Sacred Heart of Jesus (RSCJ), the Faithful Companions of Jesus (FCJ), the Loreto Sisters (IBVM), the Religious Sisters of Charity (RSC), the Oblates of the Virgin Mary, and the Christian Life Communities (CLC).EWTN on Ignatian influence. Accessed 2 November 2016.  Spiritual Exercises  According to St Ignatius, the purpose of the Exercises is \\"to conquer oneself and to regulate one's life in such a way that no decision is made under the influence of any inordinate attachment.\\" In other words, the Exercises are intended, in Ignatius' view, to give the exercitant (the person undertaking them) a greater degree of freedom from his or her own likes, dislikes, comforts, wants, needs, drives, appetites, and passions that they may choose based solely on what they discern God's will is for them and their students. Peter Hans Kolvenbach, while Superior General of the Jesuits, said that the Exercises \\"try to unite two apparently incompatible realities: exercises and spiritual.\\" It invites to \\"unlimited generosity\\" in contemplating God, yet going down to the level of many details.Discourse given to the Rome Consultation, 16 February 2003.

The gene encodes a protein of 416 amino acids, designated as hepaCAM**, which is a new member of the immunoglobulin superfamily of cell adhesion molecules (IgSF CAM). The main biological functions of hepaCAM include a) modulating cell-matrix adhesion and migration, and b) inhibiting cancer cell growth. (Note: *HEPACAM, gene name; **hepaCAM, protein name) Discovery Through differential screening of gene expression, over 200 genes were found to be either up- or down-regulated in a hepatocellular carcinoma patient. These genes were subsequently evaluated against a panel of human HCC specimens, leading to the identification of a novel gene HEPN1. Based on the sequence of HEPN1, the new gene HEPACAM was then isolated and characterised. Characteristics and functions Structurally, hepaCAM is a glycoprotein containing an extracellular domain with 2 Ig-like loops, a transmembrane region and a cytoplasmic domain. Matched to chromosome 11q24, gene HEPACAM is ubiquitously expressed in normal human tissues, with particularly high expression levels in the central nervous system (CNS), and is frequently suppressed in a variety of tumour types. Functionally, hepaCAM is involved in cell-extracellular matrix interactions and growth control of cancer cells, and is able to induce differentiation of glioblastoma cells. In cell signaling, hepaCAM directly interacts with F-actin and calveolin 1, and is capable of inducing senescence-like growth arrest via a p53/p21-dependent pathway. Moreover, hepaCAM is proteolystically cleaved near the transmemberane region. These findings indicate that the new Ig-like cell adhesion molecule hepaCAM is also a tumour suppressor. Other names #glialCAM, which was cloned from a human brain cDNA library in 2008 and found to be identical to hepaCAM; and #HEPACAM1, when HEPACAM2 emerged in 2010.

Civil parishes gained legal functions in 1845 which parochial boards were established to administer the poor law. Their local government functions were abolished in 1930 with their powers transferred to county or burgh councils. Since 1975, they have been superseded as the smallest unit of local administration in Scotland by community councils. History Civil parishes in Scotland can be dated from 1845, when parochial boards were established to administer the poor law. While they originally corresponded to the parishes of the Church of Scotland, the number and boundaries of parishes soon diverged. Where a parish contained a burgh, a separate landward parish was formed for the portion outside the town. Until 1891 many parishes lay in more than one county. In that year, under the terms of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889, the boundaries of most of the civil parishes and counties were realigned so that each parish was wholly within a single county. In 1894 the parochial boards were replaced by more democratically elected parish councils. Parish councils were in turn abolished in 1930, under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1929, with powers being transferred to county councils in landward areas of counties and burgh councils where they were within a burgh. Their boundaries continued to be used to define some of the local authorities created by the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 and they continue to be used for census purposes and they are used as part of the coding system for agricultural holdings under the Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS) used to administer schemes within the Common Agricultural Policy. According to the website of the General Register Office for Scotland, there are now 871 civil parishes. Relationship with ecclesiastical parishes Civil parish boundaries originally corresponded with the ecclesiastical parishes of the Church of Scotland. As parishes used for religious functions diverged from civil parishes, the former became known as quoad sacra parishes. Community councils Since 1975, Scotland has been divided into community council areas which are often similar to civil parishes in their boundaries. These community council are not equivalent to English parish councils and Welsh community councils and do not have legal powers of their own but in some cases local authorities have a legal obligation to consult them.

The civil parish of Thurles, shown divided into its townlands. Civil parishes () are units of territory in the island of Ireland that have their origins in old Gaelic territorial divisions. They were adopted by the Anglo-Norman Lordship of Ireland and then by the Elizabethan Kingdom of Ireland, and were formalised as land divisions at the time of the Plantations of Ireland. They no longer correspond to the boundaries of Roman Catholic or Church of Ireland parishes, which are generally larger. Their use as administrative units was gradually replaced by Poor Law Divisions in the 19th century, although they were not formally abolished. Today they are still sometimes used for legal purposes. Origins The Irish parish was based on the Gaelic territorial unit called a t√∫ath orTr√≠cha c√©t. Following the Norman invasion of Ireland, the Anglo-Norman barons retained the tuath, later renamed a parish or manor, as a unit of taxation. The civil parish was formally created by Elizabethan legislation. Accounts were kept of income and expenditures for each parish including pensions and poor relief. Statutes were based on ecclesiastical parishes, although it is not known how well-defined such parishes were. At the time of the English Civil War, in 1654‚Äì56 a Civil Survey was taken of all the lands of Ireland. It proved inaccurate, and in 1656‚Äì58 the Down Survey was conducted, using physical measurements to make as accurate a map as was possible at the time of townlands, parishes and baronies. This became the basis for all future land claims. Parishes are an intermediate subdivision, with multiple townlands per parish and multiple parishes per barony. A civil parish is typically made up of 25‚Äì30 townlands. It may include urban areas such as villages. A parish may cross the boundaries of both baronies and counties; in some cases it may be in several geographically separate parts. Civil parishes had some use in local taxation. They were included on the nineteenth-century maps of the Ordnance Survey of Ireland.HC Deb 25 June 1903 vol 124 c543 The Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898 established administrative counties divided into county districts (urban districts and rural districts) making parishes largely obsolete, and they were removed from subsequent editions of OS maps. For poor law purposes district electoral divisions replaced the civil parishes in the mid-nineteenth century. Townlands are the smallest land unit in Ireland, and were the most precise address that most rural people had until the 2015 introduction of postcodes. Relationship to ecclesiastical parishes An 1871 report to parliament noted that there were three classes of parish in Ireland: the civil parish, the Church of Ireland parish and the Roman Catholic parish. The first two generally but not always had the same boundaries, while the third generally did not. As a result of the 16th-century Protestant Reformation, the Roman Catholic church had to adapt to a structure based on towns and villages, with parishes that generally were larger than the old parishes. A Tudor statute, renewed in 1695 by the Irish parliament, said that land should be granted in each parish for a resident Protestant schoolmaster. The Union of Parishes (Ireland) Act 1827 defined rules for redefining parish boundaries, erecting Chapels of Ease and making Perpetual Cures. It has since been amended and in part repealed. While the boundaries of the parishes of the Church of Ireland changed following the disestablishment of the church in 1869, this did not affect the boundaries of the civil parishes. The 1871 report noted that ecclesiastical parish boundaries must be flexible to meet the requirements of the cure of souls, but that for statistical and possibly administrative purposes the boundaries of civil parishes should be fixed, or at least should rarely change. Administrative uses By 1800 civil parishes had replaced the ecclesiastical parishes for administrative purposes. although the timing and method of the change is not well-documented. The civil parish was used for census and taxation purposes. The civil parishes were included on the nineteenth-century maps of the Ordnance Survey of Ireland. At the time of the 1861 census there were 2,428 civil parishes in Ireland (average area ). Poor Law districts were created in 1838, each centered on a large town. There were 130 poor law unions with 829 registration districts and 3,751 district electoral divisions for census purposes. In 1898 poor law unions replaced civil parishes as the basic local government unit. Later \\"parish councils\\" which gained a modicum of official recognition were based on Roman Catholic parishes: first those recognised by the Congested Districts Board for Ireland; and later those recognised by Part VIII of the Local Government Act 1941, mainly set up by Muintir na T√≠re and operating during the Second World War Emergency. Recent years Civil parishes have not been formally abolished in either Northern Ireland or the Republic of Ireland, and are still used in some legal contexts. One example where the parish is still referenced in Republic of Ireland law is the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988, which allows \\"any person resident in the parish in which the club premises are situated\\" to object to the granting of an alcohol licence to a club. Until 1981 the Republic's official census reports included the populations of civil parishes in and near cities, because \\"numerous requests\\" were still being made for them. In 2001 there were 2,508 civil parishes. Old records of marriages, births etc. are mostly organised by civil parish. Church of Ireland parishes usually conform to civil parish boundaries.

History Grassy Hill was the site of Lieutenant James Cook landing in 1770. Cooktown was established in October 1873 to accommodate for the Palmer River gold rush, and became a thriving port in the 1880s. The first lights in and out of the port were leading lights set on sheds on the wharves. A signal staff was erected on Grassy Hill in 1874 to announce incoming ships, and a cottage was constructed for the signal staff operator in 1878-79. By 1882 a temporary light was set on the hill. In 1883 and 1884, George Poynter Heath, Portmaster of Queensland and Chairman of the Queensland Marine Board at that time, made two reports to the parliament, recommending that the temporary light be replaced with a permanent building and a proper apparatus. Grassy Hill Light was finally constructed in 1886. It was the second in a group of eight lighthouses in Queensland made of hardwood frame clad with corrugated iron, which includes, by order of establishment Little Sea Hill Light, itself, Goods Island Light, Bay Rock Light, Old Caloundra Light, North Point Hummock Light (demolished), Gatcombe Head Light (demolished) and Bulwer Island Light. The apparatus was a 4th Order fixed Chance Bros Dioptric apparatus, and Heath himself supervised its installation in September 1886. The light source was a kerosene lamp. The light keeper resided in the existing cottage and also maintained a signal staff. Grassy Hill Light, 1917. The flag pole and the residence are also visible In 1900 a new cottage was constructed for the light keeper. In 1912 a report recommended that the lighthouse be automated, leaving the keeper only the signal duties. However, this recommendation was not to be taken for some time. In 1913 a wireless station was installed nearby and in 1915 the light, alone with all other coastal lights, was transferred to the control of the Commonwealth government. It was only in 1927 the lighthouse was finally automated, the light source was changed to an acetylene gas burner, and the station was demanned. The keeper's house and signal staff were destroyed about that time. Front entrance of the radar shack and imitation lighthouse keeper's cottage During World War II, from early 1942 to February 1945, a radar station was operated by the 56 Radar Unit, RAAF near the lighthouse. An imitation lighthouse keeper's cottage was constructed for camouflage purposes, and the defensive installations surrounded the station. All structures were removed after the war. In 1970 a sandstone cairn was placed at the summit of the hill to commemorate the bi-centenary of Cook's survey from the summit. Control of the lighthouse remained in the hands of the Commonwealth until November 1987, when it was transferred back to the Queensland government, with the Department of Transport operating the light, Cook Shire Council as trustees for the reserve, and local volunteers maintaining the tower. In 1993 the lighthouse was converted to solar power. Structure The lighthouse is conical in form, about high, constructed of timber clad with corrugated iron sheets, on a concrete base. It is about diameter at the base. Small rectangular windows are set about mid-height on the south and east sides. Entrance is through a small entry on the western side, with timber-framing, convex corrugated iron roof, and timber double doors. The tower is topped by a balcony supported on timber brackets which has a lightweight balustrade. The cylindrical lantern sits above, capped with a hemispherical dome. Access to the light is via a timber stair. The tower is painted white, with the dome and the concrete base painted red. Display The light characteristic shown is two white flashes every six seconds (Fl.(2)W. 6s). It is visible only on a limited sector, 192¬∞-315¬∞, and obscured elsewhere.List of Lights Operation and access The site is managed by the Cook Shire Council. It is accessible by road and parking is also provided. The tower is, however, closed to the public.

Life Helen Eugenia Hagan was born in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, the daughter of John A. and Mary Estella Neal Hagan. She studied piano with her mother and then in the public schools of New Haven, Connecticut. Around the age of nine, she began playing organ for the Dixwell Avenue Congregational Church in New Haven. She studied at Yale University with Stanley Knight and graduated in 1912 with a bachelor's degree in music, performing as soloist on her own Concerto in C Minor in May 1912 at a performance by the New Haven Symphony Orchestra conducted by Horatio Parker.New Haven Symphony Orchestra archives In doing so, she became the first known African American woman to earn a Yale degree. She received the Samuel Simmons Stanford scholarship to study in Paris, with Blanche Selva and Vincent d'Indy, and graduated from Schola Cantorum in 1914. She returned to the United States as World War I began and began a career as a concert pianist, touring from 1915 to 1918. In 1918 she was music director (meaning music department chair) at Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial State College. In early 1919 she left for France to entertain black troops of the AEF, along with Joshua Blanton and Rev. Henry Hugh Proctor, under the auspices of the YMCA. General John Pershing personally requested that Ms. Hagan entertain the troops. In 1920 Hagan married John Taylor Williams of Morristown, New Jersey but continued her concert career (they divorced ca. 1931). She had a music studio in Morristown for at least a decade and was the first African American woman admitted to the Morristown Chamber of Commerce. She taught at the Mendelssohn Conservatory of Music in Chicago and pursued a Masters of Arts degree from Teachers College, Columbia University. In the 1930s she served as dean of music at Bishop College in Marshall, Texas. She also continued to work as a choir director and church organist. She died in New York City after an extended illness. On September 29, 2016, a crowdfunded monument for Hagan's previously unmarked grave was unveiled at New Haven's Evergreen Cemetery, and the day was declared \\"Women Making Music Day\\" by New Haven mayor Toni Harp. The New Haven Symphony Orchestra's season opening concert that evening was performed in Ms. Hagan's honor. Yale University's School of Music is having Helen Hagan's Concerto in C Minor re-orchestrated based on existing scores and planned to have the resurrected work performed by the Yale Philharmonia until the COVID-19 crisis led to postponement of the November 2020 concert. Works The only work by Helen Hagan that survives is the Concerto in C Minor for Piano and Orchestra. Her other compositions, including piano works and a violin sonata, have been lost.

His field of expertise was modern European history, his most notable work being A History of the Great War, 1914‚Äì18. He is mainly remembered, however, for the vendetta pursued against him by the novelist Evelyn Waugh, in which Waugh showed his distaste for his former tutor by repeatedly using the name \\"Cruttwell\\" in his early novels and stories to depict a sequence of unsavoury or ridiculous characters. The prolonged minor humiliation thus inflicted may have contributed to Cruttwell's eventual mental breakdown. Cruttwell gained first-class honours at The Queen's College, Oxford, and was elected a Fellow of All Souls College, Oxford, in 1911, and he became a lecturer in history at Hertford College the following year. His academic career was interrupted by war service, during which he suffered severe wounds; he returned to Oxford in 1919 and became dean of Hertford, and then principal of the college in 1930. It was during his tenure as dean that the feud with Evelyn Waugh developed while Waugh was a history scholar at Hertford in 1922‚Äì1924. Waugh pursued this hostility until shortly before Cruttwell's death. Cruttwell's term as Hertford's principal saw the production of his most important scholarly works, including his war history which earned him the degree of DLitt. Beyond his college and academic duties Cruttwell held various administrative offices within the university, and was a member of its Hebdomadal Council, or ruling body. In private life Cruttwell served as a Justice of the Peace in Hampshire, where he had a country home, and stood unsuccessfully for the university's parliamentary seat in the 1935 general election, representing the Conservative Party. Ill-health, aggravated by his war injuries, caused his retirement from the Hertford principalship in 1939. A mental collapse led to his committal to an institution, where he died two years later. Early life and career Family background, childhood and education Cruttwell was born on 23 May 1887, in the village of Denton, Norfolk, the eldest of three sons of the Rev. Charles Thomas Cruttwell, Rector of St Mary's Church. The elder Cruttwell was a scholar and historian of Roman literature; his wife Annie (n√©e Mowbray), was the daughter of Sir John Mowbray, who served as Conservative member of parliament for Durham from 1853 to 1868 and for one of the two Oxford University parliamentary seats from 1868 to 1899. The young Cruttwell was educated at Rugby School, where in 1906 he won a scholarship to The Queen's College, Oxford, to read classics and history. At Queen's, Cruttwell enjoyed considerable academic success, including a first class honours degree in modern history. In 1911 he was elected to a fellowship at All Souls College and a year later was appointed to a history lectureship at Hertford College. First World War On the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914, Cruttwell was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the 1/4th Battalion, Royal Berkshire Regiment, a Territorial Force unit in which his brother was also serving. By 1915 he was serving in the trenches, in France and Flanders, and led numerous patrols into no man's land, receiving a severe leg wound. Early in 1916, persistent myalgia and rheumatism led to him being declared unfit for further active service. In August 1917 he was an instructor with an Officer Training Battalion in Oxford, and late in the war joined the Intelligence Department at the War Office. Demobilised in 1919, he resumed his academic life in Oxford, and in 1922 published a short history of his regiment's wartime exploits. Apart from its physical effects, Cruttwell's wartime experience seemingly inflicted permanent psychological damage on his personality, replacing the general good manners of his youth with a short-tempered, impatient and bullying character. The novelist Evelyn Waugh, an undergraduate at Hertford in the 1920s, wrote later that \\"It was as though he had never cleansed himself from the muck of the trenches\\". Hertford College Hertford College, Oxford On his return to Hertford College, Cruttwell was elected to a fellowship in modern history and a year later was appointed Hertford's dean, responsible for general discipline within the college; he held this post for five years. He also became active in the administration of Oxford University and was elected to its ruling body, the Hebdomadal Council. He served as a university statutory commissioner and was one of several academics nominated by the Vice-Chancellor as delegates to the Oxford University Press. Cruttwell's administrative competence was recognised in 1930, when he was elected principal of Hertford College. In this office, he helped to establish the university's geography school and arranged that the first Oxford professorship in geography was based at Hertford. During his tenure as principal, he completed his most significant academic works, including his Great War history (1934) which earned him the Oxford degree of DLitt. In 1936 Cruttwell delivered the Lees-Knowles Lecture at Trinity College, Cambridge, under the title \\"The Role of British Strategy in the Great War\\". In the same year he published a biography of the Duke of Wellington and in 1937 produced his final major academic work, A History of Peaceful Change in the Modern World. An attempt in 1935 to emulate his grandfather and become one of the university's members of parliament failed when, as a Conservative candidate in the general election of 1935, Cruttwell was defeated. An Independent, A. P. Herbert, beat him on the third ballot in a single transferable vote system. This was the first time since the 1860s, that a Conservative had failed to hold either of the two university seats, a humiliation noted with relish by Waugh who harboured a deep hostility towards his former tutor. (letter from Waugh to his parents, 26 November 1935) According to The Times, Cruttwell had underestimated the nature and determination of the opposition and had taken his election as a Conservative for granted. In first preferences, he came bottom of the poll with only 1,803 votes, while his Conservative running mate, Lord Hugh Cecil, gained 7,365, almost five times as many. Because he polled less than one-eighth of the first ballot votes, Cruttwell forfeited his deposit. Feud with Evelyn Waugh Evelyn Waugh circa 1940. Waugh continued to mock Cruttwell in his fiction until 1939, shortly before Cruttwell's final illness and death. Evelyn Waugh joined Hertford College on a scholarship in January 1922. He had received a congratulatory letter from Cruttwell welcoming him to the college and complimenting him on his English prose: \\"about the best of any of the Candidates in the group\\". Despite this warmth, Waugh's initial impressions of his tutor were unfavourable‚Äî\\"not at all the kind of don for whom I had been prepared by stories of Jowett.\\" The main basis for the rift that rapidly developed between them was Waugh's increasingly casual attitude towards his scholarship. Cruttwell saw the scholarship as a commitment to hard and devoted study. Waugh, however, considered the scholarship a reward for his successful school studies and a passport to a life of pleasure. He involved himself in a range of university activities to the detriment of his academic work, until Cruttwell brusquely advised him in his third term that he should take his studies more seriously‚Äîa warning which Waugh interpreted as an insult. \\"I think it was from then on that our mutual dislike became incurable\\", he wrote. During his remaining time at Hertford, Waugh missed few opportunities to ridicule Cruttwell. He did this in numerous unsigned contributions to Isis, including an article in March 1924 in the \\"Isis Idols\\" series. The mockery in this article was disguised as a paean of praise, according to Waugh's biographer Martin Stannard, arranged around an unflattering photograph of Cruttwell displaying \\"bad teeth within an unfortunate smile\\". Cruttwell made no apparent response to these provocations, other than a dismissive reference to Waugh as \\"a silly suburban sod with an inferiority complex\\". Waugh left Hertford in the summer of 1924 without completing his degree, and he received a brief note from Cruttwell expressing disappointment with his performance. The pair never met again, but Cruttwell spoke disparagingly of Waugh a few years later to Waugh's prospective mother-in-law Lady Burghclere, describing him as vice-ridden and \\"living off vodka and absinthe\\". Once Waugh had established himself as a writer, he resumed the vendetta against his former tutor by introducing a succession of disreputable or absurd characters named Cruttwell into his novels and stories. In Decline and Fall (1928), Toby Cruttwell is a psychopathic burglar; in Vile Bodies (1930), the name belongs to a snobbish Conservative MP. In Black Mischief (1932), Cruttwell is a social parasite, and he becomes a dubious osteopath or \\"bone-setter\\" in A Handful of Dust (1934). In Scoop (1938), General Cruttwell is a salesman with a fake tropical tan at the Army and Navy Stores.; The 1935 short story \\"Mr Loveday's Little Outing\\" recounts the grisly deeds of an escaped homicidal maniac, and it was originally published as \\"Mr Cruttwell's Little Outing\\". The final Cruttwell reference in Waugh's fiction came in 1939 in the short story \\"An Englishman's Home\\" in the form of an embezzling Wolf Cub master. and (from \\"An Englishman's Home\\" by Evelyn Waugh, first published in Good Housekeeping, London 1939) A survey was conducted in 1935 in which novelists were asked to nominate their best work, and Waugh responded that he had yet to write his masterpiece: \\"It is the memorial biography of C. R. M. F. Cruttwell, some time Dean of Hertford College, Oxford, and my old history tutor. It is a labour of love to one to whom, under God, I owe everything\\". Cruttwell made no public response, although he anticipated each new Waugh novel with much anxiety about how he might be portrayed, according to Stannard. Later years Cruttwell remained a bachelor his whole life. His one proposal of marriage was to socialite and New York society hostess Anne Huth-Jackson, but it was rebuffed and there are no accounts of other romantic attachments. Beyond his academic duties, he enjoyed entertaining at his country house near the village of Highclere in Hampshire where he was active in the local community and served as a Justice of the Peace. His health suffered from the effects of his war wounds, and he was subject to recurrent rheumatic fever. In 1939, his poor physical condition caused him to retire early from Hertford, followed by a period of mental illness possibly exacerbated by the continuing mockery from Waugh. He was ultimately confined to the Burden Neurological Institute at Stapleton, Bristol, where he died on 14 March 1941, aged 53. He left his book collection and a bequest of ¬£1,000 to Hertford College, together with an oil portrait of him painted in 1937 by his cousin Grace Cruttwell. The probate value of his estate was ¬£19,814. Reputation Cruttwell's professional reputation has been overshadowed by the attention given to his feud with Waugh, the true significance of which, according to Geoffrey Ellis's biographical sketch, may have been exaggerated. Cruttwell's experiences as a soldier were such that he spent his entire career writing about war, according to another biographer. \\"In A History of Peaceful Change in the Modern World (1937) he wracks his brains for peaceful changes that were not contingent upon war\\". His standing as a military historian is largely based on his 1934 Great War history, which Ellis praises as \\"most notable for its frank and fearless judgements on those identified as the principal actors (military, naval and political) in that tragic conflict\\". The work was widely praised in the press at the time of publication; The Naval Review thought that its description of the Battle of Jutland was \\"admirable\\": \\"for those who wish to gain a clear but not too detailed idea of the general course of the war, and of the relations of the different parts of it to one another, the book should be invaluable\\". Against this, the Royal United Services Institute's review thought the book under-sourced and the quality of its writing poor in places. More recently, writer and broadcaster Humphrey Carpenter has criticised the book as lacking in humanity, displaying \\"almost no awareness of the appalling degree of suffering it chronicles\\". Nevertheless, historian Llewellyn Woodward considered it \\"the most profound study of any war in modern times\\", and the inspiration for his own Great War history of 1970, while strategist Colin S. Gray describes Cruttwell as \\"the most balanced of the historians of that conflict\\". Cruttwell's relations with his colleagues and students have been the subject of contradictory reports. Waugh's biographer Selena Hastings describes him as \\"unprepossessing\\" in appearance, \\"good-hearted but difficult\\", inclined to misogyny, brusque and sometimes offensive towards his male colleagues. Waugh's description is of someone \\"tall, almost loutish, with the face of a petulant baby\\", of indistinct speech, who \\"smoked a pipe which was attached to his blubber-lips by a thread of slime\\". Stannard records that Waugh's student contemporary Christopher Hollis found nothing particularly remarkable about Cruttwell. \\"Like Waugh\\", says Stannard, \\"Cruttwell played up his eccentricities and had an uncharitable sense of humour\\". Ellis's 2004 biographical sketch suggests that much of Cruttwell's rebarbative manner may have been the result of simple shyness. There was clearly mutual animosity between Cruttwell and Waugh, and Hastings points out that Cruttwell would have been justified in suspending Waugh from the college on numerous occasions but did not do so. Ellis acknowledges a \\"forceful, forthright and eccentric character\\" but stresses Cruttwell's generous hospitality to close friends and his concern for his undergraduates' welfare.

It is located on the 673 meters (2,208 ft) high Sackpfeife mountain near the city of Biedenkopf in Hesse, just a few meters away from the border to North Rhine-Westphalia. It is used for radio and formerly TV broadcasting. Because of the close proximity to North Rhine-Westphalia, the facility is also used by the Westdeutscher Rundfunk to cover certain valleys which cannot be reached by either Ederkopf transmitter or Nordhelle transmitter. However, the signals are transmitted omnidirectionally and so cover large parts of Hesse as well. The transmitter was first constructed in 1953 as a steel tube pylon. This was replaced in 1982 by a 210 meters high guyed lattice tower. Coverage The Biedenkopf transmitter covers mostly the very mountainous region around the cities of Waldeck and Frankenberg to the north, as well as the area to the south up to the city of Limburg an der Lahn. It also happens to reach far into the east and south-east direction including Frankfurt am Main. The signals don't reach into the west at all because of the unsuitable geography, and the Taunus mountain range restricts the range to the south.

However, because it still transmits primarily in the north- east direction, it can hardly be heard in the main populated cities.
