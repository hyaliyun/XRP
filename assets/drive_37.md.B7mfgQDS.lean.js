The Advocate, August 13, 2011. The central story follows the title character, Oaf Jadwiga, as he searches for love in a city that is never explicitly named, but is based on San Francisco. A number of subplots include Oaf's bizarre relationship with his cats (of which he owns dozens) and obsession with disco grindcore band Eja¬©uloid, whose lead singer Eiffel is Oaf's primary love interest. The comic also presents an extensive supporting cast of characters, many of whom have starred in their own spin-off stories and mini-comics. Originally funded by a grant from Prism Comics, the series was self-published in five volumes.\\"Fantagraphics to publish Ed Luce‚Äôs ‚ÄòWuvable Oaf': An interview with the author\\". Comic Book Resources, May 10, 2014. It was compiled in graphic novel form by Fantagraphics Books in 2015.\\"Wuvable Oaf by Ed Luce Review\\". Paste, May 14, 2015. A second volume titled Wuvable Oaf: Blood and Metal, focusing on Oaf's life prior to the story told in the original comics, was published in 2016.\\"Ed Luce‚Äôs Wuvable Oaf Gets A Sequel About His Origin For 2016\\". Bleeding Cool, February 25, 2016.  Relationship to \\"Bear\\" culture and mainstream audience  Wuvable Oaf loosely depicts men who could be characterized as part of the gay \\"bear\\" subculture in that they are queer and of a large, hirsute body type. Luce has never denied this group is the primary inspiration for his creations but has noted in several interviews that the words \\"bear\\", \\"gay\\" and \\"queer\\" have never appeared in the comic itself. He states \\"It's pretty obvious to anyone who has cracked the book what's going on\\" and that labels only serve to alienate a potentially larger audience, who might enjoy reading an otherwise completely queer narrative. For this reason, the comic has also been referred to as \\"post-bear\\" and even \\"post-gay\\" for its lack of dependence on identity based rhetoric. As a result, Wuvable Oaf has gained something of a crossover audience, being one of few queer indie comics to receive press outside the gay community. Whitney Matheson, writing for USA Today noted, \\"whether you're gay/straight/something in between, I think you'll find yourself rooting for the Oaf and his quest for somebody to wuv.\\"  Records and special editions  Several Wuvable Oaf comic releases have included 7\\" vinyl singles (usually with a picture disc B-side), credited to the fictitious band Eja¬©uloid, who are portrayed in the story. In reality, the recordings can be attributed to members of legendary Bay Area hardcore band Limp Wrist, as well as members of Talk is Poison. Martin Sorrondeguy is the voice of Eiffel, lead singer of Eja¬©uloid and Oaf's primary love interest. Past songs have included \\"Fearce\\" and \\"Sleep Apnea\\" , which feature a loud, abrasive thrashcore sound, along with spare keyboard lines and samples. Other special edition items have included \\"Oafberry\\" flavored lollipops, various gig posters from the bands, temporary \\"stubble\\" tattoos, custom guitar pics and scratch & sniff cards portraying the various characters' personal scents. Luce has stated that he considers his comics to be more like \\"art projects\\", which extend beyond the confines of the two- dimensional page. Awards Luce garnered two Ignatz Award nominations for the series, in 2009 for Promising New Talent\\"Nominees announced for 13th annual Ignatz Awards\\".

He previously played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Boston Red Sox, Baltimore Orioles, Atlanta Braves, Oakland Athletics, Pittsburgh Pirates, Cincinnati Reds, and Miami Marlins. In international competition, he has played for Team Israel. Lavarnway attended Yale University, where in 2007 he won the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) batting title by hitting .467 and led the NCAA with an .873 slugging percentage. That year, Lavarnway also set the Ivy League record with a 25-game hitting streak. In addition, he set the Ivy League all-time career home run record, with 33. Lavarnway was drafted by the Red Sox in 2008. In 2009, he led the South Atlantic League with 59 extra-base hits. Next season, he was a Carolina League Mid-Season and Post-Season All Star; additionally, he was named the Red Sox co-Minor League Offensive Player of the Year. In 2011, after Lavarnway hit 30 home runs in 478 minor league at bats, Baseball America named him the best power prospect in the International League. He was also named to their 2011 Minor League All-Star Team, and the Red Sox organization named him co-winner of their Offensive Player of the Year award for the second season in a row. He was called up to the major leagues by the Red Sox in August 2011, making headlines in September when he hit two home runs in his first start as a catcher. Entering the 2012 season Lavarnway was the No. 9 prospect in the Red Sox system according to Baseball America. That season, he was the International League (IL) All Star starting catcher and a post-season IL All- Star. He played 46 games for Boston in 2012, batting .157. He split 2013 between Pawtucket and Boston, batting .299 in 25 games for the major league club. In 2014 with Pawtucket, Lavarnway led the team to the International League title, and was voted MVP of the IL series. However, he was hitless in 10 at bats for Boston, who designated him for assignment after the year. Lavarnway began the 2015 season with the Baltimore Orioles but only played 10 games for them before getting designated for assignment on May 26. Signed by the Atlanta Braves, he served as A. J. Pierzynski's backup starting on June 15; though he spent the rest of the season with Atlanta, he only appeared in 27 games for them. Failing to make the Braves' roster in 2016, he spent most of the season in the minor leagues for the Toronto Blue Jays. Lavarnway received international honors in 2017, getting named Pool A MVP after playing for Team Israel at the 2017 World Baseball Classic. In the major leagues that year, he got into six games with the Oakland Athletics. He was a 2018 mid- season Triple-A All Star for the Nashville Sounds. Called up by the Pittsburgh Pirates at the end of 2018, he had four hits in six at bats. Lavarnway started 2019 in the minor leagues again but was called up by the Reds in July. In his debut for the team on July 19, he became the first Red with six RBIs in his Cincinnati debut since RBIs became a statistic in 1920. However, he only played five games for the Reds before they returned him to the minor leagues. In November 2019, he obtained Israeli citizenship, hoping to play for Team Israel in baseball at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. He signed a minor league contract with the Miami Marlins in December. Early life Lavarnway was born on August 7, 1987 in Burbank, California, but grew up in Woodland Hills, California. Born to a Jewish mother and a Catholic father, Lavarnway celebrated Chanukah growing up but never had a Bar Mitzvah. Starting in high school, Lavarnway began pursuing the Jewish faith more seriously. \\"I felt spiritually attracted and I began to attend synagogue,\\" he said of his high school days. From watching his father play softball games, Lavarnway developed an interest in baseball at a young age. He played catcher in Little League, and his favorite major league player growing up was Jason Varitek. At El Camino Real High School, Lavarnway caught at first but later played outfield for the \\"Conquistadors\\" baseball team as a senior. The team retired his jersey in 2018. College career Lavarnway attended Yale University, where he majored in philosophy and played baseball for the Yale Bulldogs in the Ivy League. Lavarnway chose Yale because \\"obtaining good grades was important and [Yale] had a strong academic reputation,\\" he said. In 2006, he primarily played right field, earning Ivy Player and Rookie of the Week honors that March. In 2007, Lavarnway moved back to catcher. \\"I knew it would provide the best opportunity to reach the major leagues,\\" Lavarnway said, explaining he did not have enough speed in the outfield. He led the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) in batting average (.467) and slugging percentage (.873), setting Yale single-season records in those categories as well as in home runs (14) and runs batted in (RBIs). His 25-game hitting streak set an Ivy League record, and he earned the G.H. Walker, Jr. Award for being the team's Most Valuable Player (MVP). Following the college season, Lavarnway played for the Manchester Silkworms in the New England Collegiate Baseball League in the summer of 2007, batting .313 for the team. He was honored as a starter on the league All Star team, also competing in the home run derby. In 2008, his junior year, Lavarnway was the Ivy League's leader in home runs (13), RBIs (42), walks (29), slugging percentage (.824), and on-base percentage (.541). He also batted .398. He missed the last 11 games of the year after breaking the scaphoid bone in his left wrist while diving into home plate in April. Even though he missed some playing time, Lavarnway set the Ivy League record with 33 home runs during his time at Yale. Lavarnway was a semi- finalist for the Johnny Bench Award and the Golden Spikes Award, in addition to being named Second-Team All-Ivy. In 120 total games for Yale, he had a .384 batting average, 33 home runs, and 122 RBIs. In 2012, Craig Breslow (also Jewish) and Lavarnway became the first Yale players to be Major League teammates since 1949, and the first All-Yale battery in the major leagues since 1883. Lavarnway left the university 11 credits short of graduating, and wants to return to Yale to finish his philosophy degree. Career =Boston Red Sox= 2008‚Äì09 Lavarnway was drafted by the Boston Red Sox in the 6th round of the 2008 Major League Baseball Draft. He signed for a $325,000 signing bonus, though he vowed to later study the extra year he needed to complete his degree. Once projected to be drafted higher, his status had fallen after he broke his left wrist in April 2008, causing him to more strongly consider remaining at Yale for his senior year. He played his first professional baseball for the Lowell Spinners of the Class A short season New York-Penn League, batting .211 with two home runs and nine RBIs in 22 games. In 2009, Lavarnway played for the Greenville Drive in the Class A South Atlantic League, with whom he started using a bigger bat. He hit 21 home runs (a team all-time record) and posted a .540 slugging percentage; in both these categories, he led all Red Sox minor league players. Additionally, he recorded 36 doubles (a team record), a league-leading 59 extra-base hits, and 87 RBIs (second in the league) in 404 at bats. 2010 Lavarnway split 2010 between the Salem Red Sox of the Class A+ Carolina League, and the Portland Sea Dogs of the Class AA Eastern League, combining for 22 home runs (second among Red Sox minor leaguers; his 14 homers in his Carolina League stint led the league), 102 RBIs (first in the Red Sox system, and 11th among all minor leaguers), and a .489 slugging percentage (tops among Red Sox minor leaguers) in 462 at bats. He was a Carolina League Player of the Week (April 19), Mid- Season All Star, and Post-Season All Star. In the Eastern League, he won Player of the Week honors for the week ending August 30. He was leading the league in homers, RBIs, and runs at the time of his promotion. For 2010, he was named the Red Sox co-Minor League Offensive Player of the Year, along with first baseman Anthony Rizzo. He also threw out 33% of attempted base-stealers and was rated as the top Red Sox catching prospect by Baseball America. After the regular season ended, Lavarnway also played for the Peoria Javelinas in the Arizona Fall League (AFL). He was named an \\"AFL Rising Star\\" in November. 2011 Lavarnway started the 2011 season with Portland before getting promoted to the Pawtucket Red Sox in the Class AAA International League on June 13. At Pawtucket, he batted third in the lineup. With Portland, he hit 14 home runs with a .510 slugging percentage in 208 at bats, and with Pawtucket he hit 18 home runs with a .612 slugging percentage in 227 at bats. That was good for a combined total of 30 home runs (tied for fourth-most in the minors) and 93 RBIs in 435 at bats. Lavarnway was voted the International League Player of the Week for the week ending July 25 and received Topps Minor League Player of the Month honors for July. Baseball America named Lavarnway the best power prospect in the International League, and the Red Sox organization named him a co-winner of their Offensive Player of the Year award. Defensively, through mid-August he had made only one error behind the plate. Baseball America named him the catcher on its 2011 Minor League All-Star Team, and MLB.com ranked him the No. 93 prospect in Major League Baseball. Boston Red Sox in 2011 In 2011, former major leaguer Ken Ryan compared Lavarnway to Mike Lieberthal, whose offensive ability was far ahead of his catching ability when he first made it to the major leagues, but who over time established himself as a defensive catcher as well. On August 18, Lavarnway was called up to the Red Sox. He filled the roster spot of Kevin Youkilis, who went on the disabled list. The next day, August 19, he collected his first career hit, a single off of Jeff Francis of the Kansas City Royals. On September 27, with both Jason Varitek and Jarrod Saltalamacchia injured, Lavarnway started for the Red Sox and hit his first two major league home runs, recording four RBIs in a key 8‚Äì7 victory over the Baltimore Orioles. Lavarnway became the third player in major league baseball history to hit two home runs in his first start at catcher, joining Bobby Pfeil (1971) and J. P. Arencibia (2010). In 17 games for Boston in 2011, Lavarnway batted .231 with nine hits, two home runs, and eight RBI. 2012 Entering the 2012 season, Lavarnway was named the No. 9 prospect in the Red Sox system by Baseball America. That season, he was the International League All-Star starting catcher and also a post-season IL All-Star. In 83 games with Pawtucket, he batted .295 with eight home runs and 43 RBI. On August 1, Lavarnway was called up from Pawtucket when Daniel Nava was placed on the 15-day disabled list. He remained with Boston the rest of the season, receiving regular playing time at catcher and also as a designated hitter. With the Red Sox and the Seattle Mariners tied at three runs apiece on September 4, Lavarnway hit a home run against Blake Beavan, providing the margin of victory in a 4‚Äì3 win that snapped a seven-game losing streak for Boston. On September 14, he had four RBIs, including a three-run home run against Aaron Laffey, as the Red Sox defeated the Toronto Blue Jays by a score of 8‚Äì5. Lavarnway played 46 games for the Red Sox in 2012, batting .157 with two home runs and 12 RBI. Though his caught stealing percentage was 32% at Pawtucket, it was 10% with Boston. 2013 Lavarnway catches a pop fly. On March 27, 2013, the Red Sox optioned Lavarnway to Pawtucket. Manager John Farrell said: \\"Right now he needs 'everyday' at-bats.\\" Commenting on Lavarnway having been timed at 1.9 seconds throwing out a runner trying to steal second, Farrell said, \\"More than acceptable at the big league level.\\" Lavarnway was recalled to Boston on April 25 but was optioned back on April 28 to make room for John Lackey's return from the disabled list without having made an appearance. Larvarnway was called up again on May 12 after David Ross was placed on the 7-day disabled list with a concussion. He appeared in three games this time before getting optioned to Pawtucket again on May 24. He was called up for a third time on June 18 after Ross was again placed on the 7-day disabled list with a concussion. On August 6, while catching knuckleballer Steve Wright in his first major league start, Lavarnway tied a Major League record with four passed balls in one inning. The record was set by Ray Katt of the New York Giants in 1954, catching knuckleballer Hoyt Wilhelm, and tied by Gino Petralli of the Texas Rangers in 1987, catching knuckleballer Charlie Hough. Lavarnway was sent back to Pawtucket on August 19 when Ross returned from the disabled list, but it was only for a couple weeks before he was recalled in September as part of September call-ups. Overall in 2013, he batted .299 in 25 regular season games for Boston, with one home run and 14 RBI. With Pawtucket in 2013, he batted .250 with three home runs and 24 RBI. With Pawtucket, he threw out 18 of 45 attempted base stealers (40.0%), the 4th-best percentage among International League catchers. However, he only threw out 19% of would-be base stealers in the major leagues. 2014 In the spring of 2014 Lavarnway was tutored to play first base by infield instructor Brian Butterfield. Lavarnway started the 2014 season in Pawtucket, where he batted .265 with two home runs and 11 RBIs in 44 games before getting recalled by Boston on May 26. He started at first base for the first time in the major leagues on May 29 against the Atlanta Braves but left the game early with left wrist soreness. The next day, he was placed on the 15-day disabled list after an MRI revealed a broken hamate bone in the wrist. He had surgery to remove the hamate bone from his left wrist at the Cleveland Clinic on June 4 and began a rehab assignment with Portland on July 21. Moved up to Pawtucket on July 25, Lavarnway was eventually optioned to Pawtucket, not rejoining the Red Sox until September. With Pawtucket, Lavarnway led the team to the International League title, earning Governor's Cup MVP honors after earning 10 hits in 22 at bats. Promoted by the Red Sox after Pawtucket's season ended, he appeared in five games, either as a pinch-hitter or as a first baseman. In nine games with Boston in 2014, Lavarnway had only 10 at bats, going hitless in them. His totals with Pawtucket were a .283 average, three home runs, and 20 RBIs in 62 games. After the season, he was designated for assignment on November 25. =Baltimore Orioles= The Los Angeles Dodgers claimed Lavarnway off waivers on December 5, 2014. Lavarnway was out of options, and therefore could not be sent to the minor leagues without first clearing waivers. However, he was designated for assignment, then claimed off waivers by the Chicago Cubs on December 19, 2014. Four days later, however, the Cubs also put him on waivers. Lavarnway changed teams again on December 23, when the Baltimore Orioles ‚Äì his fourth team in 18 days ‚Äì claimed him off waivers from the Cubs. Lavarnway was again designated for assignment on January 9. He began the 2015 season on the Orioles' opening day roster. After appearing in only ten games, he was designated for assignment on May 26. Manager Buck Showalter said, \\"I just don't think Ryan's swing and the things that he's capable of doing are conducive to playing once a week,\\" and indicated that he hoped Lavarnway would accept a Norfolk roster position. Instead, Lavarnway became a free agent. He had batted .107 in 10 games for Baltimore, with no home runs or RBIs. =Atlanta Braves= On May 30, 2015, Lavarnway signed a minor league contract with the Atlanta Braves. Playing for the Triple-A Gwinnett Braves, in 49 plate appearances he recorded a .268 batting average/.388 on-base percentage/.463 slugging percentage with two home runs and eight RBIs. After playing 13 games for Gwinnett, he was called up to the majors on June 15 to replace the struggling Christian Bethancourt. With the Braves, he served as A. J. Pierzynski's backup. On July 11, his home run against Jorge de la Rosa accounted for half of Atlanta's scoring in a 3‚Äì2 loss to the Colorado Rockies. In 27 games for Atlanta, he batted .227 with two home runs and six RBIs. He was outrighted off the roster on October 9 but was re-signed to a minor league deal by the organization. Invited to spring training with the Braves in 2016, Lavarnway failed to make the team and played for Gwinnett, batting 276 with no home runs and 10 RBIs in 25 games. Lavarnway was granted his release on May 15, allowing newly-acquired Anthony Recker to get more playing time with Gwinnett. =Toronto Blue Jays= On May 27, 2016, Lavarnway signed a minor league contract with the Toronto Blue Jays and was assigned to the Double-A New Hampshire Fisher Cats. In 66 games for New Hampshire, he batted .262 with six home runs and 38 RBIs. He elected free agency on November 7, 2016. =Oakland Athletics= On November 21, 2016, Lavarnway signed a minor league contract with the Oakland Athletics that included an invitation to spring training. He began the 2017 season playing for the Nashville Sounds of the Triple-A Pacific Coast League. He was called up on July 5, appearing in one game before being sent outright back to Nashville on July 11. His contract was selected by the Athletics on July 27 when Josh Phegley went on the disabled list with an oblique injury. This time, he appeared in five games before being designated for assignment on August 5 after the A's added catcher Dustin Garneau. Lavarnway was outrighted to Nashville two days later. He batted .273 for the Athletics, recording three hits in 11 at bats. In 83 games for Nashville, he batted .239 with six home runs and 26 RBIs. He elected free agency after the season. =Pittsburgh Pirates= On January 22, 2018, Lavarnway signed a minor league deal with the Pittsburgh Pirates. He was invited to spring training.

The name given to this route stems from the Hebrew letter Khet which resembles the shape of the route. The route starts from the Gaza Strip, goes through secret Gaza Strip smuggling tunnels below the Philadelphi Route into Egypt's Sinai Peninsula (where occasionally the militants would receive assistance from Bedouin locals), and from Sinai into Israel through a section of the Israeli‚ÄìEgyptian border which had no security fence. The route was mainly used by Bedouin smugglers, but also by armed militants seeking to carry out terror attacks, some of whom were caught by the Israeli Border Police. On January 29, 2007 (Eilat bakery bombing) and on August 18, 2011 (2011 southern Israel cross-border attacks), terrorist attacks were carried out in southern Israel by perpetrators who got into Israel through this route. In 2013‚Äì2014, under el‚ÄìSisi's regime, the Egyptians took steps to secure the border in the Gaza region in response to the Sinai terror attacks.

The contests continued, with an increasing number and diversity of winning teams, through 2006. In 2007, the contests were suspended because of a decrease in emphasis on microgravity research in the budget, so not enough money was available to continue it, although the amount of money involved was a minuscule fraction of the federal budget. They were resumed in 2009 with the selection of 11 winners (3 Tier III winners were chosen).

The film relays the story of two siblings during an Easter holiday at their family's country house in Sitges; the brother decides to investigate a local urban legend involving the ghost of a missing girl named Melinda. The film was released as part of the Bloody Disgusting Selects line.  Plot  Cristian Quintanilla (Cristian Valencia) and his sister July (Clara Moraleda) have a web-show of paranormal investigations covering urban legends. When they are invited to spend the Easter holidays at the family's summer home, they intend to investigate the story of Melinda, a girl that went missing in 1940 and supposedly haunts the woods. Cristian and July spend a great deal of time wandering around the hedge maze there with their video cameras. Their father reveals that their mother once knew the maze quite well in her youth. Upon finding a well in the maze, Cristian leans into it and calls Melinda's name. July chastises him for being disrespectful. The morning after, their dog goes missing and Cristian and July eventually find him dead at the bottom of the well. That night, the mother enters their room, screaming that their younger brother Jos√© has gone missing. When she and the two children head for the maze to search for him, they are separated. Eventually, Cristian finds July, tied to the pillars of a small gazebo, bleeding profusely. He leads her back to the house, where they find Jos√©'s burnt body in the fireplace. Hearing noises outside, July hides in a kitchen cupboard, while Cristian goes to the front door. An axe blade bursts through the door and Cristian runs upstairs to hide. The next morning, Cristian goes downstairs to find the kitchen cupboard empty and drenched in blood. Down in the basement he finds an old video recorder playing. It is a tape of his mother being interviewed in a mental institution by her doctors. They mention that schizophrenic episodes in adolescent women have a tendency to reoccur, and that night can bring them on. It is established that Cristian and July once had a baby sister named Michelle and that their mother had a psychotic break as the result of postpartum depression and killed her. The mother blames the episodes on a woman named Elvira, about whom the doctors question her. As Cristian watches this tape, his mother comes up behind him and slaughters him with an axe. Five days later, the police find the bodies of the Quintanilla family and recover the video footage shot by Cristian and July.  Reception  The film has received mixed reviews, with Rotten Tomatoes listing 18 reviews, 56% of which are favorable.

It was launched in May 2010 by the private company GroupMe. In August 2011, GroupMe delivered over 100 million messages each month and by June 2012, that number jumped to 550 million. In 2013, GroupMe had over 12 million registered users.  History  GroupMe was conceived at TechCrunch Disrupt 2010. Founders Jared Hecht and Steve Martocci raised US$10.6 million in venture capital from Khosla Ventures, General Catalyst Partners, angel investors, and others. In August 2011, Skype acquired the one-year-old start-up for around $80 million. Skype had itself been purchased by Microsoft in May 2011, with the purchase finalized in October 2011. The app underwent a redesign in late 2012. Initially, groups were limited to 100 members, but a support request could get a groups limit raised as high as necessary as it approached the limit. In 2019, GroupMe stopped offering group member limit increases, however they increased the standard limit from 100 to 500.  Usage  GroupMe works by downloading the app or accessing the service online, and then forming an account by providing your name, cell phone number and a password, or you can connect through your Facebook or Twitter account. The service then syncs with your contacts and from that point forward the user can make groups, limited to 500 members. An individual who is part of an active group has the ability to turn off notifications for the app; users will still receive the message, but will not be notified about it. Each group is given a label and assigned a unique number. Some of the features of the app include the ability to share photos, videos, locations, create events, and emojis from various packs. GroupMe has a web client as well as apps for iOS, Android, Windows Phone, and Windows 10. Those who do not wish to use the app can still send and receive GroupMe messages through SMS (only available in the United States). Users begin by creating a ‚Äúgroup‚Äù and adding contacts. When someone sends a message, everyone in the group can see and respond to it. The app allows users to easily attach and send pictures, documents, videos and web-links as well. Users can also send private messages, but only to users who are also active on the GroupMe app. GroupMe has been used been used as a means for studying the usage of messaging clients in educational settings. Use cases include facilitating online course discussions, small group work, and other course communications for both in-person and online sections. Though unconventional, using GroupMe to facilitate discussion in an environment where students already interact has been found to encourage rhetorical thinking and overall engagement. Researchers have found alternatives for literacy learning as a \\"legitimate academic genre\\", given a student population that communicates in variety of modes. Research around GroupMe furthers the argument that computer-mediated communication is a valuable space for learning in an increasingly globalized society.

Background  The National Association of Professional Base Ball Players was the first professional baseball organization. It operated from 1871 until 1875. Whether to treat it as a major league has been a contentious issue in baseball historiography and statistics, because the major leagues utterly dominate not only publication but thinking, talking, and writing about the history of the game on the field. The careers of players and field managers as participants, of clubs, and even cities, as competitors are all viewed through the prism of what was accomplished during their major league careers. For example, it is routine to say that a player's career began when he first appeared in a major league game. Players retire from baseball when they last appeared in a major league game. A player will have \\"played baseball for two seasons\\" if he appeared in major league games during two calendar years -- whether he played two games in emergencies, recruited from the fans in attendance, or two full seasons during a professional career of twenty years.  The controversy  In 1969, Major League Baseball's newly formed Special Baseball Records Committee decided that the National Association should be excluded from major league status, citing the association's \\"erratic schedule and procedures\\" as well as a history of gambling and \\"poor newspaper coverage\\".Paul D. Staudohar, The Business of Professional Baseball (University of Illinois Press, 1991), , p. 98. Excerpts available at Google Books. Thus, when the landmark 1969 Macmillan Baseball Encyclopedia was published, National Association records were not included in totals for such early stars as Cap Anson. Arguments against including the NA as a major league generally revolve around the league's quality of play, significant differences in the sport's rules during the era, and the instability of the league (as many teams lasted only one season or part of a season), and the poor state of the NA records. The Special Baseball Records Committee's decision has faced continuing criticism. Oft-cited arguments in favor of the National Association are its status as the first fully professional baseball league, the fact that several of its teams continued on as part of the National League when it was founded in 1876, and the much more complete state of National Association records today than they were in 1969, thanks to research efforts by a number of baseball historians. In 1982, Sports Illustrated writer Marc Onigman argued that the NA should be included in the major leagues, despite its acknowledged flaws, pointing out the same flaws existed in other leagues as well, and called the Committee's decision \\"a modern-day value judgment that doesn't hold up\\".Marc Onigman, \\"The National Association Should Be In The Major Leagues, Warts And All\\", Sports Illustrated, May 24, 1982. The committee's decision has been criticized for favoring the owner-run National League over the player-dominated National Association.\\"Numbers game draws heated criticism from Voigt\\", Reading Eagle, April 1, 1984. David Nemec's The Great Encyclopedia of Nineteenth-Century Major League Baseball includes players' National Association statistics in their major league totals; Nemec states that his compendium \\"is not bound by major league baseball's decision to treat its statistics separately\\", points out that \\"the National Association contained most of the best professional players of its time\\", and also argues that the National Association is more entitled to major league status than the 1884 Union Association.David Nemec, The Great Encyclopedia of Nineteenth-Century Major League Baseball (University of Alabama Press, 2006), , p. 865. Excerpts available at Google Books. The editors of The 2007 ESPN Baseball Encyclopedia also registered their disagreement with the NA's exclusion, arguing that the NA \\"was indisputably the Major League Baseball of its day\\", but they nevertheless decided not to combine their NA records with later leagues, to avoid confusing conflicts with totals shown in the \\"official records\\".Gary Gillette and Pete Palmer, The 2007 ESPN Baseball Encyclopedia (Sterling Publishing, 2007), , p. x.

The molecule acts as an anti-inflammatory agent by disrupting the first step of the arachidonic acid pathway of inflammation. From 2006 to 2012, varespladib was under active investigation by Anthera Pharmaceuticals as a potential therapy for several inflammatory diseases, including acute coronary syndrome and acute chest syndrome. The trial was halted in March 2012 due to inadequate efficacy. The selective sPLA2 inhibitor varespladib (IC50 value 0.009 ¬µM in chromogenic assay, mole fraction 7.3X10-6) was studied in the VISTA-16 randomized clinical trial (clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01130246) and the results were published in 2014. The sPLA2 inhibition by varespladib in this setting seemed to be potentially harmful, and thus not a useful strategy for reducing adverse cardiovascular outcomes from acute coronary syndrome. Since 2016, scientific research has focused on the use of Varespladib as an inhibitor of snake venom toxins using various types of in vitro and in vivo models. Varespladib showed a significant inhibitory effect to snake venom PLA‚ÇÇ which makes it a potential first-line drug candidate in snakebite envenomation therapy. In 2019, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted varespladib orphan drug status for its potential to treat snakebite. Oral varespladib Intravenous varespladib Varespladib sodium (also known as A-001, previously LY315920 and S-5920) is a sodium salt of varespladib designed for intravenous delivery. It was under evaluation by Anthera Pharmaceuticals as an anti-inflammatory sPLA2 inhibitor for the prevention of acute chest syndrome (ACS), the leading cause of death for patients with sickle-cell disease. Elevated serum levels of sPLA2 have been observed in sickle-cell patients preceding and during ACS episodes. This profound elevation in sPLA2 levels is not observed in sickle-cell patients at steady-state or during a vaso-occlusive crisis, or in patients with respiratory diseases such as pneumonia. A reduction in serum sPLA2 levels, for example through blood transfusion, reduces the risk of an ACS, suggesting that sPLA2 plays an important role in the onset of ACS. Anthera Pharmaceuticals acquired varespladib sodium from Lilly and Shionogi in 2006. In 2007, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted varespladib sodium orphan drug status for its potential to treat patients with sickle-cell disease, which was later withdrawn. In 2009, Anthera Pharmaceuticals completed a Phase II study of varespladib sodium in subjects with sickle cell disease at risk for ACS. Inhibitory effect on snake venoms Snakebite envenomation can cause local tissue damage, with edema, hemorrhage, myonecrosis, and systemic toxic responses, including organ failure. In an early report on inhibition of snake venom toxicities, Varespladib, and its orally bioavailable prodrug methyl- varespladib (LY333013) showed strong inhibition of 28 types of svPLA2s from six continents. Varespladib treatment exerted a significant inhibitory effect on snake venom PLA‚ÇÇ both in vitro and in vivo. Hemorrhage and myonecrosis initiated by D. acuts, A. halys, N. atra, and B. multicinctus in an animal model were significantly reversed by varespladib. Furthermore, edema in gastrocnemius muscle was also attenuated. The sPLA2 inhibitor, LY315920 (varespladib sodium), and its orally bioavailable prodrug, LY333013 (varespladib methyl) were highly effective in preventing lethality following experimental envenoming by M. fulvius in a porcine animal model. Considering that some of the toxins of snake venoms are enzymes, the search for low molecular weight enzyme inhibitors that could be safely administered immediately after a snakebite re-focused scientists' attention on Varespladib. Its ability to neutralize the enzymatic and toxic activities of three isolated PLA2 toxins (from medically important snakes found in diÔ¨Äerent region around the world) of structural groups I (pseudexin) and II (crotoxin B and myotoxin I) was evaluated. The results obtained showed that Varespladib was able to neutralize the in vitro cytotoxic and in vivo myotoxic activities of puriÔ¨Åed PLA2s of both the structural group I (pseudexin) and II (myotoxin-I and crotoxin B), however further detailed analysis are needed. Varespladib also effectively inhibited the non-enzymatic myotoxic activity of the snake venom PLA2-like protein (MjTX-II). Co-crystallization of Varespladib with MjTX-II toxin revealed that the compound binds to a hydrophobic channel of the protein. Such interaction blocks fatty acids binding, thus inhibiting allosteric activation of the toxin. This leads to the toxin losing its ability to disrupt cell membranes. In 2019, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted varespladib orphan drug status for its potential to treat snakebite.

The NBRC is the only organization in the United States which develops certification examinations for Registered Respiratory Therapists (RRTs) and Certified Respiratory Therapists (CRTs). The NBRC also offers additional specialization credentialing for respiratory practitioners that hold its certifications. The CRT and RRT designations are the standard credential in respiratory care for licensure requirements in the portions of the United States that have enacted a Respiratory Care Act. States that license respiratory therapists sometimes require the practitioner to maintain their NBRC credentialing to maintain their license to practice. The NBRC is headquartered in Overland Park, Kansas. It has been in the Kansas City metropolitan area since 1974. The NBRC is located at 10801 Mastin St, Suite 300, Overland Park, KS 66210. Certification levels =Entry level certification= Certification is the entry level and is separated as such by the NBRC. Certified Respiratory Therapists and Certified Pulmonary Function Technologists may require oversight and supervision by their advanced-practice counterparts. =Advanced practice certification= The term the NBRC uses to designate an advanced practitioner is \\"registered\\" and the addition to an advanced practitioner registry which is not permanent but has a re-certification fee associated with it. Registered Respiratory Therapist and Registered Pulmonary Function Technologist are currently the advanced credentialings maintained by the NBRC. =Specialties= The NBRC has sub-specialties for the Respiratory Therapist designations. Both the CRT and the RRT are eligible to sit for additional credentialing but the CRT still requires the same supervision by the RRT in clinical applications. * Sleep Disorders Specialist ‚Äî The sleep disorder specialist (RRT-SDS or CRT-SDS) is a credential recognized by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine for the role of Scoring in sleep studies. * Neonatal & Pediatric Specialist ‚Äî The neonatal and pediatric specialist (RRT-NPS or CRT-NPS) is a respiratory therapist that may work in advanced care in pediatrics and neonatology centers and units. * Adult Critical Care Specialist ‚Äî The adult critical care specialist is only available to the RRT (RRT-ACCS) that is a pulmonary and hemodymanic specialist in intensive medicine in adult practice. Testing NBRC examinations are developed by NBRC staff and administered by AMP, a PSI business. =Examinations maintained by the NBRC= Candidates must have a minimum of an associate degree from a respiratory therapy education program supported by the Committee on Accreditation for Respiratory Care (CoARC) to be eligible for the TMC Examination. Credentialed practitioners may then apply for state licensure. Respiratory Therapist * NBRC-TMC ‚Äî The Therapist Multiple-Choice Examination (TMC) is designed to objectively measure essential knowledge, skills, and abilities required of entry-level respiratory therapists, as well as determine eligibility for the Clinical Simulation Examination. There are two established cut scores for the Therapist Multiple-Choice Examination. If a candidate achieves the lower cut score, he or she will earn the CRT credential. If a candidate achieves the higher cut score, he or she will earn the CRT credential AND become eligible for the Clinical Simulation Examination (provided that those eligibility requirements are met and the candidate is eligible to earn the RRT credential). Candidate must be 18 years old and must have either: a minimum of an associate degree from a respiratory therapist education program accredited by the Commission on Accreditation for Respiratory Care (CoARC), or hold the Canadian Society of Respiratory Therapists (CSRT) RRT credential. The TMC consists of 160 multiple-choice questions (140 scored items and 20 pretest items) distributed among three major content areas: Patient Data Evaluation and Recommendations, Troubleshooting and Quality Control of Equipment and Infection Control, and Initiation and Modification of Interventions. Candidates are given three hours to complete the TMC Examination. * NBRC-CSE ‚Äî The Clinical Simulation Examination (CSE) is a test in which the test-taker accepts the role as an autonomous respiratory therapist handling all sorts of intervention and therapy. Candidates that pass both the NBRC-TMC at the higher cut score and the NBRC-CSE will earn the RRT credential. CSE lasts 4 hours and consists of 22 separate patient management problems (20 scored and 2 pretest) designed to simulate the clinical practice of respiratory care. Specialization of the Respiratory Therapist * NBRC-SDS ‚Äî The Sleep Disorders Specialty Examination program is designed specifically for a respiratory therapist with an NBRC respiratory care credential and experience or education in the field of sleep medicine. Those who are actively certified as a Sleep Disorders Specialist are permitted to use the post-nominal letters \\"SDS\\", \\"RRT-SDS\\" or \\"CRT-SDS\\" depending on their level and preference. * NBRC-ACCS ‚Äî The Adult Critical Care Specialty Examination program is designed specifically for a respiratory therapist with the RRT credential and experience in the field of adult critical care. Those who are actively certified as a Respiratory Care Adult Critical Care Specialist are permitted to use the post-nominal letters \\"ACCS\\" or \\"RRT-ACCS\\" depending on their preference. * NBRC-NPS ‚Äî The Neonatal/Pediatric Respiratory Care Specialty Examination is designed specifically for a respiratory therapist with an NBRC respiratory care credential and experience in the field of neonatal/pediatric care. Those who are actively certified as a Neonatal/Pediatric Specialist are permitted to use the post-nominal letters \\"NPS\\", \\"RRT-NPS\\" or \\"CRT-NPS\\" depending on their level and preference. Pulmonary Function Technologist * NBRC-PFT - The Pulmonary Function Technologist Examination is designed to objectively measure essential knowledge, skills, and abilities required of pulmonary function technologists. There are two established cut scores for the Pulmonary Function Technologist Examination. If a candidate achieves the lower cut score, he or she will earn the Certified Pulmonary Function Technologist (CPFT) credential. If a candidate achieves the higher cut score, he or she will earn the Registered Pulmonary Function Technologist (RPFT) credential.

Family They were the sons of Giovanni Antonio Galignani (1757‚Äì1821), by Anne Parsons (1776‚Äì1822). The name is probably derived from the village of Gallignano, near Cremona, and Giovanni was a native of Brescia. There is a tradition that the father was originally a courier. In 1793 he taught Italian, German, and English at Paris. He thence removed to London, where in 1796 he published twenty-four lectures on a new method of learning Italian without grammar or dictionary. A second edition of this work was issued by Montucci in 1806. Galignani apparently married in London, and his two sons were born there, the elder on 13 October 1796, the younger on 10 March 1798. Shortly after William's birth he returned to Paris, where he and his wife offered linguistic breakfasts and teas to persons desirous of mastering English or Italian, but for the latter language there appears to have been little demand, and 'Mrs. Parsons-Galignani' established an English bookshop and circulating library. In 1801 the Galignanis started a monthly (in 1817 it became a weekly) 'Repertory of English Literature.' A third son, Charles Alphonse, was born at Paris in 1811; he died at Geneva in 1829. On the fall of Napoleon in 1814 the father commenced issuing guide-books and founded 'Galignani's Messenger,' which was at first a tri-weekly but speedily became a daily paper, and circulated among English residents all over Europe, as the stamp duty and postage rendered London journals expensive. In 1815 he published a Paris guide in English and German, on opposite pages, for the use of officers of the allied troops. Reprinting business and bookshop The elder son, while still under age, opened a bookshop at Cambrai, but returned to Paris at or before his father's death, when he became the chief partner. The two brothers issued reprints of many English books, sometimes paying authors for advance-sheets. Sir Walter Scott, for instance, on visiting what he calls the 'old pirate's den' in 1826, was, 'after some palaver,' offered a hundred guineas for sheets of his 'Life of Napoleon.' The 'den' was at the bottom of a court, 18 rue Vivienne, and though so central, a garden with large trees was attached to it. It served as a club for English residents and visitors, who paid six francs a month, the reading room containing English and continental newspapers and eighteen thousand books. Both brothers obtained denizenship in December 1830, and in 1832 William was naturalised, Anthony (he had dropped his first name) remaining a British subject. In 1838 Thackeray, then in Paris, wrote for the 'Messenger.' Philanthropy In 1852 the copyright treaty put a stop to Galignani's reprints, and in 1855 the establishment was removed to the rue de Rivoli. A flourishing business and investments in house property brought the brothers a large fortune, of which they made a munificent use. Having a country house at √âtiolles, of which parish William was for more than twenty years mayor, they presented the adjoining town of Corbeil with a hospital and extensive grounds. They were also liberal contributors to British charities in Paris, and erected at Neuilly a hospital for indigent English (now converted into an orphanage). In 1866 the British government presented them with a silver epergne in recognition of their benevolent efforts. Anthony, who was unmarried, died 29 Dec. 1873, and William, a widower since 1862, without issue, died 11 Dec. 1882. The elder was knight and the younger officer of the Legion of Honour. The latter bequeathed a site and funds for the erection at Neuilly of the 'Retraite Galignani freres' for a hundred inmates, fifty of them to pay five hundred francs yearly for their maintenance, the other fifty to be admitted gratuitously and to comprise ten booksellers or printers, twenty savants, and ten authors or artists, or parents, widows, or daughters of such. The aggregate benefactions of the brothers amount to between five and six million francs. A fine sculpture of them, by Chapu, has been erected at Corbeil. \\"Upon his death in 1882, William Galignani left the company to his nephew, Charles Jeancourt-Galignani.\\" See also *List of works by Henri Chapu References Further reading * =Galignani's guides= * + index   . + 1837 ed, 1839  1841, 1846  1851  1874, 1877 ed. * . + 1889 ed. 1796 births 1873 deaths John Anthony ","title":"John Anthony Galignani"},{"id":"32790636","text":"The South Tar River Greenway is a greenway located in Greenville, North Carolina.

The southeast terminus trailhead is located at Greensprings Park. This greenway is the second in the city, after the Green Mill Run Greenway. The $1,488,000 project is funded from the Federal Highway Administration budget through its inclusion in the Federal FY2005 Appropriations Act. Completed sections =Phase I= Phase I was approved on December 8, 2008 by the Greenville City Council. Groundbreaking occurred on December 12, 2008 and it opened to the public on December 4, 2009. The greenway segment begins at the Town Common and follows the Tar River to North Warren Street, at the Off Leash Dog Park. It created a long wide asphalt trail from North Holly Street to North Jarvis Street. It then uses the sidewalk on Willow Street for one block. It continues as a wide greenway for from North Woodlawn Street to North Warren Street. The expenditure for this phase was $404,069.73. =Phase II= Phase II groundbreaking occurred in July 2010 and it officially opened to the public on June 11, 2011. The northwest terminus of the segment is located at the Dog Park at North Warren Street, which is the terminus of Phase I. It continues eastward along the southern bank of the Tar River to the confluence of the Tar River and Green Mill Run. Known as Lookout Point, this an area on the bank to view the Tar River and Green Mill Run. It then turns in a southerly direction alongside the western bank of Green Mill Run. It crosses over East Fifth Street and the southeastern trailhead is located in Greensprings Park. Phase II intersects with Green Mill Run Greenway. Future =Phase III= Phase III of the project is to begin in August 2011. The new section will start at the Town Common and follow a westward track to First Street Place apartment complex. Construction of this $125,000 phase should conclude in September 2011. On August 11, 2011, United States Secretary of Transportation Ray LaHood and Senator Kay Hagan announced Greenville will receive $907,609 to design and construct the next phase of the greenway. This phase will connect Phase III to Moye Boulevard at Pitt County Memorial Hospital and The Brody School of Medicine. The extension give an alternative route to reach the cities two largest employers, East Carolina University and Pitt County Memorial Hospital, by alternative transportation. This phase will also be the first section located in West Greenville. Design should take approximately eight months, with construction beginning in 2012. It is also proposed that the greenway will extend eastward to Eastside Park. This phase western terminus will be around Lookout Point. The greenway extension will also connect the eastern Greenville neighborhoods and student apartments to the greenway system. Once this phase is completed, this greenway will be over long and stretch across Greenville. It will be part of the proposed Washington-Greenville Greenway, that will connect the waterfront in Washington to the South Tar River Greenway. The greenway will also be part of the Historic Coastal route, an alternative route on the East Coast Greenway (ECG). The Historic Coastal route will connect the Tidewater region of Virginia to Elizabeth City and Greenville, then to New Bern and Jacksonville, until it rejoins the spine in Wilmington.

It was the 25 edition of the European Dressage Championships, in the 24th time team medals were awarded.  Organization  = Before the event = At the 2008 FEI-General Assembly in Buenos Aires, the Netherlands was chosen as the country to host the 2011 European Dressage Championship. Rotterdam, location of the annual Nations Cup horse show in Show Jumping and Dressage, was chosen as the location for the event. It was the second time in European Dressage Championship history - after 1999 in Arnhem - that the Netherlands was chosen to hold this sports event. = Event and location = The European Dressage Championship was opened in late afternoon on Wednesday, August 17. The sport at the Championship had started on Wednesday morning. Parallel to the European Championships, a Youth Horse Show for riders up to 25 years of age and national dressage competitions was held. At the end of the event there was a short final ceremony on Sunday (August 21, 2011 at 4:45 pm). Three days after the end of the European Dressage Championship the 2011 CHIO Rotterdam was held - this year without dressage. The event was held in Kralingen, a district of Rotterdam, on the CHIO area between the Kralingseweg and the park Kralingse Bos.

It is an active parish church in the Diocese of Blackburn and the archdeaconry of Lancaster. Halton may have been the site of an ancient Anglo-Saxon minster. Of the current structure, the tower dates from the 16th century and the remainder was built 1876‚Äì77 by Paley and Austin. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. History At the time of the Norman conquest of England in 1066, Halton was the centre of a large manor that belonged to Earl Tostig Godwinson. There is evidence of a Christian site at Halton and there was probably an Anglo-Saxon minster there. There may have been a connection to Bishop Wilfrid (c. 633 ‚Äì c. 709) and certainly by 1252, there was a church dedicated to St Wilfrid. Until the early 18th century, the advowson (the right to appoint a parish priest) belonged to the Lord of the Manor. A tower was built in the 16th century. The church (excluding the tower) was rebuilt in 1792. The current structure was built 1876‚Äì77 by Lancaster-based architecture firm Paley and Austin. The 16th-century tower remains. The churchyard was enlarged in 1872, 1901 and again in 1907. Architecture =Exterior= St Wilfrid's is constructed of yellow sandstone rubble and has red tile roofs. Its plan consists of a nave, with a tower to the west, north aisle and chancel to the east. There is a two-storey porch on the south side of the nave, with timber framing to the upper storey. The three-stage tower is tall. The west corners have five-stage diagonal buttresses. It has a crenellated parapet with pinnacles. At the north-east corner there is a vice (spiral stair). There are two-light belfry louvres with hood moulding. The windows in the south walls are in the Decorated style. There is varying tracery. =Interior and fittings= Internally, the tower measures square. It has a ring of three bells. Inside the tower there are some remains of Anglo Saxon sculpture. The nave measures by . It is accessed from the tower through a segmental arch with a single chamfered order. The nave has four bays. The chancel measures by . It contains an organ chamber and a vestry. Stained glass in the church includes images of Joan of Arc and Saint George by Lancaster-based firm Shrigley and Hunt. There is a baptismal font dating from 1848. Churchyard Anglo Saxon high cross The churchyard surrounds the church, particularly to the south and east. There are sandstone gates and gate piers that date from the late 18th century. A lychgate dates from 1907. To the north, there is a two-tiered burial vault built into a hill, with the remains of the Bradshaw family. South of the church lies an Anglo Saxon high cross. The cross is carved sandstone and consists of a base, measuring by , with a shaft and cross head. 11th- century carvings on the shaft depict the legend of Sigurd. Approximately south-east of the porch there is a 17th-century sundial. The base is sandstone and is inscribed with \\"For Saint Wilfrite Church at Halton 1635. Pereunt et imputantur\\". Assessment and administration St Wilfrid's was designated as a Grade II listed building on 4 October 1967. The Grade II designation is the lowest of the three grades. Architectural historians Pevsner and Hartwell (2009) say that the church is \\"easily recognizable\\" as the work of Paley and Austin. The 18th-century gates and piers and the sundial have received separate Grade II designations. The high cross has been designated a scheduled monument as a \\"good example of 11th century art styles\\". St Wilfrid's is an active parish church in the Anglican Diocese of Blackburn, which is part of the Province of York. It is in the archdeaconry of Lancaster and the Deanery of Tunstall. St Wilfrid's shares a benefice with St Saviour's Church in Aughton and St Luke's Church in Slyne-with-Hest.

An industrial expansion in the latter half of the 19th century transformed the society on many levels and initiated the evolution of a broad export-oriented engineering industry with companies such as LM Ericsson, Asea, Alfa Laval, Aga, Electrolux, SKF and Volvo reaching well established positions on the global market and becoming drivers of GDP growth. In addition to engineering, the pulp and paper, steel, and chemical industries developed to reach international prominence. By the 1970s, Sweden had become one of the wealthiest nations of the world. The growth slowed down during the following decades, which were characterized by public deficits and structural change.  Agricultural revolution and protoindustrialization (1790‚Äì1815)  During the period 1790-1815 Sweden experienced two parallel economic movements: an agricultural revolution with larger agricultural estates (land reclamation - Enclosure Act of Sweden), the crown transferring areas to private farmers, new crops and farming tools and a commercialization of farming, and a protoindustrialisation, with small industries being established in the countryside and with workers switching between agricultural work in the summer season and industrial production in the winter season. This led to economic growth benefiting large sections of the population and leading up to a consumption revolution starting in the 1820s. It also led to rapid demographic increase. The early division of labor resulted in household handicraft being largely restricted to the region's natural geographic resource. The \\"town economic policy\\" of the 17th century banned rural trade for the purpose of drawing a clear line between the urban and rural economics. Craft and industrial production were regarded as urban source of livelihood, therefore centralized manufacturing were preferred. This thus paved way to the first industrial revolution of Sweden in the early 19th century.  Early Industrialization, regional specialization and institutional changes (1815‚Äì1850)  In the period 1815-1850 the protoindustries developed into more specialized and larger industries. This period witnessed increasing regional specialization with mining in Bergslagen, textile mills in Sjuh√§radsbygden and forestry in Norrland. Several important institutional changes took place in this period, such as free and mandatory public schooling introduced 1842 (as the first country in the world), the abolishment of a previous national monopoly on trade in handicrafts - the skr√•v√§sendet - in 1846, and a stock company law in 1848. \\"First\\" Industrial Revolution; Export growth, railroads and investment take off (1850‚Äì1890)  During the period 1850-1890 Sweden witnessed a veritable explosion in its export sector, with agricultural crops, wood and steel being the three dominating categories. Important institutional changes in this period included the abolishment of most tariffs and other barriers to free trade in the 1850s and the introduction of the gold standard in 1873, linking the Swedish krona at a fixed parity to gold. These institutional changes helped the expansion of free trade. During this period Sweden's investment quota (investments/GDP) went from 5% to 10%, called take off. During this period modern economic growth, with yearly GDP growth of around 2% made its advent in Sweden. Large infrastructural investments were made during this period, mainly in the expanding rail road network, which was financed in part by the government and in part by private enterprises.  Second industrial revolution (1890‚Äì1950)  During the period 1890-1930 the Second industrial revolution took place in Sweden. During this period new industries developed, with their focus on the domestic market: mechanical engineering, power utilities, paper making and textile industries. The rapid expansion of these industries was clearly helped by the existence of a well functioning risk capital market: the Stockholm Stock Exchange was established in 1866, the Bank of Sweden (founded in 1668 as the first central bank in the world) in 1897 was given legal rights as the sole issuer of bank notes in Sweden and given status as lender of last resort, this making it easier to establish small independent private commercial banks, leading to a rapid expansion in the number of private banks and also to a rapid credit expansion. The private banks issued loans to start-up companies, with stocks as security. As the company was in business and showing positive business figures, the stocks were sold on the stock market, enabling the bank to lend the money to other start-up companies. The rapid credit expansion led to bank tragedy in 1907, as well as a property market collapse. Having imported vast amounts of foreign capital to finance its industrialization, during a 60-year period, from 1850 to 1910, Sweden was probably one of the leading debtor nations in the world by 1910. This situation would change rapidly in the coming decade. In 1914 the First World War commenced and international demand for Swedish exports of strategically important products such as steel, to be used in the armaments industry, increased rapidly. The warring nations had imposed severe limitations on trade between each other, as a neutral country, Sweden was not affected by these restrictions. The warring nations, such as the UK, to a large extent used the printing of new money as a means of financing the war, leading to inflation and thus causing the prices for Swedish exports to rise rapidly. The massive transfers of foreign money as payments for wartime Swedish exports meant that Sweden went from having been one of the most indebted nations in the world before the war, to being a net creditor after the war.  Historical statistics  =Wealth inequality= A 2017 study found that Sweden had lower levels of inequality than other Western European states in 1750 but that the levels converged with those of other European states to become roughly the same by 1900.

He was a prolific choreographer and teacher.McDonagh (1971), p. 215 He has been called \\"one of the most influential figures in the New York avant-garde in the late fifties and early sixties\\",Vaughan, David. \\"James Waring: A Rememberence\\". Performing Arts Journal v.5 n.2 (1981) abstract \\"one of dance's great eccentrics\\", \\"a focal point for dance experimentation before the existence of the Judson Dance Theater\\",McDonagh (1971) quoted in Chin (2010) and \\"the quintessential Greenwich Village choreographer in the late 1950s and 1960s\\".Chin (2010) Waring's collage style of building dance works influenced the development of the avant-garde Happenings which were staged in the late 1950s. According to Leslie Satin, although Waring was a seminal influence on modern and post-modern dance in New York City, his position in both the mainstream and the avant-garde was somewhat tentative, primarily because of the fluidity of Waring's style and the variety of his interests, which sometimes cut against the grain of both worlds. His use of \\"low\\" material from the popular arts also worked against his reputation in both contexts.Satin (2003), pp.63-64 Life and career Waring's training began in 1939 in San Francisco and Oakland at the age of 17. He was exposed to numerous kinds of dancing, including ballet at the San Francisco Ballet School with Harold Christensen and his brother, the Graham technique with Gertrude Schurr, and the interpretive dance of Raoul Paus√©.McDonagh (1971), p. 216Satin (2003), p.55 Later, after serving in the Army in World War II, he studied in New York City at the School of American Ballet, and with Anna Halprin, Louis Horst, Antony Tudor, and Anatole Vilzak, and also took some classes with Merce Cunningham.Personal correspondence with David Vaughan, Cunningham's archivist (7/9/2013) Waring was very attracted to ballet and intrigued by its complex history and sensibility, and dance historian David Vaughan suggests that Waring's extensive knowledge of dance history played an important role in his work; Waring's dances became more balletic over time.Satin (2003), pp.55-56 In 1946, Waring presented the first of the over 135 original works he would create over the course of his career, \\"Luther Burbank in Santa Rosa\\", at the Halprin-Lathrop Studio Theater. Other works he showed during this period were based on or influenced by Japanese Noh drama, the work of Edgar Allan Poe and primitive art, as well as the ballets of George Balanchine and the dancing of Alexandra Danilova, taking from these sources what interested him and mixing them together. The style of his dances varied according to the time and his interests, and could be formal and abstract or theatrical and romantic, influenced not only by the choreography of the moment, but also by the theatricality of the past: vaudeville and the music hall, commedia dell'arte and the circus, and both musical and silent films all played a part in Waring's work.Satin (2003), p.64In fact, Waring said \\"The only dance by Doris Humphrey I ever really liked was The Life of the Bee, and I suspect the reason that I liked it was that it reminded me a little of Radio City Music Hall.\\" Satin (2003), p.51 The question then arises if Waring's choreographic collages were simply a pastiche of their original sources, or if he had indeed created something new and different from the raw material they provided; was his work \\"camp\\", poetic, or postmodern?Satin (2003), pp.52-53 Even people who liked Waring's work - including dancers he had taught and influenced - disagreed with each other about whether his pieces were a \\"mishmash\\" or not.Satin (2003), p.63 Waring was among a group of choreographers and dancers in New York who, in 1951, created Dance Associates, a co-operative which included Aileen Passloff, Tanaquil Le Clercq from the New York City Ballet, Marian Sarach, Paul Taylor, David Vaughn, dance writer Edward Denby, actor Alix Rubin and others. Although Dance Associates garnered a significant amount of work, its annual concerts at the Amato Opera House were not critically successful, and did not draw a significant audience, even though they were free.Satin (2003), pp.59-60 In 1954, Waring began presenting works with his own company in annual concerts, continuing to do so until 1969. He also choreographed for other companies and performers, including Manhattan Festival Ballet - which he was instrumental in founding, the Netherlands Dance Theater, the Pennsylvania Ballet, as well as Toby Armour's New England Dinosaur, the companies of Raymond Johnson, Ze'eva Cohen, and Violette Verdy, and the 5 x 2 Company of Bruce Becker and Jane Kosminsky. He disbanded his company in 1975, shortly before his death, but, in 1974, his male dancers formed Les Ballets Trockadero de Monte Carlo, a travesty dance ensemble in which the men perform as ballerinas. Notable among Waring's works were Phrases (1955), Dances before the Wall (1958), Dromenon (1961), Variations on a Landscape, Sinfonia semplice, and Amoretti.Satin (2003), pp.67-72Jones, LeRoi (1962) \\"James Waring and Dance Company\\" Floating Bear no.19 in Mimeo Mimeo: Artists' Books, Typography, and the Mimeo Revolution #8 The critic Don McDonagh called Waring's At the Caf√© Fleurette (1968), which was performed in the style of the turn of the 20th century, a \\"small masterpiece\\", and pointed out that Waring was fond of absurd titles such as Pumpernickle and Circumstance and Tomato Expos√©. Other titles included Burlesca (1953), Little Kootch Piece (1955), and The Cobra Ballet (1970).Satin (2003), pp.64-66 Waring's Imperceptible Elongation No. 1, which he referred to as a \\"Happening\\", was five seconds long,Satin (2003), p.65 but his At the Hallelujah Gardens (1963) was a spectacle which included \\"a white balloon tree, live geese, and potatoes, and intermittent dance sequences and events: a piece that 'overran its bounds in all directions'.\\" It was set to any music that was \\"big, classical, and perversely overwhelming.\\"Satin (2003), p.65, quoting Marks, Marcia (March 1963) \\"At the Hallelujah Gardens\\" (review) Dance Magazine p.59 Numerous dancers who went on to prominence danced in Waring's company, including Toby Armour, Joan Baker, Richard Colton, Arlene Rothlein, and Ruth Sobotka. Later dancers who would go on to found the Judson Dance Theater and create postmodern dance studied with Waring or danced in his company, including Lucinda Childs, David Gordon, Sally Gross, Deborah Hay, Fred Herko, Gretchen MacLane, Michael Mao, Meredith Monk, Yvonne Rainer, and Valda Setterfield.Satin (2003), p.52 Aside from the dancers who passed through his pieces and classes in New York City, others were influenced by Waring during the 10 years he spent teaching at Indian Hill, which was a summer arts camp in Stockbridge, Massachusetts.Satin (2003), p.69 In 1959 and 1960, Waring organized performances at the Living Theatre - in whose building he held his composition class - in which his students presented their works; these were a precursor to the Judson Church performances,Banes, Sally (1980) Terpsichore in Sneakers: Post-Modern Dance Boston: Houghton Mifflin. p.8 although Waring, who was 10 years older than the Judson dancers, was never a \\"member\\".Satin (2003), pp.51-52 Still, several of his pieces were presented at Judson concerts. Waring was supportive of the Judson Church dance movement, although he was critical of the church as a venue - seeing it more as a place for experimentation rather than a formal performance space - and critical also of some of the work presented there which, according to Yvonne Rainer, he found \\"dry and boring.\\"Satin (2003), p.62 Waring's own aesthetic was more inclined to be romantic, rather than formally objective, as much of the work by the Judson dancers was.Satin (2003), p.54 Experimental composers that Waring worked with included John Herbert McDowell - who himself choreographed a piece in honor of Waring at one of the Judson Dance Theater concerts - Philip Corner, Malcolm Goldstein, Hy Gubernick, Terry Jennings, Richard Maxfield, and Marga Richter.Satin (2003), p.59 He also collaborated with visual artists who created sets or costumes for his pieces - although he often did the costumes himself. In fact he designed and made many costumes for his colleagues as well, including Twyla Tharp, Remy Charlip, and Aileen Passloff. Waring worked at various times with Julian Beck, George Brecht, Red Grooms, Al Hansen, Robert Indiana, Jasper Johns, Larry Poons, Robert Watts, Robert Whitman, and Julian Wulp. Some of these artists were involved in the creation of \\"Happenings\\", which were free-form inter-disciplinary multi-media events, each one unique, and Waring encouraged this new form; he aided Allen Kaprow in putting on one of his first ones.Satin (2003), p.60 Waring also organized events such as the Pocket Follies benefit in 1963 at the Pocket Theater, which featured many dancers associated with Waring as well as George Brecht, Jill Johnston, and Robert Rauschenberg,Staff (June 6, 1963) \\"'Pocket Follies' Monday Aids Performance Arts\\" Village Voice, in Comenas, Gary \\"Andy Warhol Timeline: June 10, 1963: Freddy Herko, Jill Johnston, Ray Johnson and Robert Rauschenberg Participate in the Pocket Follies\\" Warhol Stars and two months of weekly \\"Events and Entertainments\\" at the same venue in 1964.Satin (2003), pp.58-59 Waring was a writer as well. He wrote poetry, plays, essays and dance criticism, and was one of the founders in 1961 of the New York Poets Theatre, also known as the American Theater for Poets; his plays were also presented there and at the Judson Poets Theater. Waring also directed plays by other writers at the Living Theatre and at the Judson. As a theatre director, Al Carmines thought he was > ...[E]xquisite ... [R]oom was found for the small gesture he loved so > much.Dancer Valda Setterfield spoke of Waring's quarter-inch (0.635 cm) > pli√©s. Satin (2003), p.68 The poetry of [the] words found its perfect > counterpart in Jimmy's direction and clarification. The characters posed on > a sea of words, and they were serene or compassionate as the text calls > for.Satin (2003), p.60, quoting Carmines, Al (April 1978) \\"James Waring at > Judson: A Chronology\\" Judson Arts Program Archive Committee Waring worked with Frank O'Hara, Maria Irene Fornes, Diane Di Prima, Robert Duncan, Paul Goodman, Alan Marlowe and Kenneth Koch, among other poets and writers.Satin (2003), p.57 During this period, he and other dancers worked on the literary newsletter The Floating Bear,Satin (2003), p.58 edited by di Prima and LeRoi Jones,Comenas, Gary \\"Andy Warhol Timeline: May 1963: The 'Billy Linich Show' Takes Place as Part of the Yam Festival?\\"\\" Warhol Stars and Waring's \\"laughter poem for ray johnson\\" (1960) was published in LaMonte Young's An Anthology.Young, LaMonte (1963) An Anthology. Heiner Friedrich. Waring makes a brief appearance in Andy Warhol's 1963 film Haircut No. 1, shot in a huge warehouse with a single spotlight, for which of film were exposed, six rolls, each showing the haircutting from a different angle.Comenas, Gary \\"Haircut (1963)\\" Warhol Stars Death Waring died from a malignant tumor in Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan on December 2, 1975, at the age of 53. At the time he was on the faculty of the University of Maryland, Baltimore. Fittingly, his memorial service was held at the Judson Memorial Church.McDonagh, Don (December 4, 1975) \\"James Waring, Choreographer Of Modern Dance, Dead at 53\\" The New York Times Style and process Waring did not want his dancers to act or emote, as this was conventionally understood. Although he favored \\"florid and dramatic gestures\\" in his pieces, the emotional or dramatic value was to come from clear and precise performance of the choreography, which included gestures, vocalizations and facial expressions. The performer was not to expand these aspects of the dance from their own internal interpretations and analysis. On the other hand, according to David Vaughan, Valda Setterfield and others, Waring trusted his performers to put across the movement as clearly as possible and with conviction, thus making the material real to the audience.Satin (2003), p.71 In Terpsichore in Sneakers, Sally Banes describes Waring's work: > [Waring's] dances sometimes looked like [Merce] Cunningham's - with their > decentralized use of space, collage formats, disconnected structures but > balletic carriage - but his method was based on intuition rather than > chance. Waring abandoned narrative and dramatic structure in the mid-1950s, > creating atmospheres (often nostalgic) referring lovingly and archly to > variety dancing and ballet, and mixing musical as well as dancing styles > (including ordinary and idiosyncratic gestures). Waring was a gentle > humorist, sometimes parodying other dance genres, often close to camp. Choreographer David Gordon, who first danced professionally in Waring's company, describes Waring's process: > Jimmy [Waring] was an education for me, as he was for most people who came > in contact with him. ... [He] taught me about art and developed my taste ... > Jimmy's approach was ... whimsical. His way of working led you - or led me > at any rate - to accept any idea as valid simply because I'd thought of it. > I thought of it and I kept it, and what came next was what I thought of > next. I don't believe Jimmy meant to absolve me of all responsibility for my > work, but I got the impression that wild intuitive guessing was all I had to > do to make art. I never threw anything away. I remember distinctly Jimmy's > saying, \\"If you don't like it now, you can get to like it. If you can't get > to like it, who says you have to like it?\\" The point of it was to demystify > art and free the artist from the limitations of his own taste. There was a > great sense of liberation that stemmed from John Cage's championing of this > philosophy, and Jimmy, among others, was establishing alternatives to the > kind of teaching that had dominated modern-dance composition up until > then.Croce, Arlene (November 29, 1982) \\"Profiles: Making Work\\", The New > Yorker In her Work 1961-73, Yvonne Rainer wrote about Waring: > Jimmy had an amazing gift which - because I was put off by the mixture of > camp and balleticism in his work - I didn't appreciate until much later. His > company was always full of misfits - they were too short or too fat or too > uncoordinated or too mannered or too inexperienced by any other standards. > He had this gift of choosing people who 'couldn't do too much' in > conventional terms but who - under his subtle directorial manipulations - > revealed spectacular stage personalities. He could pull the silk purse out > of the sow's ear. At its worst, dancing with Jimmy could feel like a sow > imitating a swan, but I got a lot out of it.

In his words: \\"Do we make dancing > spectacular ourselves, in the way that we watch? Does our pleasure depend on > our generosity? Is pleasure a meeting of generosities?

The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Sound Recording (Leslie I. Carey). Plot The last thing Collier \\"Collie\\" Lang wants to do is get married, but Marita \\"Killer\\" Connell has other ideas. Collier, a confirmed bachelor, still lives with his mother, a high-powered attorney. When he is unexpectedly called up by the U.S. Army reserve with the rank of captain, Collier is given a peculiar assignment. Superior officer Colonel Head, cooperating with law enforcement, tells Collier about a jewel heist and how one of the gems has been spotted in a perfume ad, worn by Marita, a young actress. There is suspicion that a jewel thief who loves Marita gave her this stolen item, not telling her where or how he got it. Collier's odd assignment is to romance the young lady. Pretending to be a survey taker, he makes her acquaintance at a Beverly Hills hotel where Marita is immediately smitten. So much so that she insists on meeting his mother, crashing Mrs. Laing's party of distinguished guests in an altogether unsuitable outfit and offending them with the scent of her terrible perfume. Marita manages to coax Collier into driving her to Las Vegas to get married. He tries to stall, then finally blurts out that he has no intention of marrying Marita when the jealous jewel thief bursts in on them. Collier must fight off him, then Marita's chauffeur, then even a passing truck driver. A heartbroken and angry Marita wants nothing more to do with him, which is about the same time Collier realizes that he really has fallen in love with her.

Life Gandy, son of James Gandy, was probably born in Ireland. For some years he was an itinerant painter in Devon and the west of England. He went to Plymouth in 1714, and eventually settled in Exeter. According to Northcote, whose grandfather and father knew and befriended Gandy: > He was a man of a most untractable disposition, very resentful, of unbounded > pride, and in the latter part of his life both idle and luxurious; of which > I remember to have heard many instances from my father who knew him, and > whose portrait he painted when a child. > He was at all times totally careless of his reputation as a painter; and > more particularly so if any thing happened in the course of his business to > displease him. He liked people to think that he was a natural son of his father's patron, the Duke of Ormonde, and that he was so much concerned in the duke's affairs that he was not able to make a public appearance in London. Gandy's portrait of the second Duke of Ormonde His portraits, though sometimes slight and sketchy, showed real genius, and were frequently admired by great artists. The portrait of the Rev. Tobias Langdon in the college hall at Exeter excited the admiration of Sir Godfrey Kneller. Gandy may also be credited with having directed and stimulated the rising genius of Sir Joshua Reynolds. Reynolds saw Gandy's pictures early in life, and they made a great impression on his mind; he, like Northcote, often borrowed one of Gandy's portraits, probably the Langdon portrait, to study. He painted Northcote's grandmother, the Rev. Nathaniel Harding of Plymouth, the Rev. John Gilbert, vicar of St. Andrew's, Plymouth (engraved by Vertue as a frontispiece to Gilbert's Sermons), John Patch, surgeon in the Exeter Hospital, the Rev. William Musgrave (engraved by Michael van der Gucht), Sir Edward Seaward in the chapel of the poorhouse at Exeter, Sir William Elwill, and others. Gandy frequently left his pictures to be finished by others. He died in Exeter, and was buried in St. Paul's Church on 14 July 1729.

Its main task was creating the constitution of Latvia - Satversme, which is still in effect to this day. The speaker of Assembly was JƒÅnis ƒåakste, who later became the first President of Latvia. The assembly functioned from May 1, 1920 until November 7, 1922 when the 1st Saeima convened. Electing the Constitutional Assembly On August 19, 1919 Tautas padome issued the law about elections of Constitutional Assembly. Elections were open to male and female citizens who were older than 21, no minimal vote percentage was set, so many small parties were elected. After the end of Latvian War of Independence in January 1920 Constitutional Assembly elections were quickly organized and held on April 17‚Äì18, 1920 when the people of Latvia voted in universal, equal, direct and proportional elections. 25 parties competed for 150 seats. 84.9% of eligible voters participated (677, 084 people). There were 57 candidate lists covering 5 regional constituencies and 16 parties won seats in the Assembly.Satversmes sapulce One hundred fifty members, including 5 women, were elected. The most successful parties were the Social Democratic LSDSP (57 seats), LZS (26 seats) and Latgales Zemnieku partija (17 seats). The remainder of the seats went mostly to ethnic minorities - Committee of the German Baltic Parties, Democrats Union, Polish Party of Latvia and the Worker's Party, Jewish parties and others. The first meeting of the Assembly took place on May 1, 1920, at Riga, in the House of the Livonian Noble Corporation which houses Latvian Parliament up to this day. The Constitutional Assembly drafted the basic law of the state ‚Äî the Satversme ‚Äî as well as other laws. It adopted a law on agrarian reform, a law on the election of the Saeima (Parliament), laws about State flag, State coat of arms, national anthem and other laws.

Hosted by Alan Hughes it aired on TV3 in Ireland on Saturday nights at 9pm. Format Two family teams, each with five members, would be asked to guess the results of surveys, in which 100 people would be asked open ended questions (e.g. \\"we asked 100 people to name something associated with the country Iceland\\" or \\"we asked 100 people to name a breed of dog\\"). Each round begins with a member of each team (in rotation, meaning all players did this at least once) approaching the podium. As the question was read, the first of the two nominees to hit a buzzer gives an answer. If this is not the top answer, the other nominee is asked. The team with the higher answer then chooses whether to \\"play\\" the question, or \\"pass\\" control to the other team (in reality, the teams rarely chose to pass). The host then passed down the line of the controlling team, asking for an answer from each. After each answer, the board revealed whether this answer featured. If a family managed to come up with all the answers on the board (most commonly six in the early part of the show, reduced in number after the commercial break), they won the euro equivalent of the total number of people who had given the answers. Every time someone gave an answer that was not on the board or ran out of time, the family was charged a strike; accumulating three strikes means the family loses control of the board, and the other family has the chance to steal, with only the head of the family giving one answer. If the answer is one of the remaining answers, they won the round and the money; otherwise, the opponents won the money that was on the board. After the first half, answers were worth ‚Ç¨2 times the score. The family who scored the most euros played Big Money. The losing team's winnings would be doubled. Big Money awarded ‚Ç¨1,000 (‚Ç¨2,500 on celebrity specials) for scoring 200 points. Naming all 5 top answers and scoring 200 points doubled said jackpot.

Life Garbrand was born at Oxford. His father, Garbrand Herks or Herks Garbrand, was a Dutch Protestant who had fled from religious persecution in his native country, and settled as a bookseller at Bulkeley Hall, in St. Mary's parish, Oxford. John, the third son, entered Winchester College in 1556, was admitted probationary fellow of New College, Oxford, 24 March 1560, and perpetual fellow in 1562, proceeding B.A. 22 April 1563, and M.A. 25 Feb. 1566‚Äì7.

In 1567 he left Oxford to become rector of North Crawley, Buckinghamshire. In 1568 he was incorporated M.A. at Cambridge, and on 5 July 1582 proceeded B.D. and D.D. at Oxford. Until 1578 he was a prebendary of Wells Cathedral, and for some time he was rector of Farthingstone, Northamptonshire, to the poor of which parish he gave ¬£5. He died at North Crawley on 17 November 1589, and was buried in the church. An inscription describes him as \\"a benefactor to the poor\\".

Young years Garden, a younger son of Alexander Garden, minister of Forgue in Aberdeenshire, and Isobell Middleton, was born at Forgue, and educated at King's College, Aberdeen, where in 1673, at the age of twenty-four, he was already a regent or professor. In 1677 he was ordained by Bishop Scougal, and appointed to succeed his father in the church of Forgue, the bishop's son, Henry Scougal, preaching at his induction. Two years later Garden was promoted to Old Machar (the church of which was the cathedral of Aberdeen). In June 1678 he preached in the chapel of King's College the ‚Äòfuneral sermon‚Äô on his friend, Henry Scougal. It is printed in many editions of Scougall's works, and throws light on the ideas of ministerial duty entertained among the clergy of the ‚Äòsecond episcopacy‚Äô (1662‚Äì1690). \\"Laid aside\\" In 1683 Garden, already a D.D., became one of the ministers of the Kirk of St Nicholas, the town parish of Aberdeen, where he continued till he was ‚Äòlaid aside‚Äô by the privy council in 1692 for ‚Äònot praying for their majesties,‚Äô William III and Mary II. The commission of the general assembly of 1700 had him before them in connection with An Apology for M. Antonia Bourignon (1699, 8vo), attributed to him. Garden, who issued translations of several of Antoinette Bourignon's works with prefaces of his own, refused to disavow the authorship, asserted that ‚Äòthe said \\"Apology\\" as to the bulk of the book did represent the great end of Christianity, which is to bring us back to the love of God and charity, and further declared that the essentials of Christianity are set down in the said book, and that the accessories contained therein are not contrary thereto;‚Äô whereupon the commission suspended him from the office of the ministry, and cited him to the assembly of 1701. He did not appear, and the assembly deposed him and ‚Äòprohibited him from exercising the ministry or any part thereof in all time coming.‚Äô Garden paid no regard to the sentence, and continued to officiate as before to the members of his former congregation who adhered to episcopacy. Against William III but for Queen Anne In 1703 he dedicated to Queen Anne, in terms of fervent loyalty to her, but with outspoken censure of the new presbyterian establishment, his magnificent edition of the works of Dr John Forbes (1593‚Äì1648) (Joannis Forbesii a Corse Opera Omnia), which was published at Amsterdam. Though he had refused to take the oaths to William and Mary, Garden had never approved the arbitrary policy of James II; he accepted the conditions of the Toleration Act; and when after the Peace of Utrecht the episcopal clergy of Aberdeen drew up an address of congratulation to the queen, he and his brother James were chosen to present it. Introduced by the Earl of Mar, then secretary of state for Scotland, they were received with marked graciousness, and poured into her majesty's not unwilling ear (along with their thanks for the freedom they now enjoyed, ‚Äònot only in their exercise of the pastoral care over a willing people, but also in their use of the liturgy of the church of England‚Äô‚Äîthen a new thing among the Scottish episcopalians) their complaints of the persecution they had lately suffered, and their entreaties for a further measure of relief. 1715 uprising The queen's death made Garden and his brother Jacobites again; the insurrection of 1715 restored George for a brief period to the pulpit of St Nicholas, and the brothers were among those who presented to the Pretender at Earl Marischal's house at Fetteresso, Kincardineshire, the address of the episcopal clergy of Aberdeen. On the suppression of the rising, Garden was thrown into prison; he managed shortly afterwards to escape to the continent, but returned to Aberdeen before 1720, when he was talked of for election as their bishop by the Aberdeen clergy. The support he had given to Bourignianism was held by the Scottish bishops, and by Lockhart, the agent of the exiled prince, sufficient to disqualify him for such promotion. After his death He died on 31 January 1733 (Scott's Fasti has wrongly 1723). It illustrates the spread of high church doctrine since the revolution among the Scottish episcopalians that he is called in his epitaph \\"sacerdos\\" (the Latin term for priest). He had fairly earned the praise awarded him of being \\"literis et pietate insignis\\".‚Äô Besides his great edition of Forbes he was the author of the Queries and Protestation of the Scots Episcopal Clergy given in to the Committee of the General Assembly at Aberdeen June 1694, 4to, London, 1694; The Case of the Episcopal Clergy, pts. i. and ii. 4to, Edinburgh, 1703; and he is probably the George Garden of Aberdeen who contributed to the Philosophical Transactions of 1677 and 1693. His Bourignianism, says George Grub doubtfully, was probably due to sheer weariness of the controversies wherewith his country had been so long distracted; moreover, his friend Henry Scougall had been in the habit of going to France as well as to Flanders for spiritual improvement. They may be called the Scottish Quietists. Garden's sermon preached at Scougall's funeral was printed first in 1726. Brother James His elder brother, James (1647‚Äì1726), minister successively of Carnbee (1678‚Äì81), New Machar in Aberdeenshire, Maryculter in Kincardineshire, and of Balmerino in Fife, became professor of divinity at King's College, Aberdeen, and was deprived in 1696 for refusing to sign the Westminster Confession of Faith. 'He seems to have shared his brother's love of mystical theology, without falling into errors of doctrine' (Grub); he shared also his brother's fortunes, and lies beside him in the churchyard of Old Machar.

The Hetmans' Party was aligned with the Russian Empire and supported preservation of the status quo and the \\"Golden Freedoms\\". Its various names come from the fact that it was headed by two hetmans (commanders of Commonwealth military forces), represented the interests of conservative nobles and magnates, and was aligned with the Russian Empire. History =Background= By the early 17th century, the magnates of Poland and Lithuania controlled the state‚Äîor rather, they managed to ensure that no reforms would be carried out that might weaken their privileged status (the \\"Golden Freedoms\\"). The peculiar parliamentary institution of the liberum veto (\\"free veto\\") since 1652 had in principle permitted any Sejm deputy to nullify all the legislation that had been adopted by that Sejm. Thanks to this device, deputies bribed by magnates or foreign powers, or simply content to believe they were living in some kind of \\"Golden Age\\", for over a century paralyzed the Commonwealth's government. The government was near collapse, giving rise to the term \\"Polish anarchy\\". A major opportunity for reform seemed to present itself during the \\"Great\\" or \\"Four-Year Sejm\\" of 1788‚Äì92, which opened on October 6, 1788. Events in the world now played into the reformers' hands. Poland's neighbors were too occupied with wars ‚Äî Prussia with France, Russia and Austria with the Ottoman Empire ‚Äî and with their own internal troubles to intervene forcibly in Poland. The Russian Empire had, since the beginning of the century, been increasingly involved in the Commonwealth politics, and the current situation meant it was paying significantly less attention to the Commonwealth politics. The Patriotic Party was established during the Four-Year Sejm (Great Sejm) of 1788-92 by individuals who sought reforms aimed at strengthening the Polish- Lithuanian Commonwealth and assuring its independence from the Russian Empire. The reforms, however, did not enjoy a unanimous support. =The party= The Hetmans' Party was formed to oppose the reformers. The Party's most notable members included prominent magnates such as Hetmans Franciszek Ksawery Branicki and Seweryn Rzewuski, as well as Stanis≈Çaw Szczƒôsny Potocki and Kazimierz Nestor Sapieha. They wished to preserve the status quo, as the inefficient state machinery meant that the magnates had little, if any, responsibility to the state and were the major power wielders on their lands. They hid their desire for power from the public, and sought support among the lesser, poorer nobility, portraying themselves as defenders of the traditional privileges and freedoms of the Polish nobility (the Golden Liberties) and of the Cardinal Laws. The magnates were not always united, and occasionally fought one another and criticized the Russian influence, though this may have been partly a smokescreen designed to increase their support among the public. The Magnates were aligned with the Russian Empire and formed two groups, one aided by Russian Ambassador Otto Magnus von Stackelberg, and the other by Grigory Potemkin. Many of them had received financial assistance from the Russians. The Russians wielded substantial influence in the Commonwealth, often by bribing Sejm (parliament) deputies, ensuring that the Commonwealth was unable to threaten Russian state interests. Russia's Empress Catherine II saw the Patriotic Party's reform attempts as a threat to Russian influence in the Commonwealth, and possibly as a long-term danger to absolute monarchy in Russia itself. =Aftermath= After the Patriotic Party succeeded in passing the Constitution of 3 May, the hetmans and their supporters created the Targowica Confederation in defense of the traditional Golden Liberties and the cardinal laws, and called for the Russian Empire for assistance. After the War in Defense of the Constitution, which was won by the Confederates and their Russian allies, the Hetman Party was briefly victorious, but events escalated beyond their imagining, with the Second Partition of Poland followed by the Ko≈õciuszko Uprising and the final Third Partition of Poland, ending the independent existence of the Commonwealth.

To distinguish it from the nearby Matagorda Island Light it was given a red glass chimney to be used with the oil lantern to give it its red beam. Though originally constructed on the bay, the current resting place for the light is on Port Lavaca, alongside Highway 35.  History  After the lighthouse on Matagorda Island was completed, residents asked the Lighthouse Board to mark reefs and channels in the actual bay. In response, the Board asked Congress in 1854 for funds to build a screw-pile lighthouse on the southern end of Halfmoon Reef on the eastern side of Matagorda Bay. After four years, seven iron pilings arrived at the reef by barge, each long. The pilings were shipped from Baltimore to Galveston on the same vessel that delivered material for the Point Bolivar Lighthouse and the Matagorda Island Lighthouse. The lighthouse was completed by the first of July, and on the same day the sixth order Fresnel lens displayed its fixed white light. However, mariners complained that the light resembled the one at Matagorda too closely, and a red glass chimney was placed over the lantern to give it an easily identified beacon. During the Civil War, Confederates darkened its light to aid the escape of southern blockade runners. Although the war ended in 1865, the light was not relit until February 20 of 1868. On September 17, 1875, a large hurricane struck the area destroying two other screw-pile lights in the area and devastating Indianola. Strangely, Halfmoon Reef Lighthouse suffered very little damage. In 1886 another hurricane caused damage to the lighthouse, but not much more than the previous hurricane. At this point the Lighthouse Board made the decision to deactivate the lighthouse rather than repair it, as the traffic in Matagorda Bay had begun to decline. Instead of completely demolishing the light, the Board removed the lens but left the light on the shoal as a daymark for the remaining mariners. As the new century arrived, the traffic around Port Lavaca increased and in 1902, the light was given a fourth order red lens lantern as a replacement. In 1911, repairs were made to heighten and reinforce the roof. In 1935, the position of assistant keeper was abolished, and an eight-day lantern was installed permitting the keeper to live ashore. For the next several years the lighthouse braved more violent storms. Though in 1942, a large hurricane ripped off the walkway and weakened the pilings. The Coast Guard, the new owners of the lighthouse, decided to sell the light instead of repairing it. Bill Bauer and Henry Smith eventually purchased the lighthouse and planned to use it as a headquarters for their dredging business at Point Comfort. The lighthouse was placed on a barge by a crane and carried up to Point Comfort. In 1978 Bauer gave the lighthouse to the Calhoun County Historic Commission and transported to its current location. The following year the lighthouse was repaired as an Eagle Scout community project. In 1985, the lighthouse was revealed as a Texas Historical Marker.  Location  Recent image of the lighthouse in Port Lavaca The lighthouse is located on the intersection of Broadway Street and SH35 in Port Lavaca. It is near the West end of the causeway over Lavaca Bay. The grounds are open, but to gain entrance one must visit the Bauer Community Center.

The show is licensed to TV3 through BBC Worldwide. The show is based on Bill Wright's concept which first aired on BBC One back in 1972. The show is well known for its challenging questions, intimidating setting and air of seriousness. The Irish version of the show was hosted by Nora Owen who is a former Irish Fine Gael politician. She was a Teachta D√°la (TD) for Dublin North from 1981 to 1987 and from 1989 to 2002. She also served as Minister for Justice from 1994 to 1997. Format The show was in fact broadcast on TV3 as 'Celebrity Mastermind' in June/July 2012. A series of 'Junior Mastermind' followed in November/December 2012. Each contestant usually has two minutes per round. First, each contestant in turn answers questions on a specialised subject (see examples below). The contestant may pass if he doesn't know the answer, rather than guessing. If a question is answered incorrectly, the questioner will give the answer, using valuable time. However, if 'pass' is given, then the answer is read at the end of the round. After the two minutes is up a buzzer is sounded, which is made up of four beeps; if a question is being read (or has just been read), then the contestant is given a short period of time to answer, leading to the show's famous catchphrase, \\"I've started so I'll finish.\\" After this, answers to any passes are given. After contestants have answered the specialised questions, they are given general knowledge questions. For the 2010/11 series this round lasts 2 minutes, 30 seconds, rather than the usual two. As originally aired the contestants would return for the second round in the same order as for their specialised subject. The contestants are now recalled in reverse order of points scored. The winner is the contestant with the most points. If two or more contestants have an equal number of points, then the contestant with the fewer passes is the winner. The possibility of passing leads to tactical play as passing uses less time allowing more questions to be answered; but may count against the contestant at the end in the event of a tie. Should the top two contestants have the same score and same number of passes at the end of the contest then a tie-breaker is employed, in which the two contenders are each asked the same five questions (one contender must leave the auditorium while the other answers). It is not clear what would happen should this fail to produce a clear winner, though it is implied that the process would simply be repeated as many times as necessary. It is, however, very rare for the tie-break to be required. The winner goes through to the next round, where he must choose a different specialised subject. The winner of the final is declared \\"Mastermind\\" for that year and is the only contestant to receive a prize, in the form of a cut-glass engraved bowl.

It is based on 100 colpi di spazzola prima di andare a dormire (\\"One Hundred Strokes of the Brush Before Bed\\"), a semi- autobiographical novel by Melissa Panarello. It stars Mar√≠a Valverde, Fabrizia Sacchi, Primo Reggiani, Nilo Mur, Elio Germano, Letizia Ciampa, Davide Pasti, Alba Rohrwacher, Piergiorgio Bellocchio, Giulio Berruti, Marcello Mazzarella, Claudio Santamaria and Geraldine Chaplin. The film was released in Italy on 18 November 2005, before being released in Spain on 24 February 2006, by Columbia Pictures. It placed at number one at the box office in Italy. Plot Melissa is a shy 15-year-old girl who lives with her mother Daria and her heavy- smoking grandmother Elvira, while her father is overseas working on an oil rig. She has a close relationship with her grandmother, but feels increasingly distant from her mother. On a summer afternoon, Melissa and her best friend Manuela attend a pool party at the home of Daniele, a wealthy, attractive boy from school, on whom Melissa has a crush. Daniele takes Melissa to a secluded spot, where they talk for a while before he has her perform oral sex on him. Despite the less-than-romantic encounter, Melissa's feelings for Daniele only intensify. After failed attempts to get Daniele's attention, Melissa goes to a bar where he is hanging out with his friends. Daniele then takes Melissa to his place and she loses her virginity to him. She tells him she loves him, but he coldly rejects her. Humiliated, Melissa vows to never let anyone hurt her again and to only think of her own pleasure. Melissa's parents decide it is best to send Elvira off to a nursing home due to her heart condition, which further drives a wedge between Melissa and her mother. When Elvira comes home for Christmas, she senses that Melissa is going through a difficult time and tries to alert Daria, who is completely unaware. One day, Melissa receives a phone call from Daniele, who says he has a surprise and asks her to come over to his place. There, Daniele and his friend Arnaldo goad her into a threesome. Though initially reluctant, Melissa decides to take control of the situation and explore her sexuality. At school, Melissa's diary‚Äîin which she details her sexual encounters‚Äîfalls into the hands of a classmate, who mockingly reads it out loud to other students, including Manuela. Melissa blames Manuela for it and the two have a falling-out. Arnaldo calls Melissa asking her to meet him. He takes her to an underground basement, where he blindfolds her and has her perform oral sex on him and four other young men. When Daria comes home, she is worried to find that Melissa is not home. She goes into Melissa's room and finds her diary, shocked at its contents. While unsuccessfully trying to call Melissa, Daria goes to the nursing home to see Elvira, but is soon notified of her death. Meanwhile, Melissa goes to the apartment of an older man she met on a chat room, who takes pleasure in being whipped. However, he soon becomes violent as he starts whipping Melissa, scaring her. She manages to flee and rushes over to the nursing home. When confronted by her mother about her diary, Melissa confirms that the things she wrote in it are true. The two share a tearful embrace, as Daria apologises for being so oblivious. On the last day of school, Melissa and Manuela rekindle their friendship. Arnaldo confronts Daniele about having sex with his girlfriend, before slapping him in the face. A shy, eccentric student named Marco, who has long had a crush on Melissa, finally musters up the courage to approach her. He says he will be transferring to an art school, showing her a notebook with sketches he has made of her. He draws one last sketch of her before they kiss each other on the cheek. After Marco leaves, Daniele shows up and invites Melissa to a party at his place that night; she reluctantly agrees. At the party, Melissa jumps off a cliff into the sea as Manuela, Daniele and other partygoers look on in awe. She then emerges to the surface with a smile on her face. Melissa and her mother bring flowers to Elvira's grave, and the two joyfully hug each other.

The only manuscript, which is among the Cotton MSS. (Otho C. vi.), was badly damaged by fire. He also wrote a genealogical roll of Tudor ancestry. Life Gardiner may be identical to the Thomas Gardiner who was the son of Helen Tudor, illegitimate daughter of Jasper Tudor. She married a London businessman named William Gardiner. Helen's son Thomas is known to have entered Westminster Abbey as a monk.Douglas Richardson, Plantagenet Ancestry: A Study In Colonial And Medieval Families, Genealogical Publishing, 2011, p.370. Gardiner seems to have studied at Oxford and Cambridge universities. Henry VII appointed Gardiner Prior of Blythe in 1507. He later became Prior of Tynemouth. On his return to Westminster he became a priest in the king's chantry. After the dissolution of the monasteries Gardiner has been described as an \\"ex-monk turned propagandist\\", dedicated to promoting Henry VIII. Writings Gardiner was responsible for two known writings, both of which represent traditional medieval styles of history writing which were already old-fashioned. The Flowers of England was a largely uncritical chronology combining legend with history. His genealogical roll for Henry VIII was similar in character, designed to confirm the noble ancestry of the Tudors.James G. Clark, The Religious Orders in Pre-Reformation England, Boydell & Brewer, Rochester, NY, 2002 p.71. This was presented to the king in 1542. The roll gave Henry VIII a pedigree showing his descent from Cadwallader, referred to as \\"the laste kynge of that blode from whome by trew and lynyall descensse\\" the Tudors descended.

He was one of the committee members at the Marylebone Cricket Club responsible for drafting the original rules of lawn tennis and is credited with devising the cloth covering for the tennis ball. Early life John Moyer Heathcote was born on 12 July 1834 in Westminster London. He was the eldest son of John Heathcote of Conington Castle,Demolished in 1953Burke's Landed Gentry, 1952, 17th edition Huntingdonshire, and his wife the Honourable Emily Colbourne (daughter of Nicholas Colborne, 1st Baron Colborne). He was a descendant of Lord Ancaster of Conington Castle. He was educated at Eton College and was admitted at Trinity College, Cambridge, on 8 October 1851. He was awarded an MA in 1856, but also began playing real tennis at Cambridge. Career Heathcote was admitted at Lincoln's Inn on 27 March 1856 and was called to the bar on 17 November 1859. He served on the Northern Circuit. Heathcote played real tennis regularly at a court in James Street Haymarket from 1856 to 1866. His chief professional teacher and opponent was Edmund Tompkins, for some years champion of tennis. Heathcote became amateur champion in about 1859. At that time, there was no formal competition for the amateur championship, but from 1867 the Marylebone Cricket Club annually offered prizes to its members for play in the courts at Lord's Cricket Ground, and the gold prize carried with it the blue riband of amateur tennis. Heathcote won the gold prize for the next 15 years and in about 1869 he was the equal of any player in the world until the professional George Lambert began to surpass him. Heathcote became involved in lawn tennis which used a vulcanised rubber ball, and he proposed covering the rubber ball with cloth. In 1875, he instigated a meeting at Lords to establish rules for lawn tennis. Walter Clopton Wingfield put forward proposals based on his own game for an hour- glass court and a racquets counting method which were adopted but which led to some objections. By 1877 the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club was proposing the first Wimbledon Tournament, and a review of the rules was required. Heathcote with his fellow MCC commissioner Julian Marshall, and Henry Jones of the All England club laid down the rules that are almost unchanged to this day in time for the first Wimbledon tournament on 9 July 1877. Heathcote was particularly in favour of a return to the rectangular court.Heiner Gillmeister Tennis: a cultural history Heathcote became an Honorary Colonel in the 3rd Volunteer Battalion Suffolk Regiment and became Honorary Colonel of the 1st Administrative Battalion of the Cambridge Rifle Volunteers in 1880. He was chairman of the Huntingdonshire Quarter Sessions and was JP and Deputy Lieutenant for Huntingdonshire, and JP for Sussex and the Liberty of Peterborough. Heathcote was amateur real tennis champion every year until 1882 when the Hon. Alfred Lyttelton ended his long run but in 1883 he regained the title. After this Heathcote only won the gold prize once more in 1886 when Lyttleton was unable to play. Heathcote played tennis for many years and in a number of courts after he retired from competition play. Heathcote had many interests in sports and games including shooting and skating, he was an amateur artist of some repute and was a graceful writer on sporting subjects. He wrote for the Badminton Library authoring Volume 14: Tennis, Lawn Tennis, Rackets & Fives (1890) with contributions by A. Lyttelton, W. C.

Publisher: McFarland & Company, 2005. Format: Paperback, 295 pp. Language: English. Born in Lansing, Michigan, Jackie Kelley grew up in a household devoted to athletic activity. Notably, all four of her brothers were athletes and her mother was a star basketball player, while Jackie was a talented swimmer in pursuit of a professional career. On one occasion, her swimming skills led to saving two people from drowning. She also enjoyed all sports, particularly baseball, and had a strong interest in flying and photography. Kelley was a versatile and dependable performer during her seven years in the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League, being able to play infield, outfield, and pitch with a strong level of consistency. ‚Ä≥Scrounge,‚Ä≥ or ‚Ä≥Babe,‚Ä≥ as Kelley was usually called, was spotted by a AAGPBL scout while she was playing in her hometown. She attended the 1947 AAGPBL spring training held in Havana, Cuba, and made the trip along with her fellow neighbor and long-time friend Alice Pollitt. Kelley was relocated to the South Bend Blue Sox, while Pollitt joined the Rockford Peaches.The Women of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League Following her rookie season in 1947, Kelley was part of the expansion Chicago Colleens in 1948. She opened 1949 with the Peoria Redwings, but rejoined Pollitt on the Peaches in a moment of the season when the league shifted players as needed to help teams stay afloat. She played with the Peaches through 1953, her last year in the league. In 1950, Kelley was a member of the Rockford team that won the championship title and was selected to the All-Star team as a backup outfielder. Her most productive season came in 1951, when she posted career-numbers in games played (107), hits (85), extrabases (22), runs batted in (52) and stolen bases (31), while batting a .224 average and a .286 on-base percentage. In 1952 she enjoyed her best year as a pitcher, after going 12‚Äì11 with a 2.89 earned run average in 209 innings of work. After her baseball career was over, Kelley joined the United States Marine Corps and met her husband. Since 1988 she is part of Women in Baseball, a permanent display based at the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New York, which was unveiled to honor the entire All-American Girls Professional Baseball League rather than individual baseball personalities.

It is thought to be secreted to the extracellular media to recruit copper, a critical component of methane monooxygenase, the first enzyme in the series that catalyzes the oxidation of methane into methanol. Methanobactin functions as a chalkophore, similar to iron siderophores, by binding to Cu(II) or Cu(I) then shuttling the copper into the cell. Methanobactin has an extremely high affinity for binding and Cu(I) with a Kd of approximately 1020 M‚àí1 at pH 8. Additionally, methanobactin can reduce Cu(II), which is toxic to cells, to Cu(I), the form used in pMMO. Moreover, different species of methanobactin are hypothesized to be ubiquitous within the biosphere, especially in light of the discovery of molecules produced by other type II methanotrophs that similarly bind and reduce copper (II) to copper (I).  Strains of Methanobactin  = OB3b = Methanobactin OB3b. PDB Methanobactin OB3b is a commonly studied methanobactin. It has a molecular weight of 1154Da when metal free. OB3b is composed of 9 amino acid residues with two oxazolone rings, which take part in binding to copper ions.Hyung J. Kim, et al. \\"Methanobactin, a Copper- Acquisition Compound from Methane-Oxidizing Bacteria.\\" Science 10 September 2004: Vol. 305 no. 5690 pp. 1612-1615 The oxazalone rings are susceptible to cleavage under low pH conditions, which releases any metal ion bound to the rings. Copper is bound and reduced at a tetradentate binding site composed of 2 oxazolone rings and 2 modified enethiol groups. In particular, the origin and function of these oxazolone rings in methanobactin OB3b has been the subject of research, since these domains appear unique. Recently, it has been suggested that mb OB3b is derived from a small, ribsomally-produced peptide precursor with the sequence of L-C-G-S-C-Y-P-C-S-C-M. Functional mbOB3b is composed of (isobutyl group)-(Oxazolone ring A)-G-S-C-Y-(Oxazolone ring B)-S-M. (Note that some specimens of mBOB3b are found without the C-terminal methionine and appear fully functional.) It has been argued that the chromophoric rings of this particular species of methanobactin enable mbOB3b to bind and reduce other metals. For example, mbOB3b can reduce Ag(I) to Ag(0), Au(III) to Au(0), Cr(VI) to Cr(III), and Hg(II) to Hg(I); it is also able to bind Co(II), Zn (II), Mn(II), Pb(II), and U(IV). Because of this, it is possible that methanobactin may have several medical and environmental applications as a metal chelator and reducing agent. The mechanism of metal reduction is currently undetermined. It has been shown that the tetradentate binding configuration of copper(I) in mbOB3b necessitates the ligation of a water molecule to the copper ion as a ligand.John Z. Hoopes et al. \\"Computational study of the electron transfer reaction in copper-bound methanobactin using density functional theory\\" \\"Abstracts of Papers of the American Chemical Society\\" 241. March 27, 2011 This has been used to argue that water is the source of electrons for reducing the bound metal ion. Others have suggested that the disulfide bridge in methanobactin's structure is the source of the electron, though XPS has shown that this bond is still intact in copper-bound methanobactin. The source of this reducing electron remains elusive at the moment. = SB2 = Methanobactin SB2 is produced by Methylocystis bacteria. SB2 is much smaller than OB3b with a molecular weight of 851Da when metal free. SB2 contains one imidazole ring and one oxazalone ring as well as a sulfate group that are thought to partake in binding copper.

Charskaya was her pseudonym; her real last name was Churilova. Biography Charskaya worked as an actress at the Alexandrinsky Theatre from 1898 to 1924. From 1901 to 1916 she published about eighty books, several of which became bestsellers. Her most popular work was the novel Princess Dzhavakha (1903). In the 1940s, when Boris Pasternak was writing his novel Doctor Zhivago, he said that he was \\"writing almost like Charskaya\\", because he wanted to be accessible and dreamed that his prose would be gulped down \\"even by a seamstress, even by a dishwasher.\\" Her novels fall into four general categories: stories that take place in boarding schools for elite girls; historical novels about women; autobiographical novels that follow the heroine from boarding school to a career; and detective and adventure stories. The main theme of most of her works is friendship among girls. The protagonists are usually independent girls and women who look for adventure or some kind of diversion from the everyday routine. Critics have commented that these characteristics account in large part for the wide popularity of Charskaya's works among young girls in early 20th century Russia. Charskaya's reputation began to fade in 1912 after the critic Korney Chukovsky published an article in which he wrote that her books were formulaic, repetitious, and excessive with respect to female emotions. She stopped publishing in 1916, and in 1920 her works were banned. From 1924 until her death in 1938 she lived in poverty, supported mostly by friends. Throughout the Soviet period her work was lowly regarded, although there is plenty of evidence that young girls continued secretly to read her works, at least through the 1930s. In the late 1980s and 1990s Charskaya's works were revived in Russia, as several of her works appeared in new editions.

The book gives a sweeping narrative of the British Embassy of Sir George Macartney to the Qianlong Emperor of China in 1793. Published originally in French, the book was then translated into English, Chinese, Dutch, and Portuguese. Peyrefitte contends that the frustration of the mission and the stand off in relations between Great Britain and China over diplomatic and audience ritual was caused by the ignorant intransigence and cultural conceit of the imperial court. The empire was \\"immobile\\" because these attitudes stifled China's natural creativity and kept it bureaucratic, static, and feeble over the following century and a half. In doing the research for the book, Peyrefitte used his official connections to gain then unprecedented access to archives in Beijing's Palace Museum and organized a team of researchers to explore them. They found documents concerning the mission, some of which had not been opened since the 1790s, and translated a collection of them.Alain Peyrefitte, Jean-Paul Desroches, Un Choc De Cultures. Paris: Fayard, 1998. 2 vols . Reception and debate The book was widely reviewed, and eventually came out in 36 editions between 1989 and 2007 in 7 languages WorldCat The range of opinions in the major reviews reflect differences over how to interpret China's relations with the west over the last two centuries, particularly attitudes toward globalization and empire. Jane Kate Leonard writing in the American Historical Review was critical, concluding that the book was \\"a pretentious and undigested work of limited antiquarian interest.\\"Jane Kate Leonard, \\"REVIEW: The Immobile Empire, by Peyrefitte, Alain,\\" The American Historical Review 98.5 (1993): 1661-1662. https://www.jstor.org/stable/2167196 The review also contends that Peyrefitte's work does not add to earlier scholarship by J.L. Cranmer-Byng and Earl H. Pritchard. The University of Chicago historian James L. Hevia published a revisionist study which specifically argued that Peyrefitte and others of the \\"free trade\\" interpretation overemphasized economic motives and suggested instead that the British and the Manchu empires both were expanding and both were as much concerned with \\"ritual\\" (in the sense of cultural forms) as with profits as such.James L.

Military career Khan, a German Shepherd Dog, was lent to the War Office by the Railton family from Tolworth, Surrey in the summer of 1942. He had simply been their family pet. Considered a \\"star pupil\\" by officers at the War Dog Training School, he went on to be assigned to the sixth battalion of the Cameronians (Scottish Rifles). Lance Corporal James Muldoon became his handler. In November 1944 the battalion was part of the Allied force sent to attack the island of Walcheren in the Netherlands, as part of the Battle of the Scheldt. The island was of strategic importance and needed to be taken in order for the invasion of Germany to take place. Khan and Muldoon were in an assault craft approaching the island by sea when a spotlight came upon them and the boat came under heavy fire. The boat capsized, sending the soldiers into the water. Khan swam to shore and began to look for Muldoon, who could not swim. While still under heavy shelling, Khan swam the back to Muldoon and pulled him from the water onto the shore. He continued to pull his handler past the muddy shoreline and up onto solid ground, before collapsing next to him. Khan was awarded the Dickin Medal (considered to be the Victoria Cross for animals) for bravery on 27 March 1945. His citation read \\"For rescuing L/Cpl.

In 1872, he won a medal at a competition celebrating the establishment of the Mercado Central de Santiago, organized by Benjam√≠n Vicu√±a Mackenna. Encouraged by this, he was able to obtain a grant to study in Europe, going there with his wife in the company of his friend and future brother-in-law, Alberto Orrego Luco. Upon arriving in Paris, he found himself in the middle of an artistic battle between Neoclassicism and Romanticism, but did not take sides. After some thought, he chose Jules-√âlie Delaunay to be his teacher. He lived in France from 1873 to 1884 and was influenced by Eug√®ne Delacroix, many of whose paintings he copied. Later, he received an \\"honorable mention\\" at the Salon, where little recognition was generally given to Latin American artists. But, despite his successes, he decided to return to Chile, as the time appeared ripe to create an artistic milieu comparable to that in Paris. =Activities in Chile= Soon after his arrival, he organized the first exposition devoted exclusively to Chilean painters. Together with the sculptor Jos√© Miguel Blanco, he founded the \\"Uni√≥n Art√≠stica\\", an organization devoted to promoting more exhibitions and, ultimately, creating the Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes de Chile, which was originally located on the second floor of the National Congress Building. He also created a Salon, similar to the one in Paris, and helped establish a museum in the Quinta Normal, where expositions were held until 1910. In 1892, he was appointed Director of the \\"Escuela de Bellas Artes\\", a position he held until his death. While there, he was a mentor for promising new artists. Among the best known painters whose careers he supported are Pablo Burchard, Pedro Reszka Moreau and Celia Castro, the first Chilean woman to become a notable artist.

The fragments that survive imply that the subject of the poem was not simply the wedding of a certain Ceyx, but Heracles' arrival at, and involvement in, the festivities. For this reason Merkelbach and West suppose that the poem should be regarded \\"as a member of that group of epics and epyllia that dealt with exploits of Heracles, like the Aspis and the Capture of Oechalia.\\". The identity of the Ceyx whose marriage was the titular scene of the poem has been a matter of dispute. Merkelbach and West initially identified him with the ill-fated groom of the similarly ill-fated Alcyone: they were turned into birds for the hubris they showed in referring to one another as \\"Zeus\\" and \\"Hera\\".. Given the poem's apparent focus upon Heracles, however, it is more likely that this Ceyx was actually the king of Trachis who was a nephew of Amphitryon, the great hero's stepfather.. The poem appears to have been popular for the witticisms and riddles uttered at the banquet. One famous riddle is preserved, although incompletely so, by a papyrus scrap and ancient quotations: According to West, the \\"children\\" here are the flames whose mother would be wood.

Soundtrack artists included Kelly Le Roc, Lamarr, Incognito, David Lynden Hall, Fierce and Shola Ama (title track). Reception The film was met with very mixed reviews. The BBC review called it neither \\"a diamond hiding in the rough, or even a half decent feature\\", referring to the acting as \\"woeful\\", the soundtrack \\"cloyingly overbearing\\", which \\"deadens each scene\\", and the films sexual politics \\"dubious, unironic, and completely uninterrogated.\\" According to the reviewer, the film's lack of understanding of sexual politics is illustrated by Steve's taking a role in Shakespeare's Taming of the Shrew, and the film is a \\"clunking, and offensive, drama.\\" Rich Cline called the film an \\"enjoyable low-budget British relationship comedy [which] has a serious sting in its tale at the end that almost undoes it altogether.\\"Cline, Rich (21 August 2003). \\"Emotional Backgammon (review)\\". Shadows on the Wall. Cline enjoyed the film's \\"style and substance\\", \\"visuals\\" and acting, but found the plot to be similar to Two Can Play That Game. He appreciated the use of London locations, intercut with \\"witty fantasy sequences\\" for character point of view, but found the film to take \\"seriously disturbing turns\\" in which misogyny, \\"rape, murder, and homosexuality\\" are introduced at the climax of the film, and \\"seriously weaken the clever and funny film that went before.\\" Angela Swift wrote that even though she hoped it would succeed, and was prepared to grant considerable latitude for any faults, the film \\"unfortunately, does not measure up to our hopes or expectations.\\" Some of the \\"admirable work\\" includes the nearly all-black cast, portraying \\"unabashed ethnicity\\" and the film's \\"almost clever\\" idea with \\"a few good twists\\". Swift found the backgammon-human-relationship simile to be overused, though visually interesting: \\"overkill drowns out any notion of ingenuity\\", and the film's repeated use of a pun on \\"Taming of the shrew\\" to be \\"without subtlety or insight.\\" Overall, the film is \\"relatively unfunny and unsophisticated\\". The Time Out reviewer wondered \\"Are Steve and Jane to blame for what ensues? Or [...] Shakespeare [...]?\\", and found that, although model/actor Johnson \\"manages to cut an intriguing figure, the film leaves the viewer perplexed. Is Herbert just playing with his audience? If so, it's a dangerous game.\\"ACP (2003). Emotional Backgammon. TimeOut Film Guide. Time Out. According to The Guerrilla Film Maker's Handbook, the film grossed ¬£1056, for 209 tickets sold.

By June 1920, Greene had moved to Beaumont, Texas to become a sportswriter for The Beaumont Enterprise. He spent three years in Beaumont and was appointed as the editor of the sports page. While in Beaumont, his baseball writing, covering the Beaumont Exporters of the Texas League, came to the attention of The Sporting News. He became the Beaumont correspondent for The Sporting News from 1920 to 1922. Sports writer in Detroit Greene moved to Detroit, Michigan in August 1922 as a sportswriter for the Detroit Free Press. He spent a year-and-a-half with the Free Press before moving to The Detroit News. He remained with the News for nearly 40 years. He also became the principal Detroit correspondent for The Sporting News from 1924 to 1960. Greene became known for his coverage of the Detroit Tigers, the Michigan Wolverines football team, the Detroit Lions, and boxing. Respected as an expert in each of those sports, Greene was on the committee that chose the American League's Most Valuable Player, and his writing about the Tigers was \\"looked on by other baseball writers as the last word on the matter.\\" He covered the Lions from their first season in the NFL and through their championship seasons in the 1950s. When the Pro Football Hall of Fame was established in the early 1960s, Greene was one of a member of the board of selectors that chose the initial 17 inductees. He began covering the Michigan Wolverines in 1922, and was posthumously honored in 1971 as a charter inductee into the University of Michigan's Media Hall of Fame. His fellow sportswriters recalled him as \\"a gentlemanly patriarch\\" who \\"brought dignity and graciousness to the press boxes of major league sports and to his profession.\\" Jack Dulmage of the Windsor Star described him as follows: \\"He would observe the game with his hat at a rakish tilt, and clench a cigar in his teeth at an impertinent angle. He would move the cigar to laugh heartily at the quips of the day.\\" Joe Falls, who succeeded Greene as the dean of Detroit baseball writers (and who was inducted into the writer's wing of the Baseball Hall of Fame) wrote in his autobiography that Greene was his mentor: \\"My longtime mentor, Sam Greene, of The Detroit News. When I was 30, Sam was 60, and Sam taught me how to behave myself in my job by simply being nice to people, which Sam did in his every waking hour. He could also outwrite me.\\" Greene also befriended many of the great sports figures of his time, counting among his friends Ty Cobb, Babe Ruth, Jack Dempsey, and Tex Rickard. Greene developed a lung infection and underwent lung surgery in 1962. He returned to work shortly after the operation and continued to write until July 1963. His last column concerned the dedication of a plaque at Tiger Stadium honoring Ty Cobb. He died in September 1963. The Associated Press called him \\"one of America's best known sports chroniclers\\" and reported that he died \\"in his bedroom while preparing to listen to the radio report of the Detroit Tigers' game at Boston.\\" The United Press International wrote: \\"The sports world lost one of its most beloved figures yesterday when Sam Greene died at the age of 68.\\" The Long Beach Press-Telegram called him \\"Gentleman Sam\\" and reported: \\"Anybody who knew Sam Greene was grateful for the privilege. A great legion of sports-writer friends now mourn him.\\" Greene's son Edgar \\"Doc\\" Greene was also a sportswriter for The Detroit News. His son was appointed as the sports editor of The Detroit News in November 1963, two months after Greene's death.

Robotic Refueling Mission (RRM) installed on its Support Structure Carrier. The RRM flew aboard Space Shuttle Atlantis on the STS-135 mission The Robotic Refueling Mission (RRM) is a NASA technology demonstration mission with equipment launches in both 2011 and 2013 to increase the technological maturity of in-space rocket propellant transfer technology by testing a wide variety of potential propellant transfer hardware, of both new and existing satellite designs. The first phase of the mission was successfully completed in 2013. The second phase experiments continued in 2015. History =Development= The Robotic Refueling Mission was developed by the Satellite Servicing Capabilities Office at the Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC). It was planned to demonstrate the technology and tools to refuel satellites in orbit by robotic means. After the proof of concept, the long-term goal of NASA is to transfer the technology to the commercial sector. RRM was designed with four tools, each with electronics and two cameras and lights. Additionally, it had pumps and controllers and electrical systems such as electrical valves and sensors. The RRM payload was transported to the Kennedy Space Center in early March 2011, where the GSFC team performed the final preparations for space flight. Once up on the International Space Station, RRM was planned to be installed into the ELC-4. The Dextre robot was planned to be used in 2012 and 2013 during the refueling demonstration experiments. =Launch= The RRM phase 1 experiment platform was launched to the International Space Station (ISS) on 8 July 2011, transported by Space Shuttle Atlantis on STS-135, the 135th and final flight mission of the American Space Shuttle program. Technology demonstration =Phase 1= NASA successfully completed the phase 1 demonstration mission in January 2013, performing a series of robotic refuelings of satellite hardware that had not been designed for refueling . An extensive series of robotically- actuated propellant transfer experiments on the exposed facility platform of the International Space Station (ISS) were completed by the RRM equipment suite and the Canadarm/Dextre robotic arm combination. The experiment suite included a number of propellant valves, nozzles and seals similar to those used on a wide variety of commercial and U.S. government satellites, plus a series of four prototype tools that could be attached to the distal end of the Dextre robotic arm. Each tool was a prototype of a device that could be used by future satellite servicing missions to refuel spacecraft in orbit. RRM is the first in-space refueling demonstration using a platform of fuel valves and spacecraft plumbing representative of most existing satellites, which were not designed for refueling. =Phase 2= Phase 2 of the RRM mission began in August 2013 with the launch of the phase 2 RRM hardware to the ISS aboard the Japanese H-II Transfer Vehicle 4 (HTV-4) for test operations expected to be carried out in 2014. The Phase 2 hardware complement consists of: *Two additional RRM task boards *The RRM On-orbit Transfer Cage *The Visual Inspection Poseable Invertebrate Robot (VIPIR)‚Äîa \\"borescope inspection tool that provides a set of eyes for internal satellite repair jobs.\\" It was launched on ATV-5 and arrived at the station on August 2014.NASA's Space Station Fix-It Demo for Satellites Gets Hardware for 2.0 Update. In February 2014 the ground-based 'Remote Robotic Oxidizer Transfer Test' (RROxiTT) transferred nitrogen tetroxide (NTO) via a standard satellite-fueling valve at the satellite fuelling facility, Kennedy Space Center (KSC), using a robot controlled remotely from the Goddard Space Flight Centre, away in Greenbelt, Maryland. On March 26, 2015 The RRM On-orbit Transfer Cage was loaded into the Kibo airlock and picked up by the JEM Robotic Arm who handed it off to Dextre for installation on the main module. On April 30, 2015 The RRM On-Orbit Transfer Cage was installed on the main module and the Phase 1 hardware was removed and placed in the cage for disposal on HTV-4. The experiment was then activated that same day. February 2016 the Phase 2 experiment was deactivated and all fuel and cooling lines were turned off in preparation for disposal of the RRM payload and its fuel on SpaceX Dragon CRS-10. On February 23, 2017 The main module of the RRM experiment and the Phase 2 hardware were removed and stored in the trunk of SpaceX CRS-10 for disposal and the STP H5 experiment with Raven was activated beginning Phase 3. = Phase 3 = With the completion of Phase 2 Phase 3 testing is underway with the launch of Raven on CRS-10. The new Phase 3 module was delivered to the station on December 8, 2018 on SpaceX CRS-16 and installed on the ELC 1 on December 19, 2018. Zero boil off storage of cryogens (methane) was demonstrated for 4 months, but following a cryocooler failure the methane was vented in April 2019. Remaining tests are still planned; these include plugging a fuel nozzle into a refuelling port.RRM3 @ NASA See also *Advanced Cryogenic Evolved Stage *Orbital Express *Propellant depot *Space Infrastructure Servicing References External links *ISS Update: Robotic Refueling Mission Payload Overview, NASA video, January 25, 2013. \\"it is, or it might be‚Äîonly history will tell‚Äîthe start of what could be a revolution or a new era of how satellites are built and flown in space\\" Robotic manipulation NASA Fuels infrastructure Rocket propellants Articles containing video clips Satellite servicing missions ","title":"Robotic Refueling Mission"},{"id":"32792754","text":"The Forest Practices Board of British Columbia is an independent watchdogGordon Hamilton, \\"Deal with urban wildfire risks now, forest watchdog warns,\\" Vancouver Sun, Feb. 4, 2010, p.

They are microscopic and are used in gardening as a form of biological pest control. They are used to control ants, fleas, moths, beetles, flies, weevils, and other pests. They are also amenable to in vitro culture, making them also of interest to evolutionary and molecular biologists who investigate parasitic and symbiotic systems. Heterorhabditis bacteriophora was selected by the National Human Genome Research Institute as a sequencing target, the inbred strain H. bacteriophora TTO1 was sequenced using Roche 454 technology, and a high-quality 77 Mb draft genome assembly was produced in 2013. To reproduce the nematodes release Photorhabdus bacteria from their digestive tract thus killing these pests, then using the cadaver to grow and reproduce.

It has the particularity that all the species of the genus live in symbiosis with soil entomopathogenic nematodes from the genus Steinernema. Although no free-living forms of Xenorhabdus have ever been isolated outside of the nematode host, the benefits for the bacteria are still unknown. However, it has been demonstrated that the nematode can't establish within his insect host without the bacteria. The tripartite Xenorhabdus- nematode-insect interaction represents a model system in which both mutualistic and pathogenic processes can be studied in a single bacterial species. In laboratory, some species are virulent directly injected within the insect host, whereas others species need the nematode to penetrate into the insect. Lifecycle # In the non-infestant-stage nematode living in the soil, Xenorhabdus spp. are carried in a specialized region of the intestine, termed the receptacle. # At the third-stage of development, the infective juvenile (IJs) invade the hemocoel of susceptible insect hosts. # The bacteria are released in the insect hemocoel, where they overcome the insect's defense systems and produce numerous virulence factors such as hemolysin and cytotoxin. They participate in suppressing insect immunity and killing the host. # The bacteria proliferate to high levels in the insect cadaver and produce diverse antimicrobial compounds that suppress the growth of antagonistic microorganisms. Xenorhabdus spp. also secrete an array of exoenzymes that stimulate macromolecular degradation, the products of which, together with the bacteria themselves, are thought to provide a nutrient base for nematode growth and reproduction. # When nematode numbers become high and nutrients become limiting in the insect cadaver, nematode progeny re-associate with bacteria and differentiate into colonized, non-feeding IJs that emerge into the soil to forage for new hosts. Xenorhabdus like Photorhabdus bacteria has a striking feature of phase variation. Phase I variants are involved in the symbiotic relationship with entomopathogenic nematodes and are isolated from the nonfeeding infective stage nematodes and the body cavities of insects killed by these nematodes. No role in symbiosis has yet been determined for phase II, which is associated only with entomopathogenic nematodes under laboratory conditions.Kaya, H. K; Gaugler, R. 1993. Entomopathogenic nematodes. Annual Review of Entomology, 38: 181-206. Phylogeny Biological pest control The mutualistic association between Xenorhabdus and Steinernema represent an insectidical complex, active against a large range of insect pests. Indeed, the complex is used in biological pest control, and is very efficient against insects such as Spodoptera exigua (Lepidoptera), Cydia pomonella (Lepidoptera), Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Coleoptera), family Tipulidae (Diptera). These bacteria inhabit the gut of the Asian corn borer, a moth pest of maize in East Asia, and kills it within 48 hours. Xenorhabdus nematofila is the most widely used species in biological control, in association with Steinernema carpocapse and Steinernema feltiae. The pathogenicity of the complex is \\"species-specific\\", which means that the complex can only be active against a specific range of insects. The Steinernema-Xenorhabdus association is currently sold as biocontrol agent by private companies, like Biobest, SUMI AGRO, and Biosafe. Perspectives A study carried out by Furgani G. & Al suggests that the antibiotic compounds produced by Xenorhabdus to preserve the insect cadaver from others bacteria may be used in the aim of controlling mastitis caused by bacteria. Indeed, Xenorhabdus budapestensis, X. szentirmaii and X. nematofila appear to be efficient against pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli.

He was born in Brussels in 1931, son of Raymond Jeener (biologist) and H√©l√®ne Massar. He is married to Fran√ßoise Henin. Early life Jeener grew up in Brussels. Career Jeener was professor in Physics at Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles (ULB) from 1960 until he retired in 1996. At ULB, Jeener researched spin thermodynamics and spin dynamics in solids. He introduced the ‚ÄúJeener-Broekaert sequence‚Äù for creating observable quantities of dipolar order in solids.J. Jeener and P. Broekaert, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance in Solids : Thermodynamic Effects of a Pair of rf Pulses, Phys. Rev. 157, 232-240 (1967). Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy Jeener is best known for introducing two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy (2DNMR). In a lecture at the AMPERE Summer School in Basko Polje, Yugoslavia, September 1971,\\"Lecture notes from Ampere Summer School in Basko Polje, Yugoslavia, September, 1971\\", later reprinted in NMR and More in Honour of Anatole Abragam, Eds. M. Goldman and M. Porneuf, Les editions de physique, Avenue du Hoggar, Zone Industrielle de Courtaboeuf, France (1994). Richard R. Ernst - Autobiography available at Nobelprize.org he proposed a novel technique, later known as Correlation Spectroscopy (COSY), in which the response of the nuclear spins to two radio frequency pulses is treated by a double Fourier transformation with respect to the delay between the pulses, and the delay after the second pulse. This technique gives detailed information about the molecular links between atoms, inaccessible with previous techniques. The first experimental demonstration of this technique was carried out by Richard R. Ernst (Nobel prize 1991).W. P. Aue, E. Bartholdi, and R. R. Ernst, Two-dimensional spectroscopy. Application to nuclear magnetic resonance, J. Chem. Phys. Vol. 64, 1 (1976) Later, Jeener introduced a variant of 2DNMR, today known as Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy (NOESY), that gives detailed information about the spin-lattice relaxation matrix, and about the spatial relation between atoms in complex molecules.J. Jeener, B. H. Meier, P. Bachmann, and R. R. Ernst, Investigation of exchange processes by two‚Äêdimensional NMR spectroscopy, J. Chem. Phys. 71, 4546 (1979) 2DNMR and its multi-dimensional extensions reveal so much more information about the chemical and physical environment of the spins that they have since been used in almost all fields of NMR. Among other applications, they enable detailed reconstruction of the 3-dimensional structure of complex biological macro molecules. Recognition Jeener is recipient of several distinctions, including the Prix Quinquennal of the Fonds National de la Recherche Scientifique (Prix Dr. A.

Alexander Blount Mahood (March 17, 1888 ‚Äì December 25, 1970) was a Bluefield, West Virginia-based architect. Life and career Mahood was born in Lynchburg, Virginia in 1888. He attended public schools, after which he attended the √âcole des Beaux-Arts in Paris and studied in the ateliers of Mssrs. Chifflot and Duquesne. After his return from France in 1911, he took a position as draftsman in the Lynchburg firm of Frye & Chesterman. He soon made his way to Roanoke, where he also worked for Henry H. Huggins and Homer M. Miller. In 1912 Miller elevated Mahood to a partner, in Miller & Mahood.American Architects Directory. New York: R. R. Bowker, 1955. Miller had, in 1911, landed a major commission in nearby Bluefield, the Law & Commerce Building - the largest office building in the growing city.Engineering Review Aug. 1911: 82. New York. Mahood was sent to Bluefield to open a branch office, where he would supervise construction and court new business. Upon its completion in 1913, the Mahood offices were moved into the new Law & Commerce Building. The partnership with Miller was dissolved in 1914, and Mahood remained in Bluefield. He remained in private practice until 1923, when he established a partnership with Frederick C. Van Dusen, which lasted until 1926. He was again alone until 1940, when he added Richard T. Snellings of Charlottesville as an associate. His son, A. B. Mahood, Jr. was also made an associate, in 1949. The firm would remain as such until 1970, when Mahood died. Legacy Mahood was the architect for the West Virginia Hotel (1923) and many of his major residential works are in the South Bluefield area. These included the Country Club and the Country Club Hill section where the Bluefield Club was constructed in 1920.Easley House NRHP Nomination. 1991. Mahood designed mansions for magnates of the southern coalfields, and embellished Bluefield's residential districts with some of the grandest Georgian Revival houses in the state. He designed the Women's Dormitory at the West Virginia University in Morgantown, United States Steel Building in Gary, Skyway Drive-In Theater in Brush Fork, the Deco-Style Mercer County Courthouse (1930-1931) in Princeton and the Guyan Theater in Logan. He also designed a number of coal company offices and stores in the southern West Virginia region.

He painted many of his portraits at sittings in the studio and gardens of Hyme House. Sitters included royalty, celebrities, businesspeople and politicians from the 1920s and 1930s (2)(4). The house was built in 1886; de Laszlo and his wife, heiress Lucy Guinness (3), lived there from 1921 to 1937. In 1938 the Sisters of Mercy of the Holy Cross, a Catholic Religious Order, acquired Hyme House and later took over the villas at numbers 5 and 7. The Order linked the three villas into a girls' school, which operated up until 1985 (3). The house then became the Fitzjohn's Lodge Hotel (3). Construction In 1875 Hampstead landowner Spencer Maryon-Wilson commissioned land agent F.J. Clark and developer John Culverhouse, to design an architectural master plan to provide new housing on part of his Hampstead estate (3). Finalised in 1876, the master plan was centred on a tree-lined boulevard, known as Fitzjohn's Avenue (named after one of the family's country homes), lined with 70 villas and chestnut trees (3). Around this main boulevard were a series of adjoining streets including Netherhall and Maresfield Gardens, named after the Manor House and parish of the Maryon-Wilson's estate in Sussex (3). Located on large building plots, all the houses were detached or semi-detached villas set well back from the roads, with long front paths and generous front and rear gardens. The houses were designed in either Queen Anne revival, Gothic or Arts and Crafts-influenced styles, the last a tribute to Norman Shaw who designed a series of buildings in the local Hampstead area (3). The neighbourhood of Fitzjohn's Avenue was built in the 10 years after 1876. In 1883 Harpers Magazine called Fitzjohn's Avenue \\"one of the noblest streets in the world\\". (3) In 1886 No.3 Fitzjohn's Avenue was built and was known as Hyme House. The house was built in the style of the Arts & Crafts movement, with a brick, tile-hung and terracotta facade with large bay windows, balconies, ornate pediments, decorative brickwork, carved brackets, terracotta gabling, feature chimneys and hand-crafted entrance porticos (3). Owners It was sold to J. Lewis, a wealthy South African diamond merchant, who acquired a second plot of land to the south of the main house on which was built garaging and a hard tennis court (1). The house was then sold to August Ries. who lived in it for many years until it was sold in 1921 to portrait painter Philip de Laszlo (1). de Laszlo was born in Budapest in 1869 and studied at the National Academy of Art, followed by art studies in Munich and Paris (2). He became a portrait painter, and won a Grand Gold Medal at the Paris International Exhibition of 1900 for his portrait of Pope Leo XIII (2). In the same year he married society beauty Lucy Guinness; they had six children (2). In 1907 Philip and Lucy de Laszlo moved to England (2) where he spent the rest of his life. The family initially took a house in Regent's Park at 19 Hanover Terrace (2), moving in 1908 to a house at 3 Palace Gate in Kensington. Neither property was large enough to accommodate an artist's studio, so de Laszlo travelled daily to a studio he rented on Campden Hill (2). In 1907 Philip painted a portrait of King Edward VII. During his British career he painted some 5,000 portraits of royalty, leading political and business figures, and members of the landed gentry (2). In 1909 King Edward VII appointed him a Member of the Royal Victorian Order, and in 1912 Emperor Franz Joseph of Austro-Hungarian Empire ennobled him. He became a British citizen in 1914, and in 1930 he was elected President of the Royal Society of British Artists (2). In January 1921 Philip, Lucy and family moved into Hyme House(1). Its grounds, which contained gardens, garaging with a flat above, and a hard tennis court were large enough to allow an artist's studio to be built in the grounds, linked to the main house by a covered walkway (1). de Laszlo obtained a licence to build the studio from Spencer Maryon-Wilson, the original landowner and master developer of Fitzjohn's Avenue and its surrounding roads. The studio opened onto a stone patio and lawns, lined with mature hedges and trees (1). In the studio and gardens of Hyme House de Laszlo painted many of his best-known portraits (2). At the height of his fame he could command an extraordinary ¬£3,000 for a full-length portrait (2). The interiors of Hyme House and studio had oak flooring with high ceilings, elegant ceiling cornicing and panelled doors (4). The furniture was predominantly Italian, with Flemish tapestries and de Laszlo's paintings on the walls (4). Antiques included a 13th-century Sicilian chest, pieces by Auguste Rodin, and Louis XIV candlesticks and a sculpture of the King on horseback that had once been in the Palais de Versailles (4). In 1925 and 1931 the Duchess of York (later The Queen Mother) sat for portraits in the studio at Hyme House, accompanied by Princess (later Queen) Elizabeth(2). In 1933 Princess Elizabeth had her portrait painted, with part of the sitting done in the Hampstead studio and the background completed at Windsor Castle. This was the first official portrait sitting for a painter by Elizabeth(2). Princess Marina, Duchess of Kent and sister-in-law of the King, had her portrait painted in the studio in 1934. Other royal visitors included Queen Marie of Romania and Prince Chichibu of Japan, the brother of Emperor Hirohito (2). Prince Chichibu and his wife Princess Setsuko attended the Coronation of King George VI in 1937; while in London they visited the studio at Hyme House to have their portraits painted (2). Film footage survives of Philip de Laszlo entertaining Princess Elizabeth and the Duke and Duchess of York at Hyme House in 1933. Other visitors filmed in the studio and lawns of the villa include Prince George, Duke of Kent, and the Maharaja of Jaipur (5). During the 1920s and 1930s many artists, writers, magazine and newspaper editors, merchants and physicians lived in Fitzjohn's; its close proximity to the centre of London enabled people to commute daily (3). No 61 was the home of painter Edwin Long (1829‚Äì91), artist John Pettie (1839‚Äì93) lived at No.62, artist Paul Falconer Poole (1807‚Äì79) lived at No.75 and No.6 was the home of portrait painter Frank Holl (1845‚Äì88) (3). There were so many artists on the avenue that it became a tradition for their houses to be opened on special days ‚Äì known as \\"Show Sundays\\" - for friends, colleagues, and neighbours to see their latest artwork. According to novelist Max Pemberton (1863‚Äì1950) who lived at No.50, the \\"Show Sundays\\" attracted everyone from \\"those who should have been a source of inspiration to the makers of the latest fashions\\" (3). Philip de Laszlo's last royal portrait was of the Duke of Connaught and Strathearn, completed at Fitzjohn's Avenue on the morning of 20 October 1937. On 20 November of that year the Government of Hungary conferred upon him the Badge of the Corvinus Order of Honour, Hungary's highest award for artistic merit (2). de Laszlo died on 22 November 1937 at the age of 68 (2). After World War II an honorary (not officially listed) blue plaque was fitted on the wall of his former home, commemorating his life and time at the villa (3). In March 1938 Cardinal Einsley, Catholic Archbishop of Westminster, acquired Hyme House. Philip's studio was converted into a chapel, and on the site of the garage and tennis court a church, dedicated to St. Thomas More, was later constructed (1). In the same year, the Cardinal invited the Sisters of Mercy of the Holy Cross, a Swiss-based Catholic religious order, to acquire Hyme House to serve as their first foundation in England (1). During the Second World War Hyme House served as a nursing home for injured civilians and military personnel, run by the Sisters of Mercy. Since 1945 After the war, the Sisters of Mercy also took over the two villas at No.s 5 and 7 (3). The Order linked and converted the three villas into a convent and girls' school. In 1985 the villas became the Fitzjohn's Lodge Hotel(3). In 2006 development company Mayfair Developments acquired the property and began a five-year construction project to convert the site back to residential use.

The Nasta Runestone, listed as N√§ 34 in the Rundata catalog, is a Viking Age memorial runestone located in Nasta, which is 3 kilometers northwest of Glanshammar, √ñrebro County, Sweden, which was in the historic province of N√§rke. Description The inscription on N√§ 34 consists of runic text in the younger futhark within a runic text band that arches around the edge of the stone, and a depiction of a beast and an intertwined serpent and a facial mask. The inscription on this granite stone, which is 2.25 meters in height, is classified as perhaps being carved in runestone style Pr3, which is also known as Urnes style. This is the classification for runic bands with beast or serpent heads depicted in profile with almond shaped eyes. The question regarding the proper classification for N√§ 34 is that the runic text band has no attached beast or serpent heads, but the depiction of the serpent and beast depicted have some characteristics typical of the Urnes style. The facial mask on this stone, which is just under the arch of the text band, is a common motif and is found on several other Scandinavian runestones including DR 62 in Sjelle, DR 66 in √Örhus, DR 81 in Skjern, DR 258 in B√∂sarp, the now-lost DR 286 in Hunnestad, DR 314 in Lund, DR 335 in V√§stra Str√∂, Vg 106 in Lasseg√•rden, S√∂ 86 in √Öby √§gor, S√∂ 112 in Kolunda, S√∂ 167 in Landshammar, S√∂ 367 in Sl√§bro, U 508 in Gillberga, U 670 in R√∂lunda, U 678 in Skokloster, U 824 in Holms, U 1034 in Tensta, and U 1150 in Bj√∂rklinge, and on the Sjellebro Stone. The stone was noted as being on a pile of rocks during the initial survey of Swedish runestones in the 1600s by Johannes Bureus. As it was near a main road, the stone was raised in 1672 by Johan Hadorph for the Eriksgata of king Charles XI. It was noted that local people in the 1700s sometimes bit the stone as a cure for toothaches and left pins or nails on the stone as offerings for good crops. In 1952 the stone was moved six meters from the south side to the north side of the road. The runic text states that the stone was raised as a memorial by a woman named √û√≥rhei√∞r for her son named Ly√∞bj√¥rn, who is described in Old Norse as being nytan, which is a rare word that is translated as \\"capable\\" but may mean \\"bright and cheerful.\\" The text is very worn and was somewhat damaged in the 1840s when a farmer attempted to \\"improve\\" the inscription. The stone is known locally as the Nastastenen or, since it is the only runestone in the Rinkaby synod, as the Rinkabystenen.

Origin  The one-million-year-old Homo sample BOU-VP-2/66 from the Dakanihylo Member, referred to as ‚ÄúDaka‚Äù calvaria, was discovered in Bouri, Ethiopia, found in the Middle Awash region of the Afar Rift. This area has, not surprisingly, been the source of many human ancestor fossils, with ages ranging from half a million years old to more than 6 million years old. The resemblance of the Daka Skull to Asian counterparts indicates that the early Eurasian and African fossil hominids represent demes of a widespread palaeospecies. The anatomical intermediacy of Daka between earlier and later African fossils provides evolutionary change evidence. There is a consensus that there is a ‚Äúlack of calvarial evidence for a deep phylo-genetic division between the African and Asian fossils.‚Äù According to researchers, a phenetic approach, quantifying overall similarity of single specimens, found that the Daka calvaria shares affinities with two fossils from the Koobi Fora region of Africa, KNM-ER 3733 and KNM-ER 3883. These are attributed to Homo ergaster, which is very different from Homo erectus.  Cranial Morphology  The Daka Calvaria has a cranial capacity of 995cc (for reference, a chimp has about 375cc and a human about 1,200cc). Through the use of computed tomographic (CT) imagery of the Daka calvaria, observations have been made on the distortion, subcortical structures and endocranial features of this skull fossil. According to the CT-derived metrics for the Daka calvaria, the occipital Asterion thickness was 10.6 mm, with the temporal Asterion thickness measuring at 10.2mm. The Calvarial height above g-l, above g-op and above n-op, were measured at 51mm, 73mm and 80mm, respectively; Endocranial capacity was found to be around 986ml. The strong flexion that is apparent in Daka strengthens the theory that midsagittal cranial base flexion was strong in Homo erectus in general. Due to the age and condition of the Daka skull, the fossil is not fully intact. The right side of the calvaria is slightly more damaged and there is a relatively large space in the posterior region of the mastoid area near the Asterion. Researchers found that the mastoid process of the artifact are both damaged extensively. ‚ÄúNeither side preserves the inferior portions, but pneumatization of the temporal bone superior to the mastoid tips extends superiorly nearly to Asterion on both sides.‚Äù The temporals on the skull are not as inflated as those of apes, with smaller individual cells. The Daka calvaria temporal squamae measure at approximately 5.7mm thick centrally. The posterior temporal is approximately 10.6mm thick adjacent to the occipitomastoid suture.

Lockyer and two colleagues died in a helicopter accident while on assignment filming a story about Lake Eyre, South Australia. Early years and background Lockyer was the younger of two sons of Nona and Norman Lockyer. He was born and grew up on a farm near Corrigin, about east of Perth. He later boarded at Aquinas College in Perth where he played hockey. Career In 1969 at age 19, Lockyer became a cadet journalist with the Perth office of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), before moving to Sydney and then Canberra in the mid-1970s. In 1979 Lockyer became an ABC correspondent in Port Moresby and then Jakarta before a three-year posting in Bangkok. It was during this period that he reported on events following the Vietnam War and the Khmer Rouge killing fields. He was posted to Washington, D.C. where as ABC correspondent during the Reagan administration he covered Central and North America. Lockyer later returned to Asia, taking up a posting in ABC's Singapore office and reporting on the trial and subsequent execution of Kevin Barlow and Brian Chambers on drug trafficking charges. Lockyer was nominated for a Gold Walkley award for his coverage of the trial and execution. In 1988 he joined the Nine Network in Sydney. Lockyer's reporting on a drought in eastern Australia in 1994 for A Current Affair was credited for inspiring the Farmhand Appeal. He worked across a range of programs for the network including Sunday, Midday, and the Wide World of Sports. After returning to the ABC in 1999, Lockyer won a Logie Award for Most Outstanding News Reporter in 2001 for his daily coverage of the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games. He later led ABC TV News coverage of the 2004 Athens Olympics and reported on the 2008 Beijing Olympics for the 7.30 Report. In 2005, Lockyer was the presenter for the ABC television news in Western Australia. However, it was his coverage of rural stories that he was most passionate about. Lockyer's was the first news team to report from Grantham in the Lockyer Valley in the aftermath of the 2010‚Äì2011 Queensland floods; for the first 24 hours he was the only reporter on the ground in Grantham. Lockyer also provided in depth coverage of the impact of Cyclone Yasi. Lockyer was awarded the Centenary Medal in 2003 for his coverage of rural issues, particularly the extensive drought and he was twice awarded the NSW Farmers' Association Mackellar Media prize for coverage of rural issues. Lockyer reported the 2006 rescue of two miners from Tasmania's Beaconsfield gold mine. Lockyer's final story was an interview with Bob Lasseter, who is searching for Lasseter's Reef. Bob Lasseter is the son of Harold Lasseter, the man who claimed to have originally found the gold deposit. The story was broadcast on 7.30, on 29 August 2011. Death On 18 August 2011, Lockyer and two fellow ABC employees, pilot Gary Ticehurst and cameraman John Bean, died in a helicopter crash on the eastern shore of Lake Eyre in South Australia. The trio were on assignment filming a story about the lake. The aircraft was an A√©rospatiale Industries AS355F2 helicopter owned by the ABC. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau conducted an investigation into the fatal accident, finding the probable cause to be spatial disorientation of the pilot, during a period of high workload shortly after taking off for a VFR flight on a dark night. The accident was the first fatal accident involving a twin-engine helicopter in Australia since 1986. Addressing Parliament, the Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, spoke of Lockyer's coverage of important events, his famous inland reports and his reporting of the 2010‚Äì2011 Queensland floods. She spoke of the dangers journalists were exposed to, saying \\"[They] took these risks and told these stories.

He served on the Montreal city council from 1978 to 1986 as a member of mayor Jean Drapeau's Civic Party and was a member of the Montreal executive committee (i.e., the municipal cabinet). In 1991, he was appointed as a judge on the Quebec Superior Court. Private career Beaudoin was a lawyer in private life. A Montreal Gazette report indicates that he was fifty years old in 1986.Ingrid Peritz, \\"Dupras has contenders if Civic Party pulls it off,\\" Montreal Gazette, 1 November 1986, B1. Councillor Beaudoin was first elected to the Montreal city council in the 1978 municipal election and was re-elected in 1982. He served as vice- president of the Montreal executive committee for a time and was chair of council from 1982 to 1986. In May 1986, Beaudoin presided over the first Montreal city council meeting in which journalists were allowed to bring cameras and recording equipment into the chambers.Ingrid Peritz, \\"City council yields, lets cameras, tapes into session,\\" Montreal Gazette, 7 May 1985, A1. When Drapeau announced his retirement in 1986, Beaudoin supported Claude Dupras's successful bid to become the Civic Party's new leader and mayoral candidate.Ingrid Peritz, \\"Dupras has contenders if Civic Party pulls it off,\\" Montreal Gazette, 1 November 1986, B1. Dupras was defeated by Montreal Citizens' Movement candidate Jean Dor√© in the general election, while Beaudoin was defeated in Gabriel-Sagard by MCM candidate Vittorio Capparelli. Beaudoin became the Civic Party's vice-president after the election. He resigned from the party executive in February 1989, saying that the party's attempts at democratization \\"[had] not achieved the desired results.\\"\\"Civic Party without leader as top executives resign,\\" Montreal Gazette, 25 February 1989, A3. Federal politics Beaudoin was a supporter of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada at the federal level.Ingrid Peritz, \\"Dupras has contenders if Civic Party pulls it off,\\" Montreal Gazette, 1 November 1986, B1. He was chosen as president of the party's Rosemont association in August 1988, with support from the party establishment. Rosemont's Member of Parliament (MP) at the time was Suzanne Blais-Grenier, who questioned the legitimacy of Beaudoin's election and suggested that it was part of an effort to pressure her into resigning.Elizabeth Thompson, \\"Blais-Grenier denies feeling any pressure to step down,\\" Montreal Gazette, 17 August 1988, A5. Her supporters set up a rival association with a different president, and a quarrel ensued as to which group controlled the local party finances.Elizabeth Thompson, \\"Potential candidate drops out of running for Rosemont seat,\\" Montreal Gazette, 15 September 1988, A3; Elizabeth Thompson, \\"Tories, Blais-Grenier tangling over funds,\\" Montreal Gazette, 27 September 1988, A5. Blais-Grenier was ultimately kicked out of the Progressive Conservative party, and Beaudoin's association was recognized as official. Shortly thereafter, Beaudoin resigned as president to become the Progressive Conservative candidate for Saint-L√©onard in the 1988 federal election. This contest was expected to be close, but it was not; Beaudoin finished a fairly distant second against Liberal incumbent Alfonso Gagliano.William Marsden, \\"Liberal credits Italian vote in re-election,\\" Montreal Gazette, 22 November 1988, B12. Judge In December 1991, Canadian federal justice minister Kim Campbell appointed Beaudoin as a judge on the Quebec Superior Court.\\"Campbell appoints 18 to provincial courts,\\" Globe and Mail, 24 December 1991, A8. ;Notable rulings Beaudoin ruled in July 1993 that the last remaining English-language school overseen by the Montreal Catholic School Commission in C√¥te-des-Neiges could be redesignated as a French-language school. Several parents of anglophone children argued that the commission made its decision without proper consultation; Beaudoin concluded that the parents did not prove their case.Catherine Buckie, \\"Judge rules that St. Kevin School be turned over to French students,\\" Montreal Gazette, 15 July 1993, A4. In 1997, Beaudoin dismissed a lawsuit from a Quebec resident who had sued McDonald's for $33,864 after suffering second-degree burns from spilled coffee. The litigant was seated in a car that was not moving at the time of the incident, and Beaudoin ruled that only the Quebec automobile-insurance board (rather than the company) could be held liable for \\"damage caused by an automobile.\\" The Quebec Court of Appeal later overturned Beaudoin's decision, concluding that there was no link between the litigant's injuries and the use or ownership of a car.Bernard Perusse, \\"Buyer, store agree on refund,\\" Montreal Gazette, 21 April 2000, D12. Beaudoin reviewed a class-action lawsuit by former Jonqui√®re Wal-Mart employees in 2005, following the company's decision to close their Jonqui√®re branch after a successful unionization drive by the employees. Wal- Mart claimed that the store was not sufficiently profitable, while opponents argued the company's decision was intended to intimidate workers in other branches.Paul Delean, \\"Wal-Mart ruling on hold,\\" Montreal Gazette, 27 September 2005, B3. Beaudoin ultimately ruled that the lawsuit could not proceed, on the grounds that the dispute with Wal-Mart was the exclusive jurisdiction of the Quebec labour board. The former employees announced they would appeal the decision.\\"Unionized workers at a Wal-Mart store in Jonquiere, Que., that closed in April will appeal a Superior Court decision that threw out their class-action lawsuit seeking damages for wrongful dismissal,\\" Canadian Press, 2 December 2005.

It is located near naval base INS Jarawa, on Port Blair in the Andaman & Nicobar Islands. It shares airside facilities with Veer Savarkar International Airport which handles civilian traffic.  History  The airfield at Port Blair was transferred from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation to the Indian Navy on 9 March 1984. It was initially commissioned as INS Jarawa II. On 11 May 1985, the air station was formally commissioned as INS Utkrosh by then Defence Minister of India, P. V. Narasimha Rao, making it the first naval air station in Andaman & Nicobar Islands. Its location makes it an important strategic station for protecting India's maritime interests in the Bay of Bengal. It also serves as an important facility for undertaking humanitarian operations, such as disaster relief and evacuation of medical emergencies from the remote islands. The facilities at INS Utkrosh have been significantly upgraded. The runway has been lengthened to almost . Except for the civilian terminal operated by the Airports Authority of India, all other air traffic operations over Port Blair are undertaken by INS Utkrosh. The geography makes this a difficult airfield for aircraft, as a hillock at one end means that planes can land or take off only in one direction. Winds change here every six months, so pilots have to either take off or land with strong tail winds.

First (boulevard du Temple, 1785‚Äì1799)  The first D√©lassements-Comiques was a small theatre on the boulevard du Temple, originally located between the H√¥tel Foulon (the site of the later Th√©√¢tre Historique) and the site of the later Cirque Olympique. It was opened in 1785 by the author, director and actor Plancher ('Aristide Valcour' 1751-1815).Brazier 1838, p. 65. Burnt down on 2 February 1787, it was rebuilt and reopened in 1788 and continued until 1799.Lecomte 1905, p. 23. The theatre was popular and this excited the jealousy of other neighbouring theatres, resulting in a regulation against productions other than pantomimes and the employment of more than three actors at the same time, unless obscured by a gauze curtain. On 14 July 1789, the day of the storming of the Bastille, Plancher Valcour tore down the gauze curtain in his theatre with the cry of \\"Vive la libert√©!\\" In 1792 the theatre was taken over by Colon.Brazier 1838, p. 65. In 1801, the building took the name of the Th√©√¢tre Lyri-Comique, only to close in the following year. It then became the third Th√©√¢tre des Vari√©t√©s- Amusantes in 1803, followed by the Nouveaux Troubadours in 1805.See Lecomte 1905. The latter was forced to close in 1807 as a result of Napoleon's decree on the theatres. Most of the building was demolished except for the entry hall, which continued to be used for exhibiting trained dogs and monkeys performing tricks.Hemmings 1994, p. 122.  Second (boulevard du Temple, 1804‚Äì1806)  A second theatre with the name D√©lassements-Comiques, also on the boulevard du Temple, operated from 1804 to 1806.  Third (boulevard du Temple, 1841‚Äì1864)  Theatres on the boulevard du Temple, ca. 1862. The Th√©√¢tre des D√©lassements-Comiques is second from the right.

Her new theatre was known as the Spectacle des Acrobates de Madame Saqui, but it closed in 1832 and was replaced with Dorsay's Th√©√¢tre du Temple. After renovation in 1841, a third theatre re-using the old name D√©lassements-Comiques opened at this location.McCormick 1993, p. 37; Lecomte 1905, pp. 23, 38. The popular cancan dancer Marguerite Badel ('Rigolboche') appeared there from 1858 to 1860. With Haussmann's renovation of Paris the building on the boulevard du Temple was slated for demolition, and the company relocated to the 26 rue de Provence on 30 May 1862, finally closing in January 1864.  Fourth (boulevard du Prince Eug√®ne, 1866‚Äì1871)  On 15 February 1866 a fourth theatre using the name D√©lassements-Comiques opened at 23 boulevard du Prince Eug√®ne (today the boulevard Voltaire). Within a few months its name changed to Th√©√¢tre du Prince Eug√®ne, but the name D√©lassements-Comiques was restored in 1867. The theatre presented Herv√©'s Les contes de f√©es on 5 March 1871.G√§nzl 2001, p. 916. The theatre was destroyed by fire during the last days of the Paris Commune in 1871.  Fifth (rue du Faubourg-Saint-Martin, 1873‚Äì1878)  The troupe re- opened in 1873 in the building of the second Th√©√¢tre des Nouveaut√©s (on the rue du Faubourg-Saint-Martin) and continued to operate until 1878. Robert Planquette's 1-act operetta Paille d'avoine was presented on 12 March 1874,G√§nzl 2001, p. 1624. as well as Herv√©'s La noce √† Briochet on 26 April 1874.  Sixth (1886‚Äì1890)  A sixth D√©lassements-Comiques ran from 1886 to 1890.Lecomte 1905, p. 24.

Production cost an estimated Rp 240 million, making it the most expensive Indonesian movie up to that point. It tells the story of a village struggling against the Dutch colonial military during the Java War, and touches on the themes of nationalism and cultural identity. The movie won 6 Citra Awards. Production November 1828 was directed by Teguh Karya, who drew heavily on his theatre troupe Teater Popular Workshop for cast members. November 1828 uses contrasting shooting styles for each side of the struggle. When depicting the Dutch colonial army, it uses Western-influenced techniques, including Dutch group paintings and the conventions of Western drama. However, when the Javanese revolutionaries are depicted, the filming draws on Javanese traditions or uses techniques \\"especially developed for the film\\". Production cost an estimated Rp 240 million, most of which was spent on producing historically accurate settings and props. At the time, it was the most expensive Indonesian film ever made and twice the cost of a regular production. Plot November 1828 was based on the Java war, led by Diponegoro. During the Java War, when Prince Diponegoro led a general uprising against the Dutch colonial government, the Dutch military occupy a small town in Central Java owing to concerns that they have been collaborating with Sentot Prawirodjo, one of the leaders of the Javanese forces. The village chief, Jayengnegoro, accuses elder Kromoludiro of aiding Diponegoro's forces; Kromoludiro is arrested and tortured by Dutch leader Captain de Borst. In response, village kyai Karto Sarjan sends one of his students to find Sentot. During Kromoludiro's torture, de Borst's second-in-command Lieutenant van Aaken admits that it was he who had informed Diponegoro's forces of the Dutch movements. Enraged, de Borst kills Kromoludiro and arrests van Aaken. Not long afterwards, Sentot's forces enter under the guise of dancers and attack the village from within, confusing the Dutch forces; Sentot himself arrives not long afterwards, defeating the Dutch forces before they can respond effectively. De Borst is slowly killed, while van Aaken dies in the crossfire. Themes and symbolism November 1828 has been seen as a \\"challenging account of cultural differences.\\" Wanning Sun notes that, seeing as Teguh Karya himself was of mixed foreign (Chinese) and local descent, November 1828 draws numerous parallels with his life, emphasizing the backgrounds of the mixed- race de Borst and van Aaken. He writes that November 1828 is an \\"indictment of a system that refused full citizenship to those of Chinese descent and simultaneously denied them a place to explore their Chineseness\\". Sun also draws on similarities between the liberation of the village and the Indonesian revolution, with representation by the Indonesian military and Islamic figures; both groups played a key role in the revolution. Release and reception November 1828 was released in 1979 and advertised as Karya's most patriotic work. It soon became known as a classic. It was also the first Indonesian film to become well known outside of Indonesia, drawing some critical attention. It won 6 Citra Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director. Deanne Schultz considers November 1828 \\"a valuable interpretation\\" of Indonesian colonial history, providing enough background for people with little knowledge of Indonesian history to understand the storyline. She writes that it \\"embodies the best of popular Indonesian cinema.\\" Ade Irwansyah of Tabloid Bintang listed November 1828 as the 7th best Indonesian film of all time.

History  The rabbit immune system has been documented as a vehicle for developing antibodies with higher affinity and more diverse recognition of many molecules including phospho-peptides, carbohydrates and immunogens that are not otherwise immunogenic in mouse. However, until recently, the type of antibodies available from rabbit had been limited in scope to polyclonal antibodies. Several efforts were made to generate rabbit monoclonal antibodies after the development of mouse hybridoma technology in the 1970s. Research was conducted into mouse-rabbit hetero-hybridomas to make rabbit monoclonal antibodies. However, these hetero-hybridomas were ultimately difficult to clone, and the clones, generally unstable, and did not secrete antibody over a prolonged period of time.  Initial fusion partner  In 1995, Katherine Knight and her colleagues, at Loyola University of Chicago, succeeded in developing a double transgenic rabbit over-expressing the oncogenes v-abl and c-myc under the control of the immunoglobulin heavy and light chain enhancers. The rabbit formed a myeloma-like tumor, allowing the isolation of a plasmacytoma cell line, named 240E-1. Fusion of 240E-1 cells with rabbit lymphocytes produced hybridomas that secreted rabbit monoclonal antibodies in a consistent manner. However, like the early mouse myeloma lines developed in the 1970s, stability was a concern. A number of laboratories which had received the 240E-1 cell line from Dr. Knight‚Äôs laboratory reported stability problems with the fusion cell line 240E-1.  Improved fusion partner  In 1996, Weimin Zhu and Robert Pytela, at the University of California San Francisco (UCSF), obtained 240E-1 from Dr. Knight‚Äôs laboratory and attempted to develop an improved rabbit hybridoma. Improvements in the characteristics of 240E-1 were accomplished by repeated subcloning, selection for high fusion efficiency, robust growth, and morphological characteristics such as a bright appearance under a phase-contrast microscope. Selected subclones were further tested for their ability to produce a stable hybridoma and monoclonal antibody secretion. After multiple rounds of subcloning and selection processes, a new cell line named 240E-W, was identified and which expressed better fusion efficiency and stability. Cell line 240E-W has since been further developed and optimized for production of rabbit monoclonal antibodies for research and commercial applications.  Process  The process of hybridoma formation in a rabbit first entails obtaining B-cells from a rabbit that has been immunized. There are numerous immunization protocols for rabbit, notably for the generation of polyclonal antibodies. After immunization, B-cells are fused with a candidate rabbit fusion partner cell line to form hybridomas. Resulting antibodies from hybridomas are screened for an antigen which meets criteria of interest by diagnostic tests such as ELISA, Western blot, Immunohistochemistry and FACS. The resulting hybrdomas may be subcloned to ensure monoclonal characteristics.  Humanization of rabbit antibodies  Mitchell Ho and colleagues at the National Cancer Institute isolated a group of rabbit monoclonal antibodies (e.g. YP218, YP223) that recognize rare epitopes of mesothelin, including poorly immunogenic sites, for cancer therapy. 50px Material was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. Mitchell Ho and Yifan Zhang analyzed the complex structures of rabbit antibodies with their antigens from the Protein Data Bank, and identified antigen-contacting residues on the rabbit Fv within the 6 Angstrom distance to its antigen. They named \\"HV4\\" and \\"LV4\\" in rabbit Fvs, non-complementarity-determining region (CDR) loops that are structurally close to the antigen and located in framework 3 of the rabbit heavy chain and light chain, respectively. Based on the structural analysis, they designed a humanization strategy by grafting the combined Kabat/IMGT/Paratome CDRs into a human germline framework sequence. The immunotoxins composed of the humanized rabbit Fvs (including hYP218) fused to a clinically used toxin showed stronger cytotoxicity against tumor cells than the immunotoxins derived from their original rabbit Fvs. The CAR T cells (meso3) based on the hYP218 antibody targeting a membrane-proximal epitope of mesothelin shows effective inhibition of large tumors in mice. The method (i.e. grafting combined Kabat/IMGT/Paratome rabbit CDRs to a stable human germline framework) has been suggested as a general approach to humanize rabbit antibodies.

It was recorded as the sixth single and eleventh track from their second studio album American Tragedy (2011). The song was produced by Griffin Boice. This song is the one of the few songs by Hollywood Undead to feature a member other than Danny or Deuce as the clean vocalist. Charlie Scene performs the chorus of \\"Bullet,\\" in addition to \\"Rain\\" from Notes from the Underground. The song has received positive reviews from critics due to its cheerful tone and uptempo beat that directly contrast its dark lyrics about suicide and self-harm.  Background and development  \\"Bullet\\" was written by Lewis Edwards. The song contains verses by Terrell and Ragan, and a b-section and chorus sung by Terrell. The song was produced, recorded, and mixed by Griffin Boice at the Beat Suite in Hollywood, California.(2011) Release notes for American Tragedy by Hollywood Undead (liner notes). A&M;/Octone Records (B0014411-02)  Composition and lyrics  The acoustic guitar pattern repeats throughout the intro and outro, the verse, the pre-chorus and the chorus in a pattern of intro-verse-pre chorus-chorus-verse-pre chorus-outro, with the chord progression being E-B-C#m-A. The chord progression during the pre-chorus is G#m-F#m-E-D#m-C-B, with every chord following a two strum pattern, with the exceptions of C and B, which both follow an eight strum pattern. The lyrics detail a teenage male's trouble with attempted (or successful) suicide. The chorus, which the song opens with, implies past attempts at suicide for the protagonist: \\"My legs are dangling off the edge, the bottom of the bottle is my only friend. I think I'll slit my wrist again, and I'm gone, gone, gone, gone! My legs are dangling off the edge, a stomach full of pills didn't work again. I put a bullet in my head, and I'm gone, gone, gone, gone!\\" The protagonist continues in the verses to describe the decomposition of his life, stating that his \\"two best friends\\" are \\"a bottle of pills\\" and \\"a bottle of Gin\\". We then learn he is at the top of a twenty story building, and that the polishing of a bottle is \\"pushing [me]\\" off and he describes how asphalt has never \\"looked so soft\\". The protagonist begins to express concern that his mother found his suicide note and had called the police. He starts realising he needs to move fast, as he hears \\"sirens and they're off in the distance\\" and that he's \\"more scarred than my wrist is\\". He states that he's going to purchase a suit, because \\"when you go to meet God ya know you wanna look nice.\\" The pre-chorus states that \\"So if I survive then I'll see you tomorrow\\" and the chorus plays again. Johnny 3 Tears takes the second verse from a third-person point of view of another young man who had an abusive family life. The young man's father had apparently abandoned him, which left his mother guilt-struck, and he had gone astray in a way that is not specified. It is, however, stated that he \\"Climbed to the roof to see if [you] could fly\\". This ends the verse, and goes into the pre-chorus and chorus. After the chorus, Petra Christensen sings the outro stated by J-Dog in a Hollywood Undead live cast in January promoting the release for the band's latest album.  Remix contest  The band has hosted a remix contest for the songs \\"Bullet\\" and \\"Le Deux\\". Bullet's remix is hosted on Indaba Music and is chosen by voting majority. One of the top five voted remixes will be picked by the band themselves, and will receive the grand prize of a Cakewalk SONAR X1 Producer, a Cakewalk Z3TA+2 virtual instrument, and a Roland audio interface. The remix will also be featured on an upcoming official remix EP. Five honorable mentions from the top ten remixes will be sent a Hollywood Undead album signed by the members. Submissions for the contest were due by August 24, 2011.  Critical reception  The song has received positive reviews from music critics. Rick Florino of Artist Direct had a list of ten reasons readers needed American Tragedy, with number three being the track \\"Bullet\\". Florino explains that \\"Hollywood Undead snap from faint acoustic guitar into cinematic rhyming about suicide. It's as infectious as it is intense.\\" He states that the ending refrain featuring a little girl \\"is utterly powerful.\\" He also stated that \\"Bullet\\" is \\"the kind of song that could save some kid in the crowd,\\" and closed his review stating that the song is \\"heart-wrenching genius.\\" In his official review, Florino again referenced \\"Bullet\\" stating it was one of \\"two moments that make [American Tragedy] a classic,\\" stating that \\"After an acoustic intro, the song tells a potent and poignant tale of longing for suicide. However, it's the sunniest and catchiest tune on American Tragedy\\" and that the band's genius lies \\"in that dangerous space between unforgettable and unsettling.\\" He compared Johnny 3 Tears' verse to being as soulful as Jonathan Davis of Korn. The album as a whole garnered five out of five stars. Jeremy Borjon of Revolver described the song as \\"a disturbingly upbeat song about a man attempting suicide\\" and included it with several other songs as high points of the album. He gave the album four out of five stars. Richard Solomon of The Minaret stated that the song was in a part of the album that \\"stayed strong and continued to please\\", and analyzed it as \\"an intense song about suicide,\\" and stated that \\"[t]he lyrics are probably more depressing than most.

Eastward beyond that, the Trans-Samaria Highway was only Route 505.

It is located in Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh on the east coast of India.  History  The Indian Navy initially started aviation operations in Visakhapatnam in the late 1970s, with the construction of four helipads adjacent to the civil airfield. The civilian Visakhapatnam Airport was transferred to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation in 1981. The air station was then called Naval Air Station, Visakhapatnam. Additional hangars, maintenance facilities and an operations complex were constructed soon after. On 21 October 1991, the air station was renamed and formally commissioned as INS Dega by then Vice Admiral Laxminarayan Ramdas. It is named for the Telugu language word for a big and powerful bird of the eagle family.

In order to decrease the growing flight traffic in the base, a new base has been under consideration by the navy at Badangi, near Vizayanagaram The plan for the expansion of the airbase envisages a massive increase in size as well as capabilities. In the final scenario, from the present size of 1100 acres, the INS Dega will be spread out to over 1500 acres.

It is the only species of its genus. Description A very small fish which shows a reduction in size and some neoteny when compared to its larger relatives. Habitat and ecology The West African pygmy herring is found in rivers and man-made lakes. It schools in open waters and to a maximum depth of around ; rising to about from the surface at night in Lake Volta. It feeds on plankton, especially cladocerans. Distribution The West African pygmy herring has a widespread but patchy distribution from Senegal to Cameroon. In west Africa it occurs in Senegal River, Gambia River, Bia River, Niger River basin and Wouri River, as well as the man made Lake Volta and Lake Kainji. This species is native to Cameroon, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Nigeria, Gambia, Senegal and Sierra Leone. Fisheries and conservation As the West African pygmy herring has a widespread distribution and it is short lived with high resilience to exploitation, it is therefore listed as Least Concern. In Nigeria this species is subject to some commercial fishing for human consumption. Taxonomy The West African pygmy herring was first described from Sierra Leone buth this was somewhat controversial and claims were made that the specimens were nothing more than the unmetamorphosed larva of a species of Pellonula or of Cyanothrissa. However, when fully mature specimens of Sierrathrissa were described at 21-28mm SL it was clear that these were not juveniles of other species.

The episode originally aired on NBC in the United States on September 22, 2011. It was written and directed by executive producer B. J. Novak. The series‚Äîpresented as if it were a real documentary‚Äîdepicts the everyday lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania, branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In the episode, new CEO Robert California (James Spader) writes a mysterious list that has a line down the middle and every member of the office on either one side or the other. The office members frantically try to figure out what it means, causing a crisis for new manager Andy Bernard. \\"The List\\" was the first episode of The Office to feature James Spader's Robert California in a starring role. The episode received moderately positive reviews with many commenting that it proved the series could survive without Carell. According to Nielsen Media Research, \\"The List\\" drew an estimated 7.63 million viewers and received a 3.9 rating/10% share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic, making it, at the time, the lowest-rated season premiere since the first-season premiere. Synopsis Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) explains to the camera that Robert California (James Spader) was appointed Regional Manager of the Scranton Branch, but on his first day traveled to Florida and convinced Jo Bennett to give him her position as CEO of Dunder Mifflin-Sabre. Robert then appointed Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) as Scranton Regional Manager in his place. Andy makes it his goal for the office to receive a half day off on the Friday before the Columbus Day weekend. Robert accidentally leaves his personal notebook at Erin Hannon's (Ellie Kemper) desk, and she notices it contains a list of Scranton's employees on two columns with a line down the middle. Concerned about what the list means, the employees pressure Andy to ask Robert about it. Robert is offended by Andy's inquiry, assuming that he snooped through his notebook. While brushing the list off as \\"doodles,\\" he conspicuously moves Andy's name from the left column to the right. Later that day, Robert invites the employees on the left column to lunch: Jim, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson), Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson), Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey), Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner), Phyllis Vance (Phyllis Smith), Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) and Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez). After they leave, the \\"right-siders\\" try to console themselves with a pizza party, but remain despondent about their exclusion. During lunch (which Toby decides to eventually leave), the \\"left-siders\\" pester Robert about the list. Slightly intoxicated, Robert informs them that the left-siders are \\"winners\\" while the right side are \\"losers\\". Jim is astonished, but the others become cocky. Kevin sends a mass text to the right-siders, mocking them as \\"losers\\", and later squirts Meredith Palmer (Kate Flannery) with a water pistol. Andy does not like this and confronts Robert with a demand to alter the list. Robert refuses, and then speaks to everyone by admitting to calling certain members of the office losers, but also reprimanding them for fixating so much on someone else's opinion of them, saying he will be working with them a long time and that his opinions on certain people may very well change, finishing with \\"Winners, prove me right; losers, prove me wrong\\". Andy, unsatisfied, lists off the qualities the right-siders have, stating that Stanley Hudson (Leslie David Baker) may be a grump, but has the best sales record in the office (something Robert admits to being unaware of); Meredith is persistent and does not know what the word \\"no\\" means; and Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) is \\"easily the most creative and kind person [he has] ever worked with\\". Andy concedes to Robert that putting Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods) in the losers' column was \\"astute\\". He then demands the Columbus half day and exits, prompting a respecting smile from Robert. Though the office annually gets the half day in any case, they happily wish him good evening as they depart, and Andy looks very pleased with his work as the boss. Pam is pregnant with her and Jim's second child (revealed to be a boy) and is emotional, easily brought to tears throughout the day. Angela is also pregnant, having married the state senator Robert Lipton over the summer, and says that she's \\"Little Preg\\" to Pam's \\"Big Preg\\". When Jim picks up his things to leave for the day, he \\"accidentally\\" drops a piece of paper. Pam picks it up and sees Jim's personal winners and losers list: Pam, Cece and their new baby are on the left, and the words \\"everything else\\" is written on the right. Pam tearfully vows to frame it. Production \\"The List\\" marked James Spader's first appearance as a regular on The Office. The episode was written and directed by executive producer B. J. Novak, who also portrays Ryan Howard in the series. It is Novak's fourteenth writing credit and third directing credit for the series. \\"The List\\", which commenced filming on July 25, 2011, served to redefine and reorient The Office, as the series's former lead actor Steve Carell had left the show following the previous season's twenty-second episode, \\"Goodbye, Michael\\". The plot of this episode is furthermore a continuation of and a resolution to the plot of the seventh season finale \\"Search Committee\\", wherein several potential candidates (most of whom were played by guest actors) appeared, but no definitive decision as to who would become the new manager was offered. On June 27, 2011, co-creator and executive producer Ricky Gervais announced that James Spader was to join the cast on a permanent basis. Spader subsequently appeared in this episode, having previously made a cameo in the aforementioned seventh season finale. He would go on to appear in 15 of the eighth's seasons episodes, and throughout the season he served as a replacement for Jo Bennett, the former CEO of Sabre (who was portrayed by Kathy Bates, who had left the series due to her commitment for the NBC drama series, Harry's Law). In addition to Spader joining the cast, \\"The List\\" also revealed that Andy (portrayed by Ed Helms) would ascend to the position of manager; the series' executive Producer and showrunner Paul Lieberstein revealed this information to Ed Helms during lunch in June. Prior to their decision, the writers had gone through the main contenders for the job, Darryl, Dwight and Andy, and concluded that Andy would be the best choice. Finally, this episode opens with the announcement that Pam is pregnant with her second child. Pam's pregnancy was written into the show so as to correspond with Jenna Fischer's real-life pregnancy. The Season Eight DVD contains a number of deleted scenes from this episode. Notable cut scenes include Ryan explaining where trends comes from and Gabe explaining why he's back in a talking head, Andy attempting to calm everybody down while they try to figure out what the list means, and more scenes with the winner's lunch and the loser's pizza party. Cultural references The cold open features multiple workers \\"planking\\", an activity consisting of lying face down in an unusual or incongruous location. This was the third season premiere to include an internet trend in the cold open in a row. The first was in \\"Gossip\\" where Michael, Dwight and Andy try to film a video of them attempting parkour. The second was in \\"Nepotism\\" where the office make a lip dub video of the song \\"Nobody but Me\\". Throughout the episode, Pam is seen crying at a commercial for The Travelers Companies featuring a dog trying to keep his dog bone safe. Reception =Ratings= In its original American broadcast on September 22, 2011, \\"The List\\" was viewed by an estimated 7.63 million viewers and received a 3.9 rating/10% share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49. This means that it was seen by 3.9% of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 10% of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. This marked an 11 percent fall in the demographic from the seventh-season premiere, \\"Nepotism\\", making it the lowest-rated season premiere. It was also the last episode of The Office to be viewed by more than 7 million viewers. The episode ranked second in its timeslot beating Person of Interest which received a 3.1 rating/8% share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic and The Secret Circle which received a 0.9 rating/2% share, but was defeated by The X Factor which received a 4.4 rating/11% share and tied with Grey's Anatomy which received a 3.9 rating/10% share. \\"The List\\" was the twenty-second most-watched show for the week of broadcast among adults aged 18‚Äì49. =Reviews= \\"The List\\" received moderately positive reviews. Myles McNutt of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a \\"B\\" and wrote that the entry \\"was about on par with what the show was delivering last season.\\" He was slightly critical of the episode's tone, noting that it \\"eschew[ed] subtlety\\" and, instead, yielded, \\"a thesis statement for the transitional season to come\\". HitFix reviewer Alan Sepinwall complimented the final scene featuring Andy confronting Robert calling it \\"sweet and felt genuine, in the way that made the show's early days feel special.\\" Despite this, he said the \\"story fell a little flat.\\" Linda Holmes of NPR praised the choice of adding James Spader, making Andy the manager, and praised the writers for differentiating Andy as manager from Michael. IGN writer Cindy White praised the episode for being an \\"ensemble affair\\" writing that \\"And when you've got an ensemble this strong, that's a smart way to go\\". She concluded that \\"In context with the rest of NBC's hilarious Thursday-night lineup ... The Office can't help but seem a little long in the tooth. But you can always rely on it for at least a few laugh-out-loud moments ... I'm not ready to call time of death on this show just yet. She ultimately gave the episode an 8.0/10. TV Guide writers Joyce Eng and Kate Stanhope called the promotion of Andy as manager the third best television moment of the week. James Poniewozik of Time gave the episode a positive review commenting that \\"it at least showed that a season 8 Office is capable of delivering the funny as well as the character grace notes\\".

She makes paintings and ceramic sculpture that weave elements using architectural, design, cultural and historical references. Life DiMattio grew up in the Chelsea neighborhood of New York City. Her mother was a college counselor and ceramist and her father was a vision scientist in the Physiology Dept. at NYU Medical Center. She attended NYC Public schools including the Lab School and LaGuardia High School of Music and Art graduating in 1999. She received her BFA from the Cooper Union in 2003 and her MFA from Columbia University of the Arts in 2005. She lives and works in New York City and Hillsdale, NY. Career Francesca DiMattio (born 1981) is an American artist born and based in New York City. She makes paintings that weave spaces using architectural, cultural and historical references. Patterns, textures and imagery combine to forge a logical cohesion from apparently disparate and chaotic elements. Large mural works on canvas have been displayed in the Saatchi Gallery in London, Locust Projects in Miami, Salon 94 Bowery in NYC and the ICA in Boston. In recent solo shows (2014-8) in New York City and London she has introduced ceramic sculpture that aspires to the monumental via a feminine strength and whimsy. DiMattio fractures and reconfigures a wide array of references including art history, children‚Äôs books, cartoons, pop culture, and craft. Though elements seem ready-made, she, in fact, sculpts and glazes everything by hand. Her sculptures are complex and multifaceted‚Äîeach angle revealing seemingly endless experimentations in ceramic and glazing techniques. Throughout each assemblage, DiMattio‚Äôs layering and fragmentation maps a crucial dialogue between cultures and styles, pointing to the plasticity of representation. Through shifts in scale, elements that are typically accents become primary. Things do not behave as expected. Tiny figurines appear over scaled, floral motifs become viral, and torsos morph from flora and fauna. Through painting and the hybridization of art and craft she has introduced a dialogue with the past that has enlivened the contemporary world art scene. Her ceramic sculptures include monumental candelabras heavy with historical references suggesting the weight of ceramic styles on chaotic post-modern lighting and living. Her totems reference Greek Caryatids carried into a present rethinking of the weight women bear today.A large monstrous 9-foot tall piece, She-Wolf (2018), evokes Yeats‚Äô, The Second Coming with its ending ‚Ä¶‚Äù And what rough beast, its hour come round at last, Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?‚Äù The Caryatid works ‚Äúexemplify this penchant for hybridity, each one encapsulating several oppositions between masculine and feminine, playful and serious, contemporary and ancient, high culture and low‚Äù(Fullerton). DiMattio takes traditional aspects of femininity and adds different components to the design of the sculpture.‚ÄúDespite the show‚Äôs title, one was immediately struck by the fact that these figures had been liberated from their traditional role as architectural supports‚Äù(Fullerton). The layering in her work is not only visual but also figurative, for example the freeing of the caryatid can be looked at as freeing the female body of traditional view. DiMattio also creates paintings that ‚Äútake architecture as their subject as a means to restructure the concept of space‚Äù(Saatchi). In her paintings Ladder and Broken Arch at the Saatchi Gallery,‚Äúelements collide into each other, become entangled, and co- exist‚Äîcomplicating our understanding of perspective and space. Her work seems to exist somewhere in between the abstract and the figurative‚Äù(Saatchi). In Boston, DiMattio has transformed the Sandra and Gerald Fineberg Art Wall with a complex composition made up of five large-scale canvases. Drawing inspiration from the ICA‚Äôs dramatic architecture and waterfront setting, Banquet combines interior and exterior space and incorporates images of ships and the sea. and the ICA in Boston.

The first check issued to Bringas and Stewart by Columbia Records was to The Opposites, on 9/24/62; check #22231. The group eventually expanded into four primary voices, adding Columbia producer Terry Melcher and co-producer Bruce Johnston (best known as a member of the Beach Boys). This group came to be associated with the hot-rod and surf genres of that day, although their first single (\\"Here I Stand\\") did not reflect those styles. They recorded for Columbia Records in Hollywood from 1962 to 1965. The group placed five singles on the Billboard Hot 100. They are best known for their number-four single: \\"Hey Little Cobra\\".  Group history  = Early days = Stewart and Bringas became acquainted during the mid-1950s as students at Inglewood High School (about ten miles south of Hollywood). They discovered some complementary musical talents and struck up a friendship. Encouraged by their singing compatibility, they were determined to secure a recording contract. They eventually came to the attention of Arwin Records/Daywin Music in 1962.Friends Magazine, Editor, Bruce Hilton, EUB Board of Publication, 1965, p. 6. Also see: Hey Little Cobra and other Hot Rod Hits, Sony Music Special Products, ¬© 1996, Sundazed Music, Inc., p. 3. Actress- singer Doris Day and her husband, film producer Marty Melcher, owned Arwin Records and Daywin Music. Their son, Terry Melcher, had just been hired by Columbia Records as an A&R; (artist and repertoire) producer. Arwin Records vice-president Bob Crystal saw potential in Stewart and Bringas' voices, and quickly arranged for an audition at Columbia Records.Hollywood Reporter, December 6, 1962 Following the audition, Terry Melcher signed Stewart and Bringas to a recording contract at Columbia. Their moniker, the Opposites, seemed apropos at the time because Bringas was studying for the ministry and Stewart was a private detective. But shortly before their first release, the name was changed to the Rip Chords.Hey Little Cobra and other Hot Rod Hits, Sony Music Special Products, ¬© 1996, Sundazed Music, Inc., p. 3. The change was prompted by concerns that the Opposites could falsely imply a positive versus negative image of the two friends. According to Melcher, \\"Actually, I gave them the name and it was just a play on words. It had nothing to do with the TV show Ripcord (spelled without the h).\\" The Rip Chords were a vocal group. They were not a band (no musical instruments, although Stewart played limited guitar).Inglewood Daily News, March 22, 1963. Accordingly, Stewart and Bringas needed to be backed instrumentally by studio musicians. These musicians, including guitarist Glen Campbell, drummer Hal Blaine, and bassist Ray Pohlman, and other prominent instrumentalists, were known as the Wrecking Crew. = First single = Terry Melcher produced the Rip Chords' first release, \\"Here I Stand\\", a remake of the Wade Flemons version. Recorded on December 17, 1962,Hey Little Cobra and other Hot Rod Hits, Sony Music Special Products, ¬© 1996, Sundazed Music, Inc., p. 3. Also: Summer U.S.A.!

Stewart and Bringas were the only singers on the first release. Bringas sang the lead, the falsetto, and also joined Stewart on the background vocals.Cash Box, 4/6/63; 4/27/63; 5/25/63. Stewart and Bringas agreed that \\"Glen Campbell...gave the song a great lift with his lead guitar. Recent remix attempts have watered down his contribution, but on the original release, the imprint of his lead guitar is indelible.\\"Jesusgate: A History Of Concealment Unraveled, October 2012, Rainbow Ridge Publishing, page 1, = Second single = The group's second single, again produced by Melcher, was \\"Gone\\", recorded April 26, 1963.Hey Little Cobra and other Hot Rod Hits, Sony Music Special Products, ¬© 1996 Sundazed Music, Inc., pp. 3 & 7. Bringas sang the lead and the falsetto, with Stewart and Bringas doing layered background vocals and The Blossoms providing additional background vocals during the intro and outro. Bruce Johnston (a friend of Melcher) added an interjecting falsetto, and Blossoms member Gracia Nitzche performed the spoken word intro. Although the song penetrated the Billboard Hot 100, it did not fare as well as the previous hit, \\"Here I Stand\\",The Best of the Rip Chords, Sony Music Special Products, ¬© 2006, Sundazed Music, Inc., p 2. but did well in certain markets such as San Antonio, Texas, where it climbed to number two on KTSA's top 55 survey. = Bringas hiatus = Following the release of \\"Gone\\", a problem arose for the Rip Chords. Bringas had just graduated from California State University at Long Beach and was planning to do graduate work at United Theological Seminary in Dayton, Ohio, where he eventually earned his Master of Divinity degree. His educational responsibilities would not allow time for the touring aspect of a recording group.Ray Black, Dayton Daily News 2/19/65 = Johnston and Melcher vocals = Because of his ministerial studies, Bringas was unable to get back to Hollywood for the next recording session. This left Stewart momentarily without a singing partner. Melcher and co-producer Johnston stepped in vocally to fill the void created by Bringas' brief absence; Johnston had already sung with Stewart and Bringas on their second single \\"Gone\\". Johnston and Melcher would prove to be a significant addition as the Rip Chords prepared to record and release their third single.The Best of the Rip Chords, Sony Music Special Products, ¬© & (p) 2006, Sundazed Music, Inc., pp. 1 & 2. = \\"Hey Little Cobra\\" = The Rip Chords' third single was the hit \\"Hey Little Cobra\\", vocally layered by Johnston and Melcher, recorded on October 15, 1963. Melcher sang the lead vocal. He and Johnston did the background vocals.Hey Little Cobra and other Hot Rod Hits, Sony Music Special Products, ¬© 1996, Sundazed Music, Inc., p. 4. The song peaked at No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 in February 1964.Billboard, February 8, 1964 Initially, when the \\"Cobra\\" single was released, Johnston and Melcher did not receive any credit for their vocal participation because, at that point in time, they were \\"ghost\\" singers, similar to a ghostwriter. Terry Melcher and Bruce Johnston were both credited as the two producers of Hey Little Cobra but they would remain ghost singers for the remainder of the Rip Chords' existence. = Return of Bringas = Ernie Bringas (left), co-founder of the Rip Chords, with Bruce Johnston after a July 7, 2012 Beach Boys 50th-anniversary concert in Phoenix, Arizona Following the \\"Hey Little Cobra\\" single, Bringas, having missed the previous recording session, was able to rejoin the group. However, based on the success of the ‚Ä≥Cobra‚Ä≥ single, the original Rip Chords (Stewart and Bringas) would now expand into four primary voices, adding Melcher and Johnston, who continued on as ghost singers.Summer U.S.A.! The Best of the Rip Chords, Sony Music Special Products, ¬© & (p) 2006, Sundazed Music Inc., p. 3. Stephen J. McParland, Editor of California Music Magazine. = Recording and touring groups = Although Bringas was back in the studio to record, he remained unavailable for touring because of his educational commitment. Therefore, as a practicality, two young men (Rich Rotkin and Arnie Marcus) were brought on board to tour with Stewart as the Rip Chords until the group disbanded in 1965. Thus, Stewart, Rotkin, and Marcus became the official touring wing of the Rip Chords. However, Rotkin and Marcus were never vocally involved in any Rip Chords' recordings. Columbia Records never made a distinction between the recording Rip Chords and the touring Rip Chords. On the contrary, it was only the touring Rip Chords that were promoted in all of the publicity campaigns. Their names and pictures appeared in ads, interviews, photo shots, magazines, album covers, and so forth. Additionally, the touring ensemble was invited to appear on Dick Clark's American Bandstand and toured on Clark's 1964 Caravan of Stars (which included the Supremes and other notables). They also performed in the 1965 Hollywood film, A Swingin' Summer, with Raquel Welch.Summer U.S.A.! The Best of the Rip Chords, Sony Music Special Products, ¬© & (p) 2006, Sundazed Music Inc., p. 3. Therefore, very few of the music industry and the public at large realized that the touring Rip Chords and the recording Rip Chords‚Äîwith the exception of Stewart‚Äîwere not the same people.Summer U.S.A.!

The album featured balanced contributions from Stewart, Bringas, Melcher, and Johnston.Hey Little Cobra and other Hot Rod Hits, Sony Music Special Products, ¬© 1996, Sundazed Music, Inc., p 5. Of the 11 vocals, Melcher sang lead on five, Bringas sang lead on five and Stewart sang lead on one. Instrumentals by the Wrecking Crew filled out the album. Its cover listed Stewart and Bringas as vocalists, omitting Johnston and Melcher and incorrectly including Rotkin and Marcus.See the original Columbia issue of the 1964 Hey Little Cobra and other Hot Rod Hits album (CS 8951 or CL 2151). Note also there was a typo on the album cover; Bringas's first name was spelled, \\"Bernie\\".Summer U.S.A.! The Best of the Rip Chords, Sony Music Special Products, ¬© & (p) 2006, Sundazed Music Inc. = Fourth single = The group's fourth single was \\"Three Window Coupe\\", released in April 1964 with Melcher singing lead, peaking at No. 28 on the national charts.Three Window Coupe (CS 9016 or CL 2216) Sony Music Special Products, ¬© 1996, Sundazed Music, Inc., p. 4. Although all four singers contributed to the recording, the Johnston-Melcher sound predominated. Bringas and Stewart acknowledge Johnston and Melcher's vocals as a major factor in the Rip Chords' music and the California Sound. = Second album = The Three Window Coupe album (CS 9016 or CL 2216), released three weeks after the \\"Three Window Coupe\\" single, had another 11 vocals. Melcher and Bringas shared the lead on one song; of the remaining 10, Melcher sang lead on six, and Stewart and Bringas sang lead on four.Both albums also featured an instrumental by The Wrecking Crew. The instrumentals served as album fillers, but they really had nothing to do with the Rip Chords per se. Like Hey Little Cobra and other Hot Rod Hits, its liner notes erroneously listed Rotkin and Marcus as vocalists and Johnston and Melcher's vocal involvement was not mentioned. The 2006 Summer U.S.A.!

Although it reached the national charts, it failed to generate major activity. In February 1965 a final single, \\"Don't Be Scared\\", failed to chart nationally.Three Window Coupe, Sony Music Special Products, ¬© 1996, Sundazed Music, Inc., p. 5. = Breakup = Shortly after the release of \\"Don't Be Scared\\", the group disbanded after five singles on the Billboard Hot 100 and two albums reflecting the surf music of the day. Stephen J. McParland summarized, \\"But something as trendy and timely as the Rip Chords' sound and image also had a built-in clock, something like those little pop-up thermometers they used to implant in roasting chickens. When your time's up, you're done.\\" Summer U.S.A.! The Best of the Rip Chords, Sony Music Special Products, ¬© & (p) 2006, Sundazed Music Inc., p. 8. Stephen J.

Melcher, Johnston, Bringas, and Stewart recorded no music as the Rip Chords after the breakup in 1965.Stewart and Bringas did reenter the studio in 1985. They recorded two numbers that were written by Stewart; \\"Boggieboard Baby\\" and \\"1963\\". It was a private endeavor produced by Bringas. But there was no commercial distribution of the product.

Best of the Rip Chords released by Sundazed Music). The Sundazed release features the 1960s original singing Rip Chords, the Spectra release does not. As a result, founding member Bringas, who teaches religious studies at Glendale Community College in Arizona, said that misinformation, disinformation, and confusion surround the group's identity (especially on the Internet).Ernie Bringas, Jesusgate: A History Of Concealment Unraveled, October 2012, Rainbow Ridge Publishing, page 2,  Unreleased material and background vocals In 2006 Sundazed MusicSundazed Music, Inc. is an independent company that licenses Rip Chords' material from Columbia Records (Sony Music). released Summer U.S.A.!

He was elected president of the National Tuberculosis Association at the Eleventh Annual Meeting held in Seattle, Washington, in June, 1915. But his death on April 2, 1916 prevented his serving his full term. He had already served the Association as vice-president from 1913 to 1914. Early years Born in Dinaberg, Russia, May 2, 1868, the son of Bernard and Sophie Sachs, he was graduated from the Kherson High School. In 1891, he received his degree in law from the Odessa University. While at the University, he reported for military duty and was placed on the reserve list in 1887. His removal to America in 1891 was doubtless prompted by a winter's exile, imposed upon him and several fellow-students because of their participation in a debate which did not meet with the approval of the local authorities. After his arrival in the U.S., Sachs determined to study medicine, and gave up his legal career to enter the University of Illinois College of Medicine, from which he graduated in 1895. After two years of work as an intern in the Michael Reese Hospital, he entered general practice, devoting himself particularly to diseases of the lungs. Career In 1901, Sachs was appointed instructor in internal medicine at his alma mater, and in 1903 he was appointed attending physician to Cook County Hospital. Even in the earlier days of his medical career, as a struggling young practitioner endeavoring to gain a foothold, he saw how conditions were with reference to tuberculosis in Chicago at that time, and he could not refrain from doing something to help. At no little sacrifice and expense, he personally made an investigation of the prevalence of tuberculosis in some of the crowded quarters of the city, particularly in the districts where the Jewish population was in evidence. These studies, among the first of their kind, gave Sachs considerable prominence at the Sixth International Congress on Tuberculosis in 1908, and won for him special honorable mention from the jury of awards. Sachs was greatly interested in the Chicago Tuberculosis Institute, which he helped to call into life, and of which he remained one of the most active and representative workers. He served as president of the Institute from January, 1913, until his death. In the early morning of April 2, 1916, he committed suicide by taking an overdose of morphine because \\"I am simply weary. I cannot bear this longer. It has been too much.\\"The Alumni Quarterly and Fortnightly Notes, Volume 1 He was one of the most ardent advocates of the routine examinations of employees of large establishments. It was largely due to Sachs' influence that Mrs. Keith Spalding donated the funds for the Edward Sanatorium at Naperville, of which institution he became the director and physician in chief. Besides his activities in the Edward Sanatorium, he was attached to the Chicago Winfield Sanatorium, the West Side Dispensary, and the Chicago Municipal Tuberculosis Sanitarium. Concerning his interest in the latter, Dr. Philip P. Jacobs says: > Of all the many activities in which he engaged, however, none claimed so > large a share of Dr. Sachs' personality and skill as the Chicago Municipal > Tuberculosis Sanitarium. In a very real sense the Sanitarium was and is Dr. > Sachs. It breathes his personality and his genius from almost every ward and > brick. Into it he put his very body and soul. He was active in the passage > of the Glackin Law, which made the sanatorium possible. He was a prime mover > in the monstrous referendum campaign when hundreds of thousands of people > voted 'yes' for the municipal sanatorium. He was the chairman of the > Building Committee which secured the site and conceived the sanatorium long > before a brick or a stone had been laid, putting into this effort thousands > of dollars' worth of time and sacrifice, and countless miles of travel to > visit the best institutions that the world provided. Later he became > president of the board and its chief administrative director. While the > sanatorium was in construction he spent hours daily at no little sacrifice > to his practice, so that the people of Chicago should have an institution > which would be both of service for the purpose for which it was constructed > and which would not squander one dollar of the people's money. In the spring of 1915, a new administration came into office in the city of Chicago, which, it was universally admitted at the time, was responsible for Sachs' untimely death. He had made the Chicago Municipal Sanitarium an ideal institution, but the Thompson administration refused to reappoint him until practically forced to do so by the people of Chicago. Politics finally gained the upper hand, however, and Sachs was forced to resign; but even after his resignation, nefarious politics made life a burden for this brave pioneer who had unselfishly devoted the best years of his life to the welfare of the consumptive poor of the great city of Chicago. In an article entitled \\"The Civic Martyrdom of Dr. Sachs,\\" Dr. Graham Taylor, the distinguished social worker, says: > No altar of civic patriotism ever held a more loyal offering than that on > which Dr. Theodore B. Sachs sacrificed himself in life and death to save > Chicago's Municipal Tuberculosis Sanitarium from ruthless partisan > spoilsmen. In truth, many altars and offerings seemed to unite in that one > costly sacrifice. Such supreme devotion to a cause as the Jewish religious > spirit can beget, such self-sacrifice as the Russian oppression of the Jew > incites, such idealism as only the Orient inspires, such sensitivity as the > heritage of suffering weaves into the very texture of the soul, such > humanitarian achievements as are possible only in America‚Äîall combined to > make the achieving life and the tragic death of Dr. Sachs profoundly > impressive. His achievements as a clinician and specialist in tuberculosis are equal to his attainments as a propagandist and administrator. He founded the Robert Koch Society for the Study of Tuberculosis, and read before that body a number of interesting and valuable papers on the various phases of tuberculosis science. A few months before his death (February, 1916) he was elected a fellow of the Institute of Medicine in Chicago. His devotion to high ideals, his passionate love for humanity, his integrity and faithfulness to all things which he undertook, are best shown in a passage from his letter of resignation from the Municipal Sanitarium Board, wherein he said: > My service to the Sanitarium during the last six years has been prompted by > the earnest desire to give the best in me to this community in which I have > resided during the last twenty-seven years. ... I have refused to betray the > community that has given me confidence. I have great faith in the city of > Chicago and its citizens. I have passed through ten months of continuous > nightmare in trying to avert the politicalization of a great institution. > But I find it impossible to continue. Single-handed at present I cannot > fight a big political machine. In this connection the following copy of a letter which Sachs received from his patients at the Edward Sanatorium a few months before his death is significant: > We the undersigned patients of the Edward Sanatorium wish to take this > privilege of expressing our admiration for the stand you have taken in > regard to politics in connection with the Municipal Sanitarium of > Chicago‚Äîyour untiring and unselfish interest in humanity. None of the > grossly unjust criticisms of you by anyone who does not know you or your > methods will have the slightest influence on us who have implicit confidence > in your ability as a practitioner and as a man. The past records of a man > who possesses your international reputation cannot be easily tossed aside. The end came at the sanatorium of the Chicago Tuberculosis Institute in the quiet little town of Naperville. There, after his day's work in town, he sought rest all alone in the quiet of the library. And there they found him the next morning, at peace in his last sleep, which he had himself induced. The body of Sachs was interred on the grounds of the Naperville Sanatorium, and on the memorial tablet indicating the site, is the following inscription: > In Memory of DR. THEODORE B. SACHS, whose life was spent in disinterested > efforts to relieve the condition of the unfortunate, never indifferent to > the distress of others, he labored unselfishly and untiringly in their > behalf, and this Sanatorium in which ground he sleeps is a monument to his > unusual greatness of heart and singleness of purpose. He loved his neighbor > as himself and was in truth a good Samaritan. Over the portals of that other monument to Sachs' genius, the Chicago Municipal Tuberculosis Sanitarium, which had become a part of his very life, is the following inscription: \\"Conceived in boundless love of humanity and made possible by years of toil.\\" References :This article incorporates text from Sigard Adolphus Knopf's \\"A history of the National tuberculosis association: the anti-tuberculosis movement in the United States\\" (1922), now in the public domain. 1868 births 1916 deaths American pulmonologists American people of Russian-Jewish descent University of Illinois alumni University of Illinois faculty Odessa University alumni People from Naperville, Illinois Doctors who committed suicide Male suicides Suicides in Illinois ","title":"Theodore B.

His career appears to have survived Itakh's fall from power in 849,Gordon, p. 113 and in 856 he was selected to govern Egypt on behalf of the Abbasid prince al-Muntasir, who had been assigned the province as part of the caliph al-Mutawakkil's succession arrangements.Tabari, v. 34: pp. 95-6 Yazid's tenure as governor was characterized by a lack of stability in the country. In Upper Egypt, rebellious Arab tribes had effectively seized control of the area around Aswan. In the north, Yazid was concerned with keeping dissent followers of Ali in check. Several Alawis were arrested and deported to Samarra, and the central government sent him instructions to severely limit the freedoms Alids and their supporters in the province. In 866 a revolt in the region of Alexandria was begun by one Jabir ibn al-Walid and enjoyed the support of the local Arabs, Christians and mawƒÅlƒ´. Soon the rebels had spread across the Delta region and defeated the Turkish garrison stationed at Fustat. As a result of Yazid's failure to suppress the rebellion, he was recalled from his post by the central government in 867.Brett, pp. 589-91 Part of the reason for Yazid's failure was that his powers as governor were limited. He had been given responsibility for Fustat and the Nile districts, but Alexandria and Barqa had been removed from the jurisdiction of the Egyptian government and were separately administered at the time. In addition, in accordance with the normal practice of the era, Yazid had control over the military and administration of the province, but not its fiscal affairs; these were delegated to a separate director of finance ('ƒÅmil).Gordon, p. 110; Brett, p. 589; Bianquis, p. 92 From 861 on this latter post was occupied by Ahmad ibn al-Mudabbir, whose heavy taxes likely exacerbated the feelings of discontent among the populace.Brett, p. 590; Gottschalk, p. 880 Yazid was replaced as governor by Muzahim ibn Khaqan, who had been dispatched to the province with reinforcements to put down Jabir's rebellion.

It operates under the Eastern Naval Command of the Indian Navy. The air station will be opened up for civilian flights under Phase 2 of the Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS) of the Government of India also known as UDAN and the Airports Authority of India (AAI) has started preparatory work at the airstrip. History The airfield in Ramanathapuram was previously the abandoned Ramnad Civil Aerodrome. Naval aviation first utilised the facilities in 1982, to monitor the Palk Strait in the wake of the Sri Lankan Civil War. The facilities were fully transferred to the Navy on 9 June 1985, and the naval air station was initially commissioned INS Rajali II. On 26 March 2009, the base was renamed and commissioned as INS Parundu, for the Tamil word for an eagle. The facilities have since been upgraded to operate larger aircraft. It is primarily used by the navy as a reconnaissance station to monitor the South East Bay of Bengal, the northern Indian Ocean, the Gulf of Mannar and the Palk Strait. On 25 August 2017, an Integrated Automatic Aviation Meteorological System (IAAMS) was added. Units The primary units based at INS Parundu are Naval Air Squadrons (INAS) that operate HAL Chetak helicopters, Islander and Dornier Do 228 reconnaissance aircraft. Besides upgrading the runway, the Navy has installed dedicated facilities to operate UAVs from the air station. INAS 344, operating IAI Heron and IAI Searcher Mk II UAVs is based at INS Parundu.

Mosaica Education was founded in 1997. It acquired Advantage Schools, Inc., in 2001. Mosaica Education's primary focus is developing charter school programs in the United States that use its proprietary Paragon curriculum. Mosaica Education is co-headquartered in New York City and Atlanta, Georgia. The organization employs more than 1,800 people, primarily at the school-site level, and operates 104 programs for 25,000 students worldwide as of November 2013. Michael J. Connelly is Mosaica's chief executive officer. The company's educational assets were taken over by Pansophic Learning in 2015. No Mosaica- branded schools remain. History =Early history= Mosaica was co-founded in 1997 by Dr. Dawn Eidelman and Gene Eidelman. The Eidelmans had previously founded Prodigy Child Development Centers and Prodigy Consulting, an organization that operated child development and care centers in the Atlanta, Georgia area and for corporations across the United States including General Motors, IBM and Xerox. Dr. Dawn Eidelman also formerly served as a professor at the University of Texas at Arlington. In September 1997, Mosaica opened its first charter school. Lepercq Capital Management purchased a stake of the company in 1998. Along with the investment, Michael Connelly, a former president of Lepercq, became Mosaica's chief executive officer. The company received further funding from Murphy and Partners in 1999. =2000s= In 2001, Mosaica acquired Advantage Schools, a Boston, Massachusetts-based education management organization. The Qatari government contracted Mosaica to convert schools in Qatar to an American-style educational curriculum in 2003. The contract was renewed in 2006. By 2005, Mosaica was the fastest growing urban business in the country, according to Inc. Magazine. The company operated 51 charter schools at the time. In 2004 and 2007, Mosaica was recognized as one of the Outstanding Charters Schools in America. Mosaica was one of two education organizations to appear on the 2004 \\"Inc 5000\\" list. In 2006, Mosaica Education was selected by the government of Abu Dhabi as one of four private education firms to consult on 30 government schools in the Abu Dhabi Education Council (ADEC). The Public-Private Partnership (PPP) program was considered successful in 2010 when ADEC reported that \\"there has been a considerable rise in student and teacher attendance and grades specifically in English, Math, and Arabic language skills.\\" In 2006, Mosaica was paid $773,000 for the first year of a five-year management contract for the management of Lafayette Academy Charter School in New Orleans, Louisiana. The organization was fired in 2007 by the school's governing board, which alleged that Mosaica failed to align its curriculum to Louisiana state standards, provide after- school programs for students that were below grade level, and organize transportation to and from the school. The dispute between Mosaica and Lafayette Academy went into arbitration. In September 2007, the arbitrator ruled Lafayette Academy would pay Mosaica $100,000 for early termination of the contract and Mosaica would return $350,000 in fees to the school. In 2009, Mosaica fired one school administrator and two teachers at Howard Road Academy, a charter school managed by the organization. The administrator had leaked a copy of the DC-CAS standardized test to two teachers, who then distributed copies of the test to their students prior to the exam day. =2010s= In 2010, the MAPSA (Michigan Association of Public School Academies) recognized Bingham Arts with the Charter School of Excellence Award for the state of Michigan. The Columbus Preparatory Academy was recognized as a 'School of Excellence with Distinction' by the Ohio Department of Education in 2011. In 2012, a charter school managed by Mosaica Education received the Illinois State Board of Education's \\"Academic Improvement Award.\\" A charter school managed by Mosaica Education received the 2012 Colorado \\"Governors' Distinguished Improvement Award\\" for exceeding academic expectations. In April 2012, the Winston-Salem Journal reported that the STEAM Academy of Winston- Salem, North Carolina had faced declining revenue and poor academic performance for multiple years. Mosaica took over management of the charter school in late 2011. The STEAM Academy's board of directors hired Susan Willis to serve as the school's principal in December of that year. Willis had been fired in 2009 from Fleming High School in Roanoke, Virginia for allegedly manipulating student schedules to influence the school's standardized testing scores. Mosaica was aware of Willis' firing but felt that Willis was \\"cleared of any wrongdoing\\" after the company spoke to a former Roanoke school superintendent and consulted a dissenting opinion from the Virginia state investigation into Willis' conduct. Also in 2012, Mosaica was contracted to manage a charter district in Muskegon Heights, Michigan by Donald Weatherspoon, the emergency manager of the failing district. Prior to contracting with Mosaica, Weatherspoon had fired the entire staff of the school district and reconstituted it as a charter district. Mosaica had \\"three months to hire and train staff members, including those rehired from the old district, bring neglected facilities up to code, and persuade parents to keep their children enrolled.\\" The school's first principal quit within the first month of that school year and, within three months, a quarter of the teachers hired by Mosaica in the summer had left the district. According to Education Week, \\"the largest single proportion [of teachers who left the district]‚Äî28 percent‚Äîcited the charter district's lack of participation in Michigan's public school employee retirement plan as the reason [for leaving].\\" In 2013, a charter school managed by Mosaica Education is recognized by the Ohio Department of Education as a \\"High Progress School of Honor.\\" As of 2013, Atlanta Preparatory Academy, a charter school managed by Mosaica, ranked in the bottom 20% of schools in Georgia based on standardized testing scores. Atlanta Public Schools recommended that the Georgia Board of Education not renew the school's charter due to low standardized test scores. The public school district was also concerned that the charter school's board lacked sufficient independence because it owed $801,384 to Mosaica. In 2014, Tatonka Capital sued Mosaica, claiming default on loans. Mosaica went into court- ordered receivership in September 2014. In 2015, Tatonka and Pansophic Learning acquired the company's assets out of bankruptcy. Divisions Mosaica Education is the parent organization that manages US-based charter schools and provides education consulting services. Additionally, there are five divisions within the organization: Mosaica Online Mosaica Online (formerly known as Mercury Online Education) is a virtual education program available to students domestically and internationally. Students attend classes and interact with peers and teachers through an online learning management system. In addition to offering virtual schools, Mosaica Online also partners with schools looking to offer online courses on an √† la carte basis. Mosaica Turnaround Partners Mosaica Turnaround Partners is a consultant for schools and school districts facing a wide range of educational challenges. Mosaica Turnaround Partners assist school administrators with rescuing their academic programs from failure. Mosaica Turnaround Partners use professional development, research and tracking to improve the academic achievement of schools focusing on predominantly at risk student populations. Mosaica International Schools Mosaica International Schools (formerly known as Mosaica American Schools) is Mosaica Education's division that operates private international schools located outside of the United States. Mosaica currently operates one school in Hyderabad, India, although a school in Gurgaon had been planned in 2011. Mosaica Education UK Mosaica Education UK provides school management, professional development and education consulting services to schools and governments within the United Kingdom. At present Mosaica Education UK operates four academies in England under the Aurora Academies Trust. Paragon Paragon is an accelerated learning program that replaces traditional social studies, history, geography and civics curriculum at the primary and secondary school levels. Paragon also integrates the Visual and Performing Arts. Paragon supports scholarship in all subject areas by emphasizing pedagogies such as inquiry-based learning. Paragon was developed by Dr. Dawn Eidelman and is one of the eight pillars in Mosaica's accredited school model. Paragon One distinction of Mosaica Education is the use of its proprietary Paragon curriculum instead of traditional social studies in nearly all of its schools. Paragon was designed by Mosaica's co-founder Dr. Dawn Eidelman. In a Michigan Radio article, some Mosaica students described the program as fun. The same article quotes a former teacher as saying that Paragon has a one-size-fits-all approach that incorporated a \\"strict\\" teaching schedule making it hard for students to gain an understanding of the material or develop teacher / student relationships. An article published in May 2013 in The Observer commented that the Paragon curriculum appeared to be at odds with British Secretary of State for Education Michael Gove's views of how history should be taught in the [British] curriculum. Gove's comment pertained to secondary students. The article also referred to a 2003 study conducted by the American Federation of Teachers union, which suggested that self- evaluation measures taken by the school to demonstrate Paragon effectiveness had inflated student scores, a claim denied by the organization. In February 2014, the Manav Rachna International School - Charmwood, which uses Paragon curriculum, received the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India (ASSOCHAM) National Education Excellence Award for the \\"Best K-12 School in Teaching and Learning Practices.\\" In May 2014, the UK Office of Standards in Education (Ofsted) changed its rating of King Offa Primary Academy from \\"Special Measures\\" to \\"Good\\" and praised its use of Paragon curriculum. Awards and recognition In 2000, co-founder Dr. Dawn Eidelman received the Ten Outstanding Young Americans (TOYA) Award. In 2003, the United States Department of Education recognized Mosaica Education as an \\"Education Innovator\\". Mosaica was recognized on the Inner-City 100 list for 4 consecutive years (2004‚Äì2007), including the #1 spot in 2005. Mosaica appeared on the 2005, 2007, 2009, and 2010 \\"Inc. 5000\\" list.

Besides its primary function as a home for the performing arts, the two-and-a-half- story building has housed the offices of Cedarville's mayor and village council, its jail, its fire and police departments, its waterworks, and its library, as well as the township trustees' office for Cedarville Township. When Cedarville's was built, the opera house as an institution was a center of social life in rural Ohio: the public sphere was nearly nonexistent except for the village opera house, which typically served as a meeting place for travelling vaudeville acts, political events, musical performances, and graduation ceremonies. Because the first floor has always been used as offices for the various organizations that used the building, public events were typically held on the second floor, which has been little modified by the years; it is one of Ohio's least changed historic performance halls. In 1984, the Cedarville Opera House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, qualifying both because of its historically significant architecture and because of its place in local history. It is one of two National Register- listed properties in Cedarville and one of two National Register-listed opera houses in Greene County, along with the Harper Mausoleum and George W.

On August 25, 2020, President Donald Trump announced his intention to nominate Wolf to become the 7th Secretary of DHS, after the Trump administration disputed GAO claims that he has illegally served as Acting DHS Secretary since November 2019 as his succession to the role was improper. A member of the Republican Party, Wolf previously served in several positions in the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), including as Chief of Staff of the Transportation Security Administration and Chief of Staff to DHS secretary Kirstjen Nielsen. He was an architect of the Trump administration family separation policy in 2018, and was prominently involved in the deployment of federal law enforcement forces in Portland and elsewhere beginning in July 2020. In September 2020, Wolf was accused of having ordered staff to stop reporting on threats from Russia. From 2005 to 2016, Wolf was a lobbyist, helping clients secure contracts from the Transportation Security Administration, his previous employer.  Education and early career  Wolf was born in Jackson, Mississippi, and grew up in Plano, Texas. He graduated from Plano East Senior High School and then attended Collin College on a tennis scholarship. He then transferred to Southern Methodist University, where he earned a B.A. in U.S. history. Wolf worked as a staffer for Republican Senators Phil Gramm, Kay Bailey Hutchison, and then Chuck Hagel, for whom he worked for two-and-a-half years. From 2002 to 2005, he worked in the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), becoming Assistant Administrator for Transportation Security Policy in 2005. During this time he first worked with Kirstjen Nielsen. Lobbyist career From October 2005 to 2016, he was Vice President and Senior Director at Wexler & Walker, a now defunct lobbying firm. He helped clients obtain contracts from the TSA, his previous employer. In 2013 he received a Master Certificate in government contract management from Villanova University. Return to government In March 2017 Wolf became Chief of Staff of the Transportation Security Administration. He served in that position for four months, and then became DHS Deputy Chief of Staff and the top aide to Deputy Secretary Elaine Duke. In 2018 he became Chief of Staff of DHS under Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen. While working for Nielsen, he was an early architect of the family separation policy. He later testified to Congress that his function was to provide information to the Secretary and \\"not to determine whether it was the right or wrong policy,\\" though he agreed with the decision to end the policy. He also testified that he was not involved in the initial development of the policy by the Executive Office of the President and the Attorney General, though this statement was disputed based on internal documents. He then became Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security for Strategy, Plans, Analysis & Risk, a Senior Executive Service position not subject to Senate confirmation. He concurrently served as Acting Under Secretary of Homeland Security for Strategy, Policy, and Plans. He was nominated in February 2019 to serve permanently in the Under Secretary role, and his confirmation hearing was held that June, but the nomination was delayed by Senator Jacky Rosen to protest poor conditions for children at DHS facilities.  Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Wolf is sworn in as Under Secretary of Homeland Security for Strategy, Policy, and Plans with his family in 2019 COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020 = Appointment = Wolf's appointment as Acting Secretary of Homeland Security came after the departure of Kevin McAleenan was announced on November 1, 2019. At the time, he was not considered the first choice for the job, and it has been reported that he was satisfied with his policy job at the time, but others favored by Trump such as Ken Cuccinelli and Mark Morgan were ineligible for the Acting Secretary position. The fact that he had previously lobbied for the National Association of Software and Services Companies, which was in favor of the H-1B visa program, led to criticism from groups favoring more restrictive immigration policies. But the Trump administration defended his record and privately asked Republican senators not to oppose his appointment. The administration waited for Wolf's confirmation as Under Secretary before appointing him Acting Secretary to avoid appointing him as a principal officer from a non-Senate-confirmed position, which many scholars and former government officials have argued is unconstitutional. DHS then had to move the Under Secretary position earlier in the line of succession, because the 210-day period in which an acting official may be named without a pending permanent nomination had expired, mandating that the Secretary's duties must be performed by the department's seniormost confirmed official. Wolf was confirmed as Under Secretary on November 13, 2019, on a 54‚Äì41 vote, and was sworn in as acting secretary of DHS the same day.  Dispute  On November 15, 2019, House Democrats Bennie Thompson and Carolyn Maloney requested that the Comptroller General of the United States review the legality of Wolf's appointment on the basis that former Acting Secretary McAleenan did not have authority to change the department's line of succession, asserting that former Secretary Nielsen had not properly placed McAleenan first in the line of succession before resigning and that McAleenan's change came after the 210-day limit to his authority had expired. In July 2020, University of Michigan law professor Nina Mendelson, an expert on federal vacancies, asserted that an Acting Secretary can serve for only 210 days following vacancy by a Senate-confirmed officeholder. The last Senate- confirmed DHS Secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen, stepped down on April 10, 2019, 469 days earlier. On August 14, 2020, the Government Accountability Office released a finding that Wolf had become Acting Secretary improperly, noting that: > Upon Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen's resignation on April 10, 2019, the > official who assumed the title of Acting Secretary had not been designated > in the order of succession to serve upon the Secretary's resignation. > Because the incorrect official assumed the title of Acting Secretary at that > time, subsequent amendments to the order of succession made by that official > were invalid and officials who assumed their positions under such > amendments, including Chad Wolf and Kenneth Cuccinelli, were named by > reference to an invalid order of succession. Under the valid line of succession, the Acting Secretary would be Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Pete Gaynor. On September 11, 2020, a federal judge ruled that Wolf is likely unlawfully serving as acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. On that basis, the court issued an order barring the enforcement of rules Wolf had created.https://asylumadvocacy.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Casa-de- Maryland-v-Wolf-Memorandum-Opinion-on-PI.pdf = Tenure = Wolf maintained a low public profile during the early part of his term, prior to his prominent involvement in the deployment of federal law enforcement forces in Portland, Oregon, and elsewhere beginning in July 2020. In February 2020, Wolf announced that the Trump administration was revoking New York residents' ability to participate in Global Entry and other Trusted Traveler programs, in response to the state's \\"sanctuary\\" immigration policies, which DHS said jeopardized the government's ability to effectively vet travelers.Nick Miroff, Trump suspends Global Entry, traveler programs for New York residents over 'sanctuary' policies , The Washington Post (February 5, 2020).Abigail Hauslohner, The Trump administration punished New York for its sanctuary policy. New York is suing. , The Washington Post (February 7, 2020).Geneva Sands, Global Entry to stay banned for NY until state grants access to DMV database, says DHS secretary , CNN (February 7, 2020). The move prompted the State of New York to sue the administration. In July 2020, lawyers for the Trump administration informed the court that DHS officials had made false statements to justify excluding New York residents from the Trusted Traveler programs, admitting the inaccuracies \\"undermine a central argument\\" in their case.Ed Shanahan and Zolan Kanno-Youngs, Homeland Security Dept. Admits Making False Statements in Fight With N.Y. , The New York Times (July 23, 2020). New York subsequently changed its law that had prevented sharing of information with federal law enforcement officers to expressly allow for information- sharing of NY DMV records ‚Äúas necessary for an individual seeking acceptance into a trusted traveler program, or to facilitate vehicle imports and/or exports‚Äù, and the DHS then removed the Global Entry restrictions. In July 2020, Wolf sent federal agents dressed in camouflage and tactical gear to Portland, Oregon, where they used tear gas on protesters. Agents also used unmarked vehicles to detain protesters, and the protesters claimed the agents did not identify themselves as law enforcement, although DHS said the agents identified themselves. Legal observers called this \\"abduction\\" and \\"kidnapping\\". Oregon Governor Kate Brown called the actions an \\"abuse of power\\" and accused Wolf of \\"provoking confrontation for political purposes\\". Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler called it \\"an attack on our democracy\\". Wolf alleged the protesters were a \\"violent mob\\" and \\"violent anarchists\\". The New York Times reported that an internal DHS memo presented to Wolf before the deployment said the federal agents in question had not been specifically trained in riot control or mass demonstrations. Wolf was criticized for taking unauthorized photographs inside the courthouse, contrary to local and national court policy. Tom Ridge, the first head of DHS, sharply criticized the deployment, saying, \\"The department was established to protect America from the ever-present threat of global terrorism. It was not established to be the president's personal militia.\\" Ridge, the former governor of Pennsylvania, added that it would be a \\"cold day in hell\\" before he would have consented as a governor to such a deployment. In a July 21 press conference, Wolf defended the deployment of officers in unmarked military-style uniforms, saying they had identifying numbers on their shoulders. But former Trump administration DHS spokesman David Lapan disputed that the officers are easy to identify, saying, \\"People like me, who served a long time, have to look very long and hard to figure out who these people are. For the average citizen, it looks like the military is being used to suppress American citizens. Even if that's not the case, and this is law enforcement, it creates the impression that the military is being used.\\" In a Fox News interview on the same day, Wolf claimed it was necessary for the federal government to \\"proactively arrest individuals.\\" The Washington Post reported in July 2020 that Trump had told his aides that he liked Wolf more than his predecessors because his predecessors pushed back on Trump's expansive view of federal power. Wolf was also reported to have a good relationship with White House advisor Stephen Miller. According to a whistleblower complaint released in September 2020, Wolf ordered DHS's intelligence branch to stop producing intelligence reports on Russian interference in the 2020 election and not to disseminate those reports because they \\"made the president look bad.\\" In September 2020, Wolf defied a subpoena to testify before Congress. = Nomination to permanent appointment = On August 25, 2020, President Trump announced that he will nominate Wolf as the permanent Secretary of Homeland Security. Wolf is expected to continue to serve as Acting Secretary during the confirmation process, as his acting appointment was made under the Homeland Security Act of 2002 and not the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998, which prevents most nominees from simultaneously acting in the same position. On September 10, 2020, the nomination was formally submitted to the Senate. =Reported interference with intelligence= In September 2020, Wolf was publicly accused of having ordered staff to stop reporting on threats from Russia. In Spring 2020, Wolf, communicating through White House national security adviser Robert C. O‚ÄôBrien, allegedly ordered former head of DHS intelligence Brian Murphy to focus his reports on Iran and China. Wolf also allegedly told Murphy not to expose the Russian origins of an anti-Biden disinformation campaign because the exposure \\"made the president look bad.\\" Murphy was demoted in August to DHS management division, and filed a whistleblower complaint on September 8, which was released publicly the next day.  Personal life  Wolf is married and has two sons.

Career He would mainly drive the Buick vehicles sponsored by Miller High Life. In addition to his Winston Cup Series starts, Insolo would make 129 appearances in a Chevrolet vehicle at the Winston West division of NASCAR. Insolo finished an average of 21st place after starting an average of 13th. His only DNQ came at the 1972 Miller High Life 500. Jimmy's total earnings as a driver were $59,785 ($ when adjusted for inflation). One of his famous races involved Insolo racing at the Westwood Motorsport Park (now developed into the Westwood Plateau neighborhood along with the Westwood Plateau Golf & Country Club). Before Insolo stepped onto the NASCAR scene, very few West Coast drivers had any level of success in NASCAR. Drivers from that part of the United States were forced by necessity to race in the specially-designated Winston West Series. Racing in the Southeastern United States back in the early days of NASCAR was a financially unsustainable activity that brought about meager amounts of money that probably couldn't feed the family or pay the bills back then. The multimillion-dollar purses that make up the basis for today's NASCAR Cup Series races didn't appear until at least the 1980s. For example, the 1955 Southern 500, one of the highest paying events prior to the inaugural running of the Daytona 500 paid only $50 as its lowest prize ($ when adjusted for inflation). Insolo would race in the days before Kevin Harvick, Ron Hornaday, and Kurt Busch made NASCAR into a household name west of the Mississippi River. Derrike Cope, Ernie Irvan, and Chad Little would become a few of his \\"West Coast\\" contemporaries. After racing the equivalent of and leading 24 laps out of 2804, Insolo would retire from his NASCAR career. He was the 1978 NASCAR Winston West Series champion. Awards Insolo was inducted in the West Coast Stock Car Hall of Fame in its first class (2002).

Qamrood area is one of those areas that retained elements from the days of the early period of civilization's presence. The first ancient prayers on the Iranian plateau were made in this area. Some historians have attributed the original construction of this area to Alexander, Bohram Gore, Tahmurth, Lhrassap, Ghobad Sassanid, Yazdgerd III, and several others, and there are disagreements over this. Archaeologists such as Roman Cirsman consider Qom to be the oldest region in which human beings have settled there and have established the first civilizations. New archaeological results also date the Qomrud region more than 7,000 years ago. Archaeologists claim that due to the existence of the Qamrood River and the presence of the Shah, the roadway of the Silk Road has been the source of civilizations since the early days of history. In the region, about 130 ancient works, mostly belonging to the Sassanid and Parthian era, have been identified.

Since 2010, the company has begun adding other computer components to its portfolio, including gaming laptops, power supplies, All-In-One Liquid Coolers, computer cases and gaming mice. Founded in July 1999, its headquarters is in Brea, California.  Products  EVGA products include motherboards, graphic cards (including factory-overclocked models), power supply units and related accessories. Initially motherboards were limited to NVIDIA reference designs, but expanded to non-reference designs based on NVIDIA chipsets, and are based on Intel chipsets following the exit of NVIDIA from the motherboard market. The first EVGA motherboard based on an Intel chipset was the X58 SLI, supporting 3-way SLI, and was announced in November 2008. Factory-overclocked graphics cards included the SC, SSC and FTW editions (as well as special KO editions in the past). Other products, such as specialized VGA coolers and VGA water blocks, are also available from EVGA. In March 2009, EVGA released the X58 Classified (E759), an EVGA specialized board with a NVIDIA NF200 chip (the E760 Classified does not have the NF200 chip). It is an Intel X58-chipset based motherboard with many overclocking-friendly features. In September 2009, EVGA released the world's first 4-way SLI capable motherboard (XL-ATX form factor) which allows up to four GPUs to run in a 4-way SLI configuration. The first graphics processing unit to support 4-way SLI was the EVGA GTX 285 Classified; more recent GPUs like the GTX 980 also support 4-way SLI. The company also released a dual-socket motherboard based on the Intel 5520 chipset with overclocking features. Named Classified SR-2, this motherboard supports dual Socket LGA 1366 Xeon-based Intel CPUs and 4-way SLI. It was the first HPTX form factor motherboard. In August 2010, EVGA released the Classified SR-2 power supply with 1200 Watts of continuous power and 6 +12 V rails, each capable of delivering 38 A. In May 2011, EVGA entered the CPU air cooler market with the introduction of the Superclock CPU Cooler. In November 2013, EVGA released its first tablet computer, the EVGA Tegra Note 7, in the United States. It is a 7-inch Android tablet powered by a Tegra 4 processor. In May 2016, EVGA released its first gaming laptop called the EVGA SC17.  Customer support  As of January 1, 2009, EVGA has officially agreed to honor all warranties in the Asia/Pacific Regions of the world. Products returned under warranty are replaced with the same model. If the same model is no longer available, the product is replaced with a product of equal or greater performance. Refunds are only offered on products purchased directly from EVGA within 30 days of purchase. Products purchased since July 1, 2011 are automatically covered by EVGA's 'Global Warranty Policy', which stipulates a minimum warranty period of 3 years for all products regardless of region or method of purchase. The warranty coverage is transferable between owners and product registration is optional. Warranty starts when item is sold from an official re-seller to anybody else. If somebody buys from an unofficial re- seller, warranty will be less than 3 years. Product can even come with zero warranty. On August 24, 2018 EVGA altered its warranty requirements for new EVGA products purchased after May 25th 2018. A proof of purchase must be included for warranty purposes, even if within the manufacture warranty validity period. An additional request from EVGA for secondhand owners is to prove that the products was bought from the original owner. It is still unknown how this change will affect the financials of the company, in a competitive hardware arena with other major companies present, such as Asus, Gigabyte, Palit and others. = Step-Up program = EVGA offers a program called \\"Step-Up\\", whereby users of select graphics cards purchased from certain vendors may upgrade their GPUs to more advanced models at a discount equivalent to the cost of the original card. The Step-Up period runs for 90 days after the original purchase if the product is registered within the first 14 days. In addition, purchasing an extended warranty within the first 90 days will grant the user the option to participate in the Step-Up program until the end of the 90 day period.

The Academy's aim is \\"to identify, award, promote, and celebrate Australia's greatest achievements in film and television\\". It was established in August 2011 with the backing of the Australian Film Institute (AFI) to act as its industry engagement arm and to administer the AACTA Awards (formerly the Australian Film Institute Awards, also known as the AFI Awards) which rewards achievements in Australian feature film, television, documentary and short films. The Academy is composed of 15 Chapters, each of which represents different screen artists including actors, directors, producers and writers, and it is overseen by the Academy's president and the Honorary Council. Australian actor Geoffrey Rush is the inaugural President and hosted the inaugural AACTA Awards in January 2012. Background The Australian Academy of Cinema and Television Arts (AACTA), is a not for profit, membership based, organisation whose aim is \\"to identify, award, promote and celebrate Australia's greatest achievements in film and television.\\" The Academy is a subsidiary of the Australian Film Institute (AFI), a non-profit organisation which was established in 1958 to develop an active film culture in Australia and to foster engagement between the general public and the Australian film industry. The AFI was also responsible for administering the Australian Film Institute Awards (more commonly known as the AFI Awards), which until 2011 rewarded Australian practitioners in feature film, television, documentary and short film screen crafts. The Academy receives funding by the AFI, and Australian state and federal governments. In June 2011, the AFI proposed the establishment of an \\"Australian Academy\\". The objectives for the proposed academy was to raise the profile of Australian film and television in Australia and abroad, and to change the way it rewards talent by mimicking the methods used in foreign film organisations, such as Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) and British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA). The voting system would change through the establishment of an \\"Honorary Council\\", which will govern fifteen chapters composed of professionals from industry guilds and organisations including actors, directors, producers and screenwriters. It was also stated that the Academy would not replace the AFI and past winners of the AFI Awards would \\"[...] constitute the founding heritage of an 'Australian Academy.'\\" When the announcement of the proposal was made, the AFI began the consultation phase where members of the public and screen industry gave their feedback on the proposed changes throughout June, 2011. Of the announcement Damian Trewhella, CEO of the AFI said, \\"We thought a better way to engage with the industry would be to try and improve our professional membership structure[...] It's quite a big improvement on the way the AFI does things.\\" By 20 July, weeks after the consultation period ended, the AFI announced that it would go ahead with the proposed changes and the Australian Academy. When asked about the timing of the announcement Trewhella stated that, \\"Based on the overwhelming industry support we have received, we are now confident that we are moving in the right direction, and therefore that we can move briskly to establish the initial phase of the Academy.\\" On 18 August 2011, the AFI announced, in a special event at the Sydney Opera House, that the academy would be called the Australian Academy of Cinema and Television Arts (AACTA) and the inaugural awards ceremony would be renamed the AACTA Awards, but serve as a continuum to the annual AFI Awards. During the event it was also made known that the president of the inaugural awards would be Geoffrey Rush. On the night a new gold statuette was revealed, created by Australian sculptor Ron Gomboc, which depicts \\"a human silhouette based on the shape of the Southern Cross constellation.\\" Structure The Academy, which has between 1,500 and 2,000 members, comprises fifteen Chapters, with each representing a different area of speciality in feature film, television, documentary and short film. It is overseen by the Academy's president and the Honorary Council. The role of the Honorary Council is to determine policies and strategies for the way the Academy rewards practitioners. The Chapters are as follows: *Actors *Animation *Cinematographers *Composers *Costume Designers *Directors *Editors *Executives *Hair and Make-up Artists *Media and Public Relations *Producers *Production Designers *Screenwriters *Sound *Visual and Special Effects President, Patron, Ambassador AACTA - Our People * Geoffrey Rush (2011-2017) * Dr. George Miller - patron * Cate Blanchett - ambassador Honorary Councillors * Stuart Beattie, 2011‚Äìpresent * Jan Chapman, 2011‚Äìpresent * Jonathan Chissick, 2011‚Äìpresent * Abbie Cornish, 2011‚Äìpresent * Rolf de Heer, 2011‚Äìpresent * Elizabeth Drake, 2011‚Äìpresent * Adam Elliot, 2011‚Äìpresent *Antony I.

The festival marks the beginning of the Australian film awards season, and members of the Academy can commence voting for films in all categories, while members of the Institute vote for the Best Short Animation, Best Short Fiction Film and Members' Choice Award only. =Awards= The AACTA Awards replaced the previous Australian Film Institute Awards, but serve as a continuum to past ceremonies. The awards were first instituted by the Australian Film Institute in 1958 (as the Australian Film Awards) as part of the Melbourne International Film Festival, until 1972. Before 1969, awards were presented as a prize to non-feature films due to a lack of feature films produced in Australia. By 1976 competitive film awards were established and in 1987, awards for television was introduced. The awards were usually held at the end of each year in Melbourne but, prior to the announcement of the Academy, the AFI announced that it would move the awards to January 2012 at the Sydney Opera House, in order to align them with the international film awards season. The awards are held over two events: the AACTA Awards Luncheon, a black tie event where accolades are handed out for non-feature and short films, film production, non-drama related television programs and the Raymond Longford Award, and the AACTA Awards Ceremony which hands out the awards in all other categories at a larger venue and is broadcast on television. Additionally, awards for achievements in foreign film were presented once at the AACTA International Awards in Los Angeles in 2012.

Rubel (April 27, 1920 ‚Äì January 13, 2015) was a business executive in the early post-World War II years of the defense electronics industry, later serving as Assistant Secretary of Defense in the Kennedy administration. He is regarded as one of Robert McNamara's so-called whiz kids and was an early proponent of geosynchronous communications satellites. Rubel was born in Chicago to a well-to-do Jewish family of German origins. Following the death of his father in 1927, he moved with his mother to Los Angeles, where he attended public schools and graduated from Los Angeles High School. His undergraduate degree, in engineering, was from Caltech, in 1942. As a sole surviving son (his brother, Robert Jack Rubel having been killed in action) Rubel could not enlist in World War II. To contribute to the war effort, Rubel and his wife Dorothy moved to Schenectady, New York, where he was a junior engineer at General Electric. Immediately after the war, he returned to Southern California to work for Lockheed Corporation as an engineer. In 1948, Rubel joined what was essentially a start up company within Howard Hughes' industrial empire, an organization that eventually became Hughes Electronics (then a new word). By 1956, at the age of 36, he was directing most of the avionics business and managing 2000 people. Featured in a Hughes advertisement as \\"the new man\\" (that is, leader in a field that had not existed only a decade earlier‚Äîdefense electronics) he began to gain national prominence. (Rubel states that Howard Hughes personally did not like the advertising campaign, which was summarily dropped.) In 1959, still during the Eisenhower administration, Rubel was invited to become Assistant Director (to Herbert York) of Defense Research and Engineering in the Pentagon. When, after Kennedy's election, Robert McNamara became Secretary of Defense, Rubel was kept on as Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, one of few outsiders to join the ranks of McNamara's whiz kids. As Assistant Secretary of Defense, Rubel is most remembered for his early sponsorship and support of spin-stabilized geosynchronous communications satellites (notably SYNCOM I and SYNCOM II), leading directly to the government charter of COMSAT Corporation (now a unit of Lockheed Martin Corporation), the founding of the Hughes satellite manufacturing business (now a part of Boeing Corporation), and the creation of today's satellite communications industry. He also sponsored the creation of the Titan III space launch vehicle, which became a workhorse of the space industry. After leaving the Pentagon in 1963, Rubel worked for 10 years for Litton Industries. He supervised the design of what is regarded as the world's first highly automated modern shipyard using serial production methods to produce large ships at Pascagoula, Mississippi. This shipyard, now a subsidiary of Huntington Ingalls Corp., is a major private employer on the Gulf coast. Among its first large production contracts the new shipyard produced a fleet of five LHAs (Landing Helicopter Assault ships), designed under Rubel's direction, ships with the displacement weight of a small aircraft carrier. A significant majority of U.S. Navy's surface warships have been produced in this shipyard since production began in the early 1970s. References * Barton C. Hacker and James M.

It is located at the junction of State Highway 37 and Farm Road 71, eleven miles northwest of the county seat, Mount Vernon. The name derives from an early settler by the name of Hagan, who established a crossing on the Sulphur River. Hagan's Port eventually became one word, Hagansport. This was the spelling of the name by the time the first post office was established in 1857. The community grew to around 150 by the 1880s and had a post office, school, gin, sawmill, and other businesses. The population has gradually declined since then, resulting in the closing of the post office and school. In 2000, the population was estimated at forty. As of 2010, Hagansport had three churches, a community center, a cemetery, and one general store. It is also the site of the Annual Hagansport Fall Farm Equipment and Horse Auction which draws visitors from all over East Texas.

It was part of District XI of the Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association (PIAA). History There had been widespread discussion about high school league realignment in the Lehigh Valley starting in late 1990 or early 1991. It was in the fall of 1993 that the formation of the Mountain Valley Conference was announced. The new league comprised all the public high schools in Monroe County at the time: Stroudsburg, East Stroudsburg, Pocono Mountain, and Pleasant Valley High Schools, plus Nazareth and Northampton High Schools from Northampton County. Lehighton Area High School would also join the new league, giving it an initial membership of seven schools when competition began with the 1994-95 school year. After the 1997-98 school year, the MVC added more schools in Lehigh and Northampton Counties: Easton Area, Freedom, Liberty, Parkland, and Whitehall all joined the league. After 2001-02 the seven schools in Lehigh and Northampton Counties left the league to help form the Lehigh Valley Conference. East Stroudsburg school district had opened a new high school near the turn of the century, and Pocono Mountain district opened a new high school in 2002; both new schools were added to the MVC for the start of the 2002-03 school year. MVC membership has been stable from 2002 to 2012. Starting in 2012, Dieruff High School and William Allen High School joined the MVC as associate members for football only. All schools voted to allow both Allentown teams into the conference with only Lehighton voting against it. The teams will stay a part of the Mountain Valley Conference for a maximum of four years. Starting in the 2014-2015 school year, the six Monroe County schools became part of the Lehigh Valley Conference, expanding that conference to a large 18-team \\"super-conference\\", which was renamed the East Penn Conference.http://www.mcall.com/sports/mc-lvc- mvc-league-merger-20130815,0,2372001.story Lehighton left the Mountain Valley Conference in most sports and now participate in the Schuylkill League.

The church is located on the southwest corner of Meyer Boulevard and Wornall Road in Kansas City, Missouri. The Reverend John Spicer is rector. The Reverend Anne Hutcherson is associate rector. The Reverend Jeff Stevenson is the assistant rector. The deacon is the Ven. Bruce Bower. St. Andrew's holds worship services with Eucharist three times every week. The church has approximately 1,500 members and welcomes all people to worship. The rector, associate rector, assistant rector, and deacon are the spiritual leaders at St. Andrew's. An 18-member vestry, led by a senior warden and junior warden, serves as lay leaders. Melissa Rock is the current Senior Warden and Lora Kokjer serves as Junior Warden. The vestry and clergy share mutual responsibility for establishing and fulfilling the church's mission and vision. Six vestry members are elected for a three-year term each year in January at an all-parish meeting. Nominations take place in the summer prior to the January election. Rectors Jun 2012‚Äìpresent: the Reverend John Spicer Fr. Spicer has been rector of St. Andrew's since June 2012. He was previously the church's associate rector (2005‚Äì2011) and was called by the vestry and diocesan bishop, the Rt. Rev. Barry R. Howe, be priest-in-charge effective July 1, 2011, upon the retirement of the Reverend Frederick \\"Fred\\" Mann. On May 15, 2012, the vestry unanimously voted to call Fr. Spicer as rector. Subsequently, the new diocesan bishop, the Rt. Rev. Martin S. Field, approved the call, and Fr. Spicer accepted the call during the parish's worship on June 3, 2012. Jan 2004-Jun 2011: the Reverend Frederick \\"Fred\\" Mann History The current church building is the fourth parish house for St. Andrew's. 1913 - St. Andrew's Mission held its first church service on January 19 in the home of Rev. Charles Weed, Rector, and Mrs. Weed. Twenty-three people attended the first service. Having outgrown the Weed's home, services moved a few weeks later to 59th and Brookside Boulevard, where they were held in a back room of Fred Wolferman's grocery that adjoined his stables. Clopping horses' hooves and whinnies mixed with the Epistle and Holy Gospel. Later in 1913, the congregation built a small, white one-room chapel that seat 100 people. The communion rail was long enough for just seven people. Members rejoiced if it was filled three times at a service. 1916 - St. Andrew's acquired its current property at Wornall Road and Meyer Boulevard for $11,000 ($177,000 in 2010). Communicants besieged the Rector for buying property so far into the country to where nothing was in sight but a man and a plow. But, he had foreseen southward growth of the city. 1922 - With World War I over, St. Andrew's could finally break ground on the first church built at Wornall and Meyer. The \\"little brown church\\" was built in an English Gothic style on the south end of the property. Some called it \\"The Good Shepherd Chapel,\\" in hommage to the Church of the Good Shepherd, as St. Andrew's was known between 1913 and 1916. The cost for the new church was $20,000 ($270,000 in 2010). The first service was Easter Day 1923. 1931 - Bishop Spencer laid the cornerstone of the second church to be built at Wornall and Meyer that would seat 384. The brown stucco church was originally intended to last only 10‚Äì12 years, but ended up being the home of St. Andrew's for 20 years. Our altar and pulpit were first housed in this building. The first service took place on a rainy day in fall 1931 - the roof leaked. 1945 - St. Andrew's formed a building committee to begin working on the church that stands today. 1946 - The first fund drive for the new building raised $158,400 ($1,050,000 in 2010), four years before ground breaking. 1950 - After more successful fund drives, the vestry voted to begin construction of the current church building. The estimated cost was $525,000 ($3,100,000 in 2010). An accelerated fund drive was launched to raise the additional money needed. Groundbreaking was on June 18. The Good Shepherd Chapel was torn down to make way for the new church. 1952 - The church we know today held its first service on March 30. What is now the Jewell Room was a terrace and the main entrance to the new church. 1973 - St. Andrew's began a new fund drive for an expansion that was considered vital to the long-term future of St. Andrew's. Parishioners raised $740,000 ($2,100,000 in 2010) to build the Jewell Room, bride's room, parish offices, library, Undercroft, Auxiliary Room and Wornall Road entrance. Construction was completed in 1974. With this new funding, St. Andrew's was also able to purchase six homes that stood immediately south of the church. They were rented for many years before being moved by Habitat for Humanity in the early 1990s to make room for the parking lot. 1990 - St. Andrew's purchased the former YMCA building across the street from the church to use as a youth center and renamed it \\"HJ's\\" in honor of the son of the parishioner who donated the funds for the building. 2006 - Allison Fikejs is hired as soprano soloist. 2010 - St. Andrew's parishioners pledged $1,600,000 to Rebuild, Restore and Renew the nearly 60-year-old church building. 2013 - St. Andrew's will celebrate its 100th anniversary on January 13. 2014 - Dr. Thomas R. Vozzella is hired as Director of Music, Organist and Choir Director.

The suburb of Linwood was named after Brittan's farm and homestead. Brittan's daughter Mary married William Rolleston, and they lived at Linwood House following Joseph Brittan's death. During that time, Rolleston was the 4th (and last) Superintendent of the Canterbury Province, and Linwood House served for many important political and public functions. The property went through many changes in ownership. Land was successively subdivided; at its peak, of land belonged to Linwood House, of which only remain. For some years, Linwood House was used as a private day and boarding school for girls. The house declined during the mid 20ths century, was used for flats for several decades, and was in 1985 described by an historian as the \\"city's worst example of a house which should be preserved being left to decay\\". The house's fortunes improved when it was purchased in 1988 by people sympathetic to heritage. Gradually being restored, Linwood House suffered significant damage in the 2010 Canterbury earthquake and partially collapsed in the 2011 Christchurch earthquake. Civil Defence ordered the building's demolition, which was carried out in the second half of 2011. Architecturally, Linwood House was a rare example of a late Georgian / Regency style house in Canterbury. It had historical importance as one of the oldest surviving houses in Christchurch. The building's association with Joseph Brittan and especially William Rolleston made it socially important. Geography Linwood House was located at 30 Linwood Avenue in Linwood, Christchurch. Originally located on of rural section (RS) 300, and after the adjacent RS 301 was added, the total size of the land holding was . After numerous subdivisions, the size of the section was . The Christchurch suburb of Linwood was named after Brittan's farm and homestead. History and ownership =Joseph Brittan (1857‚Äì1867)= Portrait of Joseph Brittan Brothers Guise and Joseph Brittan, and their friend Charles Fooks had in common that they all married one of the four Chandler daughters. The Brittans were surgeons, whilst Fooks was an architect. Guise Brittan held a role of responsibility for the Canterbury Association, and he came to Christchurch on in December 1850, and his wife and four children travelled with him. Fooks went with them, but left his family behind in England. Joseph Brittan's wife Elizabeth Mary had died in 1849. He remarried in a manner that was illegal at the time, socially unacceptable and causing a scandal‚Äîhe took Elizabeth's sister Sophia, the fourth Chandler daughter, as his second wife. The newly- weds reacted to the scandal in a way that was not unusual at the time; they left their problems behind and emigrated, which they did a month after the ceremony. They sailed for Christchurch on the William Hyde, which left Deal, Kent on 21 October 1851 and arrived in Lyttelton on 5 February 1852. Mrs Fooks and her two daughters came to New Zealand with Joseph Brittan's family. By mid-1852, Joseph Brittan purchased RS 300, comprising rural land about east of Cathedral Square. In 1855/56, Guise Brittan had Englefield Lodge built on land alongside the Avon River just outside the initial town area (these days the area to the east of Fitzgerald Avenue). Joseph Brittan chose land a short distance downstream along the Avon River and had his homestead, Linwood House, built in 1857. Fooks was the architect for Linwood House, and, based on an assessment by art historian Dr Ian Lochhead, it is likely that he also designed Englefield Lodge. Joseph Brittan called his property and farm Linwood after his home in Linwood, Hampshire. Joseph Brittan had varied interests and immediately upon arrival in Christchurch, joined others in various activities. He played cricket in Hagley Park within a fortnight of reaching Christchurch, and later helped improve the grounds and raised money for fencing the area. He was into horse racing, later bred horses, and Canterbury's first steeplechase was held on his Linwood farm. The Brittans were into music and his wife Sophia Brittan brought her piano from England. Joseph Brittan had a portable harmonium and as in the early years, Lyttelton was culturally more important than Christchurch, he joined a musical group in the port town. For performances, he walked over the Bridle Path with the instrument strapped to his back. Musical evenings were also held at the Brittan home. About halfway between Englefield and Linwood was Holy Trinity Avonside, at the time a cob church. Guise Brittan was its churchwarden. The whole Brittan family had a close connection to the church, with Joseph Brittan helping to raise money for its construction, and his daughter Mary singing in the church choir. They faithfully attended church on Sundays. Tragedy struck on 1 January 1862, when his son Arthur drowned in the Avon River while learning to swim. He got entangled in watercress, which the Brittans themselves had introduced to the Avon, and his body was only found after a good half-hour. Arthur had left school by then and was helping his father on the farm. Joseph Brittan was heartbroken and signs were that he had a period of depression. Soon after the drowning, he advertised for both a dairyman and a farmworker. He even put Linwood House up for sale, but no property transaction was recorded. William Rolleston in 1870 William Rolleston, at the time Provincial Secretary, proposed to Mary Brittan in early 1865. He was 34 at the time, and she was 19. Both Joseph and Sophia Brittan were opposed to a marriage, which is surprising, given that Rolleston was intelligent, well educated, successful, and if anything, of higher social standing. They thought him too old for their daughter, her too young to marry. Maybe Sophia Brittan did not want to lose her daughter, who was in effect running the household and entertained guests, as she was often too ill to look after these tasks herself. But Rolleston was offered and accepted the role of Under Secretary for Native Affairs, which required moving to Wellington. Hence, the wedding went ahead on 24 May 1865 at Avonside Trinity Church, before the newly-weds moved to the capital. Joseph Brittan's health declined during 1867. Of distress for the family were the financial affairs, with various debts that only Joseph knew about. Rolleston tried to give financial advice to both Sophia and her son Frank, but he was ignored. Joseph Brittan died on 27 October 1867 at Linwood House. Brittan Street in Linwood, named after Joseph Brittan, first appeared in street directories in 1892. Today, the Linwood House section fronts onto both Linwood Avenue and Brittan Street. =Sophia Brittan (1867‚Äì1877)= Sophia Brittan in 1872 Sophia Brittan inherited the house and land from her late husband. Initially, it was left to her son Frank to run the farm. In 1868, there were rumours that William Sefton Moorhouse would resign as Canterbury Superintendent, and Rolleston was encouraged to make himself available. He returned to Christchurch, whilst his wife Mary and their two children remained in Wellington. Rolleston was elected unopposed on 22 May 1868. And on 8 June, he was elected to Parliament in the in the electorate. Late in 1868, the Rollestons moved back to Christchurch to live at Linwood House. This was a delicate affair, as this made conditions cramped (Sophia, her sons Joe and Frank, the Rollestons with their two children, plus servants made for cramped living in the eight rooms), and there has always been tension between William Rolleston and Frank Brittan. Mary Rolleston arranged for her oldest brother Joe, who had some disability, to live with his aunt, Mrs Fooks. Charles Fooks was imprisoned at that time, and it was good for Mrs Fooks to have a male live with her. The Rollestons paid rent, which helped Sophia Brittan service the mortgage. With Rolleston Superintendent until the abolition of Provincial Government at the end of 1876, Linwood House hosted many important social and political functions. Linwood farm was used for sporting events. In July 1876, the Christchurch rugby team met their South Canterbury counterparts from Timaru (Christchurch won the game), and in May 1877, the Canterbury Hunt Club met for a steeplechase in the sand hills of the farm. =Frank Brittan (1877‚Äì1889)= Sophia Brittan died in August 1877. Whilst the Rollestons had carried the Brittan family financially over the last decade, their contributions went practically unrecognised. Mary Rolleston inherited ¬£400 and the piano, her oldest brother received an annual annuity of ¬£20, and Frank Brittan was given the farm, the house and all its contents. William Rolleston was \\"shocked, hurt and astonished\\" by the unfairness of this distribution. Contact between the Rollestons and Frank Brittan all but ceased. Much later in life, Mary Rolleston would see her brother briefly once a year on New Year's Day at his home, and that was all the contact that they had. In May 1878, Frank Brittan sold of land subdivided into 231 sections for a total of ¬£18,489. He made a handsome profit, as much of the land was purchased three years earlier for ¬£49 per hectare, and he sold the land for some ¬£318 per acre (¬£127 per ha). Linwood Estate was located east of Stanmore Road, and comprised the extensions of Cashel, Hereford, and Worcester Streets. At the same auction, Brittan sold all his stock and farming implements, as he had bought Kelsie Estate in Selwyn County. Further subdivision followed in 1886. =Edward Hiorns (1889‚Äì1912)= Edward Hiorns Edward Hiorns (1838 ‚Äì 7 July 1912) emigrated in 1862 from England. Originally a plumber and tinsmith, he became a hotelier. From 1881 to 1883, he was a member of Christchurch City Council, and later stood for office on the Linwood Borough Council. Hiorns was Masonic Grand Master of New Zealand, and attended the 1897 Queen Victoria Golden Jubilee in England in that capacity. Frank Brittan sold Linwood House to Hiorns in 1889, who commissioned architect John Whitelaw to design an extension. This resulted in a drawing room, a billiard room and a study to be added to the house. In 1898, Hiorns leased Linwood House to Sir John Denniston for five years. Hiorns had retired from business and spent some of his time in Sydney. Denniston, the oldest son of Thomas Denniston and married to the daughter of John Bathgate, was a judge at the Supreme Court in Christchurch. After Denniston had moved out, Hiorns carried out further subdivisions in 1903 and 1905. For a time, Linwood House was reputedly leased to Alexander Boyle. He was one of the founders of Pyne and Co, which later became Pyne Gould Guinness, of which Boyle was chairman of the board. In September 1903, Helen McKee and her mother relocated their boarding and day school for girls, Avonside College, from Inveresk (the former dwelling of John Anderson) to Linwood House. Helen McKee was a daughter of the highly esteemed Rev. David McKee, who came to New Zealand in January 1880 as the first vicar of North Belt Church (later known as Knox Church). The Reverend died after only ten months in New Zealand, though. The congregation provided generously for his widow and her children, and at some point, his wife started a school. Helen McKee became a pupil teacher at Riccarton School in 1887. Avonside College remained at Linwood House until 1911, when it relocated to Rhodes Street and was renamed Meriden College. The Hiorns returned from Sydney in 1911 and lived at Linwood House. Amelia Hiorns died in December of that year, and Edward Hiorns died on 7 July 1912. =Various owners (1913‚Äì1988)= Bracing after the 4 September 2010 earthquake; in the background the 1889 wing designed by John Whitelaw Chimney after the 22 February 2011 earthquake The front door steps are all that remains of Linwood house after demolition Collapsed wall after the 22 February 2011 earthquake despite bracing Although the Hiorns had descendants, the estate was managed by the Public Trustee, who put Linwood House up for sale as four sections, with one of those holding the house itself. Three of the sections were purchased by Thomas Marker on 4 June 1913 in an auction, including the one containing the building. Marker paid ¬£200 each for the building sections, and ¬£1,250 for the section containing the house. The furniture of Linwood House was sold in a separate auction. The house was rented to lawyer Francis Ion Cowlishaw, son of prominent provincial councillor William Patten Cowlishaw (1839‚Äì1903). Cowlishaw senior had lived nearby in a house named 'Chaddesden', and Cowlishaw Street and Chaddesden Lane are named after the family. Francis Cowlishaw purchased Linwood House in 1916 for ¬£1,592. In 1920, a dance of Christchurch's social elite was held at Linwood House. Cowlishaw sold the house later that year to Mrs Ethel Pyne, the widow of Frederick Pyne (d. 1915), who was a business partner of former Linwood House lessee Alexander Boyle. Immediately after the purchase, Ethel Pyne engaged Sidney and Alfred Luttrell to design a ¬£700 extension to the house, and it is assumed that this was the addition of a second storey to an earlier service wing. Further subdivisions were carried out in 1927 and 1932, after which Linwood House was sold to Florence Simpson in the latter year. Simpson in turn undertook subdivision in 1935, before selling the remainder to Gordon Branthwaite, a solicitor, in 1945. Records reveal that by 1948, there were six residents living at Linwood House, indicating that the house had been set up for flatting in the meantime. Branthwaite subdivided the land behind Linwood House in 1958. He died in 1972, and his widow sold the property in the same year to Advance Buildings (Nelson) Ltd; her daughter was a partner in that company. Local historian John Wilson, who in 1984 wrote the book Lost Christchurch, that year called Linwood House the \\"city's worst example of a house which should be preserved being left to decay\\". =Paddy and Jacky Snowdon (1988‚Äìpresent)= Paddy and Jacky Snowdon bought the property in 1988. They increased occupancy to seven flats, carried out alterations and achieved compliance with fire regulations. The Snowdons undertook renovations that were long overdue, and that were sympathetic to the historic significance of the building. By 2002, a conservation report had been completed. Linwood House suffered significant damage in the 2010 Canterbury earthquake. The upstairs and the roof got braced after the event, and this was beneficial when the 2011 Christchurch earthquake struck, but internal walls and fireplaces just \\"crumbled\\". Civil Defence ordered the building's demolition in March 2011. It was demolished during the second half of 2011. A symposium was held on 7 December 2012 in Wellington on New Zealand architecture in the 1850s. One of the papers given was \\"Gentlemen's residences in 1850s Christchurch: An examination of the homes of William Rolleston and John Cracroft Wilson\\". Heritage listing Linwood House was registered as a heritage building by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust (now Heritage New Zealand) on 17 August 1982 with registration number 3119 classified as D.See talk page for an explanation of the registration date, as a 2005 date is shown in later documents With the change of the classification system, the building later became a Category II listing. Architectural and building history Architect's sketch of Linwood House The 1920s Luttrell Brothers extension and the washhouse, with bracing after the 2010 Canterbury earthquake The 1857 house is in Regency architectural style. It was oriented so that its long side, facing north-east, was roughly parallel to Linwood Avenue. Rectangular in floor plan, the Linwood Avenue frontage had five bays, with the central bay pedimented, which gave the house a symmetrical look. An 1871 photo by Alfred Charles Barker, held by the Canterbury Museum, shows a verandah on the north- west side of the building only. This verandah was later extended to cover the front as well, and it mirrors the pedimented central bay. A hipped roof was hidden behind a balustrade. The house was constructed in double brick, and it is this unreinforced masonry construction that was unable to cope with the earthquake forces. Upstairs, windows were round-headed. Downstairs, many of the openings were French doors. Heritage New Zealand (NZHPT) was for a time uncertain who the architect was. In about 1995, the last owner's daughter, when undertaking research for a school assignment, came across the architect's sketch of Linwood House in the Anglican Church archives, and this proved that Charles Fooks, the brother-in-law of Joseph Brittan, designed the house. A significant extension was designed in 1889 by John Whitelaw. The south-west wing, 'behind' the original house, used the different architectural style of a Victorian villa for the two-storey addition. The NZHPT assumes that at the same time, a single storey extension was built onto the south-east side. The last significant extension was added in 1920, which was designed by the Luttrell Brothers. The south-east wing was much more in keeping with the original design. It is possible that the architects designed a second storey for the service wing that had been built in 1889. This extension connected the original house with the original washhouse. In 1972, a kitchen and small toilet were added as a lean-to. These were removed again in ca 1990.

Early life John Hill Belcher Mason was born in Orange, New Jersey the son of Daniel Gregory and Susan W. (n√©e Belcher) Mason. He was the son of a publisher and a grandson of Dr. Lowell Mason, a well‚Äìknown educator and composer of Christian music. Mason was a cousin to composer and music critic Daniel Gregory Mason and could trace his American lineage back to Robert Mason, an Englishman who settled in Salem, Massachusetts, in 1630. His mother was a direct descendant of Jonathan Belcher, a colonial governor of the Province of Massachusetts Bay.Jonathan Belcher, Colonial governor By Michael C. Batinski 1996Derby, George; and White, James Terry. \\"John B. Mason\\", The National Cyclopaedia of American Biography, 1916, pg. 51. John Mason was educated in private schools in America and overseas at the Frankfort Gymnasium, before enrolling at Columbia University in 1876. Career As Kerchival West in Shenandoah John Mason (often referred to by the press as Jack Mason) made his professional stage debut two years later at the Walnut Street Theatre in Philadelphia. During his first season he appeared opposite such luminaries of the day as Lawrence Barrett, Mary Anderson, Lotta Crabtree, James K. Emmet, J. C. Williamson, Mme. Janauschek, Fanny Davenport and Frank C. Bangs. The following year he began a 12-year association with the Boston Museum working with William Warren, Dion Boucicault, Lester Wallack and other well-known actors of that time. He later appeared in every original Gilbert and Sullivan opera production in America and created the leading roles in the plays Hands Across the Sea, The English Rose and as Kerchival West in Bronson Howard's Civil War play, Shenandoah. After the death of his mother in 1890, Mason went to London where he found success at the St. James Theatre playing Simeon Strong in C. Haddon Chambers' popular play The Idler. Later back in America, Mason starred for three seasons in an adaptation of the comic opera L'Ami Fritz, with Marion Manola. After a brief foray into vaudeville, Mason returned to the legitimate theater to revive his role in The Idler, and later at the Garrick Theatre playing Col. Moberly in Augustus Thomas' Alabama. Mason returned to the United States the next year to form the Mason-Manola Company and tour with a revival of L'Ami Fritz. In 1898 he creating the character Horatio Drake in Hall Caine's successful play The Christian, at the Knickerbocker Theatre in New York. In his later years Mason performed in companies headed by Elsie De Wolfe, Daniel Frohman Minnie Maddern Fiske among others. His greatest role came in 1907, playing Jack Brookfield in Augustus Thomas's play The Witching Hour, which had a run of 970 performances. Augustus Thomas once compared Mason to the great French actor Lucien Guitry: \\"He has all that Guitry has and in addition he has the ability to wear a dress suit and to conduct himself in a salon with the grace of a nobleman.\\" Marriage Marion Manola circa 1894 John Mason married actress Marion Manola, on May 1, 1891, in London, England, ending months of speculation in the press.

He served in the Afghan War from 1878 to 1880, and was mentioned in dispatches. He was later a police-officer in Sierra Leone, but ended his career in disgrace when he was imprisoned for causing the death of a native by flogging. He played football four times for Scotland in the representative matches played between 1870 and 1872, scoring the opening goal in the first match. He also played first class cricket for M.C.C. in 1872 and 1873. Family and education Crawford was born in Elizabeth Castle, Jersey where his father, Captain Robert Fitzgerald Crawford was serving with the Royal Regiment of Artillery. He was raised in Edinburgh, before attending Harrow School between 1866 and 1871. At Harrow, he was a member of the school football XI between 1869 and 1871 and represented the school at cricket between 1868 and 1871. The family name was changed to \\"Copland-Crawford\\" in September 1872. Sporting career =Football= While still at Harrow School, Crawford was selected to represent Scotland at football in the first \\"pseudo-international\\" organised by C. W. Alcock and Arthur Kinnaird in March 1870. Late in the second half, Alcock instructed England's goalkeeper to leave his goal and move upfield in support of the forwards; Crawford took advantage of this and, shooting from distance into an empty goal, gave Scotland the lead with 15 minutes remaining. (The Sporting Gazette of Saturday 12 March 1870 described the goal as \\"a rather lucky kick\\" and \\"almost a fluke\\".) England equalised in the 90th minute with a goal from Alfred Baker and the match ended in a 1‚Äì1 draw. Crawford retained his place for the next match between the two sides played on 19 November 1870, which ended in a 1‚Äì0 victory for the English and again \\"played well\\". Having missed out on the third match, Crawford, now with the Harrow Chequers club, played in the final two matches on 18 November 1871 and 24 February 1872, which both ended with victories for England. In each of these matches he was joined by his brother, Fitzgerald. According to a report on the November 1871 match, Crawford was \\"truly unwearied from beginning to end\\" although \\"owing to the long journey from Edinburgh, . . . (he) hardly showed his best form.\\" In the report on the final match, he and his brother were praised for their \\"untiring forward play throughout\\". As a member of the Harrow Chequers club, he played (as team captain) alongside his brother against the Wanderers in the opening match of the 1871‚Äì72 season, which ended scoreless. In the match report in the Morning Post on Monday, 16 October 1871, the Crawford brothers were commended for being \\"conspicuous for excellent play\\". Both brothers were later to become members of the Wanderers club; Robert's last match for the Wanderers was the FA Cup semi-final against Queens Park on 4 March 1872 which ended in a 0‚Äì0 draw. =Cricket= Crawford played cricket for Harrow School between 1868 and 1871. His best performances for the school came against a side from Lords and Commons on 10 June 1871 when he scored 72 runs and took four wickets with his underarm bowling (plus one catch) in a drawn match, and against Harrow Town on 4 July 1871 when he claimed six wickets in Harrow Town's second innings. He made two first class appearances for M.C.C. in 1872 and 1873 as well as an appearance for the North of England against the South. He made several other appearances for the M.C.C. as well as playing for the Old Harrovians, the Army and I Zingari, for whom he scored his only recorded century in a match against Household Brigade on 18 July 1872; he scored 106 playing with a young George Harris, who scored 117. Harris was later to captain Kent and England. Military career Copland-Crawford joined the 2nd Middlesex or Edmonton Royal Rifle Regiment of Militia and in September 1873 was appointed as a sub- lieutenant. The following January, he joined the 60th Rifles with the rank of sub-lieutenant and resigned his commission with the 2nd Middlesex Militia. In January 1876, he was promoted to the full rank of lieutenant with the 60th Foot. He served in the Afghan War from 1878 to 1880, and was mentioned in dispatches for his involvement in the Battle of Ahmed Khel in April 1880. He also took part in the march to Kandahar under the overall command of Sir Frederick Roberts. He resigned his commission on 6 August 1884. Sierra Leone In mid-September 1888, he took up a six-month posting with the Sierra Leone Frontier Police, but ended his career in disgrace after he was sentenced to 12 months' imprisonment with hard labour for causing a native servant to be flogged to death. Copland-Crawford was posted to the Sulymah district in the south-east of Sierra Leone, in an area described as \\"a narrow strip of coast in the south east of the colony, bounded by the territories of a number of independent native chieftains, who have never yet been considered subject to the British Crown\\". Shortly after his appointment, he made a visit to one of the local chiefs, Makaia (or Mackiah), at the town of Lago with instructions from the Governor of Sierra Leone, Sir James Hay to \\"enter into negotiations with a view to a peaceable settlement of disorders that had taken place on the frontier\\". Despite being hospitably received by Makaia, Copland-Crawford reported back \\"As your Excellency is well aware, the only way to renew trade, not 5 per cent, but 100 per cent, which means good for the Revenue as well as good for the merchants and traders, is to smash once and for all Mackiah, on one side, and Gumbo Saido . . . on the other\\". His report was not favourably received by Hay who wrote back \\"While I am pleased to note that your journey has not been attended by any untoward accident, I cannot but remark that it is one which should not have been undertaken without specific instructions from the officer administering the Government, the more so as, at present, the relations between Mackiah and this Government are such that the future policy in dealing with him is one which requires much consideration\\". Despite this warning, Copland-Crawford then embarked on a further visit, this time to another chief, Fahwoondoo. When Fahwoondoo declined a request to attend a meeting with Copland-Crawford, Copland-Crawford ordered his arrest. In the resulting fight, ten of Fahwoondoo's men were killed and three constables injured; Fahwoondoo was taken to Sulymah where he was imprisoned. Governor Hay again expressed his displeasure: \\"Apart from the fact that your action may create complications, it is at all times, and more so at present, unadvisable to arouse the hostility of the people with whom the police come in constant contact, as it may have a tendency to render their services as messengers, as heretofore, of little or no use to us when once distrust has been created. I remark, that you say in your Report that you issued a warrant to make this arrest; this, I need hardly inform you, was invalid, and should not again be resorted to\\". On 12 December, Copland-Crawford captured the town of Jehoma, killing 131 of Makaia's \\"warboys\\" with one policeman receiving serious injuries; this was again without authority from Governor Hay. Copland-Crawford was yet again rebuked by Hay: \\"I have once more to point out that in so doing you have exceeded your instructions; you have no authority from this Government to assume the offensive by attacking towns\\". Copland-Crawford's actions eventually came to the attention of Parliament in London and, on 2 June 1890, were the subject of a heated debate with James Picton M.P. and others criticising his actions and the failure of Governor Hay to restrain him, while Baron Henry de Worms, Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies endeavoured to defend Hay in particular. In April 1889, Copland-Crawford was arrested on a charge of causing a native servant to be flogged to death, his object being to extort a confession of crime. In July, he was tried at Freetown and found guilty; he was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment with hard labour. By this time, his health was not good and the authorities decided to send him back to England. He was shipped back from Freeport to Liverpool on board the S.S. Lagos in August. On his arrival at Liverpool he was examined by two doctors who reported that Copland-Crawford was suffering from the following conditions: > Absence of reflex action at left knee, slightly present in right knee; > impaired sensibility of left foot and leg up to knee; inability to clench > the hands tightly; unsteadiness of gait; ≈ìdema of both ankles and feet; > enlargement of abdomen (evidently from fluid) with increased size of liver > and spleen; excited action of heart; marked mental excitement; slight > hesitancy in speech. As a result it was decided that Copland-Crawford was unfit to be imprisoned and the remainder of his sentence was remitted. He died on 23 May 1894.

In any case, it would be one of the youngest South American impact craters known. It is partially filled by turfaceous sediment with maximum depth of , which provides a precious record of ancient environment. The upper , in particular, have provided a detailed climate and ecological record of the last 130,000 years; the complete record may stretch back to 2.5 million years ago. Data from seismic and other surveys indicate that below the sediment there are about of fragmented rock deposits, and another 50 m of shocked or deformed basement rock. Sediment analysis indicate that until 18,000 years ago a lake occupied the central part of the crater, which has become a swamp.Paulo Gomes Varella (2009) A CRATERA DE COL√îNIA (in Portuguese). The crater is drained towards the east by the Vargem Grande creek into the adjacent Billings Reservoir. The tentative identification as an impact crater is based mainly on geomorphology, faulting pattern, and on the exclusion of other possible formation mechanisms. In particular, there are no carbonate rocks that could produce to karstic sinkholes. As of 2011 there were no reports of definite evidence, such as shatter cones or shocked quartz. To find such evidence one would have to drill through the sediment fill.  Urbanization and legal status  The Col√¥nia crater is located in the suburban Parelheiros region of the sprawling S√£o Paulo metropolitan area, about from the city's center. Besides the central swamp, the crater encloses remains of the native Atlantic rainforest. Starting in 1989, the northern part of the crater has been gradually occupied by irregular housing that comprise the Vargem Grande neighborhood, now home to 35,000 to 40,000 people. To prevent further degradation, the crater has been declared a protected natural landmark, registered in 1995 by the CONDEPHAAT. Its southern part was incorporated to the Capivari Monos Municipal Parkland in 1996.  See also  * List of impact craters on Earth  References   Further reading  * C. Riccomini, F.A.P.S. Neves, B.

More limited than the United States doctrine of fair use, fair dealing originates in Sections 29 and 30 of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988, and requires the infringer to show not only that their copying falls into one of the three fair dealing categories, but also that it is \\"fair\\" and, in some cases, that it contains sufficient acknowledgement for the original author. Factors when deciding the \\"fairness\\" of the copying can include the quantity of the work taken, whether it was previously published, the motives of the infringer and what the consequences of the infringement on the original author's returns for the copyrighted work will be. Research and study does not apply to commercial research, and does not include infringements of broadcasts, sound recordings or film; it also has only a limited application to software. These exclusions have been criticised as failing \\"to reflect the increasing importance of non- textual media for both study and research\\". Research cannot be private, and in a non-academic setting must also not have a future potential commercial purpose. This exception also excludes, under Section 29(3)(b) of the 1988 Act, copying which will result in \\"copies of substantially the same material being provided to more than one person at substantially the same time and for substantially the same purpose\\". Criticism or review is interpreted liberally, and may include criticism or review of a work's social or moral implications or its impact, but this exception is only available when the work in question has been previously made available to the public. Reporting of current events is only an exception where the event is \\"current\\", and may exclude trivial or ephemeral news; such news can, however, become an \\"event\\" through media coverage. Definition Fair dealing is an exception to United Kingdom copyright law which allows for the use of copyrighted works without licensing in certain circumstances. It is governed by Sections 29 and 30 of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988, which provide three types of situation in which fair dealing is a valid defence: where the use is for the purposes of research or private study, where it is to allow for criticism or review, and where it is for the purpose of reporting current events. This can be contrasted with the United States doctrine of fair use, which provides a general defence rather than rigid and specific categories of acceptable behaviour.Bently & Sherman (2009) p.202 Under United Kingdom law, an infringer relying on fair dealing as a defence must show that their actions fall into a specific category of acceptable use, as opposed to the \\"illustrative open list of purposes\\" in US law.Aplin & Davis (2009) p.147 The fair dealing exceptions had previously been formalised in case law as \\"fair use\\" forms, but this was eliminated by the Copyright Act 1911.Cornish, Llewelyn & Aplin (2010) p.501 Fair dealing Fair dealing is a defence after the fact. If sued for copyright infringement, one can rely on fair dealing as a defence in court, but the defence \\"only comes into play once a claimant has established that copyright has been infringed. Where this occurs, the onus of proof [then] falls on the defendant to prove that one of the exceptions applies\\".Bently & Sherman (2009) p.200 This is done first by proving that the infringement falls within one of the three categories, which are liberally interpreted by the courts. The courts will not, however, give any consideration to what the infringer thought his work was for, or rely on a subjective test in any way; as in Hyde Park Residence v Yelland,[2000] EMLR 363 it is not seen as necessary \\"for the court to put itself in the shoes of the infringer of the copyright\\". Instead, a more objective test is used, to avoid providing \\"any encouragement to the notion that all that is required is for the user to have a sincere belief, however misguided, that he or she is criticising a work or reporting current affairs\\".Bently & Sherman (2009) p.203 If the copyright infringer can show that their use falls within one of the three categories, they must then show that the dealing was \\"fair\\". This takes into account a number of things, and due to the freedom of speech provisions under the Human Rights Act 1998 is deliberately intended not to be based on rigid and inflexible tests. Instead, as in Ashdown v Telegraph Group Ltd,[2002] Ch 149 the courts \\"bear in mind that considerations of public interest are paramount\\". Because of this, there are many different things which enhance or detract from the \\"fair\\" nature of the dealing. If the copyrighted work had not been \\"made available to the public\\" at the time, this will count against the use being fair, and makes the defence on the grounds of criticism and review \\"unavailable\\". The courts will give different weight to different kinds of documents; a series of private letters which have not been published will detract more from the fairness of the infringement than unpublished official reports which discuss matters of public interest. How the work was obtained and for what purpose is also a factor. If the work was obtained illegally or unethically, the dealing is less likely to be \\"fair\\" than if it was legitimately acquired. Similarly, if the motives of the dealing are negative, the fairness will be impugned. As in Hyde Park, the court must \\"judge the fairness by the objective standard of whether a fair minded and honest person would have dealt with the copyright work in the manner\\" in question. Consequences are also a factor; if, as in Hubbard v Vosper,[1972] 2 QB 84 the parties to the case are competitors and infringing on the work acts as an alternative to purchasing the original, this will limit the fairness of the dealing. Occasionally the courts will also consider whether the purpose of the infringement could have been achieved in a less intrusive way, as in Hyde Park.Bently & Sherman (2009) p.205 The quantity of the work taken is also taken into account. If the infringer uses the majority of a copyrighted work, or all of it, they reduce the expected returns of the copyright owner and compromise \\"the role that copyright plays in encouraging creativity\\". As such, the fair dealing defence usually only applies when part of a work has been taken, although some judicial comments, such as those of Megaw LJ in Hubbard, state that there are a few cases in which the work is so short that reproducing it in its entirety may be acceptable. The use made of the work is another factor; if the infringer takes a copyrighted work and reorganises or reinterprets it, the courts are more likely to find that the dealing qualifies as fair than if the work is simply reproduced without modification or analysis.Bently & Sherman (2009) p.204 In some situations, the fair dealing defence must be accompanied by \\"sufficient acknowledgement\\", where the author and the original work must be identified either by the title or some other description.Bently & Sherman (2009) p.206 =Research and study= Under Section 29(1) of the 1988 Act, fair dealing is a valid defence when dealing with copyright infringement for the purpose of non-commercial research or private study. This applies to \\"literary, dramatical, musical and artistic works, as well as with the typographical formats of published works\\"; it does not apply to infringement of broadcasts, sound recordings or film. The rationale for this exception to copyright law is that research and study is necessary to create new works and inspire innovation, while the non-commercial nature of the research does not interfere with the rewards that copyright provides to the original copyright holder.Bently & Sherman (2009) p.207 The limited nature of the exception is criticised by Burrell and Coleman, who argue that it \\"fails to reflect the increasing importance of non-textual media for both study and research\\".Burrell & Coleman (2005) p.116 The exception also has only a limited application to things such as software. For this defence to apply, the infringer must show that the dealing is for non-commercial research or private study, private study being defined by Section 178 as excluding any study directly or indirectly for commercial purpose; it therefore covers most academic purposes, but not things such as the use of a database in market- testing of new drugs. Research, when not academic, is covered by The Controller of Her Majesty's Stationery Office, Ordnance Survey v Green Amps Ltd,[2007] EWHC 2755 (Ch) which sets the test as whether or not it is thought that the research would be used for a commercial purpose in the future. Although the precise distinction between research and private study has not historically been important, modern case law states that there is a difference. Unlike study, research cannot be private, as the exception to copyright law is justified because research provides a benefit to society as a whole. As with all fair dealing exceptions, copying for research or study purposes must also be \\"fair\\", taking into account the various factors mentioned above. There are special cases, particularly when dealing with copying by third parties. If the person doing the copying is not the one doing the research, different rules apply; a publisher cannot use it to justify printing parts of other publishers works, as in Sillitoe v McGraw Hill, but in order to uphold the exception's justification, the courts do recognise that it can cover a research assistant making photocopies on behalf of a student or researcher. However, as a limitation, Section 29(3)(b) provides that the copying cannot be fair dealing if the person doing it knows that it will result in \\"copies of substantially the same material being provided to more than one person at substantially the same time and for substantially the same purpose\\". In other words, an academic cannot print off multiple copies of a work for students and then rely on the fair dealings exception.Bently & Sherman (2009) p.209 =Criticism or review= Section 30(1) of the 1988 Act provides that the fair dealing exception is valid if the material is being copied for criticism or review. For it to apply, the infringer must be able to show that the dealing was for criticism or review, that the infringed work was previously made available to the public, that the dealing was fair, and that the dealing was accompanied by an acknowledgement. The first step requires the defendant to show that the copying was done to criticise or review the work in question, the performance of the work, or, as in Beloff v Pressdram,[1973] 1 All ER 241 another work. The courts will interpret \\"criticism or review\\" liberally, as in Newspaper Licensing Agency v Marks & Spencers plc, and as such the criticism or review can include the thought or philosophy of the work, as in Time Warner v Channel 4,[1994] EMLR 1 or the social and moral implications of the work, as in Pro Sieben Media v Carlton Television.[1999] FSR 610Bently & Sherman (2009) p.210 The exception is only applicable where the work has previously been made available to the public \\"by any means\\" including the issuing of copies, lending copies, performing or exhibiting a copyrighted piece, or communicating it to the public. If the work has not been clearly made available not just to others but to the public in general, the exception does not apply, as in HRH the Prince of Wales v Associated Newspapers. Although Prince Charles had distributed copies of his diary to 75 people, this clearly did not make the journals available to the public, as each recipient was under strict instructions to keep the work confidential. The dealing must also be shown to have been fair, taking into account the many factors considered by the courts. Bently and Sherman suggest that in relation to fair dealings for criticism or review, the most relevant aspects considered by the court are likely to be the quantity taken, the method of acquisition and the consequences.Bently & Sherman (2009) p.211 =Reporting of current events= Under Section 30(2), fair dealing using any work for the purpose of reporting current events, with sufficient acknowledgement, is a valid exception to copyright. Photographs are excluded, however; Cornish, Llewelyn and Aplin write that this is \\"in order to preserve the full value of holding a unique visual record of some person or event\\".Cornish, Llewelyn & Aplin (2010) p.503 A crucial element of the \\"current events\\" exception is whether or not the reporting covers \\"current\\" events. \\"The older the issue, the less likely it is that it will be treated as having any currency\\". Hyde Park confirmed that, where an event that took place some time ago is still being discussed, that can be treated as \\"current\\". The nature of \\"events\\" must also be confirmed; while some things will be inherently considered events, such as matters of national importance, major sporting contests or important political occasions, others may not be. Matters that are \\"trivial, ephemeral or immaterial\\" may not be treated as events, although it has been confirmed that media attention can transform a trivial matter into an \\"event\\", as in Pro Sieben. The copyrighted works must also directly deal with the current events; Associated Newspapers v News Group Newspapers,[1986] RPC 515 for example, concerned the republication of correspondence between Wallis Simpson and her husband on the occasion of Simpson's death. It was held that the correspondence did not relate closely enough to the death for the fair dealing exception to apply.Bently & Sherman (2009) p.215 The dealing must also be \\"fair\\", with the most important factors being the quantity of the work used, whether or not use of the copyrighted work is necessary, and whether or not the work has been previously published. The Court of Appeal has confirmed in Ashdown that the defence should always be available \\"where the public interest in learning of the very words written by the owner of the copyright is such that the publication should not be inhibited by the chilling factor of having to pay damages or account of profits\\".Bently & Sherman (2009) p.216 Sufficient acknowledgement to the original author is also necessary for all works where the fair dealing exception is applied. Under Section 30(3), however, this is not required for reporting via a sound recording, film or broadcast where it would be \\"impossible for reasons of practicality or otherwise\\".Bently & Sherman (2009) p.217 =Parody, caricature and pastiche= As of 1 October 2014, Section 30A provides for fair dealing as a defence in cases where the infringement was for the purpose of caricature, parody or pastiche. The Intellectual Property Office suggests that a \\"parody\\" is something that imitates a work for humorous or satirical effect, a \\"pastiche\\" is a composition that is made up of selections from various sources or one that imitates the style of another artist or period, and that a \\"caricature\\" is something that portrays its subject in a simplified or exaggerated way, whether insulting or complimentary and whether for a political purpose or solely for entertainment. =Quotation= The same 2014 amendment also broadened the scope of the fair dealing defence for the \\"quotation\\" of suitably acknowledged published works for the purposes of \\"criticism or review\\", to \\"criticism, review or otherwise.\\"  Enforcement and procedure  If a claim of copyright infringement is brought and the copyright holder seeks an interim injunction restricting publication, courts will not usually grant this if the defendant pleads fair dealing.

The aircraft had departed minutes earlier from Tzaneen, and were flying in formation towards Johannesburg when they struck the mountain in cloud. The subsequent investigation found no evidence of any technical problem with the aircraft and cited adverse weather and poor flight planning as factors in the accident. History of the flight The two Albatross aircraft had participated the previous day in the Tzaneen Air Show, and in the morning of 14 August at around 10:20 local time, they took off from Tzaneen Airfield to return to Rand Airport in Johannesburg. Each aircraft had one pilot on board; one aircraft had five passengers and the other one six. The pair set off on a southerly heading flying in formation. After failing to arrive at Johannesburg, at 13:30 the aircraft were reported missing, and a search and rescue operation was launched. No distress call was received by air traffic control or other aircraft. Hampered by adverse weather and by the fact that no flight plan had been filed by either pilot, search teams were able to locate the wreckage of the aircraft only two days later. Both aircraft had collided with a north-facing, near-vertical escarpment on the slopes of Mamotswiri Peak, in the Wolkberg mountain range, and were completely destroyed by the impact and subsequent fire. The two wreckages were found apart at the foot of the cliff, at an altitude of , around below the top of the ridge. There were no survivors. On the day of the accident, a witness in the Lekgalameetse Valley reported seeing both aircraft overflying the valley before disappearing into low clouds. A loud bang was heard shortly after. Aircraft The aircraft involved were both twin-engined Piaggio P.166S Albatross, with registrations ZS-NJX and ZU-MMI, serial numbers 446 and 462. They were built in 1973 as coastal patrol, search and rescue aircraft for the South African Air Force, but subsequently retired and sold to private owners. The accident investigation found that both aircraft were properly maintained, and that no major problems had emerged during their recent mandatory periodic inspections. None of the aircraft was fitted with either flight data recorders or emergency locator transmitters, and there was no regulatory requirement to fit such equipments. Crew and passengers The pilot of ZS-NJX held a commercial pilot licence and had logged around 4,300 hours of flight in total. He also held an instrument rating, and during the accident flight he was leading the formation. The pilot of ZU-MMI, instead, held a private pilot licence with approximately 2,900 hours, and was not instrument-rated. Both pilots had flown in and out of Tzaneen on numerous occasions before. The 11 passengers were South African nationals, some returning to the country for a holiday, and included two children. Investigation The South African Civil Aviation Authority (SACAA) was in charge of the accident investigation. In its final report, it concluded that the probable cause of the crash was controlled flight into terrain, and cited as contributory factors \\"lack of proper flight planning\\" and low clouds present in the Wolkberg area at the time of the flight. No evidence was found of any pre-existing defects or mechanical problems with either aircraft.

Works =Where Things Come Back= Just when seventeen- year-old Cullen Witter thinks he understands everything about his small and painfully dull Arkansas town, his knowledge all disappears. In the summer before Cullen's senior year, a nominally-depressed birdwatcher named John Barling tries to validate the spotting of a species of woodpecker thought to be extinct since the 1940s in Cullen's hometown of Lily, Arkansas. His attempts to find the so-called Lazarus Woodpecker bring a flurry of press and woodpecker experts from all over the U.S to the previously tame and static town. However, the townspeople of Lily hope that the woodpecker who was brought back to life will put some life back into their town. All the kids start getting woodpecker haircuts, everyone eats the new \\"Lazarus burgers\\", and everyone shares their cheer about the woodpecker, everyone except for Cullen, that is. Cullen sees the town's preoccupation with the Lazarus woodpecker as an absurd carnival with John Barling as the carnival's crazy ringmaster. Nothing is more startling though for Cullen and the people of Lily, Arkansas than the realization that Cullen's sensitive, gifted fifteen- year-old brother Gabriel has suddenly and inexplicably disappeared. While Cullen navigates his way through a summer of finding and losing love, holding his fragile family together, and muddling his way into adulthood, a young missionary in Africa, who has lost his faith, searches for any semblance of meaning wherever he can find it. As distant as the two stories seem at the start, they are thoughtfully woven ever closer together and through masterful plotting, brought face to face in a surprising and harrowing climax. Complex but truly extraordinary, tinged with melancholy and regret, comedy and absurdity, this novel finds wonder in the ordinary and emerges as ultimately hopeful. It's about a lot more than what Cullen calls, \\"that damn bird.\\" It's about the dream of second chances and things coming back. =Noggin= Travis Coates was alive once and then he wasn't.

Five years later, it was reattached to some other guy's body, and well, here he is. Despite all logic, he's still 16 and everything and everyone around him has changed. That includes his bedroom, his parents, his best friend, and his girlfriend. Or maybe she's not his girlfriend anymore? That's a bit fuzzy too. Looks like if the new Travis and the old Travis are ever going to find a way to exist together, then there are going to be a few more scars. Oh well, you only live twice. =Highly Illogical Behavior= Sixteen-year-old Solomon Reed is agoraphobic. He hasn't left the house in three years, two months, and one day, which is fine by him.

Determined to \\"fix\\" Sol, Lisa steps into his world, along with her charming boyfriend, Clark, and soon enough the three form an unexpected bond. But, as Lisa learns more about Sol and he and Clark grow closer and closer, the walls they've built around themselves start to collapse and their friendships threaten to do the same.

Painted in oils on a canvas measuring 40 x 50 inches, it was created in 1934 for the federal government's first Depression-era program for artists, the half-year Public Works of Art Project. In October 1934 it entered the collection of the Museum of Fine Arts, Springfield, Massachusetts. History In February 1934, Dickinson was invited to participate in the Public Works of Art Project, which offered him weekly pay and an exhibition of the painting in Washington in May. He finished the work on time by reworking an abandoned painting, one of a small group done from imagination on a favorite subject, polar exploration,Ward, 2003, pp. 87‚Äì92. and changing its title to Stranded Brig.Ward, 2003, pp. 133‚Äì41. According to art historian John L. Ward, Dickinson's painting had begun life as Loss of the Tegethoff, the third painting of a series on the subject of the stranding of that ship in polar ice, left off after about 15 sittings in the fall of 1930. Ward points out that the size is the same,Ward, 2003, pp. 138, 239: note 47. that it represented \\"boat, smoke, ice and rocks,\\" and that the tally of sittings Dickinson reported putting in on the painting to date in a letter written 31 March 1934 (\\"about 40\\") does not match the number entered in his journals unless the \\"about 15 sittings\\" he had put in on the earlier painting are added in.Ward, 2003, p. 138. In the final version the ice has disappeared and upended rocks resembling those he had painted in The Glen are present. The picture also contains the skeleton of a whaleboat in the foreground, along with an improbable weasel caught in a trap (lower left), falling rocks (left side), and a dangling walkway (left side) and steps (lower right), that Dickinson said were like those at Watkins Glen, New York, or some such place for tourists.Ward, 2003, pp. 133‚Äì134. Analysis Adler's identification of the stranded ship with the artist, \\"crushed by life's vicissitudes\\",Adler, 1982, p.126. is based on his mistaking the mists, produced, according to Dickinson, by much colder air coming into contact with the warmer water, for a representation of a violent storm tearing the ship apart. But evidence, both internal and external, support Adler's interpretation: the upended rocks do appear to crush the ship, and the depicted rock formations and Watkins Glen, referred to by Dickinson in discussing the picture's man-made structures, both pertain to his native region of western New York state, as does the trapped weasel, based on one he had found in a glen in Sheldrake.Ward, 2003, p. 140. And neither these, nor the falling rocks are connected with the supposed topic of his painting (described in a letter of 1934 as the \\"stranding of Dr. Kane's brig 'Advance' on the Greenland coast\\").Ward, 2003, p.133. Rather, the ruined state of the walkways and stairs and the upended terrain, like the trapped weasel and the crushed ship and whaleboat reinforce the idea of a situation without escape that leaves him feeling trapped and crushed, with the ground collapsing and rocks falling from above. Biographical events may also have contributed to Dickinson's feelings: he had a bout with ulcers in 1933; he experienced back pains bad enough to wear a back brace from June 1931 until after Stranded Brig was complete; and on July 1, 1934 he entered the hospital for a battery of tests. The tests were inconclusive, but Dickinson's daughter believes the real problem was depression, a family problem that had led to the death of his older brother, Burgess, in 1913Ward, 2003, p. 141. and was perhaps exacerbated by his still-unresolved struggle with Woodland Scene, on which he had at that time spent five and a half years. When Dickinson's brother Burgess jumped to his death, his eldest brother Howard told the press that Burgess often became depressed when he felt that his work hadn't achieved the level of excellence he set for himself,Ward, 2003, p. 139. and Dickinson, who called his brother \\"the chief influence in my entire life\\", may well have felt the same way. Indeed, his reported comments about Stranded Brig, probably in the fall or winter of 1932,Ward, 2003, pp. 138‚Äì39, 236: note 48. before it was reworked for the PWAP, indicate the pressure he felt to do justice not only to this picture but to the unfinished Woodland Scene, which was becoming more difficult to finish than he had expected.Driscoll, 1985, pp. 94, 124: note 59. According to Provincetown painter Bruce McKain, Dickinson had shown him the picture of boats in ice, told him that it was not finished and he wouldn't finish it without doing \\"justice to the way it should be. [He said,] 'I wouldn't any more finish it that way than I'd throw myself out of this window.'\\"Ward, 2003, p. 239. Notes References *Abell, Mary Ellen and Helen Dickinson Baldwin.

Life Greene was born at Lichfield in 1716. The Rev. Joseph Greene (1712‚Äì1790) (Gent. Mag. 1790, i. 574), headmaster of Stratford-upon- Avon grammar school, was his brother, and Johnson was his relation. He lived and died as a surgeon and apothecary in Lichfield; a Scottish university conferred on him, it is said, the degree of M.D., but though highly gratified he never assumed the title of doctor. In 1758 he was sheriff of the city of Lichfield; he was bailiff in 1785 and in 1790, and was one of the city aldermen. Greene was the first to establish a printing press at Lichfield, and from about 1748 until his death his zeal in collecting objects of interest never flagged. He deposited these curiosities in the ancient registry office of the bishops of that see, which stood nearly opposite the south door of the cathedral, and has long since been pulled down. A view of one side of the room of this museum, sent by the Rev. Henry White of Lichfield, appeared in the 'Gentleman's Magazine' for 1788, pt. ii. 847, and was reproduced in Stebbing Shaw's History of Staffordshire. The fame of his collections spread far and wide, and the building was open gratuitously on every day except Sundays. After a life entirely spent in the city of his birth he died there on 4 June 1793, aged 77. His first wife was named Dawson, and by her he had one daughter, who married William Wright of Lichfield. His second wife was Theodosia Webb of Croxall in Derbyshire, who died at Lichfield on 1 August 1793; she had one son, Thomas, a lieutenant and surgeon in the Stafford militia. Greene's portrait, with the motto,described by Boswell \\"truly characteristical of his disposition, Nemo sibi vivat\\", was engraved in his lifetime, and is inserted in Shaw's 'Staffordshire,' i. 308. A token still exists of him, and is described in 'Notes and Queries,' 1st ser. i. 167, 1850. On one side is represented his bust, with the words 'Richard Greene, collector of the Lichfield Museum, died 4 June 1793, aged 77;' on the other appears a Gothic window, lettered 'west porch of Lichfield Cathedral,' 1800. Collections The Thrale family and Dr. Johnson visited and admired Greene's museum in July 1774. Two years later Johnson and Boswell viewed it together. Boswell admired the \\"wonderful collection\\" with the neat labels, printed at Greene's own press, and the board with the \\"names of contributors marked in gold letters\\" Boswell took 'a hasty glance' at the addition in 1779. There was printed at Lichfield in 1773 \\"a descriptive catalogue of the rarities in Mr. Greene's museum at Lichfield\\", with a dedication to Ashton Lever, \\"from whose noble repository some of the most curious of the rarities had been drawn\\". In the five-paged list of benefactors to the collection occur the names of Boulton of Soho Works, Birmingham, Doctor Darwin, Charles Darwin, Peter Garrick, Dr. Johnson, Pennant, Pegge, Dr. Taylor of Ashbourne, and Dr. Withering. A \\"general syllabus of its contents\\" and a second edition of the catalogue were published in 1782. The third edition was issued in 1786. In 1773 the collection was rich in coins, crucifixes, watches, and specimens of natural history; by 1786 it had been augmented by additions of minerals, orreries, deeds and manuscripts, missals, muskets, and specimens of armour. It also contained numerous curiosities from the South Sea Islands, which had been given by David Samwell, surgeon of the Discovery, to Miss Seward, who transferred them to Greene, and thus enabled him to obtain a medal struck off by the Royal Society in honour of Captain Cook. A few years after Greene's death the collection was broken up. In 1799 his son sold the fossils and minerals to Sir John St. Aubyn for ¬£100. Next year Bullock bought for a hundred and fifty guineas the arms and armour which were first exhibited at his museum in the Egyptian Hall, and were afterwards added to the collections of Sir Samuel Meyrick and in the Tower of London. Nearly the whole of the remaining curiosities were sold for ¬£600 to Walter Honeywood Yates of Bromsberrow Place, near Gloucester, who made many additions, and in 1801 printed a catalogue of the whole. Most of these afterwards became the property of Richard Wright, surgeon at Lichfield (who was Greene's grandson, being the fifth son of the daughter who married William Wright), and at his death in 1821 the complete contents of his house were again scattered. Greene was a frequent contributor to the pages of the Gentleman's Magazine. A woodcut from his sketch of a tombstone found in 1746 among the ruins of the friary at Lichfield appeared in its number for September 1746, p. 465; and so late in his life as 1790 he communicated to it a notice of a manual of devotion, written on vellum, and formerly belonging to Catherine Parr, the last wife of Henry VIII. A list of many of these articles, and several of his letters on antiquarian topics are printed by Nichols. Stebbing Shaw was favoured by Greene's son with the loan of some valuable manuscripts and plates from the museum for use in his History of Staffordshire, and he embodied in his account of Lichfield a description of the collection. When Johnson was desirous of placing an epitaph for his father, mother, and brother on the spot in the middle aisle in St. Michael's Church at Lichfield, where their bones rested, he sent the lines to Greene. Greene contributed some anecdotes of Johnson to 'Johnsoniana' (Boswell, 1835, ed. ix. 248).

Early life Greene, the son of Robert Greene, a mercer of Tamworth, Staffordshire, by his wife Mary Pretty of Fazeley, was born about 1678. His father, who according to the son was a repository of all the Christian virtues, died while Greene was a boy, and it was through the generosity of his uncle, John Pretty, rector of Farley, Hampshire, that he was sent to Clare Hall, Cambridge. He graduated B.A. 1699, and M.A. 1703. He became a fellow and tutor of his college and took orders. Career and works In 1711 he published 'A Demonstration of the Truth and Divinity of the Christian Religion,' and in the following year 'The Principles of Natural Philosophy, in which is shown the insufficiency of the present systems to give us any just account of that science.' The latter work was ridiculed and parodied in 'A Taste of Philosophical Fanaticism ... by a gentleman of the University of Gratz.' Greene, while taking an active part in college and parochial work, was convinced that the whole field of knowledge was his proper province, and devoted many years' leisure to the production of his next work, a large folio volume of 980 pages, entitled 'The Principles of the Philosophy of the Expansive and Contractive Forces, or an Enquiry into the Principles of the Modern Philosophy, that is, into the several chief Rational Sciences which are extant,' 1727. In the preface Greene, after being at some pains to prove himself a whig, declared his intention of proposing a philosophy, English, Cantabrigian, and Clarensian, which he ventured to call the 'Greenian,' because his name was 'not much worse in the letters which belonged to it than those of Galileo and Descartes.' The book is a monument of ill-digested and misapplied learning. In 1727 Greene served as proctor at Cambridge University, and in the next year he proceeded D.D. He died at Birmingham 16 Aug. 1730, and was buried at All Saints, Cambridge, where he had for three years officiated. In his will he named eight executors, five being heads of Cambridge colleges, and directed that his body should be dissected and the skeleton hung up in the library of King's College; monuments to his memory were to be placed in the chapels of Clare and King's colleges, in St. Mary's Church, and at Tamworth, for each of which he supplied a long description of himself; finally, Clare Hall was to publish his posthumous works, and on condition of observing this and his other directions was to receive his estate, failing which it was to go to St. John's, Trinity, and Jesus colleges, and on refusal of each to Sidney Sussex. None of his wishes were complied with, and it was stated by a relative of Greene (Gent. Mag. 1783, ii. 657) that his effects remained with Sidney Sussex, but that college preserves no record of having received the benefactions.

Education and early career Groenveldt, born about 1647, was a native of Deventer in Holland. He was educated partly in Holland and then under Franciscus Zyp√¶us (the younger) at Louvain, and in Paris. On 13 September 1667 he was entered as a medical student at Leyden, but graduated M.D. at Utrecht on 18 March 1670. His thesis, De Calculo Vesic√¶ (Utrecht, 1670), was translated into English and published in London in 1677, and with large additions in 1710. About 1673 he was appointed physician in chief to the garrison at Grave. Ten years afterwards he came to England, settled in Throgmorton Street, London, and was admitted a licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians on 2 April 1683. Charges of malpractice Supported by powerful patronage he passed as a specialist on gout and stone, but was regarded by most of his brethren as a quack. In 1693 he was summoned before the college for mala praxis in the internal use of cantharidin, but was not punished. In April 1697 he was again summoned for the same offence, and was fined and committed to Newgate Prison, but was soon released.Narcissus Luttrell, Brief Historical Relation..., iv. 214) A female patient, to whom he is said to have administered thirty-six grains of the medicine, brought an action against him on the following 7 December, but though nearly twenty members of the college appeared on her behalf, a verdict was given in his favour. He in turn sued the college for wrongful imprisonment, but the court gave judgment for the defendants on 8 June 1700. In May 1710 Groenveldt was living opposite the Sun Tavern, Threadneedle Street, but died apparently in the same year. Writings Groenveldt, or Greenfield, as he sometimes styled himself in England, was the author of a small treatise on his favourite medicine, entitled Tutus Cantharidum in medicina Usus internus, 1698 (2nd edition, 1703), which was translated into English, with additions, by John Marten, surgeon, in 1706. He wrote also: *Dissertatio Lithologica, 1684; 2nd edition, 1687. *Practica Medica, 1688. *Arthritology; or a Discourse of the Gout, 1691. *Fundamenta Medicinse scriptoribus ‚Ä¶ pr√¶stantioribus deprompta [anon.], 1714; 2nd edition, with author's name (1715).

Dedicated to the creation and performance of high energy music, they are known for playing songs based on video games and for their covers of songs from popular television shows and movies. History Random Encounter was formed from a literal series of random encounters in 2005 when two friends discovered a mutual interest in video game music. While a few incarnations of the band have existed over the years, the group most well known as Random Encounter formed in September 2010 (consisting of all new members) and transformed the band into an energetic act with the goal of being as much fun to watch as they are to listen to. Drawing from its roots as a video game cover band, Random Encounter began to create original music inspired by video game culture. These originals are strongly inspired by songs and stories from video games, often pulling from video games like Metroid, Dead Space, and the Legend of Zelda, and aim to condense the experience of a video game into a 3-4 minute song. The cover songs Random Encounter plays are arranged for a rock environment and during live performances songs are often grouped together into melodies by series. Random Encounter is also well known for their high energy and visual antics at their live shows and for their frequent use of guest musicians. In a 2012 interview with Powet TV Random Encounter \\"admitted\\" that their musical endeavors were a cover for their affiliation with the occult-hunting branch of the Russian military. Interviews, stage banter, and their official website from 2009-2012 also suggested that the fictitious mission of the band, and the majority of the band's back story revolved around the elimination of paranormal creatures such as Werewolves, Vampires, Zombies, and Jerks, however the band ceased making this claim in mid-2012 after too many of their fans were confused and genuinely believed them to be from Russia. Random Encounter has gained a fanatical following throughout the Florida nerd-music scene and throughout the east coast by becoming a part of the world's first video game themed band tour, Player Vs Performer. They have performed at venues like Nerdapalooza, MAGFest, Gencon, Otakon, SXSW, the Hard Rock Live (Orlando), led a parade of zombies, and have played in practically every major city on the east coast. Random Encounter still frequently performs throughout the Southeast United States. Notably, Random Encounter was selected as the Best Rock Act in Central Florida for 2013, the Best Indie Act in Central Florida for 2012, and the Best Folk Act in Central Florida for 2011. Badassoftheweek.com described Random Encounter as being \\"like all the awesomeness of playing Castlevania on the NES in Port Royale in the 17th century without all the syphilis or cutlass wounds.\\" During the winter of 2014, Random Encounter went on a 10-day tour of Europe with Video Games Live, traveling through the UK, France, Finland, Sweden, and Spain. Later that same year Random Encounter composed music for the video game, Super Galaxy Squadron. In 2016 the band announced on their social media that it would be on an indefinite hiatus and in a 2017 radio interview they said they had no plans to perform again or release new albums after Lost Frequency. Random Encounter has performed with such acts as They Might Be Giants, Nobuo Uematsu's band the Earthbound Papas, Less than Jake, Andrew WK, Voltaire (musician), Steam Powered Giraffe, Vivid, as a part of Video Games Live, and been a TEDxSarasota Speaker and Performer.

Painted in oils on a canvas measuring 60 x 48 1/2 inches, it was begun in 1924 and finished in 1926. In 1988 it was purchased by the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco. History The fourth of Dickinson's paintings that art historian John Driscoll identified as major and symbolical, The Cello Player (1924‚Äì26) took the longest to paint of works to that date. Again, the dominant figure is an old man, here posed for by a different model, ostensibly playing a cello in a room littered with objects and seen from above, so that the space tips up to a horizon well above the picture top. The progressive tipping and enclosure of space can be observed in the sequence of works leading up to this one, a strategy that tends to equalize the parts of the picture and enhance their pictorial interaction. But although this parallels modernist tendencies toward pictorial abstraction accompanied by spatial flattening, the figure and objects in this picture give up none of their volume or tactile presence as objects. Analysis Sheet music from a Beethoven quartet leads us into the picture and, with the two keyboard instruments at the right, suggests again the equation of painting and music, a notion widely accepted among Provincetown artists, as well as members of Steiglitz's circle, in particular Marsden Hartley.Ward 2003, p. 94. That the music in the picture is purely visual is once again indicated by the picture's undermined narrative coherence, with objects positioned not for use but to create visual rhythms and harmonies,Elisabeth L. Cary already recognized this point in her review, \\"American Section in Carnegie International,\\" New York Times, 24 October 1926, sect. 10, p. 11. and more explicitly by preventing the cellist from playing. The hand that would finger the notes is not in position and the bow hand has no bow to play with.Ward 2003, p. 95. A photograph taken while the painting was in progress shows that the cellist originally held a bow (Marc Simpson, \\"Edwin Dickinson's The Cello Player,\\" Triptych, Sept.-Oct. 1988, fig. 4). Further, the music is for a string quartet, but only one string instrument is present and the cellist's position prevents the piano, not a stringed instrument in any case, from being played. But the formal character of the painting does not mean that the objects have no meaning. Dickinson himself admitted that many of them represented his interests at the time, including a book on the Arctic explorer Fridtjof Nansen,Goodrich 1966, p. 7. and Driscoll notes that a teapot on the right was one given to Dickinson by a Southern woman who told him that General Sherman had once used it.Driscoll 1985, p. 70. Moreover, Driscoll believes the meanings go deeper. Specifically, he sees the painting as a tribute to Beethoven, the composer he honored above all others,Driscoll 1985, pp. 72‚Äì73. and, through him, to his deceased brother Burgess, pianist and composer, whom his fellow students at Yale had nicknamed \\"Beethoven.\\"Driscoll 1985, p. 75. He observes that the score that Dickinson chose to depict, flanked on the right by a corner of music from Mozart's \\"Marriage of Figaro,\\" was the string quartet in which Beethoven displays his greatest indebtedness to Mozart.Driscoll 1985, p. 74. Driscoll argues that Dickinson intended thereby to express his lasting gratitude to his brother, whom he deeply admired, just as Beethoven showed his admiration for Mozart in the depicted score. But such a reading equates Burgess with Mozart, the teacher, and Dickinson with Beethoven, his student, although, as Driscoll points out, it was Burgess who was called Beethoven by school mates, friends, and colleagues.Driscoll 1985, p. 73. A different reading, one that supports Driscoll's basic conclusion but identifies Burgess as Beethoven, turns on the question of why Dickinson chose to depict the second violin part to represent the quartet, given the fact that without the melody of the first violin something essential is missing. The choice confirms his intention to express his indebtedness to his brother by suggesting that he played second fiddle to Burgess's Beethoven. Ward connects this and other roses in Dickinson's paintings with a note that Dickinson wrote in the margin of his journal from 1970 next to the name of Alie M√∂rling: \\"The rose when Burgess died.\\"Ward 2003, p. 96. He believes that Alie may have given Edwin a rose on that occasion and that the smell and sight of roses may have recalled that event to him and caused its association in his mind with the kindness and beauty of women.Ward 2003, pp. 96‚Äì97. He believes that by this time Dickinson was probably familiar with Proust's description of taste and smell awakening recollections of the past. Dickinson may have turned down the head of the cellist to contribute to the effect of a view from an elevated position, as well as the eliminate the gaze, which would overemphasize the head and weaken the effect of allover visual flow. But it also suggests that the cellist is dreaming, which contributes to the idea of recollection. Dickinson records having had dreams numerous times in his journals, and on 13 March 1925, while painting The Cello Player, he wrote \\"Dreamed of Burg[ess].\\" Dickinson, Journals, 13 March 1925. Reel D93. In his painting Villa and Alice, 1941, the woman appears quite clearly to be dreaming. Further, in the three large studio paintings following The Cello Player (The Fossil Hunters, Woodland Scene, and Composition with Still Life) the world that Dickinson creates has become so difficult to reconcile with waking experience that the paintings demand to be seen as dreams or visions.

Thanks to the ICC, the Days of Muslim Culture in Russia became traditional, the first Muslim TV programs All Koran Suras and Thousand and One Day: Muslim Encyclopedia were broadcast.Islamic Cultural Center In 1990s the ICC of Russia actively assisted the development of Hadj system in Russia, built more than 70 mosques in various regions of the country, participated in creation of educational infrastructure, assisted unification of Muslim clergy into Russian Muftis Council under spiritual guidance of which it still works. Developing interconfessional and interethnic dialogue and cooperation, A.V. Niyazov has established functional relationship with the main Russian religions representatives, and above all with the Russian Orthodox Church. Under his guidance the ICC of Russia has also developed strong relationship with the Vatican, the Dalai Lama and other world religious centers. For the past 20 years A.-V. Niyazov has been initiating interconfessional meetings, conferences and panel discussions, participating in programs of intercommunity cooperation, and in programs of opposition to international terrorism, extremism, nationalism, growing islamophobia and xenophobia, assisting the settlement of conflict in the Chechen Republic.Mosques in Chechya: Site of President of Cjecjen Republic In the early 1990s he, as a head of the ICC of Russia, initiated entrance of Russia into the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (now ‚Äì the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, OIC), which he views as not only strategic, but also economic profit for Russia. This initiative has gained support from Russian Muslim community and, due to the Russian President Vladimir Putin‚Äôs goodwill, in June 2005 Russia received a status of observer in Organization Islamic Cooperation. The ICC of Russia has always supported complex development of Russian foreign policy and balanced cooperation both with East and West. In accordance to this principle, constructive cooperation with major Muslim international organizations, including the Organization of the Islamic Conference, the Muslim World League, and World Islamic Appeal Association was established. The ICC constantly supports business contacts with Muslim community in more than 20 European and 40 Muslim countries. In almost 19 years the ICC of Russia has held about 20 major international conferences and forums, several dozens of panel discussions, symposiums and other events that met with a wide response in Russia and abroad. During the past year the ICC of Russia under A.V. Niazov's guidance participated in projects vital for the Russian Ummah. They include International Conference Russia ‚Äì Muslim World: Partnership for Stability in September 2009; preparation of a concept of a Muslim TV channel, which was initiated by the Russian President Dmitry Medvedev in 2009; and launching of big project on unification of centralized spiritual Muslim structures of Russia, which was blessed by all three key leaders of Russian Muslims ‚Äì head of Russian Muftis Council Rawil Gaynetdin, head of Central Muslim Spiritual Directorate Talgat Tadzhuddin and head of the Coordination Center of North Caucasus Muslims Ismail Berdiyev.

Biography  Intending to be a manga artist from his childhood days, majored in physics in college as preparation to draw science fiction works, and also to learn the technology of performance and imaging, went on to graduate school to major in image technology. In 1993, while still enrolled, debuted in a Korean girls manhwa magazine. Since then, he gained popularity releasing a number of works and publishing books on how to draw manga targeting a wide range of reader. In 2004 he stepped into the world of Japanese manga. His ‚ÄúUltimate Space Emperor Caesar‚Äù, serialized in Monthly ‚ÄúComic Gum‚Äù, was his first tank≈çbon in Japan. In 2005, 9 out of 11 of Boichi‚Äôs hentai one-shot serialized in the Comic Aun were reunited under the volume titled ‚ÄúLover in Winter‚Äù. In 2006, he released two science fiction one- shot, ‚ÄúHotel‚Äù and ‚ÄúPresent‚Äù which, in 2008, were compiled in a volume titled Hotel along the other one-shots ‚ÄúIt was all for the tuna‚Äù, ‚ÄúStephanos‚Äù and ‚ÄúDiadem‚Äù. 2006 is the year of Boichi‚Äôs first serialized manga: ‚ÄúSun Ken Rock‚Äù in the bi-weekly magazine Young King. This manga will also have a side-story based on Yumin in 2011 and one based on Pickaxe in 2012. 2012 will also see the serialization of ‚ÄúI want to feed Yumin‚Äù, another spin-off of Sun Ken Rock based on Yumin and serialized in ‚ÄúMonthly Young King‚Äù. I want to feed Yumin is about the main character of Sun Ken Roc, treating Yumin to traditional Korean food. Boichi also worked on a 5 volume long manga titled Raqiya and written by Masao Yajima where he was in charge of the art and published in 2009. He also only did the art of the Brutality one-shot by Takeda Yuusuke in 2007. In later 2011, he started the serialization of another manga titled ‚ÄúH.E the hunt for energy‚Äù in a new monthly magazine: Jump X. In this year, he won the Gran Guinigi prize for ‚ÄúIt was all for the Tuna‚Äù, about a scientist doing anything to revive the extinct tuna, so even experimenting anything tuna-related, sacrificing his own happiness.

The influence of years of stitching shows in her street art, for example, at a construction wall on the Jewish History Museum in Amsterdam, el stapled voodoo dolls made of business suits alongside giant wheat-pasted versions of the figures painted in acrylic. Livni was inspired in 2005 by the British artist Banksy to distribute copies of her serialized novel Between Epiphanies in New York. The book was placed surreptitiously in subway ad spaces and other public and private places throughout the city. Fellow artist Win stenciled the faces of the literary and historical figures that appear in Between Epiphanies on the sidewalks and buildings of Brooklyn. Wisconsin Public Radio's Radio Without Borders interviewed Livni about the book, which retells the Sufi adventure story, Conference of the Birds, in a postmodern context. The writer presented the novel and distribution campaign at the University of Wisconsin- Madison's \\"50th Anniversary of Peace Corps in Africa\\" Conference, where she was discussing her Peace Corps volunteer work in Senegal from 2001-2002 (for which artist Shepard Fairey did the commemorative poster ); she was also featured on National Public Radio's StoryCorps blog. In 2010 and 2011 (between writing legal briefs and visiting jails) she began stickering up the signs on the island of Palm Beach and in West Palm Beach. Authority Issue began with Livni placing her handmade stickers on street signs and buildings. She then photographed the signs with the stickers and made new stickers out of the photos, which she placed throughout the city, especially on street signs. These were then photographed and so on, with the artist intending to fill the city's public spaces with a bizarre and mystifying collage of warnings, threats and prohibitions. In the summer of 2011, she began work on a new campaign, klompkunst, in Amsterdam. Klompkunst means \\"clog art\\" in Dutch and, klompkunst was a collection of hundreds of hand painted and silk screened clogs, a reference to early and late Andy Warhol works that also aimed to keep in mind local tradition.

It is a play with only one character, written in 1944 and published in the acclaimed literary journal \\"Shonibarer Chithi\\" in 1945 & as a book in 1948. Nemesis, a tragedy, set a milestone in the history of Bengali literature because of its unique feature and modern plot. National professor of Bangladesh Kabir Chowdhury explains, ‚ÄúNemesis is his (Nurul Momen's) most famous work. It is an experimental drama where through dialogues the main and only character remembers his past. It shows how a promising personality falls prey to greed and loses his morality. Though it is a play based on one actor, the scope of the plot is wide and a number of other characters come in through the main character's reminiscences.‚Äù It was also the first experimental Bengali play, as Nemesis contains only one character. This experiment was done earlier than Nurul Momen only by Eugene O'Neill and Jean Cocteau in the entire history of world theater. In fact, the two plays Rupantor and Nemesis by Nurul Momen, ushered in the modernism of theatre of East Bengal, subsequently called East Pakistan and finally becoming the independent Bangladesh. Before Nemesis only a few playwrights had attempted a one-character play, but none had the full form of a play continuing for one and a half hours without break. Nurul Momen did not only adorn the play with witty dialogues, but also made the character recite poems and even sing. His conversations over the phone, with neighbours, with his conscience and lastly with his murderer is drawn in such an ingenious way that the absence of these characters on the stage is never felt. Not for once the audience can get bored because of the unpredictable turn of the events cleverly knitted in the plot. Written against the backdrop of Bengal famine of the early 1940s, Nemesis depicts the moral predicaments of a middle-class schoolteacher Surojit Nandi. Surojit married Sulota, daughter of the dishonest, affluent Nripen Bose. Nripen gives Surojit an ultimatum that if he [Surojit] can not earn five hundred thousand Taka within three months, he won't accept the latter's marriage to his daughter. Surojit is left with no other option but to undertake several unethical actions. Eventually he wants to break free from the wrong path but he is denied by Nemesis, the Greek goddess of Retribution & Vengeance.

Starring Christine Hakim, Slamet Rahardjo, and N. Riantiarno, it tells the story of Ade, a young woman who falls in love with Bastian, an ex-convict, yet is engaged to Johny, who raped Bastian's wife and caused her to be killed in the resulting fight. It was well-received both critically and commercially, garnering five Citra Awards and launching Christine Hakim's career. Tabloid Bintang has listed it as the 19th best Indonesian film of all time. Production Cinta Pertama was directed by Teguh Karya. He chose then 16-year-old Christine Hakim for the lead role of Ade after he spotted her modeling in a teen magazine. Despite not wanting to act, Hakim was afraid to be impolite to the endearing Karya and did not refuse. She later described it as being \\"reeled in, slowly, slowly, like [by] a fisherman\\". The casting of Hakim did not sit well with the producer, who considered her too thin and her chest too small. Karya defended his choice, replying \\"Are we selling a film or are we selling breasts?\\" Plot Ade (Christine Hakim) and Bastian (Slamet Rahardjo) meet on a train bringing them to Jakarta. Bastian is on his way to a job interview, while Ade and her friends have just returned from a trip out of town. As they talk, they realize that Bastian's interview is at Ade's father's company. They soon develop romantic feelings for each other. However, Ade has unwillingly been promised in marriage to Johny (N. Riantiarno), the son of her father's business partner. Bastian is hired, but soon afterwards someone claiming to be his father-in-law comes and says that Bastian had killed his child. Then soon after that Bastian disappears, leaving behind a letter for Ade saying that he has returned to his hometown to help his stepparents with their flower garden. One day, Ade is out with Johny when she meets Bastian, who is delivering flowers. Bastian and Johny fight, with Bastian claiming that Johny had raped his wife; when Bastian tried to stop him, he accidentally killed her. Ade returns to Bastian and they are married. Johny later attempts to kill Bastian, only to be foiled and killed himself. Release and reception Cinta Pertama was released in 1973 to critical and commercial success. Christine Hakim won a Citra Award for Best Leading Actress, while Karya won one for directing. It also went second place for Best Film and won Best Cinematography and Best Music.

In 2010, Ade Irwansyah of Tabloid Bintang listed Cinta Pertama as the 19th best Indonesian film of all time, while another writer, El Masrur Sahlan, noted that Hakim and Rahardjo's on-screen chemistry was some of the best in the business, contributing to their future appearances together.

Launched in Malaysia in 2008, Bunga Mas Lima was the second ship owned by the Malaysian International Shipping Corporation (MISC) to be deployed to the Gulf of Aden following its launch on 8 August at the Malaysian Marine and Heavy Engineering Sdn Bhd shipyard in Pasir Gudang, Johor. Development The Bunga Mas Lima was built at Malaysian Marine and Heavy Engineering in Pasir Gudang, Johore together with her sister, KA Bunga Mas Enam (BM6). She was launched in year 1997, and was purchased by the Malaysian Government. The conversion included modifications to accommodate extra crew, fittings for launching rigid hull inflatable boats, a helicopter deck to accommodate landing and a hangar. The foreword crane of Bunga Mas Lima was taken out since its presence inhibited helicopter landing while the 2nd crane were rested to the starboard side of the ship above the hangar. Labeled as auxiliary vessel and manned by MISC crews, conscripted into the navy reserve, with Malaysian Armed Forces special operations on board, the ship is a signal that new warships are badly needed by the navy to fill in the gap on the absence of multipurpose support ships as all of them had been sent to Gulf of Aden during the piracy breakout. The ships, KD Sri Inderasakti, KD Mahawangsa and KD Sri Inderapura are either undergoing refurbishment or engaged in other duties within Malaysian waters. However, the current RMN warships, especially the multipurpose command and support ship and the LST, were not fitted with a helicopter hangar but only a landing pad, which is why the RMN opted to have a vessel such as Bunga Mas Lima. Without a hangar, it is almost immposible for a taskgroup to rely on to helicopter operations, as they cannot maintain and service the helicopter especially in rough sea conditions. On the contrary, the frigates and the NGPV's had themselves equipped for helicopter operation, with an enclosed hangar and a landing pad capable of receiving an Agusta Westland Super Lynx or a Eurocopter AS-555 Fennec helicopter. Major operation * In January 2011, the Royal Malaysian Navy foiled a hijacking attempt on the Malaysian-flagged MT Bunga Laurel chemical tanker carrying lubricating oil and ethylene dichloride. The KA Bunga Mas Lima responded after receiving a distress signal from the Bunga Laurel. A Fennec attack helicopter was used to pin down the pirate mothership as PASKAL commandos boarded the tanker. The commandos injured three pirates in the battle to retake the ship. 23 crew members were rescued and seven Somali pirates were detained. * On 5 February 2011, the Bunga Mas Lima was on duty in the Gulf of Aden and sailed to the Port of Adabiya, about two and a half hours' journey south of Cairo, to ferry 500 Malaysian students out of Egypt during the 2011 Egyptian revolution. Besides the Bunga Mas Lima, the Royal Malaysian Air Force deployed a C-130 Hercules.

It can be seen in the Gem√§ldegalerie Alte Meister in Dresden. It is his first genre painting and shows a scene of contemporary life, an image of mercenary love perhaps in a brothel. It differs from his earlier biblical and mythological scenes. It is one of only three paintings Vermeer signed and dated (the other two are The Astronomer and The Geographer). In 1696 the painting, being sold on an auction in Amsterdam, was named \\"A merry company in a room\\". The woman in black, the leering coupler, \\"in a nun's costume\\", could be the eponymous procuress, while the man to her right, \\"wearing a black beret and a doublet with slashed sleeves\\", has been identified as a self portrait of the artist. There is a resemblance with the painter in Vermeer's The Art of Painting. Vermeer is in the painting as a musician, in the employ of the madam. It seems Vermeer was influenced by earlier works on the same subject by Gerard ter Borch, and The Procuress (c. 1622) by Dirck van Baburen, which was owned by Vermeer's mother-in-law Maria Thins and hung in her home. Some critics thought the painting is atypical of Vermeer's style and expression, because it lacks the typical light. Pieter Swillens wrote in 1950 that--if the work was by Vermeer at all--it showed the artist \\"seeking and groping\\" to find a suitable mode of expression. Eduard Trautscholdt wrote 10 years before that \\"The temperament of the 24-year-old Vermeer fully emerges for the first time\\". The three-dimensional jug on the oriental rug is a piece of Westerwald Pottery. The kelim thrown over a bannister, probably produced in U≈üak, covers a third of the painting and shows medaillons and leaves. The instrument is probably a cittern. The dark coat with five buttons was added by Vermeer in a later stage. The man, a soldier, in the red jacket is fondling the young woman's breast and dropping a coin into her outstretched hand.. According to Benjamin Binstock this \\"dark and gloomy\\" painting could be understood as a psychological portrait of his adopted family and does not represent a didactic message. In his rather fictional book Binstock explains Vermeer used his family as models; the procuress could be Vermeer's wife Catherina and the lewd soldier her brother Willem.Dirck van Baburen, The Procuress, 1622, oil on canvas, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. The painting was owned by Maria Thins, mother-in-law of Johannes Vermeer, who reproduced it within two of his own paintings.In the catalogue of Essential Vermeer (click on the woman in black) Provenance and Exhibitions The painting was in the Waldstein collection in Dux (now Duchcov), then bought in 1741 for August III of Poland, the Elector of Saxony. The painting was exhibited in 1980 at the Restaurierte Kunstwerke in der Deutschen Demokratischen Republic exhibit in the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, Altes Museum. This painting should not be confused with another painting by the same name, by Dirck van Baburen, nor with a fake version once attributed to Vermeer which technical analysis in 2011 disclosed that there's Bakelite in the paint, definitely proving that the painting is a modern forgery. It was most probably executed by the notorious forger, Han van Meegeren, who was responsible for producing several fake Vermeers and known to use said resin to harden the paint. Painting materials The technical investigation of this painting was done in 1968 by Hermann K√ºhn. The pigment analysis revealed Vermeer's use of his usual pigments such as ultramarine in the blue wine jug and lead-tin- yellow in the jacket of the woman. He employed also smalt in the green parts of the tablecloth and in the greenish background which is less usual for him.

It is one of the main source of water for Cebu City and Metro Cebu. Part of Central Cebu Protected Landscape, Buhisan Dam is situated in the mountains of Barangay Buhisan behind Labangon, Cebu. Built in 1911-1912 and maintained by the Metro Cebu Water District, it is being developed into an eco-tourism location. It supplies five percent of Metropolitan Cebu Water District's (MCWD) current water capacity.  History  Because of the lack of potable water in Cebu, a cholera outbreak began to spread in the early 1900s which killed 559 people in the city which then had a population of 55,000, or about 1% of its population. A destructive fire in 1906 which destroyed millions worth of properties also proved the need of enough water supply for Cebu. Buhisan Dam was built to address devastating fires that could again hit the city, and the need for a safe water supply during a cholera outbreak. The dam was first proposed by the Speaker of the Philippine Assembly, Sergio Osme√±a Sr. Osme√±a then worked hard to obtain support from the Insular Government for various infrastructure projects in Cebu, and one of these was the Buhisan Dam. The American Governor- General William Cameron Forbes supported Osme√±a's proposed project, and helped secure the P550,000 funds for the construction and completion of the Dam. Forbes issued an executive order designating 5,590,000 square meters of land in Labangon for the proposed watershed and reservoir. As early as 1909, American engineer Eusebius Julius Halsema mapped the contours of the entire watershed. The young Halsema (from whom the Halsema Highway was named) was appointed by the Bureau of Public Works to supervise the Cebu waterworks. Marcelo Veloso Regner, an engineer from Cebu, was Halsema's assistant. The dam was then named Osme√±a Waterworks. In order to celebrate this breakthrough, a water fountain was then built, which would now be known as the Fuente Osme√±a Circle, which was also named after the speaker who proposed the waterworks. In 2011, Buhisan Dam celebrated its centennial. In August 2013, there was concern about silting at the dam, which was at risk of overflowing. One source reported that silting had reduced the dam's water capacity from 10,000 cubic meters per day to 6,000 cubic meters per day. After flooding in 2013, safety concerns were raised regarding the dam. MCWD officials state that the dam is stable, but needs to be desilted so it can hold more water. A primitive warning bell, essentially consisting of \\"an oxygen tank and a steel rod to hit it with\\" is being used to alert residents of the barangay of Buhisan to evacuate in the event that rising water levels reach the top of the dam. The endangered \\"Cebu small worm skink\\" (Brachymeles cebuensis) may live near the dam.

Therefore, all SAP applications that are based on SAP NetWeaver can access BRFplus within the boundaries of an SAP system. However, it is also possible to generate web services so that BRFplus rules can also be offered as a service in a SOA landscape, regardless of the software platform used by the service consumers. BRFplus development started as a supporting tool that was part of SAP Business ByDesign, an ERP solution targeted at small and medium size companies. By that time, the tool was called ‚ÄúFormula and Derivation Tool‚Äù (FDT). Later on, it was decided to maintain BRFplus on those codelines that serve as the basis for SAP Business Suite. With that, business rules that have been created for Business ByDesign can easily be taken over in a full- size SAP system where they are ready for use without any changes.  Overview  BRFplus offers a unified modeling and runtime environment for business rules that addresses both technical users (programmers, system administrators) as well as business users who take care of operational business processes (like procurement, bidding, tax form validation, etc.). The different requirements and usage scenarios of the different target groups can be covered with the help of the SAP authorization system and a user interface that can be individually customized. Being integrated into SAP NetWeaver, BRFplus-based applications can look at, and model, business rules from a strictly business- oriented perspective, rather than starting with the underlying technical artifacts. This is because the integration allows for direct access to the business objects available in the SAP dictionary (like customer , supplier, material, bill, etc.). In addition to the predefined expression types (decision table, decision tree, formula, database access, loops, etc.) and actions (sending e-mails, triggering a workflow, etc.), BRFplus can be extended by custom expression types. Also, direct calls of function modules as well as ABAP OO class methods are supported so that the entire range of the ABAP programming language is available for solving business tasks. BRFplus comes with an optional versioning mechanism. Versioning can be switched on and off for individual objects as well as for entire applications. Versioned business rules are needed in certain use cases for legal reasons, but they also allow for simulating the system behavior as it would have been at a particular point in time. Once the rule objects are in a consistent state and active, the system automatically generates ABAP OO classes that encapsulate the functional scope of the underlying rule object. This is done on an on- demand base and speeds up processing. The execution of functions as well as of single expressions can be simulated. The processing log of the simulation is useful for checking the implementation and for investigating problems. BRFplus applications can be exported and imported as an XML file. This is an easy way of creating a data backup. XML files can also be used for deploying rule applications throughout the company.  Main Object Types  = Application = The application object serves as a container for all the BRFplus objects that have been assembled to solve a particular business task. It is possible to define certain default settings on application level that are inherited by all objects that are created in the scope of that application. = Function = A function is used to connect a business application with the rule processing framework of BRFplus. The calling business application passes input values to the function which are then processed by the expressions and rulesets that are associated with the called function. The calculated result is then returned to the calling business application. = Expression types and action types = * Boolean * BRMS Connector * Case * Database Lookup * Decision Table * Decision Tree * Formula * Function Call * Loop * Procedure Call * Random Number * Search Tree * Step Sequence * Value Range1 * XSL Transformation = Ruleset = A ruleset is a container for an arbitrary number of rule objects which in turn carry out the necessary calculations with the help of assigned expressions and actions. Instead of assigning an expression to a function, it is also possible to assign any number of rulesets to a function. When the function is called, all assigned rulesets are subsequently processed. = Data Objects = BRFplus supports elementary data objects (text, number, boolean, time point, amount, quantity) as well as structures and tables. Structures can be nested. For all types of data objects it is possible to reference data objects that reside in the data dictionary of the backend system. With that, a BRFplus data object does not only inherit the type definition of the referenced object but can also access associated data like domain value lists or object documentation. = Other objects = With catalogs, it is possible to define business-specific subsets of the rule objects that reside in the system. This is helpful for hiding the complexity of a rule system, thus improving usability. Object filters are used by system administrators to ensure that for selected users, only a predefined subset of object types is visible. This is useful to enforce access rights as well as modeling policies.  Other BRM solutions offered by SAP  BRFplus is positioned as the successor product of an older business rule solution known as BRF (Business Rule Framework). For a longer transition phase, both solutions exist in parallel. However, an increasing number of SAP applications that used to be based on BRF are constantly migrating to BRFplus. While BRFplus supports business rules for applications based on the SAP NetWeaver ABAP stack, SAP is offering another product named SAP NetWeaver Business Rules Management (BRM). BRM supports business rule modeling for the SAP NetWeaver Java stack. Both products do not compete. They are available in parallel and can be used in a collaborative approach to deal with use cases where both technology stacks are used in parallel. BRFplus comes with a special expression type that helps bridging the gap between the two different technologies.  Availability  BRFplus has been delivered to the public with SAP NetWeaver 7.0 Enhancement Package 1 for the first time. Being part of SAP NetWeaver, the usage of BRFplus is covered by the \\"SAP NetWeaver Foundation for Third Party Applications\\" license, with no additional costs.

The two outer wings contain an Annunciation scene in grisaille. Oil on oak panel, 1437. Gem√§ldegalerie Alte Meister, Dresden. 33.1cm √ó 13.6cm; 33.1cm √ó 27.5cm; 33.1cm √ó 13.6cm Detail of the right panel showing St. Catherine and the inner mouldings of the protective frame The Dresden Triptych (or Virgin and Child with St. Michael and St. Catherine and a Donor, or Triptych of the Virgin and Child) is a very small hinged-triptych altarpiece by the Early Netherlandish painter Jan van Eyck. It consists of five individual panel paintings: a central inner panel, and two double-sided wings. It is signed and dated 1437, and in the permanent collection of the Gem√§ldegalerie Alte Meister, Dresden, with the panels still in their original frames. The only extant triptych attributed to van Eyck, and the only non- portrait signed with his personal motto, ALC IXH XAN (\\"I Do as I Can\\").The words \\"As I Can\\" are a play on his name. Their spelling varies between examples, usually translated as Als ich can. See Dhanens (1980), 188, 385 the triptych can be placed at the midpoint of his known works. It echoes a number of the motifs of his earlier works while marking an advancement in his ability in handling depth of space, and establishes iconographic elements of Marian portraiture that were to become widespread by the latter half of the 15th century. Elisabeth Dhanens describes it as \\"the most charming, delicate and appealing work by Jan van Eyck that has survived\\".Dhanens (1980), 246 The paintings on the two outer wings become visible when the triptych is closed. They show the Virgin Mary and Archangel Gabriel in an Annunciation scene painted in grisaille, which because of their near-monochrome colouring give the impression that the figures are sculpted. The three inner panels are set in an ecclesiastical interior. In the central inner panel Mary is seated and holds the Christ Child on her lap. On the left hand wing Archangel Michael presents a kneeling donor, while on the right St. Catherine of Alexandria stands reading a prayer book. The interior panels are outlined with two layers of painted bronze frames, inscribed with mostly Latin lettering. The texts are drawn from a variety of sources, in the central frames from biblical descriptions of the assumption, while the inner wings are lined with fragments of prayers dedicated to saints Michael and Catherine. The work may have been intended for private devotion, perhaps as a portable altarpiece for a migrant cleric. That the frames are so richly decorated with Latin inscriptions indicates the donor, whose identity is lost, was highly educated and cultured. Because of a lack of surviving documentary evidence on commissions of 15th century-Northern painting, the identities of donors are often established through evidence gathered by modern art historians. In this work, damaged coats of arms on the borders of the interior wings have been identified with the Giustiniani of Genoa ‚Äì an influential albergo active from 1362 ‚Äì who established trade links with Bruges as early as the mid-14th century. Provenance and attribution The Dresden Triptych was probably in the possession of the Giustiniani family in the mid- to late-15th century. It is mentioned in a May 10, 1597 record of a purchase by Vincenzo Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua, and was then sold with the Gonzaga Collection to Charles I of England in 1627. After Charles's fall and execution, the painting went to Paris and was owned by Eberhard Jabach, the Cologne-based banker and art dealer for Louis XIV and Cardinal Mazarin. A year after Jabach's death in 1695, it passed to the Elector of Saxony, and next appears in a 1754 inventory of the Dresden Collection, attributed to Albrecht D√ºrer, until the German historian Aloys Hirt in 1830 established it as a van Eyck. In the mid-19th century the Dresden catalogues first attribute it to Hubert van Eyck (d. 1426) and a few years later to Jan. Lucca Madonna, c. 1436. St√§delsches Kunstinstitut, Frankfurt Van Eyck signed, dated and added his motto to the central panel, a fact only discovered when the frame was removed in the course of a mid-20th century restoration, and confirmed with the 1959 discovery of the signature which is placed along with the words IOHANNIS DE EYCK ME FECIT ET C[OM]PLEVIT ANNO D[OMINI MCCCCXXXVII.ALC IXH XAN (\\"Jan Van Eyck Made And Completed Me In The Year 1437. As I Can\\"). The word \\"completed\\" (complevit) may suggest the completion date, but as master painters of the era typically had workshops to assist on major works, the wording can be seen as aggressively socially ambitious; perhaps an arrogant master painter indicating his workshop assistants had little material involvement in the panels, and that he was primarily responsible for its design and execution. This view is reinforced by the fact that it is the only non-portrait to contain van Eyck's motto, ALC IXH XAN. Until the discovery of the signature the piece was variously dated to an early piece from the 1420s to his later period in the late 1430s. Because the panels are so definitely attributed they are often used as a touchstone to date van Eyck's other works; there are a number of evident stylistic developments, including the type of stained glass windows and mouldings around the arcades, and his ability at handling perspective, which can be used to determine if other works at least pre-date the triptych.Harbison (1991), 152 The central panel has often been compared to his unsigned and undated Lucca Madonna of c. 1436. That work echoes the central panel of the Dresden triptych in a number of aspects, including the dark green canopy, the figuration and positioning of Mary, her heavily-folded dress, the orange and brown pigments of the floor, the geometric carpet and the wooden carvings. The Lucca Madonna is thought to be a portrait of the artist's much younger wife, Margaret.Harbison (1991), 97 Description The work measures including the frames. Given this miniaturist scale, the triptych probably functioned as a portable devotional piece, or altare portabile. Members of the upper-classes and nobility acquired these through papal dispensation, to use during travel and typically during pilgrimage. Van Eyck's patron and employer Philip the Good owned at least one portable triptych of which fragments survive.Luber (1998), 30 The three inner panels comprise a typical sacra conversazione, a form established in Italy in the latter half of the 14th century with a patron saint presenting the donor, usually kneeling, to an enthroned \\"Deity or Mother of God\\".P√§cht (1999), 81 John Ward believes the rich and complex iconography and symbolic meaning van Eyck employed in his religious panels served to highlight the co-existence the artist saw between the spiritual and material worlds. In his earlier paintings, subtle iconographical features ‚Äì referred to as disguised symbolism ‚Äì are typically woven into the work, as \\"relatively small, in the background, or in the shadow [details]\\".Ward (1994), 11 These elements include the apparition of the Virgin before the donor, whose panel contains carvings that seem to be reflective of events of his life. In his religious panels after 1436, van Eyck's reliance on iconographical or symbolic elements is greatly reduced. Ward speculates the reduced size of the work or the wishes of the commissioner influenced this choice, or he \\"decided that he had exhausted the most interesting possibilities and ... much of his carefully planned symbolism went unappreciated by patrons or by viewers.\\"Ward (1994), 13 According to Jacobs, the work reflects a system of symbolism in so far as heavenly and earthly objects are juxtaposed. This is most evident in the disparity between the monochromatic exterior and vivid inner panels.Jacobs (2012), 80 =Frames= The triptych retains its original frames, which are both ornate and serve to protect the piece from the effects of light and smoke during travel and when in situ.Nash (2008), 239 The inner frames have recessed mouldings and are carved with gilded inscriptions, and the top corners of the two wing panels each bear a carved set of coat of arms. The lettering and phrases in Latin serve a dual purpose. They are decorative, similar to margins in medieval manuscripts, and set the context for the imagery; van Eyck would have expected the viewer to contemplate text and imagery in unison.Smith (2004), 146 Writing about Early Netherlandish triptychs, Jacobs says the inscriptions serve to distinguish and separate between the worldly and spiritual spheres, with the panels showing earthly images while the inscriptions on the frames act as reminder of heavenly influence. The letterings reinforce the duality between the earthly and heavenly, with St. Catherine's a reminder of ascetic piety while the figure herself is depicted in sumptuous garments and jewels.Jacobs (2012), 83 The inscriptions on the central panel are fragments from the Book of Wisdom (7:26 and 7:29), and Ecclesiastes (24: 23‚Äì24).Dhanens (1980), 385The lettering on that panel reads: HEC EST SPECIOSIOR SOLE ET SUPER OMNEM DISPOSTITIONEM STELLARUM LUCI COMPARATA INVENITUR PRIOR. CANDOR EST ENIM LUCIS AETERNAE ET SPECULUM SINE MACULA DEI MAIESTATIS ECT. EGO QUASI VITIS FRUCTIVICAVI SUAVITATEM ODORIS ET FLORES MEI FRUCTIS HONORIS ET HONESTATIS. ECO MATER PULCHARAE DILECTIONIS ET TIMORIS ET MAGNITUDINES ET SANCTAE SPEI (\\"She is more beautiful than the sun and above the whole order of the stars. Being compared with the light of day, she is found to excel. For she is the brightness of eternal light, and the flawless mirror of God's majesty. As a vine I have brought forth a pleasant fragrance, and my flowers are the fruit of honour and probity. I am the mother of fair love, and of fear, and of greatness, and of holy hope\\"). see Dhanens (1980), 385; Heath (2008), 110 Those on the wing panels are taken from texts referring directly to the two saints. =Inner panels= Virgin and Child In the central panel the Virgin and Child are enthroned in a church nave within a columned basilica running on either side.Heath (2008), 106 The columns are painted using a variety of dark red, orange and grey pigments, a colour scheme which Peter Heath describes as lending to a \\"sense of airy silence\\".Heath (2008), 107 The throne is positioned on a dais, before a lavishly detailed oriental carpet lying on a similarly geometrically designed tiled floor. The arms of the canopied throne and the arches to either side contain carved or sculptured figures, including tiny representations of Isaac, and David and Goliath,Dhanens (1980), 248 although art historian Antje Maria Neuner reads this carving as showing Jephthah sacrificing his daughter. Mary wears a richly embroidered and as is typical for van Eyck, voluminous red robe, which effectively serves as a cloth of honour.Purtle, Carol J. Review of \\"The Marian Paintings of Jan van Eyck\\", by Goodgal, Dana. Renaissance Quarterly, Volume 36, No. 4, Winter, 1983. 590‚Äì594 The robe is placed over a blue square-cut underdress edged with a jewelled border. In van Eyck's Marian paintings, he almost always clothes her in red writes P√§cht, which makes her seem to dominate the space. The Christ Child is naked and holds towards the donor a banderole adorned with a phrase from the Gospel of Matthew (11:29), DISCITE A ME, QUIA MITIS SUM ET HUMILIS CORDE (\\"Learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart\\"). Detail showing the Virgin and Child sitting on the canopied throne with multi-coloured marble columns to the left Mary's presence in the church is symbolic; she and the child occupy the area where the altar would normally be situated.Borchert (2008), 56 Like van Eyck's two other late Madonna portraits (Virgin and Child with Canon van der Paele of 1436 and Madonna in the Church of c. 1438‚Äì40), Mary is unrealistically large and out of proportion to her surroundings. This reflects the influence of 12th- and 13th-century Italian artists such as Cimabue and Giotto, who in turn drew on the tradition of monumental depictions of Mary from Byzantine icons. According to Lorne Campbell, Mary is presented as if about to \\"rise from her throne and advance into the same plane as St. Michael and St. Catherine, she would tower above them and also above the columns of the church.\\" This idea is in keeping with van Eyck's tendency in such portraits to present Mary as if she was an apparition materialising before the donor in response to his prayer and devotion.Nash (2008), 283 Van Eyck's Mary is here monumental, but less overwhelmingly large than in 13th century works. She is disproportionate to the architecture in her panel, but approximately proportional to the figures in the wings. This restraint evidences the beginning of van Eyck's mature phase, most evidently seen in the composition's \\"greater spatial depth\\".P√§cht (1999), 82 Christ's pose closely follows that of the Paele Madonna; his body still leans towards the donor but here his head faces the viewer more directly.P√§cht (1999), 84 Saints and donor wings St. Catherine and the Archangel Michael occupy the right and left hand panels respectively. They appear to stand in either the aislesCampbell (2004), 23 or ambulatories, and a few bays to the fore compared to the central panel. Their depictions are in keeping with the artist's evolving style: the aisles convey spaciousness, especially by the implied spaces out of view, while both saints subtly lean close to Mary. The use of perspective makes the saints appear small; according to P√§cht they are \\"less solid than the massive figures in the Paele Madonna. It was this Gothic daintiness that led many scholars ... to place this among Jan van Eyck's early work\\".P√§cht (1999), 83 The two side panels are filled with light streaming through the windows that reflects off the saints' accoutrements, glinting from St. Michael's armour and St. Catherine's bejewelled steel sword. Detail showing a crowned St. Catherine. She can be identified through the various hagiographical objects around her. On the right panel St. Catherine is presented as almost the essence of a gothic princess. She stands reading a book in \\"ravishing modesty\\", with unbound blonde hair, which is topped with an elaborate jewelled crown very similar to that in the Madonna of Chancellor Rolin, combined with her rich blue gown and tabard of white draped ermine showing her as the princess she was. A golden chain with a jewelled pendant hangs from her neck. The attributes associated with her are included in her depiction. In her right hand, she holds the sword used for her beheading and at her feet lies the breaking wheel on which she was tortured.Dhanens (1980), 250 Like the woman in van Eyck's Arnolfini Portrait she is \\"fashionably pear-shaped\\"; Heath describes her attire as \\"more dazzling than the Virgin's\\", mirroring St. Michael's splendid armour on the opposite panel.Heath (2008), 112 St. Catherine's presence can be attributed to a number of factors. At that period her reputation and popularity were second to Mary's; she was both an educated and an outspoken woman during her lifetime ‚Äì characteristics that perhaps mirrored the donor's. She is absorbed in her book in a contemplative manner, which might be reflective of a donor with a similar temperament. The frame of her wing is inscribed with the words VIRGO PRUDENS ANELAVIT, GRANUM SIBI RESERVAVIT, VENTILANDO PALEAM. DISIPLINUS EST IMBUTA PUELLA COELESTIBUS, NUDA NUDUM EST SECUTA CHRISTUM PASSIBUS, DUM MUNDANIS EST EXUTA ECT (\\"The prudent virgin has longed for the starry throne where she has made her place ready; leaving the world's threshing floor, she saved the grain for herself by winnowing the chaff. The young girl has been steeped in heavenly learning. Stripped of everything, with sure footsteps she followed Christ until she was delivered from earthly affairs\\"). Detail of the Archangel Michael presenting the donor. Note the two faux bronze painted frames. A landscape can be seen through the window behind St. Catherine. Because of the miniature scale of the painting it can be seen only at close up. The view is built with extremely fine brushwork and shows a number of highly detailed buildingsBorchert (2008), 60 and hills before snowcapped mountains. A lance rests against the shoulder of a youthful-looking St. Michael.Dhanens (1980), 368 Michael is dressed in elaborately jewelled and coloured armour, his left arm holding his helmet,Weale (1903), 29 while his right hand rests on the shoulder of the donor as he is presented to Mary. The donor kneels in prayer before the Virgin, with his hands held upwards as if in prayer, although they are not clasped. He wears a gold ring on his right small finger, and is dressed in a long olive-green houppelande, at the time the height of fashion and an indicator of status within the Burgundian court. The gown has a fur- lined high collar and deep baggy sleeves, also lined with fur. The donor's bowl-shaped haircut, rounded at the fringe but cut above his ears, is also typical of mid-1430s Netherlandish fashion. Except for the red hood, the garment closely resembles that worn by the groom in the Arnolfini Portrait. The capital of the pillar above the donor's head is lined with carvings of military scenes. Similar carvings are seen near the donor in van Eyck's earlier van der Paele and Madonna of Chancellor Rolin, and where they depict events or personal circumstances from the donor's life. Those in the present work likely serve a similar role, however because the donor is unidentified it is unknown as to what they may refer.Teasdale-Smith (1981), 274 Elisabeth Dhanens speculates that they might depict the sarcophagus of Hippolytus in Pisa, which she believes adds credibility to the belief the donor was of Italian origin; she also notes the military scene reflects St. Michael's status as military commander.Dhanens (1980), 248‚Äì249 Ward compares the carving to a similar one found in the Washington Annunciation. Unlike in van Eyck's earlier votive portraits the donor is positioned at a remove from the Marian apparition, and at a much smaller scale to Mary on a triptych wing.Harbison (1991), 61 The lettering running along the edges of the panel's frame consists of a prayer fragment from the liturgy for the feast of St. Michael. The extract reads HIC EST ARCHANGELUS PRINCEPS MILITAE ANGELORUM CUIUS HONOR PRAESTAT BENEFICIA POPULORUM ET ORATARIO PERDUCIT AD REGNA COELORUM. HIC ANGELUS MICHAEL DEI NUNTIUS DE ANIMABUS JUSTIS. GRATIA DEI ILLE VICTOR IN COELIS RESEDIT. A PACIBUS (\\"This is Michael the Archangel, leader of the angelic hosts, whose privilege it is to grant favours to the people, and whose prayer leads them to the Kingdom of Heaven. The Archangel Michael is God's messenger for the souls of the just. By the grace of God, that great victor has taken his place in Heaven, on the side of peace'\\").Heath (2008), 110 =Outer panels= The closed view shows an Annunciation, with imitation statues of the Archangel Gabriel and Mary. When the triptych is closed, the outer wings reveal an Annunciation scene with the Archangel Gabriel and Mary painted in grisaille. The figures form an illusionistic imitation of sculpture, a conceit which van Eyck extends by placing them on octagonal pedestals. The figures are illuminated by light from the left, a device van Eyck often used to imply the presence of God. A dove, representing the Holy Spirit, hovers above Mary. Because the dove is also in grisaille but not attached to a pedestal and apparently floating unfixed above the saints, its presence serves to highlight that the viewer is not looking at sculpture but at a painted representation of sculpture.Jacobs (2012), 63 The annunciation dominates any other theme on the outer wings of Northern 15th-century polyptychs. The tradition originates from Byzantine art, with van Eyck largely responsible for re-popularising the practice.Jacobs (2012) 64 Along with his Ghent Altarpiece, the Dresden Triptych is one of the earliest surviving examples of the technique, and on this basis he is usually credited as the innovator of a motif that became almost standard from the mid-15th century.Jacobs (2012), 63‚Äì64 As the annunciation marks the incarnation of Christ, its representation on the outer wings gives symmetry to the scenes of his life typically detailed on the inner panels.Harbison (1995), 55 Outer wings of Hugo van der Goes's Portinari Altarpiece, c. 1475. Galleria degli Uffizi, Florence. Van der Goes closely follows the convention established by van Eyck, although he omits the octagonal pedestals typical of actual sculpture. The outer wings of 15th-century diptychs and triptychs typically contained Annunciation scenes painted in grisaille. Molly Teasdale Smith believes the practice echoes the tradition of covering religious imagery with grey cloth during the then-46-day lenten period leading up to Easter. There is a symmetry with this in how polyptychs were typically kept closed except for Sundays or church holidays, when they were opened to reveal the more colourful and expansive inner panels.Harbison (1995), 54‚Äì55 According to Dhanens, the sculptural depictions on the outer panels are a \\"brilliant success ... in imparting a sense of life to the supposed statues.\\" The wings continue van Eyck's innovation in placing two grisaille outer panels wings of polyptychs; the earliest extant example being the Annunciation wings of the Ghent Altarpiece.Ward (1975), 209 Architecture The depicted church is of a Romanesque style with Gothic elements. There are pointed canopies above Mary, and the nave is narrow, barely wide enough to contain her. It is walled by a colonnade joined by entablatures and capped with rounded arches. The columns are variously of pink, red and purple marble. Each of the capitals is decorated with faux carvings, some showing representations of the twelve apostles under a small baldachin. The vaulting is visible in the aisles but not in the central nave. There are a number of implied spaces not visible to the viewer. The central panel contains two on either side of the pillars, others lead from the balcony above the throne, and there are unseen exits to hallways at the rear of the two wing panels.Harbison (1991), 151 The east facing windows in the right hand wing resemble those in van Eyck's Rolin Madonna. The centre panel's spatial depth marks an advancement in van Eyck's technique, especially when compared to his similar 1436 ' or van der Paele panel, both of which are comparatively flat. The depth of space is accomplished through such devices as placing the Virgin at the far end of the pictorial space, making her appear both smaller and seemingly at a remove and accentuating the receding lines of the carpets by setting them against the parallels of the folds of her gown. The recessional perspective is further achieved by the sequence of columns stretching back from the throne. This is particularly noticeable with the positioning of the throne in comparison to the Lucca Madonna and van der Paele panels. As with van Eyck's earlier paintings of interiors, the building is not based on a particular place, but is an imagined and idealised formation of what he viewed as a perfect and representational architectural space. This is evidenced by a number of features that would be unlikely in an actual contemporary church such as the sculptures that were more secular in nature. In detailing the structure he pays close attention to contemporary models, which he possibly combined with elements from ancient buildings. The columns contain \\"high prismatic bases\\" found in early churches and on the Arch of Constantine.Wood, Christopher. Forgery, Replica, Fiction: Temporalities of German Renaissance Art. University of Chicago Press, 2008. 195‚Äì96. Craig Harbison believes that because the interior is not based on an actual building, the viewer is not burdened by preconceptions, a device which perhaps opens up the painting's \\"physiological\\" impact. In his view, the panels capture the moment when the donor's prayer and piety is rewarded by an apparition of the Virgin and Child. The novelty and unworldliness of the situation is highlighted by the unrealistic size of the Virgin compared to her surroundings. Light plays a central role in all panels, to an extent almost comparable to van Eyck's Madonna in the Church. The arches and columns are bathed in daylight, echoed by the text of the inscriptions around the central frame allude to light and illumination.Dhanens (1980), 252 Van Eyck pays close attention to the saturating effects and gradations of the light, which enters from the left and spreads across the middle ranges of each panel. He often used light to indicate a divine ethereal presence.Smith (2003), 63 Because the implied spaces found on either side of Mary and leading into each of the wing panels are bathed in this light, they can be seen as conduits for the divine. The triptych influenced Rogier van der Weyden's 1445‚Äì50 Seven Sacraments Altarpiece in a number of aspects, most obviously in its disregard of scale, especially with Mary's size relative to the other figures and surrounding architecture. Van der Weyden develops the idea further, placing a large crucifixion towering above the figures and almost spanning the height of the central panel.  Donor  Detail showing the donor. Unusually his hands are held up but unclasped, suggesting that he is caught in wonder rather than prayer.Dhanens (1980), 249 The identity of the donor has not been established, although a number of suggestions have been advanced over the last 200 years. Harbison suggests the work's small scale indicates that it functioned as a portable altarpiece rather than as a private devotional work, and thus was commissioned by or for a member of the clergy. Other art historians have argued that the donor may have been a Genoese merchant. This belief has been fed by the triptych's similarity to Giovanni Mazone's Virgin and Child altarpiece in Pontremoli, Tuscany, which may place it in the Italian region of Liguria at latest by the end of the 15th century. Damaged coats of arms on the inner framesStreeton, No√´lle L.W. \\"Jan van Eyck's Dresden Triptych: new evidence for the Giustiniani of Genoa in the Borromei ledger for Bruges, 1438\\". Journal of Historians of Netherlandish Art, Volume 3, Issue 1, 2011. have been linked to the Giustiniani family, known for establishing trade links with Bruges in the 14th and 15th centuries. If not commissioned by that family, historical record place the work at least in their possession by the end of the century. In the early 1800s, Frances Weale attempted to place Michele Giustiniani as the donor, however later historical research has been unable to verify his presence in Bruges around 1437, and he seems to have returned to Italy by 1430. Mid-twentieth century technical examination revealed the Giustiniani coats of arms may have been painted over an earlier heraldic design, perhaps as early as the 15th century, whose signifiance and history is now lost. Dhanens theorises that a member of the Giustiniani family may have established other associations with St. Michael and St. Catherine, advancing that they were a member of the Italian Rapondi family,The Rapondis had strong banking ties to the Burgundian dukes and were active in Paris and the Low Countries. See Small, Graham. \\"The City, the Duke and Their Banker: The Rapondi Family and the Formation of the Burgundian State (1384‚Äì1430)\\". The Economic History Review. Volume 60, No. 3 (Aug., 2007), 626‚Äì627 whose trading house in Paris was named after St. Catherine. Their daughter, also named Catherine, married the Italian merchant Michel Burlamacchi (Bollemard in Flemish) from Lucca, who was active in Bruges. From this Dhanens theorises the piece was commissioned as a wedding gift for the couple. Documents show weavers in Wervik paid taxes to Catherine Rapondi and in September 1434, when Michele Burlamacchi was tax collector in that town, van Eyck received a stipend funded by local tax receipts, suggesting a connection. Dhanens admits the donor's identity is lost, but she says of the piece that \\"it could have been a gift from the husband to the wife, a pledge of his affection during his absences; or it could have been a gift from the wife to the husband, by way of protection on his travels.\\"Dhanens (1980), 245 Condition The triptych is in poor condition, having suffered damage and heavy paint loss, and has undergone a number of restorations.Campbell (2006), 139 The outer wooden frames, originally painted in grey and yellow marbling, were later overpainted in a design of black and red in the 16th or 17th centuries when \\"a faux turtle-shell design, imitating the then-fashionable veneer, replaced the earlier scheme of jaspered paint\\". An ebony surround was added to the inner frames for protection in the 1840s. There has been extensive repair work on the paint forming Mary's dress, with large areas of her gown repaired in 1844 by painter Eduard Bendemann. The badly damaged coats of arms have been retouched,Dhanens (1980), 242 while the frames have sustained impairment and are overpainted in areas. The painting was taken to Moscow after the Second World War. It was returned in 1959 after it had been cleaned, restored and underwent examination in a laboratory. This process revealed the ALC IXH XAN inscription on the inner moulding of the central frame in front of the tiled floor when a coat of brown paint was stripped away. The surround was removed during the 1959 restoration. =Notes= =References= =Bibliography= * Blum, Shirley. Early Netherlandish Triptychs: A Study in Patronage.

There are branches in every state and territory, and membership is open to both organisations of any size or type and individuals, both professional and volunteer. History In 1937, the Art Galleries' and Museums' Association of Australia and New Zealand held its inaugural meeting in Auckland. This single organisation represented not-for- profit art galleries and museums in Australia and New Zealand. In 1948, the art galleries dissociated and the resultant Museums Association of Australia covered only science and history museums. Failed attempts to create a single national body were made in the 1960s and 1970s. In 1981, the Council of Australian Museum Associations (CAMA) was formed to foster amalgamation but CAMA was under-resourced for that task until the 1990s. At that time there were three major museums organisations in Australia: the Art Museums Association, the Museums Association and CAMA. The pooling of meagre resources was one impetus towards amalgamation but there was also a pressing need to set uniform standards for museums in relation to artists' moral rights, museum ethics, cultural heritage export restrictions and conservation. In 1993, the executive officer of the Council of Australian Museum Associations, Greg Marginson, authored \\"Amalgamation : unity and diversity : the path towards a united museums' association for Australia\\", which estimated that there were around 1,900 museums in Australia with their professional wants and needs represented by at least 22 different organisations. He reported that Commonwealth and State government funding bodies were confused and frustrated by the lack of a central point of contact with the museum sector and profession.Michael Bogle, \\"Museums need a single voice\\", The Sydney Morning Herald, 20 July 1993, p 19 via factiva accessed 26 August 2011.Greg Marginson, \\"Unity and diversity : the path towards a united museums' association of Australia\\" (1993) Museum National Vol. 2 No. 1 pp 7‚Äì30 At that time there were 12 programs training museum professionals and CAMA saw a need for a single national body to ensure uniform museum studies curriculums and accreditation. On 1 January 1994, Museums Australia was formed by the amalgamation of the Council of Australian Museums Associations, the Museums Association of Australia, the Art Museums Association of Australia, and Museum Education Association of Australia.Des Griffin and Leon Paroissien (2011) 'Museums in Australia: from a new era to a new century\\" in Des Griffin and Leon Paroissien (eds), Understanding Museums: Australian museums and museology, National Museum of Australia accessed 26 August 2011.

Life  dockers Mal√®gue twice took the entrance examination for the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure, in 1900 and 1901. His failure may have been due to poor health. Between 1902 and 1912, during several stays in England, he wrote a doctoral thesis about the high unemployment among casually employed English dockers : Mal√®gue worked principally with Charles Gide. This was published in 1913 as Une forme sp√©ciale de ch√¥mage : le travail casuel dans les ports anglais. Google books In January 1912, during one such stay, he found the whole name of Augustin M√©ridier, the principal character in '. The first handwritten pages of the book date from that month. During the First World War, once more because of his poor health, he was only able to work in an infirmary, despite his repeated attempts to enlist in a fighting unit. In 1917 he worked in the International Commission for relief in London. From 1922 until 1927, he taught at the √âcole Normale, educating teachers for elementary schools of Savenay. In 1923 he married Yvonne Pouzin, a doctor of medicine, and they lived together in Nantes. Mal√®gue's novel Augustin ou le Ma√Ætre est l√† was finished in 1930. The French philosopher Jacques Chevalier, a friend of Mal√®gue, tried unsuccessfully to persuade Plon to publish the work, and in the end Mal√®gue was forced to pay the publisher Spes for the production of the first 3,000 copies . This roman fluvial or roman fleuve of 900 pages immediately had a great success following the French literary critic Claude Barthe. Most French, Belgian, Walloon, and Swiss critics favoured the new novelist and his work, as did the most important literary critics of other countries in Europe, both Catholic and Protestant. Spes printed 10,000 copies at the end of 1933, 9,000 in June 1935, 6,000 in March 1940, and there were further large editions.Jean Lebrec, Joseph Mal√®gue, romancier et penseur, H. Dessain & Toira, Li√®ge, 1969, p. 117: \\"5,000 in February 1942, 5,000 in October 1943, 16,000 in July 1944, 15.000 in February 1947. Since 1953, the book was published in one volume: 5,000 in October 1953; 5,000 in January 1960; 5,000 in January 1966.\\" Mal√®gue was named the Catholic Proust by many French and Walloon literary critics, including Jacques Madaule and L√©opold Levaux. He received many letters and among them communications from Paul Claudel, Henri Bergson, and Maurice Blondel. With this philosopher, he engaged in a philosophical correspondence, which has been studied by Genevi√®ve Mosseray.Genevi√®ve Mosseray, 'Au feu de la critique, J. Mal√®gue lecteur de Blondel' in Les √âcrivains et leurs lectures philosophiques: Le chant de Minerve, publi√© par Bruno Curatolo, L'Harmattan, Paris, 1996 He published P√©nombres in 1939. In 1940, he was found to be suffering from stomach cancer and died in December that year. Despite all his efforts, he was unable to finish . Father interviewing the pope thinks the pope is referring to this second novelAmerica The National Catholic Review Retrieved 21 September 2013. but the pope speaks about holy middle class in order to say that each christian is able to become a saint. And it is also the Mal√®gue's opinion when he writes about holy middle class in Augustin ou Le Ma√Ætre est l√†. Following the sources, it is Father Spadaro who made an error, in his footnote at this place. Mal√®gue used the words Salvation middle classes in the title of his second novel. And therefore, Mal√®gue doesn't mean authentic holy people. The way he means the same idea as the one of the pope is (in Augustin ou Le Ma√Ætre est l√†) : la saintet√© ordinaire (banal holiness). Salvation middle class means the mediocre existence of many Christians who are in favour of the established order which would not bother those who are searching for earthly happiness, to be followed without obstacle by heavenly happiness. This novel, which was more ambitious (almost 1,000 pages already written for the two first parts of the book and there would have been a third part, the most important), was published in 1958 after Mal√®gue's death. Writings Front page of one of the first editions of the novel Mal√®gue's Augustin ou le Ma√Ætre est l√† is unique among Catholic novels, following Victor Brombert,Victor Brombert, The Intellectual Hero. Studies in the French Novel, 1880‚Äì1955, The University of Chicago Press, 1974, p. 223 because, instead of writing about sex and sin as Fran√ßois Mauriac or Georges Bernanos, he poses the religious problem from an intellectual (not intellectualist) point of view. The hero is clearly victim of the libido sciendi. But Mal√®gue insists not on his pride, but on the seduction of the mind. He is not against intelligence, on the contrary. On the contrary a writer as Bernanos is in a sense against intelligence. Victorm Brombert citates L'imposture and the statement Yes intelligence can penetrate everything, just as a light can go through the thickness of crystal, but it is incapable of moving, of embracing. It is a sterile contemplation.Citation of V.Brombert op. cit. French : 'Oui, l'intelligence peut tout traverser, ainsi que la lumi√®re l'√©paisseur du cristal, mais elle est incapable de toucher, ni d'√©treindre. Elle est une contemplation st√©rile' in Georges Bernanos, L'imposture, Plon, Paris 1927, in Le livre de poche, 1965 pp.59-60. The Augustin's return to his faith, in the end of the novel, is not an abdication of the intelligence, but a reconquest through pain and lucidity. This return to faith sharply departs from Jean Barois (of Roger Martin du Gard) because Barois' physical and mental anguish provokes a state of moral depression and a yearning for childhood coziness until in Augustin ou le Ma√Ætre est l√† the return to faith (as in Jean Barois) and suffering is an exalting experience which elevates him [Augustin] to the \\"icy zones of spiritual meditation. Victor Brombert, The intellectual hero, The University of Chicago Press, 1974 p. 226. Reason or intelligence is not abandoned but only cold reason which is unable to meet the person, both of men and God, in the same sense as the philosophers Blaise Pascal or Henri Bergson, thinking that Jewish or Christian God is not the God of Aristotle. But, in doing so, the author wrote a long (900 pages in the first edition) and authentic novel 'without loss of either dramatic or psychological intensity'.Victor Brombert, The Intellectual Hero..., p. 223. Following him, the drama of intelligence appears in a different light in other Catholic novels. If this author is a little forgotten, even in France, some literary critics continue to study his work, and among them William Marceau who wrote in 1987, Henri Bergson and Maurice Mal√®gue, la convergence de deux pens√©es (French and Italian Studies, Stanford University, 1987), or Claude Barthe in 2004. Jean Guitton told that a great reader of Mal√®gue was the pope Paul VI Jean Guitton, Paul VI secret, DDB, Paris, 1980, p. 79. : Le pape ajoute : ¬´ Un de mes amis me racontait que le livre de Mal√®gue l'avait tellement s√©duit qu'il n'avait pas pu dormir de la nuit : il avait pass√© la nuit √† le lire, c'√©tait notre propre histoire de l'√¢me qui y √©tait racont√©e. Mal√®gue a fait un autre livre, sur les saints des classes moyennes. Je ne l'ai pas lu, je suis s√ªr que c'est un tr√®s beau livre ¬ª. Mal√®gue was also appreciated by unbelievers or atheists as for instance Fernand Vand√©rem, a Jewish literary critic for Le Figaro, who wrote articles in the most laudatory terms. Worthy of interest again Since Pope Francis quoted Mal√®gue, a little part of the French public are more aware of his importance, which is the one of a great writer; the press reports on him. The great Mal√®gue's novel Augustin ou Le Ma√Ætre est l√† was published for the last time in 1966. In January 2014, the great publishing house, √âditions du Cerf republished the novel.

From Seoul Cheongrangri KTX station (NE Seoul) as well as Seoul KTX station 1 and half hour KTX Jinbu station newly-opened from Feb. 22, 2017 exclusively-built for PyeongChang 2018. There are purple ski shuttle buses to the resort 3 or 4 times a day. Alpensia has six slopes for skiing and snowboarding, with runs up to long, for beginners and advanced skiers, and an area reserved for snowboarders. While the resort is open year-round, the off-season turns the bottom of the slopes into a wild flower garden estimating 100,000-square meters. When the ski and snowboarding season opens, all runs are serviced by chairlifts and are named: Alpha (beginner), Bravo (beginner/intermediate), Charlie, Delta, Echo and Foxtrot catering for intermediate ability. All slopes are closed between 4:30 pm and 6:30 pm each day for piste-maintenance. Night skiing is available from 6:30 pm to 10 pm. Alpensia is a 5‚Äì10-minute car ride to the more extensive Yongpyong Ski Resort which has a full range of runs.

Description C. nodosa has light green or greyish-green leaves. They are very narrow but may be up to forty centimetres long. Each leaf has seven to nine veins running along its length.

Inconspicuous grass-like flowers are sometimes produced at the end of long stems in the spring when water temperatures begin to rise after their winter minimum. The pollen is liberated into the sea and the seeds remain dormant until the following spring. Distribution and habitat This seagrass is found in shallow parts of the Mediterranean Sea and the adjoining parts of the Atlantic Ocean, the coasts of Portugal, Mauritania and Senegal and round the Canary Islands, Madeira and the island of Cape Verde. It grows at depths of down to nineteen metres in sandy sediments in sheltered locations and needs clear waters for photosynthesis. Off the Catalan coast in the western Mediterranean, a single meadow of this grass covering at least has been discovered. Ecology Cymodocea nodosa grows in meadows on the seabed and is sometimes associated with the other seagrasses, Zostera noltei and Posidonia oceanica and the seaweeds Caulerpa prolifera and Caulerpa racemosa. Although it is adversely affected by mechanical disturbance such as trawling and by pollution, and although it is in competition with other seagrass species, C. nodosa is not considered to be threatened.Cymodocea nodosa IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.

Retrieved 2011-08-17 C. nodosa tends to grow in patches. This is because it favours unstable sandy sediments and subaqueous dunes tend to move over time. If the sand accretion is not too fast, the stolons can grow vertically through it, but the seagrass can be overwhelmed by rapid accretion. Patch death was mostly caused by erosion as roots were uncovered, encrusting and drilling organisms increased and plants were swept away. The dune movement cycle tended to take two to six years, which gives the seagrass time to recolonise bare areas. Sand accretion also stimulates flowering and dormant seeds can enable recolonisation when conditions allow it. The fact that the pattern of C. nodosa growth changes as sand is deposited provides a means of measuring the travel of subaqueous dunes. In the Alfacs Bay in the northwest Mediterranean Sea, it was found that the rate of dune advance averaged 13 metres per year, and that the seagrasses could be used to monitor movement rates ranging from 0.15 metres to 980 metres per year. The invasive alga Caulerpa taxifolia is often associated with C. nodosa. It has an extensive rhizoidal system that anchors it to a sandy substrate. The alga is better able to extract nutrients from the substrate than can the seagrass. A study was undertaken near the island of Elba, Italy, in which slow release fertiliser sticks were added to test plots of the seabed where the seagrass and alga both grew. It was found that although both species responded with increased growth rates, the seagrass was relatively disadvantaged in that increased growth of the alga restricted the amount of sunlight reaching the seagrass whereas the alga was less constrained by limited light.A Pilot Study of Nutrient Enriched Sediments in a Cymodocea nodosa Bed Invaded by the Introduced Alga Caulerpa taxifolia Retrieved 2011-08-17 References External Links * Fotos of Cymodocea nodosa in iNaturalist Cymodoceaceae Biota of the Atlantic Ocean Biota of the Mediterranean Sea Biota of the Adriatic Sea Biota of the Canary Islands Biota of Cape Verde Biota of Madeira Biota of Mauritania Biota of Portugal Biota of Senegal Taxa named by Bernardino da Ucria Taxa named by Paul Friedrich August Ascherson ","title":"Cymodocea nodosa"},{"id":"32797360","text":"H≈Ω series 6112 is a class of low-floor electrical multiple units manufactured by the Croatian company Konƒçar Group, operated by Croatian Railways () and the Railways of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

The prototype made its first test run at the Zagreb ‚Äì Dugo Selo line on July 3, 2011. The construction, design and driving characteristics of the low-floor electric train enable optimized operations and increased traveling comfort in regional passenger traffic in regard to the length of the route. Passenger space is uniform along the entire train, without partitions and stairs. Floor height is optimal for 550 mm high platforms. The train has up to eight doors on each side, which enables the rapid exchange of passengers, and an air-conditioned passenger compartment and driver's cab. The main frame is a four-part welded steel construction linked with joints. The body consists of aluminum sandwich panels and windows. All bogies are equipped with air suspension systems, and two side drive bogies, while three free bogies are of the Jacobs type. Three-phase asynchronous traction motors, fed from an electronic IGBT inverter provide high acceleration at start-up and a maximum speed of 200 km/h. The steering and diagnostic system is a microprocessor system that links the train subsystems with modern communication protocols that allow for linking up to three trains into one.

Transport was available via the Holmenkollen Line. During the 1952 Winter Olympics, the venue was designated as a reserve venue for Bislett, but never used.

Weatherly. The first book, Angel, was first published in the United Kingdom on 1 October 2010 through Usborne Publishing and was later released in the United States as Angel Burn through Candlewick on 24 May 2011. The following two books, Angel Fire and Angel Fever, were also released by Candlewick in the United States and Usborne Publishing in the United Kingdom. Summary In the series angels are beings from another dimension, who crossed over to ours when the ether, their natural food source, started running out. To supplement it, they feed off humans' aura, causing serious long-term illnesses to them. Willow is a sixteen-year-old girl who has psychic powers that tell her (on physical contact) a person's past and all the possible futures of that person; she meets Alex, who is an Angel Killer or an AK who has been sent to her house to kill her. However, when he sees Willow's angel and realizes that it doesn't have a halo, which is the angels energy store for the energy that they take from the humans, he also observes a picture of Willow when she was a child and takes it as proof that Willow's not an angel since angels don't have childhoods. He follows Willow as she goes to Church of Angels to talk one of her friends, who has a severe angel burn, out of joining but the visit sets off a chain of events resulting in all the church of angel members looking for her, eager for her death. Alex tells Willow that while her mother was a human, her father was an angel. They both head toward New Mexico to meet Cully, an old friend of Alex's. On the way, the car breaks down and they need to stop at a motel while the mechanic looks for the correct parts. Alex and Willow go to a restaurant where Willow 'reads' the waitress and stops her from committing suicide by telling her about the bright future which she would have if she didn't kill herself, she also convinces one of her colleagues to keep an eye on her. This action makes Alex trust her a bit. The journey to New Mexico is fairly uneventful apart from the fact that while Willow and Alex fall in love with each other, both are oblivious to the other's feelings. They arrive at camp, where Alex had lived before the Invasion. He tells Willow how his father started the camp and how they used to hunt in groups of four, how a hunt could take over a week. How, when the Invasion occurred, the CIA took over due to the sudden jump in the number of angels and they all had to break any contact with each other, how the angel spotters sent them texts with the addresses of the angels. The camp was seemingly deserted as Alex told Willow about life at camp and he recounted years of pillow fights with his elder brother, Jake. He tells Willow how the angels killed his mother, brother, and father. Just then they hear a truck pulling up and Cully appears. After a while, they both realize that Cully is suffering from an angel burn and they have to fight off five angels with the help of Willow's angel who came out to protect Alex. Alex takes Willow to a hut in the mountains where they finally get together and they remain there for a few months. On Willow's birthday, Alex presents her with a beautiful necklace and encourages her to contact her angel. When Willow does, the Church of Angels uses the energy to pinpoint the location but, a spy leaks the information to the only people in Project Angel without an angel burn and these two people, one human Sophia and one angel Nate who believes that his kind doesn't have the right to feed off another species, come and propose a plan to end the angel problem for once and for all. They say that they need Willow's help as she can be at two places at once and Willow agrees, the plan goes horribly wrong and Nate is killed. Another wave of angels arrives and Willow and Alex Kylar escape. For the rest of the story, you have to read the second book, Angel Fire.

Exhibitions  ZERO, Guggenheim, New York G√ºnther Uecker, Gropiusbau, Berlin =Early shows= In 1959, artists Pol Bury, Paul van Hoeydonck, Jean Tinguely, and Daniel Spoerri organized Motion in Vision ‚Äì Vision in Motion, an exhibition at Hessenhuis in Antwerp that for the first time gave ZERO an international audience. This show was the first major ZERO exhibition, after previous shows held at their studio by Heinz Mack and Piene in 1957. In the early 1960s, the artist Henk Peeters presented the international director of the Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam, Willem Sandberg, with monochromatic works of the young European artists' generation. In a close exchange with Mack, Piene, and G√ºnther Uecker, as well as Yves Klein and Piero Manzoni, the original concept was further developed. This was the result of a 1962 exhibition which, besides monochromy, also concerned itself with color, vibration, light, and movement. There were works by European artists, works from North and South America, as well as from Japan. The exhibition was initiated, organized, and financed by the artists themselves. The selection of the participants took place likewise by the artists, without curatorial assistance. The exhibition was accompanied by a jointly developed catalog. =Retrospective shows= Between 1993 and 1999, four ZERO exhibitions took place at Galerie Villa Merkel in Esslingen, curated by art historian Renate Wiehager. The exhibition series, which was specific to the NUL Group from the Netherlands, ZERO Italy, and ZERO Paris, was ended in 1999 with the exhibition Zero Deutschland 1960. Apart from the three protagonists of the German ZERO movement, Weihager devoted herself to a further twenty artists whose works ranged from the late 1950s to the 1990s. Unlike in the 1960s, this series of exhibitions was not initiated, organized and financed by the artists. A series of four publications was issued, with a first comprehensive overview of ZERO as a European movement in four languages: German, English, Dutch, and French. In 2006, the Museum Kunstpalast in D√ºsseldorf presented an overview exhibition of the international ZERO movement, with paintings and installations from many countries. Mack, Piene, and Uecker curated their own areas. Jean-Hubert Martin and Mattijs Visser organized the exhibit, with input from Henk Peeters. The exhibition covered several aspects of the exhibitions from the Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam in the form of reconstructions of former installations. Also in 2006, the Museum der Moderne Salzburg presented 120 works by 50 Zero artists.Mariana Schroeder (May 19, 2006),Gauging the Impact of Zero Wall Street Journal. The works were loaned by the German collectors Gerhard and Anna Lenz, who had been involved with the Zero movement almost from its beginnings. Gerhard had first encountered the Zero group at an exhibition of Piene‚Äôs work in a D√ºsseldorf bookshop more in 1963. Starting in 1974, the couple exhibited the collection in 12 shows over 25 years, including in Frankfurt, Barcelona, Moscow, and Warsaw.Catherine Hickley (January 20, 2010), Klein, Fontana Collectors Lenz to Auction $19.5 Million of Art Bloomberg.

In 2015, an exhibition titled ZERO: Countdown to the Future was on display at the Multimedia Museum in Moscow, and in Sakƒ±p Sabancƒ± Museum in Istanbul, Turkey. Later that year, the Guggenheim Museum showcased the group‚Äôs work in ZERO: Countdown to Tomorrow, 1950s-60s, an exhibition that featured more than 40 artists from over 10 countries. This was the first large-scale historical survey of the group's work in the United States. The exhibition was initiated by the ZERO foundation. In 2015 and 2016, this exhibit toured to the Martin- Gropius-Bau in Berlin and the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam. Various subjects ‚Äì articulated in time, space, color, reflection, vibration, light, and movement ‚Äì showed works of art from the central years of the ZERO movement from 1957 to 1967. With around 40 artists, the exhibition followed the ZERO spirit, from two-dimensional paintings to the three-dimensional space. At the Martin-Gropius-Bau, artists from Germany, Italy, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Venezuela, Switzerland, Japan, the US, and Brazil were represented with around 200 works and ten space-filling installations. Among them were some rare works from renowned collections such as the Georges Pompidou Center, the Morsbroich Museum, the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam, and the Museum of Fine Arts in D√ºsseldorf. In addition, for the first time, works by several artists were shown: Manzoni, Verheyen, Fontana, Tinguely, Klein, Mack, and Piene. The highlight of the collaboration was the space-saving historical installation Lichtraum (Hommage √† Fontana) by Mack, Piene, and Uecker, which was presented for the first time at the documenta III 1964. Mack presented an installation as an homage to his ZERO friends. Exhibitions and events were documented using previously unpublished photos and videos. In 2018, the Museum of Old and New Art in Hobart Tasmania organized a large show around the theme of \\"Vibration\\", with historical old and reconstructed installations, the first time that ZERO shows on the other side of the world. The exhibition included large installations by Enrico Castellani, Gianni Colombo, Mack, Peeters, Piene, Jes√∫s Rafael Soto, Tinguely, and Uecker. A separate section was, for the first time in a ZERO show, dedicated to \\"father figures\\" of the movement: Victor Vasarely, Marcel Duchamp, and Lucio Fontana.

The founding artists donated numerous works and their archives from the ZERO period, including photographs, correspondence, posters, invitations, press articles, and magazines. Additional works and documents were collected and shared through exhibitions and publications. These efforts include both the initial period (1958-1966) and the continuing impact of the work. The foundation's archive and library are available for research purposes. The living artists whose work it covers are actively involved in its work, an continue to share first-hand information about the ZERO era. = Other research = Visser went on to found the 0-Institute, focused on presenting the works and documents of international artists associated with ZERO, in a contemporary context.

The band consists of Ed Alston (lead vocals and guitar), George Kirchner (lead guitar and vocals), Jack Goldsmith (bass guitar and backing vocals) and Keir Adamson (drums and backing vocals). They were signed by LUMI Records in 2011 prior to the release of their debut album, That's What She Said. The band's name originates from the American drink, Fuze. Their debut single, Hey You, was used in the soundtrack for the UK film, The Shouting Men, which featured Craig Fairbrass, Warren Llambias, John Barnes and Matt Daniel-Baker. Their second single, When You Come Home, was released in July 2011. Fuze were crowned Chelmsford's YFest winners in August 2011 after return from their tour of England. The band are believed to have finished writing for their second album, which is due for release in 2012. History =2008-2010: Early years= Fuze after winning YFest 2011 Prior to Fuze, in 2008 George Kirchner invited Jack Goldsmith, who lived just four doors away, to join his band Blue Faze Fuze. After a load of gigs and three different drummers, in 2009 Jack Goldsmith was introduced by his brother-in-law to Keir Adamson who just by chance happened to attend Trinity Catholic High School, the same school that George had attended. George auditioned Keir during the school lunch hour and it was not only Keir's drumming ability that impressed George, but also his sense of humour and like- ability. Keir officially joined Fuze in November 2009 and was thrown straight into the deep end by playing fifteen gigs in the space of two months. In January 2010, Fuze started auditioning for a new front man however, nobody really caught their eye. It was later that year in April, when George Kirchner came across an acoustic cover of Supermassive black hole on YouTube by Ed Alston. George emailed Ed and invited him to come along to their next gig, however due to Ed living in Chelmsford, he found traveling to London a problem. It wasn't until May, when Fuze played at The Box in Chelmsford, when Ed eventually came to a gig. After liking what he saw, Ed joined the band a week later. The band released their first EP, named \\"It's An EP Fool!\\", in June 2010. The EP was recorded live in studio 7K, and included songs, \\"Lies\\", \\"Don't Cry\\", \\"Waste My Time\\" and \\"Changed Ways\\". The EP was played by many local radio stations and led to new gigs at venues the band had not played before. Fuze also posted a couple of video blogs on YouTube to gain popularity and more hits on their MySpace page.

There are also sources indicating the export of slaves from the Aksumite Kingdom (100‚Äì940 AD). The practice formed an integral part of Ethiopian society, from its earliest days and well in to the 20th century so much so even Ethiopian rulers, including those who did not approve of the institution, such as Emperor Menelik II (1889-1913) and Emperor Haile Selassie (Ethiopia‚Äôs regent, 1916-1930 and Emperor of Ethiopia, 1930-1974), are said to have owned slaves by the thousands (Pankhurst, 1968, p. 75.). Slaves were traditionally drawn from groups inhabiting Ethiopia's southern hinterland as well as the Omotic groups. War captives were another source of slaves, though the perception, treatment and duties of these prisoners was markedly different. One of the first written laws to regulate slavery in the Ethiopian region was The Fetha Nagast (The Law of the Kings), a traditional law for Ethiopian Orthodox Christians. Under this law, one category of people that could legally be enslaved was prisoners of war. It declared: ¬∑ t]he state of] Liberty is in accord with the law of reason, for all men share liberty on the basis of natural law. But war and the strength of horses bring some to the service of others, because the law of war and of victory makes the vanquished slaves of the victors[3] The law also provided for the enslavement of non-believers and the children of slaves. Slavery could also be imposed as a punishment for committing certain crimes, also known as ‚Äúpunitive enslavement.‚Äù Emperor Menilek‚Äôs 1899 decree mandating the enslavement of thieves and people who sold slaves in violation of his ban is a good example of this form of enslavement. Emperor Tewodros II (1855-1869) and Emperor Yohannes IV ( 1872-1889) both attempted to end slavery in 1854 and 1884 respectively. Emperor Menelik II was no different in his aversion to the institution of slavery, although he was not always consistent in his actions. In 1876 he issued a proclamation in which he prohibited Christians from buying and selling slaves in his territories and mandated that any Muslim caught traveling with slaves should be taken into custody and tried. (Pankhurst, 1968, p. 100.) This law was ineffective, in part because Menelik himself violated its terms by, among other things, continuing to levy taxes from slave markets. Upon his ascent to the throne in 1889, he again issued a decree abolishing slavery. (Encyclopaedia Aethiopica 680.) However, he made an exception for prisoners of war and he used this exception to enslave war captives by the thousands. As noted above, he also used slavery and enslavement as a tool for punishing certain criminals. Some may argue his attempt of the abolition of slavery was first implemented in 1910 with a letter to Abba Jifar, ruler of Jimma at the time, was thought to have sold slaves to the Arab slave traders. The abolition of slavery as far as a modern written constitution became a high priority for the Haile Selassie government in 1942. The abolishment of slavery was put into law during the Italian occupation period with the issue of two laws in October 1935 and April 1936. Emperor Haile Selassie put this in a written constitution in 1942. After the Italians were expelled Ethiopia officially abolished slavery and involuntary servitude, by making it a law on 26 August 1942. Overview Slavery was fundamental to the social, political and economic order of medieval Ethiopia. Racism in the territory was traditionally mainly directed at ethnic minorities, as well as other individuals from the south of the country. Collectively, these groups are locally known as barya, derogatory terms originally denoting slave descent, irrespective of the individual's family history. Slaves in Ethiopia, 19th century. According to Henry Salt, the Abyssinian highlanders also actively hunted the Shanqella during the 19th century. Following the abolition of the slave trade in the 1940s, the freed Shanqella and barya were typically employed as unskilled labour. Traditionally, racism against perceived barya transcended class and remained in effect regardless of social position or parentage. Although other populations in Ethiopia also faced varying degrees of discrimination, little of that adversity was by contrast on account of racial differences. It was instead more typically rooted in disparities in class and competition for economic status. The Oromo for example, not considered by the highlander groups as being racially barya, owing to their similar physical features. History =Background= In Ethiopia, slavery was legal and widespread; slave raiding was endemic in some areas, and slave trading was a way of life. The largest slavery-driven polity in the Horn of Africa before the nineteenth century was the Ethiopian Empire. Though its intercontinental slave trade was substantial, the Ethiopian Highlands were the largest consumer of slaves in the region. Before the imperial expansion to the south Asandabo, Saqa, Hermata and Bonga were the primary slave markets for the kingdom of Guduru, Limmu- Enaria, Jimma and Kaffa.W. G. Clarence-Smith The Economics of the Indian Ocean Slave Trade in the Nineteenth Century. Psychology Press (1989) pp. 108 Google Books The merchant villages adjacent to these major markets of southwestern Ethiopia were invariably full of slaves, which the upper classes exchanged for the imported goods they coveted. The slaves were walked to the large distribution markets like Basso in Gojjam, Aliyu Amba and Abdul Resul in Shewa.Harold G. Marcus A History of Ethiopia. University of California Press (1994) pp. 55 Google Books The primary source of slaves for the southern territories was the continuous wars & raids between various clans and tribes which has been going on for thousands of years, and it usually follows with large scale slavery that was very common during the battles of that era.W.

Famine was another source of slaves, and during times of recurrent drought and widespread cattle disease, slave markets throughout the country will be flooded with victims of famine. For instance, the Great Famine of 1890-91 forced many people from the Christian north as well as southern Ethiopia to even sell their children and, at times, themselves to Muslim merchants.Gwyn Campbell, Suzanne Miers, Joseph Calder Miller Women and Slavery: Africa, the Indian Ocean world, and the medieval north Atlantic, Volume 1.

This was largely in retaliation for the 16th century Oromo Expansion as well as the Zemene Mesafint (\\"Era of the Princes\\"), a period during which a succession of Oromo feudal rulers dominated the highlanders.

According to Donald, indeed a large part of the increased slave trade in the first half of the nineteenth century consisted of captives being sold by other neighbouring clans and tribes in the south & in Oromo areas.Donald N. Levine Greater Ethiopia: The Evolution of a Multiethnic Society. University of Chicago Press (2000) pp. 156 Google Books The nineteenth century witnessed an unprecedented growth in slavery in the country, especially in southern Oromo towns, which expanded as the influx of slaves grew. In the Christian highlands, especially in the province of Shoa, the number of slaves was quite large by the mid- century. However, despite the war raids, the Oromo were not considered by the highlander groups as being racially barya, owing to their common Afro-Asiatic ancestry. =Arab slave trade= Historical routes of the Ethiopian slave trade. The Indian Ocean slave trade was multi-directional and changed over time. To meet the demand for menial labor, slaves sold to Muslim slave traders by local slave raiders, Ethiopian chiefs and kings from the interior, were sold over the centuries to customers in Egypt, the Arabian peninsula, the Persian Gulf, India, the Far East, the Indian Ocean islands, Somalia and Ethiopia.Gwyn Campbell, The Structure of Slavery in Indian Ocean Africa and Asia, 1 edition, (Routledge: 2003), p.ix During the second half of the 19th century and early 20th century, slaves shipped from Ethiopia had a high demand in the markets of the Arabian peninsula and elsewhere in the Middle East. They were mostly domestic servants, though some served as agricultural labourers, or as water carriers, herdsmen, seamen, camel drivers, porters, washerwomen, masons, shop assistants and cooks. The most fortunate of the men worked as the officials or bodyguards of the ruler and emirs, or as business managers for rich merchants. They enjoyed significant personal freedom and occasionally held slaves of their own. Besides Javanese and Chinese girls brought in from the Far East, young Ethiopian females were among the most valued concubines. The most beautiful ones often enjoyed a wealthy lifestyle, and became mistresses of the elite or even mothers to rulers. The principal sources of these slaves, all of whom passed through Matamma, Massawa and Tadjoura on the Red Sea, were the southwestern parts of Ethiopia, in the Oromo and Sidama country. The most important outlet for Ethiopian slaves was undoubtedly Massawa. Trade routes from Gondar, located in the Ethiopian Highlands led to Massawa via Adwa. Slave drivers from Gondar took 100-200 slaves in a single trip to Massawa, the majority of whom were female. A small number of eunuchs were also acquired by the slave traders in the southern parts of Ethiopia. Mainly consisting of young children, they led the most privileged lives and commanded the highest prices in the Islamic global markets because of their rarity. They served in the harems of the affluent or guarded holy sites. Some of the young boys had become eunuchs due to the battle traditions that were at the time endemic to Arsi and Borena of southern Ethiopia. However, the majority came from the Badi Folia principality in the Jimma region, situated to the southeast of Enarea. The local Oromo rulers were so disturbed by the custom that they had driven out all of those in their kingdoms who practiced it. =Successful abolition= The abolition of slavery became a high priority for the Haile Selassie regime which began in 1930.Christine Whyte, \\"‚ÄòEveryone Knows that Laws Bring the Greatest Benefits to Mankind‚Äô: The Global and Local Origins of Anti-Slavery in Abyssinia, 1880‚Äì1942.\\" Slavery & Abolition 35.4 (2014): 652-669. His policy was to announce abolition while gradually implementing it to avoid disrupting the rural economy.Sterling Joseph Coleman Jr, \\"Gradual Abolition or Immediate Abolition of Slavery? The Political, Social and Economic Quandary of Emperor Haile Selassie I.\\" Slavery and Abolition 29.1 (2008): 65-82. The main international pressure was mobilized by Great Britain, working through the League of Nations, which required it for membership.Suzanne Miers, \\"Britain and the Suppression of Slavery in Ethiopia.\\" Slavery and Abolition 18.3 (1997): 257-288. Under the pretense of abolishing slavery (and a border incident), Italy invaded Ethiopia in 1935. Italy ignored international condemnation and demands by the League of Nations to depart. During Italian rule, the occupation government issued two laws in October 1935 and in April 1936 which theoretically freed 420,000 people. After the Italians were expelled, Emperor Haile Selassie returned to power and quickly abolished the actual practice in 1942.Hanibal Goitom, \\"Abolition of Slavery in Ethiopia\\" On Custodia Legis: Law Librarians of Congress February 14, 2012 Nature and characteristics Slavery, as practiced within Ethiopia, differed depending on the class of slaves in question. The \\"Tiqur \\" (literally \\"black,\\" with the connotation of 'dark-skinned') Shanqalla slaves in general sold for cheap. They were also mainly assigned hard work in the house and field. On the other hand, the \\"Qay \\" (literally \\"red,\\" with the connotation of 'light-skinned') Oromo and Sidama slaves had a much higher value and were carefully sorted according to occupation and age: Very young children up to the age of ten were referred to as Mamul. Their price was slightly lower than that of ten- to sixteen-year-old boys. Known as Gurbe, the latter young males were destined for training as personal servants. Men in their twenties were called Kadama. Since they were deemed beyond the age of training, they sold for a slightly lower price than the Gurbe. A male's value thus decreased with age. The most esteemed and desired females were girls in their teens, who were called Wosif. The most attractive among them were destined to become wives and concubines. Older women were appraised in accordance with their ability to perform household chores as well as their strength. Abolition efforts 1850-1942 Initial efforts to abolish slavery in Ethiopia go as far back as the early 1850s, when Emperor Tewodros II outlawed the slave trade in his domain, albeit without much effect. Only the presence of the British in the Red Sea resulted in any real pressure on the trade. Both Emperor Tewodros II and Emperor Yohannes IV also outlawed slavery but since all tribes were not against slavery and the fact that the country was surrounded on all sides by slave raiders and traders, it was not possible to entirely suppress this practice even by the 20th century.Jean Allain The Law and Slavery: Prohibiting Human Exploitation (2015) pp. 128 Google Books By the mid-1890s, Menelik was actively suppressing the trade, destroying notorious slave market towns and punishing slavers with amputation.Raymond Jonas The Battle of Adwa: African Victory in the Age of Empire (2011) pp. 81 Google Books According to Chris Prouty, Menelik prohibited slavery while it was beyond his capacity to change the mind of his people regarding this age-old practice, that was widely prevalent throughout the country.Chris Prouty Empress Taytu and Menilek II: Ethiopia, 1883-1910. Ravens Educational & Development Services (1986) pp. 16 Google Books To gain international recognition for his nation, Haile Selassie formally applied to join the League of Nations in 1919. Ethiopia's admission was initially rejected due to concerns about its slave-holding, slave trade and arms trade. Italy and Great Britain led the opposition, implying that independent Ethiopia was not yet civilised enough to join an international organization of free nations. It was eventually admitted in 1923, after signing the Convention of St. Germain to suppress slavery. The League later appointed the Temporary Slavery Commission in 1924 to inquire into slavery worldwide. Despite the apparent measures to the contrary, slavery continued to be legal in Ethiopia even with its signing of the Slavery Convention of 1926. Legacy Although slavery was abolished in the 1940s, the effects of Ethiopia's longstanding peculiar institution lingered. As a result, former President of Ethiopia Mengistu Haile Mariam was virtually absent from the country's controlled press in the first few weeks of his seizure of power. He also consciously avoided making public appearances, here too on the belief that his appearance would not sit well with the country's deposed political elite, particularly the Amhara. By contrast, Mengistu's rise to prominence was hailed by the southern Shanqella groups as a personal victory. Ethnic discrimination against the 'barya' or Shanqella communities in Ethiopia still exists, affecting access to political and social opportunities and resources. Some slaves of Ethiopia or their descendants have also held the highest positions. Abraha, the 6th century South Arabian ruler who led an army of 70,000, whom was appointed by the Axumites was a slave of a Byzantine Merchant in the Ethiopian port of Adulis.J.A.

This tradition is usually dated to 1098 in origin. The term Cistercian is derived from Cistercium,The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, 3rd ed., 1992. the Latin name for the village of C√Æteaux, near Dijon in eastern France. It was in this village that a group of Benedictine monks from the monastery of Molesme founded C√Æteaux Abbey in 1098, with the goal of following more closely the Rule of Saint Benedict. Monks following this Rule are known as Benedictine, and were at that time the dominant force in Christian monasticism. The monks of C√Æteaux Abbey effectively founded a new order (the Cistercians), but one that remains closely associated with the Benedictine Order. As a mark of their distinctive charism and rule, Cistercian monks have long worn white habits, to distinguish themselves from Benedictine monks, who wear black habits. Within Anglicanism there has historically been less interest in the Cistercian Order than certain other monastic Rules, although Cistercian life has been represented continuously in the Church of England since at least 1966. Anglican Cistercian history =Influence at and beyond the English Reformation= The pre-reformation English Church (which included Wales) boasted a number of notable and influential Cistercian abbeys, including Waverley Abbey (Surrey), Rievaulx Abbey (Yorkshire), Fountains Abbey (Yorkshire), and Tintern Abbey (Monmouthshire). All were closed as part of the Dissolution of the Monasteries by Henry VIII, but their history remains significant, and Fountains Abbey is a UNESCO world heritage site. The life of the Cistercian Order in England included a strong work ethic, and the Order was largely responsible for the development of the wool trade, which itself became the backbone of a developing English commercial prosperity. The commercial influence of the Cistercian Order appears to have carried over into the post-reformation era, and the early decades of an independent English Church which represents the roots of Anglicanism. A 2016 study concluded that \\"English counties that were more exposed to Cistercian monasteries experienced faster productivity growth from the 13th century onwards\\" and that this influence carried over beyond the dissolution of the monasteries in the 1530s. It has been suggested that the Order‚Äôs lifestyle and pursuit of wealth were early manifestations of ‚Äúthe Protestant work ethic‚Äù, as manifested in the formative years of Anglicanism as a distinct branch of western Christendom. =Victorian English monastic revival= The revival of religious communities within the Anglican Communion during the 18th century, and more especially the nineteenth and twentieth centuries under the influence of the Oxford Movement, saw the revival of many of the traditional monastic rules, particularly those of the Benedictine, Franciscan and Augustinian orders. However, there were few attempts to revive the Cistercian Rule within the Anglican communion prior to 1966, and none that lasted more than a few years. Ewell Monastery (OC) In 1966, the Revd Fr Aelred Arneson OC established the Ewell Monastery Cistercian community,History detailed here. located at West Malling in Kent, which came to receive official recognition by both the Church of England and the worldwide Cistercian Order within the Roman Catholic Church. Fr Aelred OC was the prior throughout the life of the monastery.Details at this directory page. The abbey buildings were constructed on the site of a former farm, with an ancient tithe barn being developed into the community chapel. The chapel still remains after the closure of the monastery and is a Grade II* listed building.Official listing status shown here. The Cistercian Rule was never popular within 20th-century Anglicanism and the community never numbered more than five brothers, although these were often strengthened by temporary residents at the monastery from among the associates of the order. In 2004 the community shrank again leaving the prior, Fr Aelred, as the only remaining member living under vows. The decision was taken to end the Cistercian experiment and the monastery was closed.Closure notice shown here. Fr Aelred continues to live the religious life as a Cistercian solitary. Order of Cistercians, Common Observance (OCCO) In the United States of America in 1981 a group of largely lay-led Anglicans sought to establish a Cistercian association.Basic history is recorded here . The original aim was to establish an association of Cistercian oblates under the care of the Benedictine Order, but the experiment developed into an unauthorised Cistercian community. Having not applied for formal recognition by the Anglican authorities, the Order, now known as the Cistercian Order of the Holy Cross, and still using the post- nomianls OCCO, has developed independently as a non-denominational Cistercian Order. Although its origins are in the Anglican Communion, it is now independent of any denominational structure. Its headquarters are at the Holy Cross Monastery in North Carolina, and it currently admits both first order (professed) members and oblates of both sexes. Anglican Order of Cistercians (OC) In 2006, the Anglican Cistercian Association was founded with the aim of keeping Cistercian thought and devotion alive within the Anglican Communion.The founding of the Anglican Cistercian Association is fully reported here. From this association arose the concept of a new Cistercian order drawing on the Cistercian heritage, the experience of Ewell Monastery, and the enthusiasm of association members for a new form of Cistercian life. A formal monastic order was founded in 2010 as the Order of Anglican Cistercians (OCist), and subsequently changed its name to the Anglican Order of Cistercians (OC). The Anglican Order of Cistercians (OC) is an uncloistered and dispersed religious order of ordained and lay men, single, celibate and married, who endeavour to live according to the Rule of Saint Benedict as expressed in the Trappist tradition. It is currently the main representative of the Cistercian tradition within Anglicanism, and in 2013 it received formal acknowledgement from the Anglican Communion's Advisory Council on the Relations of Bishops and Religious Communities.Order of Anglican Cistercians, in Anglican Religious Life (2018-2019 edition), page 159. The order was founded in 2010, with initial members taking first (simple) vows on 8 September 2011, in the presence of supporters, ecumenical representatives, Abbot Stuart Burns OSB of the Anglican Benedictine Mucknell Abbey (who had been appointed by the Church of England as an official consultant to the new order), and before Bishop Mark Sowerby, Bishop of Horsham, who had accepted the position of Episcopal Visitor to the new order. On 26 May 2017 three members of the Order made their solemn profession at Lambeth Palace in the presence of the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, and the Order's new Episcopal Visitor, Tony Robinson, Bishop of Wakefield, who had succeeded Mark Sowerby.

Ranjini's story gained increased media attention since she was detained with her small children. Her case has raised questions about the ASIO's assessment process. It also highlighted the issue of mandatory detention in Australia, and in particular the issue of children living in detention. Biography Ranjini's husband was killed in 2006 in the Vanni region of Sri Lanka. At a later date, Ranjini and her two small sons Pirai and Kathir escaped to India, from where they boarded a boat to Australia. Long after the boat had run out of food and fuel it finally arrived in Australian waters in April 2010. The Australian Navy brought them ashore for immigration processing on Christmas Island. Later the family of three has moved to Perth, Adelaide and in April 2011 to Brisbane, when they were released to community detention. They received refugee status 5 months later.Hilary Whiteman: \\"Mom locked up in Australia as security risk has baby boy\\", in CNN, January 16, 2013 Ranjini married her second husband Ganesh in April 2012 and moved to Melbourne. Ganesh is a Sri Lankan from the same region as Ranjini, who studied in Australia and received a protection visa in 2009, and later was granted permanent residency. In May 2012 the Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC) summoned Ranjini and her two children and informed her of a negative assessment result from ASIO, without having been explained the reason.Steve Cannane: \\"Family shattered by negative ASIO assessment\\", in ABC, May 12, 2012 Ranjini, pregnant at that time, was flown to Villawood Immigration Detention Centre in Sydney along with her sons aged six and eight at the time. In January 2013 Ranjini delivered baby boy Paari in a Sydney hospital. Three days after the baby was born, both Ranjini and the baby were sent back to Villawood Detention Centre. As Ganesh is permanent resident, Paari is eligible for Australian citizenship, and on that basis could be allowed to leave the centre, but without her mother. Many Australian refugee advocates have taken up Ranjini's cause, including lawyer David Manne from the RILC who has challenged her detention in the High Court. In January 2013, hundreds of people gathered across Australia to celebrate the birth of her third son at an event called Born Free. Refugee advocate Anthony Bieniak created a website - Letters For Ranjini to pay tribute to Ranjini and the other ASIO refugees. The website has collected hundreds of letters which have been passed on to the family. ASIO has never given the reason why she is considered a threat to national security.

The church is now the Chapelle Saint-Michel. View of Avignon showing the Palais des Papes and the Pont Saint-B√©n√©zet. √âtienne Martellange (22 December 1569 ‚Äì 3 October 1641) was a French Jesuit architect and draftsman. He travelled widely in France as an architect for the Jesuit order and designed more than 25 buildings, mostly schools and their associated chapels or churches. His buildings reflect the Baroque style of the Counter- Reformation and include the Chapelle de la Trinit√© in Lyon and the church of Saint-Paul-Saint-Louis in Paris. In the course of his travels he made almost 200 detailed pen drawings depicting views of towns, buildings and monuments. These pictures have survived and provide an important historical record of French towns in the first third of the 17th century. Life Martellange was born in Lyon on 22 December 1569. His father, also named √âtienne Martellange, was a well-known painter in the town. Martellange had two brothers, Berno√Æt and Olivier, who both became Jesuits. Almost nothing is known about his early life. Although it was once believed that he may have spent some time in Rome, this is now considered unlikely. He joined the Jesuit order in Avignon on 24 February 1590, when he was 21, and became a \\"temporal coadjutor\\" in Chamb√©ry on 29 March 1603. The first mention of Martellange as an architect is in 1603. Before this date he is listed as an artist. The Jesuits had established themselves in France in the 1560s but were temporarily banned in 1595 after the attempted assassination of Henry IV by Jean Ch√¢tel. The edict of Rouen issued by the king in 1603 allowed the Jesuits to return and they then began a very active period of expansion. Beginning in 1604 Martellange travelled around France working as an architect and organising the construction of Jesuit schools and novitiates. For each building project he sent plans back to the Jesuit headquarters in Rome where they were scrutinized by the chief architect. Each project also had to be approved by the Superior General. Martellange also sent progress reports and estimates of the cost of the building work. Some of this correspondence has survived, including 65 plans and a number of letters. In the course of his travels Martellange also drew pictures of the local buildings and monuments. These very detailed pen drawings have been preserved and provide a valuable historical record. In around 1637 he retired to the novitiate in Paris that he had himself designed. He died there on 3 October 1641. The Biblioth√®que nationale de France (French National Library) in Paris has a collection of 65 architectural drawings and 176 landscape drawings by Martellange.. Ten letters by Martellange that originally accompanied the architectural drawings are now preserved in the National Library of Malta. The Ashmolean Museum in Oxford has a further 17 landscape drawings. Includes figures of the 17 drawings by Martellange held by the museum. Work as an architect Martellange was involved in the design and construction of more than 25 Jesuit buildings in France. Most were schools with their associated chapels, but he also worked on novitiates (training colleges for Jesuits) in Lyon and Paris as well a professed house in Paris. He began in 1604 with the Jesuit school in Sisteron and for the first few years worked on projects in the region of Lyon but after 1610 he travelled more widely. His surviving buildings include: *Chapel of the Jesuit school in Le Puy-en-Velay, now the √âglise Saint-George or the √âglise du Coll√®ge. *Coll√®ge des Godrans in Dijon, now the municipal library. Martellange probably only had a supervisory role. *Coll√®ge de la Trinit√© in Lyon now part of the Coll√®ge- lyc√©e Amp√®re. The Chapelle de la Trinit√© was consecrated in 1622. It has been restored and is now used as a venue for concerts and exhibitions. *Coll√®ge in Roanne, now the Lyc√©e Jean-Puy and the Chapel Saint-Michel. This school occupied Martellange between 1610 and 1621. The work is well documented; the Biblioth√®que nationale has four plans and also five drawings recording the construction. *Coll√®ge Sainte-Marie in Bourges, now part of the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure d'art. * Coll√®ge Henri IV in the town of La Fl√®che, now part of the Prytan√©e National Militaire and its church of Saint-Louis. *Chapel Saint-Thomas of the school in Rennes, now the √âglise Toussaints. *Chapel Saint-Louis of the Jesuit school in Blois, now the √âglise Saint-Vincent-de- Paul. *Chapel of the Jesuit school in Avignon, now the Mus√©e lapidaire. The museum houses part of the collection of the Fondation Calvet. Martellange produced the initial drawings and oversaw the start of the construction in 1620. Eight years later the project was taken over by the Avignon architect Fran√ßois de Royers de la Valfeni√®re. *√âglise Saint-Louis in Paris, now the √âglise Saint-Paul-Saint-Louis. This was a collaboration between Martellange who drew the initial plans and another Jesuit architect, Fran√ßois Derand, who was responsible for the design of the facade.

Environmental groups are skeptical as the forest includes old growth of ancient and rare species. A nearby stream was diverted into a reservoir at the base of the ski runs. The reservoir supplies water used to create artificial snow for the ski runs.

She is the youngest of the three daughters of designer Adolfo Dom√≠nguez and Elena Gonz√°lez. Tiziana is part of the third generation of the company, founded in 1973 from a tailor‚Äôs shop run by her grandfather.  Training  Tiziana started her training abroad when she was seven years old. She studied in Great Britain, Austria and France, where she learned English, German and French. After finishing her A-levels in Great Britain, she studied a foundation course in Art & Design at Leeds College of Art. She later moved to Vermont, USA, where she earned a Bachelor of liberal arts BA with a major in economics in Middlebury College. In 2017, she earned a AAS fashion design degree at parsons.  Design  From her post as Creative Director, Tiziana Dominguez designs the company‚Äôs collections, along with her father. She introduced ecological materials in all collections and backs sustainable fashion. In 2011, she presented her first 100% ecological line: ‚ÄòGreen Me‚Äô, designer clothes made from organic and recycled fabrics.  Painting and sculpture  In May 2011, she presented her first painting exhibition, \\"Ants, horses & other relatives\\". This was a figurative, expressionist collection, with a lot of colour, where she mixes oil paints with sand, coffee, sawdust, plants, insects and other materials. Her painting is inspired by animals and nature, and her canvases are often transferred to the prints in the collections presented at Cibeles Madrid Fashion Week and her sculptures inspire the designs of the company‚Äôs jewellery.  Corporate ethics  In 2009, she founded the Corporate Social Responsibility Department (CSR) at Adolfo Dominguez S.A. Her achievements include the publication of the Animal Welfare Policy (2010). Through this document, the company rejects the use of exotic animal skins, as well as violent activities or animal abuse, such as plucking feathers from live birds or mulesing.

He is best known for his 2002 campaign, in which he won the World Series Racing Championship and the Cartier Racing Award for European Champion Older Horse. Background Grandera, described by the New Zealand Herald as \\"a stunning individual\\", is a bright chestnut horse with a white blaze and white socks on his three of his feet. He was bred in County Kildare, Ireland by Stan Cosgrove, the manager of the Moyglare Stud. Grandera was sired by Grand Lodge and was the second foal of the Alysheba mare Bordighera making him a half-brother to George Washington. Grand Lodge, a winner of the Dewhurst Stakes and St James's Palace Stakes, sired the winners of almost seven hundred races before his death in 2003, including the Derby and Arc winner Sinndar. Sold as a yearling to Roger Shelton for Ir¬£30,000, he was sent into training with James Fanshawe, but transferred to Saeed bin Suroor at the end of his three-year-old season, having been purchased by Godolphin. Apart from his racing ability, Grandera was known for his difficult temperament, being described by Godolphin's racing manager Simon Crisford as \\"a thoroughly unpleasant beast\\" and \\"a bit nasty\\", whilst Frankie Dettori is reported to have referred to him as \\"a lunatic\\". and \\"a nightmare\\". Racing career =2000: two-year-old season= Grandera began his career with a fifth place in a maiden race at Doncaster in July 2000, before claiming his first win in a similar event at Warwick. He was then moved up to Group company, finishing second in the Somerville Tattersall Stakes, with future Group One winners Imperial Dancer and Storming Home amongst the beaten horses. On his final start of the year he finished seventh behind Dilshaan in the Group One Racing Post Trophy. Commenting on the colt's first season, James Fanshawe later said, \\"He was rather weak as a two-year-old and anything he did then... was going to be a bonus\\". =2001: three-year-old season= Grandera proved himself to be a colt of the highest class in 2001 with a series of placed efforts. He began with a second place in the Dee Stakes at Chester, before running third, beaten less than a length, in the Prix du Jockey-Club. In the Eclipse Stakes at Sandown he took the lead in the closing stages but was caught four strides from the line and beaten half a length by Medicean. Grandera reversed the form with Medicean in the International Stakes but had no chance against the seven length winner Sakhee. He recorded his first win in over a year in September, beating Mubtaker in the Arc Trial, despite failing to run straight in the closing stages and carrying his head awkwardly. After the race Fanshawe announced that the Grandera would be aimed at the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, but the colt was bought shortly afterwards by Godolphin and did not run again that year. =2002: four-year- old season= Grandera sent to winter in Dubai, before embarking on a four- year-old campaign which took him to six different countries. He began with a second place in the Dubai City of Gold at Nad Al Sheba, before moving to Hong Kong where he finished fifth in the Queen Elizabeth II Cup at Sha Tin Racecourse behind Eishin Preston. His next appearance was at Kranji Racecourse in Singapore, where he scored a decisive victory in the Singapore Airlines International Cup, taking the lead inside the final furlong and pulling away to beat the German colt Paolini by two lengths with the Hong Kong champion Indigenous in third. On returning to the British Isles, Grandera produced what was arguably his finest performance in the Prince of Wales's Stakes at Royal Ascot. Despite behaving aggressively towards the other horses in the parade ring and racing with his head at a high, odd angle (\\"as if consulting an airport timetable\\"), he produced a strong run in the straight to pull five lengths clear of a field which included Banks Hill and Nayef As a result of this win, he was sent off 13-8 favourite for the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes a month later, but could finish only fifth behind Golan. He came back to his best in the Irish Champion Stakes at Leopardstown, producing a strong finishing burst to catch the future World Champion Hawk Wing in the last strides and take a short-head victory. His rider, Frankie Dettori called Grandera \\"a very peculiar character but... enormously talented\\" after the race. Seven weeks later, Grandera arrived to contest the Cox Plate at Melbourne's Moonee Valley Racecourse, where special arrangements, including a double-sized stall, were made to accommodate his difficult temperament. Five lengths behind at the start of the short straight, Grandera finished strongly to finish third behind Northerly, ahead of Sunline, Fields of Omagh and Lonhro. On his final start of the year he finished seventh as odds-on favourite for the Hong Kong Cup, but his performances had been enough to win the World Series Racing Championship. =2003: five-year-old season= Grandera stayed in training as a five-year-old, but was less successful. After winning a prep race at Nad Al Sheba, he was fancied for the Dubai World Cup, but was rejected by Frankie Dettori in favour of Sulamani. Familiar doubts about Grandera's temperament resurfaced- one correspondent referred to him as being \\"nutty as a fruitcake\\"- as he finished a well-beaten fourth to Moon Ballad. A return to Europe brought no improvement as he finished down the field in the Prince of Wales's Stakes and Eclipse Stakes. In the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes, his starting price of 33-1 and the fact that Dettori again chose to ride Sulamani both reflected his decline. He was fitted with cheek-pieces, which are normally used to improve a horse's concentration, but seemed \\"reluctant\\" to race and finished eleventh of the twelve runners. He was then retired to stud. Assessment Grandera was named as the Champion Older Horse in the 2002 Cartier Racing Awards. In the 2001 International Classification he was rated 119 making him the thirteenth-best three-year-old colt in Europe, ten pounds below the champion Galileo. In the 2002 International Classification he was rated as 126, placing him third behind Rock of Gibraltar and Marienbard. These ratings covered horses raced in Europe, North America and Japan. Grandera was rated 129 by Timeform. Stud career Grandera was sent to stud at the Yushun Stallion Station in Hokkaido, Japan in 2003, and was also \\"shuttled\\" to stand at the Hunter Region Stud for Darley Australia. In 2010, he was returned to Ireland to stand at the Woodlands Stud, Galway.

Project details EXC 201: QUEST.. Called: 08192011. Effective: 08182011. The key research areas of the cluster are the quantum engineering and the space-time research. The Cluster of Excellence is with scientists from the fields of quantum optics, laser physics, solid state physics, gravitational physics, theoretical physics and geodesy interdisciplinary orientated. Involved are institutes of Leibniz University Hannover and several partner institutions. Speaker of the Excellence Cluster is Wolfgang Ertmer, Deputy Spokesman is Karsten Danzmann.  Research  In the cluster quantum effects for the production of new measurement technologies are being explored. It is working on new concepts that should improve accuracy by targeted use of these quantum effects . Examples are stable and accurate laser systems, tailored optical technologies, special forms of light (squeezed light) and atom interferometers. These technologies are among others used directly in the GEO 600 gravitational wave detector to increase sensitivity. In addition, the technology is also suitable for use in surveying projects, such as for future gravity field satellite missions. The cluster is involved in the development and production of stable and highly accurate (optical) clocks, in particular of portable clocks for the use in space. These clocks are required for applications in precision geodesy such as the GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) and for highly accurate measurements of Earth's gravity. The newly developed technologies should be used for measurements, which shall answer the fundamental questions of theoretical physics of time and space. More specifically, it is about - among other things - the connection between quantum mechanics and gravitation, the test of whether the fundamental constants really constant, and the processes of the creation of the universe.  Outline of the research focuses  The research of QUEST is structured into four research areas A-D: * A: Quantum Engineering * B: Quantum Sensors * C: Space-Time Research * D: Enabling Technologies In addition to the research areas QUEST has set up the so-called task groups that function as interdisciplinary working group and process specific research projects as a cross-structures to the research areas: * T: Task Groups The structure is complemented by the field H, which includes the promotion of young scientists and gender equality: * H: Human Resources  Participating institutions  * Institutes of Leibniz University Hannover  Institute of Quantum Optics  Institute of Gravitational Physics  Institute of Theoretical Physics  Institute of Applied Mathematics  Institute of Geodesy  Institute of Solid State Physics * Laser Zentrum Hannover e.

He was also trained as a goldsmith.  Biography  He was born to a middle-class family. His father, Jehan, ran a hotel called L'Image de Saint-Christophe. He trained with the painter and goldsmith, Edme Dou√© (?-1626), who had married his sister, Simonne, in 1613. At the time, many young painters were attracted to the works of Carvaggio. This prompted him to travel to Rome, where he lived from 1622 to 1625; sharing an apartment with the painter, Charles Mellin, and the sculptor Jacques SarrazinJacques Thuillier, \\"Simon Vouet\\", in La Peinture Fran√ßaise, 1963, pg.98.. He also met and became a lifelong friend of Simon Vouet. He returned to Troyes in 1626, set up a studio and got married shortly after. His workshop was very successful and the numerous commissions he received involved many long stays in Paris. He was, in fact, there for much of the period from 1633 to 1639, In 1636, he was chosen to be the \\"Painter of May\\" for Notre-Dame de Paris. His contribution was Saint Paul Preaching on the Areopagus (destroyed during the Franco-Prussian War). He produced secular as well as religious works. In 1645, he settled permanently in Troyes, purchased some land and built a large manor house. He appears to have painted little after that and was quickly forgotten. By the end of the 17th century, he was only cited by name in relation to Vouet. At some point, he was referred to as Ninet de Lestin, due to a typographical error, which was continued until 1882, when the local historian, , discovered it and did more research on his life. Many of his paintings were destroyed or disappeared; during the French Revolution, the Franco-Prussian War and World War II, although some works have newly attributed to him; notably, personifications of Grammar and Geometry, acquired by the Mus√©e des beaux-arts de Bordeaux in 2011.

There is a unique spiral cantilever oak staircase dating from around 1680 and an embroidered State Bed from 1700. In 1770 the house passed to the Sackville family. Two rooms were redecorated in the Adam style. The house today preserves its medieval origins and the changes in the Baroque period, and is a family home.

Orgue Andre Marchal.fr Georges Danion Musimem.com Danion Musimem Obituary  Biography  Chartres Cath√©dral Danion moved to Paris in 1924. After studying the violin, he played in a Paris orchestra. In 1945, he married Anik Gonzalez, daughter of Fernand Gonzalez and granddaughter of Victor Gonzalez, both renowned organ builders. In 1947, Victor Gonzalez invited Danion to work with him and replace his son Fernand who had died during the war in 1940. Having a passion for technical harmonization, he learned fast with the master. After the death of Victor Gonzalez in 1956, he became head of the Gonzalez company, henceforth commonly referred to as Danion-Gonzalez. Danion continued the neoclassical ideal of his master. The concept of neo-classical organ is a synthesis of the previous aesthetics, many quarrels and polemics within the world of organ making arose on the part of those who refused any developments in the organ-making tradition, including neo-baroque musicians. In 1962, he bought the Jacquot-Lavergne-Rambervillers company in the Vosges, then the oldest manufacturer of organs in the world still in operation since 1750. In 1963, he moved the company to Rambervillers. The premises included a large assembly room, joinery workshops and casting of tin where the entire metal pipe for the new organs could be manufactured. Today the company is led by Bernard Dargassies under the name of \\"Manufacture Vosgienne de Grandes Orgues\\". In January 1980, he founded with his wife, the \\"Manufacture Languedocienne de Grandes Orgues\\", in Lod√®ve, H√©rault. In 1988, the Gonzalez-Danion sold their Rambervillers company and settled in Lod√®ve where they worked on the construction or reconstruction of the organs of St. Esteve in Andorra-la-Vielle, St. Vincent of Carcassonne, St. Paul of Clermont-L'H√©rault, the restoration of instruments in the cathedrals of B√©ziers and Carcassonne, Lod√®ve, the churches Our Lady of La Ciotat, St Peter's Prades, Prats-de-Mollo-la-Preste, as well as the reconstruction of the organ in the Church of St. Sauveur Aix-en-Provence (39 stops) and restored those of St. Peter's in Ceret (36 stops) and Ste-Bernadette Montpellier (13 stops). Since Danion retirement in 1998, the company has been managed by organ builder and harmonist Charles Emmanuel Sar√©lot. In February 1992, George Danion was invited by the University of Denton, Texas to give a conference on organ building at a gathering of some two hundred organists, with Marie-Claire Alain, Marie-Madeleine Durufl√©, Marie-Louise Langlais, and Jacqueline Marchal.

Of the remaining Acoma who survived the attack, many were sentenced to 20-year enslavement and 24 suffered amputations. The massacre was the result of a battle between Spanish colonizers and Native Americans from the Keres Acoma Nation in what is now New Mexico in retaliation for the killing of 12 Spanish soldiers by the Acoma in the previous year. Background In the late 1500s the Spanish Crown began ordering conquest expeditions into the territories of Pueblo peoples, areas of which Spain sought to gain control as part of the colonization efforts in so-called New Spain. In 1595 the conquistador Don Juan de O√±ate was granted permission from King Philip II to colonize Santa Fe de Nuevo M√©xico, the present-day American state of New Mexico. The early years of Spanish exploits in the area had seen but a few mostly peaceful encounters with the Acoma people, who outnumbered the colonizers in the decades after 1540. However, in 1598, Zutacapan, the Acoma cacique and spiritual leader, learned that the Spanish emissaries intended to conquer Acoma Pueblo by force. Zutacapan also learned that the Spanish plan was to have all the Pueblo people move to a new village in the valley, where they would be living under Spanish rule, working for the Crown under the colonial forced-labor system known as encomiendas. Acoma people would also be forced to convert to Catholicism and forsake their traditional beliefs and practices. Seeking to protect the Pueblo's material and religious integrity, Pueblo leadership decided to prepare to resist Spanish aggression. Juan de Zald√≠var, O√±ate's nephew and soldier, was sent to the pueblo to meet with Zutacapan. Upon arriving on December 4, 1598, the Spanish envoy demanded food and shelter for himself and his sixteen men.Knaut, Andrew. The Pueblo Revolt of 1680. Oklahoma: The University of Oklahoma Press: Norman, 1995, p. 69. After being rebuffed, the group reportedly invaded Acoma homes, breaking walls and destroying property in order to take maize and blankets by force, leaving Keres women curled up naked with their children. The Acoma resisted and a fight ensued, leaving Zald√≠var and eleven of his men dead. When O√±ate learned of the incident, he ordered Juan's brother, Vicente de Zald√≠var, to lead an expedition to punish the Acoma and set an example for other Pueblos. Taking about seventy men, Vincente de Zaldivar left San Juan Pueblo in late December or early January and arrived at Acoma on January 21, 1599.Kessel, p. 16 Battle The main battle between the Acoma and the Spaniards began the following morning, January 22. For the first two days the Acoma were able to withstand Spanish forces, until Zald√≠var developed a plan to breach the Pueblo's defenses using a small cannon. On the third day, Zald√≠var and twelve of his men ascended the mesa and opened fire on the Pueblo with the cannon. The heavy artillery proved too powerful for the Acoma, and a large fire that engulfed many Acoma homes ensued. The conquistadors then stormed the settlement. There were an estimated 6,000 people living at or around the Acoma Pueblo in 1599, of whom at least 2,000 were warriors. An estimated 500 men were killed in the battle, along with about 300 women and children. Some 500 prisoners were taken and later sentenced by O√±ate to a variety of punishments after a trial was held at San Juan Pueblo. O√±ate ordered that every male above the age of twenty-five would have his right foot cut off and be enslaved for a period of twenty years. Twenty-four men suffered amputation. Males between the age of twelve and twenty-five were also enslaved for twenty years along with all of the females above the age of twelve. Many of these natives were dispersed among the residences of government officials or at Franciscan missions. Sixty of the youngest women were deemed not guilty and sent to Mexico City where they were \\"parceled out among Catholic convents\\". Two Hopi men were taken prisoner at the pueblo; after each had one of his hands cut off, they were released to spread the word of Spain's might. =Attempts at revisionism= An amateur scholar living near Santa Fe, New Mexico, published his findings in a Letter to the Editor in 2002http://www.nmhcpl.org/uploads/tip_of_toe.pdf in support of El Paso's new statue of O√±ate, specifying that original records from the time translate as 'cut off the ends of their toes' and that no records exist to prove that the sentence was ever carried out. The argument centered on the idea that no one would choose to limit a slave's usefulness by removing their foot. No other scholars have come out in support of this claim. Aftermath The punishments inflicted on those who were not killed in combat included amputation of hands and feet or being sold into slavery. When King Philip heard the news of the massacre, and the punishments, O√±ate was banished from New Mexico for his cruelty to the natives, and later returned to Spain to live out the remainder of his life. Several Acomas escaped capture by the Spanish in 1599 and by 1601 had rebuilt their pueblo, which still stands. =Present- day Acoma views= The massacre remains a sensitive issue among Puebloans. In 1998, during the 400-year anniversary of Spain's founding of New Mexico colony, a group of Acomas cut off the right foot of the twelve-foot Equestrian statue of Juan de O√±ate in Alcalde, New Mexico. They later issued a statement about the incident: \\"We took the liberty of removing O√±ate's right foot on behalf of our brothers and sister of Acoma Pueblo.\\" The foot was replaced the same year. On April 21, 2007, an eighteen foot tall statue of O√±ate ‚Äì the largest bronze equestrian statue in the United States ‚Äì was erected at El Paso, Texas. Members of the Acoma tribe attended the dedication ceremony and protested against the statue's construction.http://listings.guidelive.com/sharedcontent/dws/ent/stories/DN- conquistador_0714gl.ART.State.Edition1.4d5ac28.html On June 15, 2020, the statue at Alcalde was removed by Rio Arriba County officials for safekeeping during the George Floyd protests. The County Commission issued a statement that they had not decided the statue's future. https://www.taosnews.com/stories/onate-statue-taken-down-alcalde-nm,64370 La Jornada, another statue of O√±ate in Albuquerque, New Mexico, was also taken down during the protests by local government officials, following a protest where a counter-protester shot one of the protesters.

PSR J0357+3205 was originally discovered by the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope in 2009. X-ray Bright Tail A very long, X-ray bright tail (over 4 light years across) may be stretching away from PSR J0357+3205. The tail is puzzling because it shares characteristics with other tails extending from pulsars, but differs in certain properties. If the tail is at the same distance as the pulsar then it stretches for 4.2 light years in length. This would make it one of the longest X-ray tails ever associated with a so-called \\"rotation- powered\\" pulsar, a class of pulsar that get its power from the energy lost as the rotation of the pulsar slows down. (Other types of pulsars include those driven by strong magnetic fields and still others that are powered by material falling onto the neutron star.) =Explanation Of The Tail= The X-ray tail may be produced by emission from energetic particles in a pulsar wind, with the particles produced by the pulsar spiralling around magnetic field lines. Other X- ray tails around pulsars have been interpreted as bow-shocks generated by the supersonic motion of pulsars through space, with the wind trailing behind as its particles are swept back by the pulsar's interaction with the interstellar gas it encounters. However, this bow shock interpretation may or may not be correct for PSR J0357, with several issues that need to be explained. For example, PSR J0357 is losing a very small amount of energy as its spin slows down with time. This energy loss is important, because it is converted into radiation and powering a particle wind from the pulsar. This places limits on the amount of energy that particles in the wind can attain, and so might not account for the quantity of X-rays seen in the tail. Another challenge to this explanation is that other pulsars with bow shocks show bright X-ray emission surrounding the pulsar, and this is not seen for PSR J0357+3205. Also, the brightest portion of the tail is well away from the pulsar and this differs from what has been seen for other pulsars with bow shocks. If the pulsar is seen moving in the opposite direction from that of the tail, this would support the bow-shock idea.

Though he was an illiterate peasant, he became a member of the Politburo of the Communist Party of China and Vice Premier of the People's Republic of China because of Mao Zedong's recognition of Chen's the leadership, during the Cultural Revolution, in turning Dazhai into a model for socialist agriculture.Feng Dongshu, Wenmang zaixiang Chen Yonggui, Beijing: Zhongguo Wenlianchubanshe, 2001. According to official record of the Xiyang County in Shanxi Province, from 1967‚Äì1979, under Chen's leadership, the county completed 9,330 projects of agricultural and hydraulic infrastructure construction, extending the total arable land by 98,000 mu (around 16,144 acres), but at the cost of 1,040 casualties including 310 deaths. After Deng Xiaoping initiated the Reforms and Opening up of China in the late 1970s, Chen gradually lost power and resigned in September 1980. He died of lung cancer in Beijing in 1986.

This situation forced Chen Yonggui to start working at a very young age to make a living, so he never received formal education. In 1942, as fighting against communist guerrilla increased in Shanxi Province, where Xiyang County encompassing Dazhai is located, the Japanese tightened their grip on local villages and Chen Yonggui was elected Dazhai representative in the puppet Rejuvenating Asia Society, but resigned and left the village after barely surviving a one-year detention in a concentration camp in 1943‚Äì1944. Because of this, he was briefly detained as a suspected collaborationist after Japan's defeat, but soon released. He eagerly took part at the \\"land reform movement\\" against landlords and joined the Communist Party of China in 1948.Chen Chunnmei, Wode yeye Chen Yonggui: congnongmin dao guowuyuan fuzongli [My Grandfather Chen Yonggui: from Peasant to Vice Premier]. Beijing: Zuojia Chubanshe, 2008.  Political career  =The Dazhai period= Statue of Chen Yonggui in Dazhai In 1952 Chen Yonggui was appointed secretary of the CPC branch committee of Dazhai, succeeding . He led a peasant movement to turn the harsh environment surrounding Dazhai into an environment favourable to agriculture. The plan was a success and later grain output increased steadily, passing from 237 kg per mu in 1952 to 774 kg per mu in 1962. This progress was brutally halted by a series of natural disasters in 1963, which destroyed 180 acres of arable land as well as some of the production brigade's buildings. Despite this setback, the brigade refused any help from the state and completed rebuilding efforts in one year. All of this came to the attention of Mao Zedong, who declared that Dazhai was an example to be followed in the field of self-reliance, launching the directive: \\"Learn from Dazhai in agriculture\\". In December 1964, while attending the 3rd National People's Congress, Chen Yonggui had a dinner with Mao Zedong himself. Chen Yonggui getting greeted by Red Guards during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in 1966 When the Cultural Revolution began, Dazhai's model was emphasized even more.Mitch Meisner, ‚ÄúDazhai: The Mass Line in Practice.‚Äù Modern China (Vol. 4, No. 1), 1978, pp. 27-62. During a meeting with Zhou Enlai, Chen Yonggui was encouraged to create Dazhai's own Red Guard organization, which was later established under the name \\"Jinzhong Field Army\\". He was appointed vice-chairman of the Shanxi Revolutionary Committee in 1967; in the same year, the Cultural Revolution Group approved his \\"five recommendations\\" for conducting the Cultural Revolution in rural areas, published in the CPC Central Committee Document No. 339. In 1969 he was elected member of the CPC Central Committee, and a secretary of the CPC Shanxi Committee in 1971. He once again gained Mao Zedong's approval in 1972 by firmly opposing Shanxi Revolutionary Committee chairman Xie Zhenhua's request to downgrade the Dazhai production brigade to production team. =CPC central leader= In 1973 he was elected a member of the CPC Politburo and transferred to Beijing.Li Jingping, Chen Yonggui zhuan [Biography of Chen Yonggui]. Beijing: Dangdaizhogguo Chubanshe, 2009. He was concurrently secretary of the CPC Xiyang Committee and the CPC Jinzhong Committee. His post as Dazhai Party branch secretary was taken by 22-year-old Guo Fenglian. In January 1975 Chen Yonggui was appointed a vice-premier of the State Council; in March he led a government delegation to Mexico; in September he delivered the keynote speech to the First National Conference for Learning From Dazhai in Agriculture, chaired by fellow vice-premier and next paramount leader Hua Guofeng. He devoted 1/3 of his time to inspection tours, 1/3 to farm work in Dazhai, and 1/3 to work in Beijing; this program was approved by Mao Zedong. Being in charge of agricultural policy, he suggested that Gansu Province adopt the same method employed by Dazhai, but this didn't produce expected results. =Downfall= Chen Yonggui was re-elected to the CPC Politburo in 1977 and vice-premier in 1978 (in the same year he visited Democratic Kampuchea). Despite this, his views were more and more at odds with Deng Xiaoping's rising authority: as Deng moved to consolidate his position, Chen Yonggui proposed to abolish private plots, calling them the \\"tail of capitalism\\". His refusal to approve private plots and carry out the \\"Seeking truths from facts\\" campaign (aimed at repudiating the Cultural Revolution) in Dazhai cost him his posts in the party leadership in Jinzhong and Xiyang in 1979; he was dismissed from the State Council in 1980 in a government reshuffle (when Hua Guofeng lost the premiership), and was not reelected as a Central Committee member in 1982.Qin Huailu, Zhamaojin de fu zongli: Chen Yonggui [The Vice Premier with a White Towel on his Head].

It was the last of three films Wallace made for F. W. Thring. Plot After being fired from his job at a grocer, George, gets a job as a stableboy at a local stud farm run by the Fleming family. He befriends the horse Hotspur who is a favourite to win the Melbourne Cup, and develops a strong whistle which is used to make the horse run fast. Gangsters working for the villainous Coyle are determined to kidnap Hotspur but George figures it out and one is captured. To find out more information, George becomes a waiter at a cabaret where several ballet and vaudeville numbers are performed. Dorothy Fleming is in love with author Harvey Walls, but is pursued by Brian Winters, the owner of rival horse Surefoot. Dorothy promises to marry Winters if Surefoot defeats Hotspur. Coyle arranges for Peters, the Fleming's jockey, to be kidnapped and replaced with his jockey, Slade, with the aim of making sure Hotspur loses. Slade rides the horse and keeps Hotspur back in the field. However George uses his whistle to help the horse win. Dorothy and Harvey are united, as are George and Dorothy's maid.

The script was likely influenced by the real-life attempt of gangsters to kill the race horse Phar Lap prior to the Melbourne Cup.Paul Byrnes, 'A Ticket in Tatts ‚Äì Curator's Notes', Australian Screen Online Shooting began in July 1933. Unlike many of Thring's films, much of the movie was shot on location, at a stuff dark near Melbourne, at Flemington Racecourse and the grounds of a Melbourne villa. Studio scenes were still shot at Efftee's studio at His Majesty's Theatre but it was the last time Thring used it ‚Äì after the film he moved operations to the former Wattle Path Dance Palais at St Kilda which Efftee had bought for ¬£23,000.Andrew Pike and Ross Cooper, Australian Film 1900‚Äì1977: A Guide to Feature Film Production, Melbourne: Oxford University Press, 1998 p164 Release The film was also known as High Stakes and released with the short Dear Old London. It proved reasonably popular at the box office, running for six weeks at a Melbourne cinema. Thring complained about difficulties of securing a decent release in Sydney. It was released in England. Wallace remained under contract for Efftee and appeared for them on stage in Collits' Inn. Plans were also announced to star him in the films Ginger Murdoch and The Black Sheep. However Thring died in 1936 before these could be made. Wallace then made two films for Cinesound which followed the story telling formula of A Ticket in Tatts: \\"George is given a simple labourer's job... Quite innocently is fired... He then becomes involved in a simple wish-fulfilment device... the device is complicated by an equally simple set of stereotyped gangsters who have no motivation beyond innate greed for greater wealth, and in each situation they are foiled, usually accidentally, by George and his friends.\\" References *Fitzpatrick, Peter, The Two Frank Thrings, Monash University, 2012 External links *A Ticket in Tatts in the Internet Movie Database *A Ticket in Tatts at Australian Screen Online *A Ticket in Tatts at Oz Movies *Complete script at National Archives of Australia 1934 films Australian films Australian musical comedy films 1934 musical comedy films Films directed by F.

He is best known for his designs for company town of Pullman, Illinois, the Hotel Ponce de Leon in Florida and Naumkeag in Stockbridge, Massachusetts. Barrett was a founding member and president of the American Society of Landscape Architects. He also maintained a long working relationship with many noted architects and firms of the time including those of McKim, Mead & White, Carr√®re and Hastings and Horace Trumbauer.  Early life  Barrett was born in 1845 near present-day New Brighton on Staten Island. His father, John Thorndike Barrett was a wealthy dye manufacturer with deep roots in New England. His uncle, Col. Nathan Barrett built one of the earliest industrial parks in the country at \\"Factoryville\\" on Staten Island. Barrett went to sea for a brief period before returning to serve in the army during the Civil War. Barrett served with distinction as a 1st Lieutenant of the 156th New York Infantry. Barrett began his training as a landscape architect in 1866 by running his brother's nursery and educating himself in formal designs by available literary sources and with instruction from the family's Irish gardener. At that time the art of landscape architecture was but little known in this country.  Career  Barrett's first commissions began in 1869. His early works were largely rail stations in which he received a contract from the Central Railroad of New Jersey. From this early starting point Barrett began to gain notoriety. In 1880 he gained his most significant commission when he was hired by George Pullman to oversee the layout and design of the company town of Pullman with architect Solon S. Beman. Beman designed all the structures, while Barrett developed the streets, parks, and artificial lake. His work at Pullman led to other municipal commissions throughout the 1880s and 90s including those at Fort Worth, Texas, Chevy Chase, Maryland, and Birmingham, Alabama. Barrett's association with Pullman continued with the design of Pullman's estate in New Jersey. The two men would remain friends til Pullman's death in 1897. In 1885 Barrett was hired by Carr√®re and Hastings to lay out the grounds and surrounding area of the Hotel Ponce de Leon in St. Augustine, Florida. The success of the commission enabled Barrett to become the foremost proponent of formal garden design in the country. Following his work in Florida, Barrett began a long relationship overseeing the landscape designs of numerous country houses for noted architects. His most significant and surviving example from this period is at 'Naumkeag' the Stockbridge home of Ambassador Joseph H. Choate. \\"Naumkeag\\" is one of the earliest instances in which Barrett is known to have worked with Stanford White. Barrett would go one to design many other major American country estates including \\"Lynnewood Hall\\" in Elkins Park PA,(design by Horace Trumbauer), \\"Woodlea\\" in Scarborogh NY (also by Mckim Mead & White) and \\"Hammersmith Farm\\" the Newport home of Hugh Auchincloss. In addition to his many towns and country estates he also designed numerous parks and public grounds most prominently working under Frederick Law Olmsted for the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition at Chicago, Illinois . In 1895 he was appointed landscape architect for the Parks Commission of Essex County, New Jersey. During his period with Essex County he formed a partnership with fellow design John Bogart. The only known and surviving work of Bogart and Barrett is Branch Brook Park in Newark, New Jersey. In 1900 he was appointed a commissioner of the Palisades Interstate Park Commission by Theodore Roosevelt and Foster M. Voorhees. He was the only commissioner of the Palisades Park to serve on both the New Jersey Commission and the New York Commission and the only commissioner to have served as a landscape architect of the Palisade Park as well. Barrett is responsible for planning Rochelle Park, a historic section of New Rochelle, New York, recognized and designated for its significance as one of the nation's first planned residential parks from the turn of the twentieth century. There he created a community of great aesthetic beauty, instituting a variety of garden types including the old fashioned Colonial garden, Japanese, Roman and Moorish gardens, as well as English topiary work. In 1890 he built himself a house within the park itself, designed to illustrate the value of landscape architecture in residential design. Barrett was involved with many professional societies. He was a founding member of the American Society of Landscape Architects and became its president in 1903. He was also active with the National Sculpture Society, for whom he organized numerous exhibitions of works and the National Arts Club.  Later years  Barrett remained busy in the last decade of his life overseeing the designs of public and private works and also publishing numerous works on the subject of landscape architecture. In 1902 he opened a school of landscape architecture within his residence in New Rochelle, New York. He worked up until several months before his death. He died October 16, 1919, at Mount Vernon Hospital in Mount Vernon, New York, from throat cancer. His remaining projects and alterations to his projects were taken on by Olmsted Brothers and Jacques-Henri-Auguste Gr√©ber, with whom he worked closely on many projects, and who were also rivals for work in his later years.  Personal life  Barrett was married June 6, 1870 at Athens, Georgia to Lucy Mildred Lampkin, the daughter of a Confederate officer and of the prominent Cobb family of Georgia. The couple had seven children of which only one survived beyond his father. Lucy Mildred Barrett died May 30, 1886 after which Barrett married Clara Adele Weiss, the daughter of a prosperous Yonkers merchant. The couple had three children of which their son Dettmar died in an electrical accident in Rochelle Park at the age of 16.  Major works  The following sites were major known projects of Nathan F.

They are part of the Gondi people. Traditionally they are economically homogenous and strive to work as a collective. They have mixed- sex dormitories where adolescents are sent to practice premarital sex, sometimes with a single partner and sometimes serially. They have an omnivorous diet, with liquor playing a key role in their society. Etymology Shiva Tosh Das writes that the name Muria comes from the root word mur, which can be translated as either \\"root\\" or \\"permanent\\"; it may be based on the fact that the Muria are settled, unlike the nomadic Maria. Social structure The Muria prioritize collectiveness. They are divided into five phratries: the Nagvans (Snake Race), Kacchimvans (Tortoise Race), Bakravans (Goat Race), Baghvans (Tiger Race), and Bodminkvans (Fish Race). They are not allowed to eat their totem animal, and must mourn it if one dies. Costume Muria women in dance costume Muria dance in Bastar district Male Muria wear clothing similar to that of the Chandrapur District, while the females often dress in simple garments that do not cover the breasts. The style of the garments appears to have been modified after contact with other tribes. Location The Muria live in the north-central part of Bastar district, north of the Indravati River, located in Chhattisgarh state in central India. They live in two administrative divisions: the Kondagaon Tehsil in the east and the Narayanpur Tehsil in the west. Economy Compared to other adivasi, the Muria are relatively prosperous. Their economic stratification has traditionally been homogeneous, with exceptional consumption outside of designated periods, such as feasts, viewed as \\"socially threatening, hubristic, and disruptive\\"; conspicuous wealth has been considered to cause more problems than it solves. Alfred Gell writes that the disparity between their perception of the ethics of consumption and modern production technology has caused some to have more wealth than they are willing to spend. Sexuality and marriage The Muria embrace sexuality from a young age. Youths are sent to mixed-sex dormitories called ghotul, where they live in close quarters and are expected to engage in sexual activities, up to and including intercourse; this expectation does not extend to group sex, which is discouraged. In some ghotul, adolescents are put in monogamous relationships; in others they are discouraged from becoming emotionally attached to their partners, and those who sleep together for more than three nights are punished. Although having privacy for intercourse is considered important, it is not deemed a necessity. Prior to engagement, Muria men may freely engage in sexual intercourse with their mother's brother's daughter or father's sister's daughter, while women may do the same with their father's sister's son or mother's brother's son; this is not allowed after betrothal. Women may freely grab each other's breasts or exchange sexually themed jokes, a custom which becomes more common as they get older. The Muria generally marry late and do not pay dowries. They are not allowed to marry from within their own clan, although a Muria man may marry his cousin; cousin marriage is common, with Muria men often marrying their mother's brother's daughter or father's sister's daughter. Diet The Muria are generally self-sufficient in producing and consuming dal, chickpeas, and lentils. Vegetables, including radishes, eggplant, chili, and tomatoes are eaten during important ceremonies; rice is also eaten at these times. Luxury foods for the Muria tend to be traditional. The Muria people drink a local form of liquor, which plays a key role in social and ritual gatherings. Religion The Muria are traditionally animists, with village and clan deities.

Background 1885 election, and would maintain this dominance in the 1886 election onwards. In the late 19th century Catholics began to migrate in large numbers to the prosperous Ulster Protestant city of Belfast in search of work.Marianne Elliott, (2000), The Catholics of Ulster: A History, London: Penguin, p. 322. By the time of the riots Catholics made up over one-third of the population of the city.Elliott (2000), p. 323. This migration brought with it sectarian tensions as Catholics and Protestants competed for jobs. As the minority, Catholics found themselves discriminated against in this area and were kept at the lower end of the labour market.Elliott (2000), p. 324. At this time there was a real possibility that the British government would establish a devolved Irish parliament (see: Irish Home Rule Movement). Belfast Catholics believed that a devolved Irish government would be sympathetic to their situation and end the discrimination. Belfast Protestants believed this too and feared the end of their privileged position. In April 1886 Prime Minister William Gladstone introduced a home rule bill. On 8 June the bill was defeated in the House of Commons. Riots The introduction of the bill led to renewed sectarian tensions in Belfast. On 3 June a Catholic navvy sneered to a Protestant co-worker that under an Irish government Protestants would never get hired, even in Belfast. This represented the very worst fears of Protestants towards Home Rule and the story quickly spread throughout Belfast. This led to clashes between Protestant and Catholic labourers on the shipyards.UUC History Faculty: The 1886 Home Rule Riots Preachers such as Hugh Hanna played a prominent role in encouraging rioters. The riots intensified on 8 June, the day that the home rule bill was defeated in parliament. Celebrations were held throughout the city to celebrate the defeat. Some of those celebrating attacked Catholic homes and businesses.Jonathon Bardon (2001), A History of Ulster, Belfast: The Blackstaff Press, p. 381. The police found themselves unable to cope with the situation. Reinforcements were sent in from other parts of Ireland. Most of the reinforcements were Catholic. A rumour that the reinforcements were sent by Gladstone to punish Belfast Protestants for opposing Home Rule spread throughout the city. It was encouraged by popular preachers such as Hugh Hanna. The rioters thus began to attack the police, and later soldiers.Bardon (2001), p. 382. Running battles between security forces and rioters lasted until 14 June.Boyd (1987), p. 143. On 22 June the reinforcements were sent home by the city government, although some were kept as trouble was expected on 12 July, the date of annual Protestant celebrations.Boyd (1987), p. 148. Trouble did indeed erupt on the 12th and, contrary to the expectations of the government, the police found themselves overwhelmed by the Protestant attackers. Reinforcements had to be sent into Belfast again and the threat of over 2,000 police officers and soldiers descending on the city caused the rioters to quit by the 14th. On the last Saturday of July Hanna held his annual outing for the Protestant children of Belfast. This outing usually involved a trip out to the country with marching and drum along the way. Hanna agreed to comply with the city's request that he forgo the drumming and marching due to the tense situation.Boyd (1987), p. 150. As the outing made its way through Belfast disappointed local Protestants joined in to march with their own drums and anti-Catholic banners. Marchers deliberately provoked the Catholics by marching into Catholic areas. Taunting quickly gave way to heavy street fighting between Catholics, Protestants and police. Bloody clashes on a par with the riots in June lasted for a few days, but low-intensity rioting continued until September. Officially thirty-one people were killed in the riots, although George Foy, who made surgical reports on the riots, reckoned that the real death toll might have been as high as fifty. Hundreds were injured. Over four hundred arrests were made.Boyd (1987), p. 172. An estimated ¬£90,000 worth of property damage was incurred, and local economic activity was significantly compromised.Ian Budge and Cornelius O'Leary, (1973), Belfast: Approach to Crisis.

In the 11th-12th centuries the church was remodelled in Romanesque style. In 1768 it was demolished and rebuilt in Neoclassical style, only the crypt remaining from the previous edifice. The current fa√ßade dates from 1836. Treviso Cathedral was involved in the Good Friday bombing of 7 April 1944, having part of its library damaged by fire. Description Sights in the interior include the Malchiostro Chapel, designed by Tullio and Antonio Lombardo, which was frescoed by Il Pordenone and which houses the Malchiostro Annunciation by Titian and two canvasses by Paris Bordone. The church has an unfinished bell tower, whose construction, according to the tradition, was stopped by the Venetian government to prevent it from becoming taller than the campanile of St. Mark's Basilica. The crypt houses the tombs of the city's bishops. The Diocesan Museum is home to a fresco by Tommaso da Modena.

He worked as a conjurer in the outback and as a bootmaker in Gawler, South Australia, as well as starting Biograph Pictures in Tasmania. In 1911, he became a projectionist at Kreitmayer's Waxworks in Melbourne, Victoria. He thrived in the cinema trade and opened the Paramount Theatre in 1915 and became managing director of J.C. Williamson Films in 1918, which eventually merged to become Hoyts in 1926. =Efftee= In 1930, Thring sold his interests in Hoyts to Fox Film Corporation and went into film production, establishing Efftee Studios (based on his initials). Over the next five years, Efftee produced nine features, over 80 shorts and several stage productions, including the Australian musicals Collits' Inn and The Cedar Tree. Notable collaborators include C. J. Dennis, George Wallace and Frank Harvey. Thring visited Britain in 1932‚Äì33, where he sold Efftee's entire output: seven features, nine shorts and a series about the Great Barrier Reef made with Noel Monkman. In 1932 Thring became the leader of a campaign for a quota for Australian films. In 1934, he suspended Efftee's operations, announcing that resumption would depend upon the introduction of an effective quota system in Victoria. In 1935, Efftee obtained licence to broadcast from the then-new broadcasting station 3XY which was owned by the United Australia Party (and later the Liberal Party). 3XY originally broadcast from studios in the former ballroom at the top of the Princess Theatre, Melbourne. After New South Wales passed its Cinematograph Films (Australian Quota) Act in September 1935, Thring resumed production in February 1936, in Sydney, becoming chairman of directors of Mastercraft Film Corporation Ltd while remaining managing director of Efftee Film Productions.

He graduated from St Andrews University with an M.A. in 1651. He was licensed as a minister in 1653 and called on 5 September. He was ordained by the Protesters on 3 November 1653 but his ministry was a short one. He died on 8 February 1656. Early life Gray was born in a house still standing on the north side of the Lawnmarket, Edinburgh, in August 1633 (bap. reg. 23). He was fourth son and eleventh child in a family of twenty-one, his father being Sir William Gray of Pittendrum (died 1648), an eminent merchant and royalist, descended from Andrew, first lord Gray. His mother was Geils or Egidia Smyth, sister to Sir John Smith of Grothill, provost of Edinburgh from 1643 to 1646.http://www.cracroftspeerage.co.uk/online/content/gray1445.htm Education Andrew in his childhood was playful and fond of pleasure; but while he was quite young his thoughts were suddenly given a serious turn by reflecting on the piety of a beggar whom he met near Leith. Resolved to enter the ministry, he studied at the universities both of St. Andrews and Edinburgh. He graduated at the former in 1651. Gray was one of that band of youthful preachers who were powerfully influenced by the venerable Leighton. His talents and learning favourably impressed Principal Gillespie. Ministry He was licensed to preach in 1653, and was ordained to the collegiate charge of the Outer High Church of Glasgow on 3 November 1653, although only in his twenty-first year, notwithstanding some remonstrance. One of the remonstrants, Robert Baillie, refers in his Letters and Journals to the 'high flown, rhetorical style' of the youthful preacher, and describes his ordination as taking place 'over the belly of the town's protestation.' He seems to have spoken with an unusual voice and spoke too quietly to hear at first. Following a communion in Killellan he seems to have learned to project his voice. His ministry proved eminently successful, and although only of three years' duration, in the profound impression produced during his lifetime, and the sustained popularity of his published works, Gray had few rivals in the Scottish church. When he was twenty-two, Gray expressed the desire to see his Lord before his upcoming birthday. Six months later, on 8 Feb. 1656, his wish was granted. Andrew Gray died after a brief illness, of a 'purple' fever, and was interred in Blackadder's or St. Fergus's Aisle, Glasgow Cathedral. On the walls of the aisle his initials and date of death may be seen deeply incised. Family Gray married Rachael, daughter of Robert Baillie of Jerviswood and Mellerstain, and Margaret Johnston, on 31 March 1654 and had a son, William, born at Glasgow in March 1655, who probably died young. He had also a daughter, Rachael, who was served heir to her father on 26 June 1669. His widow remarried George Hutcheson, minister at Irvine. Works Many of Gray's sermons and communion addresses were taken down at the time of delivery, chiefly in shorthand by his wife, and were published posthumously. Some yet remain in unpublished manuscripts. Pre-Restoration editions are extremely rare, but a few are still extant. The following are the chief editions known: #'The Mystery of Faith opened up: the Great Salvation and sermons on Death,‚Äô edited by the Revs. R. Trail and J.

In 1834 he was admitted under this act a member of the Aberdeen presbytery. On 14 July 1836, he was appointed minister of the West Church, Perth, where he remained till his death. Gray was a very energetic leader in the controversies which resulted in the disruption of 1843 and the foundation of the Free Church. A pamphlet by him, 'The present Conflict between Civil and Ecclesiastical Courts examined,‚Äô Edinburgh, 1839, had a wide circulation and great influence. On his secession from the Church of Scotland nearly all his congregation followed him. His new church was opened 28 Oct. 1843. In 1845, he drew up at the request of the Free church leaders 'A Catechism of the Principles of the Free Church' (1845 and 1848), which involved him in a controversy with the Duke of Argyll. In December 1841, Gray was commissioned to visit Switzerland to express the sympathy of the Free Church with the suspended ministers of the Canton de Vaud; he extended his tour to Constantinople. In 1855, he was appointed convener of the Glasgow evangelisation committee, and he was always active in home missions and in spreading education. Failing health made another long continental tour necessary in 1859. He died at Perth 10 March 1861. He married, 23 July 1834, Barbara, daughter of Alexander Cooper. Robert Smith Candlish collected nineteen of Gray's sermons, with memoir and portrait, under the title 'Gospel Contrasts and Parallels,‚Äô Edinburgh, 1862.

Education Gaspar holds a degree in economics from the Universidade Cat√≥lica Portuguesa (UCP) in 1982. He received a PhD in economics from the Universidade Nova de Lisboa in 1988. Financial career Gaspar was the director-general for research at the European Central Bank for six years. Then he became an adviser to the Bank of Portugal, having been from 2007 director- general at the Bureau of European Policy Advisers (ERI) with the President of the European Commission. Political career Without any previous political activity, he was appointed Minister of Finance in Pedro Passos Coelho's cabinet on 21 June 2011. In this capacity, Gaspar's policies included a firm intention to accomplish the European Union/IMF-led rescue plan for Portugal's sovereign debt crisis. The rescue plan consisted of widespread tax increases and reforms aimed at better efficiency and rationalized resource allocation in the public sector, in order to reduce the number of unnecessary civil servants and the public sector's chronic overcapacity. Administra√ß√£o P√∫blica obrigada a emagrecer 1% ao ano, Destak.pt (21 June 2011) As time went on it became increasingly clear that a series of supplementary measures would be taken during the course of the year as a means to restrain an out-of-control budget deficit. These included sharp cuts in spending on state-run healthcare, education and social security systems, along with widespread tax hikes. On 18 October 2011 Gaspar told Portugal's main TV channel RTP1 that the wage cuts imposed on civil servants the previous week in the presentation of the State Budget for 2012 were the only way to avoid a much more painful and complex policy of mass firing of civil servants. He said that if wage cuts were not enforced, it would be necessary to sack of about 100,000 civil servants immediately (under Portuguese law, civil servants can't be sacked, so a number of special derogations would be needed to achieve this). Gaspar: alternativa aos cortes seria sa√≠da de 100 mil funcion√°rios p√∫blicos, Expresso On 1 July 2013, he resigned and was replaced by Maria Lu√≠s Albuquerque, who had been Secretary of State of Treasury under him.Portugal's finance minister quits Allegedly he had tried to leave office eight months earlier due to pressure of public opinion, but several newspapers reported the pivotal moment came when he was insulted and spat in a supermarket by other customers when he was shopping with his wife without personal security. He called Pedro Passos Coelho the same day, stressing he wanted to leave the government on the earliest convenience. V√≠tor Gaspar foi insultado e cuspido num supermercado Nevertheless, in his resignation letter, Gaspar stated that his departure was due to the growing erosion of public support for austerity measures., although these policies were largely continued by Albuquerque. Later career Since 2014 he is the director of the Fiscal Affairs Department of the International Monetary Fund.Vitor Gaspar Director, Fiscal Affairs Department More recently Gaspar has come under fire as a result of a number of allegations that he prohibited studies relating to excessive rents being received from the State by EDP - Electricidade de Portugal - from being made public so as not to affect the valuation of EDP ahead of its last privatisation phase. In a parliamentary hearing, the former Minister of Economy, Alvaro Santos Pereira, at present head of research at OECD, and the former secretary State of Economy, Henrique Gomes, confirmed that studies relating to excessive rents, charged by EDP, which for the period 2007-2020 may have amounted to ‚Ç¨4 billion, were presented to Gaspar but he decided not to disclose this information rather than mandating the Ministry of Economy to seek compensation and financial remedies for the State. Incidentally, the terms and conditions of the contracts signed in 2007 by the Portuguese Ministry of Economy, led by Manuel Pinho, and EDP, led by Ant√≥nio Mexia and Manso Neto, are now being investigated for possible collusion and corruption. The parliamentary hearing is still ongoing and it would appear that the Ministry of Finance, led by Gaspar, may have opted for a short term gain (‚Ç¨2.7 billion) in the last phase of privatisation, which in turn has caused significant long term pain (excessive rents ‚Ç¨4 billion) to Portuguese tax payers, consumers and small and medium enterprises as energy costs in Portugal are amongst the highest in the EU.

In a career which lasted from October 1988 until October 1998, he ran seventy times and won twenty-four races. In 1995, Further Flight was voted European Champion Older Horse at the Cartier Racing Awards. He is the only horse to win the same European Group race five times.  Background Further Flight was foaled in Ireland in 1986, sired by the Prix du Moulin de Longchamp winner Pharly out of the Cambridgeshire Handicap winner Flying Nelly, from whom he inherited his grey coat. He became a favourite of the British racing public, competing in and winning long-distance events in a career that lasted from 1988 to 1998. He was trained throughout his career by Barry Hills and ridden in 64 of his 70 starts by Michael Hills. Racing career Further Flight did not appear on the racecourse until the autumn of 1988 when he ran down the field in a minor event at Chepstow. As a three-year- old he ran four times, winning once at Ayr. As a four-year-old he emerged as a top-class staying handicapper winning four races including the Ebor Handicap and finishing second in the Cesarewitch Handicap in which he attempted to give seventeen pounds to the winner. In 1991 he won five of his eight races starting with two handicaps before moving up to Group class to win the Goodwood Cup, St Simon Stakes and his first Jockey Club Cup. He also finished first in the Prix Kergorlay but lost the race after a Steward's Inquiry. In 1992, he was at his peak. A run of four consecutive Group race wins saw him add wins in the Doncaster Cup and Lonsdale Stakes to repeat victories in the Goodwood Cup and Jockey Club Cup. As a seven-year-old in 1993 he captured a second Lonsdale Stakes and a third Jockey Club Cup. 1994 brought a fourth Jockey Club Cup and a win in a listed event at Newmarket. By 1995, it was clear that his very best days were behind him, but wins at Haydock and Doncaster were followed by a fifth victory in the Jockey Club Cup. Further Flight continued to race for another three seasons, winning once in each of them, and putting in a number of good placed efforts, including a third place as an eleven-year-old in the 1997 Jockey Club Cup. Retirement Further Flight was retired in 1998. As a gelding, he had no stud career but had an active retirement at the home of his former jockey Michael Hills. He died after suffering a paddock injury to his hind leg in July 2001. Assessment Further Flight was named Top Older Horse in the 1995 Cartier Racing Awards. Since 1999 the Further Flight Stakes, named in his honour, has been run at Nottingham in April over 1 mile and 6 furlongs. The race has held Listed status since 2003. His longevity and consistency, combined with his distinctive racing style and easily recognisable grey coat made him a popular favourite.

Synopsis Moon in Taurus is the story of a Swiss who, after absence of five years, returns to a small town in America where a love affair had come to an abrupt and, for him, unhappy end. Together with his film team, he tries to discover the reasons for the break-up of his relationship. His ex-girlfriend has since married and is in the throes of divorce. Parallel to this, he re- lives his own love relationship to this woman. Following a period of analytical observation, he becomes more and more involved with his own problems. Background Moon in Taurus, first feature film by Swiss filmmaker Steff Gruber, is a film made entirely in English and filmed in the U.S. (Athens, Georgia), without a story in the usual sense and with a non-pro cast of four playing themselves. The three main characters in the film were actually involved in relationships with one another. Gruber, himself, lived with the woman in the movie for more than one year in Europe. The woman returned to Athens and Gruber followed her. He lived there for less than a year before returning to Europe. There is no rehearsal and there is no pre- planned dialogue. The film records the actual conversations between the three persons and others. The original version included interviews with Cindy Wilson (The B-52's) and Silver Thin (Andy Warhol Factory); these were however omitted from the final cut. The unconventional form in which the film realised its aims brought it international acclaim. Based on selection from 15 hours of documentary materials, the film linked fiction and documentation in an original way. The film was nominated for an award at the International Filmfestival Mannheim Critical reception \\"Obviously, this is a special film for specialized audiences, talky to be sure, but constantly interesting intelligent and mature.\\" Variety, 10 September 1980 \\"Steff Gruber's thorough account of a failed relationship represents a novelty in Swiss film, in its method as well as in its subject. 'Moon in Taurus' does not tell a story but demonstrates how three people try to deal with their his/her story. (‚Ä¶) Not only do two different languages come together (or rather not come together) in this film, but at least two different appreciations of what talking can do for you. Communication functions on many different levels. Not all the questions are answered. On the other hand, a lot of questions are answered in the film that haven't even been asked. Documentary? Fiction? None of both? 'Moon in Taurus' should be seen first of all as an ethnological study.

The resulting election has produced a fragmented political landscape without a coalition of a parliamentary majority more than a year after the election. The centralist Social Democratic Party of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the largest party in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Bosnian Serb autonomist Alliance of Independent Social Democrats, the largest party in the Republika Srpska, each have 8 MPs of the total 42 MPs of the House of Representatives (28 from FB&H; and 14 from RS). Similarly, a crisis of government is also present at the local levels, as well as the Federal entity. As of late 2011, the government has been solved, however the country remains in a situation of perpetual political crisis, especially the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. After months of dysfunction, and arguments about legality, the short-lived Government of the Federation had collapsed in February 2013.  Background  =Sejdiƒá and Finci v. Bosnia and Herzegovina= In 2009, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that the ineligibility of minorities other than the country's three constitutional peoples to run for the House of Peoples or the Presidency was discriminatory. Parties have failed to agree on how to change the current electoral system.Nakon sastanka ƒçelnika 6 stranaka stavovi oko formiranja Vijeƒáa ministara udaljeni =National census= Bosnia and Herzegovina has held one official national census since 1991 while still a part of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and prior to the Bosnian War. This census was held in 2013, but the results have not been published due to debates regarding how to classify the ethnic groups. Holding a census is a condition for the country's EU membership.New European Representative to Bosnia Raises Big Hopes  Local crisis  The Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina had a similar crisis due to the fact that the Bosniak-majority coalition had unilaterally formed a government without the necessary support of Croat representatives. Among Serb and Bosniak Club as well, at least one third of the votes in 17-member Croatian Club in the Parliament's upper house is necessary to elect the president of the Federation (and his deputies) in order to pass a motion of confidence and form a cabinet.Federation's Constitution, Amendment XLII (1) This provision is supposed to ensure Croats, Serbs and others with checks on government, as Bosniaks form 70% of Federation's population. Despite receiving only 5 votes in the Croatian Club, SDP elected the President and formed the government. After the Central Electoral Commission issued a ruling in March 2011 declaring election of the president of the Federation (and his deputies) as well as the government formation illegal, the High Representative Valentin Inzko suspended CEC's two rulings.\\"Inzkova odluka o suspendiranju odluka CIK-a o konstituiranju Vlasti u FBiH\\", 28.03.2011 He thus allowed Bosniak SDP to form the government in the Federation without Croatian representatives, taking HSP, a minor Croatian party as its coalition partner. Croatians held protests and Croatian politicians rejected the unconstitutional and illegitimate authorities of Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina.Samir Huseinoviƒá: Vlast u Federaciji bez dva HDZ-a,Deutsche Welle, 18.03.2011 \\"5‚â†17√∑3\\" became the motto of many Croat protests.  Issues  =Chairman of the Council of Ministers= The major Croat (HDZ and HDZ 1990) and Serb parties (SNSD and SDS) contend that a gentlemen's agreement exists in which the chairmanship of the Council of Ministers rotates between the three constitutional nationalities. In this case, it would be the turn for a Croat politician to chair the council. As the Croatian Democratic Union and the Croatian Democratic Union 1990 received the overwhelming share of Croat votes in the 2010 elections, the parties have demanded that a member of one of the parties receive the position of chairman. SDP on the other hand, claims that the only necessity is the ethnicity of the individual, and not the party, demanding the right to appoint a Croat PM from the SDP ranks, calling upon the right of having assumed most votes nationwide. =EU funding= The government of Bosnia and Herzegovina must agree as to how funds available through the EU's Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance will be divided between the national government, the Federation, and Republika Srpska.Bosnia To Mark Embarrassing Anniversary, September 28, 2011 Government formation talks The European Union and the Office of the High Representative have repeatedly attempted negotiations to appease the Bosniac- Bosnian and Serb-Croat divided political blocs, in parallel to the Bosnian constitutional crisis, all ending in failure. The peaks of the crisis were the moves of the Serb entity to schedule a referendum against the OHR, which were left later on. The Bosniac-Bosnian coalition insists that the seat will have to go to them as the party that received the largest number of votes, while the Serbian-Croatian alliance insists that due to the fact that according to tradition the next Prime Minister must be an ethnic Croat, it must come from an authentic Croat party (Croatian Democratic Union of Bosnia and Herzegovina), and not the non-national SDP. Slavko Kukiƒá, a Croat member of the Social Democratic Party, was nominated for chairman in July by the country's presidency. Croat and Serb parties subsequently voted against the nomination. Although he received a majority of votes in the House of Representatives, he failed to receive the necessary 2/3 majority of votes from the Republika Srpska representatives. On 1 September 2011 Peter S√∏rensen was appointed European Union Special Representative, replacing Valentin Inzko. A round of talks between party leaders was held in Mostar on September 5 hosted by Croat politicians Bo≈æo Ljubiƒá and Dragan ƒåoviƒá, with Milorad Dodik, Mladen Bosiƒá, Sulejman Tihiƒá and Zlatko Lagumd≈æija in attendance.

It has a cylindrical, yellow to dark reddish-brown body and a thin trunk that anchors it to rocks. It is found in subtidal areas of the western coast of North America from Vancouver Island to Baja California. Taxonomy The species was first described by American malacologist William Healey Dall in 1871 as Cynthia montereyensis, and later (1889) by Jesse Walter Fewkes as Clavelinopsis rubra. William E. Ritter placed it in Styela in 1893. Description Styela montereyensis is yellow to dark red brown in colour. It is a solitary species, growing, often in loose groups. It normally grows to about in exposed sites. However, in the more rare, calm habitats, it can grow up to about . The body of Styela montereyensis is elongate and cylindrical, and is attached to a thinner stalk approximately the same length as the body. Its siphons are close together at the distal end, with its oral siphon pointing to the side or downward. The atrial siphon points straight upward. It has a leathery tunic displaying noticeable longitudinal grooves and ridges that extend down the entire length of the body. This species is commonly fouled with foreign matter and small organisms such as algae and hydroids when occurring in harbors, but remains clean in wave-swept habitats. The feeding mechanism of S. montereyensis uses the force generated from underwater current to push water through a feeding apparatus. The flexible stem allows the organism to have its position adjusted passively and the orientation of the siphons optimized by the current, and so foraging is a relatively low-energy activity. Their maximum lifespan is not known with certainty, but one individual was known to have lived for three years and attained a length of . Distribution This species occurs from Vancouver Island and Hope Island south to Baja, California. Habitat Styela montereyensis lives in the low intertidal zone up to approximately in depth. It is a fairly common species within its range, and can be found firmly attached to substrata, pilings, jetties, and on subtidal reefs in waters ranging from calm to extremely rough. Specimens in the Pacific Northwest rarely occur in inland waters, but are normally found in the outer straits and open coast. Populations on the west coasts of Vancouver Island and Washington harbour the crustacean copepod species Pygodelphys aquilonaris in their branchial sacs.
