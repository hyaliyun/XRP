A relaxation is an approximation of a difficult problem by a nearby problem that is easier to solve. A solution of the relaxed problem provides information about the original problem. For example, a linear programming relaxation of an integer programming problem removes the integrality constraint and so allows non-integer rational solutions. A Lagrangian relaxation of a complicated problem in combinatorial optimization penalizes violations of some constraints, allowing an easier relaxed problem to be solved. Relaxation techniques complement or supplement branch and bound algorithms of combinatorial optimization; linear programming and Lagrangian relaxations are used to obtain bounds in branch-and-bound algorithms for integer programming. The modeling strategy of relaxation should not be confused with iterative methods of relaxation, such as successive over- relaxation (SOR); iterative methods of relaxation are used in solving problems in differential equations, linear least-squares, and linear programming.. ) However, iterative methods of relaxation have been used to solve Lagrangian relaxations.Relaxation methods for finding feasible solutions to linear inequality systems arise in linear programming and in Lagrangian relaxation. and loc=Section 4.3.7, pp. 120‚Äì123 cite Shmuel Agmon (1954), and Theodore Motzkin and Isaac Schoenberg (1954), and L.

Definition  A relaxation of the minimization problem : z = \\\\min \\\\\\\\{c(x) : x \\\\in X \\\\subseteq \\\\mathbf{R}^{n}\\\\\\\\} is another minimization problem of the form :z_R = \\\\min \\\\\\\\{c_R(x) : x \\\\in X_R \\\\subseteq \\\\mathbf{R}^{n}\\\\\\\\} with these two properties # X_R \\\\supseteq X # c_R(x) \\\\leq c(x) for all x \\\\in X. The first property states that the original problem's feasible domain is a subset of the relaxed problem's feasible domain. The second property states that the original problem's objective-function is greater than or equal to the relaxed problem's objective-function.  Properties If x^* is an optimal solution of the original problem, then x^* \\\\in X \\\\subseteq X_R and z = c(x^*) \\\\geq c_R(x^*)\\\\geq z_R. Therefore, x^* \\\\in X_R provides an upper bound on z_R.

The book was Hohlbein's first success as a writer and the starting point of his career as one of Europe's most well-known and prolific fantasy writers. It was published in over a dozen countries and sold more than two million copies, and became the first Hohlbein novel released in the English-speaking world in 2006. Plot introduction  The novel tells the story of the land that people travel to when they dream, and how a young boy finds courage and strength in fighting, but also in accepting, his own deepest fears and nightmares. Plot summary Kim is an average German schoolboy who hates math but loves to read the latest copy of Star Fighter. His daydreaming life spirals into a nightmare when his parents inform him that his little sister Rebecca has fallen into a mysterious coma after her appendicectomy. A visitor from the realm of Magic Moon, the wizard Themistocles, tells him there is only one way to free her from the enchantment of eternal sleep: Kim himself must travel into the land of dreams and save her from the dark wizard Boraas, who has captured her soul. So his next dream pulls Kim into Magic Moon, where he must fly a spaceship, disguise himself as a dark warrior, fight dangerous monsters and fantastical creatures, and journey ever-onward through forests and mountains to the end of the world, only to find out that the answer to saving Rebecca ‚Äì and Magic Moon ‚Äì lies within himself.  Sequels  The story of the adventures of Kim Moon Magic continued on a second novel, M√§rchenmonds Kinder (\\"Children of Magic Moon\\") in 1990 and a third, M√§rchenmonds Erben (\\"Magic Heirs Moon\\") in 1998.

History  General Miguel Primo de Rivera y Orbaneja entered power in September 1923 through a successful military coup in the mould of 19th century pronunciamientos that won the acquiescence of King Alfonso XIII, putting an end to the previous model of liberal and parliamentary monarchy (based on the 1876 Constitution) and, thus, undermining the constitutional legitimisation of the monarch. The first part of the dictatorship from 1923 to 1925 comprised a military directorate. On 3 December 1925, Primo de Rivera installed a Civil Directorate with a Council of Ministers featuring civilians. Primo de Rivera, increasingly unpopular in the late 1920s, handed in his resignation in January 1930 after losing support from the military and the King, who appointed General D√°maso Berenguer in order to replace him.

Retrieved November 30, 2018, Televisi√≥n P√∫blica Argentina was a Uruguayan actor well known for his many spaghetti western performances. Sometimes credited as Jorge Hilton, he appeared in over 20 Euro-westerns as well as several Giallo and action films.  Biography  Born in Montevideo, Uruguay. He began his career working in radio. In 1955 he moved to Argentina, adopting the pseudonym Jorge Hilton. He soon began to appear in several soap operas and film production for Argentina's domestic market. In 1963 he moved to Italy, following the footsteps of other famous South American actors such as the Argentines Jorge Rigaud and Alberto de Mendoza, who were attracted by the thriving Italian film industry of the '60s. After Anglicizing his name to George, he got the lead role in The Masked Man Against the Pirates (Il corsaro nero nell'isola del Tesoro, 1965) and appeared in the Franco and Ciccio Bond spoof comedy Due mafiosi contro Goldginger, directed by Giorgio Simonelli. His career in the Euro-western genre was launched by director Lucio Fulci with the film The Brute and the Beast (1966), starring Franco Nero, where his supporting role made him an instant icon in the genre. In 1967 he appeared to even greater effect as \\"Stranger\\" in Any Gun Can Play (also known as Go Kill and Come Back) with Edd Byrnes and Gilbert Roland. In the following year he participated in seven productions, enhancing his international reputation and garnering him significant attention, especially in Spain. Soon Hilton became one of the major stars of spaghetti westerns, eventually playing Sartana in the last film of the \\"Sartana\\" series, Sartana's Here‚Ä¶ Trade Your Pistol for a Coffin, after Gianni Garko left the role. His most famous character is arguably that of the gunslinger Allelujah (or Hallelujah) in They Call Me Hallelujah (1971), created with director Giuliano Carnimeo, who also directed the sequel involving the same character (Return of Hallelujah, 1972) as well as Man Called Invincible (1973), in which Hilton played Tresette, another of his famous roles. Besides westerns, Hilton appeared in numerous \\"gialli\\" (mostly in the 1970s), and in more conventional crime and action films after the spaghetti western craze ended. In his last years Hilton reduced his film appearances but nevertheless remained active, and he is still fondly remembered as one of the biggest stars of Italian cinema, along with Terence Hill, Franco Nero and Giuliano Gemma. His legacy as a film star also remains intact, with Hilton asked to do many interviews and retrospectives on his film career on a regular basis.Massacre Time (Le colt cantarono la morte e fu... tempo di massacro - 1966) and studio interview with George Hilton 11-27-2018, Filmoteca, Film Themes (on YouTube) On July 28, 2019, Hilton's former wife and partner released a statement on his social media accounts announcing Hilton had died after a long undisclosed illness in Rome, Italy.

He is also known for Teitlebaum's Window (1970), a comic novel about a Jewish boy growing up in Brooklyn in the 1930s and 1940s. Markfield was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1965 after the publication of To an Early Grave.  Life  Markfield was born in Brooklyn, New York, and graduated from Abraham Lincoln High School, earning a B.A. from Brooklyn College in 1947, then doing his graduate work at New York University between 1948-1950. While giving a lecture on \\"St√©phane Mallarm√© and Alienation\\" at the City College of New York, Markfield was interrupted by potato salad splattering suddenly onto his face. The disruptive potato salad, thrown by Carl Solomon and two of Solomon's friends, including future National LGBTQ Task Force co-founder Ron Gold, was an effective demonstration of the principles of Dadaism, one of the subjects Markfield was discussing in his lecture. Many in the audience did not appreciate the irony. The potato salad incident would later be immortalized in Allen Ginsberg's famous poem, Howl. In 1948 Markfield married Anna May Goodman; the couple had a daughter named Andrea. He later taught creative writing at San Francisco State College (1966‚Äì68), Kirkland College (1968‚Äì69), and Queens College (1971‚Äì73). At the time of his death he had been working on a novel for eleven years. Markfield died of a heart attack in Roslyn, New York, on May 24, 2002. Work In addition to To an Early Grave and Teitelbaum's Window Markfield also wrote You Could Live If They Let You (1974), Multiple Orgasms (1977) and Radical Surgery (1991). The 1991 thriller was already conceived by the end of the 1970s. Throughout his writing career, Markfield also contributed at least 40 articles to periodicals. Dalkey Archive Press reissued Teitlebaum's Window in October 1999 and To an Early Grave in December 2000. Multiple Orgasms In an interview conducted in the spring of 1978 at Markfield's home in Port Washington, New York he said: \\"[Multiple Orgasms] was a first person narrative, completely through the eyes of a woman. I found it awfully tiresome after a while, though I never find women tiresome. But she became just a great bore to me. After about a hundred and seventy-five pages or so, I just gave up. It was getting nowhere.\\" It was published only as a limited edition of about three hundred copies, individually numbered and signed by the author.

It was formed 7000 years ago when rising sea levels flooded what were once coastal plains. The underlying rocks are among the oldest on earth, formed in the Archaean period more than 2400 million years ago. It is named after William Dampier, an English buccaneer and explorer who visited in 1699. Dampier named one of the islands Rosemary Island.

The story is about a girl named Kiri, who poses as a male model in order to protect her childhood love, a boy named Tohya. Kiri has always looked masculine, inheriting the looks of her fashion- model father. Tohya, on the other hand, has always been revered for his beautiful looks and delicate features. Never feeling worthy enough for Tohya because of her looks, Kiri vowed she would reveal her true feelings to Tohya once she becomes as beautiful as a \\"princess\\". After a photographer sees a photo of him, Tohya is offered a job to be a male model. Tohya accepts, but Kiri becomes worried that Tohya wouldn't be an able to defend himself in such an environment. She begs her mother, who owns the modeling agency, to give her a job as a model to be by Tohya's side. Her mother agrees, but because the opening's only for a male model, Kiri would have to pose as a boy. Kiri reluctantly agreed, forgoing her goal of becoming a princess in order to protect Tohya. Soon enough, Kiri and Tohya are surprised by their sudden fame when they start seeing their photos in magazines, posters, and billboards. And not before long, boys and girls start falling for both Kiri and her male model identity.  Characters  :The protagonist of the story, Kiri is a 15-year- old girl known as a \\"prince\\" due to her masculine looks she inherited from her fashion-model father. With high eyes, broad shoulders, an inability to grow out her hair, and her 5'9\\" height, Kiri makes a declaration at the age of four to become a prettier princess than Tohya, so that one day she can marry him. She has never confessed her feelings about Tohya to him, because of her insecurities about her looks that are keeping her from doing so. Kiri enters the world of fashion modeling secretly as a boy under the pseudonym, , to watch over and protect Tohya from people who would want to take advantage or hurt him. Most of Kiri's admirers are girls, which just complicate matters more. Kiri can be extremely erratic when it comes to complicated decisions, especially when they involve Tohya. :A boy who has lived next door to Kiri since childhood, he is the object of Kiri's affection. Known as a \\"princess\\" due to his petite frame and feminine looks, he wants to become a \\"prince\\" just as much as Kiri wanting to become a princess. He enters the world of fashion modeling when a client of the Minase Modeling Agency becomes infatuated with a photo of him. Tohya has a rather stoic personality, and is unaffected by all the attention he receives from the girls at his school. He has feelings for Kiri and tries to hide it from his manager so he won't harass her. From time to time, he likes to remind Kiri of her goal to become \\"a princess\\". :Kiri's best friend and confidante. She affectionately likes to jump and tackle Kiri with a big hug upon seeing her. Natsu is the only person other than Tohya and Kiri's mother that knows of Kiri's secret male model identity. With her blunt honesty, advice and opinions, Natsu is always there for Kiri and keeps her grounded. Natsu is also very protective of Kiri, once threatening Tohya that she won't \\"forgive him\\" if he ever hurts Kiri. It is confirmed that she likes Kiri and would date her if she were a man. :An accomplished male model, Akira is the son of the photographer that hires Tohya and \\"Tatsuki\\". He works with Tohya and Tatsuki in their first photo shoot, and instantly takes a dislike to Tohya because of his looks and lack of emotion in his poses. Although he doesn't know Tatsuki is actually Kiri posing as a boy when they first meet, Akira becomes attracted to Tatsuki and kisses \\"him\\" when Tatsuki apologizes for punching Akira after he insulted Tohya. Akira claimed that Tatsuki was kind of \\"girly\\" and \\"cute\\". Akira then becomes attracted to Kiri (without her disguise on) after running into her on the street. At first Akira is only playing around with Tatsuki/Kiri, but in the end he falls in love with her. Akira knows that Tatsuki is Kiri, but he chooses to say nothing. Akira persistently makes advances at Kiri, but Kiri always rejects his offers. :Kiri's mother is the owner of her own modeling agency, the Minase Modeling Agency. Short on a male model, she gave Kiri a job as a model only if she posed as a boy. Kiri reluctantly agreed so she could spend time with Tohya and protect him at the same time. The only conditions her mother gave Kiri were that the public can not find out that \\"Tatsuki\\" is a girl, and that no one discovers that she is her mother. She stresses that if these secrets were to get out, not only would Kiri be fired, but it would put the reputation of her agency at risk. She likes to tease Kiri about her appearance from time to time. :Kiri's father is a top model. He is divorced to Kiri's mother because he is always busy working and can't stay in one place, because he also works overseas. He looks exactly the same like Kiri, and so he helps Kiri every time Tatsuki/Kiri is suspected as the same person. He is cheerful and rather childish at times. It seems like he still loves his wife and wishes to re- marry but Kiri's mother always rejects him. Kanou and Riku :Kanou and Riku work at the same company as Akira and participated in the Fashion show. These two competed for the 'exclusive' contract with the other three. During the time they spent with Kiri and the others, they began helping one other, mainly Kanou and Kiri, but Riku helped mentally. Kanou also really cherishes Riku because of what he had done in the past. They have a special relationship and really close to each other. Kanou is half Chinese, and Riku and Kiri tell him that his \\"blood\\" has much history. So that is how the story begins. Reception Publishers Weekly noted the \\"volatile insecurity\\" of the characters that \\"may accurately represent how adolescents view themselves\\", but thought that \\"adult readers are apt to giggle\\".\\"Never Give Up, Vol. 1\\" (review), Publishers Weekly, March 6, 2006.

Life and playing career Born at Preston, Lancashire, England, Baron played as an amateur for hometown club Preston before he was signed for Liverpool by George Kay in August 1945. He made his debut on 5 January 1946 in Liverpool's first competitive game after the conclusion of World War II; it was an FA Cup 3rd round 1st leg match at Sealand Road Chester, and was a debut to remember for Baron. Not only did the Reds beat Chester City 2‚Äì0, Baron made his debut alongside Liverpool legend Billy Liddell. Baron's first goal came on 8 November 1947 in a league match at Anfield. Grimsby Town were the visitors and Baron's 77th-minute strike secured the points in a 3‚Äì1 victory. Baron did not break into the 1946/47 championship winning side, but played six times the following season. Baron finally established himself as a first team regular in the 1949/50 season, the inside- forward only missed 4 of the 42 league games scoring 7 times, he also appeared in all 7 FA Cup ties scoring in the 3-1 4th round win over Exeter City at Anfield. The final was a mixture of emotions for Baron and the Reds, from being on a high for being part of the squad that took Liverpool to their first ever Wembley final to feeling the heartache of defeat after Arsenal won the match 2‚Äì0. Baron's appearances took a downward turn during the 1950/51 season, but he won his spot back for the following campaign and only finished second to Liddell in the appearance chart, Liddell with 43 (40 league, 3 cup) and Baron with 41 (40 league, 1 cup). Kevin also chipped in with 6 goals. He went on to appear another 44 times over the next 2 seasons, before leaving Liverpool in May 1954; he moved on to Southend.

Durham (1896 - 1970) was a resident of Sherman, Texas for much of his life. He was notable as an African-American attorney and leader in the civil rights movement. Biography Born on a farm near Sulphur Springs, Texas, Durham attended Emporia State University in Kansas. After serving in the United States Army in France during World War I, he moved to Sherman where he studied law in the office of a white attorney, Benjamin F. Gafford. Durham was admitted to the bar in 1926 and began practicing law. Durham spent the rest of his life fighting for equal rights for blacks in Texas, despite a race riot in Sherman in May 1930, where the black business district, including Durham's office, was burned. He became a leader in the Texas NAACP and served as the attorney in more than forty civil rights cases that sought to end segregation throughout Texas. His most famous case was Sweatt v. Painter (1950) which resulted in the integration of the University of Texas School of Law. Durham and Thurgood Marshall worked closely in crafting this case from quarters in the Durham family home in Sherman. Durham eventually moved his practice to Dallas, Texas, and practiced law there for many years. When he died on December 22, 1970 he was buried in Greenville Cemetery in Greenville, Texas.

It was founded in 1533 at the influx of the Pechenga River into the Barents Sea, 135 km west of modern Murmansk, by St. Tryphon, a monk from Novgorod. Inspired by the model of the Solovki, Tryphon wished to convert the local Skolts to Christianity and to demonstrate how faith could flourish in the most inhospitable lands. His example was eagerly followed by other Russian monks. By 1572, the Pechenga Monastery counted about 50 brethren and 200 lay followers. Six years after St. Tryphon's death in 1583, the wooden monastery was raided and burnt down by the Swedes. It is said that the raid claimed the lives of 51 monks and 65 lay brothers, bringing the history of Tryphon's establishment to an end. This revenge raid was carried out by a Finnish peasant chief Pekka Antinpoika Vesainen on December 25, 1589, and was part of the Russo-Swedish War of 1590‚Äì1595. In 1591 Tsar Fyodor I ordered to revive the monastery in the vicinity of Kola, but the new hermitage fell in flames in 1619. Although the New Pechenga Monastery was eventually moved to the town itself, it was so sparsely settled that the Holy Synod deemed it wise to disband it in 1764. As the Russian colonization of the Kola Peninsula accelerated in the late 19th century, the Pechenga Monastery was restored at its original location in 1886. Prior to the Russian Revolution, it consisted of the Upper Monastery, commemorating the graves of Tryphon and 116 martyrs of the 1589 raid, and the new Lower Monastery, overlooking the Pechenga Bay. The stauropegic monastery continued to flourish when Pechenga became part of Finland in 1920. At the end of the Continuation War in 1944 the Moscow Armistice granted Petsamo to the Soviet Union. The brethren were evacuated to the New Valamo Monastery, where they kept their autonomy until 1984 when the last of them died at the age of 110. Although the monastery buildings were destroyed during the war, the Russian Orthodox Church decreed the reestablishment of the monastery in Pechenga in 1997.

Most are yellow to dark brown, but some species are green. They are small; most have forewings 4‚Äì10 mm long (some up to 18 mm). These insects differ from the somewhat similar Chrysopidae (green lacewings) not only by the usual coloring but also by the wing venation: hemerobiids differ from chrysopids in having numerous long veins (two or more radial sectors) and forked costal cross veins. Some genera (Hemerobius, Micromus, Notiobiella, Sympherobius, Wesmaelius) are widespread, but most are restricted to a single biogeographical realm. Some species have reduced wings to the degree that they are flightless. Imagines (adults) of subfamily Drepanepteryginae mimic dead leaves. Hemerobiid larvae are usually less hairy than chrysopid larvae. Hemerobiids, like chrysopids, are predatory, especially on aphids, both as larvae and adults. The species Micromus tasmaniae is bred for biological pest control. Systematics The relationships between the Hemerobiidae and the other Neuropteran families are still unresolved. Despite their superficial similarity to chrysopids, the brown and green lacewings may not be as closely related as was at one time believed. Rather, the Hemerobiidae appear to be closely related to the Mantispidae. The superfamily Hemerobioidea is currently restricted to the Hemerobiidae. Formerly, the pleasing lacewings (Dilaridae), silky lacewings (Psychopsidae), giant lacewings (Polystoechotidae) and as noted above the green lacewings (Chrysopidae) were placed therein too. Of these, only the Dilaridae and Chrysopidae seem to be reasonably close relatives of the brown lacewings. The Psychopsidae in fact seem to belong to an altogether different suborder of Neuroptera, the Myrmeleontiformia. Phylogeny Cladogram of Hemerobiidae relations, based on morphological and molecular data. Psychobiellinae was rearranged into Notiobiellinae and Zachobiellinae, and Adelphohemerobiinae was placed as incertae sedis. Genera The subfamilies of Hemerobiidae are: Drepanepteryx phalaenoides adult (Drepanepteryginae) Courtship of Micromus variegatus (Microminae) * Subfamily Adelphohemerobiinae ** Genus Adelphohemerobius Oswald, 1993 * Subfamily Drepanacrinae ** Genus Austromegalomus ** Genus Conchopterella ** Genus Drepanacra * Subfamily Carobiinae ** Genus Carobius * Subfamily Drepanepteryginae ** Genus Drepanepteryx Leach, 1815 ** Genus Gayomyia ** Genus Neuronema * Subfamily Hemerobiinae ** Genus Biramus ** Genus Hemerobiella ** Genus Hemerobius Linnaeus, 1758 ** Genus Nesobiella ** Genus Wesmaelius Kr√ºger, 1922 * Subfamily Megalominae ** Genus Megalomus Rambur, 1842 * Subfamily Microminae ** Genus Megalomina Banks, 1909 ** Genus Micromus Rambur, 1842 ** Genus Nusalala Nav√°s, 1913 * Subfamily Notiobiellinae ** Genus Anapsectra ** Genus Notiobiella ** Genus Psectra Hagen, 1866 ** Genus Zachobiella *Subfamily Psychobiellinae ** Genus Psychobiella * Subfamily Sympherobiinae ** Genus Neosympherobius ** Genus Nesobiella ** Genus Sympherobius Banks, 1904 Apart from the genera assigned to subfamilies, the genus Notherobius is of uncertain or fairly basal position. Fossils Wesmaelius makarkini from Lower Miocene China. A photograph of forewing under alcohol B Line drawing of forewing. Numerous fossil Hemerobiidae have been described, some from the still-living genera, others from genera that are entirely extinct today. While most have been found in Eocene to Miocene rocks or amber, Promegalomus is known from the Jurassic. It was formerly considered to constitute a distinct family Promegalomidae, but is currently recognized as a very basal member of the Hemerobiidae. The Cretaceous Mesohemerobius was formerly considered a brown lacewing, but is today rather placed as incertae sedis in the Neuroptera; it might be a member of the Hemerobioidea but not even that is certain. Notable fossil Hemerobiidae genera are: * Bothromicromus Scudder, 1878 (Eocene/Oligocene; Quesnel, British Columbia) * Brasilopsychopsis (Cretaceous, Crato Formation Brazil) * Cratopsychopsis (Cretaceous, Crato Formation Brazil) * Cretomerobius Ponomarenko, 1992 (Cretaceous to Ecoene; Bon-Tsagan, Mongolia; Klondike Mountain Formation, Washington) * Mucropalpus Pictet, 1856 (Eocene; Baltic amber) * Prochlanius Kruger, 1923 (Eocene; Baltic amber) * Promegalomus Panfilov, 1980 (Jurassic; Chimkent Oblast, Kazakhstan) * Prophlebonema Kruger, 1923 (Eocene; Baltic amber) * Prospadobius Kruger, 1923 (Eocene; Baltic amber) The extinct genus Hemerobites was originally described in 1813 from a specimen preserved in Baltic amber as a hemerobiid. However further study has resulted in its synonymy with the genus Eutermes and placement in the termite subfamily Termitina. The species Wesmaelius mathewesi, was described in 2003 from a solitary Eocene fossil found near Quesnel, British Columbia, and placed into the extant genus Wesmaelius. At that time it was the oldest Hemerobiinae species described. Another species from the same genus, Wesmaelius makarkini was found in Garang Formation of Zeku County, Qinghai Province, China, in 2018. The finding is from Lower Miocene. Some additional brown lacewing larvae have been found as fossils, but it has been impossible to determine their generic or subfamilial association.

Remote gates also use stairs for boarding but require ground transportation to move passengers between the terminal and the aircraft parking location. Domestic vs international At most gates a single doorway opens to a jet bridge which leads to the aircraft door depending on aircraft model. If the gate is being used for departures, domestic arrivals, or international arrivals coming from airports with preclearance for the destination airport, a door that goes to a waiting area will be opened and a hallway to customs will be closed, preventing passengers from entering into the customs hall. For international arrivals who are coming from cities that do not have preclearance, the door leading to the waiting area is closed and passengers are directed to a hallway where they can either go into the customs hall, if they end at that city, or clear customs and pre-board security if they have a connecting flight. Jet bridge vs airstair Before the era of the jet bridge or jetway, airline passengers embarked onto the aircraft from ground level via airstairs. If initially indoors, passengers would exit the waiting area through a door to the outside and then passengers would proceed to the airstairs leading to the aircraft door. This method is still used for boarding smaller planes or boarding at smaller airports. Ownership The equipment is either airport or airline property, in most cases airport infrastructure.

Established in 1921 as Kashi Vidyapith and later renamed, it is administered under the state legislature of the government of Uttar Pradesh. The university has more than 400+ affiliated colleges spread over six districts. It is one of the largest state universities in Uttar Pradesh, with hundreds of thousands of students, both rural and urban. It offers a range of professional and academic courses in arts, science, commerce, agriculture science, law, computing and management. Foundation Babu Shiv Prasad Gupta and Bhagwan Das established the university in Varanasi, on 10 February 1921, during the non-cooperation movement of the freedom struggle. Originally named Kashi Vidyapith, the university was renamed Mahatma Gandhi Kashi Vidyapith in 1995. It was inaugurated by Mahatma Gandhi. Kashi Vidyapith was the action field of the Indian National Movement & a pilgrimage for the Socialists. Inspired by Gandhi's call for self-reliance and swaraj (self-rule), the Kashi Vidyapith was the first modern university organised by Indians in British India. The university, along with contemporaries such as the Jamia Millia Islamia and the Gujarat Vidyapith, were outside the control and support of British authorities, supported and managed entirely by Indian nationalists and educationalists. Attracting young Indians from across the country, its faculty included prominent nationalists and scholars such as Acharya Narendra Dev, Rajendra Prasad, Jivatram Kripalani, Shriprakash and Sampurnanand. Gandhi and Indian nationalists encouraged Indians to boycott British-run institutions in favour of institutions managed entirely by Indians. Many prominent Indian industrialists and politicians provided financial and administrative support to the university. Bhagwan Das was the first vice-chancellor. Others associated with the first board of management included Mahatma Gandhi, Lala Lajpat Rai, Jamuna Lal Bajaj, Jawahar Lal Nehru, Shiv Prasad Gupta, Acharya Narendra Dev, Krishna Kant Malviya, and Purushottam Das Tandon. The founding ceremony of the Vidyapith reverberated with the recital of Vedic mantras as well as excerpts from the Quran in the presence of educationists, learned persons and nationalists such as Pandit Motilal Nehru, Maulana Mohammed Ali and Maulana Abul Kalam Azad. Established with the resolution to keep the institution away from government recognition and grants, the Vidyapith was accorded the status of \\"Deemed University\\" by the UGC in 1963. This epoch-making event started a new chapter for the institution. Babu Sampurnanand was appointed as the chancellor and Acharya Birbal Singh as vice-chancellor. As the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, Pt. Kamlapati Tripathi initiated a state government resolution to have his alma mater acknowledged as a statutory university; this would occur on 15 January 1974. At this point, Professor Raghukul Tilak was vice-chancellor and the Governor of Uttar Pradesh and would become the chancellor in accordance with the U.P. University Act. At present, the M.G. Kashi Vidyapith is flourishing under the able leadership of its current vice-chancellor, Prof. T.N. Singh. Cultural and political background Mahatma Gandhi Kashi Vidyapith owes its birth to the educational, cultural and political aspirations of pre- independence India. The early period of this institution pulsated with the national freedom struggle. The teaching provided original dimensions to the concept and movement of Indian socialism. After seeing an educational institution in Japan during a visit in 1913‚Äì14, Prasad Gupt was inspired to establish an institution in India, free from government aid or interference. The boycott of government-aided educational institutions during the Non- Cooperation Movement coupled with Mahatma Gandhi's programme of National Education exerted a great deal of influence on Prasad Gupt. As a consequence, the Vidyapith came into being. Students joining Mahatma Gandhi's boycott call took admission in the Vidyapith.Shiv Prasad Gupta established the Har Prasad Smarak Nidhi in memory of his deceased brother, for the operation of the Vidyapith, which subsequently proved to be a fertile nursery for national freedom movement activities. Objectives Commitment to democracy, equality of all religions, staunch support to nationalism and to Indian socialism and enrichment of Hindi as a national language has been throughout a tradition of the Vidyapith. As per the declaration contained in the founding resolution of the Vidyapith, the objectives of this national educational institution are to strive to enhance and propagate: * The development of Indian civilization and culture based on spiritualism. * Homogeneous intermingling of all the sections of Indian society. * Coordination among different thoughts and cultures. * The notion of independence and patriotism along with the feeling of brotherhood and the urge to serve mankind. * Ancient and modern development in the fields of various disciplines of learning, sculpture, science and technology. Administration The chancellor, the vice chancellor and the members of the executive council, the court and the academic council of the university, constitute a body corporate: Mahatma Gandhi Kashi Vidyapith Varanasi. The university has a perpetual succession and a common seal. It can sue and be sued by its name. The university is open to all persons irrespective of class or creed, but nothing may require the university to admit, to any course of study, a larger number of students than determined by the ordinances. Similarly nothing can prevent the university from meeting special provisions for admission of students belonging to Scheduled castes or Scheduled Tribes. The vice-chancellor is a full-time salaried officer who is appointed by the chancellor (the governor of U.P.) from the names submitted to him by a committee constituted in accordance with the provisions of the U.P. State Universities Act 1973. The departments are under the direct supervision of their appointed directors; each sub-department has a head. The incumbent head of the Department of Commerce, Sudhir Kumar Shukla, is a recipient of the prestigious Rajiv Gandhi National Award. He was co-author of a book written by Anurag Chaube, deputy librarian. The award was presented by the Hon'ble President of India for Computer Evam Suchna Prabandh. Prof. Shukla has been felicitated by the Uttar Pradesh Government on account of Hindi Diwas with a university-level prize for his contribution towards the promotion of Hindi as a primary language.

Dr. Bhagwandas Central Library Formerly known as Bhagwandas Swadhyaypith, the library was established in 1921 and later renamed the Dr. Bhagwandas Central Library. He was a renowned philosopher and the first vice chancellor of the university. Many stalwarts of the national movement, including Jawaharlal Nehru, Jamunalal Bajaj, Acharya J.B. Kripalani, Puroshottamdas Tandon, Rafi Ahmed Kidwai, Sampurnanand, Lal Bahadur Shastri, and Pandit Kamalapati Tripathi were closely associated with this library.

NAISDA was the subject of an ABC TV documentary From Dreamtime to Dance broadcast in 2002. Aboriginal Islander Dance Theatre (1976 to 1998) The first contemporary indigenous Australian dance company was the Aboriginal Islander Dance Theatre (AIDT). This company formed out of the Professional Development arm of NAISDA and was responsible for most performance requests of the organisation. AIDT toured nationally and internationally becoming known as Australia's most toured dance company for two years. When Indigenous community members decided that an Indigenous person should take over the reins of the organisation, the then Executive Officer, Carole Johnson decided to form a professional dance company outside NAISDA. AIDT remained a part of the NAISDA under the Artistic Direction from 1989 of Raymond D. Blanco, the first Indigenous person to lead a dance company in Australia. At the time Johnson cited the administrative burden of keeping the school together and driving the company forward as too much of a strain. AIDT disbanded following the departure of Blanco in 1998. Johnson's company went on to become Bangarra Dance Theatre.

It was bought by Hastings Corporation and converted into the Museum in 1928. In 1932 an extension was added to create an art gallery and house the Durbar Hall, part of an Indian palace built for the Indian and Colonial Exhibition of 1886. A store was added to the back of the building in similar style in 1988. A major refurbishment took place in 2006-7, funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund, which expanded the floor space by 40%, improved access and facilities and introduced environmental control and monitoring.

It was designed by Caspar Purdon Clarke and was built on-site by Mohammed Baksh and Mohammed Juma. Baksh and Juma were skilled woodcarvers brought over from the Punjab specially to do the wood carving required for the exhibition. During the exhibition, the hall was the Prince of Wales official reception pavilion. At the conclusion of the exhibition Thomas Brassey, 1st Earl Brassey bought parts of the Indian Court and had them remodelled and installed as an extension to his Park Lane house. It was removed from London by Thomas Brassey, 2nd Earl Brassey and gifted to Hastings in 1919.

Hastings Museum & Art Gallery launched Hastings Digital Museum in response. The digital museum aimed to \\"counter the increase in social isolation and loneliness that COVID-19 is likely to cause.\\" The digital museum ran across the museum's social media accounts on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram using #HastingsDigitalMuseum. Digital content was produced by the museum team and also by freelancers. Funding to do this came from the museum's core budget, funding from a local charity, Chalk Cliff Trust, and Arts Council England's Museums and Schools Programme. The digital museum produced a range of activities including immersive game experiences, community art projects and creative workshops. Each of the activities they produced focused on involving people and encouraged participation. Some of the activities now feature on other websites; Hastings Digital Quilt is on Art UK and the LGBTQ+ inspired zine activity is on The British Museum site. The museum also launched a contemporary collecting project to record peoples' everyday experiences of lockdown. Volunteers were asked \\"to write as much or as little as they want to each day, but to make an entry every day\\" sharing their daily activities and feelings. Over 120 people volunteered to record their experiences. They also invited local black and ethnic minority creatives to respond to George Floyd‚Äôs killing in the USA and the Black Lives Matter movement. The museum supported four creatives to respond and shared their work through the museum's social media accounts.

History The famous Syrian Booza in the Bakdash store In Al-Hamidiyah Souq The souq dates back to the Ottoman era, being built along the axis of the Roman route to the Temple of Jupiter around 1780 during the reign of Sultan Abdul Hamid I, and later extended during the reign of Sultan Abdul Hamid II. Nowadays it is one of the most popular shopping districts in Syria, being lined with hundreds of clothes emporiums, handicraft shops selling traditional crafts and jewelry, caf√©s, grocery stores, food stalls and ice cream parlors. Before the ongoing Syrian Civil War, it was one of Damascus's main attractions and was visited by many foreigners including Europeans and Gulf Arabs; however, it still remains a popular attraction between locals and Syrians. Although there have been many violent clashes around Damascus and in some of its neighborhoods, the souq has not been affected in any way by the ongoing war, although peaceful protests and demonstrations have taken place in the nearby Medhat Pasha Souq which extends from the Al Hamidiyah Souq.

Life  Jacob was born in 1372 in St≈ô√≠bro (called Mies in German and Misa in Latin) near Pilsen in Bohemia (present-day Czech Republic). He studied at the University of Prague, receiving both bachelor's and the master's degrees in theology, and became pastor of the Church of St. Michael and an outspoken supporter of Jan Hus. In 1410 he took part in the disputations regarding John Wycliffe, defending the latter against archiepiscopal condemnation. His study of Scripture and the Fathers led him to believe that withholding of the chalice in the administration of Holy Communion to the laity was an arbitrary measure of the Catholic Church. In 1414, he propounded and defended his views in a public disputation; and when Hus, at that time in jail at Konstanz, accepted them, he began to administer the chalice to his parishioners, in spite of the remonstrances of the bishop and the university. His example was quickly followed by other pastors in Prague. The Fathers of the Council of Constance (1415) issued a decree, explaining that reception of Holy Communion under both kinds was not necessary for salvation, though such reception in and of itself was not evil. What was at stake was not the inherent good or evil of the practice, but the practical implications such as irreverence toward, and misunderstandings about, Holy Communion. Though Jacob would by no means submit, he was not removed from his office, perhaps because in other points, as, for instance, in the doctrine of purgatory, he agreed with the Catholic Church. During the last decade of his life Jacob was regarded as one of the foremost of the Utraquist theologians. He died in Prague on 9 August 1429.

Uromodulin is the most abundant protein excreted in ordinary urine.  Gene  The human UMOD gene is located on chromosome 16. While several transcript variants may exist for this gene, the full-length natures of only two have been described to date. These two represent the major variants of this gene and encode the same isoform.  Protein  THP is a GPI-anchored glycoprotein. It is not derived from blood plasma but is produced by the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle of the mammalian kidney. While the monomeric molecule has a MW of approximately 85 kDa, it is physiologically present in urine in large aggregates of up to several million Da. When this protein is concentrated at low pH, it forms a gel. Uromodulin represents the most abundant protein in normal human urine (results based on MSMS determinations). It is the matrix of urinary casts derived from the secretion of renal tubular cells.  3D structure  A crystal structure of the precursor form of UMOD () was published in January 2016 by researchers at Karolinska Institutet, in collaboration with groups at San Raffaele Hospital and European Synchrotron Radiation Facility. The cryo-EM structure of native human UMOD, in its biologically active polymeric form (; ), was first reported in May 2020 by the same group at Karolinska Institutet, together with scientists at Nanyang Technological University and San Raffaele Hospital.  Function  Uromodulin excretion in urine follows proteolytic cleavage of the ectodomain of its glycophosphatidylinositol-anchored counterpart that is situated on the luminal cell surface of the loop of Henle. Uromodulin may act as a constitutive inhibitor of calcium crystallization in renal fluids. The excretion of uromodulin in urine may provide defense against urinary tract infections caused by uropathogenic bacteria. The function of THP is not well understood. Studies using THP deficient mice revealed that THP may have a role in regulatory physiology and actually participates in transporter function. A role in bacterial binding and sequestration is suggested by studies showing that Escherichia coli which express MS (mannose-sensitive) pili or fimbriae (also fimbria, from the Latin word for \\"fringe\\") can be trapped by Tamm‚ÄìHorsfall protein via its mannose-containing side chains. THP may also be important in protection from kidney injury by down-regulating inflammation.  Clinical significance  Uropontin, nephrocalcin and uromodulin (this protein) are the three known urinary glycoproteins that affect the formation of calcium-containing kidney stones or calculus. Tamm‚ÄìHorsfall protein is part of the matrix in renal calculi but a role in kidney stone formation remains debatable. However, decreased levels of Tamm‚ÄìHorsfall in urine have been found to be a good indicator of kidney stones. Defects in this gene are associated with the autosomal dominant renal disorders medullary cystic kidney disease-2 (MCKD2) and familial juvenile hyperuricemic nephropathy (FJHN). These disorders are characterized by juvenile onset of hyperuricemia, gout, and progressive kidney failure. Antibodies to Tamm‚ÄìHorsfall protein have been seen in various forms of nephritis (e.g., Balkan nephropathy), however, it remains unclear whether there is any pathophysiologic relevance to these findings. Another disease associated with mutations in this gene is Uromodulin- associated Kidney Disease (UKD), a rare autosomal dominant progressive failure of the kidneys. In multiple myeloma, there is often protein cast in the distal convoluted tubule and collecting duct of the kidneys, mainly consisting of immunoglobulin light chain known as Bence Jones protein, but often also contain Tamm‚ÄìHorsfall protein. This is known as myeloma cast nephropathy.  History  The glycoprotein was first purified in 1952 by Igor Tamm and Frank Horsfall from the urine of healthy individuals. It was later detected in the urine of all mammals studied.

Born to Benjamin B. and Mattie (Jones) Kimbell, he attended the public schools in Whitewright, Texas, but quit school in the eighth grade to work as an office boy in a grain-milling company there, where he later founded the Beatrice Milling Company. This firm grew into Kimbell Milling Company, the pilot organization of diverse interests that Kimbell later founded or directed. At the time of his death he was the head of more than seventy corporations, including flour, feed, and oil mills, grocery chains (Buddies, sold to Winn-Dixie but later closed when the chain left the DFW market), an insurance company, and a wholesale grocery firm. In addition to pursuing business interests, Kimbell collected art. He established the Kimbell Art Foundation in Fort Worth, Texas in 1935 and at his death left his fortune to the foundation, with directions to build a museum of the first class in Fort Worth. The collection of art that Kimbell and his wife amassed included many fine works by late Renaissance, French nineteenth-century, and American nineteenth-century artists, with a special emphasis on eighteenth- century English painters such as Reynolds and Gainsborough. The Kimbells' home in Fort Worth was often visited by touring groups before the museum was completed, and a great many of the works in their collection were continuously on loan to area colleges and universities, libraries, and churches. Kimbell married Velma Fuller on December 24, 1910; they had no children.

PopulationSights It is best known as the location of the Ch√¢teau de Chambord, one of the most recognisable ch√¢teaux in the world because of its very distinct French Renaissance architecture. The ch√¢teau forms a parallelogram flanked at the angles by round towers and enclosing a square block of buildings, the fa√ßade of which forms the centre of the main front. The profusion of turrets, pinnacles, and dormer windows which decorates the roof of this, the chief portion of the ch√¢teau, constitutes the main feature of the exterior, while in the interior are a well-preserved chapel of the 16th century and a famous double staircase, the construction of which permits two people to ascend and descend respectively without seeing one another. There are 440 apartments, containing pictures of the 17th century and souvenirs of the comte de Chambord. The ch√¢teau was originally a hunting-box of the counts of Blois, the rebuilding of which was begun by Francis I. in 1526, and completed under Henry II. It was the residence of several succeeding monarchs, and under Louis XIV. considerable alterations were made. In the same reign Moli√®re performed Monsieur de Pourceaugnac and Le Bourgeois gentilhomme for the first time in the theatre. Stanislaus, king of Poland, lived at Chambord, which was bestowed by his son-in-law, Louis XV., upon Marshal Saxe. It was given by Napoleon to Marshal Berthier, from whose widow it was purchased by subscription in 1821, and presented to the duc de Bordeaux, the representative of the older branch of the Bourbons, who assumed from it the title of comte de Chambord. On his death in 1883 it came by bequest into the possession of the family of Parma.

Biography=Early life Patti was born in Paris, France. She chose her artist name, Guesch, from the nickname she had as a child. Patti is a nickname for Patricia. Guesch Patti first started her career at dancing at age nine when she performed in a ballet at the Op√©ra National de Paris, working with Roland Petit, then at contemporary dance with Carolyn Carlson and Pina Bausch, and finally at variety dance on television. Music After having accompanied the pianist Yves Gilbert, she decided to start a singing career and recorded two discs in 1965 that passed unnoticed. In 1984, Patti participated in the trio named 'Dacapo', and had her first solo hit in 1987/1988 with \\"√âtienne\\", which was certified gold disc in France. This song sold more than half a million copies and was ranked #1 in several countries, including France and Italy. Labyrinthe, released a short time after, was also successful: in 1988, it won a Victoire de la Musique in the category 'Female r√©v√©lation of the year', which is awarded to best new artists. Another single, \\"Let Be Must the Queen\\", was a minor hit, peaking at #25 in France and #21 in Austria. Her second album, entitled Nomades, was released in January 1990. In spite of a European tour and concerts performed in the US and Canada, the album was less successful than the previous. \\"L'Homme au tablier vert\\", \\"Comment dire\\" and \\"Nomades\\" were the three singles from the album, but were not charted. In 1992, Patti released her third album, Gobe, which was critically well-received, but considered a commercial failure. In 1995, her next album, Blonde, strongly marked a musical shift and a more electronic experimentation, with less commercial sounds and new collaborations with many artists including √âtienne Daho (on the song \\"Blonde\\") and Fran√ßoise Hardy (\\"Un peu, beaucoup\\"). There were three singles from this album: \\"La Marquise\\", \\"Blonde,\\" and \\"Amn√©sie\\". In addition, the British filmmaker Peter Greenaway chose both \\"La Marquise\\" and \\"Blonde\\" for the soundtrack of his film The Pillow Book (1996). The fifth album, Derni√®res Nouvelles, released in 2000, highlighted a painful and romance-drama ambiance, strongly tinged with loneliness. A DVD released in March 2002 completed the album. With much musical innovation, this DVD presents a large part of the album, containing choreographed performances and a false interview dealing with existential problems and the condition of the artist. The same year, Patti recorded a duet with Gonzales for the single entitled \\"Dans tes yeux\\". Theatre and films Following the failure of these albums in the 1990s, Patti decided to abandon music and diversify her artistic experiences. She then continued her dancing career, especially with the show entitled Elle sourit aux larmes, presented at the Theatre des Abbesses in 2001 in which she performed dances from various contemporary choreographers including Odile Duboc, Daniel Larrieu and another specially written for her by Dominique Mercy. Patti also appeared in films. She made a brief appearance in Claude Lelouch's film Une pour toutes, and also played in Elles, by Luis Galvao Teles, alongside Miou-Miou, Marthe Keller, Marisa Berenson and Carmen Maura. She continued to go on stage, with plays such as L'Op√©ra de quat'sous, Les Monologues du vagin and J√©sus Camacho 404 284. During the summer of 2006, she was a member of the jury in Dancing Show, broadcast on France 2 in France.

Following a lengthy refurbishment programme by Northumberland County Council, Ovingham Bridge re-opened to vehicles on 5 September 2016. The vehicle bridge is a single track of reduced width for cars and light vans only. There is no footpath; pedestrians use the separate footbridge that runs alongside and with the same deck level. The centre piers are set wider, allowing the deck to spread and two vehicles can pass, although this is rare. No traffic controls are installed; drivers observe the far end and wait or enter the bridge using a set of unwritten rules that usually function well. History It was built in 1883 by the Ovingham Bridge Company and replaced the earlier ferry. The steel tubes are marked Dorman Long Middlesbrough, the firm that designed and built the Sydney Harbour Bridge and the Tyne Bridge. It was originally opened and operated as a toll bridge until 1945. The toll house has long since been demolished. It was located on the downstream side at the southern end of the bridge. In 1974 a footbridge was erected alongside, immediately downstream of the main bridge. In 2009 both bridges underwent a strengthening programme as they had been closed during the January floods of 2005. Gabions were installed around the base of the pilings to prevent scour, and the river channel was dredged to direct the main flow away from the piers. As the original piling depths were not recorded, brackets were welded to the pilings and seismic pulse testing performed. On 30 June 2014, the vehicle bridge was closed for extensive maintenance projected to take around 12 months. A small closing ceremony saw the last vehicle to cross ‚Äì a horse and cart ‚Äì as a reminder of the first vehicle to cross when it was originally opened. During May and June 2014, access trackways were built to the underside of both ends of the bridges, and extensive steel scaffolding installed below and to both sides of the bridge structure. The scaffolds even incorporated wooden boarded cutwaters to protect the scaffold if the river should flood. Lattice long span 'unit beams' were fitted to all spans except the North and South. Concrete pads were cast below the bridge end spans adjacent to the approach roads so that the spans could be jacked up. This was to allow extensive modification of the area where the steel bridge rests on the stone abutment. New concrete structures were cast as pier caps and compliant pads installed to allow the entire span to expand and contract with seasonal temperature changes. The bridge deck including cross beams were completely replaced. The footbridge was also due to be closed and have new decking. Pedestrians were redirected to use the main bridge whilst this was underway.

The AFCA is also responsible for the Top 25 poll for Division II and Division III football. The AFCA was founded in a meeting for 43 coaches at the Hotel Astor in New York City on Dec. 27, 1921. It is headquartered in Waco, Texas (the headquarters building is located across from Baylor University, formerly coached by AFCA executive director Grant Teaff). The association has over 10,000 members and represents coaches at all levels including the National Collegiate Athletic Association, the National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics, the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics, the National Junior College Athletic Association, the National Federation of State High School Associations, the National Football League, the Canadian Football League, USA Football, the National Football Foundation, College Football Hall of Fame, and Pop Warner Football. The AFCA is considered the primary professional association for football coaches at all levels of competition. Another primary goal of the American Football Coaches Association is the promotion of safety. The association has established a code of ethics and has made many safety recommendations. An annual injury survey begun by the AFCA in the 1930s has provided valuable data and has led to a remarkable reduction of injuries in the sport down through the years. The NCAA Rules Committee often follows recommendations made by the AFCA.  All-American Teams  Since 1945, the American Football Coaches Association has selected an All-American team. It is the only one selected exclusively by the coaches themselves. * See also: 2009 All-American team  AFCA National Championship Trophy  The AFCA National Championship Trophy is the trophy awarded by the American Football Coaches Association (AFCA) to the winner of college football's BCS National Championship Game, which determines the national champion for purposes of the Coaches Poll.

Tuss McLaughry, the award's namesake, began his coaching career at his alma mater, Westminster (Pa.) College in 1916. During his early days in coaching, McLaughry spent his spare time playing pro football with the Massillon (Ohio) Tigers. Knute Rockne was a teammate. He went on to become head coach at Amherst (1922‚Äì25), Brown (1926‚Äì40), and Dartmouth (1941‚Äì55). McLaughry retired from coaching in 1954, but continued in his capacity as chairman of the Physical Education Department at Dartmouth until 1960, when he accepted the appointment with the AFCA.

The hamlet is situated where the Little Stour and Great Stour rivers meet. Etymology The hamlet is named after a Dutch Drainage Engineer called Ploeg, whose grave is in All Saints Church, West Stourmouth. Ploeg, being the Dutch for a plough, the hamlet takes its origins from the Dutch Protestant tradition of draining marshland by creating a ploughed ditch. History A mile upstream from the Dog and Duck Inn public house is 'Blood Point', where King Alfred's defeated a Viking invasion force and often taken to be the Royal Navy's first successful engagement of a foe. During the Middle Ages, the two rivers met the Wantsum Channel at Stourmouth, but the combined rivers now (called the River Stour downstream from Plucks Gutter) flow onward to the sea via Sandwich to Pegwell Bay near Ramsgate, leaving Plucks Gutter six miles in a straight line and ten by river from the English Channel. In 1821-23, a North Kent Gang of smugglers used Pluck's Gutter. One account from a Revenue Officer stated they travelled fourteen miles on foot, through Trenleypark Wood to Stodmarsh, then via Grove Corner to Pluck's Gutter, where they crossed the river by the ferry, and onward north-east to Mount Pleasant near Acol, then to Marsh Bay ‚Äì the former name for what is modern-day Westgate-on-Sea. Amenities In the hamlet is a riverside inn with a holiday caravan and lodge park, and facilities for non-residential riverside moorings.The Dog and Duck caravan park Retrieved 2017-05-07 The old ferry cottage (an earlier public house), is the eponymous 'House at Plucks Gutter' and was the inspiration for the book of the same name by Manning Coles. The freeholder of the cottage has an obligation to provide services to any officer of one of 'His Majesty's Ships of War' lying in the Wantsum Channel as payment to the Crown for the rights to operate the ferry. Fishing on the river is controlled by the Wantsum Angling Association and Plucks Gutter is a location for fishing competitions; Pike, bream and roach are most commonly caught, with ducks, swans and kingfishers seen.

It comprises two adjacent shopping centres, the grade II listed building thecentre:mk which opened in 1979, and intu Milton Keynes (originally Midsummer Place) opened in 2000. The centre:mk is anchored by John Lewis, House of Fraser (closed 1 February 2020) and Marks and Spencer, with Debenhams (now closed) at intu Milton Keynes. The complex is the 14th largest shopping centre in the UK, with the size of 120,773 sq metres. Development The Milton Keynes Development Corporation began work on the Shopping Building in 1973. It was to be the largest building of Central Milton Keynes, and was built at the highest point in the \\"New City\\". The architects were Derek Walker, Stuart Mosscrop, and Christopher Woodward, who had been significant architects at the MK Development Corporation; and the engineers were Felix Samuely and Partners. The shopping area was opened on 25 September 1979 by the Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher., page 146 The building's sleek envelope accommodated 130 shops and six department stores, arranged along two parallel day-lit arcades, planted with sub-tropical and temperate trees.N. Pevsner and E. Williamson, Buckinghamshire, 2nd edition, Penguin Books (Buildings of England), 1994, , page 494. Architecture The cool, elegant, steel framed design was influenced by the architecture of Ludwig Mies van der RoheA lost vision of modernismOwen Hatherley writing in The Guardian, 16 July 2010 and echoed glazed shopping streets or arcades on the grand scale of the Galleria in Milan. The designer, Derek Walker, also likened it to the Crystal Palace.RIBA Journal, May 1979. It was described in 1993 as \\"still the best- looking if no longer the biggest shopping centre in the British Isles\\". It is unusual for second generation shopping centres in Europe for the amount of daylight allowed into the public areas, for the rigorous control of retail facias along the arcades themselves, for its public art, the unusually high level of accessibility for visitors with limited mobility (and other users laden with children and shopping), the lavish extent of the public spaces and their interior planting (reduced since the buildings was completed) and for the cool mirrored exterior. Public access to all units is flush and at ground level. Some of the shops e.g. John Lewis, Debenhams and Next have 2 or 3 floors inside. A service road for deliveries runs above the shops, so that large trucks may service the shops at roof level, removing the peripheral service roads and loading bays at ground level that mar so many large shopping malls. This means all deliveries take place out of view of the shoppers, though tall trucks can sometimes be seen from the arcades as they pass at high level. The internal landscaping was very lavish with 47 plant beds with large plants and trees; temperate in the northerly arcade and semi-tropical in the southerly one. The planters were finished in the same travertine as the floor, but approximately one third of these have been removed since the building was opened, with consequent loss of both planting and seating for shoppers, to accommodate market barrows and stalls. Fountain in Queen's Court before 2009/10 redevelopment There are two large public areas, intended as civic open spaces, one indoors and one open air.

During 2010, Middleton Hall was used as a temporary home venue for the Milton Keynes Lions basketball team, housing a 1,200-seat arena. In a central space outside the shopping building (but contained by it on three sides) is an open-air market, much of it under Secklow Gate (a flyover that gives first-floor service access to the shops' loading bays, as well as a useful North-South route). Extensions In 1993, the building was extended at the western end, over much of what had been City Square to the even greater length of 720 meters. In architectural style this extension is similar to the original, though the join can be detected internally by the low ceilings and dark corridors in the extension, quite unlike the handsome arcades of the original phase. Following extension this was documented in the 1997 Guinness Book of Records to contain the longest shopping mall in the world.The Guinness Book of Records 1997, Guinness Publishing, 1996, , page 165. intu Milton Keynes Oak Court in Midsummer Place, when a former oak tree was healthy. intu Milton Keynes (originally Midsummer Place) is effectively a southwards extension of the centre but is owned and operated independently. (It was a planning requirement that it should not physically attach to the original building, so there is an approximately one metre gap between them). Midsummer Place was designed by GMW Architects of London and opened in 2000. This extension is built across (and thus closing) Midsummer Boulevard using a (covered and enclosed) plaza that contains some demountable kiosks: it is a further planning requirement that the Boulevard should technically be capable of being reopened (remain free of structures) at some future date.

The building was also used as a location for still photography on the first self-titled album by Duran Duran. Grade II listing for original building In November 2008, English Heritage (the Government's advisor on historic buildings) recommended to the Culture Minister that the original building be designated a \\"II*\\" listed building which, the owners say, would curtail severely their ability to alter it if awarded.Milton Keynes centre may become architectural 'treasure'.

The primary coil in the charger induces a current in the secondary coil in the device being charged. Wireless charging pad used to charge devices with the Qi standard. Inductive charging (also known as wireless charging or cordless charging) is a type of wireless power transfer. It uses electromagnetic induction to provide electricity to portable devices. The most common application is the Qi wireless charging standard for smartphones, smartwatches and tablets. Inductive charging is also used in vehicles, power tools, electric toothbrushes and medical devices. The portable equipment can be placed near a charging station or inductive pad without needing to be precisely aligned or make electrical contact with a dock or plug. Energy is transferred through inductive coupling. An alternating current is run through an induction coil in the charging station or pad (the primary or transmission coil.) Any moving electric charge creates a magnetic field, as stated by Oersted's law. The magnetic field fluctuates in strength as the AC current is continually changing amplitude. A changing magnetic field generates an electromotive force otherwise known as Faraday's law of induction. This makes an alternating electric current in a second induction coil (the receiving, or secondary coil) in the portable device. It is then converted to direct current with a rectifier and used to charge a battery or provide operating power.Wireless charging: The state of disunion Greater distances between sender and receiver coils can be achieved when the inductive charging system uses resonant inductive coupling, where a capacitor is added to each induction coil to create two LC circuits with a specific resonance frequency. The frequency of the alternating current is matched with the resonance frequency, and the frequency chosen depending on the distance desired for peak efficiency. Recent improvements to this resonant system include using a movable transmission coil (i.e., mounted on an elevating platform or arm) and the use of other materials for the receiver coil such as silver-plated copper or sometimes aluminum to minimize weight and decrease resistance due to the skin effect. History Induction power transfer was first used in 1894 when M. Hutin and M. Le-Blanc proposed an apparatus and method to power an electric vehicle. However, combustion engines proved more popular, and this technology was forgotten for a time. In 1972, Professor Don Otto of the University of Auckland proposed a vehicle powered by induction using transmitters in the road and a receiver on the vehicle. In 1977, John E. Trombly was awarded a patent for an \\"Electromagnetically coupled battery charger.\\" The patent describes an application to charge headlamp batteries for miners (US 4031449). The first application of inductive charging used in the United States was performed by J.G. Bolger, F.A. Kirsten, and S. Ng in 1978. They made an electric vehicle powered with a system at 180 Hz with 20 kW. In California in the 1980s, a bus was produced, which was powered by inductive charging, and similar work was being done in France and Germany around this time. In 2006, MIT began using resonant coupling. They were able to transmit a large amount of power without radiation over a few meters. This proved to be better for commercial needs, and it was a major step for inductive charging. The Wireless Power Consortium (WPC) was established in 2008, and in 2010 they established the Qi standard. In 2012, the Alliance for Wireless Power (A4WP) and the Power Matter Alliance (PMA) were founded. Japan established Broadband Wireless Forum (BWF) in 2009, and they established the Wireless Power Consortium for Practical Applications (WiPoT) in 2013. The Energy Harvesting Consortium (EHC) was also founded in Japan in 2010. Korea established the Korean Wireless Power Forum (KWPF) in 2011. The purpose of these organizations is to create standards for inductive charging. In 2018, The Qi Wireless Standard was adopted for use in military equipment in North Korea, Russia and Germany Application areas Applications of inductive charging can be divided into two broad categories: Low power and high power: * Low power applications are generally supportive of small consumer electronic devices such as cell phones, handheld devices, some computers, and similar devices which normally charge at power levels below 100 watts. * High power inductive charging generally refers to inductive charging of batteries at power levels above 1 kilowatt. The most prominent application area for high power inductive charging is in support of electric vehicles, where inductive charging provides an automated and cordless alternative to plug-in charging. Power levels of these devices can range from approximately 1 kilowatt to 300 kilowatts or higher. All high power inductive charging systems use resonated primary and secondary coils. Advantages * Protected connections ‚Äì No corrosion when the electronics are enclosed, away from water or oxygen in the atmosphere. Less risk of electrical faults such as short circuit due to insulation failure, especially where connections are made or broken frequently. * Low infection risk ‚Äì For embedded medical devices, transmission of power via a magnetic field passing through the skin avoids the infection risks associated with wires penetrating the skin.‚ÄúWireless Power For Medical Devices.‚Äù MDDI Online, 7 Aug. 2017, www.mddionline.com/wireless-power- medical-devices. * Durability ‚Äì Without the need to constantly plug and unplug the device, there is significantly less wear and tear on the socket of the device and the attaching cable. * Increased convenience and aesthetic quality ‚Äì No need for cables. * Automated high power inductive charging of electric vehicles allows for more frequent charging events and consequently an extension of driving range. * Inductive charging systems can be operated automatically without dependence on people to plug and unplug. This results in higher reliability. * Automatic operation of inductive charging solves this problem, theoretically allowing the vehicle to run indefinitely. * Inductive charging of electric vehicles at high power levels enables charging of electric vehicles while in motion (also known as dynamic charging). Disadvantages The following disadvantages have been noted for low power (i.e., less than 100 watts) inductive charging devices. These disadvantages may not be applicable to high power (i.e. greater than 5 kilowatts) electric vehicle inductive charging systems. * Slower charging ‚Äì Due to the lower efficiency, devices take 15 percent longer to charge when supplied power is the same amount. * More expensive ‚Äì Inductive charging also requires drive electronics and coils in both device and charger, increasing the complexity and cost of manufacturing. * Inconvenience ‚Äì When a mobile device is connected to a cable, it can be moved around (albeit in a limited range) and operated while charging. In most implementations of inductive charging, the mobile device must be left on a pad to charge, and thus can't be moved around or easily operated while charging. With some standards, charging can be maintained at a distance, but only with nothing present between the transmitter and receiver. * Compatible standards ‚Äì Not all devices are compatible with different inductive chargers. However, some devices have started to support multiple standards. * Inefficiency ‚Äì Inductive charging is not as efficient as direct charging, causing greater heat production when compared to conventional charging. Continued exposure to heat can result in battery damage.‚ÄúReview: the joys of smartphone wireless chargers.‚Äù Financial Times, http://www.ft.com/content/871843e8-aa78-11e7-93c5-648314d2c72c. An analysis of energy use found that charging a Pixel 4 from 0 to 100 percent on a classic cable used 14.26 Wh (watt-hours), while doing so with a wireless charger took 21.01 Wh, a 47 percent increase. For a single phone and a single charger this is a very small amount of energy, but at scale it could pose serious problems; if the 3.5 billion smartphones in service all took 50 percent more power to get a charge, the impact would be enormous. It‚Äôs estimated it takes the equivalent of 73 50-MW coal plants running for a day to fully charge 3.5 billion smartphones, so any increased popularity of wireless charging in the absence of serious efficiency gains isn‚Äôt a great trade-off for an incredibly mild convenience. Newer approaches reduce transfer losses through the use of ultra thin coils, higher frequencies, and optimized drive electronics. This results in more efficient and compact chargers and receivers, facilitating their integration into mobile devices or batteries with minimal changes required. These technologies provide charging times comparable to wired approaches, and they are rapidly finding their way into mobile devices. For example, the Magne Charge vehicle recharger system employs high-frequency induction to deliver high power at an efficiency of 86% (6.6 kW power delivery from a 7.68 kW power draw). Standards Standards refer to the different set operating systems with which devices are compatible. There are two main standards: Qi and PMA. The two standards operate very similarly, but they use different transmission frequencies and connection protocols. Because of this, devices compatible with one standard are not necessarily compatible with the other standard. However, there are devices compatible with both standards. *Magne Charge, a largely obsolete inductive charging system, also known as J1773, used to charge battery electric vehicles (BEV) formerly made by General Motors. * The emerging SAE J2954 standard allows inductive car charging over a pad, with power delivery up to 11 kW. * Qi, an interface standard developed by the Wireless Power Consortium for inductive electrical power transfer. At the time of July 2017, it is the most popular standard in the world, with more than 200 million devices supporting this interface. * AirFuel Alliance: ** In January 2012, the IEEE announced the initiation of the Power Matters Alliance (PMA) under the IEEE Standards Association (IEEE-SA) Industry Connections. The alliance is formed to publish set of standards for inductive power that are safe and energy efficient, and have smart power management. The PMA will also focus on the creation of an inductive power ecosystem ** Rezence was an interface standard developed by the Alliance for Wireless Power (A4WP). ** A4WP and PMA merged into the AirFuel Alliance in 2015. *ISO 15118 for Vehicle to Grid communication (related standard) In modern smartphones Samsung Galaxy Note 10 smartphones have \\"Wireless PowerShare\\" technology Many manufacturers of smartphones have started adding this technology into their devices, the majority adopting the Qi wireless charging standard. Major manufacturers such as Apple and Samsung produce many models of their phones in high volume with Qi capabilities. The popularity of the Qi standard has driven other manufacturers to adopt this as their own standard. Smartphones have become the driving force of this technology entering consumers‚Äô homes, where many household technologies have been developed to utilize this technology. Samsung and other companies have begun exploring the idea of \\"surface charging\\", building an inductive charging station into an entire surface such as a desk or table. Contrarily, Apple and Anker are pushing a dock-based charging platform. This includes charging pads and disks that have a much smaller footprint. These are geared for consumers who wish to have smaller chargers that would be located in common areas and blend in with the current d√©cor of their home. Due to the adoption of the Qi standard of wireless charging, any of these chargers will work with any phone as long as the phone is Qi capable. Another developement is reverse wireless charging, which allows a mobile phone to wirelessly discharge its own battery into another device. Examples iPhone X being charged by a wireless charger. * Oral-B rechargeable toothbrushes by the Braun company have used inductive charging since the early 1990s. * At the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in January 2007, Visteon unveiled its inductive charging system for in- vehicle use that could charge only specially made cell phones to MP3 players with compatible receivers. * April 28, 2009: An Energizer inductive charging station for the Wii remote was reported on IGN. * At CES in January 2009, Palm, Inc. announced its new Pre smartphone would be available with an optional inductive charger accessory, the \\"Touchstone\\". The charger came with a required special backplate that became standard on the subsequent Pre Plus model announced at CES 2010. This was also featured on later Pixi, Pixi Plus, and Veer 4G smartphones. Upon launch in 2011, the ill-fated HP Touchpad tablet (after HP's acquisition of Palm Inc.) had a built in touchstone coil that doubled as an antenna for its NFC-like Touch to Share feature. * March 24, 2013: Samsung launched the Galaxy S3, which supports an optionally retrofittable back cover accessory, included in their separate ‚ÄúWireless Charging Kit‚Äù. * Nokia announced on September 5, 2012, the Lumia 920 and Lumia 820, which supports respectively integrate inductive charging and inductive charging with an accessory back. * March 15, 2013 Samsung launched the Galaxy S4, which supports inductive charging with an accessory back cover. * July 26, 2013 Google and ASUS launched the Nexus 7 2013 Edition with integrated inductive charging. * September 9, 2014 Apple announced Apple Watch (released on April 24, 2015), which uses wireless inductive charging. * September 12, 2017 Apple announced the AirPower wireless charging mat. It was meant to be capable of charging an iPhone, an Apple Watch and AirPods simultaneously; the product however was never released. On September 12, 2018 Apple removed most mentions of the AirPower from its website and on March 29, 2019 it cancelled the product completely. *iN2POWER, a Belgian technology innovator introduced in 2017 a family of 1.1 to 16 kW (combinable up to 48 kW) \\"plug&play;\\" wireless charging systems based on high density induction for AGVs, drones, medical (cleanroom) and naval applications. These system charges batteries (regardless of type) from 30A to 750A with min.95% efficiency. By end 2019 more than 1500 units are integrated in AGVs. *In 2018 the German company Wiferion presented a 3KW wireless charging system for industrial application such as AGV charging.The system claims to have the best efficiency in class of an overall transfer efficiency of >92%. ;Qi devices * Nokia launched two smartphones (the Lumia 820 and Lumia 920) on 5 September 2012, which feature Qi inductive charging. * Google and LG launched the Nexus 4 in October 2012 which supports inductive charging using the Qi standard. * Motorola Mobility launched its Droid 3 and Droid 4, both optionally support the Qi standard. * On November 21, 2012 HTC launched the Droid DNA, which also supports the Qi standard. * October 31, 2013 Google and LG launched the Nexus 5, which supports inductive charging with Qi. *April 14, 2014 Samsung launched the Galaxy S5 that supports Qi wireless charging with either a wireless charging back or receiver. *November 20, 2015 Microsoft launched the Lumia 950 XL and Lumia 950 which support charging with the Qi standard. *February 22, 2016 Samsung announced its new flagship Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge which use an interface that is almost the same as Qi.

Research and other * Transcutaneous Energy Transfer (TET) systems in artificial hearts and other surgically implanted devices. * In 2006, researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology reported that they had discovered an efficient way to transfer power between coils separated by a few meters. The team, led by Marin Soljaƒçiƒá, theorized that they could extend the distance between the coils by adding resonance to the equation. The MIT inductive power project, called WiTricity, uses a curved coil and capacitive plates. MIT team experimentally demonstrates inductive power transfer, potentially useful for powering laptops, cell phones without cords. * In 2012 a Russian private museum Grand Maket Rossiya opened featuring inductive charging on its model car exhibits. * As of 2017, Disney Research has been developing and researching room scale inductive charging for multiple devices. Transportation=Electric vehicles Electric car wireless parking charge closeup, 2011 Tokyo Motor Show. 200kW Charging-Pad for Busses, 2020 Bombardier Transportation. * Hughes Electronics developed the Magne Charge interface for General Motors. The General Motors EV1 electric car was charged by inserting an inductive charging paddle into a receptacle on the vehicle. General Motors and Toyota agreed on this interface and it was also used in the Chevrolet S-10 EV and Toyota RAV4 EV vehicles. *September 2015 AUDI Wireless Charging (AWC) presented a 3.6 kW inductive charger during the 66th International Motor Show (IAA) 2015. *September 17, 2015 Bombardier-Transportation PRIMOVE presented a 3.6 kW Charger for cars, which was developed at Site in Mannheim Germany. *Transport for London has introduced inductive charging in a trial for double-decker buses in London. * Magne Charge inductive charging was employed by several types of electric vehicles around 1998, but was discontinued after the California Air Resources Board selected the SAE J1772-2001, or \\"Avcon\\", conductive charging interface for electric vehicles in California in June 2001. *In 1997 Conductix Wampler started with wireless charging in Germany, In 2002 20 buses started in operation In Turin with 60 kW charging. In 2013 the IPT technology was bought by Proov. In 2008 the technology was already used in the house of the future in Berlin with Mercedes A Class. Later Evatran also began development of Plugless Power, an inductive charging system it claims is the world's first hands-free, plugless, proximity charging system for Electric Vehicles. With the participation of the local municipality and several businesses, field trials were begun in March 2010. The first system was sold to Google in 2011 for employee use at the Mountain View campus. *Evatran began selling the Plugless L2 Wireless charging system to the public in 2014. * January 2019: Volvo Group‚Äòs subsidiary Volvo Group Venture Capital announced investment in U.S.-based wireless charging specialist Momentum Dynamics.Volvo is interested in wireless charging. *BRUSA Elektronik AG, a specialist provider and development company for electric vehicles, offers a wireless charging module named ICS with 3.7 kW power. *A partnership between Cabonline, Jaguar, Momentum Dynamics, and Fortam Recharge are launching a wireless charging taxi fleet in Oslo, Norway. The fleet consists of 25 Jaguar I-Pace SUVs equipped with inductive charging pads rated at 50-75 kW. The pads use resonant inductive coupling operating at 85 Hz to improve wireless charging efficiency and range. Research and otherStationary= In one inductive charging system, one winding is attached to the underside of the car, and the other stays on the floor of the garage. The major advantage of the inductive approach for vehicle charging is that there is no possibility of electric shock, as there are no exposed conductors, although interlocks, special connectors and RCDs (ground fault interruptors, or GFIs) can make conductive coupling nearly as safe. An inductive charging proponent from Toyota contended in 1998 that overall cost differences were minimal, while a conductive charging proponent from Ford contended that conductive charging was more cost efficient. From 2010 onwards car makers signalled interest in wireless charging as another piece of the digital cockpit. A group was launched in May 2010 by the Consumer Electronics Association to set a baseline for interoperability for chargers. In one sign of the road ahead a General Motors executive is chairing the standards effort group. Toyota and Ford managers said they also are interested in the technology and the standards effort. Daimler's Head of Future Mobility, Professor Herbert Kohler, however have expressed caution and said the inductive charging for EVs is at least 15 years away (from 2011) and the safety aspects of inductive charging for EVs have yet to be looked into in greater detail. For example, what would happen if someone with a pacemaker is inside the vehicle? Another downside is that the technology requires a precise alignment between the inductive pick up and the charging facility. In November 2011, the Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, and Qualcomm announced a trial of 13 wireless charging points and 50 EVs in the Shoreditch area of London's Tech City, due to be rolled out in early 2012. In October 2014, the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, Utah added an electric bus to its mass transit fleet that uses an induction plate at the end of its route to recharge. UTA, the regional public transportation agency, plans to introduce similar buses in 2018. In November 2012 wireless charging was introduced with 3 buses in Utrecht, The Netherlands. January 2015, eight electric buses were introduced to Milton Keynes, England, which uses inductive charging in the road with proov/ipt technology at either end of the journey to prolong overnight charges., Later bus routes in Bristol, London and Madrid followed. =Dynamic= Researchers at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) have developed an electric transport system (called Online Electric Vehicle, OLEV) where the vehicles draw power from cables underneath the surface of the road via non-contact magnetic charging (where a power source is placed underneath the road surface and power is wirelessly picked up on the vehicle itself). As a possible solution to traffic congestion and to improve overall efficiency by minimizing air resistance and so reduce energy consumption, the test vehicles followed the power track in a convoy formation. In July 2009 the researchers successfully supplied up to 60% power to a bus over a gap of . Commercialization efforts of the technology have not been successful because of high costs.  Medical implications  Wireless charging is making an impact in the medical sector by means of being able to charge implants and sensors long term that are located beneath the skin. Researchers have been able to print wireless power transmitting antenna on flexible materials that could be placed under the skin of patients. This could mean that under skin devices that could monitor the patient status could have a longer term life and provide long observation or monitoring periods that could lead to better diagnosis from doctors. These devices may also make charging devices like pacemakers easier on the patient rather than having an exposed portion of the device pushing through the skin to allow corded charging. This technology would allow a completely implanted device making it safer for the patient. It is unclear if this technology will be approved for use - more research is needed on the safety of these devices. While these flexible polymers are safer than ridged sets of diodes they can be more susceptible to tearing during either placement or removal due to the fragile nature of the antenna that is printed on the plastic material. While these medical based applications seem very specific the high speed power transfer that is achieved with these flexible antennas is being looked at for larger broader applications.  Research and development for vehicles  Work and experimentation is currently underway in designing this technology to be applied to electric vehicles. This could be implemented by using a predefined path or conductors that would transfer power across an air gap and charge the vehicle on a predefined path such as a wireless charging lane. Vehicles that could take advantage of this type of wireless charging lane to extend the range of their on board batteries are already on the road. Some of the issues that are currently preventing these lanes from becoming widespread is the initial cost associated with installing this infrastructure that would benefit only a small percentage of vehicles currently on the road. Another complication is tracking how much power each vehicle was consuming/pulling from the lane. Without a commercial way to monetize this technology, many cities have already turned down plans to include these lanes in their public works spending packages. However this doesn't mean that cars are unable to utilize large scale wireless charging. The first commercial steps are already being taken with wireless mats that allow electric vehicles to be charged without a corded connection while parked on a charging mat. These large scale projects have come with some issues which include the production of large amounts of heat between the two charging surfaces and may cause a safety issue. Currently companies are designing new heat dispersion methods by which they can combat this excess heat. These companies include most major electric vehicle manufacturers, such as Tesla, Toyota, and BMW.

The movie's title and plot is a reference to the classic Akira Kurosawa film, the Seven Samurai. This movie marks the debut of Kamen Rider Hibiki's final form prior to its appearance in the show, and also explains the history of the Makamou and Oni war. The film was produced by Ishinomori Productions and Toei, the producers of all the previous television series and films under the Kamen Rider franchise. Following the tradition of all Heisei Kamen Rider movies, it is a double bill with 2005's Super Sentai movie, Mahou Sentai Magiranger: The Bride of Infershia. This was the first of the Heisei era Kamen Rider movies to not have a two word subtitle. This movie also served to introduce the new producer and writer team that would later go on to replace producer Shigenori Takatera and writer Tsuyoshi Kida within the main series.. Plot Hibiki and Asumu are on their way to a Makamou attack on the beach. Once they arrive there, they see dozens of people running from the massive Orochi, a beast rumored to be the strongest Makamou ever created. Once they arrive, Hibiki walks towards the Orochi and transforms, but all of his attacks prove useless against Orochi. The situation is made even more dire when Hibiki jumps in the way of an attack meant for Asumu. Taking the full force of the attack, Hibiki passes out as the Orochi swims away, leaving a panicking Asumu to get help. Hibiki ends up in the hospital and Asumu begins blaming himself for Hibiki's injuries. Feeling useless, he begins helping at Tachibana's, going through dozens of books to try to discover a way to defeat the Orochi. Upon coming across a book with his name on it, Asumu sits down and begins to read what turns out to be the history of Takeshi, the Oni and the Makamou war. In the Sengoku period, a young boy who has the same resemblance and name as Asumu is wandering around with his childhood friend Hitoe. In this time, the humans all knew and feared the Makamou, sometimes forced to sacrifice one of their own to spare an entire village from the Makamou's wrath. Suzu was such a case as she was offered up as the yearly sacrifice to the Orochi to keep it from killing the villagers. After some protesting from the girl's father, the man was killed by Douji and Hime before Suzu and her father's corpse were consumed by the Orochi. A year later, a mark appears upon Hitoe's hand, making her as the next sacrifice to the Orochi. Asumu, unwilling to let her meet such a fate, sets out to find a way to stop it. Meeting the village elder Tobei and the others for such a means, learning the only way is to bring an Oni, though many villagers see them to be no different than the Makamou, despite the fact that they fight the monsters. Asumu understands the danger but insists on setting out in spite his own history with an Oni. Tobei sends along his daughters, Kazue and Hinako, to help. The group then enters a town being attacking by a Makamou called Kaendaishou before it is defeated by an Oni named Kabuki who has been hired by the town's people to defeat the Makamou. After realizing that the people can only pay him with food, Kabuki offered some a younger boy, but the boy's mother quickly slaps the food away from the boy due to the taboo of humans' contact with the Oni. Learning of Asamu's blight, Kabuki offers his aid after telling him they need to gather allies to help them against the Orochi. To that end, Kabuki takes Asumu's group to find a small home where a former Oni named Hibiki lives. Asumu instantly declares his hatred for this man as he believes him to be the one that killed his brother. Asumu's older brother, Takeshi, was the apprentice to Hibiki and was killed one day in a rock slide. Asumu found Hibiki carrying his brother's body and assumed that Hibiki was his brother's killer. Without Hibiki, the group moves on to find the next Oni; Ibuki. They find Ibuki, who aided in the war and became daimy≈ç. But bored with his life as a feudal lord, Ibuki quickly takes care of his court and leaves with the group. The group then heads on to a small temple, where they recruit a buddhist priest named Touki after Kabuki attempted to throws a rock at him to test his buddhist abilities. The Oni then try to trick the Makamou by setting Ibuki up as the sacrifice in Hitoe's place. After finding out it was all a trick, the Makamou then attack Ibuki, who is quickly aided by Kabuki and Touki, the latter making quick work of the couple with his freezing power. But the Orochi then shows up and forces the Oni to leave the battle as the Douji and Hime threaten the villagers for their attempted defiance by giving them a month to redeem themselves or suffer the plague that they have inflicted on the girl. After Kirameki arrives too late for the fight, the group sets out to gain more partners. As the Douji and Hime discuss how to deal with their eventual meddling, the Oni group make a stop in a village, with Asumu following them until he is attacked by a group of Samurai and unknowingly being saved by Hibiki. The group then learn of Nishiki, the Oni thief who is to be executed for his crimes. The group comes to witness his public beheading, but Nishiki surprises everyone by catching the sword to be used in his beheading with his teeth. He then escapes and joins the group, who are being watched by a young girl that turns out to be a Makamou named Hitotsumi who specializes in killing Oni. The Oni then find Habataki, who first refuses to join them now that he has a wife and son. However, Habataki agrees to join the group only after his wife persuades him to take up the cause again as long as he returns to her alive. While they are traveling, they find Todoroki being attacked by Bakegani. Nishiki, Habataki and Kirameki help him dispatching the Oni before he tells them that Hibiki sent him to help them out. Back at Asumu's village, Hitoe illness worsens as she has gone to a cave to hide, with a group of villagers looking for her as the Oni returned. The villagers are found murdered later, with Nishiki's weapon at the scene. The house where the Oni are staying is then burnt down, and the Oni are told by the villagers that Nishiki's weapon was found at the sight of the murders and Hitoe saw the murderer to be an Oni. The group of Oni then get into a fight over the situation if they should fight back against the humans or not, but the fight is broken up once Hibiki comes along. It is then revealed to Asumu that Hibiki did not kill his brother, and that his brother was crafting a special sword for him. Hitoe is then brought home, identifying Kabuki as the one who killed the villagers and left Nishiki's weapon there to frame him. Though Hibiki and Asumu were confused, Kabuki reveals his intentions as he and Kaendaishou attack Hibiki, the two get away without Hitoe. The group of Oni then break up and head their own ways, but before doing so, Todoroki returns Hibiki's tuning fork and Disc Animals to him. While this occurred, before taken to be sacrificed, Hitoe takes Asamu to the cave he and brother played, finding a katana that Takeshi made for Hibiki before his death. Asumu makes his way to Hibiki as Kabuki ambushes him at his home, handing Hibiki the katana and asking him to fight for the memory of his brother. Taking the request to heart, Hibiki transforms and fends off Kabuki after killing Kaendaishou. After a long battle Hibiki, defeats Kabuki as he and Asumu make their way to the beach as Hitotsumi devours Kabuki. Arriving, Hibiki begins fighting with a massive group of Ninja Makamou as Asumu saves Hitoe. But outnumbered, the tie turns when the other Oni arrive to help Hibiki, killing Hitotsumi and the Douji/Hime pair. The battle goes on until Hibiki comes head to head with the Orochi. At the climax of the battle, the katana is swiped away from Hibiki's hands and into the sea. In the present, Asumu sees that the last page to the book is missing and not showing how that battle ended. Asumu then finds out that Hibiki is well and fighting the Orochi again. Sensing a presence in the nearby cave, Asumu finds the katana from the story he read and hands it to Hibiki, changing into the Armed Saber as he becomes Armed Hibiki and defeats the Orochi. In the past, in aftermath of their win over the Makamou army, Hibiki and the other Oni take their leave to be of service elsewhere. As the villagers rebuild their home, they decide that a human and Oni partnership would be best for both sides in the future, with Asumu naming this group \\"Takeshi\\", honoring the memory of his brother. Characters=TV Series (Present) *Hibiki / Kamen Rider Hibiki - Plays the same role as in the TV series. Hibiki is greatly injured at the start of the movie. *Asumu Adachi - Plays the same role as in the TV series. He was saved by Hibiki when they faced a Makamou which causes Hibiki being injured. This leads Asumu in reading the book that contains the history of the said Makamou and entangled with the history of TAKESHI and the Oni. Learning that his meeting with the Oni is no mere coincidence. Past These characters possess a resemblance to the present-time characters. *Hibiki - The original Hibiki is a quiet man. After blaming himself for Takeshi's death, he gave up being an Oni. *Ibuki - The original Ibuki played a role in the war that gave him a position as daimy≈ç. However, he become bored with his new position over time, setting out with the group searching for adventure as an Oni. *Todoroki - The Todoroki of the past is a carpenter Oni with no real master. The group suddenly met him on the way. *Asumu - Bearing a likeness to the Asumu of the present, he was the reason of the Oni gathering to defeat the Orochi. He is also one of the founding members of TAKESHI. Movie Edition OniKamen Rider Kabuki= Kabuki is a Taiko Oni and is one of the antagonists in the movie, having double-crossed Asumu and the others into believing he cares for humans (as per his staged fight with a Makamou). He also caused trouble among the seven Oni when they were accused of attacking humans (with Nishiki's weapons found beside a murdered man, while it was actually him who committed it). He revealed that he was disillusioned with his relation with humans because no matter how hard he fights and risks his life for them, they just call him an Oni, a monster, an animal. Thus he forms a pact with the Makamou to become one of them. He has a soft spot, however, for children because even upon his defeat by Hibiki and death at the hands of Hitotsumi, he pleads for Asumu's safety. =Kamen Rider Touki= A buddhist monk who spends his days praying at a local temple until Asumu and his group come upon him. He bears a resemblance to the present day Kamen Rider Zanki. =Kamen Rider Kirameki= Kirameki was Touki's partner years ago until an incident with an Ittanmomen resulted with Kirameki running off, leaving Touki to fend the Makamou off on his own. As a result, Kirameki was labeled a coward no one wanted to associated with. However, Kirameki joins the group of Oni when he arrives in his kite and suggests getting more reinforcements. =Kamen Rider Nishiki= A thief Oni who loves money, Nishiki is often caught in situations leading people to believe he is a criminal. He refused to join the Oni group at first until tricked in believing there's buried treasure in the village they're saving. =Kamen Rider Habataki= Habataki is one of the older Oni. He fought in a war years ago and has since given up the Oni life to settle down as a farmer together with his family.

Takeshi  While the movie's version of how Hibiki became Armed Hibiki and gained the Armed Saber is different of that than the television series, the rest of the movie is considered to be canon. Much of the history of the Makamou and Oni was only mentioned in small dialogue in the television series. It was not until the movie was released that the true heritage of the partnership between the Oni and the humans was revealed, as well as the history of the war between the Makamou and the Oni. It is believed that the Makamou history was simply written off as myths by modern-day humans. Thus, they are unaware of the existence of the Oni and Makamou.

The show was created by Roy Ward Dickson, who invented many game shows. Gameplay A word association game, the aim was to get your partner to say a particular word by giving them single word clues. For example, one partner might offer the clue \\"headgear\\" to describe the word \\"hat\\". 20 points were given for a word solved on the first clue, 15 points scored for a word solved in two clues and 10 points were awarded for a word solved on the third attempt. After three clues, the opponents had a shot at the word for 5 points. After a certain number of words, the team with the highest score became the champions and won money. Teams could win up to 6 times before being forced to retire. Ken and Christine Rowland were the only couple to receive full marks having given the correct answers after each first clue word. However, some of their clues, e.g. \\"Schneider\\" to produce the answer \\"trophy\\", clearly worried Ray Alan and they were not invited back like other winners. Some contestants would make it a bit harder for their opponents, by inserting references that would only mean something to them, for example, one would say some girl's name and the other would reply \\"Nurse\\" and get it right (someone they know with that name is a nurse) or give three personal references that the other partner got wrong, leaving the opposing team to figure out the right answer from just three personal names - the answer being some kind of occupation (relatives and friends of the first couple with those names being in that job). One thing that contestants were not allowed to do was to give 'sounds like' words as clues - the word concerned would be disallowed if they did so.

He was born in Aberdeen and educated at Charterhouse and Christ Church, Oxford. He took early retirement from his job as a teacher of English at Winchester College in 2011 and moved to Ely with his wife, the poet Wendy Cope. His output to date includes five collections of poetry, two critical studies and a biography. He also reviews regularly for, among others, The Times Literary Supplement. Style of poetry Critics have identified the influence of the American poet Robert Lowell in Mackinnon's first two collections, Monterey Cypress and The Coast of Bohemia, published within three years of one another. His third collection, The Jupiter Collisions, contains, among others, two sequence-poems, and has among its subjects retrospective contemplation of the author's childhood and adolescence, both in personal details and in the context of the 'Sixties (rock music, space travel, Minimalist art). One of his most famous papers includes 'prime numbers'. The collection also affords a small number of poems in sonnet form, despite the poet's tendency towards vers-libre, thereby combining the legacy of Lowell with that of W. H. Auden. In 2010 he published Small Hours with Faber. This includes \\"The Book of Emma\\", a long poem addressed to a dead friend and written largely in prose. The volume was short-listed for the Forward Prize in 2010. He also contributed to the Bush Theatre's 2011 project Sixty Six Books for which he wrote a piece based upon a book of the King James Bible He received a Cholmondeley Award in 2011.

It shared the Peggy Ramsay Award for 1997, was first performed at the Royal Exchange Theatre, Manchester in 1998, and has since been staged by a number of other companies worldwide. It was published in Plays One, a collection of Stephenson's plays published in 2002. Plot summary The plot takes place in the same house in two different time periods divided by the gap of two hundred years (1799 and 1999). The play questions the basic principles of scientific (medical) research, such as the right of the scientist to cross ethical limits: the right to perform dissection on the recently deceased (1799) and use of embryos in stem-cell research (1999). Both years are symbolic‚Äîthey stand at the turns of new centuries and have to face the challenges the new times are about to bring. There will be a great development in medicine in the 19th and of genetics in the 21st centuries. The play also implicitly deals with gender roles and questions the stereotypes of women scientists. While in 1799, it is the father (Fenwick) who is the enlightened soul and his male friends are also scientists (Armstrong, the physician, and Roget, the to-be-author of the thesaurus), his wife (Susannah) is a stereotypical wife of the time and their two daughters (Maria and Harriet) are expected to be such, too. The decision of one of them to become a scientist leads to disapproval. In 1999, the roles somehow change: Ellen, the wife, is the geneticist, and her husband, Tom, is a historian. Ellen's friend, Kate, is also a young genetic researcher. There are also two \\"uneducated\\" characters: Isobel, the 1799 maid, and Phil, the 1999 handyman. An additional theme of this play involves the ethics of using human life, in any form, for the advancement of science. Though the topic is not specifically discussed in 1799, the characters in 1999 do talk about the issue, though no concrete conclusions are drawn. Besides the general questions about a scientist's responsibilities and limits, the play is in part a detective story. In the modern times, a skeleton is found in the basement. The skipping between the two time periods highlights, then resolves, questions about the identity of the corpse and the means of their death. After Armstrong seduces Isobel, he confesses to Roget that he feigned love for Isobel because then she would agree to have intercourse with him. If she is naked, then he can examine her twisted spine more thoroughly. Isobel overhears and is moved to kill herself by hanging. Armstrong finds her hanging and speeds up the process. The characters in 1799 ring in the new year with the death of Isobel, whereas, the characters in 1999 begin the new millennium leaving their old home, and the certainties it possessed for them, behind. Characters=Dr. Joseph Fenwick (1799) Dr. Fenwick is a radical physician who believes that republicanism is the way forward. He has a fairly cynical view of the world and is a scientist because he \\"want[s] to change the world\\". Susannah Fenwick (1799) Susannah is the wife of Joseph Fenwick. She is, in some respects, the 1799 equivalent of Tom, with a passion for reading, poetry and art. Susannah overcomes issues with her husband about love and respect throughout the play, though it is clear she drinks heavily and relies upon childish behaviour to gain the attention she so desperately requires. Harriet Fenwick (1799) Harriet is the daughter of Joseph and Susannah Fenwick and the sister of Maria. She admires her Father but loses her temper easily. Maria Fenwick (1799) Maria is also the daughter of Joseph and Susannah Fenwick and is the sister of Harriet. She always wants to be the centre of attention and is in constant competition with Harriet to see who can be the better daughter. She is engaged to a character who is never seen on stage called Edward. Peter Mark Roget (1799) Roget is the only character in the play based on a real person- the creator of Roget's Thesaurus. In the play, he is a character in whom an inward moral battle rages about the ethics of science, though he maintains that he is a scientist because he wants to \\"understand the world\\". Thomas Armstrong (1799) Armstrong is a cold, ruthless physician who is particularly interested with the structure of the human body. He is staying with the Fenwicks after Dr. Farleigh (a character never seen on stage) persuades Dr. Fenwick to \\"take him on for three months\\". Isobel Bridie (1799) Isobel is the maid of the Fenwick household. She is originally from lowland Scotland and has a hunchback. Although timid, Isobel has a passion for words and it is evident that she is an intelligent, though self-conscious person. Ellen (1999) Ellen is a geneticist who is being persuaded to take a job that is being offered to her from Kate's company. Tom (1999) Tom is Ellen's husband and is an English lecturer but he has been made redundant. Therefore, he is depressed and has concerns about Ellen's job. Phil (1999) Phil is a geordie building surveyor who is surveying Ellen and Tom's house which they are planning to sell. He offers human compassion and comic relief in the play. Kate (1999) Kate is Ellen's friend/fellow geneticist who offers her a job at her company. She is in direct conflict with Tom for most of the play as they both have opposing views on the conduct and morality of scientific exploration.

As of February 2010, the station is broadcasting in Spanish, Portuguese, and Greek. Although during the day, the station has a 50,000 watt signal that covers the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex adequately, at night KMNY's signal is significantly weaker. Nighttime reception can be problematic outside the immediate Dallas-Fort Worth area due to more powerful stations broadcasting on identical or nearby frequencies from elsewhere in the U.S. and Mexico. History=The early years KMNY was established in 1947 as KXOL and featured a variety of entertainment programs and country music during its early years. From 1956 to 1976, KXOL played Top 40 music, competing with 1270 KFJZ. Station personalities during the late 1950s included comedians George Carlin and Jack Burns. With the rise of FM radio and a decrease in ratings and revenue after the combination of Dallas and Fort Worth into one radio market, KXOL switched back to country music in 1976. In the early-1980s, KXOL also carried the weekend editions of the Texas Night Train and Wonderful Radio London programs, which were carried full-time on Mexican border blaster station XERF-AM. Other than the special weekend programming, KXOL continued as a country station until it was sold in 1985 and became KWJS, featuring Christian oriented programming. KWJS became KNRB in 1988, featuring country and then religious formats, and then became KAHZ in 1993, airing children's programming from the Radio AAHS network. After Radio AAHS discontinued operations in January 1998, Children's Broadcasting Corporation, KAHZ's owner, needed programming for the network of stations until they could find buyers. The station, along with the other nine CBC-owned and operated Radio AAHS affiliates, flipped to \\"Beat Radio\\", which broadcast electronic dance music 12 hours a day until late October 1998. KAHZ switched to Catholic religious programming in 1998 and later to Spanish-language talk programming. Biz Radio Network thumb The KMNY calls were established in March 2005, and the business talk format the following month as KMNY Biz Radio 1360. Nighttime slots were filled with brokered programming in Spanish, Chinese and other languages, or automated Adult Standards music during non-sponsored times. Beginning in 2006, KMNY airs \\"The Hi-Fi Club,\\" a live, weekly oldies/talk show that resurrected its name from KXOL's \\"Coca Cola Hi-Fi Club\\" (1959‚Äì62; originally hosted by comedian George Carlin.) Hosts Mike Shannon, John Lewis Puff, and Ray Whitworth cover historic local and national events, along with local radio and television history, regularly breaking an unwritten rule by discussing competing area stations by name. Offbeat and candid in nature, it also features live and recorded interviews with historical local radio notables such as Norman Alden, Bob Schieffer, Bud Buschardt, George Gimarc, Jack Burns, Russ Bloxom and Bob Allen. In November 2006, \\"The Hi-Fi Club\\" presented the radio special, \\"As it Happened: The Lost JFK Assassination Tapes of KXOL-1360\\" over KMNY. This was a two-hour compilation of audio recordings from KXOL, mostly in the post-assassination hours and continuing into the early morning of 11/23/1963. The recordings were edited from reels provided by KXOL newsman Russ Bloxom, who was on duty at the station's newsdesk when President John F. Kennedy was killed, and had never been replayed. \\"The Hi-Fi Club\\" reunited the recordings with their original frequency, and Russ Bloxom provided a new five-minute interview as part of the presentation. An edited version of the presentation aired over KMNY on November 23, 2008. In January 2007, the station aired a sports talk show titled \\"Sports Kings.\\" In January 2008, the station began airing progressive talk programming sponsored by Rational Radio (via Nova M Radio) from 7PM-midnight, featuring Mike Malloy. The BizRadio Network left KMNY (1360) for KJSA (1110 AM) on May 23, 2008. Testing of the new 1110 frequency's signal began in April 2008. (In 2007, KJSA received a construction permit to move from 1120, to 1110 AM‚Äîwith a considerable power increase to 20,000 watts.) From May 24 to June 30, 2008, KMNY aired \\"Retro Radio,\\" a block format put together by \\"The Hi-Fi Club\\"'s Mike Shannon. Weekdays, oldies shows were hosted by Jim Thomas, Bud Buschardt, Randy Carlisle, Josh Holstead, John Lewis and Jay Weaver; \\"The Larry Stanley Show,\\" an irreverent 'guy talk' show, aired Saturdays; and \\"The Hi-Fi Club\\" expanded to Sunday afternoons. Music during non-show times consisted of automated Modern Classic Rock. Retro Radio aired a tribute to George Carlin upon his death in June 2008. KXOL-1360 veterans Bob Bruton and Jack Burns participated. Rational Radio Rational Radio logo Rational Radio group leased the entire 24-hour-a-day KMNY schedule from MRBI as of July 1, 2008, through December 31, 2009. In addition to Mike Malloy, the new schedule featured Dial Global's Ed Schultz (delayed), Bill Press, and Thom Hartmann, and Air America's Lionel (delayed). KMNY's \\"The Hi-Fi Club\\" was on the station prior to the switch of the station from Biz Radio to Rational Radio and was carried over into the Rational Radio Format. On April 1, 2009, Rational Radio added local hosts The Pugs and Kelly Show on weekday afternoons with Richard Hunter following. Weekend hosts included Cindy Sheehan of \\"Cindy Sheehan's Soapbox\\" and Jack E. Jett. The rest of the lineup was filled syndicated programming including Thom Hartmann and Air America Radio. In December 2009, station president Dave Clifton announced that the station had been outbid for its lease renewal and, in the face of the economic climate and declining advertising revenue, would move much its locally originated programming to internet radio. While Rational Radio seeks a new broadcast home, they ended their run on KMNY on December 31, 2009. KMNY today On January 1, 2010, KMNY returned to a business talk radio format, airing the Biz Radio Network once again with a 24-hour lineup. As of February 2010, the programming on KMNY (1360) is Spanish, Portuguese, and Greek. And the Biz Radio Network is not on the air in the Dallas area at this time. KMNY's \\"Hi-Fi\\" Club has since moved to other stations in the Area and is no longer heard on 1360. On April 28, 2014, owner Multicultural announced the station is for sale.

The El Rey del Mundo logo  History  Believed to have been created, along with Sancho Panza, by German businessman Emilio Ohmstedt in 1848, El Rey del Mundo (King of the World in Spanish) was at one time the most expensive and prestigious cigar brand in the world. Spanish businessman Antonio Allones took over the brand sometime around 1882 (a rival version of the brand's history claims the brand became defunct after Ohmstedt's death and Allones re-registered it, but cigar connoisseur Min Ron Nee maintains the brand was passed to Allones from Ohmstedt's company, based on records stating Allones as the owner of El Rey del Mundo from as early as 1873). Under Allones, the brand reached the height of its worldwide prestige. In 1905, Allones' company was bought by the D√≠az Hermanos y C√≠a venture, owned by C√°ndido Vega D√≠az (supposedly the namesake of Don C√°ndido cigars), which was later renamed the Rey del Mundo Cigar Co. to reflect its most famous asset. Production moved to a factory at 852 Calle Belascoain in Havana. The company also produced such famous brands as Sancho Panza, Rafael Gonz√°lez, and Don C√°ndido. Production continued after the Revolution and the brand maintained its popularity through the 1960s and 1970s, but as the world taste started to run towards stronger cigars, the milder El Rey del Mundo brand began to lose its status as a foremost brand of Cuban cigars. Despite its loss of popularity, El Rey del Mundos cigars are still prized for their mild, complex flavors, with the Choix Supreme, Grandes de Espa√±a, and Demi Tasse sizes being particularly popular among connoisseurs. box of El Rey del Mundo Choix Supreme Vitolas in the El Rey del Mundo Line The following list of vitolas de salida (commercial vitolas) within the El Rey del Mundo marque lists their size and ring gauge in Imperial (and Metric), their vitolas de galera (factory vitolas), and their common name in American cigar slang.

KXYZ features brokered programming, in which station management sells airtime by the hour to interested third parties wishing to broadcast over the air. The transmitter is in Pasadena, Texas. History KTUE went on the air in 1926 under the auspices of Uhalt Electric. It broadcast with just 5 watts on 1140, 1410 and 1420 kHz. In 1930, Uhalt sold the station to the Harris County Broadcasting Company, which changed the call letters to KXYZ and built a new 100-watt facility. In 1932, KXYZ absorbed another station, KTLC, and moved to 1440 kHz at 250 watts. Further increases to 500 watts, then 1,000, soon followed. NARBA relocated the station to 1470 kHz in 1941. When KTRH moved to 710 kHz, KXYZ took over the former KTRH antenna and began broadcasting with 5,000 watts on 1320. On June 17, 1948, the Federal Communications Commission approved the purchase of Harris County Broadcasting Company by Shamrock Broadcasting Company, owned by Glenn H. McCarthy. The Houston Broadcasting Corporation bought KXYZ in 1957. During the 1960s, KXYZ was owned by ABC and played beautiful music. The station was well known in the 1960s for its vividly descriptive station identification promos, such as: :\\"In Houston's downtown area, lifeless mannequins draped in the latest attire stand stiff and silent in the shops, which a few hours ago buzzed with the excitement of bargain- hunting shoppers... now relaxing at home to Beautiful KXYZ Music.\\" :\\"The almost-deserted parking garage is lonely and unfamiliar to a late-staying office worker, whose footsteps echo as he walks to his car and turns on the radio. And the lonely feeling is dispelled by Beautiful KXYZ Music.\\" In the mid-1970s, the format changed to pop music. Around 1980, it changed over to a Christian station after KXYZ was acquired by Slater Broadcasting the year prior. In 1983, Infinity Broadcasting absorbed KXYZ. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, it was a Spanish language contemporary music station known as \\"Radio 13\\"; During this period, KXYZ carried Houston Astros and Houston Rockets games in Spanish. KXYZ then carried the Spanish talk format of satellite network Radio Unica. In July 1998, Multicultural Broadcasting bought KXYZ from Infinity/CBS, and Biz Radio made its debut in the early years of the 2000s. Biz Radio left KXYZ for KTEK in Alvin, Texas. It purchased KTEK and began signal testing in November 2007 simulcasting with KXYZ until December 11, 2007. The only drawback of the move to KTEK is that its signal is only licensed to broadcast during the daytime, while KXYZ has nighttime authorization. As of November 4, 2019, KXYZ is broadcasting in four different language Texas Chinese Radio (Mandarin Chinese); DTHT Radio (Vietnamese); Radio Gracia (Spanish); DATT Performing Arts (Hindi); Geetanjali Radio (Hindi); and Radio Me Hang Cuu Giup (Vietnamese).

The eleventh tropical depression and the seventh tropical storm of the season, Grace was also the weakest storm of the season. On August 30 the storm developed from a long-track tropical wave in the western Gulf of Mexico. Grace remained disorganized throughout its lifetime due to an upper level low to its west. The weak storm moved northwestward and made landfall on southeastern Texas. Grace quickly weakened over land, and dissipated on September 2 as it merged into a cold front. In Texas, the storm dropped heavy rainfall, causing minor flash flooding damage. The cold front, combined with the remnants of the storm, dropped moderate to heavy rainfall from Texas through the Mid-Atlantic. The worst of the flooding occurred in Indianapolis, where record rainfall affected over 700 homes. Despite the rainfall, damage was minimal along its path. Meteorological history A strong tropical wave accompanied with a low pressure system moved off the coast of Africa on August 19. It moved quickly westward and organized, developing banding features and cirrus outflow near the blossoming convection. The wave nearly developed into a tropical cyclone on August 21, though its fast forward motion dislocated the low level circulation from the deep convection. The wave entered an area of dry air in the central Atlantic Ocean, and by late on August 22 most of the convection dissipated from the system. On August 24, convection increased as the wave passed through the Lesser Antilles, though strong southwesterly upper level wind shear prevented further development. The tropical wave moved through the Caribbean Sea, and developed deep convection due to more favorable conditions over the Gulf of Honduras on August 28. The wave crossed the Yucat√°n Peninsula, and developed a surface low pressure area on the 29th in the Gulf of Mexico. Convection continued to organize, and the tropical wave developed into Tropical Depression Eleven on August 30 while located 335 miles (540 km) east-southeast of Corpus Christi, Texas. The depression moved to the northwest, and intensified into Tropical Storm Grace six hours after forming. Despite the increase in winds the center of circulation remained very broad, with Reconnaissance Aircraft having difficulty pinpointing the center. In addition, an upper level low located over Brownsville, Texas produced shear over the western portion of the system, which limited outflow to the east side. Forecasters predicted the upper level low to weaken, allowing for the possibility of Grace to intensify to a 65 mph (100 km/h) tropical storm over warm waters. However, the upper level low remained in place and continued to produce shear across the system. A new center of circulation reformed 115 miles (185 km) north of the original center, and made landfall near San Luis Pass on the southwestern portion of Galveston Island on August 31 as a minimal tropical storm. Grace quickly weakened to a tropical depression over land, and after turning northeastward into Oklahoma the depression was absorbed by a cold front. Preparations Three hours after forming, officials issued Tropical Storm Warnings from High Island to Corpus Christi, Texas. Local National Weather Service offices requested a voluntary evacuation for western Galveston Island including Jamaica Beach, the Bolivar Peninsula, and coastal areas of Brazoria and Matagorda counties, though few residents heeded the warnings. Local emergency management officials predicted tides of up to 5 feet (1.5 m) above normal with coastal flooding. Impact Rainfall totals for Grace Grace produced moderate amounts of rainfall along its path, peaking in southern Texas. The storm later merged with a cold front, which later dropped heavy rainfall in the Mid-West United States. In addition to its impact on the United States, the outer rainbands of Grace caused light rainfall in Yucat√°n and northern Tamaulipas. South-Central United States Upon making landfall, Tropical Storm Grace produced a light storm surge of 3.5 feet (1 m) in Matagorda and North Jetty, Texas. Wind gusts peaked at 53 mph (85 km/h) with sustained winds of 40 mph (64 km/h) at Sea Rim State Park. Locations closer to where the storm made landfall reported below tropical storm force winds, with the exception of Galveston which recorded a 40 mph (64 km/h) wind gust. Rainfall was moderate to heavy across eastern Texas, peaking at 10.36 inches (263 mm) in Spindletop Bayou. The outer bands of Grace spawned a waterspout just south of the western tip of Galveston Island, prompting the issuance of a tornado warning. The waterspout dissipated before moving onshore. The storm also caused light beach erosion, though little occurred beyond the erosion caused by Hurricane Claudette one month prior. Near the coast, high tides from the storm flooded piers, bulkheads, and low-lying areas. Further inland, heavy rainfall lead to flash flooding, covering roads and entering a few houses. Overall, damage was minor, and totaled to $113,000 (2003 USD, $147,100 2016 USD). In Oklahoma, moisture from the storm, combined with a slow-moving cold front, produced heavy rainfall across the state, peaking at 8.98 inches (228 mm) in Courtney. Due to below normal precipitation by as much as 5 to 10 inches (127 to 255 mm), flooding was localized and overall minimal. Near Medford, the rainfall led to 2 feet (0.6 m) deep flooding on U.S. Highway 81, forcing its closure. The rainfall was welcome in the state, and lessened the rainfall deficit. Tropical Storm Grace, combined with the slow-moving cold front, produced light to moderate rainfall totals across the southern United States, including isolated locations in Louisiana and Mississippi reporting over 3 inches (76 mm) and over 5 inches (127 mm) in northeastern Arkansas. Ohio Valley and Eastern United States In Missouri, the cold front combined with moisture from the remnants of Grace brought temporary relief to a severe drought by producing light to moderate rainfall of up to 5 inches (127 mm) in the southeastern portion of the state. In Poplar Bluff, the rainfall caused severe flooding, resulting in rescues for people in trapped vehicles. The moisture produced over 5 inches (127 mm) in northern Kentucky, as well. Moisture from the remnants of Grace dropped heavy rainfall across central Indiana, including a record one-day total of 7 inches (178 mm) in Indianapolis, while other locations received over 9 inches (228 mm). Residents prepared sand bags to prevent overflowing rivers and creeks, though rising waters entered streets and over 700 homes. The rapid rainfall in Indianapolis backed up the sewage system, sending hundreds of millions of gallons of sewage into the streets. Following the deluge in the state, the governor declared a state of emergency for the state. Eight local American Red Cross chapters arrived to provide meals and aid to the affected people. The remnants of Grace dropped moderate to heavy rainfall eastward through the Mid-Atlantic States and New England. Locations in extreme western Maryland and southeastern Virginia received over 5 inches (127 mm) of rain. In Maryland, Hagerstown recorded 3.94 inches (100 mm), resulting in flash flooding. In Washington County, the system produced 1.09 inches (27.8 mm) of rain, a new daily record. Damage in Maryland, if any, was unknown.

Hallington is actually two small reservoirs: Hallington Reservoir West and Hallington Reservoir East, which are separated by a dam. Water was first collected from the area by an aqueduct intercepting streams, which was built between 1857 and 1859 by the Whittle Dean Water Company. The work included a tunnel to allow the water to flow by gravity from the collecting area through a ridge of higher ground to the company's main reservoirs at Whittle Dene. An Act of Parliament was obtained in 1863 to build Hallington Reservoir, which also changed the company name to the Newcastle and Gaateshead Water Company. After some delays work started on construction in 1869, and the reservoir was completed in 1872. Water was fed from it to Whittle Dene through the existing aqueduct and tunnel. As the populations of Newcastle and Gateshead continued to grow, more water was needed, and a second reservoir was constructed at Hallington, known as the West Reservoir. Land was purchased in 1880, and work started in 1884, using direct labour under the supervision of John Forster, the resident engineer. Despite appalling weather in the winters of 1886 and 1887, and a poor understanding of soil mechanics which affected the construction of the dams, the reservoir was completed in 1889, with filling beginning in May 1889. Hallington received water from other reservoirs constructed further to the north-west, notably at Swinburn, Colt Crag and Catcleugh. The existing aqueduct and tunnel to Whittle Dene was found to be inadequate for the volume of water needed, and a second tunnel, parallel to the first, was constructed between 1898 and 1905. Narrow gauge railways were built to aid the construction of the first reservoir and the second tunnel. The reservoirs are a designated Local Wildlife Site. The east reservoir is partially surrounded by mixed woodland, and small-fruited yellow sedge, a very rare marginal plant, grows near the dam between the two reservoirs. Several species of waders populated the reservoirs in the autumn, and it provides over-wintering habitat for numerous wildfowl. History The reservoir was built at the end of the 19th century for the Newcastle and Gateshead Water Company. The reservoir forms part of a series of reservoirs along the A68 which are connected by tunnels and aqueducts from Catcleugh Reservoir to Whittle Dene; from where drinking water is supplied to Newcastle upon Tyne, Gateshead, and some surrounding areas. The reservoirs that form the chain are, from northwest to southeast: Catcleugh Reservoir ‚Üí Colt Crag Reservoir ‚Üí Little Swinburne Reservoir ‚Üí Hallington Reservoirs ‚Üí Whittle Dene. Newcastle and Gateshead had been provided with water from reservoirs at Whittle Dene, but the rapid growth of the towns in the mid-nineteenth century, coupled with several years of drought, meant that these were inadequate. The Whittle Dean Water Company, as it was then known, had attempted to get powers to build a reservoir on the Swin Burn, but their Act of Parliament obtained in 1854 had been amended after Thomas Riddell objected to the reservoir. Although the reservoir had been removed from the Act, they were empowered to build an aqueduct, which would intercept a number of streams between Hallington and Ryal, to the north west of Matfen. In order to convey the water to the main reservoirs at Whittle Dean, a tunnel was required through a ridge of higher land. Tenders for the construction of the tunnel were sought in 1856, and from the 25 received, the contract was awarded to R Mains & Co, who had quoted ¬£7,101 for the work. An arrangement with the Duke of Northumberland was negotiated, to allow a brickworks to be built on his land, as a way of reducing transport costs for materials. Work on the construction began in 1857, but by February 1858 Mains had failed to get very far. He was paid ¬£500 for the work he had done, and a second contract was awarded to Roper & Smith. By March, the new contractor was working on seven of the twelve shafts and some tunnelling had been started, although the works were hampered by the ingress of water. The directors were hoping for quick completion of the tunnel, to prevent difficulties with supplying water to the towns. They offered Roper & Smith an additional ¬£300, if they would set men on to tunnelling from all of the available shafts. Roper & Smith were facing financial difficulties by November 1858, and the tunnel was not expected to be completed for another two years. The directors offered another ¬£1,000 if the work could be completed in a year, but the contractor did not feel able to commit to such a deadline. As a consequence, Richard Cail took over the works on 1 December 1858. At that time, of the tunnel had been excavated, out of a total of . From sums of money paid to Cail, it would appear that he was employing 200 to 300 men on the contract, and the tunnelling progressed well, although there were difficulties at both ends, where the limestone was particularly hard. The tunnel was completed by 31 December 1859, thirteen months after Cail took over the contract. Shortly afterwards, much of the plant used on the project was put up for sale, including nine steam engines, 60 tons of bridge rails, 14 sets of pumps and two brick and tile making machines. The land at Tongues Farm, where the brickworks had been operating, was returned to agricultural use. Many of the workmen had lived in huts in this remote area, and those were demolished. Most of the shafts were arched over and filled in. The main fault identified was a step at the western end, resulting in water standing to a depth of , which Cail claimed was due to inaccurate drawings. In 1862 the company found out that Riddell would not object to a reservoir at Hallington, and so this was included in an Act of Parliament obtained in 1863. The engineer for the company was John Frederick Bateman, but it was Thomas Hawksley who steered the bill through Parliament, so he may have been acting to protect the interests of Newcastle Corporation. The landowners were Henry H Riddell and Catharine Ann Tevelyan, and following negotiations with both parties, the company paid ¬£9,500 for the land on which to construct the reservoir. The contract ensured that the fishing and shooting rights were retained by the landowners, but were also available to the directors and their friends. Measurement of the flow in various streams in the vicinity had shown that the yield might not be as high as Bateman had estimated. The Act authorising the reservoir received Royal Assent on 11 May 1863, and also changed the name of the company to the Newcastle and Gateshead Water Company, reflecting the area they supplied rather than where the water came from. In addition to the reservoir, two aqueducts were authorised, one to the east and another to the west, which fed water into the reservoir. The enabling Act had imposed time restrictions on completing the reservoir, and in 1866 the company went back to Parliament for a second Act, which extended the time limits. The contract for construction was given to McGuire, at a cost of ¬£19,900 and work began on the project on 11 September 1869. The directors decided that no payment would be made until the contractor had spent ¬£2,000. Three months later, McGuire was in financial trouble, and the company decided to complete the work themselves. McGuire was hired to oversee the work, and paid a salary of ¬£200 per year. Construction of the reservoir was aided by a narrow gauge railway, some in length, built to bring stone from Moot Law Quarry. A locomotive to work the line was obtained from Black, Hawthorn & Co. of Gateshead. The workers were affected by an outbreak of smallpox, and there were some problems with settlement of the western embankment. Because the company were desperately short of water, they started impounding water in the reservoir in December 1870, when the work done thus far meant that it could safely hold , nearly half of its capacity when it was completed in 1872. Surplus plant was sold off in October 1871, the locomotive was sold in spring 1872, and another sale took place in November 1972. When the work was finished, McGuire was paid his ¬£2,000,. Water from the reservoir was conveyed to Whittle Dean using the aqueduct and tunnel which had been completed in 1859. It is unclear how well the new reservoir performed. It had a capacity of , effectively doubling the amount of water the company could store. Bateman had estimated that the rainfall in the area would be per year, whereas records for a ten-year period showed that it was actually . Despite these facts, the company expressed disappointment at the yield it gave, and the Newcastle Daily Journal, in an article sympathetic to the plight of the company published in September 1874, stated that there had been a miscalculation in the yield available. John Furness Tone wrote a letter to Newcastle Council stating that the capacity of the reservoir was reduced due to the fissured nature of the underlying rock in the area. He stated that Bateman had built the reservoir against his advice, which surprised the company's engineer, as Tone and Robert Nicholson had recommended the Hallington reservoir while working for the Whittle Dean Water Company. West reservoir With the company struggling to meet the volume of water needed by the rapidly expanding towns of Newcastle and Gateshead, it decided to build a second reservoir at Hallington and two at Swinburn. By the time a bill was placed before Parliament in February 1876, there were three reservoirs at Swinburn. The bill was opposed by both Newcastle and Gateshead Corporations, although their objections were eventually withdrawn, and by John Gifford Riddell, on whose land the Swinburn reservoirs would be built. Lower Swinburn reservoir was deleted in the committee stage of the bill, which became an Act of Parliament in July 1976. The company obtained a second Act in 1877, to authorise alterations to the Swinburn scheme, and at the same time extended the time allowed to build West Hallington reservoir. Land was bought in 1880, but construction did not start until Colt Crag reservoir, the revised Upper Swinburn reservoir, was completed. John Forster, the resident engineer, was paid an additional ¬£100 per year to supervise and direct the works, which began in 1884. A source of stone was located near to Colt Crag reservoir, and a narrow gauge railway was built to transport it to the site. Clay was obtained from the site for the embankments, and bricks were made from book-leaf marl. This covered the area, and would subsequently be the cause of problems with the embankments. The company employed direct labour to build the reservoir, and some 60 navvies were engaged in this task. They used waggons and a hauling engine to move the material. Forster found that using manual labour was more cost-effective than using steam navvies. Work on the reservoir was suspended in early 1886 and early 1887, due to appalling weather conditions, and there were regular slippages in the embankments. The slope of the embankments was reduced, from 1 in 2 to 1 in 2.5, but a knowledge of soil mechanics was clearly lacking. Water was also a problem, and a spring which produced per day was discovered under one of the embankments in 1877. The reservoir started to fill in May 1889, although various tasks were still to be completed. In six years, some of earth had been moved, 33,000 waggons of stone had been transported along the railway, and 670,000 bricks had been manufactured and laid. The work had cost considerably more than the ¬£40,000 that Forster had estimated. Labour along had cost ¬£51,631, of which ¬£23,557 was for extras, but Forster was not alone in miscalculating costs, as the company had experienced similar problems with projects supervised by an engineer as eminent at Bateman. By 1898, reservoirs at Swinburn and Colt Crag had been completed, and a new reservoir at Catcleugh was in progress. The water was conveyed to Hallington by pipelines and aqueducts, and when flows from there to Whittle Dean exceeded per day, the aqueducts overflowed with a corresponding loss of water. The company looked at building a new pipeline with a capacity of per day, but when they presented a bill to Parliament they had decided on a new tunnel, running parallel to the existing tunnel near Ryal, into which water would be fed by a pipeline from the Hallington reservoir. The Act also allowed them to build a narrow gauge railway from Matfen, at the eastern end of the tunnel, to Wylam, on the River Tyne, via Whittle Dene. An extension from there, across the river to connect to the North Eastern Railway was also authorised, and the bill passed through Parliament unopposed, becoming an Act of Parliament in August 1898. A working site was established at the eastern end of the tunnel, with huts, offices, a canteen, spoil heaps and sidings for the railway. The work was managed by a Resident Engineer called Chamberlain, who presented reports to meetings of the directors. Two shafts were built, allowing work to continue on six faces, but the works were lit by electricity, and the company spent ¬£1,000 on drilling equipment from Schram & Co, which was powered by compressed air. A third shaft was later opened near the eastern end, providing eight faces for tunnelling. The tunnel was some long, and with so few shafts, boreholes were drilled down from the surface into the headings to check on its alignment. By 1903, one- third of the tunnel had been completed, and it was finished in 1905. One unfortunate consequence of the work was that the tunnel cut through the source of the spring that supplied Matfen village with water, and the company had to provide a new source. Once the works were completed, the railway between Matfen and Whittle Dene was lifted. The church at Ryal contains a memorial to those who died during the construction of the tunnel. The aqueduct from West Hallington reservoir consistently suffered from leakage, and this was eventually solved by lining it with concrete, some time prior to 1911. In that year there was another problem when a water main burst at the reservoir. Soon afterwards, there was a partial collapse of the upstream end of the old tunnel, which conveyed water to Whittle Dean. A new shaft was constructed to gain access to the fault. Timber was then used to shore up the affected section, after which it was relined. In 1942 the company board looked at the possibility of constructing a third reservoir at Hallington, and some trial borings were made, but a report in June 1943 suggested that such a reservoir would only yield per day, and that a new reservoir at Kielder would be a better proposition. The company had obtained an Act of Parliament in 1938 for various works, including a pipeline from Barrasford to West Hallington, to enable water to be pumped from the North Tyne, and repairs to the Ryal tunnel and aqueduct. The Barrasford pipeline and pumping station were completed by autumn 1940. The Act had stipulated that all works should be completed by 1945, and with the end of the Second World War in sight, repairs to the tunnel and aqueduct were completed before the deadline passed. Responsibility for the reservoirs passed to the Northumbrian Water Authority in April 1974, as a result of the passing of the Water Act 1973. It then passed to Northumbrian Water when the water industry was privatised in 1989. Flora and fauna The north-western part of Hallington Reservoir East is surrounded by mixed woodland, including evergreen varieties such as Scots pine and larch, with some native deciduous species, such as beech, willow, and sycamore. The dam between the two reservoirs provides habitat for marginal plants, particularly the very rare small-fruited yellow sedge. The reservoirs are used for overwintering by several varieties of wildfowl, including wigeon, teal, and mallard, while during the autumn waders including dunlin, black-headed, and common gulls can be seen in large numbers. The surrounding area still had a population of red squirrels which are seen from time to time, as are otters, badgers, and bats. The aqueduct that feeds into the reservoirs had been colonised by a healthy population of white-clawed crayfish Austropotamobius pallipes, when a survey was carried out in 2009. Fishing Hallington is fished by many anglers.

That's why Washington loves him\\", The Washington Post, January 29, 1989. History The firm traces its history to 1840 in the Republic of Texas, with the beginning of legal practice by founding partner Peter W. Gray. Gray represented the Allen Brothers, founders of the city of Houston. Confederate Colonel Walter Browne Botts (from Fredericksburg, Virginia) joined the firm in 1865, and it became Gray and Botts. In 1872, James Addison Baker (a.k.a. Judge Baker; 1821‚Äì1897; from Huntsville, Texas) joined the firm and the name was changed to Gray, Botts & Baker. Gray left the partnership in 1874, to join the Supreme Court of Texas, and the two remaining partners, Walter Browne Botts and Judge Baker, renamed the firm Baker & Botts. Peter Gray also died in 1874. Judge Baker's son, also James Addison Baker (a.k.a. Captain Baker, 1857‚Äì1941) joined the firm as a clerk in 1877, a lawyer in 1881, and became partner in 1887, at which time the name became Baker, Botts and Baker. In 1896, Captain Baker, personal attorney for Texas millionaire William Marsh Rice (Rice had become a client of Peter Gray in the 1850s), drew up a new will for Rice and was the will's executor. In 1900, Rice was poisoned in his bed by his valet, Charles F. Jones, and his New York City lawyer, Albert T. Patrick‚Äîa sensational crime that made national headlines. Captain Baker was a key witness and helped investigate the murder after Patrick produced a will that gave him control of five million dollars in 1904. Baker got the will he drew up entered as evidence in the case, and it was subsequently proved that Patrick had forged Rice's signature on the will he submitted. The case was not settled until 1910, and by that time the estate had grown to almost 10 million dollars. When the intent of Rice's will was finally executed, it led to the establishment of the William Marsh Rice Institute for the Advancement of Literature, Art, and Science, which is now called Rice University.The Life of William Marsh Rice Captain Baker was the first chairman of the Rice Board of Trustees. Rice University has maintained ties to Baker Botts since that time. Jules Henri Tallichet joined the firm in 1909, bringing with him Southern Pacific Railroad, his major client at Sam R. Fisher in Austin, Texas. Captain Baker's son, James Addison Baker, Jr. (1892‚Äì1973), also joined the firm in 1919 and his classmate and friend Henry Malcolm Lovett (son of the first president of Rice University, Edgar Odell Lovett) joined in 1924. Walter H. Walne served as managing partner from 1926 to 1933. James Addison Baker, III, former Chief of Staff in President Ronald Reagan's first administration and United States Secretary of State (a.k.a. James Baker), joined the firm as a senior partner in 1993, after leaving public service. He maintained two offices in Washington, being also affiliated as a partner at the Carlyle Group (with the title of senior counsel).Vise, David A.. \\"Former Secretary of State Baker Joins Carlyle Group\\", The Washington Post, March 11, 1993.

The two oil giants were embroiled in a bitter feud between Putin and an opponent of his, Khodorkovsy, the controlling shareholder of Yukos. Khodorkovsky was subsequently jailed, and Rosneft picked up the pieces of Yukos' bankruptcy. Journalist Joep Dohmen of NRCRosneft manipuleerde de rechtsgang in Nederland, NRC, 24 November 2016 wrote that Baker Botts helped its client Rosneft forge Armenian court rulings, to shore up Rosneft's claims in Dutch courts. NRC, claiming possession of the actual court papers, found that Baker Botts partner Ryan Bull, and his Moscow associate Izabella Sarkisyan were co-authors of the verdict in Case 1494, which, according to NRC, was handed to Armenian judge Dremeyan on a USB drive. According to NRC, the text included the Armenian coat of arms.

This article provides a list of fictional stories in which assassination features as an important plot element. Passing mentions are omitted. Assassination can be regarded as the murder of a prominent person for a motive which is broadly public and political rather than merely personal or financial. Murders within families are often termed assassinations if the family members are very prominent. This would be true of Roman Empire poisonings, or the 2001 slaughter of the royal family in Nepal. The murder of the well-known actor Phil Hartman by his wife in 1998 does not qualify. Is the 1978 murder of actor Bob Crane assassination? No. Is the 1987 murder of singer Peter Tosh by robbers assassination? If the motive is extortion, no. If an author writes a novel proposing a broad conspiracy, then yes. Is the 1948 death of actor Solomon Mikhoels assassination? Yes. It was orchestrated by Stalin. King Charles I? No. Executed publicly, after a trial. Tsar Nicholas II? Yes. Executed secretly, with his children, without a trial. There will always be a problem with a precise definition and applying that definition to specific cases. Assassinations in fiction have attracted scholarly attention. In Assassinations and Murder in Modern Italy: Transformations in Society and Culture, as well as analyzing Italian assassinations in their historical and cultural contexts, Stephen Gundle and Lucia Rinaldi explore the films, plays, other works of fiction, and art that the act of assassination has inspired.Assassinations and Murder in Modern Italy: Transformations in Society and Culture, edited by Stephen Gundle and Lucia Rinaldi (Palgrave Macmillan, 2007) Nick Cullather has discussed \\"The Movie Version\\" of John F.

(Ink drawing from the collection of Hippolyte Destailleur) Caf√© chantant (French: lit. \\"singing caf√©\\"), caf√©-concert or caf‚Äôconc, is a type of musical establishment associated with the Belle √âpoque in France. The music was generally lighthearted, sometimes risqu√©, even bawdy but, as opposed to the cabaret tradition, not particularly political or confrontational. Although there is much overlap of definition with cabaret, music hall, vaudeville, etc. the caf√© chantant was originally an outdoor caf√© where small groups of performers performed popular music for the public. National variations Henri-Gabriel Ibels, Le Caf√© Concert, cover for a book illustrated by Ibels and Toulouse-Lautrec, 1893. The customer is Francisque Sarcey. The tradition of such premises as a venue for music has its origins in Paris and London of the 18th century, but gained its widest popularity in the late 19th and early 20th centuries with the growth of various other national \\"schools\\" of caf√® chantant (besides French). Thus, one spoke of an Italian, German, or Austrian caf√© chantant, for example. One of the most famous performers in this medium was violinist Georges Boulanger who performed in this style from 1910 till 1958. In Spain it was known as a caf√© cantante and became the centre for professional flamenco performances from the mid 19th century to the 1920s. Caf√©s chantants were known as kafe≈üantan in Turkish, and many were opened in the Beyoƒülu/P√©ra district of Istanbul in the early years of the twentieth century. They are described in great detail in the memoirs of such authors as Ahmed Rasim and Sermet Muhtar Alus. Earlier versions of the kafe≈üantan, known as kahvehane in Turkish, appeared in Istanbul during the Ottoman Era as early as 1554. Hundreds of them were opened continually, most of them with a social club status.seyhan.library.boun.edu.tr In the Russian Empire, the term was taken wholesale into the Russian language as \\"kafe-shantan\\" (–∫–∞—Ñ–µ-—à–∞–Ω—Ç–∞–Ω); Odessa was the city best known for its numerous kafe-shantany.

Sarre is located at the point where the old 'Island Road' from Margate to Canterbury crossed the Wantsum Channel initially by a ferry and from the late Middle Ages by a bridge. The route of this bridge is followed by a short section of the modern A28 and is still marked on some maps as Sarre Wall.  History =Mediaeval The important late Roman or early Anglo-Saxon Sarre Brooch was found near the village; it is now on display in the British Museum (near the Sutton Hoo finds),British Museum Collection along with many other important early mediaeval artefacts from the same cemetery.British Museum Collection The coastal confederation of Cinque Ports during its mediaeval period consisted of a confederation of 42 towns and villages in all. Sarre was included, under the 'limb' of Sandwich, Kent.http://www.villagenet.co.uk/history/1155-cinqueports.php  World War II  In July 1940 the village was turned into a model strong point by the 1st Canadian Pioneer Battalion. Within three weeks the village bristled with defences including fifteen casemates and a variety of flame traps, flame fougasses and other anti-tank devices. The Canadian commander Andrew McNaughton later recalled: \\"I turned a pioneer battalion loose to fortify Sarre in every possible way. They took ladies' boudoirs and turned them into machine-gun posts without showing anything from the outside; I'm sure they never got the concrete out. There was a big building inside the village that had a hoist for casks. The boys arranged a big barrel of petroleum, with phosphorus bombs inside, that was all poised ready to swing. When a tank came through the village and slowed to make the turn they would just pull a catch and the barrel would smack the tank fair and square and go off with a great gust of flame.\\" While McNaughton was inspecting the defences in August 1940, the village was attacked from the air and three bombs were dropped. A cottage was hit killing one adult and two or three children.  Today  The village has one public house, The Crown Inn ‚Äì this being known locally as the 'Cherry Brandy House'. A special recipe of Cherry Brandy can be purchased from behind the bar. A second public house, the King's Head, recently closed and was sold privately. The village mill (Sarre Windmill) was previously open to the public as a working windmill. Recently, the mill has closed and is not open to the public except for the ground floor which is a holiday cottage for two. The mill shop is now also a holiday cottage.Hoseasons Sarre Windmill Retrieved 2012-02-27 The surrounding buildings, including the Old Bakery and the Old Granary (which was originally thatched), have been sold privately and are now subdivided properties.

A monument in his honour was raised by public subscription in Higham, near Rochester. It still stands, although has been rebuilt twice.  The reforms  Larkin promoted the Parliamentary reforms in 1832 that gave the vote to every householder whose property rental value was more than ¬£10. The act introduced wide-ranging changes to electoral franchise legislation in the United Kingdom. Before the act, certain English boroughs were entitled to send MPs to parliament, while the remaining parts of each county voted as a whole. Although certain individual boroughs had been added or removed over the years, the reform act's most important consequence was the first wholesale review and revision of the list of enfranchised boroughs. Many new-grown towns gained the right to elect their own MPs and many rotten boroughs lost it.  Death and honour  Charles Larkin died, aged 58, at his home on Boley Hill, Rochester, on September 12, 1833. He had been a Liberal and contemporary reports describe him as ‚Äúone of the most prominent political characters in this country‚Äù. His coffin was interred in the family vault at nearby Gillingham on September 20. The hearse was drawn by six horses, after which came three mourning coaches, each drawn by four horses. These were followed by 160 gentlemen, two abreast and dressed in deep mourning; and then by several carriages. Most of the shops in the town were closed for the funeral. A subscription for a monument in his honour was opened in October, within a month had raised ¬£150 from 64 subscribers. Work on the monument began the next January and was completed by September, 1835. A contemporary newspaper report said: \\"It is a column nearly sixty feet in height, built of a composition called concrete, in imitation of stone, and the structure, by its correct and elegant proportions, reflects great credit upon the architect, Mr Ranger.\\" It contained the inscription: :The Friends of Freedom in Kent erected this Monument to the Memory of CHARLES LARKIN, :In grateful testimony to his fearless and long :Advocation of Civil and Religious Liberty :And his zealous exertions in promoting the :Ever Memorable Measure of :Parliamentary Reform :AD 1832 The monument, however, was not as sturdy as the man it commemorated. By August, 1860, it had fallen into such a state of disrepair that one newspaper reported: :The Larkin Monument, beyond Frindsbury, erected of concrete in a paltry manner, is found to be in peril of tumbling into a heap of rubbish. What a satire on a 'memorial'! It was repaired in 1869 by Benjamin Horne who added the inscription: :This monument was repaired and re-inscribed at the cost of Benjamin Worthy Horne, Esqre, of Mereworth, Kent, and of Russell Square, London. AD 1869 Concrete, however, was plainly a poor material for monuments, and the column was renovated again in 1974.

any other device in the network in an ad hoc manner. A definition of the wireless grid can be given as: \\"Ad hoc, distributed resource-sharing networks between heterogeneous wireless devices\\" The following key characteristics further clarify this concept: *No centralized control *Small, low powered devices *Heterogeneous applications and interfaces *New types of resources like cameras, GPS trackers and sensors *Dynamic and unstable users / resources The technologies that make up the wireless grid can be divided into two main categories; ad hoc networking and grid computing. (Wireless) Ad hoc networking In traditional networks, both wired and wireless, the connected devices, or nodes, depend on dedicated devices (edge devices) such as routers and/or servers for facilitating the throughput of information from one node to the other. These 'routing nodes' have the ability to determine where information is coming from and where it is supposed to go. They give out names and addresses (IP addresses) to each connected node and regulate the traffic between them. In wireless grids, such dedicated routing devices are not (always) available and the bandwidth that is permanently available to traditional networks has to be either 'borrowed' from an already existing network or publicly accessible bandwidth (open spectrum) has to be used. A group addressing this problem is MANET (Mobile Ad Hoc Network). Resource sharing One of the intended aspects of wireless grids is that it will facilitate the sharing of a wide variety of resources. These will include both technical as information resources. The former being bandwidth, QoS, and web services, but also computational power and data storage capacity. Information resources can include virtually any kind of data from databases and membership lists to pictures and directories. Ad hoc resource sharing between mobile devices in the wireless grid require for the devices to agree on sharing/communication protocols without the existence of dedicated servers. Coordination Systems Coordination Systems are the actual mechanisms that enable the sharing of resources between different devices. For different resources, devices use different coordination systems. Examples of such mechanisms are: SMB or NFS for sharing disk space and the distributed.net client for sharing processor cycles. Trust Establishment Before users are willing to share any resource, they demand a certain amount of trust between them and the users and/or systems they share resources with. The amount of trust required depends on the kind of information/resource that is to be shared. Sharing processor cycles requires less substantial trust then the sharing of personal information and commercial information can require another level of trust establishment altogether. There are systems currently in operation that can provide a certain amount of trust like the public key infrastructure that makes use of certificates; now often used in web based email systems, and Kerberos. Resource discovery Before any resource on a device in the grid can be utilized, those resources that are available must be discovered; all the devices that make up the grid and the resources they possess have to be identified. When a client enters the grid, such as a PDA, it has to be able to communicate to the other users that it is a PDA and it has a camera, GPS capabilities, a telephone function and various office applications such as a text editor. Protocols like UPnP and ZeroConf can detect a new node in the network when it enters. When detected, other users can send a query to the new device to find out what it has to offer. Commercial service providers can 'advertise' the resources they have to offer through IP multicasts. Within large grids containing thousands of nodes, a kind of 'friend of a friend' mechanism can be used. There is a myriad of standards that include resource description protocols. Standards as IETF's ZeroConf, Microsoft's UPnP, the Grid Resource Description Language (GRDL), the Web Services Description Language (WSDL) for describing various specific web services and parts of QoS that describe bandwidths all offer devices a way to describe and publish their specific resources and needs. There are also various systems currently available that can gather these resource descriptions and structure them for other devices to use. The OpenGrid Services Architecture (OGSA) uses a Web service-style IndexService. The Web services community has defined UDDI which can makes a database of services that are available on the network, and JXTA uses ZeroConf to identify resources in a network. However, the problem with using these in wireless grids is that no stable publisher of these descriptions may exist. Resource description For any device to be able to use any resource, a way to identify and describe the resource has to be agreed on by all available devices. If, for instance, storage capacity is to be shared, it first has to be clear what the capacity of each device is and what the storage need is. As said, there are many techniques to describe certain resources but there is not one technique that is able to provide this service for all resources. The available techniques combined, however, cover most of what is needed. Grid Computing Grid computing came into existence as a manner of sharing heavy computational loads among multiple computers to be able to compute highly complex mathematical problems (a good real-world example being the SETI@Home project). However, it developed rapidly into a way of sharing virtually any resource that is available on any machine on the grid. Wired grids are now used to share not only computing power, but also hard disk space, data, and applications. The grid topology is highly flexible and easily scalable, allowing users to join and leave the grid without the hassle of time and resource hungry identification procedures, having to adjust their devices or install additional software on them. The goal of grid computing is described as \\"to provide flexible, secure and coordinated resource sharing among dynamic collections of individuals, institutions and resources\\" (McKnight, Howison, 2004). It is intended to be a dynamic network without geographical, political, or cultural boundaries that offers real-time access to heterogeneous resources and still offer the same characteristics of the traditional distributed networks that are in use everywhere in our houses and offices. These characteristics being stability, scalability, and flexibility as the most important ones. Ian Foster offers a checklist for recognizing a grid. :A grid allows: *Coordination of resources that are not subject to centralized control *Use of standard, open, general-purpose protocols and interfaces *Delivery of nontrivial qualities of service The Wireless Grid One of the biggest limitations of the wired grid is that users are forced to be in a fixed location as the devices they use are to be hard wired to the grid at all times. This also has a negative influence on the flexibility and scalability of the grid; devices can only join the grid in locations where the possibility exists to physically connect the device to the grid (i.e. there is the need for a hub or a switch to plug into). One description of the wireless grid is \\"an augmentation of a wired grid that facilitates the exchange of information and the interaction between heterogeneous wireless devices\\" (Argawal, Norman & Gupta, 2004) Argawal, Norman & Gupta (2004) identify three forces that drive the development of the wireless grid: New user interaction modalities and form factors Applications that exist on current wired grids need to be adapted to fit the devices used in wireless grids. These devices are usually hand held and therefore the user interface devices (screens, keyboards (if any)) are significantly smaller and availability of additional input devices like a mouse are limited. This means the traditional graphical interfaces found on PCs are not suitable. Limited computing resources Wireless devices do not possess the computing power nor the storage capacity of full size devices like a PC or laptop. Therefore, wireless applications need to have access to additional computing resources to be able to offer the same functionality that wired networks do. Additional new supporting infrastructure elements In the case of an unforeseen event, there will be the need for major amounts of computational and communications bandwidths. An urban catastrophe, for example, would require a dynamic and adaptive wireless network to alert people within the population as well as those in the various coordination and aid services like the police, army, medical services, and government. Applications to provide for these bandwidths and 'instant' networks need to be addressed. Wireless Grids infrastructure The infrastructure of the wireless grid consists of three basic levels: *The physical layer technologies and policies. The physical layer contains the spectrum on which the wireless devices can operate and communicate. *Network infrastructure *Middleware to provide communications between heterogeneous devices See also *Bluetooth *IEEE 802.11 *Mesh network *Metcalfe's law *Overlay network *P2P *SOAP *Wi-Fi *Wireless local loop *X.509 External links *FCC *IETF Further reading *J√ºrgen Falkner, Fraunhofer Institute for Industrial Engineering; JNF/842, 2004), The Fraunhofer Resource Grid - making Grids usable *Lee W.

It began serialization in 2002 in Kodansha's Monthly Afternoon. The first bound volume was released in September 2003 in Japan; as of December 2005, the story concluded with five volumes released. The manga was licensed by Del Rey, with the first volume being released on August 30, 2005. The story is about a boy, Hoshino, who to attract the girl he likes, Negishi, chooses to be completely honest. Plot In the middle of class, in front of everybody, Hoshino approaches Negishi (who doesn't even know his name) with \\"Negishi, I like you. Please go out with me\\" and is obviously refused; she refuses to go on a date too, so they settle for walking home together, and the whole class starts laughing and clapping their hands (a leitmotiv in their story, marking every significant advancement in their relationship). The day after their walk, Negishi approaches Hoshino with \\"Hoshino, I like you. Please go out with me.\\" Characters ; : Undoubtedly an honest guy who always says what he thinks. He loved Negishi since the first moment he saw her, because she was saying and doing what he too had in his heart, but he didn't have the courage to act upon according to his feelings; from that moment on, he decided he'd always be honest. ; : The girl Hoshino loves; she has more common sense than he does, and thus she often slaps or punches him out of embarrassment. She gets a little embarrassed when Hoshino's and her relationship is often put on display to the high school public. Negishi is a horrible cook who can barely make any edible food for anyone including Hoshino. She thinks that she is like the tsukkomi in a Manzai, where Hoshino is the boke; in a panel, though, Hoshino claims to be the tsukkomi. ; : Negishi's best friend (Hoshino at first calls her \\"Negishi's friend\\" and never uses her name), intriguing and scheming; she often thinks of absurd plans for Hoshino, and is the primary source of comedy in the story. Although her pranks often make their relationship more difficult, she really roots for them, and accepts going on a double date with Tsukahara, leaving the couple alone as soon as they don't notice. : She is very often depicted drinking tomato (or other vegetables) juice with a straw, or sucking a lollipop. When the class claps their hands, she is often depicted waving her hand like a music director. ; : Hoshino's best friend, cool as the author tags him in the character box. Soon after Hoshino's proposal, he gives him a condom, but Hoshino doesn't understand he was teasing him and thanks him deeply. He represents the rational counterpart to Hoshino. Although he generally sees through Yoko's pranks he stays silent, preferring to be the onlooker. ; : A member of the Occult Research Club, often involved by Yoko in her plans, generally for fortune-telling, as her predictions are always wrong. ; : A member of Tsukahara's band and Hoshino's classmate; likes dirty talk, and his advice to Hoshino is generally sex-related.

It was the oldest tree of that species in the Eastern United States.Severo, Richard; August 14, 2003; New York Champion championtrees.org; retrieved August 14, 2006 (Text here is also found on plaques near the tree). It was thought at first to be a Balm-of-Gilead tree, and lent that name to the surrounding community. By the late 20th century its size had led to consideration of its removal as a potential traffic hazard. The community rallied around efforts to save it, which led to its listing on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000 along with a neighboring house. The state took ownership of the land, making it New York's smallest state forest. However, the tree kept suffering structural problems, and it was finally cut down in 2015. History Local folklore has it that the tree grew when George Washington planted his walking stick while he and the Continental Army were encamped in nearby Newburgh during the final years of the Revolutionary War,Dowd, Joe; August 26, 2005; Folk Tales of the Mid-Hudson , Times-Herald Record; retrieved August 13, 2006 but core samples of the tree have dated its growth to 1699, well before American independence. Franklin Roosevelt often came to visit the tree. In the mid 20th century, it began to suffer the effects of its advanced age and vandalism. In the mid-1970s arborists recommended it be removed as a traffic hazard. However, community groups led by Richard Severo, whose house overlooked the tree, were able to save it, citing its historic value. It has thus received considerable protection from the state and federal governments. An elaborate guy-wire system and adjacent metal pole help support it, and it and the small patch of land on which it grew are protected, both by the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation as a historic site and by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation as a \\"public historic park\\" or state forest,Part 193.2, NYSDEC regulations. making it New York's smallest at 348 square feet (31 m2) in area. It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 2000.List of National Register of Historic Places for Orange County, New York. On March 27, 2009, a group of environmentally minded members of the community gathered around the tree as cherry pickers cut its branches, and gardeners from the Garden Club of Orange and Dutchess Counties and other nature organizations took buds to bring home and nurse in pots until large enough to plant in the ground. Any buds that flourish will be distributed to historically significant sites throughout the Mid Hudson Valley. As the headline of the next edition of The Sentinel proclaimed, \\"Balmville Tree's Longevity Could be Passed on to Descendents\\".Article on page one of The Sentinel newspaper dated March 31, 2009, written by Meghan Fitzpatrick. The Sentinel is a semi-weekly newspaper published in New Windsor, New York. The only people to have successfully propagated a cutting from the Balmville Tree are Richard and Emoke Severo, who live next door to the tree. Of the four attempts the Severos made, after taking cuttings in 1999, the tricentennial of the Balmville Tree, only one survived which they credit to the cutting sharing the same water and soil as the original tree. On August 5, 2015 the tree was cut down and removed by the New York State Department of Environmental Protection, which cited safety concerns. For several weeks prior to the removal, the surrounding roads were closed to traffic due to the rapid deterioration of the tree, including the danger of falling limbs. Residents did not protest, but nevertheless lamented the tree's end. \\"There is no Balmville without the Balmville Tree,\\" one told a local newspaper. A stump remains. It is still a protected area; residents are planning to rededicate it. Many also took cuttings and will plant them in the hope of carrying on the tree genetically. Measurements At the time of its removal it was 25 feet (7.6 m) in circumference at its base, and 83 feet (25 m) high. It once reached as high as 110 feet (33. 5 m), but its crown had to be trimmed after extensive damage from Hurricane Floyd in 1999.Hall, Wayne; October 6, 2000; Balmville Tree risks limb to save life; Times-Herald Record; retrieved August 14, 2006 See also *National Register of Historic Places in Orange County, New York ReferencesExternal links *Balmville at newburghrevealed.org Individual trees in New York (state) National Register of Historic Places in Orange County, New York New York (state) historic sites Newburgh, New York Trees of the Great Lakes region (North America) 2010s individual tree deaths Buildings and structures in Newburgh, New York ","title":"Balmville Tree"},{"id":"6350011","text":"The College of Westchester (CW) is a private for-profit college in White Plains, New York.

Other characters in the Emelan universe do not appear in these books, but appear in The Circle Opens quartet or in The Will of the Empress.  Dedicates and Novices of Winding Circle  Dedicate Crane is the First Dedicate of the Air temple. He is described as \\"the kind of man who draped himself on air\\". He created a greenhouse, in an effort to grow plants all year round. Since he is so good with plants, he is considered Dedicate Rosethorn's rival. They were once lovers. He worked together with Rosethorn in Briar's Book to find the cure for Blue Pox. His given name is Isas, and though abdicated the ties by becoming Innitiated, was a noble in the country of Olart. Dedicate Gorse runs the Winding Circle kitchens. His temple affiliation is not known, as his robes are so stained and scorched their color is unrecognizable. Gorse takes good food and nutrition as his personal mission, frequently giving Briar food between meals and taking great care to feed drained mages well. In a post by Tim Liebe on SheroesCentral he suggests that Gorse and Niko met while they were both imprisoned in Yanjing. Dedicate Henna is a healer who works with Rosethorn and Briar in Urda's House during the Blue Pox plague in Briar's Book. She eventually dies of the plague, the first death among temple dedicates. Kirel is Dedicate Frostpine's first apprentice, the second apprentice being Daja Kisubo. He is a novice of the Fire temple, a non-mage and a blacksmithing apprentice. He is sometimes a little jealous of Daja. When Tris passes out on the beach after trying to stop the tide, Kirel is the one Niko calls to carry her back to the temple. Dedicate Lark lives with Dedicate Rosethorn in Discipline Cottage, a place where kids who need extra help come to stay. Her magic is with thread, and she is very kind to everyone, unlike Rosethorn, who threatens to hang the children in the well if they \\"so much as breathe on a plant\\". She is Sandry's main teacher in thread magic. She and Rosethorn are lovers. Dedicate Superior Moonstream is the head of Winding Circle temple. A healer dedicated to the Water temple, Moonstream is called to treat Dedicate Rosethorn towards the end of the Blue Pox plague, in Briar's Book. Dedicate Osprey is an Air temple Dedicate, and Dedicate Crane's primary helper in his glass-house. Dedicate Rosethorn is an Earth temple dedicate with Ambient plant magic. Along with Dedicate Lark, she runs Discipline Cottage. Her tongue is very sharp and she only abides Briar and Lark, but she does like the girls, even though she doesn't show it. She nearly dies from the bluepox in Briar's Book, then pneumonia brought on by immune deficiency, but it is actually a seizure that kills her before Briar, aided by Tris, Daja and Sandry, retrieve her soul from Death. She was born in Anderran, the country directly west of Emelan, with the given name of Niva. During the time the books take place, or at least the time of Daja's Book, she is thirty-three years old. She and Lark are lovers. Dedicate Skyfire is the First Dedicate of the Fire temple in Winding Circle temple. He is a former general who dedicated himself to the service of the fire gods upon the death of his wife, and in charge of the Temple Guard. He and the Temple Guard appear in Tris's Book, when Winding Circle is under attack by pirates, and has a passing mention in Cold Fire as having taught Daja how to meditate with a staff. Mages Aymery Glassfire is Tris's cousin, a Lightsbridge-educated academic mage who is indebted to pirate captains and siblings Enahar and Pauha. Eilisa Pearldrop is a poor mage living in Summersea's worst quarter. Her failed attempt to earn a living by creating a marketable weight loss potion contaminates Summersea's drinking water, leading to the Blue Pox plague in Briar's Book. Enahar is a pirate and a mage, who bought Aymery Chandler's allegiance by trapping him in debt, and then used his inside help to launch an attack on Winding Circle Temple with his sister Pauha. Their attack is thwarted by the temple mages, and both drown. He appears only in Tris's Book. Yarrun Firetamer is an academic mage working, like his father before him, for Lady Inoulia of Gold Ridge Valley, who disdains Rosethorn's advice that the mountain forests need regular forest fires to preserve their life cycles. His constant attempts to stop any fire from burning in the valley are at first successful, but eventually lead to his death in Daja's Book. Traders Gilav Chandrisa Idaram, the gilav, or leader, of Tenth Caravan Idaram, which is trapped in Gold Ridge Valley during the forest fires in Daja's Book. Polyam's mother. Pirisi, a Trader who was, for unknown reasons, working as Sandry's nurse, and taught her Tradertalk. Sandry's only constant friend in her first ten years, due to her parents traveling around the world. Polyam Idaram, a wirok for Tenth Caravan Idaram, the one who buys all the caravan's needs and disrespected in Trader culture for spending, rather than earning money. Polyam lost an eye and a leg in a mudslide, and had been heavily scarred and unable to ride until meeting Daja Kisubo, who crafted for her a magical/mechanical leg out of the melted brass that fused to her hand in a forest fire. The leg enabled Polyam to ride again, and resume her previous role for the caravan, as a trainer and seller of horses. A post by Tamora Pierce at SheroesCentral has suggested that since Daja's Book, Polyam received from Daja a magical/mechanical eye, similarly constructed from living metal.  Emelanese Nobility  Lady Amiliane fa Landreg is Sandry's mother, Namornese noblewoman who married into the Emelanese ruling family, although not into the direct ruling line. Sandry describes her parents as a cheerful but flighty young couple, disdaining the duties of their nobility to travel the world. Their travels ended in Hatar, when they both succumbed to the plague, leaving their ten-year-old daughter orphaned. Lady Inoulia fa Juzon is Duke Vedris's daughter-in-law and the lady of Gold Ridge Valley, the area of Emelan plighted by drought and forest fires in Daja's Book. Lady Liesa fa Nadlen, a young noblegirl being schooled in Winding Circle, clashes with Sandry in the dining hall over Sandry's request that Daja Kisubo, a commoner and a Trader, dine with her at the nobility's table. Lord Mattin fer Toren is Sandry's father and Duke Vedris's favorite nephew. Sandry describes her parents as a cheerful but flighty young couple, disdaining the duties of their nobility to travel the world. Their travels ended in Hatar, when they both succumbed to the plague, leaving their ten-year-old daughter orphaned. Duke Vedris IV, Sandry's great- uncle and the ruler of Emelan, offers to take her in after her parents die of plague in the island of Hatar. However, Vedris is a widower and a workaholic, and his Citadel strikes Sandry as a grim place to grow up; she embraces his offer to be educated in the nearby temple of Winding Circle. Aside from his appearances in all four Circle of Magic books, Duke Vedris appears extensively in Magic Steps, and briefly in The Will of the Empress. Animal Companions Little Bear is Discipline's family dog, rescued by Sandry in the Summersea market from boys who were abusing him. The dog is quickly adopted by Tris, Daja and Briar after they stand by Sandry's side in the fight that her rescue triggers. In later books Little Bear is a fixture in Discipline Cottage, and he travels with Tris in Shatterglass and receives a cursory mention in The Will of the Empress, as well. Shriek is a nestling that Tris finds while investigating the explosion on a Bit Island with Niko. Despite Niko's protests, Tris brings the abandoned nestling back to Discipline Cottage, where Rosethorn helps her nurse him back to health. Others Darra and Valden Chandler are merchants in the city of Ninver, and Trisana Chandler's parents, who give her away to various relatives and then to Stone Circle temple, because her ambient magic with the weather went unrecognized, and they thought she was possessed or an elemental. Dedicate Superior Huath is the dedicate in charge of Wave Circle Temple in Ragat. His theories on magical conversion (similar to energy conversion) lead him to try and trap the energy of an earthquake in Sandry's Book. The attempt goes wrong and the earthquake spreads and multiplies, reaching Summersea city despite having been projected not to affect Emelan. Pauha is a pirate queen who, with the help of her brother Enahar, launched an attack on Winding Circle Temple in Tris's Book. Their attack is thwarted by the temple mages, and both drown. The Thief Lord, an unnamed man who recruited street-rats in Hajra to be part of his gang. He recruited Briar when he was orphaned at the age of four, and named him Roach.

In 1996 Gauder started suffering from a virus infection of his heart. After living with an artificial heart for several months, he received a heart transplant. He subsequently took part in the New York Marathon several times. Being classified as a disabled participant due to his transplant, he was once disqualified for being too fast as there was a minimum time, which he underran. His recovery from almost dying to returning into a normal life was covered in a documentary shown on German documentary channel Phoenix.

The performance of the engine is decreased in comparison to the original C++ demos, however the original OGRE engine provides such high performance that the performance of Python-Ogre is still more than acceptable for all but the most graphics-intensive games.  Features  Python-Ogre is different from the Ogre3D engine it is based upon as it comes pre-bundled with Python bindings and demos for many other support libraries.  Compatibility  Python-Ogre has compatibility for all platforms supported by OGRE: * Microsoft Windows - Binaries are available at the Python-Ogre forums. * Linux - Build instructions can be found on the Python-Ogre wiki. An Ubuntu binary is currently in development. * Mac OS X - Build instructions can be found on the Python-Ogre wiki. Python-Ogre builds on both Mac OS X 10.4 ‚ÄúTiger‚Äù and Mac OS X 10.5 ‚ÄúLeopard‚Äù.  Support  The Python-Ogre wiki, contains build instructions for Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X platforms, as well as tutorials and example code snippets. Ogre3D hosts the official Python-Ogre forum for helping developers in their use of the engine.  History  The PyOgre project began in early 2005, where a Python binding for OGRE was first attempted using Boost.Python from the Boost C++ Libraries by two members of the Ogre3D community, Clay Culver and Federico Di Gergorio. This effort ultimately failed, which prompted the use of SWIG as the basis for the C++ binding.http://www.ogre3d.org/wiki/index.php/Introduction_to_PyOgre#Brief_History_and_Why_SWIG_.3COutdated.3E Introduction to PyOgre This method proved to be rather successful, providing to the community with a somewhat limited and error-prone implementation, but an implementation nonetheless. In mid-2006, Lakin Wecker began work on Python- Ogre, based on the Boost.Python libraries, as was attempted before. This was developed alongside the PyOgre project. He was aided by Andy Miller, who then later took over development of the project with assistance from Roman Yakovenko, Joseph Lisee, and Ben Harling during the evolution of the engine. Ogre3D Addons Forums - First Release of Python-Ogre Development of PyOgre was halted in mid-2007, and officially succeeded by Python- Ogre.http://www.ogre3d.org/phpBB2addons/viewtopic.php?t=3917 Ogre3D Addons Forums - Python-Ogre official As of summer of 2008, Andy Miller was actively working on adding new features to Python-Ogre, as well as providing support and maintenance. As of January 2014, the main website at python-ogre.org went offline, but wiki.python-ogre.org is still extant.  Included libraries  The following libraries are either currently supported, or have at one point in time worked with the Python-Ogre engine. Support for particular libraries are noted in each release. Demos are available for all libraries listed, however, not all demos function, due to the constantly evolving codebase and limited number of active developers. ; Renderer * Ogre 1.4.9 Legacy version * Ogre 1.5 \\"Shoggoth\\" experimental software build * Ogre 1.6 official release * Ogre 1.7 \\"Cthugha\\" experimental build, including full DirectX 10 support. ; GUI * BetaGUI‚ÄîCompact and lightweight OGRE GUI library * CEGUI‚ÄîFully featured general-purpose videogame GUI library * Navi‚ÄîHTML/CSS/JS-based OGRE GUI library * QuickGUI‚ÄîEasy to use, widget-based OGRE GUI library * Hikari‚ÄîFlash based OGRE GUI library ; I/O * OIS‚ÄîStandard OGRE input library, allowing buffered, object-oriented input ; Audio * OpenAL‚ÄîCross-platform audio API commonly used with Ogre3D ; Physics * Bullet‚ÄîFull-featured physics engine with a feature set similar to that of proprietary libraries, offering both rigid body and soft body collision detection * ODE‚ÄîOpen source rigid body collision detection library * Newton‚ÄîOffers real-world physics simulation, where accuracy and real-world physical parameters are desired over performance and newer features * PhysX‚ÄîPopular, proprietary, high performance, fully featured library ** NxOgre‚ÄîWrapper for the PhysX library and Ogre3D, with an editor and other helpful Ogre3D-oriented features ; Effects * Particle Universe‚ÄîScriptable particle effects engine that helps create complex particle effects easily * Caelum‚ÄîRealistic sky, atmosphere, weather and lighting simulation * LibNoise‚ÄîPortable, open-source, coherent noise-generating library ReferencesExternal links * Python-Ogre wiki * Downloads from SourceForge * Archive of Python-Ogre.org * Official Python-Ogre forum * Python-Ogre Google Group * Ohloh page Free 3D graphics software Free computer libraries Python (programming language) libraries Python (programming language)-scriptable game engines ","title":"Python-Ogre"},{"id":"6350047","text":"Garankuwa United, sometimes also spelled Ga-Rankuwa United, is a semi- professional association football club based in the Garankuwa township of Pretoria, in the Gauteng province of South Africa. The club was founded (or revived) in July 2004, to play their first season in the SAFA Regional League. In June 2005, the owners Dingi Rahlagane and Harold \\"Kaizer\\" Motaung, decided to acquire the Castle League franchise of the club Buffaloes, based in the North-West province of Vodacom League, which provided the team an automatic promotion to this level for 2005‚Äì06. The team's debut season in Vodacom League was very successful, as they managed both to win the North-West province, and get promoted after the provincial play-offs, to play the next two seasons in the National First Division. By June 2007, they were however relegated back again to the North-West province of Vodacom League. They managed again to win the province, both in 2010 and 2011, but today still play in Vodacom League, as they were not yet able to also win the promotional tickets at the provincial play-offs. Prehistoric team: Ga-Rankuwa United (1960‚Äì92) The current Garankuwa United team, is said to have been founded in June 2005, as a phoenix team of the previous club Ga-Rankuwa United (1960‚Äì92). When the prehistoric team got founded in the early 1960s, it initially had the name ABC FC. Later it changed to Wallabies FC, before the club settled with their final name Ga-Rankuwa United. The team did not compete at the high level in South Africa, but only in various domestic regional leagues, like i.e. the Bopsol league organised by the Bophuthatswana government. Club records and best achievements * Achieved an 11th place of the National First Division in 2006‚Äì07. * Reached the 1/8-Finals (round 16) of the 2007 ABSA Cup, where they narrowly were defeated 1‚Äì2 by Dynamos. * Won the North West province of Vodacom League in 2006, 2010 and 2011.

The Ram√≥n Allones logo  History  The brand was created in Cuba by brothers Ram√≥n and Antonio Allones (no relation to the Antonio Allones of El Rey del Mundo fame) in 1845 and is supposedly the first cigar brand to have utilized colorful lithographs for box art, the first brand to utilize bands on cigars, and the first to package cigars in the \\"8-9-8\\" style (though there are several rival claimants as to who first made box art and bands). The brand went through numerous ownership changes before it was finally bought by the Cifuentes family and production was moved to the famous Partag√°s Factory, where Ram√≥n Allones cigars are still made to this day. On September 15, 1960, the revolutionary Cuban government nationalized all Cuban cigar manufacturing and production, including seizure of the Partagas factory where Ramon Allones cigars were manufactured.Savona, David, The Exodus, Cigar Aficionado, Nov/Dec. 2002 The Ramon Allones brand was selected for continued production and continues to be manufactured in Havana. Cuban-made Ramon Allones cigars use are medium-full to full strength in body, and the blend shares some of the characteristics of Partag√°s as far as overall body, vitolas, and packaging. It has always been produced in smaller quantities than Partag√°s. Since 2001, when Altadis bought a controlling share of Habanos SA, the Ram√≥n Allones marque has seen the majority of its manufactured sizes discontinued, including the much- beloved Coronas and even the 8-9-8 size it helped pioneer. Of the sizes available now, the Specially Selected, Gigantes, and Small Club Coronas are still incredibly popular among aficionados. Since 2005, Ram√≥n Allones has been a popular choice with many importers for the Edici√≥n Regional series of local market special sizes. The Belicoso vitola released for the UK market may have been a prototype for the regional edition program, as it appeared first, being imported only to the UK, and without any additional bands or special packaging. Vitolas in the Ram√≥n Allones Line The following list of vitolas de salida (commercial vitolas) within the Ram√≥n Allones marque lists their size and ring gauge in Imperial (and Metric), their vitolas de galera (factory vitolas), and their common name in American cigar slang.

It opened at the Albery Theatre, London on 16 February 1995, starring Stephen Fry and Rik Mayall, with Gray himself directing. Despite having performed successfully for several weeks during the pre-London warm-up dates in Guildford and Watford then at the Richmond Theatre, Fry left the West End production after three days. His understudy, Mark Anderson stepped in, until Fry was replaced by Simon Ward. Nevertheless, the production closed on 25 March 1995. Later in 1995, Gray released an autobiographical account of the production, called Fat Chance. It was published by Faber and Faber. The play was revived at the Hampstead Theatre in December 2017, in a new production directed by Edward Hall and starring Geoffrey Streatfeild as George Blake.  Plot  The play concerns George Blake, who has been convicted for spying for the Russians and sentenced to forty-two years imprisonment, and a fellow prisoner, Sean Bourke. Bourke helps Blake escape to Moscow, after which Blake does not want to let Bourke leave Moscow to return to his native Ireland.  Controversy  In 1995, Stephen Fry famously walked out of the play near the start of its West End run, after his performance received a bad review in the Financial Times. It was reported at the time that he suffered an attack of stage fright, but he has since disclosed that it was bipolar disorder. Fry walked out of the production for good, leaving only an apology, and provoking its early closure. Simon Gray described Fry's action as \\"cowardly\\", and in a statement to the press said: \\"It is disgraceful that so much media attention has been devoted to this squalid little story . . . I confess my own failure as a director was to have cast Stephen Fry in the first place, and in the second place, not to have acknowledged my error by requesting his departure after his (self-proclaimed) inadequacies were abundantly clear to me.\\" In response to the suggestion his reaction was insensitive to Fry's predicament, Gray added: \\"I'm a friend of Stephen's. I have great sympathy because he was hurt and stressed, but what he left behind him was the most awful chaos and distress for other people who loved him, including me.\\" Fry disappeared from the public eye, travelling to Belgium, and contemplating suicide. His personal website says, \\"The experience still haunts him, but the depression has now faded to embarrassment and the anger to forgiveness.\\"  References  British plays 1995 plays West End plays ","title":"Cell Mates (play)"},{"id":"6350101","text":"Mehul M.

On 13 March 1871, Hugo's 44-year-old son Charles died of a stroke while riding in a carriage to a farewell dinner for some of Victor's friends at a restaurant in Bordeaux. Charles's wife died shortly afterwards, and Victor Hugo became the guardian of their children, Georges and Jeanne Hugo.

Love and tenderness are celebrated, discipline is discounted; the freshness and laughter of the young soften the potential bleakness of old age. A trip to the zoo sets the poet musing.

They have been used by indigenous peoples worldwide and are still in use in areas of South America, Africa and Asia. Notable examples are the poisons secreted from the skin of the poison dart frog, and curare (or 'ampi'), a general term for a range of plant-derived arrow poisons used by the indigenous peoples of South America. Poisoned arrows have featured in mythology, notably the Greek story of Heracles slaying the centaur Nessus using arrows poisoned with the blood of the Lernaean Hydra. The Greek hero Odysseus poisons his arrows with hellebore in Homer's Odyssey. Poisoned arrows also figure in Homer's epic about the Trojan War, the Iliad, in which both Achaeans and Trojans used toxic arrows and spears. Poisoned arrows is referred to in the Book of Job in the Bible.Job 6:4 The modern terms \\"toxic\\" and \\"toxin\\" derive from the ancient Greek word for \\"bow\\", toxon, from Old Persian *taxa-, \\"an arrow\\".http://www.aarc.org/resources/biological/history.asp , A History of Biological Warfare from 300 B.C.E. to the Present, Retrieved August 7, 2012.http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=toxic, Online Etymology Dictionary, Retrieved August 7, 2012.http://www.thefreedictionary.com/toxic, The Free Dictionary, Retrieved August 7, 2012. Poison arrows were used by real people in the ancient world, including the Gauls, ancient Romans, and the nomadic Scythians and Soanes. Ancient Greek and Roman historians describe recipes for poisoning projectiles and historical battles in which poison arrows were used. Alexander the Great encountered poisoned projectiles during his conquest of India (probably dipped in the venom of Russell's viper) and the army of the Roman general Lucullus suffered grievous poison wounds from arrows shot by nomads during the Third Mithridatic War (1st century BC). In the Kingdom of Kush, arrows were often poison-tipped. There is some indication that poisoned arrows were used in battle against the Romans from 27 BC to 22 BC.David Nicolle, Angus McBride. 1991. Rome's Enemies 5: The Desert Frontier. p. 11-15 The use of poisoned arrows in hunting and warfare by some Native Americans has also been documented. Over the ages, Chinese warfare has included projectiles poisoned with various toxic substances. Varieties Arrow poisons around the world are created from many sources: Plant-based poisons Strychnos toxifera, a plant commonly used in the preparation of curare *Curare is a generic term for arrow poisons that contain tubocurarine, curarine, quinine, protocurarine and related alkaloids. Most frequently it is derived from the bark of Strychnos toxifera, S. guianensis (family Loganiaceae), Chondrodendron tomentosum or Sciadotenia toxifera (family Menispermaceae). Curare is a competitive antagonist that blocks nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on the post synaptic membrane of the neuromuscular junction. It is a muscle relaxant that causes death by paralyzing the respiratory system, resulting in asphyxiation. *In Africa, many arrow poisons are made from plants that contain cardiac glycosides, such as Acokanthera (possessing ouabain), oleander (Nerium oleander), milkweeds (Asclepias), or Strophanthus, all of which are in the family Apocynaceae. Inee or onaye is a poison made from Strophanthus hispidus, which contains the cardiac glycoside strophanthin. It is used in sub-Saharan West Africa, particularly in the areas of Togo and Cameroon. Certain species of the genus Mostuea (family Gelsemiaceae) are used as additives to arrow poisons (other ingredients unspecified). The toxic principles of Mostuea are alkaloids, not cardiac glycosides. Quattrocchi, Umberto (2012). CRC World dictionary of medicinal and poisonous plants: common names, scientific names, eponyms, synonyms and etymology. Vol. IV, M-Q. CRC Press Taylor and Francis Group. page 2564. *Poisoned arrows are used widely in the jungle areas of Assam, Burma and Malaysia. The main plant sources for the poisons are members of the genera Antiaris, Strychnos and Strophanthus. Antiaris toxicaria for example, a tree of the mulberry and breadfruit family, is commonly used on Java and its neighbouring islands. The sap or juice of the seeds is smeared on the arrowhead on its own or mixed with other plant extracts. The fast-acting active ingredient (either antiarin, strychnine or strophanthin) attacks the central nervous system causing paralysis, convulsions and cardiac arrest. *Several species of Aconitum or \\"aconite,\\" belonging to the buttercup family, have been used as arrow poisons. The Minaro in Ladakh use A. napellus on their arrows to hunt Siberian ibex; they were in use recently near lake Issyk Kul in Kyrgyzstan. The Ainus in Japan used a species of Aconitum to hunt brown bear. It was also used by the Butias and Lepchas in Sikkim and Assam. The Chinese used Aconitum poisons both for hunting and warfare.Chavannes, √âdouard. ‚ÄúTrois G√©n√©raux Chinois de la dynastie des Han Orientaux. Pan Tch‚Äôao (32-102 p.C.); ‚Äì son fils Pan Yong; ‚Äì Leang K‚Äôin (112 p.C.). Chapitre LXXVII du Heou Han chou.‚Äù. 1906. T‚Äôoung pao 7, pp. 226-227. *The Caribs of the Caribbean used poisons made from the sap of the manchineel tree (Hippomane mancinella) or sandbox tree (Hura crepitans), both members of the spurge family, Euphorbiaceae. Animal-based poisons black-legged dart frog, a species of poison dart frog whose secretions are used in the preparation of poison darts. *In South America, tribes such as the Noanam√° Choc√≥ and Ember√° Choc√≥ of western Colombia dip the tips of their blowgun darts in the poison found on the skin of three species of Phyllobates, a genus of poison dart frog. In northern Choc√≥ Department, Phyllobates aurotaenia is used, while P. bicolor is used in Risaralda Department and southern Choc√≥. In Cauca Department, only P. terribilis is used for dart making. The poison is generally collected by roasting the frogs over a fire, but the batrachotoxins in P. terribilis are powerful enough that it is sufficient to dip the dart in the back of the frog without killing it. *In the northern Kalahari Desert, the most commonly used arrow poison is derived from the larva and pupae of beetles of the genus Diamphidia. It is applied to the arrow either by squeezing the contents of the larva directly onto the arrow head, mixing it with plant sap to act as an adhesive, or by mixing a powder made from the dried larva with plant juices and applying that to the arrow tip. The toxin is slow attacking and large animals can survive 4‚Äì5 days before succumbing to the effects. *In the United States, Native American tribes used venomous reptiles to provide the poisons required. In the Southwest United States, the Gila monster, being one of the only two venomous lizards, has been used as a source. There is evidence of Pacific Island cultures using poison arrow and spear tips. An account from Hector Holthouse's book \\"Cannibal Cargoes\\" P.141 (on the subject of the Australian Pacific Island Labour Trade) describes a canoe, resting on forks in the sand; within the canoe the body of a man rotting in the sun. The unsealed canoe allowing the putrefaction to collect in a knotched shallow bowl in which arrow heads and spear tips are soaked. Wounds with these weapons caused tetanus infection. Preparation The following 17th-century account describes how arrow poisons were prepared in China: Native American tribes would agitate the snake or lizard until it repeatedly struck into the spoiled meat or liver of an animal, impregnating it with its toxin. The tips of arrows or the blowgun darts were then dipped into the poisoned meat.

He played as a loose forward, and was part of the Great Britain squad which won the 1960 World Cup. He forged a fearsome reputation as a strong runner of the ball and a devastating tackler. He was also highly regarded as a brilliant passer of the ball, often doing so with one of his large hands. Club career Vince Karalius was born in Widnes, Lancashire, England. He was one of eight children born to a Scottish father and an Irish mother; his paternal grandparents were Lithuanian. Three of his brothers, Terry, Denis and Tony, also went on to become rugby league players. He started playing for West Bank ARLFC in Widnes at the age of 15, before signing professionally for St. Helens in 1951. He made his d√©but against Warrington in April 1952, and his first try was against the now defunct Liverpool City in that same time. His intimidating presence became a telling feature of his play. Respected for his ferocious attitude on the pitch, he was dubbed 'the Wild Bull of the Pampas' by the Australian press, in reference to the Argentine boxer Luis √Ångel Firpo, who had knocked World Heavyweight Boxing Champion Jack Dempsey out of the ring back in 1923. It took until the 1955‚Äì56 season for Karalius to establish himself as a St. Helens regular, although a significant part of the 31 games he played that season were in the second row. Many were quick to focus on Karalius' mean defensive play, but his value to St. Helens was also evident in attack where he combined rugby nous with delicate handling skills to distribute effectively. Vince Karalius played in St. Helens' 13‚Äì2 victory over Halifax in the 1956 Challenge Cup Final during the 1955‚Äì56 season at Wembley Stadium, London on Saturday 28 April 1956, in front of a crowd of 79,341. 1956‚Äì57 was a watershed season for Karalius. He accumulated 18 tries, no mean feat for a forward, and was a member of the St. Helens side which hammered the Australian touring side by 44‚Äì2. Karalius was acknowledged for his contributions to St. Helens' success, including the 1959 'Vollenhoven' Championship Final win by 44‚Äì22 over Hunslet. When Alan Prescott retired from the game, Karalius was seen by some as the natural successor to the captaincy of St. Helens. During this period, Vince Karalius played , and was the captain in St. Helens' 12‚Äì6 victory over Wigan in the 1961 Challenge Cup Final during the 1960‚Äì61 season at Wembley Stadium, London, on Saturday, 13 May 1961, in front of a crowd of 94,672. The first occasion that he lifted a trophy for the club was in season 1960‚Äì61 at Central Park, Wigan when St Helens won the Lancashire County Cup by 15‚Äì9 against Swinton. St. Helens repeated this in the same competition in the following four years (1961‚Äì62, 1962‚Äì63 and 1964‚Äì65 v Swinton and 1963‚Äì64 v Leigh). Vince Karalius played in St. Helens' 16‚Äì8 victory over Wigan in the 1953 Lancashire County Cup Final during the 1953‚Äì54 season at Station Road, Swinton on Saturday 24 October 1953, played in the 3‚Äì10 defeat by Oldham in the 1956 Lancashire County Cup Final during the 1956‚Äì57 season at Central Park, Wigan, on Saturday 20 October 1956, played in the 2‚Äì12 defeat by Oldham in the 1958 Lancashire County Cup Final during the 1958‚Äì59 season at Station Road, Swinton Saturday 25 October 1958, played , and was captain in the 15‚Äì9 victory over Swinton in the 1960 Lancashire County Cup Final during the 1960‚Äì61 season at Station Road, Swinton Saturday 29 October 1960, and played , and was captain in the 25‚Äì9 victory over Swinton in the 1961 Lancashire County Cup Final during the 1960‚Äì61 season at Station Road, Swinton Saturday 11 November 1961. Although at St. Helens, Vince Karalius did not appear in the 5‚Äì22 defeat by Leigh in the 1952 Lancashire County Cup Final during the 1952‚Äì53 season at Station Road, Swinton on Saturday 29 November 1952, and the 5‚Äì4 defeat by Warrington in the 1959 Lancashire County Cup Final during the 1959‚Äì60 season at Central Park, Wigan Saturday 31 October 1959, the 7-4 victory over Swinton in the 1962 Lancashire County Cup Final during the 1962‚Äì63 season at Central Park, Wigan Saturday 27 October 1962. By 1961‚Äì62, St Helens embarked on a rebuilding period as they searched for a new generation of players to press for honours. It would appear that Vince Karalius lay outside those plans when he was sold to his hometown club Widnes in 1962. His last match for St. Helens was against Leeds on January of that year. In all, Karalius appeared in 252 matches for St Helens. He scored 42 tries for 126 points. Despite the move, Karalius would always be remembered by fans and players alike. Alex Murphy acknowledged the support and protection Karalius offered him during their time playing at St Helens. Indeed, according to Murphy: :‚ÄúHe was my loose forward and he was unbelievable to have on your side. If he said it was Christmas, you took his word for it whatever time of year it was ‚Äì it was Christmas.‚Äù After his move to Naughton Park in 1962, Karalius was appointed club captain. This was a role that Karalius was determined to excel in. Commenting on the move, he revealed the work ethic that was such a foundation for his rugby talent: :\\"Some players come back to spend their last seasons at their own hometown club like horses being put to grass. I came back to Widnes determined to give 100% effort.\\" In his first season at Widnes, he helped his hometown team finish third in the Championship, which equalled the club's best league placing. The following season, saw him lead his team to Wembley, where Widnes were Challenge Cup winners, this was the Widnes' first trophy success in eighteen years. In 1966 he announced his retirement. Vince Karalius played , and was captain in Widnes' 13-5 victory over Hull Kingston Rovers in the 1964 Challenge Cup Final during the 1963‚Äì64 season at Wembley Stadium, London on Saturday 9 May 1964, in front of a crowd of 84,488. International career and the \\"Battle of Brisbane\\" At 25, Karalius was selected to make the 1958 Tour to Australia ‚Äì a tour that would go down in rugby league history. It was during the \\"Battle of Brisbane\\" in 1958 at the Brisbane Exhibition Ground, when Alan Prescott led the Lions to victory with a broken arm that the Karalius \\"hardman\\" status was well and truly enshrined. With Prescott in agony with a broken arm, Karalius was also in trouble with an injury to his back. Tour Manager Tom Mitchell recalls in his book, The Memories and Sporting Life of Tom Mitchell: :\\"The team went out with Karalius at the far side of the dressing room still on the bench. \\"Vinty we are out. Come on\\" \\"Sorry, Thomas, can't ‚Äì it's me back\\". I got in behind him and did enough to get him standing up. Slowly across the room to the sunlit opening leading to the pitch ‚Äì then a step or two and like a boxer getting up after a knockdown, he teetered with a push onto the arena, gaining movement with every stride. Without him on the field the position was the same as the captain ‚Äì certain defeat. How he stood up to the first ten minutes I will never know as my eyes steered their gaze from him to Prescott. As I write this 39 years on I permit myself a heartfelt \\"Phew! No Ashes! No basking in the future unending sunshine of happening to be there as Team Manager\\". During this tour, one Australian was moved to write: :\\"Long-jawed Vince Karalius, the wild bull of the Pampas, is a dedicated wrecker of Australian forwards.\\" Thereafter, the nickname stuck and Karalius was firmly embedded in the sporting public's conscience as what a rugby league forward should represent. Karalius represented Great Britain 10 times in his time with St. Helens. He also won five Lancashire caps. Retirement Six years after he retired from playing Karalius returned to Widnes ‚Äì as coach, appointed in January 1972. Karalius imposed onto the club his own values and visions: fitness, determination and winning. He aimed to turn the club into a force, a vision that was achieved as early as 1974‚Äì75. First Salford were beaten in the Lancashire County Cup Final and then rivals Warrington were defeated in the Challenge Cup. This was the first time in their history that Widnes had recorded two trophies in the same season. At his zenith, Karalius stepped down once from his role as coach. He was replaced in May 1975 by Frank Myler. He returned to the club for a short spell in March 1983 as co-coach with Harry Dawson. Dawson quit as coach in March 1984 with Karalius continuing as team manager. Vince Karalius was the coach in Widnes' 19-6 victory over Wigan in the 1984 Challenge Cup Final during the 1983‚Äì84 season at Wembley Stadium, London on Saturday 5 May 1984, in front of a crowd of 80,116. Karalius was also one of the original thirteen former Widnes players inducted into the Widnes Hall of Fame in 1992. In 2000, he became the first forward to be inducted into the British Rugby League Hall of Fame. After retiring from rugby league, Karalius forged a successful scrap metal business. He was a resident of the Isle of Man, where he died 13 December 2008 aged 76.

Of the follow-up books, only Magic Steps of the quartet The Circle Opens and the opening sequence of the standalone book The Will of the Empress take place in Emelan. Geography=Overview The map of Emelan and the surrounding countries is noticeably based on the Mediterranean and Middle Eastern regions, both in geographical features and in culture. Emelan itself resides on the northern shore of the Pebbled Sea, the fictional equivalent of the Mediterranean Sea. Its location parallels that of Greece on the world map, extending a peninsula surrounded by many islands of various sizes into the sea. However, Emelan seems to extend over a larger and more diverse territory. Notable locations in Emelan # Summersea, Emelan's capital city, is home to Duke Vedris IV, Pasco Acalon and Yazm√≠n Hebet. ## The Mire is the city's poorest district, outside the city walls. Much of the plot of Briar's Book takes place in Urda's House, a volunteer-run hospital in the Mire. # Winding Circle, a temple-city of the Living Circle religion just outside Summersea. Winding Circle is a center for the learning of ambient magic, equivalent to Lightsbridge university for academic magic. While the temple serves as a school for the general population, once students are sixteen they must enter novitiate in the temple, or leave. ## Discipline Cottage is a house run by Dedicate Rosethorn and Dedicate Lark, and serves as home to 'special cases', such as powerful ambient mages, or students who don't get along with the general studentry during their education. The Circle of Magic quartet tales place primarily in Discipline, during the education of the four protagonists. # Gold Ridge Valley, a mountainous county in the north of Emelan, the setting of Daja's Book. The valley draws the wealth it is named after from its saffron crocus beds and copper mines, but at the time in which the book takes place had been suffering a three-year drought that severely damaged the crocus plants, and its mines were depleted. The valley's economy was restored when new copper beds were discovered, and a magical working melted some of the Dalburz glacier using the heat of a forest fire. Neighboring countries # Sotat (birthland of Briar Moss) to the east. Sotat's capital is Hajra. Hajra's poorest quarter is called Deadman's District, and is the place where Briar spent most of his childhood. # Qalai to the north-east. # Lairan to the north. # Gansar to the north-west. # Anderran (birthland of Dedicate Rosethorn) to the west. Other countries in the Emelan Universe # Capchen, birthland of Trisana Chandler, and its capital city, Ninver (name possibly derived from the biblical city of Nineveh, from the Book of Jonah). The temple city of Stone Circle, where Niklaren Goldeye found Tris, is located outside of Ninver. # Hatar Island, an island in the Pebbled Sea where Niklaren Goldeye finds Sandry after both her parents died of smallpox. # The Empire of Namorn, birthland of Sandry's mother, the setting of Cold Fire and the 2005 standalone novel The Will of the Empress. ## Cold Fire is set in Kugisko, a Namornese city of brightly painted wooden buildings and frozen canals. Pierce has said that she based Kugisko on the Russian city of St. Petersburg.Pullman, Pierce and Paulini interview , Dave Weich, Powells.com Interviews, retrieved February 19, 2007. ## The Will of the Empress is set in various Namornese locations, including the capital city of Dancruan, and Sandry's ancestral holding, Clehamat Landreg. # Chammur, an emirate owing de jure allegiance to Sotat, the setting of Street Magic, the second book in The Circle Opens quartet. Pierce has cited the Jordanian city of Petra as her inspiration for Chammur.Where do you get your ideas? official site FAQ, retrieved August 10, 2006. # Tharios, a city state far to the south of the Pebbled Sea, the setting of Shatterglass, the fourth book in The Circle Opens quartet. ## Khapik is Tharios city's entertainment district, home to the fifth caste, the yaskedasi, and the location of the murders that take place in Shatterglass. # Olart, a country north of the Pebbled Sea, is the birthland of Dedicate Crane, the younger son of a count in that country. # Mbau, a country south of the Pebbled Sea, is the birthland of Dedicate Frostpine. # Yanjing, a country based upon China that is ruled by Emperor Weishu. Yanjing is frequently at war with Namorn, and its other neighbors as shown in Battle Magic and The Will of the Empress. # Gyongxe, a neighboring country to Yanjing. Dedicate Rosethorn, Briar Moss, and Evumeimei Dingzai travel there in Battle Magic. History and politics=The Kurchal Empire All countries between Namorn in the north and Tharios in the south were once a part of the Kurchal Empire, and the language common to these areas is still called Imperial or Imperial Kurchali. Chammur seems to be the exception to this, since in Street Magic Briar Moss takes pains to learn the Chammuri language, and debates about whether or not he should teach his student Evvy to read and write it. This may be for the same reason that Sotat does not enforce its sovereignty over Chammur, since it is located in a distant, mountainous desert. As well, the fall of the Kurchal Empire gave rise to the term \\"K.F.\\" after the listing of a date, such as 1041 K.F., as frequently mentioned in The Will of the Empress. This probably refers to the term A.D. (in comparison to B.C.) in the Western world. Politics of Emelan Emelan is a sovereign duchy with an extensive noble class. The inheritance of the ducal throne seems to be combined with a merit system; references in The Will of the Empress reveal that Duke Vedris IV, the current ruler of Emelan, has the power to choose his own heir, through rumors that he is considering displacing his third son (Franzen fer Toren, mentioned in passing and listed in the book's glossary) in favor of his grandniece, protagonist Sandrilene fa Toren. Politics of other countries Most countries in the Emelan Universe have monarchic systems of government: Namorn is an empire ruled by Empress Berenene dor Ocmore, Yanjing is an empire (possibly based on China, as it is called the Empire of Silk) ruled by Emperor Weishu, Chammur is an emirate and the noble class is abundant almost everywhere. One prominent exception to this rule is the city state of Tharios, which is ruled by an Assembly, although it, too is an oligarchy effectively ruled by the first and highest caste. The caste system in Tharios operates on a principle of divine privilege similar to the one nobility works on. Known conflicts in the world of Emelan include: # Invasion of Gyonxe by the Yanjing Empire, referenced by Briar in The Will of the Empress. Battle Magic shows Briar, Rosethorn, and Evumeimei Dingzai shortly before and during this invasion. # Ongoing war between Namorn and Yanjing in the Sea of Grass in north-eastern Namorn, referenced multiple times throughout The Will of the Empress. Culture The culture around the Pebbled Sea is strongly based on that of the Middle East. While most locations visited in the books are ethnically mixed, showing characters of apparent Chinese, black, caucasian, Indian, Middle Eastern and multiracial ethnicities, some of the clothing and most of the food consumed in the region have a strong Middle Eastern flavor.Cultural basis of countries in the Circle books, Tamora Pierce and Tim Liebe, Sheroes Central, 2003-02-26,retrieved February 19, 2007. The cuisine favors chickpeas, \\"flatbread\\", couscous and baklawa, among other things. By contrast, the Namornese culture has a distinct Russian overtone,The Circle Opens Discussion Guide , Rosemary B. Stimola, Scholastic Corporation website, retrieved February 19, 2007. and the culture of Tharios is mixed; its city state status and democratic tradition have roots in ancient Greece (as well as many Tharian words being very similar to Greek words - shenos/xenos, kyten/chiton), the caste system is based not on the Indian caste system but on the Japanese Burakumin, and the pleasure district of Khapik is based on traditional Japanese geisha. Religion=The Living Circle The temple of Winding Circle belongs to the fictional religion, the Living Circle. It is a polytheistic. nature-worshipping religion, based on the classical elements system of air, fire, water and earth, with two gods, one male and one female, dedicated to each element.Who are the gods in your Universes? , official site, 2003, retrieved August 13, 2006. A temple is dedicated to each of the four elements within each Living Circle temple-city. The philosophy of the Living Circle is based on harmony and balance, and opposition of fanaticism. Liberal about sex in general and homosexuality in particular, Dedicates of the Living Circle are not celibate, but are discouraged from pursuing either marriage or children at the expense of their devotion to their gods.The Living Circle, Tim Liebe, Sheroes Central, 2004-01-03, retrieved August 13, 2006. > While the Living Circle doesn't discourage sex (though some Air temple > devotees, particularly the most purely intellectual ones, don't go for it > because it messes up their thought processes, and they spend their days > trying to become purely creatures of the mind) (no, Crane is not one of > those--he likes plants, remember!), the temples do discourage > handfasting/marriage and having children, because legal relationships and > children tend to distract the mind and spirit from complete devotion to the > gods.

Tim Liebe on the Living Circle, SheroesCentral, January 3, 2004. Other Gods Various minor, specialized gods exist alongside the worship of the Living Circle. These include trickster gods dedicated to thieves such as Lakik, gods of law enforcement such as Harrier the Clawed, and other professional gods. Traders have two gods, Trader Koma and Bookkeeper Oti, and also pay homage to their ancestors with religious ceremony, altars and incense. Namorn has its own pantheon of gods, which is also, to an extent, base on the classical elements. Hospitals are named after Yorgiry, the goddess of healing. Tharios worships the All-Seeing, and an assortment of minor gods. Types of magic=Academic magic Academic magic follows the traditional fantasy genre rules for use of magic. It is a potential that only exists in some individuals, born mages, which can be detected by magic sniffers, sight- mages who specialize in discovering children with magical potential. Magical education may take place in temples, such as Winding Circle, or universities, such as Lightsbridge. At some point during the training the mages choose their own specialty, and once their training is complete they receive a certificate in the form of a medallion bearing their specialty and the names of their primary teachers. Mages are also entitled to choose new surnames for themselves that will declare their specialty to potential employers. Niklaren Goldeye chose his name because his specialty is seeing things that most people, even other mages, cannot see. By contrast, all four protagonists of the series have chosen to keep their given names‚Äîalthough Briar Moss merely kept the name he chose when Niklaren found him. Ambient magic Ambient magic, although it also exists as a potential from birth and cannot be manufactured, operates on a different principle. It is tied to a specific craft, power or raw material, ranging from carpentry to dance to weather. Ambient mages can only work with the craft their magic is tied to. Ambient mages are rarer than academic ones, at a ratio of about one to four. Both the Circle of Magic and The Circle Opens series focus on the mechanics of ambient magic, shifting viewpoints to show several different types. The existence of ambient mages is one of the reasons why magic is such a commonplace thing in the Emelan Universe. It manifests as just another aspect of an artisan's expertise, and exemplifies the philosophy that magic exists in all things, no matter how seemingly mundane. This distinguishes it from other fantastical magic systems, which often manifest as fire or lightning, but rarely as weaving, smithing and other daily crafts.

Plot summary=Empress Berenene The primary plot of the novel is the struggle of Sandrilene fa Toren, a half- Namornese noblewoman, against her cousin, Empress Berenene of Namorn; Sandry had inherited the vast Namornese estate of Landreg from her mother, who had accustomed her to receiving a yearly income from the estate while rarely visiting it. Empress Berenene, who wants to keep the revenue from the estate within Namorn, repeatedly invites Sandry to visit her court in Dancruan while levying increasing taxes from her estate. When Sandry realizes that the Empress has been threatening Namorn's amicable trade with Emelan, she decides to accept the Empress's invitation and use the visit to visit her estate and Namornese family. Sandry's uncle, Duke Vedris of Emelan, asks her childhood companions Daja Kisubo, Trisana Chandler and Briar Moss who have just come back from their travels to accompany her in lieu of a company of guards, a gesture both discourteous and ineffectual. Though their friendship with Sandry and with each other has become strained since their return to Summersea after years of world-traveling, Daja, Tris and Briar agree, and the four travel to Namorn together. While there, they learn of the Western Namornese custom of bride kidnapping, which entails a man kidnapping a prospective bride and holding her captive until she agrees to sign a wedding contract. While the so- called \\"horse's rump\\" wedding is usually only used to bypass reluctant families or out of a sense of adventure, some marriages are forced, and the custom remains legal. Empress Berenene has never attempted to illegalize it despite having twice been kidnapped, because she believes her ability to escape both times means that only weak women would allow themselves to be forced into a marriage they don't want. When he hears of this, Briar comments that the Empress's captors are unlikely to have used the same level of violence as a common woman might encounter. Because of their power and renown, Empress Berenene decides that Namorn stands to benefit if she persuades all four mages to remain in her court, in addition to Sandry and the funds from her Namornese estate. She offers Tris a position as a court mage with a large salary and benefits including access to the Imperial library, attempting to appeal to her merchant upbringing and her known bibliophily. She appeals to Briar by inviting him to her fantastic private greenhouses, offering him unlimited access as her personal gardener and showing him public favor, including an earldom. To entice Sandry to remain in court, she sends an entourage of four young nobles to escort her to Clehamat Landreg, including Finlach fer Hurich and Jakuben fer Pennun, who openly compete in their courtship of Sandry. Daja develops a relationship with Berenene's beautiful seamstress, Rizuka fa Dalach, which is encouraged by the Empress in order to keep Daja in Namorn. When Fin, frustrated by Sandry's reluctance, kidnaps her with the aid of his uncle, locking her in a magic-proof box in the Julih Tunnel, a secret part of the castle, Sandry reconnects her magical bond with Briar while he is at a dance with Caidy, calling out to him for help. Briar and Tris succeed in extracting Sandry, and they decide to leave Namorn despite Empress Berenene's efforts to dissuade them and the incarceration of Fin and his uncle, until then the head of the Dancruan Mages' Society. The Empress then orders Ishabal Ladyhammer, her most powerful war-mage, to prevent the four from leaving to save face, and Ishabal casts a curse on Tris, causing her to fall down the stairs and fracture most of her bones. The injured Tris insists that Sandry, Daja and Briar travel ahead of her, and she catch up to them when she recovers. Halfway to the border with Anderran Sandry is again kidnapped, this time by Pershan fer Roth, whose proposal of marriage she had refused shortly before leaving Dancruan, and Quenaill Shieldsman, a powerful court mage and Shan's rival for the Empress's attentions. Quen lays a powerful sleeping spell on Briar and Daja and magic-dampening spells on Sandry. Briar uses smelling salts he calls \\"Wake the Dead\\" to wake up Daja and they start to go after Sandry when they are confronted by Quenaill. Briar and Daja engage Quenaill, draining him until the spells on Sandry wear off. When Sandry wakes up, she is covered in charms to prevent her from using her magic. These charms are tied to her with ribbons and she is thus able to free herself. Sandry then uses thread magic to unravel her captors' clothing and cocoon them in the resulting threads. After meeting up with Daja and Briar again, the party continue to the border. Aware that the empress may attempt to stop them, they send ahead their traveling companions and send their guards home. At the border, they are confronted by Ishabal Ladyhammer. She raises a barrier against them, but Sandry uses the circle of thread that binds them together to combine their powers. Tris, who had been travelling behind, magically accesses the ring from a distance, allowing the four mages to use their amplified power to shatter the border barrier. The thread circle disappears and all four now have a circular lump in their hand. Having invested much of her power in the barrier, Ishabal is magically drained when she leaves without attempting to stop Tris from crossing. The Circle Reforged The original title of the novel, The Circle Reforged, refers to the reforging of the four protagonists' friendship. In the year of the Circle of Magic quartet, Sandry, Tris, Daja and Briar live together and develop a strong friendship that manifests itself magically as a bond that allows them to communicate telepathically and causes their magical abilities to cross over from one to another. In The Circle Opens the four are separated, although their bond is clarified when they refer to each other as siblings or foster-siblings. Sandry remains in Summersea, living with her uncle in the Ducal Citadel, while Briar, Daja and Tris travel the world with their respective teachers. When they return, Daja after two years and Tris and Briar after four, the experiences they had while apart lead them to close their mental connection to each other, a representation of the distancing of their relationship. Sandry, feeling betrayed first by having been left behind, then by the telepathic wall, reciprocates in the same manner. Throughout the first few chapters of the book the four mages fight frequently. Briar and Tris are invited by Daja to live in her new house, with Tris taking over housekeeping duties to assuage what she perceives as charity from her wealthier friends. Daja withholds the extent of her hurt at not being able to return to Winding Circle as well as her experiences with the arsonist Ben Ladradun during Cold Fire. Tris lies about her newly learned ability to scry on the wind because of the ill treatment she experienced from other mages who found out. Briar refuses to discuss his experiences of war in GyongxeContinuity note on Briar, Rosethorn and Evvy's journey to Yanjing, official site, retrieved February 19, 2007. and his resulting post-traumatic stress disorder with anyone but Rosethorn, his teacher and traveling companion. Sandry and Daja are the first to reopen their mental connection, ending their estrangement. Later in the book, Briar and Tris open their connection with each other. Some time later, Sandry telepathically calls out to Tris and Briar when she's trapped in a box, nearly paralyzed by spells that bind her magic and her own fear of the dark. Eventually, their telepathic bond is completely restored, though they maintain their ability to screen their minds when they choose to. The bond, and the circle of thread that represents it, serve them in a joint magical working to breach the barrier on the Namorn- Anderran border during the book's climactic battle; once complete, Sandry finds the thread gone, and each of them is left with a scar on their right palm resembling the four lumps in the thread that had represented their magical identities. In the post-climactic scene, each of the four reveals the secret that they had been keeping, and Briar introduces his sisters to a mental recreation of Discipline Cottage, their former home, which he had created and used when he wanted to feel safe. Romantic sub-plot The Will of the Empress is the first book set in Emelan to involve the protagonists in a romantic sub-plot. While previous books alluded to romantic relationships between the adult characters, none of the four main characters were shown to have romantic interests. Sandry's visit to Namorn is punctuated by Empress Berenene's desire to see her marry a Namornese nobleman. She is courted by Jak and Fin, whose advances she rebuffs while maintaining a friendly acquaintance with them. She develops feeling for Shan and responds to his less public courtship, but when she learns that he's sexually involved with Empress Berenene, she doesn't pursue the relationship and rejects his offer of marriage. After Fin's incarceration Jak learns that Sandry is leaving Namorn and visits her before she leaves, when she tells him that she enjoys his company much more as a friend than as a suitor. Daja meets Rizu, the Empress's Mistress of Wardrobe, developing an infatuation with her and commenting on her beauty and flirtatiousness. Her feelings remain unacknowledged until Rizu makes the first move and kisses her, resulting in awkwardness on the part of Sandry, who telepathically senses the kiss and is flustered by the rush of Daja's emotions while dancing with Fin. Daja and Rizu's relationship quickly becomes sexual, and is discovered by Briar when he finds Rizu in Daja's bedroom one morning naked. During their short relationship, Daja develops intense feelings for Rizu and shows a desire for her to be accepted as part of her siblings' inner circle, while they are reluctant. When Daja prepares to leave Namorn she asks Rizu to return to Emelan with her and is heartbroken by her refusal; during the ride to the border she's shown to carry a small portrait of Rizu in her pouch. After Daja leaves, Berenene comments on Rizu's low spirits since her lover's departure. Briar, coping with an unspecified war in the country of Yanjing, tends to romance as many women as he can, mainly Caidy. He reassures the others that he takes droughtwort, a plant that renders the eater temporarily sterile. He has vivid nightmares of the war in Gyongxe when he sleeps alone.

Special education The district administration reported that 371 students or 14% were receiving special education services in 2009. The District engages in identification procedures to ensure that eligible students receive an appropriate educational program consisting of special education and related services, individualized to meet student needs. At no cost to the parents, these services are provided in compliance with state and federal law; and are reasonably calculated to yield meaningful educational benefit and student progress. To identify students who may be eligible for special education, various screening activities are conducted on an ongoing basis. These screening activities include: review of group-based data (cumulative records, enrollment records, health records, report cards, ability and achievement test scores); hearing, vision, motor, and speech/language screening; and review by the Instructional Support Team. When screening results suggest that the student may be eligible, the District seeks parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation. Parents who suspect their child is eligible may request a multidisciplinary evaluation from a professional employee of the School District or contact the Special Education Department head. In 2010, the state of Pennsylvania provided $1,026,815,000 for special education services. The funds were distributed to districts based on a state policy which estimates that 16% of the district's pupils are receiving special education services.

Districts are not allowed to raise taxes above that index unless they allow voters to vote by referendum, or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index for the 2011-2012 school year is 1.4 percent, but the Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of .75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year. In June 2011, the Pennsylvania General Assembly passed legislation eliminating six of the exceptions to the Act 1 Index. Several exceptions were maintained: 1) costs to pay interest and principal on indebtedness incurred prior to September 4, 2004 for Act 72 schools and prior to June 27, 2006 for non-Act 72 schools; 2) costs to pay interest and principal on electoral debt; 3) costs incurred in providing special education programs and services (beyond what is already paid by the State); and 4) costs due to increases of more than the Index in the school's share of payments to PSERS (PA school employees pension fund) taking into account the state mandated PSERS contribution rate. The legislature also froze the payroll amount public school districts use to calculate the pension-plan exception at the 2012 payroll levels. Further increases in payroll cannot be used to raise the district's exception for pension payments. A specific timeline for Act I Index decisions is published annually, by the Pennsylvania Department of Education.

The property tax relief was subtracted from the total annual school property tax bill for each property. Property owners apply for the relief through the county Treasurer's office. Farmers can qualify for a farmstead exemption on building used for agricultural purposes. The farm must be at least 10 contiguous acres and must be the primary residence of the owner. Farmers can qualify for both the homestead exemption and the farmstead exemption. Pennsylvania awarded the highest property tax relief to residents of the Chester-Upland School District in Delaware County at $641 per homestead and farmstead in 2010.Tax Relief per Homestead 5-1-10.

While called an experiment, SERVE included participation from 51 counties including up to 100,000 voters and ballots cast would have been counted toward actual election results.https://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/21/technology/23CND-INTE.html According to the SERVE security report, there were \\"two groups of eligible voters: (1) American citizens living outside the U.S., and (2) military personnel and their dependents, regardless of whether they reside in the U.S. or overseas.\\" The project was contracted by FVAP to Accenture, who in turn subcontracted Avenade, Hart InterCivic, Hewlett-Packard, VeriSign, election.com, and others. The project was cancelled in 2004 after a report critical of the program was published. Accenture, who acquired election.com in 2003, has received criticism for its role in SERVE and other failed and cancelled electronic voting and registration projects. Background There are millions of Americans living overseas in at least 100 countries. In the early 2000's, Americans living abroad needed to take several steps to be able to vote in their home districts, often having to correspond via mail numerous times in order to obtain identity information and permission to be able to get a mail-in-ballot. This also presented a problem, because some of the countries that are housing Americans do not have the most reliable mail systems. With legal-binding deadlines to register and cast ballots, this time-consuming process may hinder many individuals from voting. According to the Security Analysis report, the Secure Electronic Registration and Voting Experiment was established to minimize time spent voting by creating an online platform, which would allow Americans overseas greater access to vote. This began as a small project of 84 voters in 2000, but was expected to be implemented in 50 countries with seven corresponding US state elections by 2004. This would have included around 100,000 ballots, in an attempt to one day develop a system with the capacity to include all overseas Americans. Security report analysis In order to assess SERVE's security, professionals from various backgrounds conducted an analysis. They analyzed and documented many weaknesses in SERVE. The report first discussed the likelihood that cyber- attacks would succeed against SERVE, as well as to what extent an event such as a hacker breakthrough could compromise an election. The report states that \\"the software of SERVE is totally closed and proprietary\\", an inadequate inspection of SERVE before its launch allowed it \\"to be vulnerable to various forms of programmer attacks\\". This is critical information in the voting world. According to the report, a potential hack into SERVE \\"could result in large-scale, selective voter disenfranchisement, and/or privacy violation, and/or vote buying and selling, and/or vote switching even to the extent of reversing the outcome of many elections at once\\". This means that if SERVE is implemented, elections as important as the Presidential could be completely fraudulent without any trace of a culprit. Finally, it was the critics' place to suggest any potential solutions that could remedy SERVE's vulnerabilities. Their report states, \\"that the vulnerabilities described cannot be fixed by design changes or bug fixes to SERVE,\\" it explains that, \\"the vulnerabilities are fundamental in the architecture of the Internet and of the PC hardware and software that is ubiquitous today\\". It concludes that \\"there really is no good way to build such a voting system without a radical change in overall architecture of the Internet or some unforeseen security breakthrough\\".  Related experiments  As discussed by many experts, including a project manager at the Center for Public Integrity and a research fellow at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, security was the largest threat to the SERVE program. These security risks were put to the test in 2010 when J. Alex Halderman, a professor of Computer Science at the University of Michigan, took on a challenge issued by the District of Columbia to see if Halderman's students could hack their new Internet Voting system. Halderman's Computer Science students were quickly successful. The students not only managed to disable the system but also were able to add votes, change votes, and manipulate the program so that once voters cast their ballots, the University of Michigan fight song would play. These hacking results were immediately turned over to the DC system team in order to strengthen the security wall of the program. Within days, the DC experiment was terminated as the security risks were deemed too high and the threats of fraud and corruption were undeniable. Subsequent studies have reinforced the enormous difficulty of the requirements for secure online voting, and defined the research and development needed in creating end-to-end auditable voting systems.  MOVE Act  In order to give overseas voters more time and make it easier for them to vote, in 2009 the Military and Overseas Voter Empowerment Act (MOVE Act) was enacted.

He has worked in many forms, including large-scale operas, choral and orchestral works, and chamber music, both instrumental and vocal. His music is tonal, and is often rhythmically complex, with much use of polyrhythms. Biography John Metcalf was born in Swansea in 1946, and spent his childhood on the Gower Peninsula, at Reynoldston and Penmaen. When he was six, the family moved to Cardiff, where his father had taken a new job.'Interview' in Review Wales, 2013 January 16. He was educated at Dean Close School, Cheltenham. He intended to read classics at university, but he sent a composition to the composer, Alun Hoddinott, who encouraged him to instead study music at Cardiff University. In 1969 he founded the Vale of Glamorgan Festival, and remained its director until 1985. During this period he also composed his first opera, The Journey (1979). In 1986 he moved to Canada, to teach on the Music Theatre course at the Banff Centre in Alberta. He was afterwards appointed Artistic Director of the programme and Composer-in-residence. At Banff he composed his second opera, Tornrak, with a libretto by Michael Wilcox, which draws on Inuit musical traditions; and this and other operas were workshopped there. In 1991 he returned to Britain and settled at Llanfair Clydogau, near Lampeter, Ceredigion. There he built an energy-saving house from reclaimed materials. He resumed direction of the Vale of Glamorgan Festival, which he made a festival presenting the work of living composers only. Alongside his composing work, he was Artistic Director of the Banff Centre for ten years, and Director of the Swansea Festival until 2007. He is Artistic Director of the Vale of Glamorgan Festival, and also teaches at the annual MusicFest Aberystwyth. In 2012 he was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the New Year honours, for services to music. His seventh opera, Under Milk Wood: An Opera, with a text adapted from the play for voices by Dylan Thomas, was premiered at Taliesin Arts Centre, Swansea in April 2014. Discography Several of Metcalf's works are available on the album \\"In Time of Daffodils\\". This includes \\"Paradise Haunts\\", \\"Three Mobiles\\" and \\"In Time of Daffodils\\". These pieces are performed by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales. (Excerpts from \\"Paradise Haunts\\" were used as part of the Queensland Ballet Company production of A Midsummer Night's Dream.)

Opened in 1878, it is a Grade II* listed building, operated by Blackpool Entertainment Company Limitedhttps://www.endole.co.uk/company/09044792/blackpool-entertainment- company-limited on behalf of Blackpool Council, which purchased the property from Leisure Parcs Ltd as part of a ¬£40 million deal in 2010. The Winter Gardens has hosted the annual conferences of British political parties and trade unions and its owners claim that every Prime Minister since World War II has addressed an audience at the venue. It has also hosted the Blackpool Dance Festival since its inception in 1920, and the World Matchplay darts tournament since 1994. The annual dance competitions Miss Dance of Great Britain and Dance Master UK are hosted there annually. History The Winter Gardens Company bought the site in 1875 for ¬£28,000. The Winter Gardens was built on the six-acre Bank Hey Estate and officially opened on 11 July 1878. The original intention was \\"to place on the land a concert room, promenades, conservatories and other accessories calculated to convert the estate into a pleasant lounge, especially desirous during inclement days.\\" The Vestibule, Floral Hall, Ambulatory and Pavilion Theatre were all built in the 1870s and the Opera House Theatre originally opened in 1889. The Empress Ballroom was built in 1896 together with the Indian Lounge (now the Arena). The long-gone Blackpool Ferris wheel, erected in 1896, was also located at the complex. In 1910, the Opera House Theatre was rebuilt. Ownership of the complex changed in 1928 when the Winter Gardens Company was taken over by the Tower Company. In 1930, the Olympia was built and the following year saw the addition of the Galleon Bar, Spanish Hall and Baronial Hall. The Opera House Theatre was rebuilt in 1939. EMI took over the complex in 1967, and ownership changed hands again in 1983 when it was bought by First Leisure. In 1998, Leisure Parcs acquired the Winter Gardens from First Leisure's Resorts Division as part of an estimated ¬£74m deal which also included Blackpool Tower, and the resort's three piers. On 3 December 2009, it was revealed that Leisure Parcs had accepted an offer of ¬£40m from Blackpool Council to buy the Winter Gardens as well as the Tower, and other sites in the resort. The deal, financed through a combination of government regeneration cash, European funding and a loan, was finalised in March 2010. Political party conferences have increasingly taken place in major cities with modern, purpose-built conference centres such as Birmingham, Liverpool and Manchester, with the most recent major conference in Blackpool being the Conservative conference in 2007. Since 1996, the venue has hosted the yearly Rebellion Punk Festival. Location The Winter Gardens is in Blackpool's town centre, about 250 metres from the sea front. The complex occupies most of its block, a roughly square footprint with sides about 200 metres in length. The two north-facing corners of the block are not taken up by the Gardens buildings themselves, however, but by shops and restaurants. The northwest corner is completely separated by a road serving the stage door of the theatres. The west face also accommodates a few small shops with the same architectural styling as the main building. The complex is bounded by roads on all sides ‚Äì Church Street, Leopold Grove, Adelaide Street and Coronation Street. Component buildings The Opera House and Pavilion theatres, the Empress Ballroom, the Olympia exhibition hall and the Arena function hall are on the ground floor. All are contiguous and contained inside an Art Deco surface with a large arcade connecting two main entrances. There are additional function rooms on the first floor including the Spanish Hall, Baronial Hall and Renaissance Hall. Ground floorOpera House Theatre= Opera House Theatre The 3,000-seater Opera House is one of the largest theatres in the United Kingdom. The present theatre is the third one to have been built on the site. The original building, completed in 1889, at a cost of ¬£9,098 was designed by the theatre architect Frank Matcham, who also designed the nearby Grand Theatre and the Tower Ballroom. It had 2,500 seats, and was named Her Majesty's Opera House. The theatre's seating capacity was soon deemed insufficient and in November 1910 was closed for reconstruction. The new and larger building opened just nine months later. However, in 1938 the second Opera House was demolished and the present 3,000-seat theatre opened in 1939. The first Royal Variety Performance to be held outside London was staged at the Opera House in 1955. In 2009, the Royal Variety Performance was again staged at the theatre. It is home to the last new Wurlitzer organ to be installed in the UK. The Opera House Theatre hosts many theatrical performances in addition to variety shows and music concerts. Current capacity is 2,813. =Empress Ballroom= Empress Ballroom The Empress Ballroom was built in 1896. With a floor area of 12,500 square feet (1,160 sq. metres), the ballroom was one of the largest in the world. It was requisitioned by the Admiralty in 1918 for military use during World War I, before being handed back a year later. The ballroom hosted the first Blackpool Dance Festival in 1920. It was re-floored in 1934 In the late 1970s, some of the floor space was adapted for other purposes to reduce the venue's over- capacity. It was renamed The Stardust Garden and was intended to function as a nightclub. The ballroom has been used as a conference venue for many years by the Labour Party, Conservative Party and Liberal Democrats. The ballroom hosts the World Matchplay darts tournament, the Blackpool Dance Festival and the Inter Varsity Dance Competition. Acts such as Pet Shop Boys, The Beatles, Queen, Oasis, Radiohead, Slash and The White Stripes have performed in the ballroom. The White Stripes perform at The Empress Ballroom in their DVD and concert Under Blackpool Lights. It also housed a 3/14 Wurlitzer organ, much of the pipework coming from the original Blackpool Tower organ. It was played for many years by Horace Finch but was removed in 1969, eventually being broken up. A new Wurlitzer organ has more recently been installed in the Empress Ballroom by Cannock Chase Organ Club. The original console has survived and will hopefully be used in the future. =Pavilion Theatre= The Pavilion dates back to the original 1878 build, when it was built as a promenade pavilion. In 1885 a new proscenium and private boxes were added. It was then converted to a theatre in 1889. It was extensively altered in 1897 when the floor was lowered and tilted towards the stage. In the 1930s it was also used as a cinema showing talkies. After the cinema ceased operation, the Pavilion was used for Concerts & Shows until its refurbishment in the 1990s, when it was gutted leaving just the stage area intact, the back stage area is now a Restaurant and the seating area has been taken into the Horseshoe as an Exhibition space. The Pavilion theatre today has a capacity of 600. It is situated in the centre of the Horseshoe ‚Äì a semi-circular promenade providing a spacious self-contained exhibition area. =Arena= The Arena is adjacent to the Empress Ballroom. Built in 1896, it was originally known as the Indian Lounge because of its British Raj-inspired interior design created by J.M. Boekbinder. The lounge was remodelled as the Planet Room, a cabaret bar in 1964. It was again revamped in the 1980s in a Roman style and renamed the Arena. The Arena is now used as a venue in its own right for meetings, presentations and banquets or as an extension space for the Empress Ballroom. It has a capacity of between 220 and 600. =Olympia= Construction of the Olympia exhibition hall began in 1929 and it took eight months to build. It opened in June 1930, and the interior comprised stalls and attractions designed by film set designer Andrew Mazzei in the form of a Moorish village. The Olympia's exterior was finished in white faience and included a dome which was removed after World War II. During the war, the Olympia was used to teach morse code. The Olympia later found use as a funfair until the 1980s when it was adapted to a more modern indoor adventure playground called Professor Peabody's Playplace. The venue covers 2,600 square metres and is now used as a venue for exhibitions and trade shows, with a capacity of up to 3,500. First floor Spanish Hall Baronial Hall =Spanish Hall= The Spanish Hall is a large Andalucian style vaulted hall with battlemented balconies containing three-dimensional representations of clustered Spanish villages. It was also designed by Andrew Mazzei. A floor was constructed in the Winter Gardens' Victoria Street entrance to allow the creation of the hall. The Spanish Hall, which has undergone a ¬£1 million refurbishment is used for banquets and wedding receptions. It is self-contained with its own adjacent bar, the Windsor Bar and has a capacity of up to 1,000. =Baronial Hall= The Baronial Hall, added in 1931, is designed in the guise of a medieval castle. It is used for weddings and banquets with a capacity of up to 300. =Renaissance Hall= The Renaissance Hall was added in 1931 and is a period-style room. It has been used as a high-class restaurant and cocktail bar. It has a capacity of up to 275.

The film stars Hugh Sinclair as Simon Templar, also known as \\"The Saint\\", a world-roving crimefighter who walks the fine edge of the law. This was the seventh of eight films in RKO's film series about the character created by Leslie Charteris. It was Sinclair's first appearance as Templar, having taken over the role from George Sanders, who then stepped into RKO's \\"Falcon\\" series. The film is the seventh of nine features produced by RKO Pictures featuring suave detective Simon Templar and it marks a major change in the series, shifting production to England. The film was based upon Charteris' 1932 novel, Getaway (also known as The Saint's Getaway) and, like all the other films in the RKO Saint series, considerable liberties were taken with the original story. Most notably, the time frame of the story has been moved up to the Second World War, with the villains of the piece being Nazis. The film also disregards the fact that Getaway was in fact the third chapter of a trilogy which included the earlier works The Last Hero and Knight Templar. Unlike other films in the Saint series, Charteris himself co-wrote the screenplay. Also, unlike the previous Saint films, which were produced in Hollywood, The Saint's Vacation was produced and filmed in the United Kingdom. Plot summary Most of the story takes place in Switzerland, where Templar (Hugh Sinclair) interrupts his holiday to retrieve a missing secret code. The key to the mystery is a Swiss music box with a most unusual tune, diligently sought after by enemy agent Rudolph (Cecil Parker) and British secret service operative Valerie (Leueen MacGrath). Templar is aided in his investigation by reporter Mary Langdon (Sally Gray) and Monty Hayward (Arthur Macrae), with Inspector Teal (Gordon McLeod) of Scotland Yard. Cast * Hugh Sinclair as Simon Templar, aka The Saint * Sally Gray as Mary Langdon * Arthur Macrae as Monty Hayward * Cecil Parker as Rudolph Hauser * Leueen MacGrath as Valerie (as Leueen Macgrath) * John Warwick as Gregory * Manning Whiley as Marko * Felix Aylmer as Charles Leighton * Ivor Barnard as Emil * Gordon McLeod as Inspector Teal * Eric Clavering as Reporter (uncredited) * Roddy Hughes as Valet (uncredited) Notes In June 1939 it was announced John Farrow would direct the film. Several characters from Getaway do appear in the film adaptation, most notably Templar's friend Monty Hayward (the only time this recurring character from the early novels appeared on film). The villain of the film, Rudolf Hauser (played by Cecil Parker) is an adjustment of the book's villain, Prince Rudolf, who had also been the villain in the early Saint novels The Last Hero and Knight Templar. One notable omission from the character list is Templar's literary girlfriend, Patricia Holm, who is replaced by another character, Mary Langdon, played by Sally Gray. This was the first of two appearances by Sinclair as The Saint; he would later return in the film adaptation of Meet ‚Äì The Tiger!, also known as The Saint Meets the Tiger.

Louis was still a minor, and it was his mother Blanche of Castile who was responsible for the treaty. The agreement officially ended the Albigensian Crusade (began 1209) as Raymond conceded defeat to Louis IX. Based on the terms of the treaty, Raymond's daughter Joan was to be married to Louis' brother Alphonse. Since Joan was Raymond's heir, this meant she and Alfonso would become the rulers of Toulouse on his death. Moreover, Raymond ceded the eastern provinces of his lands to Louis and the Marquisat de Provence to the Pope. The treaty marked the end of Occitan political autonomy. Raymond ceded more than half his land to the French crown and retained the remainder only during his life, after which it would be inherited by his son-in-law Alphonse, Louis' brother, or, if Alphonse had no heir (as he did not), by the French crown. Raymond regained his feudal rights, but had to swear allegiance to Louis IX. Fortifications, such as those of Toulouse, were dismantled. The Cathars were left without political and military protection, as Raymond and his subordinates, now vassals of the French crown, were ordered to hunt them down.

The participants marched about 2,000 km to present their claims to President Juan Per√≥n. Origin of the name Mal√≥n is an Argentine Spanish word derived from Mapudungun malok, \\"invade\\". It refers to a surprise incursion, as often conducted by aboriginals when attacking creole settlements. The expression Mal√≥n de la Paz therefore means \\"Peace Incursion\\"; it is a kind of oxymoron. It was coined by one of the initial organizers of the march, the retired military engineer Mario Augusto Bertonasco. Background The lands originally inhabited by indigenous peoples in Argentina were almost completely occupied by the initial European settlers and by their descendants. In some regions the aboriginals were assimilated as cheap workforce for creole landowners; in others they were displaced and then exterminated (see Conquest of the Desert). Near the end of his term, President Hip√≥lito Yrigoyen planned to expropriate lands and grant them to their former aboriginal inhabitants, but a coup in 1930 ousted him and killed the project. On 31 August 1945, Kolla communities in the northwestern Argentine provinces of Jujuy and Salta, through a group of representatives, sent a note to the National Agrarian Council demanding the restitution of their lands, in compliance with previous laws. On 17 January 1946 President Edelmiro Juli√°n Farrell signed the expropriation decree. But as funds for the necessary land surveys and paperwork were in progress, the direction of the Council passed to other people, who blocked them. Beginning of the march The main organizer of the march was retired Lieutenant Engineer Mario Augusto Bertonasco, who had worked with the Mapuche in land claims and then moved to Jujuy and to Or√°n, Salta. It was he who coined the expression Mal√≥n de la Paz. The march started on 15 May 1946 in Abra Pampa, Jujuy, and arrived at the provincial capital San Salvador de Jujuy on 24 May, where the Pune√±os (on foot) were joined by another column coming from Or√°n and Iruya, Salta (on mules). They were 174 in total. Two days later the marchers departed for Salta and then passed by Tucum√°n on 9 June. They arrived at C√≥rdoba on 22 June, and marched on to Rosario. On 10 July the aboriginal leaders Valent√≠n Z√°rate and Jos√© Nievas, who had come ahead of the march while the rest were in Rosario, were received in Buenos Aires by president of the Chamber of Deputies at the National Congress. The march went on, passing by San Nicol√°s de los Arroyos on 18 July and by Pergamino, Buenos Aires on 21 July, where a Neighbors Commission greeted the marchers with offers of food and clothing. They were received by 60,000 people, including municipal authorities and farmers (who were additionally claiming for an agrarian reform). The Mal√≥n reached Luj√°n on 30 July, and Merlo on 1 August, where it was met and received support by hundreds of residents. Entrance in Buenos Aires The march entered Buenos Aires through Liniers on 3 August 1946. They were received by the head of the Aboriginal Protection department, and given accommodation (whether significantly or not) at the Immigrants' Hotel. The marchers, joined by local residents, went up to Congress, where they were homaged, and then to Plaza de Mayo. Former President Farrell, President Per√≥n and other authorities greeted them from the balcony of the Casa Rosada. Nationalist groups opposed to the aboriginals caused minor incidents, but were repelled by the people. Per√≥n then paid a personal visit to the marchers. Forced return After this reception, however, the government showed its true colours. On 27 August, forces of the Naval Prefecture were sent to force the marchers to get on a train. On encountering resistance, the Federal Police was called, and around midnight the Immigrants' Hotel was attacked with tear gas. Lieutenant Bertonasco refused to give the order of abandoning the hotel, and left. Once in the train, the marchers broke the windows and some of their leaders jumped off. The Kolla deputy for Jujuy, Dionisio Viviano, met with them and Bertonasco to intercede for the marchers, but were not heard. The train passed by Rosario and C√≥rdoba en route back to the northwest, with the stations surrounded by police forces to keep the passengers from coming out. On 3 September the train reached San Salvador de Jujuy. On 30 November, President Per√≥n declared that the Mal√≥n de la Paz \\"did not represent... the authentic indigenous inhabitants of our north\\", and claimed that they had come by train and motor vehicles rather than on foot. Moreover, he said, some were not even from the north of Argentina, but had been born in the north of the province of Buenos Aires and were unwilling to return. Legacy Despite the reaction to the Mal√≥n, in 1949 the national government expropriated some lands in the Puna and the Quebrada de Humahuaca, for them to be returned to their original inhabitants, but this was never done. On 7 August 2006, sixty years after the first Mal√≥n, a march with similar goals (the Second Mal√≥n de la Paz) was organized in Jujuy, to demand that the provincial government comply with a judicial order to grant the indigenous communities about 15,000 km¬≤ of land.

It is the fourth and final book in the Circle of Magic quartet, starring the four young mages Sandry, Tris, Daja and Briar as they learn to handle powerful magic, form intense bonds of friendship and stand up against destructive forces of nature. Plot introduction The main protagonist of the book is Briar Moss, a young ex-thief and \\"green\\" or plant mage, having ambient magic with all forms of plant life. Through his eyes the book explores themes of poverty and social injustice, as a deadly plague named the Blue Pox strikes The Mire, the poorest quarter of Emelan's capital city, Summersea. Plot summary To Briar, the Mire is familiar territory, having been first a street-rat and then a thief in Deadman's District, the poorest quarter of his native Hajra, before his magic was discovered by the great mage Niklaren Goldeye and he was taken to Winding Circle, a temple school for ambient mages. One day while out running errands with his teacher, Rosethorn, Briar is summoned to the Mire to examine Flick, a poor friend affected by a strange illness. Puzzled by what he has encountered, Briar enlists Rosethorn's help. The two bring the feverish girl to Urda's House, (a small charity hospital), where they learn that Flick is by far not the only one affected; many other people from the poorest parts of Summersea are ill as well. They also learn, to Briar's dismay, that the hospital has been put under quarantine to help stop the \\"blue pox\\"‚Äîso named for the bluish sores that mark the skin‚Äîfrom spreading even further. Trapped in Urda's House due to the quarantine, Rosethorn and Briar are kept busy with caring for the patients. Together with the healers, they come to the conclusion that it isn't the blue spots that are necessarily dangerous, but the fever. Even more troubling is the fever's apparent resistance to willowbark tea, a usually successful remedy. These revelations don't make the task of caring for patients any easier, however, and over the next few days many of them‚Äîincluding Flick‚Äîpass away. Eventually it's realized that the quarantine on Urda's House is useless; the plague has already spread to the whole of Summersea. Briar and Rosethorn are given leave, and travel back to Winding Circle, where Sandry, Tris and Daja spend the night with Briar in the altar room to help him cope with Flick's death. Rosethorn works with Dedicate Crane and a team of Air mages to find a cure for the sickness. But it is Briar's sharp-eyed friend Tris who discovers the first real breakthrough; the origin of the disease. With Niko's help, she learns that the disease was a result of a magical experiment gone wrong and disposed of incorrectly. Unfortunately, just as things start to look bright in the search for a cure for the blue pox, an accident in Crane's lab causes Rosethorn to become sick with it as well. This causes Briar to work twice as hard, determined not to lose Rosethorn as he had lost Flick, and slowly a cure begins to develop. (Rosethorn continues to send notes to Crane through Briar.) After several days, the cure is deemed to be safe and Crane tests it on Rosethorn. She starts to recover, but has a bad cough, which develops into pneumonia. Lark goes to find a healer, but while she is gone, Rosethorn has a seizure. Briar, not wanting to lose his teacher, plunges after her into death, magically linking himself to the three girls and his beloved shakkan, or miniature tree. Suspended in a sort of limbo, he finds Rosethorn in a garden, and they argue fiercely. Only after he threatens to sever the magical cords linking him to life does she agree to return with him. Upon their return, they discover that Rosethorn has temporarily lost her ability to speak, due to the seizure and the accompanying block of oxygen flow to her brain. But that appears to be the only lasting damage, and the blue pox has vanished for good. A month later, Briar and the girls are on the roof. Sandry comments that it is the four's birthday, they have all been at Discipline Cottage for a year. Everyone has to leave for various reasons, leaving Briar alone. He contemplates birthdays, and decides his birthday will be the following day, the day Rosethorn invited him to her garden. She calls up to him and tells him to come down and start weeding.

Under bright illumination (e.g. when exposed to daylight) the display acts mainly as a reflective display with the contrast being constant with illuminance. However, under dim and dark ambient situations the light from a backlight is transmitted through the transflective layer to provide light for the display. The transflective layer is called a transflector. It is typically made from a sheet polymer. It is similar to a one-way mirror but is not specular. An application is digital LCD wristwatches. In dim ambient light or at night a backlight allows reading of the display in its transmissive mode.: W. Boller, M. Donati, J. Fingerle, P. Wild, Illuminating Arrangement for a Field-Effect Liquid-Crystal Display as well as Fabrication and Application of the Illuminating Arrangement, filed Oct. 15, 1976. Digital time displays in alarm clocks for bedrooms may also work this way. If they are battery-powered, the backlight is push-botton operated. The backlighting is dim, so that the display is comfortably readable at night. Some 21st century smartwatches such as the Pebble Smartwatch and the Amazfit Stratos also use transflective LCDs. When an illuminance sensor is added for control of the backlight, such a transflective LCD can be read over a wide range of illuminance levels. This technique is often found in automotive instrumentation. In portable electronic devices the transflective mode of operation helps to save battery charge, since in bright environments no backlighting is required. Some displays that transmit light and have minor reflectivity are best readable in the dark and fairly readable in bright sunlight, but only under a particular angle; they are least readable in bright daylight without direct sunlight.

Rockdelux's brief was to serve a specific section of the public who are passionate about music, and its focus was on new and more alternative artists from both Spain and the outside world (termed \\"international\\"). It had an extensive review section, covering mainly new musical releases and re- releases, but also covered other music-related subjects such as live concerts and videos and featured reviews of new books and graphic novels. Unlike many other review sections in popular magazines, it eschewed the trend of giving a numerical value to each review, which are purely composed of written text summing up the release's values. From 1987 Santi Carrillo was the editor-in- chief of the magazine. Rockdelux was the recipient of various awards for music publication of the year from such organisations as Radio 3, Cadena SER and Iberpop amongst others.

The 24-minute film documents the nightly postal train operated by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) from London to Glasgow and the staff who operate it. Narrated by John Grierson and Stuart Legg, the film ends with a \\"verse commentary\\"\\"Verse commentary by W. H. Auden\\" is the standard phrase used by distributors of the film and by film historians; e.g. written by W. H. Auden to score by composer Benjamin Britten. The locomotive featured in the film is Royal Scot Class No. 6115 Scots Guardsman. Night Mail premiered on 4 February 1936 at the Cambridge Arts Theatre in Cambridge, England in a launch programme for the venue. Its general release gained critical praise and became a classic of its own kind, much imitated by adverts and modern film shorts. Night Mail is widely considered a masterpiece of the British Documentary Film Movement. A sequel was released in 1987 entitled Night Mail 2. Synopsis Train at speed The film follows the distribution of mail by train in the 1930s, focusing on the so-called Postal Special train, a train dedicated only to carrying the post and with no members of the public. The night train travels on the mainline route from Euston station in London to Glasgow, Scotland, on to Edinburgh and then Aberdeen. External shots include the train itself passing at speed down the tracks, aerial views of the countryside, and interior shots of the sorting van (actually shot in studio). Much of the film highlights the role of postal workers in the delivery of the mail. Development=Background In 1933, Stephen Tallents left his position as a secretary and director of the Empire Marketing Board (EMB), a government advertising agency that decided to cease operations, and began work as the first Controller of Public Relations for the General Post Office (GPO). In the wake of the EMB's demise, Tallents secured the transfer of the EMB Film Unit to the control of the GPO, with EMB employee John Grierson transitioning from head of the EMB Film Unit to head of the newly formed GPO Film Unit, bringing most of its film staff with him. By 1936 the GPO was the nation's largest employer with 250,000 staff and Tallents had begun to improve its public image, making the GPO spending more money on publicity than any other government entity at the time with a significant portion allocated to its film department. Despite early GPO films primarily educating and promoting the public about its services, as with The Coming of the Dial (1933), they were also largely intended to ward off privatisation and promote a positive impression of the post office and its employees. Night Mail originated from the desire to produce a film that would serve as the public face of a modern, trustworthy postal system, in addition to boosting the low morale of postal workers at the time. The postal sector had seen an increase in profits in the late 1920s, but by 1936 wages had fallen 3% for the mostly working class GPO employees. The Trade Disputes and Trade Unions Act 1927 had seriously curtailed postal union power, and the Great Depression fostered a general mood of pessimism. The liberal-minded Watt, Wright, Grierson, and other GPO film unit members, therefore, wanted Night Mail to focus not only on the efficiency of the postal system but its reliance on its honest and industrious employees. Pre-production In 1935, directors Harry Watt and Basil Wright were called into Grierson's office who informed them of the GPO's decision to make a documentary film about the postal train that travels overnight from London Euston to Glasgow, operated by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS). Watt had no knowledge of the service, and claimed the idea was originally instigated by Wright. Wright prepared a rough shooting outline and script by travelling on the railway and used conversations picked up by a stenographer to write the dialogue, all of which was used in the film. Watt then used the rough version to write a full script as the outline had lacked enough detail, \\"but there was a shape\\". He contacted the LMS and was amazed to find the railway had its own film director who offered assistance. Watt described the research process as \\"reasonably straightforward\\", which included multiple trips along the railway, and soon completed a full treatment. Wright later said that Watt changed his dialogue towards \\"a more human and down-to-earth\\" style which he praised him for doing. Early into development, however, Wright had to dedicate more time to other projects and left Watt in charge as director, yet both are credited as the film's two writers, directors, and producers. Initially, Grierson sent his team to observe the postal train staff at work with the aim of producing an information film on the train's operations, but little of the information reported back was used. Its synopsis then developed into a more ambitious one, taking \\"considerable licence with the truth to portray a picture of the 'reality' of working life\\". The script developed, a film crew was assembled that included Wright, Watt, and cameramen Pat Jackson, Jonah Jones, and Henry \\"Chick\\" Fowle. Brazilian-born Alberto Cavalcanti became involved as sound director who mixed the sound, dialogue, and music. Soon after, Grierson hired poet W. H. Auden for six months to gain film experience at the GPO and assigned him as Watt's assistant director with \\"starvation wages\\" of ¬£3 a week, less than what Auden had earned as a school teacher. Auden made ends meet by living with Wright before moving in with fellow GPO employee, painter and teacher William Coldstream. Watt cared little for Auden's fame and well known work, calling him \\"a half-witted Swedish deckhand\\" and complained of his frequent lateness during filming. Watt later wrote: \\"[Auden] was to prove how wrong my estimation of him was, and leave me with a lifetime's awe of his talent\\". The GPO secured a ¬£2,000 budget for the film's production, and calculated staff travel allowances by the accounts department totalling the salaries of the crew involved and setting aside money based on the figure. Production=Filming Signalman switching points as shown near the beginning of the film Production lasted for four months. Due to technological constraints, the majority of Night Mail was shot as a silent film with the sound, dialogue, and music added in post-production. Jackson recalled there was not \\"a great deal\\" of synchronised sound filming while on location, barring some \\"fragments\\". The on screen individuals were real life postal employees, but their dialogue was originally written by Watt and Wright who gained inspiration from the conversations they overheard while observing them at work. The film was shot on standard 35 mm film using long magazines with each canister allowing for around two minutes of footage. Footage captured on location were taken on portable Newman-Sinclair cameras, which were often too heavy for the cameraman to hold. For this reason, Watt estimated 90% of the film was shot on a tripod. The background sound was recorded in various locations, with the crew using the studio's sound van. This included recording at Bletchley station, where the crew recorded passing trains and instructed drivers to pass the station at speed while blowing the whistle so they could get a sound that gradually fades. Shots of the train travelling at sunset were also taken at Bletchley, including a day where the team had spent the entire day at the studio before \\"we'd pile into a clapped- out car\\" and drive there to get the one shot. The platelayers were filmed several miles north of Hemel Hempstead as the film crew walked along the track to obtain shots of any railway action, including passing trains and the movement of signals and points. They were joined by a \\"ganger\\", an employee of the LMS who alerted the team of oncoming trains and guided them to the sidewalk. Jackson recalled the yelling of \\"Up fast, stand clear\\" or \\"Down fast, stand clear\\" from the ganger at \\"infuriating regularity\\". The crew came into contact with the platelayers, catching them at work and stopping for an oncoming train which included them sharing cigarettes and beer. Jackson noted down the various comments spoken amongst them for the voice recording during post-production and recalled the team's satisfaction upon viewing the footage the following morning. Watt instructed Jackson to produce a rough assembly of the shot, his first experience at cutting film. However, problems arose due to errors in cutting which necessitated the crew's return to the location to reshoot the sequence. Jackson wrote: \\"We were lucky to find the same gang two miles further down the line\\". The film \\"starred\\" Royal Scot Class No. 6115 Scots Guardsman. Filming at Crewe station for the train's 13-minute stop took several days, and involved the team setting up their own scaffolding and arc lamps and electrician Frank Brice running power cables onto the track to supply power from their generator. Once finished, the equipment was packed in time for arrival of the postal train bound for London. Jackson boarded this train with the film reels for processing at Humphries Laboratories, sleeping on mail bags and arriving at the lab during the night. With the processed film ready in the morning, Jackson would take a postal train back to Crewe where the team could view the footage at a local cinema before it opened at 2:00 pm. Having viewed the footage, they would return to the station and set up the equipment to capture the next 13-minute stop. Their time at Crewe was memorable for Auden, who claimed that when a shot of a guard was complete, \\"he dropped dead about thirty seconds later\\". Postal staff at work in a sorting carriage Wright was responsible for the aerial shots of the train from a hired aircraft, while Watt filmed the interior and location shots. The men in the sorting coach were real Post Office workers, but filmed in a reconstructed set built at the GPO's studio in Blackheath. They were instructed to sway from side to side to recreate the motion of the moving train which was accomplished by following the movement of a suspended piece of string. Early attempts to simulate motion was done by shaking the set, but Watt wrote: \\"It just rattled like a sideboard in a junction town\\". Attempts to film while shaking the camera also failed as it merely produced a wobbly shot. Among Auden's first tasks as assistant director was taking charge of the second camera unit as they shot mail bags being transported at London's Broad Street station, where a replica postal train was assembled for a night so the crew could film and record sound to match the footage they had captured at Crewe. Wright later thought it was \\"one of the most beautifully organised shots\\" of the entire film. The filming session began at 5:00 pm and lasted for 14 hours without a break. It included filming of the wheeltapper, who became the subject of an inside joke at the film studio when the crew forgot to shoot his scenes until the next morning. They adopted the term when the unit had missed a shot. Shots taken at Broad Street were incorporated into the Crewe sequence in the film. Fowle is credited with capturing several dramatic shots, including the mail bag being dropped off into a trackside net at high speed. To do this, he leaned out of the coach where the metal arm reached outward while his two colleagues held onto his legs, and got the shot just before the arm quickly swung back upon contact. Lighting was limited for this sequence as the crew could only work with small battery-powered lights. Fowle also solved the problem of recording the sound of the train as it travelled along the track and points, which produced unsatisfactory results when a microphone was placed on a real train. The crew had even placed their sound van onto a bogie coupled behind a train and travelled up and down a stretch of line for an entire day, but the overall sound drowned it out. Jackson, whose brother was a model railway enthusiast, then suggested recording using a model train, and a class- six engine and track was obtained from model manufacturer Basset-Lowke with that were set up in the film studio. Jackson proceeded to push the engine back and forth along the track at the same speed as the train in the picture which produced the sound they needed. Watt realised the importance of getting the sound right: \\"Without that sound, the centre of a film that was to make my career would have completely failed\\". Shots of Night Mail include trains travelling up and down Beattock Summit in Scotland. During the construction of the sorting coach set, Watt, Jones, and Jackson were assigned an engine to themselves and travelled up and down Beattock Summit in Scotland several times. This included another dangerous shot captured by Jackson, after attempts to take footage of the driver's cab produced film that was too dark. To solve this, Jackson sat atop of the coal pile in the locomotive's tender while holding a reflective sheet made with silver paper that acted as a mirror to make subjects brighter. As he filmed, the train passed a bridge which knocked the reflector off and narrowly missed his head. The cameramen continued into Scotland to film the closing shots at dawn, and Watt captured the partridges, rabbits, and dogs at a Dumfries farm. During their stay in Glasgow, Grierson informed Watt that upon completing the interior scenes and recording the sound, the film's budget had been spent and suggested that filming cease. Watt still had more footage to capture, however, wishing for a coda that showed an engine being cleaned and serviced at the end of the journey before starting its next one. The situation was solved when the three stayed with Watt's mother in Edinburgh and travelled to Glasgow in the guard's van to get the final shots. Poem sequence After viewing a rough assembly of the film, Grierson, Wright, and Cavalcanti agreed that a new ending was needed. Wright recalled that it was most likely Grierson who noted that up to this point, the film had documented the \\"machinery\\" of delivering letters, but \\"What about the people who write them and the people who get them?\\" A sequence with a spoken poem set to music would was deemed more suitable, and Auden was given the task of writing the verse. Watt expressed his disagreement with the idea at first, but came round to it when it presented the opportunity in shooting additional footage and using previously shot film that was could not be used to complete the sequence. The sequence includes \\"at least two shots\\" that Wright had filmed for a test shoot for a film that was never made. Auden and Watt went through many drafts of the verse to exactly match the rhythm of the travelling train. Night Mail train approaching the Scottish border Auden's poem for the sequence, entitled \\"Night Mail\\", was written at the film unit's main office in Soho Square. Watt described his work area as \\"A bare table at the end of a dark, smelly, noisy corridor\\", a contrast to the more peaceful surroundings that he was used to working in. He paced it to match the rhythm of the train's wheels \\"with a stopwatch in order to fit it exactly to the shot\\". Grierson biographer Forsyth Hardy wrote that Auden wrote the verse on a trial and error basis, and was cut to fit the visuals by editor Richard McNaughton in collaboration with Cavalcanti and Wright. Many lines from the original version were discarded and became \\"crumpled fragments in the wastepaper basket\\", including one that described the Cheviot Hills by the English‚ÄìScottish border as \\"uplands heaped like slaughtered horses\\" that Wright considered too strong for the landscape that was shot for it. The sequence begins slowly before picking up speed, so that by the last-but-one verse, assistant and narrator Stuart Legg speaks at a breathless pace, which involved several pauses in recording so he could catch his breath. Before recording his parts, Legg took a deep breath and recited the poem until he could no longer breathe, and ended with a \\"Huh\\" sound of taking a breath. The \\"Huh\\" sound was located and marked down on the audio tape to show where he was to continue. As the train slows toward its destination, the final verse, which is more sedate, is read by Grierson. Hardy added that what was retained made Night Mail \\"as much a film about loneliness and companionship as about the collection and delivery of letters\\", which made the film \\"a work of art\\". Around the time of Auden's arrival at the GPO, Cavalcanti suggested to Grierson that he hire 22-year-old English composer Benjamin Britten to contribute music to the film department, including the musical score for Night Mail. Grierson accepted, assigning Britten a weekly salary of ¬£5. Watt urged Britten to avoid \\"any bloody highbrow stuff\\", and showed him the picture while playing an American jazz record and requested \\"this kind of music\\". Britten had little interest in jazz music, but was given artistic freedom to compose. He was allowed an orchestra of ten musicians, and used a compressed air cylinder and sandpaper to create a \\"sound picture\\" of the pistons and pumps of a steam locomotive at speed. The music was recorded at the Blackheath studio, Jackson claimed Britten had only used five musicians, all of whom were hand picked. In order to keep the orchestra in time, Britten conducted to an \\"improvised visual metronome\\" that involved marks cut at particular intervals in the film that appeared as flashes on the screen. By 12 January 1936, the music had been written which was followed by the recording sessions that began on 15 January. Narration After the poem sequence was finalised, the remaining sound recording which included the narrative commentary. Wright thought Jackson's voice was suitable for the part and suggested it to him. Jackson agreed, but disliked the sound of his voice upon playback: \\"My dulcet tones are immortalised in a few simple statements [...] I sounded like some Oxford pimp on the prowl, and never having been to Oxford, I should know\\". Release The Cambridge Arts Theatre, where Night Mail premiered The film premiered on 4 February 1936 at the Cambridge Arts Theatre in Cambridge as one of the films presented at the launch screening at the venue. A screening was held the following morning. Jackson, Watt, and Wright were among the GPO staff present; the former recalled the audience's enthusiastic response to the film which included an \\"enormous applause\\" at the end. The film was the GPO's only production to be released commercially in 1936. Wright was angered upon its general release as he found out that he was jointly credit as producer and director with Watt, when he believed he had done most of the work. Night Mail was promoted with a largely successful advertising campaign to aid its release. The GPO commissioned posters, special screenings, and other soft publicity opportunities, taking advantage of the glamorous image and popularity of railway films to promote Night Mail. Unlike other GPO films, which were primarily screened in schools, professional societies, and other small venues, Night Mail was shown in commercial cinemas as an opening for the main feature. However, poor contracts for short documentary films meant Night Mail failed to make a significant profit despite its high viewership. In 2007, Night Mail was released on DVD by the British Film Institute following a digital restoration of the original film. The set includes 96 minutes of bonus features, including the 1986 sequel Night Mail 2. Reception Writing for The Spectator in 1936, Graham Greene gave the film mild praise, describing the \\"simple visual verses of Mr Auden [as] extraordinarily exciting\\", while admitting that the film as a whole \\"isn't a complete success\\". Greene dismissed the criticism of including Auden's verse from C. A. Lejeune's review in The Observer, however he found fault with some of the quality and clarity of some of the scenes. (reprinted in: ) Analysis According to documentary author Betsy McLane, Night Mail makes three primary arguments: First, the postal system is complex and must function under the auspices of a national government in order to thrive. Second, the postal system is a model of modern efficiency, and third, postal employees are industrious, jovial, and professional. Grierson also articulated a desire to reflect \\"Scottish expression\\" and unity between England and Scotland with Night Mail. More broadly, British Film Institute historian Ian Aitken describes Grierson's position on the function of documentary film as \\"representing the inter- dependence and evolution of social relations in a dramatic and symbolic way\\". He cites Night Mail‚Äôs portrayal of the postal system's practical and symbolic importance through both humanistic realism and metaphorical imagery as characteristic of Grierson's ideals. Author A. R. Fulton points out effective film editing to build suspense on everyday operations, such as the mail bags being caught by the track side nets. The scene is \\"humanized\\" with the new starter learning the task and lasts no longer than 90 seconds, yet it comprises 58 shots, averaging under two shots per second. Fulton compared its construction to that of Battleship Potemkin (1925) by Sergei Eisenstein. Fulton believes the main theme of Night Mail is suggested by one of Auden's lines in the poem: \\"All Scotland waits for her\\". The film utilises three contrasting techniques to convey its meaning. First, Night Mail portrays the daily activities of the postal staff on a human scale, with colloquial speech and naturalistic vignettes, like sipping beer and sharing inside jokes. This was the approach favoured by Watt, who apprenticed under ethnographic filmmaker Robert Flaherty. Second, Night Mail uses expressionistic techniques like heavy back lighting and the lyric poetry of Auden to convey the grand scale of the postal endeavour. These techniques were championed by Wright, a lover of experimental European cinema. Finally, the film occasionally employs narration to explain the particular marvels of the mail system. This factual exposition was promoted by Grierson. Night Mail, though edited in a naturalistic style, nevertheless utilises potent lyric symbolism. The film contrasts the national importance of the postal system, embodied by a train journey which literally enables cross-country communication, with the local accents and colloquial behaviour of its staff, demonstrating that a great nation is composed of its humble and essential regions and peoples. Night Mail further reinforces the strength of national unity by juxtaposing images of cities and countryside, factories and farms. The technologically advanced rail system, nestled comfortably in the immutable landscape, demonstrates that modernity can be British. The main body of the film uses minimal narration, usually in the present tense and always underscored with diegetic sound. This ancillary commentary serves to elaborate on the onscreen action (‚ÄúThe pouches are fixed to the standard by a spring clip‚Äù) or invigorate and expand the world of the film (‚ÄúFour million miles every year. Five hundred million letters every year.‚Äù) The bulk of the story is conveyed through dialogue and imagery, however, leaving the narrative thrust in the hands of the postal workers. Night Mail‚Äôs significance is due to a combination of its aesthetic, commercial, and nostalgic success. In contrast to previous GPO releases, Night Mail garnered critical notice and commercial distribution through Associated British Film Distributors (ABFD). Night Mail was also one of the first GPO films built on a narrative structure, a critically influential technique in the development of documentary filmmaking. More broadly, the personnel of the GPO and Night Mail contributed to the development of documentary film worldwide. Grierson, in particular, pioneered not only a highly influential theory of \\"actuality\\" film, but developed structures of funding, production, and distribution which persist to this day. He advocated state support for documentary film as well as arguing the civic merits of educational film. Night Mail, one of the first commercial successes of the GPO, served as a \\"proof of concept\\" that his methods and goals could be publicly successful. The film's blend of social purpose and aesthetic form position it as an archetypal film of the British Documentary Film Movement. For these reasons, the film is a staple of film education worldwide. English television producer and author Denys Blakeway praised Auden's contributions and the coda sequence which \\"rescued the documentary from plodding Post Office propaganda and helped to establish the emerging form as a new branch of the arts\\". Legacy and adaptations  Despite its many critical successes, its limited budget, and unfavourable terms for short documentary films under the 1927 Cinematograph Films Act, which required British cinemas present a minimum quota of British feature films, ultimately doomed the GPO Film Unit. The unit's films could not compete with commercial fare and the Treasury's sceptical assessment of its value. The unit disbanded in 1940 and reformed as the Crown Film Unit under the Ministry of Information. Grierson and many other prominent members of the GPO Film Unit continued their work in documentary film in the United Kingdom and abroad. Grierson has subsequently been called \\"the person most responsible for the documentary film as English speakers have known it\\". Night Mail itself is sometimes considered the apotheosis of the collaborative work of the GPO Film Unit, a beloved, and nearly unique ode to the Royal Mail, the British people, and the creative possibilities of \\"actuality\\" films. The film was widely admired by contemporary critics as well as current scholars, and remains popular with the British public. School children often memorise \\"Night Mail\\", and the film has been parodied in advertisements and sketch shows. 1986 sequel poem In 1986, fifty years after the release of the original film, English poet Blake Morrison was hired to write a poem for a sequel, Night Mail 2, which tells the story of the contemporary mail delivery system. Morrison incorporated the line \\"uplands heaped like slaughtered horses\\" into his poem which was originally cut from Auden's version. He concluded: \\"For that alone, I was pleased to be part of the remake\\". 1988 British Rail advert In 1988, British Rail produced the \\"Britain's Railway\\" television advert which showed the business sectors introduced in 1986. This used the first stanza of Auden's poem, followed by some new lines: John Chenery http://www.lightstraw.co.uk/gpo/film/nightmail1.html > Passing the shunter intent on its toil, moving the coke and the coal and the > oil. Girders for bridges, plastic for fridges. Bricks for the site are > required by tonight. Grimy and grey is the engine's reflection, down to the > docks for the metal collection. > Passenger trains full of commuters, bound for the office to work in > computers. The teacher, the doctor, the actor in farce; the typist, the > banker, the judge in first class. Reading the Times with the crossword to > do, returning at night on the six forty-two.

Although he is the monarch de jure of his kingdom, called Rhinoland, his more intelligent wife, Lady Rataxes, is the de facto ruler. He is often surrounded by his rhinoceros guards. These guards also keep watch for cars, to collect tolls on the roads that pass through the kingdom. It is said that King Rataxes got his name from these tolls, so it is questionable if \\"Rataxes\\" is his real name or a sobriquet. Rataxes and his general, Pamir are seen wearing Morions and gorgets in The Travels of Babar. King Rataxes also has a son, Victor (who is, in fact, close friends with Babar's children), and is attended by a servant, Basil, who is also his adviser (and is often seen as being wiser and much more competent than Rataxes, and thus often is one that gets things done in the kingdom). Basil and the other rhinos show much loyalty to Rataxes, though they will sometimes run away and leave him to face a situation alone if they feel threatened or overwhelmed. Under the rule of King Rataxes, Celesteville and Rhinoland have occasionally gone to war with each other, though peace is restored before much damage or casualties are suffered. The rhino army is under the command of Rataxes (and the elephant army under the command of King Babar). The two countries have also been known to work together against common threats, such as when the area is infiltrated by poachers, and the two will help each other during times of need or crisis. In the television series, after working together to defend the region against a group of poachers (including the one who shot Babar's mother), the two countries, along with other nearby animal-controlled territories, form a \\"united jungle coalition\\", a concept similar to the United Nations, which prevents the outbreak of major conflicts between the animal countries thereafter. The militaries of the countries are considered simple and rely mostly on simple hand weaponry, such as spears and staffs. Guns are strictly forbidden by all the animals, due to their disgust with the poachers who would use the weapons. Not even Rataxes dares to think of arming his country with such things, after seeing their effects first-hand. Rhinoland is made up of primarily jungle territory, and borders neighboring Celesteville (presumably somewhere in Africa). The capital city of Rhinoland consists mainly of large stone pyramid structures, which house most government offices, as well as the Rataxes living quarters, and quarters for the army, along with a series of storage facilities and dungeons. Much of the rhino population live in houses and structures nearby. Though perhaps not as technologically or culturally \\"refined\\" as their elephant counterparts, the rhinos are all fairly educated, and both Lord and Lady Rataxes do care about the safety and well-being of their citizens, and will go to great lengths to help them, even if it sometimes means asking their elephant counterparts for assistance. Rataxes portrayal has differed slightly between the animated TV series, where he was seen as more cold and rude and power-hungry to the idea of a king himself than Babar; as himself and Babar aren't good friends, because a long time ago Babar dislikes him due to his meanness and his rude behavior; and in Babar: The Movie where he was seen as slightly more ruthless and corrupt and had the attributes of a warlord.

It is the source of the river Sukhona, which flows out in the southeastern corner of the lake. Administratively, the lake is divided between Vologodsky District (west), Sokolsky District (southeast), and Ust-Kubinsky District (east) of Vologda Oblast. In terms of the area, Lake Kubenskoye is the fourth natural lake of Vologda Oblast (behind Lake Onega, Lake Beloye, and Lake Vozhe) and the fifth lake (also behind the Rybinsk Reservoir). The area of the basin of the lake is . The basin occupies much of the central and northern parts of Vologda Oblast, as well as parts of Konoshsky District of Arkhangelsk Oblast. The major tributary of the lake is the Kubena.  History  The lake was settled by Russians in the 12th century, when the Kamenny Monastery was founded on an islet in the lake. One branch of the Princes of Yaroslavl owned lands in the vicinity and was known as Princes Kubensky. Since 1828, the lake has been part of the Volga-Northern Dvina canal system. The eastern terminus of the Northern Dvina Canal is at the northwestern end of the lake. In 1917, a dam was built at the outflow of the Sukhona, thus converting the lake into a reservoir.

It was written by Vortex co-founder Costa Panayi who also coded the similarly styled Tornado Low Level. Gameplay The player controls a rescue helicopter and must retrieve five supply crates containing essential medical supplies from a collection of 14 islands, while a dangerous cyclone is in the area. In-game screenshot showing play area and HUD. While searching for the missing crates, the player may optionally earn bonus points by rescuing refugees from the islands. There is no limit on the number of crates or refugees the helicopter can carry, and the player only needs to return to Base Island after the last crate has been found and loaded. Hindering progress is the cyclone itself, which can cause the helicopter to behave erratically at long range, and crash at close range. The position and progress of the cyclone can be monitored on the map enabling the player to determine when to vacate the area or when to carry out an emergency landing. While over open water the helicopter must avoid low flying planes which traverse the screen occasionally. The player also has limited fuel which can be replenished at helipads on several of the islands, and a time limit in which to retrieve the crates. The game screen is split into 2 areas, the main environment and the head-up display (HUD) that surrounds it. The heads up display contains instrumentation which includes speed, altitude, fuel remaining and time remaining. Additionally there is also information on the number of supply crates, whether your current view is North or South, information on wind force and a warning to the player of the cyclone's proximity and any approaching planes. The 3D aspect of the game allows the helicopter to not only move on the x-axis (left/right on screen) and the y-axis (up/down on screen), but also on the z-axis, representing its height in the sky. Lowering your height while directly above a crate or refugee automatically triggers the winch which pulls them up to safety. The helicopter casts a shadow which also helps with the illusion of 3 dimensions and gives an visual of your height. The graphics support this 3D environment in the form of cliffs, other terrain, buildings etc. The game also features an interesting game mechanic - the view has two aspects of North and South to switch between. This allows the player to view the environment from the two different angles, essential as some crates are hidden behind buildings or terrain so can only be seen from North or South. There is also a map view to help locate the cyclone and the islands. Once completed the game loops, with no change in difficulty. DevelopmentReception Following on from the success of Tornado Low Level, Cyclone met favourable reviews again praising the 3D visuals, however there were some reviewers that believed that these 3D visuals were actually a downgrade The gameplay itself was again met favourably with some reviews pleased with Cyclone's main focus - the departure from the \\"attack\\" gameplay of Tornado Low Level, and the move towards rescue based gameplay. But again there were some disagreements with the gameplay, with some claiming that there was not enough difference from its predecessor Tornado Low Level. It is clear from the reviews that the game was in direct comparison with its predecessor which may have affected the way it was received.

Marvel Comics. Powers and abilities Man Mountain Marko has been shown to have superhuman strength, stamina and sturdiness roughly comparable to, if not slightly exceeding, those of Spider-Man. It has been said that this is a result of steroids and genetic manipulation. He received a power upgrade from Tyler Stone after getting a vicious beating from Spider-Man 2099. Though Spider-Man had previously broken many of Marko's bones, afterward Spider-Man was unable to do any damage to Marko. Relatives During the Fear Itself storyline, it is revealed that Man Mountain Marko had a cousin named Man Mountain Mario who was an inmate at the Raft. After the destruction of the Raft prison by Juggernaut, Man Mountain Mario helps defend Crossbones from thugs.

It was an early adopter of an entirely server- based solution. ZyWeb was created to enable non-technical users to create and publish web sites without the need for any design, authoring or technical skills. History ZyWeb has been in service since 1998. The initial development was by two British companies with a common background in the world of Acorn computers, part of the ancient history of personal computing. Xara Ltd (www.xara.com), which had grown out of Computer Concepts, brought their experience with vector graphics to provide what remains one of ZyWeb's USPs, its \\"smart graphics\\". ZyNet Ltd (www.zynet.net), which had grown out of Minerva Software, brought their experience as one of the earliest ISPs in the UK. Once the product was launched, the two companies joined to form a new company, known as Zy.com, and this company followed the all-too-familiar progress of so many others during the dot com bubble of the 1990s. A something-for-nothing business model drove explosive growth in the user base, with numbers in the millions at its peak. Venture capital was attracted and millions of dollars were burned before the bubble burst and Zy.com collapsed. However, unlike so many other services, ZyWeb survived this period intact. One of the original founders, ZyNet Ltd, purchased the assets from the liquidated company and continued to develop and improve the service with a more viable business model. Technical Information ZyWeb is founded on a Windows platform, using ASP/VBScript to wrap up custom COM objects, largely written in C++. When development started in 1998, the available platform was Windows NT3.51 running IIS3. This suffered from a host of serious technical problems which had to be solved by either writing replacement code (e.g. the system uses its own session manager rather than the one provided by IIS) or by delegating operations to other platforms. A Linux based accelerator sits between the Windows cluster and the Internet and this provides a range of other services which were unavailable or unusable on Windows NT3.51. All this ran on a large collection of commodity servers which grew rapidly as the userbase expanded and came to include specialist hardware such as a NetApp filer. Today, things have moved on and ZyWeb runs on a relatively small cluster of modern servers with current editions of Windows which do not suffer nearly as many problems. However an updated Linux accelerator remains in place and continues to provide important additional services, particularly email management.

The Green Salt Project derives its name from uranium tetrafluoride, also known as green salt, an intermediate product in the conversion of uranium ore into uranium hexafluoride ‚Äî a toxic gas that can undergo enrichment or purification into fuel for nuclear reactors or bombs. Uranium tetrafluoride has also been used as the source of metallic uranium for Magnox reactor fuel elements via chemical reduction.

Publicity The Green Salt Project was initially brought to light by reports of a laptop computer in the CIA's possession which was supposedly smuggled out of Iran that contained a variety of information on Iran's alleged nuclear weapons program, from the design of underground testing facilities to schematics of nuclear missile warheads.Strong Leads and Dead Ends in Nuclear Case Against Iran, Dafna Linzer, Washington Post, 8 February 2006.

Three years later he helmed The Crew in an directorial effort that Variety called \\"misguided\\". Drowning on Dry Land, a 1999 film that he wrote and directed, drew praise for Barbara Hershey and criticism for a screenplay that made the film \\"destined for half-inch\\". His 2004 film The Affair was similarly panned, with Variety calling it a \\"homevid-bound indie drama that recalls the most pretentious pseudo-artsy product of the 1960s and '70s\\".

The show's title was the actual address of MTV's glass walled central London studio that overlooked the world- famous Leicester Square. It featured celebrity guests, musical entertainment and various asides featuring the presenter. The show was widely viewed as a vehicle for the comeback of Brand after his sacking from MTV in 2001. Format The show begins with an announcer introducing Brand. Controversially, he was once introduced as being \\"bigger than Jesus\\" in reference to a misquoted claim by John Lennon claiming that The Beatles were bigger than Jesus. After entering Brand sits in a flamboyantly upholstered chair with a zebra fabric for the seat covering. He then introduces the musical act for the show and they will play a track. After this, an announcer will introduce the first guest (usually the biggest star) with a comically fabricated fact or anecdote about them. The guest will then be interviewed whilst they sit on a sofa next to Brand. After this interview, there is usually a commercial break. After the break, Brand usually interviews the musical act that is on the show this week in another area of the studio. This is usually punctuated with a sketch and Daniel and Len's Video Review (see below). This interview is typically followed with another interview by Brand next to a mock bar with another celebrity. After this interview there is another commercial break. The last portion of the show is taken up with the segment For Pity's Sake Help Us (see below), followed by another performance from the guest musical act. Short features In series 2 of the show, all of the short features have been removed from the show with the exception of For Pity's Sake Help Us. Daniel and Len later appeared on Russell Brand's Got Issues, introducing each show with a skit loosely connected to the week's topic. Pimp My Application Pimp My Application is a spoof of the popular MTV UK show Pimp My Ride UK. It has only appeared once on the show. Russell Brand parodies Tim Westwood, giving him a hook for a hand, a peg leg and a squawking voice. Brand lampoons the show by using over-exaggerated street speak when describing how they are going to 'pimp' up a person's CV when he is applying for a job. For Pity's Sake Help Us This is a feature that Brand always ends the show with, save the last musical performance. Audience members are asked if they have any problems and these are then answered by some of the celebrities that have appeared earlier in the show. The Rats The Rats is a sketch that is performed before each of the commercial breaks and at the end of the show. Two rats are crudely manipulated and given human voices. They will usually engage in a short, humorous conversation that loosely relates to a topic of discussion in the previous segment. Minor characters=Gatwick Gatwick is a model of a man that loosely resembles Prince Charles and is occasionally used by Brand as a prop on the show. Dan the Researcher Dan is the show's mysterious researcher that Brand alludes to after fabricating or bringing up an obscure fact about his interviewee.

A follow-on version, the OQ-3, became the most widely used target drone in US service, with over 9,400 being built during World War II. History Marilyn Monroe with an RP-5's propeller The OQ-2 was originally a small radio controlled aircraft model designed by Walter Righter. The design, along with its engine design, was purchased by actor Reginald Denny, who had demonstrated another model to the US Army in 1940. Calling the new design the RP-2, he demonstrated several updated versions to the Army as the RP-2, RP-3 and RP-4 in 1939. In 1940, the Army placed an order for 53 RP-4s (some sources refer to the RP-4 as OQ-1. but that designation was never assigned). This small order led to a much bigger 1941 order for the similar RP-5, which became the US Army OQ-2, the OQ meaning a \\"subscale target\\". The US Navy also bought the drone, designating it TDD-1, for Target Drone, Denny, 1. Thousands were built, manufactured at the Radioplane plant at the Van Nuys Airport in the Los Angeles metropolitan area. It was at this factory on June 26, 1945 that Army photographer David Conover saw a young woman assembler named Norma Jeane Dougherty, whom he thought had potential as a model. She was photographed in the plant, which led to a screen test for Norma Jeane, who soon changed her name to Marilyn Monroe Description and variants The OQ-2 is a simple aircraft, powered by a two- cylinder two-cycle piston engine, providing and driving two contra-rotating propellers. The RC control system was built by Bendix. Launching was by catapult only and recovered by parachute should it survive the target practice. The landing gear was used only on the OQ-2 versions as sold to the Army to cushion the landing by parachute. None of the drones including the improved variants shipped to the Navy had landing gear. The subsequent variants delivered to the Army did not have landing gear. The OQ-2 led to a series of similar but improved variants, with the OQ-3 / TDD-2 and OQ-14 / TDD-3 produced in quantity. A number of other target drones were built by Radioplane (including licensed contractors) and competing companies during the war, most of which never got beyond prototype stage, which accounts for the gaps in the designation sequence between \\"OQ-3\\" and \\"OQ-14\\". After World War II ended, various experiment were made with Radioplane target drones. In one experiment in 1950, a derivative of the QQ-3 Radioplane drone was used to lay military communication wire.\\"Drone Plane Lays Wire\\" Popular Mechanics, October 1950, p. 96 During the war Radioplane manufactured nearly fifteen thousand drones.

Scottish Young Greens (official website). Retrieved 21 December 2018. Membership of the Scottish Young Greens is open to anyone aged 16 to 30 years old, so long as they are not members of a rival political party. The Scottish Young Greens work closely with the Young Greens of England and Wales and are members of the Federation of Young European Greens.  History  The Scottish Young Greens formally, and amicably, split from the Young Greens of England and Wales in 2003, more than ten years after the Scottish Green Party and the Green Party of England and Wales had similarly split. The two work closely together but remain independent organisations. The Scottish Young Greens have variously campaigned for the Scottish and UK Climate Bills, Fairtrade Universities, Votes at 16, a Free, Fair and Funded Education System, and against HMO Quotas. In 2007, they revealed that the University of Edinburgh invested substantially in TOTAL Oil, the biggest financial supporters of the Burmese Junta. Scottish Young Greens were also central to the preparations for the protests at the 2005 G8 Summit in Scotland. Following the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, a significant increase in the membership of the Scottish Green Party resulted in an influx of many new Young Greens. The Scottish Young Greens currently have local branches covering Glasgow & the West of Scotland, Edinburgh and Aberdeen & Aberdeenshire, as well as societies in a number of Scottish universities. In 2015, they launched their own manifesto ahead of the 2015 general election, including calls for the removal of benefit sanctions and the abolition of the so-called Bedroom tax. A number of Scottish Young Greens have been elected to public office. Ross Greer became the youngest MSP ever elected to the Scottish Parliament in the 2016 elections, representing the West Scotland region. In the 2017 local elections, 16% of Scottish Green Party candidates were Young Greens. Three were elected as councillors, out of a total of 19 Green councillors across Scotland, all to Glasgow City Council - Kim Long, Christy Mearns, and Allan Young.  Notable members  Scottish Young Greens have had a certain amount of success in student politics. Former Rector of the University of Edinburgh Peter McColl was Convener of the Young Greens between 2008 and 2010, and recent former Presidents/Vice Presidents of Edinburgh University Students' Association, Students Association of the University of the West of Scotland, Aberdeen University Student's Association, Stirling University's Student Union and Glasgow University Students' Representative Council have been Young Greens. The 2004-2005 Deputy President of NUS Scotland, Phyl Meyer, was also a Young Green, as was 2011‚Äì2013 NUS Scotland President Robin Parker. Young Greens led the successful election campaign of Mark Ballard as Rector of Edinburgh University. Scottish Young Greens James Smyth and Ross Greer have been Members of the Scottish Youth Parliament (2011‚Äì2013).

She had a top five hit on the German singles chart with \\"Goodbye Mama\\" in 1973. She went on to finish fourth at the Eurovision Song Contest 1974 representing Luxembourg, sixth at the Eurovision Song Contest 1978 representing Germany, and 13th for Luxembourg in 1985. Life and career Born in Romford, England, Sheer spent her early years in Billericay, Essex in the U.K. where she went to school. She was discovered at the beginning of the 1960s through a talent competition, but still took time to graduate from a bank apprenticeship in spite of her early success. She sang for several pop groups, such as The Family Dogg, before she devoted herself from 1970 onwards to her solo career, focusing mainly on Germany. Her single, \\"Goodbye Mama\\", became a Top 5 hit on the German chart in 1973. After that, she released numerous records, almost every one going on to become a hit in its own right. Sheer became a guest on several different television music-shows, including several appearances on ZDF Hitparade, one of Germany's most popular music programs. In 1974, she represented Luxembourg in the Eurovision Song Contest, with \\"Bye Bye, I Love You\\" and finished in fourth place. Four years later, in 1978, she sang for Germany and finished sixth. In 1985, Sheer sang together with Annemieke Verdoorn (Margo), Franck Olivier, Chris Roberts, Diane Solomon and Malcolm Roberts, once more representing Luxembourg. However, their song \\"Children, Kinder, Enfants\\" finished in thirteenth place. She took part in the contest two other times, in which she did not progress beyond the German preliminaries or finals: in 1976 with \\"Einmal Wasser, einmal Wein\\" (\\"Once Water, Once Wine\\") and in a 2002 duet with Bernhard Brink, singing \\"Es ist niemals zu sp√§t\\" (\\"It Is Never Too Late\\"). Besides her solo performances, Sheer also sang a number of duets with her ex-husband Gavin du Porter, and her colleague, Bernhard Brink. Over thirty years after her first hit, Sheer is still a well-known member of the pop music establishment in Germany, continuing to appear on music shows and release new albums and singles. Awards Sheer has received several gold records for her work, and has twice received the German music awardGema.de the Golden Tuning Fork, both in 1981 and 1993.

The company's original purpose was to run Galactic Conquest, the play-by-mail game which became Star Fleet Warlord. Galactic Conquest had originally been run as a hobby (first created in late 1989), but proved its worth in the first eight games as a legitimate play-by-mail game. The public debut came at Gen Con/Origins 1992, followed shortly by a deal to make it an official Star Fleet Universe product (a change of the name to the Star Fleet Warlord). Continental Conquest (then called Conquest of America) was written in 1992 and also started its first game at Gen Con/Origins. The European map was added in mid-1993 and the revision to the current rules (including the Oceania map) was completed in mid-1995. The concept for Babylon 5 Wars was created by Robert Glass in April 1996 and pitched to Agents of Gaming, and was nearly dismissed as an impossible prospect. Robert persisted, calling Warner Brothers, and was able to secure the license with the help of Agents of Gaming credentials. Kelly Lofgren was brought on board shortly thereafter.

In both novels, he is murdered by his adulterous wife Pan Jinlian. A well-known figure in Chinese culture, he represents the quintessential cuckold. Story Wu Dalang is the elder brother of the hero Wu Song. Because he is short and ugly, he is nicknamed \\"Three-inch nail\\". In contrast, Wu Song is a strong and powerful warrior with good looks. The brothers' parents died when they were young and Wu Dalang shouldered the responsibility of raising his younger brother. Wu Song once got into a fight and knocked out his opponent. He thought he had killed his opponent and fled to avoid arrest by the authorities. The brothers were later reunited after a long period of time. Wu Dalang was married to Pan Jinlian and the two were known to be quite close in the early days of their marriage and neighbours usually referred to their marriage as \\"a rose placed atop a pile of cow dung\\". Eventually the couple could not stand it and moved to Yanggu County. In Yanggu, Wu made a living by selling pancakes while his wife stayed at home and managed domestic affairs. By coincidence, the brothers were reunited in Yanggu after Wu Song had killed a tiger. The brothers lived together and were quite close. Pan Jinlian was attracted to the handsome Wu Song and tried to seduce him, but Wu Song shoved her away and left. Once, the county magistrate sent Wu Song out for an errand which took two months. During that time, Pan Jinlian had an adulterous affair with Ximen Qing, which Wu Dalang did not know about. The adulterous pair were making love when Wu Dalang returned home and caught them in the act. Ximen Qing hit Wu Dalang so hard that Wu Dalang was injured and fell ill. Pan Jinlian and Ximen Qing were worried that Wu Dalang might report their affair to Wu Song, who was serving as a head constable in the county office. Thus, they decided to finish Wu Dalang by poisoning his medicine. Wu Dalang drank the medicine and realised it was poison but was too late. He struggled but was eventually smothered with a pillow by his wife. Then, Ximen Qing had Wu Dalang's body cremated, and he tried to bribe the neighbours and the coroner to keep the affair a secret. When Wu Song returned from his errand he was shocked to hear of his brother's death. He started an investigation, found out about the adulterous affair and reported it to the magistrate. However, the magistrate had been bribed and he dismissed the case citing lack of evidence. Eventually, Wu Song managed to force a confession from Pan Jinlian and he killed her to avenge his brother. He then went to find Ximen Qing and after a fierce fight, killed Ximen and cut off his head as a sacrifice to his brother's spirit.

When animals eat foodstuffs, they also make random blocks fall on the opponent's area, right after the currently falling blocks. The object of the game is to make one's opponent unable to place more blocks. Reception In Japan, Game Machine listed Baku Baku Animal on their June 1, 1995 issue as being the eleventh most-successful arcade game of the year. The Saturn version was met with critical acclaim upon release, with Maximum calling it \\"the best 'next generation' puzzle game we've seen to date\\", Sega Saturn Magazine \\"some of the most addictive puzzle play since Tetris\\", GameSpot \\"a must own\\" for \\"Saturn owners who have even a remote interest in puzzle games\\", and GamePro \\"undeniably the best puzzle game in the world so far.\\" Critics lauded the addictive gameplay, especially in two-player competitive mode, but the ludicrously cute graphics and sounds were met with general approval as well. Reviewing the Game Gear version, the four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly commented that the gameplay concept of Baku Baku Animal is simple and accessible, yet has enough strategic possibilities to engage even veteran players. Andrew Baran summarized it as \\"non-threatening fun anyone can enjoy\\". Baku Baku won Computer Gaming Worlds 1996 \\"Classic/Puzzle Game of the Year\\" award. The editors wrote, \\"The beauty of this game [...] lies in its ability to suck you in and keep you coming back for more and more. If you haven't already tried it, beware: Baku Baku will eat up your time.\\" It was a finalist for the Computer Game Developers Conference's 1996 \\"Best Trivia or Puzzle Game\\" Spotlight Award, but lost the prize to You Don't Know Jack XL. Electronic Gaming Monthly named the Game Gear version a runner up for \\"Hand-Held Game of the Year\\" and the Saturn version a runner up for \\"Puzzle Game of the Year\\" (beaten in both cases by Tetris Attack). Baku Baku Animal was named the 72nd best computer game ever by PC Gamer UK in 1997. Other media A white label 12 inch EP consisting entirely of dance tracks using sound effects from Baku Baku Animal, recorded by The Dream Team and Timebase for the Suburban Base label, was circulated to disc jockeys in 1996.

They have many cultural similarities despite their different ethnologies. Xingu people represent fifteen tribes and all four of Brazil's indigenous language groups, but they share similar belief systems, rituals and ceremonies. Precolumbian history The Upper Xingu region was heavily populated prior to European and African contact. Densely populated settlements developed from 1200 to 1600 CE.Hackenberger, Michael J. et al. \\"Amazonia 1492: Pristine Forest or Cultural Parkland?\\" Science Magazine. 25 July 2003 (retrieved 25 June 2011) Ancient roads and bridges linked communities that were often surrounded by ditches or moats. The villages were pre-planned and featured circular plazas. Archaeologists have unearthed 19 villages so far.Wren, Kathleen. \\"Lost cities of the Amazon revealed.\\" 'NBC News' (retrieved 25 June 2019) Post-contact history Kuikuro from Mato Grosso Quarup funeral ritual Kuikuro oral history says Portuguese slavers arrived in the Xingu region around 1750. Xinuguano population was estimated in the tens of thousands but was dramatically reduced by diseases and slavery by Portuguese. In the centuries since the penetration of the Europeans into South America, the Xingu fled from different regions to avoid the spread of deadly disease and enslavement by the Portuguese. By the end of the 19th century, about 3,000 natives lived at the Alto Xingu, where their current political status has kept them protected against foreign intruders. By the mid twentieth century this number had been reduced by foreign epidemic diseases such as flu, measles, smallpox and malaria to less than 1,000. Only an estimated 500 Xingu peoples were alive in the 1950s. The Brazilian Villas-B√¥as brothers visited the area beginning in 1946, and pushed for the creation of the Parque Ind√≠gena do Xingu, eventually established in 1961. Their story is told in a film, Xingu. The number of Xingu living there in 32 settlements has risen again to over 3000 inhabitants, half of them younger than 15 years. The Xingu living in this region have similar habits and social systems, despite different languages. Specifically, they consist of the following peoples: the Aweti, Kalapalo, Kamaiur√°, Kayap√≥, Kuikuro, Matipu, Mehinako, Nahuku√°, Suy√°, Trumai, Wauja and Yawalapiti.

He died in Odessa in 1863. Biography Kegel was born in Rammelburg (now part of the town Mansfeld) and studied in Copenhagen. In the winter of 1826/1827 he went to Saint Petersburg. In 1841 he was sent by the Russian government to Kamchatka to investigate possibilities of agriculture and mining in that region. He traveled through Siberia, embarked in Okhotsk, only to arrive shipwrecked in Kamchatka. From Petropavlovsk, he undertook various voyages of several months into the heart of the country in order to examine the soil conditions and perform trial sowing. He travelled during the summer, even though traveling during this time was extremely strenuous and paths virtually impassable. His reports describe in detail flora and fauna, soil, geology as well as the life of the local population. Kegel discovered mineral resources and saw the potential wealth of the country if managed well. In addition, he made proposals for improving the living conditions of the indigenous population and criticized oppression. Kegel was loathed by the corrupt local administration, who were not interested in the development of the country but rather in their own profit from fur trade. When they realized that Kegel was incorruptible, he was victimized whenever possible. Still he succeeded in accomplishing his work and returned - in poor state of health - in 1847. His reports were the most precise ones of this era, but could not be published in his lifetime, since this would have meant loss of freedom or worse.

It lies within the Fire Island National Seashore. Davis Park is commonly used to refer to the business and public part of the community on both sides of Trustees' Walk, in contrast to the sections known as Leja Beach (to the west of Trustees Walk bounding Center Walk to the North and South) and Ocean Ridge (to the east). However, Davis Park is also used to refer to all three areas together, which are contiguous, share services and social life, and are separated from other communities on the island. Davis Park/Leja Beach/Ocean Ridge is the easternmost private community on Fire Island. (Formerly, there were other communities to the east that were removed by the National Park Service after the creation of Fire Island National Seashore in 1964. They included Bayberry Dunes, Whalehouse Point and Long Cove.) The community extends along approximately 3/4 mile (1.25 km) of beachfront, and is approximately 330 yards (0.3 km) wide at its widest and 190 yards (0.17 km) wide at its narrowest point (dune to bay, excluding ocean beach width). Davis Park is bordered by extensive wilderness areas to both east and west. The Watch Hill facility of the National Park Service (with a small marina, restaurant, campground, nature trail and seasonal tours and activities) is approximately 1/2 mile (0.8 km) east, and Water Island (a community, not a separate island) is approximately one mile (1.6 km) to the west. Davis Park lies approximately 13.9 miles (22.3 km) from the eastern end of Fire Island at Moriches Inlet and 16.3 miles (26.3 km) from the western end of Fire Island at Democrat Point (in Robert Moses State Park). The United States Post Office at Davis Park (open July and August only) lies at approximately 40¬∞41'04\\"N, 73¬∞00'15\\"W. To reach Davis Park, one must take a ferry (seasonal, mid-March to end of November) from Patchogue on the mainland of Long Island across the Great South Bay. Davis Park has approximately 350 homes (130 in Ocean Ridge and 220 in Davis Park), one general store and grill, one restaurant and one bar. The restaurant and bar are the only ones on Fire Island with a clear view of the bay and the ocean. There is one unpaved road, commonly called the Burma Road, and wooden boardwalks. There are no cars (except for emergency, utility and construction vehicles and a very limited number of private vehicles, which are only allowed through a strict permit process regulated by the National Park Service). There are no street lights except in the marina area, resulting in fine night time star-gazing. There are a Town of Brookhaven public marina, a (seasonally) lifeguarded section of beach and public restrooms and showers. Davis Park is protected by the all- volunteer Davis Park Fire Department and by Suffolk County Police. The non- for-profit Davis Park Medical Association owns a house, \\"Bedside Manor,\\" on the dune in Ocean Ridge, which is rented in season to doctors and nurse practitioners at a below-market rate in exchange for their agreement to provide basic medical services through scheduled office hours and on-call availability. Bedside Manor is equipped with basic medical equipment and supplies. A helipad provides emergency evacuation capability. Fire Island is said to be the only significant barrier island in the United States without paved roads and automobiles. Its all-sand beaches, like other beaches in the State of New York, are public. History The origins of Davis Park can be tracked back to the 1940s. It all started with Mr. Davis of Blue Point who owned a tract of land of Fire Island. When he passed away he left some of the land to his sons. One of those sons sold his share of the land to four friends (Lee Coffin, Ed Shembler, Joe Gerard, and Al Brown) who would later go on to build the Davis Park Casino. 2009 Beach Renourishment In the winter and spring of 2009, a beach renourishment project was undertaken on Fire Island, with the cooperation of the National Park Service, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Towns of Brookhaven and Islip and Fire Island residents. The renourishment program involved dredging sand from an offshore borrow area, pumping it onto the beach and shaping the sand into an approved beach face and dune template in front of the communities of Davis Park, Corneille Estates, Dunewood, Fair Harbor, Fire Island Pines, Fire Island Summer Club, Lonelyville, Ocean Bay Park, Ocean Beach, Saltaire, and Seaview. Fire Islanders agreed to a significant property tax increase to help pay for the project, which was estimated to cost between $23 and $25 million, including the cost of environmental monitoring, and was expected to add 1.8 million cubic yards of sand in front of the participating communities. The Towns of Brookhaven and Islip, in which the communities are located, issued bonds to pay for the project, backed by the new taxes levied by community Erosion Control Taxing Districts. Fire Island has been named by the American Shore and Beach Preservation Association a winner of its 2009 Best Restored Beach award. In November 2009, the remnants of Hurricane Ida, by then nicknamed the \\"nor' Ida,\\" did substantial damage to the beachfront in Davis Park, carrying away much of the sand of the previous spring's beach renourishment project. New York Governor David A. Paterson asked President Barack Obama to declare a major federal disaster for the counties of Nassau, Queens and Suffolk (including Fire Island) for the severe erosion and damage to the protective barrier beaches.

It is distinguished as the first stone monastery of the Russian North.  Overview  Kamenny Island (literally, \\"Stone Island\\") is very small, measuring just 120 metres by 70 metres. It is so named after stone ramparts set up by the monks around the island's perimeter in order to preclude its erosion. The lake is known for its inclement weather and frequent storms. The monastery was quite rich, owning seven larger villages (selo), four average villages (seltso) and 98 small villages, in addition to two salt pans in Totma and two branches in Vologda.  History  The katholikon before its demolition in the 1920s. It is believed that during one of such storms in 1269 Duke Gleb of Beloozero was cast ashore, where he found a small monastic community. The legends of the monks attribute the construction of the first timber cathedral on the isle to the funds subsequently provided by that monarch. Under Dmitry Donskoy, the Kamenny Monastery was run by Dionisius, a Greek monk who introduced the coenobian rule of Mount Athos, whereby the brethren were closed alike, took their meals (usually limited to bread and scarce vegetables) in the refectory and were bound to possess no private property. Female animals were banned from the isle to avoid any impure thought on the part of the monks. The monastic community reached its peak under Paisiy Yaroslavov, a former hegumen of the Trinity Lavra and one of the most influential clerics of the time. This starets authored The Tale of the Kamenny Monastery whose main themes are the history of this monastery and the struggle of its monks against paganism in the area. In 1476 the monastery burnt down. Ivan III's brother Andrey Menshoy, who was the ruler of Vologda, commissioned a stone four-pillared cathedral to be built on the island. The two-storey two- domed edifice was constructed in 1481 by a team of masters from Rostov, who proceeded to erect very similar cathedrals in the Ferapontov Monastery (1490) and Kirillo-Belozersky Monastery (1497). Paisiy Yaroslavov mentions that he engaged the great artist Dionisius to paint a deesis for the cathedral. It is believed that Dionisius's works perished 185 years later, during a great fire, which resulted in the collapse of the domes. In the 16th century, the Kamenny Monastery did not develop as quickly as the two last-mentioned abbeys, because of the limited territory that the tiny and remote island could afford. In the 1540s, the monks constructed a church-belltower of curious architecture and a refectory, after which the monastery gradually declined to obscurity. It was remembered in Moscow primarily as a place of exile, where the famous Old Believer, Ivan Neronov, was deported. On 24 July 1774 one of the exiles set the monastery on fire, whereupon the monks were transferred for 26 years to Vologda. When they finally returned to the island in 1801, the cathedral was restored with five domes instead of one. The only post-medieval buildings on the island were an inn and two lighthouses, built for the needs of the monastery in the 1870s.  Closure and destruction  The Soviet government closed down the Kamenny Monastery in 1925 and had its brethren evacuated from the island. The buildings were adapted to house a penal colony for minor delinquents. This establishment proved a failure and by 1937 the island had been deserted. The regional administration profited from the situation to blow up the oldest building of the Russian North in order to obtain brick required for construction of the local \\"palace of culture\\", which eventually failed to materialise. The ruins of the cathedral are still in situ.Pictures of the monastery ruin , the only building marking the spot of the historic monastery is the church belltower from the 1540s, which is now being repaired by a team of enthusiasts from Vologda and Moscow.  Restoration  In October, 2017, the Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church officially decided to reopen Spaso-Kamenny Preobrazhensky monastery with Dionisiy (Vozdvizhenskiy) as hegumen.Journal of the Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church meeting  Online references  * Kamenny Monastery Restoration Fund * Kamenny Monastery and Dionisius * http://rt.com/shows/documentary/diaries-island-pligin- monastery-141/ *((ru icon)) (in English) https://www.supernewsworld.com/Russian-Skydivers-Restoring-An-Ancient-Island- Monastery-9566482.html References Russian Orthodox monasteries in Russia Buildings and structures in Vologda Oblast 1925 disestablishments in the Soviet Union ","title":"Kamenny Monastery"},{"id":"6352065","text":"Human rights in Yemen are seen as problematic in numerous ways. The security forces have been responsible for torture, inhumane treatment and even extrajudicial executions. But according to the Embassy of Yemen, in recent years there has been some improvement, with the government signing several international human rights treaties, and even appointing a woman, Dr. Wahiba Fara‚Äôa, to the role of Minister of the State of Human Rights.Embassy of Yemen: Human Rights and Women's issues accessed 9-8-2006 Other sources state that many problems persist alongside allegations that these reforms have not been fully implemented and that abuses still run rampant, especially in the areas of women's rights, freedom of the press, torture and police brutality.Human Rights Watch: World Report 2001 on Yemen accessed 9-8-2006 There are arbitrary arrests of citizens as well as arbitrary searches of homes. Prolonged pretrial detention is a serious problem, and judicial corruption, inefficiency, and executive interference undermine due process. Freedom of speech, the press and religion are all restricted. In 2018 and 2019, numerous sources, including the United Nations described the human rights situation in Yemen as being the worst in the world. Treaties Yemen is a party to the following human rights agreements: *The Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) *The Convention Relating the Status of Refugees *The Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination *The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights *The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights *The International Convention on the Ban of Genocide *The International Convention on War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity *The International Convention on Women's Political Rights *The Convention on Marriage Consent and Minimum Marriage Age and Marriage Contracts Registration *The Convention on the Ban of Human Trading and Exploitation *The International Convention on the Prohibition of Racial Discrimination *The International Convention on the Rights of the Child *The International Convention on Anti-Torture, Cruel Treatment and Inhumanity *The 1994 Geneva Agreement and their 1997 Annexed Protocol Women In spite of the Yemeni Constitution of 1994, which stipulates equal rights for Yemeni citizens, women are still struggling with various constraints and secondary status. Yemen's Personal Status Law in particular, which covers matters of marriage, divorce, child custody and inheritance, gives women fewer rights than men, excludes women from decision making, and deprives them of access to, and control over, resources and assets. The right to divorce is not given to women equally. It is far more difficult for a woman to divorce a man. A man may divorce a woman at will. While a man may divorce without justifying his action in court, a woman must present adequate justification. Women face many practical, social, and financial negative considerations in divorce procedure. One significant case to gain worldwide publicity was that of Nujood Ali, who succeeded in obtaining a divorce at age ten, with the help of a prominent female Yemeni lawyer who agreed to represent her. Yemen has one of the worst records of child marriage in the world, with UNICEF recording in 2005 that 48.4% of Yemeni women currently aged 20‚Äì24 had been married before they were 18 (and 14% before the age of 15). Prior to the unification of Yemen in 1990, the law set the minimum age of marriage at 16 in South Yemen and 15 in the north. After unification, the law was set at 15. In 1999, the civil status law was amended and the minimum age was abolished. From April 2010, a controversial new law set the minimum age for marriage at 17. The bill was actively opposed by conservative parliamentarians on the basis that fixing a minimum age of marriage contradicts Islam. Other factors contributing to child marriage include embedded cultural traditions, economic pressures on girls' parents, and the value placed on young girls' virginity and consequent desire to protect them from sexual relationships outside of marriage. Other potential factors include older husbands' desire for young, submissive wives, and the belief that young girls are less likely to be carriers of HIV and AIDS. The dangers of early marriage to girls include the increased health risks associated with early pregnancies, social isolation, an increased risk of exposure to domestic violence and a cutting short of girls' education, further contributing to the 'feminisation of poverty'. Women's access to maternal health care is severely restricted. In most cases, husbands decide women's fertility. It is hard for women to obtain contraception, or to take operation for treatment without a husband's permission. Yemen's high child mortality rate and the fourth fastest growing population in the world are attributed to a lack of women's decision-making in their pregnancy and access to healthcare services. Women are vulnerable to sexual assault by prison guards, and there is a lower, if any, punishment for violence against women than men. The law stipulates protection of women from domestic violence, but in fact there are few protections for women who suffer from domestic violence and no systematic investigation of such occurrences has been conducted. Spousal abuse or domestic violence is not generally reported to the police because of social norms and customs, meaning that women remain silent under these abuses. Freedom of the press In 2005, Yemen ranked 136th of 167 nations in terms of press freedom.Reporters Without Borders: 2005 Annual Worldwide Press Freedom Index accessed 8-8-2006 The government holds a monopoly on all television and radio and bans journalists for publishing \\"incorrect\\" information.Reporters Without Borders: 2004 report on Yemen accessed 9-8-2006 In 2001, journalists at the newspaper Al-Shura received 80 lashes for defaming Abdul Majeed al-Zindani, the leader of the country's largest Islamist party. The newspaper was also shut down. According to Human Rights Watch, \\"Under the regulations for the 1990 Press Law, issued in 1993 and 1998, newspapers have to apply to the Ministry of Information for annual renewal of their license... in mid-2000 only about half of Yemen's 200 publications had been granted a license.\\"Human Rights Watch news: Yemen: Closure of Newspaper, Journalist Flogging accessed 9-8-2006 The UN Human Rights Office (OHCHR) documented several human rights violations against journalists in Yemen that included killings, disappearances and death sentences committed by the parties warring in the Yemeni armed conflict. On June 2, 2020, in Dar Sa‚Äôad district, AFP journalist Nabeel Al-Qitee‚Äôe was assassinated in front of his home. On 11 April 2020, 4 journalists were sentenced to death and 6 others were jailed by the Specialized Criminal Court in the capital of Sana‚Äôa, controlled by Houthi rebels. Since the start of the conflict in 2015, 24 media organizations have been seized, 26 TV channels and newspaper agencies were shut down. According to OHCHR, 357 human rights violations and abuses were documented to have taken place against journalists, including 184 arrests and detentions, 28 killings, 45 assaults, 2 forced disappearances and one abduction. Freedom of religion The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the Government generally respected this right in practice; however, there were some restrictions. The Constitution declares that Islam is the state religion, and that Shari'a (Islamic law) is the source of all legislation. Government policy continued to contribute to the generally not free practice of religion; however, there were some restrictions. Muslims and followers of religious groups other than Islam are free to worship according to their beliefs, but the Government prohibits conversion from Islam and the proselytization of Muslims.United States Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor. Yemen: International Religious Freedom Report 2007 . This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. Although relations among religious groups continued to contribute to religious freedom, there were some reports of societal abuses and discrimination based on religious belief or practice. There were isolated attacks on Jews and some prominent Zaydi Muslims felt targeted by government entities for their religious affiliation. Government military reengagement in the Saada governorate caused political, tribal, and religious tensions to reemerge in January 2007, following the third military clash with rebels associated with the al-Houthi family, who adhere to the Zaydi school of Shi'a Islam. Since the start of the Shia insurgency, many Zaidis accused of supporting Al-Houthi, have been arrested and held without charge or trial. According to the US Department of State, International Religious Freedom Report 2007, \\"Some Zaydis reported harassment and discrimination by the Government because they were suspected of sympathizing with the al-Houthis. However, it appears the Government's actions against the group were probably politically, not religiously, motivated\\". LGBT rights Homosexuality is illegal in Yemen in accordance with the country's Shari'ah legal system. International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission: Status of Sexual minorities ‚Äì Yemen LGBT persons in Yemen are likely to suffer discrimination, legal, and social challenges. Punishments for homosexuality range from flogging to death.New book details increase in antigay violence worldwideAn FCO programme for promoting the human rights of LGBT people Yemen is one of only seven countries to apply a death penalty for consensual sexual acts between adults of the same sex.World Day against Death Penalty: 7 countries still put people to death for same-sex acts Gay and lesbian websites are blocked by the government. As of 2007, there was no public or semi-public space for gays as in western countries. The official position is that there are no gays in Yemen.And then there was Yemen. As a result of Sharia, LGBT people are killed in attacks. The government does not protect its gay citizens from violence. Human trafficking The United States Department of State 2013 Trafficking in Persons report has classified Yemen as a Tier 3 country, meaning that its government does not fully comply with the minimum standards against human trafficking and is not making significant efforts to do so.  Violations of Children's Rights during Civil War Amnesty International denounced the recruitment of young boys under the age of 17 at hands of the Yemen's Houthi armed group to fight as child soldiers on the front lines of the Yemeni Civil War. In mid-February 2017, four boys, aged between 15 and 17, were recruited by Huthis in Sana'a; the total numbers of the boys recruited is unknown. Since the children have been excited to shoot Kalashnikovs and guns and wear military uniforms, Houthis have run local centers that hold activities such as prayers, sermons and lectures where they have been encouraged to join front-line battles to defend Yemen against Saudi Arabia. As the report clarified, they always take one recruit from each family; and when son dies, a monthly salary, estimated between 20,000 and 30,000 Yemeni Riyals, has been given to the family. According to the UN agencies, nearly 1,500 cases of children were recruited by all parties to the conflict since March 2015. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates hired child soldiers from Sudan (especially from Darfur), and Yemen to fight against Houthis during the Yemeni Civil War (2015-present). British SAS special forces are allegedly involved in training child soldiers in Yemen. Reportedly at least 40% of soldiers fighting for the Saudi-led coalition are children. Saudi Arabia is also hiring Yemeni child soldiers to guard Saudi border against Houthis. Secret prisons The UAE runs secret prisons in Yemen where prisoners are forcibly disappeared and tortured. The US also admitted to interrogating prisoners but denied \\"any participation in or knowledge of human rights abuses\\".

The original Gamma Flight served as the first tier in the three-tier process of becoming a member of Alpha Flight as instituted by Department H. Gamma Flight was mostly raw recruits. After a training period, theoretically they would be upgraded to Beta Flight and eventually to Alpha Flight, the premiere official superhero team of Canada. The members were Diamond Lil, Smart Alec, Wild Child, and Madison Jeffries. Many former Gamma Flight members were convinced by Jerry Jaxon and Delphine Courtney to join Omega Flight in his bid to destroy James Hudson. Canadian government sanctioned team The Canadian government founded a new sanctioned superhero team after the disappearance of Alpha Flight. This Gamma Flight included Nemesis, Wildchild, Silver, Auric and Witchfire. With Alpha Flight implicated in various misdeeds that occurred, Gamma Flight had orders to bring them to the authorities. This team was later disbanded in a merger with Department H and Alpha Flight with some members leaving. Support operation In a revived Department H, Gamma Flight refers to support operations.

He was a maternal uncle of Emperor Xuanwu, and he became increasingly powerful during Emperor Xuanwu's reign, drawing anger from other high-level officials not only for his powerplay (including involvement in the death of the highly regarded imperial prince Yuan Xie) and corruption, but also because he was a mere commoner before Emperor Xuanwu's reign and not from the aristocracy and might have been Korean in origin. After Emperor Xuanwu died in 515, the other officials set a trap for Gao Zhao and had him killed. Background Gao Zhao claimed that his ancestors were from Bohai Commandery (ÂãÉÊµ∑, roughly Cangzhou, Hebei), and that his fifth generation ancestor Gao Gu (È´òÈ°ß), in order to flee the wars during the times of Emperor Huai of Jin, fled to the Korean Peninsula. Gao Zhao's father Gao Yang (È´òÈ¢∫) defected to Northern Wei during the reign of Emperor Xiaowen and was given a minor general title and created the Viscount of Hejian. Emperor Xiaowen also took Gao Yang's daughter as an imperial consort, and she gave birth to his second son, Yuan Ke in 483. Yuan Ke was initially not crown prince, but became crown prince in 497 after his only older brother Yuan Xun was deposed from that position in 496, and his mother Consort Gao, whom Emperor Xiaowen initially left in the old capital Pingcheng (Âπ≥Âüé, in modern Datong, Shanxi) and did not bring to the new capital Luoyang when he moved the capital in 494, was welcomed to the new capital, but on the way, she died suddenly. (Historians largely believe that Emperor Xiaowen's wife Empress Feng Run, who wanted to raise Yuan Ke on her own, murdered Consort Gao.) Gao Zhao and his brothers never had any actual contact with Yuan Ke during his youth. Despite the fact that Gao Yang did have a minor noble title, it appeared that his family was essentially treated as commoners and regarded as uncultured. Rise to power In 499, Emperor Xiaowen died, and Yuan Ke succeeded him (as Emperor Xuanwu). Emperor Xuanwu posthumously honored his mother Consort Kao as Empress Wenzhao and his grandfather Gao Yang as Duke of Bohai. He summoned Gao Yang's oldest grandson Gao Meng (È´òÁåõ) and his uncles Gao Zhao and Gao Xian (È´òÈ°Ø) and, at their first meeting, immediately created them dukes‚Äîin Gao Zhao's case, the Duke of Pingyuan. Emperor Xuanwu awarded the three of them large amounts of property. Gao Zhao was not only given a noble title, but starting from 499 he became increasingly important on the political scene as well. He was initially looked down upon by the nobility because he came from the Korean Peninsula, and, despite his claims of Han ancestry, was considered to be a dishonorable barbarian, but as his power grew, he was praised for his diligence in handling the matters he was in charge of. His power began to grow greatly in 501, when Emperor Xuanwu, aged 15, relieved his princely uncles Yuan Xi (ÂÖÉÁ¶ß) the Prince of Xianyang and Yuan Xie the Prince of Pengcheng of their high level posts, and ostensibly took over power himself‚Äîbut being unable to actually handle all important matters of state due to his age, and thus entrusting much of those affairs to Gao and other close associates. Later that year, Yuan Xi was forced to commit suicide when his plot to secede with the southern half of the empire was discovered, and his property was seized and awarded to Gao and the trusted associate Zhao Xiu (Ë∂ô‰øÆ), and from this point on Emperor Xuanwu became increasingly suspicious of members of the imperial clan, making his reliance on Gao even greater. In 502, both Gao and the official Zhang Yi (ÂºµÂΩù) wanted to marry Emperor Xuanwu's aunt, the Princess Chenliu. The princess decided to marry Zhang and not Gao, and this caused Gao to be angry. He falsely accused Zhang of crimes, and Zhang was relieved from his post. in 503, Emperor Xuanwu took the daughter of Gao Zhao's brother Gao Yan (È´òÂÅÉ) as a concubine and favored her greatly, further cementing Gao Zhao's power. By that point, Gao was in a power struggle with Zhao, who was believed to be corrupt and extravagant in his living. He induced Zhao's associates Zhen Chen (ÁîÑÁêõ), Li Ping (ÊùéÊÜë), and Wang Xian (ÁéãÈ°Ø) to accuse Zhao of crimes and torture him, and Zhao died shortly thereafter. From this point on, Gao's hold on the emperor was unchallenged. Increasing power In 504, Emperor Xuanwu's uncle Yuan Xiang (ÂÖÉË©≥) the Prince of Beihai, who was then prime minister, grew increasingly arrogant and corrupt. Yuan Xiang had an affair with a cousin of Gao Zhao, who was the wife of Yuan Xie (ÂÖÉÁáÆ, not the same person as the Prince of Pengcheng) the Prince of Anding, and through her Gao apparently became aware of Yuan Xiang's crimes, and so he used the evidence of those crimes to further accuse Yuan Xiang of plotting treason. Emperor Xuanwu stripped Yuan Xiang of his title and posts, and Yuan Xiang soon thereafter died, and his associates were executed. Gao further suggested Emperor Xuanwu to put the imperial princes under heavy guard, and, despite opposition from Yuan Xie the Prince of Pengcheng, Emperor Xuanwu agreed, effectively putting those princes under house arrest. In 507, Gao's power was so well known that after the famed music director Gongsun Chong (ÂÖ¨Â≠´Â¥á) spent three years trying to get his revisions to imperial musical numbers adopted officially but was unable to, he had a solution‚Äîasking Gao to be in charge of the project, despite Gao's lack of musical knowledge. Emperor Xuanwu approved of the appointment, allowing Gongsun's project to proceed. Later that year, Emperor Xuanwu's wife Empress Yu died, and in early 508 her son (and Emperor Xuanwu's only son by that point) Yuan Chang (ÂÖÉÊòå) died as well. It was believed, although unproven, that both Empress Yu and Yuan Chang were murdered by Gao Zhao and Consort Gao. In 508, Emperor Xuanwu created Consort Gao empress, despite opposition by Yuan Xie the Prince of Pengcheng. Gao Zhao thereafter became resentful of Yuan Xie. When Emperor Xuanwu's brother Yuan Yu (ÂÖÉÊÑâ) the Prince of Jingzhao rebelled that year after believing that Gao was falsely accusing him, Gao in turn falsely accused Yuan Xie of working both in concert with Yuan Yu and rival Liang Dynasty. Emperor Xuanwu believed this, and secretly forced Yuan Xie to commit suicide during an imperial gathering. The populace quickly came to believe that Gao was involved in the death of the highly popular Yuan Xie, and from that point on Gao became even more despised by the people and nobles alike. Apparently apprehensive about this resentment, when Gao Zhao's son Gao Zhi (È´òÊ§ç) made contributions in subsequently defeating Yuan Yu, Gao Zhi declined all awards offered him. In 512, Gao Zhao was made prime minister, but was displeased because at the same time he was relieved of a lower post that allowed him to meet with the emperor daily. This display of displeasure became the topic of ridicule among officials. That year, because of a drought, Gao advocated the review of all criminal cases to see if unfair treatment had displeased the gods, and Emperor Xuanwu's brother Yuan Yi (ÂÖÉÊáå) the Prince of Qinghe accused Gao of overstepping his authorities. Emperor Xuanwu, while not punishing Yuan Yi for the accusation, also took no actions against Gao. Death In the winter of 515, Emperor Xuanwu wanted to try to capture rival Liang's Yi Province (modern Sichuan and Chongqing), and he commissioned Gao Zhao as the commander of the expedition force. Soon after Gao Zhao left the capital Luoyang, however, Emperor Xuanwu died of a sudden illness in spring 515. Emperor Xuanwu's crown prince Yuan Xu (ÂÖÉË©°), then age five, succeeded him (as Emperor Xiaoming). In the confusion of the events, Empress Gao tried to have Emperor Xiaoming's mother Consort Hu killed, but could not. Meanwhile, the official Yu Zhong and the imperial princes (Emperor Xuanwu's uncles) Yuan Cheng (ÂÖÉÊæÑ) the Prince of Rencheng and Yuan Yong the Prince of Gaoyang seized power, forcing Empress Gao, who was honored as empress dowager, to appoint Yuan Cheng and Yuan Yong as regents. The princely regents then wrote Gao Zhao a humble letter, in Emperor Xiaoming's name, summoning Gao back to the capital. When Gao heard of Emperor Xuanwu's death and realized that the princes were in power, he became fearful and mournful, and his body became weak. When he arrived in Luoyang's vicinity, his family members arrived to greet him, but he refused to see them. When he then entered the palace to mourn Emperor Xuanwu, the princes and Yu seized him and had him strangled. Emperor Xiaoming then issued an edict in which it was claimed that Gao had committed suicide, and the edict stripped him of his posts and title, but was buried with honors due a scholar. Subsequently, Empress Dowager Gao was deposed and replaced with Consort Hu, and the Gao clan lost its power.

The ZIP Code for Ocean Bay Park is 11770. To reach Ocean Bay Park, one must take a ferry or water taxi from Maple Avenue, Bay Shore on the mainland. Housing includes group houses and family homes. Nightlife and full-service restaurants include Flynn's (who also has a 50-boat marina) and the Schooner Inn. Ocean Bay Park was once filled with college and recently graduated young people, but has since shifted to a more family friendly community. This community has always been home to many somewhat older affluent home owners who enjoy the laid back beauty of Fire Island with family and friends. The residents of Ocean Bay Park have a history of being on the forefront of social change. On September 2, 1967 Dr. Martin Luther King was the guest of honor at a cocktail party held by Mr. and Mrs. Hyman Abbott as a fundraiser for his work. Earlier that day Dr. King \\"spoke about community, the war in Vietnam, anti-Semitism and the need for a third political party.\\" 1,500 residents attended that rally in Seaview. Then, as today, the unique paths of Fire Island provide the core ingredients a summer village needs. There is a grocery store, three bar-restaurants, two pizza places, and a bike shop outside the Schooner Inn. Enough amenities to keep any weekender happy.

History It was raised by Brevet Major William Stephen Raikes Hodson during the Indian Rebellion of 1857, and exists today as the 4th Horse Regiment in the Indian Army. The first risala or troop was raised by Sardar Man Singh. The force was raised as an irregular cavalry regiment to assist with putting down the rebellion, and continued as part of the British Indian Army. The official designation has changed several times since the regiment's inception in 1857. In 1859, the regiment was split up into two regiments which survived broadly as the 9th Bengal Lancers and 10th Bengal Lancers. In 1878, the 10th Bengal Lancers came to be known as the \\"Duke of Cambridge's own.\\" In 1921, the British decided to cut down on the number of cavalry regiments, and re-amalgamated the two as the 10th Duke of Cambridge's Own Lancers (Hodson's Horse). 9th Hodson's Horse in Damascus 2 October 1918 The regiment fought at the Battle of the Somme and the Battle of Cambrai in the First World War.

The building had considerable parking facilities, covered terracing and a bar with a view of the track. It had a capacity of 5,000. The stadium was constructed in the early 1970s and hosted greyhound racing until 2003, and speedway and stock cars until its closure at the end of the 2019 season. Origins Since 1912 the land south of Chesterton and north of Newcastle-under-Lyme was dominated by the imposing Holditch colliery. The colliery was responsible for mining coal and ironstone creating a tangled web of railway lines, pits and an unused 18th century canal. In the early 1970s a speedway and greyhound track was constructed giving the area the first speedway and greyhound racing since the closures of Hanley Greyhound Stadium and Cobridge Stadium. The colliery was experiencing heavy investment at the same time which also incentivised the construction. Greyhound racing Russell Bragg entered into an agreement with John Bryant to start greyhound racing and the first meeting took place on 11 April 1975. There were forty racing kennels on site and the track was known as Chesterton Greyhound Stadium. The track had a small circumference and consisted of 400 and 525 yards before it was switched in February 1979 to the more traditional practice of being located on the outside of the speedway circuit. Unusually for a greyhound track it had been on the inside of the speedway which clearly limited the type of greyhound that could manoeuvre around the tight bends. The switch included a new 'Outside Sumner' hare system. The new distances were initially measured at 259, 455 and 658 metres with the total cost of the alterations being ¬£15,000. Directors Bill Corbett and Jack Eisenberg successfully applied to join the National Greyhound Racing Club permit scheme in the summer of 1981 but just one year later the experiment had failed and Chesterton reverted to independent status (unaffiliated to a governing body) on 30 November 1982. Stephen Pardoe the Racing Manager stated that \\"the reasons were purely economic\\". The costs of registrations and transfers were turning owners away and with the re-opening of the rival Cobridge track they were left with no choice but to leave the permit scheme. During the late 1980s and the 1990s the racing schedule continued on Wednesday and Friday nights at 7.30pm with trials on Thursday and Sunday. Race distances of 272, 425, 469, 673 and 815 metres formed the basis of meetings around a 360-metre circumference course. Events included the Tardelli Handicap and Potters Classic which was overseen by Newcastle-under-Lyme Stadium Ltd. One of the prominent track trainers was Jimmy Gibson. Track manager Dave Tattum ended the greyhound racing in 2003. Speedway In 1973, Chesterton Potters speedway was founded by stadium owner Russell Bragg, and they rode the first season before changing their name to the Stoke Potters. In the latter period of the stadium's operation, it hosted mainly motorcycle speedway,Bamford, R & Jarvis J.(2001). Homes of British Speedway. and it was the home stadium of two speedway teams: the Stoke Potters and the Stoke Spitfires, who raced on Saturdays and Wednesdays respectively. During the 2017 season, the stadium also hosted the home race nights for the Carmarthen Dragons while they continued working towards their own venue and a return of league speedway in Wales. It held the Stoke Potters' last race on 14 September 2019, as the stadium was sold off to a housing developer. Other events It also hosted occasional BriSCA Formula 1 Stock Cars and BriSCA Formula 2 Stock Cars meetings and various events such as firework displays and occasional shows.

It has over 500 registered members and it holds minimal support in the local community. Through its work, the APDR defends a model of sustainable development based in the rational use of sea and forest resources, and a tourism model not based in the idea of mass tourism. The organisation is open to any citizen interested in the rehabilitation of the ria and its adjacent areas. Most of its work is focused in the fight against the main industries,Retired doctor comments on the possible effects of contamination in the ria , from newspaper A Nosa Terra (20 September 2008) such as the timbering company TAFISA (already relocated) and the pulp mill/paper mill and electrochemical complex ENCE-ELNOSA. Campaigns The APDR currently has three main active campaigns: * Paper mills: with a focus on the closure of the operations of the ENCE pulp mill/paper mill in Pontevedra's ria. Likewise, APDR opposes to the construction of new ENCE and Botnia pulp mills in Entre R√≠os (Argentina) and R√≠o Negro (Uruguay). * Littoral modification: in particular rejecting the modifications to Mar√≠n's port and the construction of a new harbour in Bueu. * Sustainable forest management. The APDR also focusses on ensuring that certifications awarded by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) follow the required criteria in the ria area, and that these are observed by the relevant authorities. In addition to the mentioned campaigns, the APDR also entertains parallel campaigns related to the environment and health issues, such as the relation between mobile phone radiation and health, protection and rational development of the local seafood industry, etc. Collaborations The APDR works in collaboration with a number of other environmental networks that aim to protect the environment, the Galician rivers Gafos, L√©rez and Verdugo, and with particular citizens initiatives. The APDR, in association with some of these other groups and/or individuals, have submitted a series of environmental and urbanism proposals to the local government of Pontevedra. From 1999, the APDR is member of the Galician Environmental Federation (Federaci√≥n Ecoloxista Galega - FEG), and from 2002 of the civic platform Nunca M√°is. Accomplished goals The APDR initially managed to open investigations on the fulfilment of environmental regulations by ENCE.Press note, commenting on ENCE-ELNOSA officials being investigated and prosecuted (October 1994) However, lack of support from the administration at that time reduced the effect of the APDR's early campaigns. It was only from 1999, with the arrival of a new governing team to Pontevedra's City Council, when APDR began to have institutional support and therefore was able to achieve specific goals. The APDR critically backed the local government of Pontevedra, forming an environmental lobby, that eventually forced the relocation of the timbering company TAFISA. In the 2001-2002 period, the APDR also gained the support of the Galician government on the grounds of health and environmental concerts to speed up the process.Article from La Voz de Galicia , on how TAFISA was being investigated by justice on possible irregularities and environmental law breaches (1 February 2002)Article from Xornal.com, on how the Galician government urges TAFISA to close its Pontevedra factory and relocate (9 February 2002) The local government of Pontevedra, in association with the Galician government and APDR, negotiated the eventual closure of the ENCE-ELNOSA complex. However, the agreed date of year 2018 was considered as \\"unacceptable\\" by the APDR, which is now trying to force an earlier closure of the company.

It was not until 1994 that Hazel Green School's upper grades were formed into Hazel Green High School (grades 9‚Äì12.) In 2010, a sixteen million-dollar renovation and addition was completed. This addition added eleven new classrooms (including two biology/chemistry labs, home economics labs and a special needs facility), a band room, a new gymnasium, and a cafetorium. The old cafetorium was remodeled into a black box theater.  Mascot  Originally, due to the town's name, Hazel Green School was identified as the Greenies (a mythical elf-like creature.) During the 1960s, considerations arose about the school colors in comparison to the mascot, the colors at the time being red and white. The HGS Booster Club decided that either the colors or the mascot must be replaced, so in 1965 Hazel Green School's mascot became the Trojan.\\"History of the Mascot\\". Planner. 2006-2007ed.

Cadoxton was once originally its own village, separate from Barry. It grew up around Saint Cadoc's parish church, which survives. It is also home to Cadoxton Primary School, situated opposite Victoria Park which in turn is opposite Crystal Springs Conservation Group. The Group was founded in 2005 and campaigned to save the field from housing. Cadoxton Nursery is located beside the primary school. The area is served by Cadoxton railway station  History  Over the years remains have been found that suggest Cadoxton, (under a different name), was once a Roman settlement of some description. Weston Square Bridge Cadoxton railway station The name 'Cadoxton' derives from the 6th century Saint, Cadoc, and the Old English word \\"ton\\" meaning settlement. The Welsh language name 'Tregatwg' is a direct translation, although the Welsh word is very rarely used by residents of Cadoxton or Barry. The ruins of a chapel dedicated to Cadoc's disciple, Saint Baruc, can still be seen in Friars Road. The village grew rapidly in the 19th and 20th centuries after the construction of Barry Docks in 1889. Cadoxton was swallowed up by Barry during this time.

Cadoxton is located just outside the town of Neath and borders the villages of Cilfrew and Bryncoch. The village has 1,684 residents and is located in the Cadoxton ward. Cadoxton elected a Liberal Democrat representative in the 2008 council elections.  History  The village name Cadoxton is the English language version of the Welsh name Llangatwg (equivalent to St Catwg's) and is a contraction of (Cadoc's-town). Both versions of the name derive from the parish church, located in the centre of the village, which is dedicated to St. Catwg. The village developed its fuller name, Cadoxton-juxta-Neath, in order to differentiate it from Cadoxton, Vale of Glamorgan (also known as Cadoxton-juxta-Barry).  Village character  The village consists of a main road of approximately running from the outskirts of the town of Neath to the village of Cilfrew, with smaller streets and housing estates feeding off. Cadoxton is home to two pubs, two newsagents and a park located in the centre of the village. Also in the village there is a community centre, a church hall, a garden centre, a funeral home and a guest house. Cadoxton was once home to a brewery, but this has now closed and new housing areas have been built up, seemingly closing the boundary between the village and the town of Neath. Housing in Cadoxton is mainly a mixture of relatively affluent estates consisting of detached housing, and smaller more traditional terraced accommodation. Crime is low in the village, and the area is generally considered to be one of the safest areas in the county. Children from the village normally attend Catwg Primary School and then Llangatwg Comprehensive School, both located in the village. The secondary school accommodates students from numerous other villages in the area, some located up to away. Also located in the village is Neath Golf Club, the course where past Ryder Cup player and captain Brian Huggett played as a junior.  The church  The fine church of St.Catwg'sParish of Cadoxton Juxta Neath - St.Catwg\`s is mentioned by famous \`Tramp Poet' W. H. Davies in his \\"Poet's Pilgrimage\\". Passing through Cadoxton, on his way to Aberdulais, Davies was overcome by his unexpected discovery in the churchyard of the large gravestone recording the \\"SAVAGE MURDER\\" of one Margaret Williams in 1822 and promising its unknown perpetrator a \\"TERRIBLE RIGHTEOUS JUDGEMENT\\" Davies, W.

Immediately to the east is the Sunken Forest, a park situated below mean high tide level. Point O' Woods is not a municipality and has no government as such. Like a few other Fire Island enclaves, it is a privately owned parcel of land. It is subject to the political jurisdiction of Brookhaven Township in Suffolk County; local law enforcement is the duty of Suffolk County Police Department's Marine Bureau.

This group still administers it today.\\"Paul Krassner Leads Fire Island Incursion\\", by Tony Ortega, The Village Voice, July 28, 2010 Today Point O' Woods serves as a summer vacation retreat for Association members and their families. Many members are from the East coast, but there are also members and guests from the West coast. The hamlet is opened by the Association in the mid-Spring, and closed in early autumn each year. As on much of Fire Island, cars are not permitted in Point O' Woods and bicycles are the principal means of wheeled transport. The community uses its private railroad, a half-mile long, narrow gaugeSmall Layout Scrapbook line to transport freight from the dock to key buildings in the town. It is not used for passenger service. In addition, the community operates a small fleet of motor vehicles to conduct maintenance, recycling and pest control. Privacy Essentially a village-sized private club, Point O' Woods is noted for its insularity and exclusivity. The land on which the cottages are built are technically owned by the Association, which offers long-term leases to the members who reside in them. Many members' families have summered there for generations. The hamlet is separated from its nearest western neighbor, Ocean Bay Park, by a six-foot chain-link barrier known simply as \\"the Fence\\". The Sunken Forest serves as a natural barrier to the east. Tourists are not welcome; the ferry from Bay Shore, L.I., is privately owned. Uninvited visitors who board may well be met by an Association member when they arrive at the Point O' Woods dock and directed to return to Bay Shore. Point O' Woods has its own church and volunteer fire department. It operated a post office until Nat Hentoff complained (described below). By its insularity and tight restrictions, Point O' Woods has avoided the kinds of commercial development and expansion that has affected the rest of Fire Island. It is still well known for its peaceful atmosphere, safe environment and its orientation towards family life. In spite of its storied exclusivity, Point O' Woods has established intramural relationships with summer camp sports programs with other Fire Island communities. The Volunteer Fire Department regularly trains with counterparts in Ocean Bay Park. Controversy A July 25, 1932 advertisement in Time magazine for Point O' Woods vacation info requests led to complaints of restricted lodging. In 1968, journalist Nat Hentoff, who was not a member of the community, protested because club rules denied him access to the federally funded U.S. post office located within the Point O' Woods grounds. Eventually, the hamlet resolved the dispute by giving up its federal post office; it now has no separate ZIP Code. Mail is delivered to the Bay Shore Post Office by the USPS and taken by ferry to Point O' Woods, where it is distributed privately. Wreck of the Elizabeth On July 19, 1850 the English barque Elizabeth sank after running aground on the Fire Island sandbar just off of Point O' Woods. Famed feminist author Margaret Fuller died in the wreck, along with her infant child. Three days after the sinking, Fuller's friend Henry David Thoreau arrived at Point O' Woods to search for her remains. Her body was never recovered.

He played thirteen seasons with eight clubs: the Chicago Orphans (1901), New York Giants (1902), Boston Beaneaters (1904‚Äì05), Cincinnati Reds (1906), St. Louis Browns (1907), Washington Senators (1907‚Äì09), Detroit Tigers (1909‚Äì12), and Brooklyn Tip-Tops (1914‚Äì15). Born in Cleveland, Ohio, he batted and threw right-handed. He was the fourth of six brothers, and all of them played professional baseball, with five of them appearing at the major-league level. After his baseball career, Delahanty moved back to Cleveland, where he lived until he died. Biography Delahanty was born to a Cleveland teamster into a family of six boys and two girls. Five of the Delahanty brothers became Major League Baseball players, including older brother Ed Delahanty, and the sixth brother played minor-league baseball. Though Jim was the fourth of the six brothers, he was the last brother to remain an active player in the major leagues. Beginning in 1896, Delahanty played minor-league baseball for several teams until the Chicago Orphans bought his contract in 1901. His introduction to the major leagues was brief, as Delahanty broke his patella after 17 games, ending his rookie season. After that season, Delahanty was traded to the New York Giants. He played briefly for the team, but he spent most of 1902 and all of 1903 back in the minor leagues. He hit .382 for the 1903 Little Rock Travelers. He played his first full season in 1904, in which he batted .285 with the Beaneaters. Boston traded Delahanty to the Cincinnati Reds in 1906 in exchange for Al Bridwell. In September 1906, the St. Louis Browns bought him from the Reds, and the next June, the Washington Senators purchased his contract from the Browns. He was traded mid-season by the Senators to the Tigers in 1909 for Germany Schaefer and played in his only World Series that season, batting .346 with 4 RBI in 7 games against the Pittsburgh Pirates. In 1911, Delahanty hit for his highest batting average (.339) and he had a career-high in runs batted in (94). He stayed in the major leagues until the middle of the 1912 season, having encountered illness and injuries that year that limited his productivity. He finished his playing career in the Federal League. In 1,186 career games, Delahanty had 1,159 hits with 19 home runs and 151 stolen bases. After his baseball career, Delahanty worked for the city of Cleveland as a street paver. He died in a Cleveland hospital in 1953 after a long illness. He was buried in Calvary Cemetery in Cleveland. He was survived by a wife, Hester, and a daughter.

Its goal is to investigate the processes that underlie human language learning by testing subjects' ability to learn a made- up grammar in a laboratory setting. It was developed to evaluate the processes of human language learning but has also been utilized to study implicit learning in a more general sense. The area of interest is typically the subjects' ability to detect patterns and statistical regularities during a training phase and then use their new knowledge of those patterns in a testing phase. The testing phase can either use the symbols or sounds used in the training phase or transfer the patterns to another set of symbols or sounds as surface structure. Many researchers propose that the rules of the artificial grammar are learned on an implicit level since the rules of the grammar are never explicitly presented to the participants. The paradigm has also recently been utilized for other areas of research such as language learning aptitude, structural priming and to investigate which brain structures are involved in syntax acquisition and implicit learning. Apart from humans, the paradigm has also been used to investigate pattern learning in other species, e.g. cottontop tamarins and starlings. History More than half a century ago George A. Miller established the paradigm of artificial grammar learning in order to investigate the influence of explicit grammar structures on human learning, he designed a grammar model of letters with different sequences. His research demonstrated that it was easier to remember a structured grammar sequence than a random sequence of letters. His explanation was that learners could identify the common characteristics between learned sequences and accordingly encode them to a memory set. He predicted that subjects could identify which letters will most likely appear together as a sequence repeatedly and which letters would not and that the subjects would use this information to form memory sets. Those memory sets served participants as a strategy later on during their memory tests. Reber doubted Miller's explanation. He claimed that if participants could encode the grammar rules as productive memory sets, then they should be able to verbalize their strategy in detail. He conducted research that led to the development of the modern AGL paradigm. This research used a synthetic grammar learning model to test implicit learning. AGL became the most used and tested model in the field. As in the original paradigm developed by Miller, participants were asked to memorize a list of letter strings which were created from an artificial grammar rule model. It was only during the test phase that participants were told that there was a set of rules behind the letter sequences they memorized. They were then instructed to categorize new letter strings based on the same set of rules which they had not previously been exposed to. They classified new letter strings as \\"grammatical\\" (constructed from the grammar rule), vs. \\"randomly constructed\\" sequences. If subjects correctly sorted the new strings above chance level, it could be inferred that subjects had acquired the grammatical rule structure without any explicit instruction of the rules. Reber found that participants sorted out new strings above chance level. While they reported using strategies during the sorting task, they could not actually verbalize those strategies. Subjects could identify which strings were grammatically correct but could not identify the rules that composed grammatical strings. This research was replicated and expanded upon by many others. The conclusions of most of these studies were congruent with Reber's hypothesis: the implicit learning process was done with no intentional learning strategies. These studies also identified common characteristics for the implicitly acquired knowledge: #Abstract representation for the set of rules. #Unconscious strategies that can be tested with performance.  The modern paradigm  The modern AGL paradigm can be used to investigate explicit and implicit learning, although it is most often used to test implicit learning. In a typical AGL experiment, participants are required to memorize strings of letters previously generated by a specific grammar. The length of the strings usually ranges from 2-9 letters per string. An example of such a grammar is shown in figure 1. center Figure 1: Example of an artificial grammar rule * Ruleful strings:VXVS, TPTXVS Unruleful strings:VXXXS, TPTPS In order to compose a grammatically \\"ruleful\\" string of letters, according to the predetermined grammar rule, a subject must follow the rules for the pairing of letters as represented in the model (figure 1). When observing a violation of the grammatical rule system that composes the string, it is considered an \\"unruleful\\" or randomly constructed string. In the case of a standard AGL implicit learning task, subjects are not told that the strings are based on a specific grammar. Instead, they are simply given the task to memorize the letter strings for a memory. After the learning phase, subjects are told that the letter strings presented during the learning phase were based on specific rules, but are not explicitly told what the rules are. During a test phase, the subjects are instructed to categorize new letter strings as \\"ruleful\\" or \\"unruleful\\". The dependent variable usually measured is the percentage of correctly categorized strings. Implicit learning is considered to be successful when the percentage of correctly sorted strings is significantly higher than chance level. If this significant difference is found, it indicates the existence of a learning process that is more involved than memorizing the presented letter strings. Bayesian learning The mechanism behind the implicit learning that is hypothesized to occur while people engage in artificial grammar learning is statistical learning or, more specifically, Bayesian learning. Bayesian learning takes into account types of biases or \\"prior probability distributions\\" individuals have that contribute to the outcome of implicit learning tasks. These biases can be thought of as a probability distribution that contains the probability that each possible hypothesis is likely to be correct. Due to the structure of the Bayesian model, the inferences output by the model are in the form of a probability distribution rather than a single most probable event. This output distribution is a \\"posterior probability distribution\\". The posterior probability of each hypothesis in the original distribution is the probability of the hypothesis being true given the data and the probability of data given the hypothesis is true. This Bayesian model for learning is fundamental for understanding the pattern detection process involved in implicit learning and, therefore, the mechanisms that underlie the acquisition of artificial grammar learning rules. It is hypothesized that the implicit learning of grammar involves predicting co-occurrences of certain words in a certain order. For example, \\"the dog chased the ball\\" is a sentence that can be learned as grammatically correct on an implicit level due to the high co-occurrence of \\"chase\\" being one of the words to follow \\"dog\\". A sentence like \\"the dog cat the ball\\" is implicitly recognized as grammatically incorrect due to the lack of utterances that contain those words paired in that specific order. This process is important for teasing apart thematic roles and parts of speech in grammatical processing (see grammar). While the labeling of the thematic roles and parts of speech is explicit, the identification of words and parts of speech is implicit. Explanatory models Traditional approaches to AGL claim that the stored knowledge obtained during the learning phase is abstract. Other approaches argue that this stored knowledge is concrete and consists of exemplars of strings encountered during the learning phase or \\"chunks\\" of these exemplars. In any case, it is assumed that the information stored in memory is retrieved in the test phase and is used to aid decisions about letter strings. Three main approaches attempt to explain the AGL phenomena: # Abstract Approach: According to this traditional approach, participants acquire an abstract representation of the artificial grammar rule in the learning stage. That abstract structure helps them to decide if the new string presented during the test phase is grammatical or randomly constructed. # Concrete knowledge approach: This approach proposes that during the learning stage participants learn specific examples of strings and store them in their memory. During the testing stage, participants do not sort the new strings according to an abstract rule; instead they will sort them according to their similarity to the examples stored in memory from the learning stage. There are multiple opinions concerning how concrete the learned knowledge really is. Brooks & Vokey argue that all of the knowledge stored in memory is represented as concrete examples of the full examples studied during the learning stage. The strings are sorted during the testing stage according to a full representation of the string examples from the learning stage. On the other hand, Perruchet & Pacteau claimed that the knowledge of the strings from the learning stage is stored in the form of \\"memory chunks\\" where 2 - 3 letters are learned as a sequence along with knowledge about their permitted location in the full string. # Dual Factor approach: Dual process learning model, combines the approaches described above. This approach proposes that a person will rely on concrete knowledge when they can. When they cannot rely on concrete knowledge (for example on a transfer of learning task), the person will use abstract knowledge of the rules. Research with amnesia patients suggests the \\"Dual Factor approach\\" may be the most accurate model. A series of experiments with amnesiac patients support the idea that AGL involves both abstract concepts and concrete exemplars. Amnesiacs were able to classify stimuli as \\"grammatical\\" vs. \\"randomly constructed\\" just as well as participants in the control group. While able to successfully complete the task, amnesiacs were not able to explicitly recall grammatical \\"chunks\\" of the letter sequence while the control group was able to explicitly recall them. When performing the task with the same grammar rules but a different sequence of letters than those that they were previously tested on, both amnesiacs and the control group were able to complete the task (although performance was better when the task was completed using the same set of letters used for training). The results of the experiment support the dual factor approach to artificial grammar learning in that people use abstract information to learn rules for grammars and use concrete, exemplar-specific memory for chunks. Since the amnesiacs were unable to store specific \\"chunks\\" in memory, they completed the task using an abstract set of rules. The control group was able to store these specific chunks in memory and (as evidenced by recall) did store these examples in memory for later reference. Automaticity debate AGL research has been criticized due to the \\"automatic question\\": Is AGL considered to be an automatic process? During encoding (see encoding (memory)), performance can be automatic in the sense of occurring without conscious monitoring (without conscious guidance by the performer's intentions). In the case of AGL, it was claimed that implicit learning is an automatic process due to the fact that it is done with no intention of learning a specific grammar rule. This complies with the classic definition of an \\"automatic process\\" as a fast, unconscious, effortless process that may start unintentionally. When aroused, it continues until it is over without the ability to stop or ignore its consequences. This definition has been challenged many times. Alternative definitions for automatic process have been given. Reber's presumption that AGL is automatic could be problematic by implying that an unintentional process is an automatic process in its essence. When focusing on AGL tests, a few issues need to be addressed. The process is complex and contains encoding and recall or retrieval. Both encoding and retrieval could be interpreted as automatic processes since what was encoded during the learning stage is not necessary for the task intentionally performed during the test stage. Researchers need to differentiate between implicitness as referring to the process of learning or knowledge encoding and also as referring to performance during the test phase or knowledge retrieval. Knowledge encoded during training may include many aspects of the presented stimuli (whole strings, relations among elements, etc.). The contribution of the various components to performance depends on both the specific instruction in the acquisition phase and the requirements of the retrieval task. Therefore, the instructions on every phase are important in order to determine whether or not each stage will require automatic processing. Each phase should be evaluated for automaticity separately. One hypothesis that contradicts the automaticity of AGL is the \\"mere exposure effect\\". The mere exposure effect is increased affect towards a stimulus that is the result of nonreinforced, repeated exposure to the stimulus. Results from over 200 experiments on this effect indicate that there is a positive relationship between mean \\"goodness\\" rating and frequency of stimulus exposure. Stimuli for these experiments included line drawings, polygons and nonsense words (which are types of stimuli used in AGL research). These experiments exposed participants to each stimulus up to 25 times. Following each exposure participants were asked to rate the degree to which each stimulus suggested \\"good\\" vs. \\"bad\\" effect on a 7-point scale. In addition to the main pattern of results, it was also found in several experiments that participants rated higher positive affect for previously exposed items than for novel items. Since implicit cognition should not reference previous study episodes, the effects on affect ratings should not have been observed if processing of this stimuli is truly implicit. The results of these experiments suggests that different categorization of the strings may occur due to differences in affect associated with the strings and not due to implicitly learned grammar rules. Artificial intelligence Since the advent of computers and artificial intelligence, computer programs have been adapted that attempt to simulate the implicit learning process observed in the AGL paradigm. The AI programs first adapted to simulate both natural and artificial grammar learning used the following basic structure: ;Given: A set of grammatical sentences from some language. ;Find: A procedure for recognizing and/or generating all grammatical sentences in that language. An early model for AI grammar learning is Wolff's SNPR System. The program acquires a series of letters with no pauses or punctuation between words and sentences. The program then examines the string in subsets and looks for common sequences of symbols and defines \\"chunks\\" in terms of these sequences (these chunks are akin to the exemplar-specific chunks described for AGL). As the model acquires these chunks through exposure, the chunks begin to replace the sequences of unbroken letters. When a chunk precedes or follows a common chunk, then the model determines disjunctive classes in terms of the first set. For example, when the model encounters \\"the-dog-chased\\" and \\"the-cat- chased\\" it classifies \\"dog\\" and \\"cat\\" as being members of the same class since they both precede \\"chase\\". While the model sorts chunks into classes, it does explicitly define these groups (e.g., noun, verb). Early AI models of grammar learning such as these ignored the importance of negative instances of grammar's effect on grammar acquisition and were also lacking in the ability to connect grammatical rules to pragmatics and semantics. Newer models have attempted to factor these details in. The Unified Model attempts to take both of these factors into account. The model breaks down grammar according to \\"cues\\". Languages mark case roles using five possible cue types: word order, case marking, agreement, intonation and verb-based expectation (see grammar). The influence that each cue has over a language's grammar is determined by its \\"cue strength\\" and \\"cue validity\\". Both of these values are determined using the same formula, except that cue strength is defined through experimental results and cue validity is defined through corpus counts from language databases. The formula for cue strength/validity is as follows: : Cue strength/cue validity = cue availability * cue reliability Cue availability is the proportion of times that the cue is available over the times that it is needed. Cue reliability is the proportion of times that the cue is correct over the total occurrences of the cue. By incorporating cue reliability along with cue availability, The Unified Model is able to account for the effects of negative instances of grammar since it takes accuracy and not just frequency into account. As a result, this also accounts for the semantic and pragmatic information since cues that do not produce grammar in the appropriate context will have low cue strength and cue validity. While MacWhinney's model also simulates natural grammar learning, it attempts to model the implicit learning processes observed in the AGL paradigm. Cognitive neuroscience and the AGL paradigm Contemporary studies with AGL have attempted to identify which structures are involved in the acquisition of grammar and implicit learning. Agrammatic aphasic patients (see Agrammatism) were tested with the AGL paradigm. The results show that breakdown of language in agrammatic aphasia is associated with an impairment in artificial grammar learning, indicating damage to domain-general neural mechanisms sub serving both language and sequential learning. De Vries, Barth, Maiworm, Knecht, Zwitserlood & Fl√∂el found that electrical stimulation of Broca's area enhances implicit learning of an artificial grammar. Direct current stimulation may facilitate acquisition of grammatical knowledge, a finding of potential interest for rehabilitation of aphasia. Petersson, Vasiliki & Hagoort, examine the neurobiological correlates of syntax, the processing of structured sequences, by comparing fMRI results on artificial and natural language syntax. They argue that the \\"Chomsky hierarchy\\" is not directly relevant for neurobiological systems through AGL testing.

She began stage two on 24 May 2009, with intentions to arrive at the island nation of Tuvalu 2580 miles away. On 28 August, after suffering adverse winds and currents for several days, with food supplies running low and her water-maker broken, Savage realised that she was unlikely to be able to reach Tuvalu and reluctantly changed course for Tarawa. She arrived in Tarawa on 5 September after 104 days at sea and approximately 1.3 million oar strokes.http://www.fox8.com/news/nationworld/sns-ap-as- australia-pacific-rower,0,5689487.story Savage began her third and final stage for the Pacific Row on 18 April 2010 with the intention to row to the eastern shore of Australia. After mid ocean currents gave her a more westerly course, she again changed her destination and arrived at Papua New Guinea on 8 May 2010.http://rozsavage.com/2010/05/08/day-20-no-ditheration She reported by Twitter on 3, 1 June:35pm (UTC) that she arrived at Madang, Papua New Guinea after 45 days at sea. The Indian In April 2011, Savage set out to row across the Indian Ocean, launching from Fremantle, Australia. Her route, daily locations and destination were kept secret because of the danger from pirates. She was towed back to Australia a fortnight into the 4000 mile voyage due to a fault with the desalination machine the rowing boat was equipped with. Roz Savage successfully completed her Indian Ocean crossing on 4 October 2011, becoming the first woman to solo row the \\"Big Three,\\" the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans. The crossing took 154 days. North Atlantic In March 2012, Savage announcedRoz Savage's Blog of 2 March 2012 that she would row that North Atlantic as part of the Olympic Atlantic Row (OAR) team with Andrew Morris. The goal was to row from St John's in Canada to the UK, making landfall in Bristol and then rowing through the inland waterways to London, arriving in time for the Olympics. This row was postponed indefinitely in May 2012 due to unusually large numbers of icebergs drifting past the coast of Newfoundland, the result of a huge chunk of ice breaking off a glacier in Greenland in 2010. The situation was deemed to represent an unacceptable level of risk to the safety of the rowers.Roz Savage's Blog of 20 May 2012 Ocean Rowing Race Support In 2012, Savage joined Chris Martin (rower) and the team at New Ocean Wave as Race Consultant to the Great Pacific Race from Monterey, California to Honolulu, Hawaii starting in June 2014.

Biography Arthur was the son of Sir Charles William Bell and Louisa Maria Dawes. He was educated at Eton and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, and was commissioned in the Scots Guards in 1890. He served in the Boer War. In 1905, his father was created a Baronet. That same year the family assumed by Royal licence the additional surname and arms of Morrison in 1905, for Charles' mother, Mary Wilhelmina Morrison, the daughter and heiress of Royal Navy officer John Morrison. Arthur was promoted Major in 1908, and retired from the army the same year. At the general election of January 1910, Morrison-Bell was elected Member of Parliament (MP) for Honiton. In 1914, he rejoined the army at the beginning of the First World War, was captured in 1915 and returned to England in 1918. Morrison-Bell held the seat without a break until 1931, when he retired due to ill-health. He was created a baronet in the 1923 Birthday Honours. Personal life In 1912 Morrison- Bell married Hon. Lilah Katherine Julia Wingfield, daughter of Mervyn Wingfield, 7th Viscount Powerscourt. They had two daughters, Shelagh and Patricia, with a third daughter dying in infancy. Shelagh married Sir Ralph Abercromby Campbell, Chief Justice of the Bahamas, in 1968. The baronetcy became extinct when he died in 1956.

It is part of Gettysburg Battlefield Historic District, and is surrounded by Gettysburg National Military Park and Soldiers' National Cemetery. The cemetery played a strategic role in the July 1 to 3, 1863 Battle of Gettysburg. Four months after the battle, at the dedication of the immediately-adjacent National Cemetery, President Abraham Lincoln delivered his \\"Gettysburg Address\\" from a platform in Evergreen Cemetery. History=Founding The Ever Green Cemetery Association of Gettysburg was established at a November 29, 1853 meeting. The association managed the property and oversaw selection of its caretakers. By April 3, 1854, 118 lots had been sold, and the association members' first payments were due. The first interment took place on October 29. Opening ceremonies were held on November 7, 1854, and in his dedication address Reverend John H. C. Dosh asked, \\"Could a more lovely spot have been chosen?\\"Alfred L. Brophy, \\"The Road to the Gettysburg Address,\\" Florida State University Law Review 43 (2016):831. The Evergreen Cemetery gatehouse was designed by Philadelphia architect Stephen Decatur Button, built by local contractors George and Henry Chritzman, and completed in November 1855. The Italianate gatehouse served as the caretaker residence. Battle of Gettysburg Battle of East Cemetery Hill, July 2, 1863 Evergreen Cemetery is eponymous with Cemetery Hill, the landform noted as the keystone of the Union position during the Battle of Gettysburg. Major- General Oliver Otis Howard lined the cemetery's high ground with cannons, turning it into an \\"artillery platform,\\" and made its gatehouse into XI Corps (Union Army) headquarters. At dusk on July 2, 5 Louisiana regiments under Brigadier-General Harry T. Hays and 3 North Carolina regiments under Colonel Isaac E. Avery commenced the Battle of East Cemetery Hill, charging Howard's artillery batteries from the east. \\"Federal soldiers in the Cemetery laid many of the tombstones on the ground\\" to limit damage, and some of the XI Corps batteries and infantry used the grave monuments \\"for shelter from the enemy's fire\\". Historian Frederick Hawthorne wrote of Howard's successful defense: ‚ÄúLying in reserve in the Evergreen Cemetery, they (73rd Pennsylvania Infantry) rushed out through the cemetery gateway to help drive the Confederates away from Rickett‚Äôs and Weidrich‚Äôs batteries.‚ÄùHawthorne, Frederick W., Gettysburg: Stories of Men and Monuments, Hanover, Pennsylvania: The Association of Licensed Battlefield Guides, 1988, p. 107. Evergreen experienced three days as battlefield, and its resulting condition inspired a Union officer to lament: \\"A beautiful cemetery it was, but now is trodden down, laid a waste, desecrated. The fences are all down, the many graves have been run over, beautiful lots with iron fences and splendid monuments have been destroyed or soiled, and our infantry and artillery occupy those sacred grounds where the dead are sleeping. It is enough to make one mourn.\\" Two Confederate soldiers mortally wounded during the battle were buried in Evergreen Cemetery. Post- battle Detail of a 1904 map showing the National Cemetery (semi-circles right of center) and Evergreen Cemetery (right) The Consecration of the National Cemetery at Gettysburg took place on November 19, 1863. The speaker's platform used by orator Edward Everett, and then by President Abraham Lincoln to deliver his Gettysburg Address, was located just east of the National Cemetery, on the grounds of Evergreen Cemetery. From 1893 to 1916, the Gettysburg Electric Railway operated along the cemetery's east and south borders. Following the 1917 demolition of the trolley railway, Evergreen Cemetery expanded southward. In 1972, the \\"Evergreen Cemetery archway house\\" was designated an historic district contributing structure by the Gettysburg Borough Council (1 of 38 outside of the borough). Civilian remains at the site of the 1804 Associate Reformed Presbyterian Church cemetery were reinterred at Evergreen Cemetery in 1992.

It is of theoretical interest as one of the simplest non-benzenoid conjugated hydrocarbons. Fulvalene is an unstable isomer of the more common benzenoid aromatic compounds naphthalene and azulene. Fulvalene consists of two 5-membered rings, each with two double bonds, joined by yet a fifth double bond. It has D2h symmetry. Biferrocene is a complex of the fulvalene dianion.  History  An earlier attempt at synthesis of fulvalene in 1951 by Pauson and Kealy resulted in the accidental discovery of ferrocene. Its synthesis was first reported in 1958 by E. A. Matzner, working under William von Eggers Doering.Dissertation Abstracts Int'l 26-06 page 3270 6411876. In this method, cyclopentadienyl anion is coupled with iodine to the dihydrofulvalene. Double deprotonation of dihydrofulvalene with n-butyllithium gives the dilithio derivative, which oxidizes with oxygen. Fulvalene was spectroscopically observed at 77 K from photolysis of diazocyclopentadiene, which induces dimerization of cyclopentadiene-derived carbenes. The compound was isolated in 1986. It was found to be nonaromatic. Above ‚àí50 ¬∞C it dimerizes by a Diels-Alder reaction.  Derivatives  Perchlorofulvalene (C4Cl4C)2 is quite stable in contrast to fulvalene itself.

Biography Destiny's Toy (1916) Huff was supposedly a relative of former President James Knox Polk. She began her acting career at the age of 15 and toured in stage productions of Ben-Hur and Graustark. She made her motion picture debut in 1913 with In the Bishop's Carriage and Caprice. Louise joined Lubin Studios in 1913 where she worked with actor and director Edgar Jones. She married Jones in 1914 and they had a daughter, Mary Louise in 1915. In 1916 she secured the ingenue role opposite Jack Pickford in the Booth Tarkington comedy Seventeen. Huff was featured in motion pictures produced by Famous Players-Lasky and Paramount Pictures, and continued in films until 1922. Her later silent films included roles in Great Expectations (1917), Mile-a-Minute Kendall (1918), Oh, You Women! (1919), Disraeli (1921) and her final film, The Seventh Day (1922). A biography by Hans J. Wollstein states: :A stage ingenue of some importance who had appeared in the original Broadway version of Ben Hur, brunette Louise Huff became a star with the pioneer Lubin Mfg. Company of Philadelphia. In scores of one- and two-reel melodramas and Westerns from the very early 1910s, Huff was especially popular in tandem with Edgar Jones, whom she married. Together, they relocated to California in the mid-1910s but her career was already on the wane and she retired in 1922. Her sister, Justina Huff, was also a Lubin star. However, Wollstein erred in claiming that Louise appeared on Broadway with Ben Hur. It was actually a touring version of the play that appeared across the country. She did however play on Broadway after her screen career ended. She appeared in the Broadway productions of Mary the Third (1923) and The New Englander (1924).Daniel Bellware, \\"Those Huff Girls,\\" Muscogiana, Columbus State University, Columbus, GA, Fall 2016, p. 45 Her fame was international as evidenced by memorabilia from a variety of countries, including a novelization of her film The Crook of Dreams from France and tobacco trading cards from Canada and the U.K. Her film The Seventh Day was considered lost until a copy turned up in a Czechoslovakian film archive. She married Edwin A. Stillman in 1920 and had two more children, William and Nancy. Stillman was president of Watson-Stillman, manufacturers of hydraulic machinery.

At one point, it was the largest such group in the world, with regular user group meetings, many publications, permanent offices in Boston, and hosting major product announcements, including the East Coast release of the Apple Macintosh in 1984.  History  The organization was co-founded by thirteen-year-old Jonathan Rotenberg in 1977, and grew to become the largest such organization in the world, with over 30,000 members in all 50 U.S. states and 40 other countries. The other co-founder was Richard Gardner. Among the early members were many well-known names in the computer industry, including Stewart Alsop II, Daniel S. Bricklin, Philip D. Estridge, Dan Fylstra, William H. Gates, Wayne Green, Mitchell Kapor, Cary Lu, Mike Markkula, Seymour Papert, Jon Shirley, Clive Sinclair, Benjamin M. Rosen, and Nigel Searle. At its peak in the early 1990s, BCS supported more than 75 different user and special interest groups and held more than 150 monthly meetings. Apple Computer Corp., Lotus Software and IBM made major product announcements at BCS meetings.

It was the first bank of India and was renamed Bank of Bengal on 2 January 1809. The bank opened branches at Rangoon (1861), Patna (1862), Mirzapur (1862), and Benares (1862).

Among the bank's renowned customers were, scholar and politician Dadabhai Naoroji, scientist Jagadish Chandra Bose, India‚Äôs first President Rajendra Prasad, Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore and educationist Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar.

History = Founding  In 1978, A. Billy S. Jones, Darlene Garner, and Delores P. Berry organized the National Coalition of Black Gays (NCBG) in Columbia, Maryland, to provide a national advocacy forum for African American gay men and lesbians at a time when no other organization existed to express their views. The organizers, also including Louis Hughes, Gil Gerald, Rev. Renee McCoy, and John Gee, were motivated by a belief that existing gay and lesbian organizations did not represent the views and experiences of African Americans. In 1984, NCBG added Lesbian to its name in the 1980s to become the National Coalition of Black Lesbians and Gays. The organization's headquarters moved to Detroit, Michigan briefly in the mid-1980s.  Operation  NCBLG chapters existed in cities such as Philadelphia, New York, Norfolk, Minneapolis, New Orleans, Atlanta, Chicago, Portland, St. Louis, San Francisco, Washington D.C., Boston, Richmond, and others. The organization operated to highlight the concerns of the black LGBT community, provide previously nonexistent spaces for the community and its allies, and promote the artistic endeavors of its members, often coordinating social events and fundraisers to propel the collective forward.  Dissolution  NCBG added Lesbian to its name in 1984 to become the National Coalition of Black Lesbians and Gays, but by 1986, several key leaders left the organization, and eventually the group (without any official announcement) faded out of existence.\\"NCBLG: Making History\\", p.2, by Sidney Brinkley; at Blacklight Online, accessed 25 July 2010 By 1990, formal operations ended for the organization. As founding member A. Billy S. Jones described, \\"We just faded away. Some board members refused to acknowledge that it was time to say good-bye but folks just burned out and faded away.\\"  Advocacy  The organization was noted for its advocacy of LGBT parental rights, and Jones specifically organized groups to support gay and lesbian parents in Washington D.C. NCBLG was one of the first organizations to initiate HIV/AIDS prevention efforts in the black community, including pamphlets that used coded terms familiar in the black community with men who would never identify with the gay community.Gilberto R. Gerald, The Down Low: New jargon, sensationalism, or agent of change?, March 26, 2007 In addition, it sponsored two National Third World Lesbian and Gay Conferences and published a news magazine, Black/Out, which offered funding and support for the organization.  National Third World Lesbian and Gay Conference  The first National Third World Lesbian and Gay Conference took place in Washington D.C in 1979. The event took place in conjunction with the 1979 national March on Washington, and spurred more black LGBT people in the community to organize. The creation of Howard University's Lambda Student Alliance, the first openly LGBT organization at an HBCU, is one example of the event's influence. LGBT people of color from the United States, Mexico, Canada, and the Caribbean participated in the conference. It garnered more attendees than the second conference, held two years later in Chicago, although the 1981 conference was noted for its more diverse participants. The second conference's theme was, \\"A United Rainbow of Strength.\\"  Black/Out  Black/Out was a quarterly magazine first published by NCBLG in 1986 that offered funding and support for the organization. With Joseph Beam as its editor, the magazine considered itself to be \\"the voice of a new movement of Black Lesbians and Gays\\" and a \\"revolutionary publication\\" in the face of discrimination. It primarily focused on highlighting the erasure of black people from LGBT spaces, as well as offering discourse for race and sexual identity. The newsletter Habari-Habari predicated Black/Out as a bimonthly publication beginning in 1980.  Notable members  * Michelle Parkerson * Joseph F.

Conducting career  In 1938, at age 22, he became conductor of the Oklahoma City Symphony Orchestra, an organization that he led from a WPA project to an accomplished ensemble with broad civic support. When Max Reiter, conductor of the San Antonio Symphony Orchestra, died in December 1950, Alessandro took over much of the remaining season; he signed a contract as permanent conductor in April 1951. The next year he also assumed leadership of the San Antonio Symphony Society's Grand Opera Festival. Alessandro was at his best in works by Tchaikovsky, Wagner and Richard Strauss. He was a sympathetic interpreter of Johannes Brahms and the odd- numbered symphonies of Ludwig van Beethoven. He introduced works by Anton Bruckner, Gustav Mahler, and Alban Berg to San Antonio audiences before they became fashionable elsewhere. He conducted memorable performances of Elektra, Salome, Nabucco, Boris Godunov, Susannah, Die Meistersinger, and the standard operas of Giuseppe Verdi and Giacomo Puccini. In building the San Antonio orchestra he was an exacting, often irascible taskmaster of high musical standards. But he was capable of less formidable moments as well; in February 1962, for instance, he dedicated a performance of Ein Heldenleben to the memory of Bruno Walter.  Growing up  He was born in Waco, Texas, on November 27, 1915. His father, Victor Alessandro (1883‚Äì1971) was a prominent conductor and music teacher in public schools. The Alessandros moved to Houston in 1919. Victor was introduced to music at an early age and studied French horn with his father. He made his conducting debut at age four, when he led a children's band in a performance of Victor Herbert's March of the Toys.  Higher education  In 1932, he entered the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, New York, where he studied composition with Howard Hanson. He then studied at the Salzburg Mozarteum and the St. Cecilia Academy in Rome, where he studied with Ildebrando Pizzetti.  Honors  Alessandro received three honorary doctorates: * Eastman School of Music, University of Rochester, 1948 (as of 1964, Alessandro was the only graduate of Eastman an honorary Ph.D. degree in music conferred on him by the University of Rochester)The Musical Leader, Volumes 96-97 (1964) * Southwestern University, Georgetown, Texas, May 1975Graduation Convocation Set at SMU, The Dallas Morning News, May 27, 1956 * Doctor of Humanities, Southern Methodist University, May 1956SMU Professor to Get Degree, The Dallas Morning News, May 1, 1975 In 1956, he received the Alice M. Ditson Award for service to American music.  Selected discography  Recordings of his work include Claude Debussy's Martyrdom of St. Sebastian (1950), light accompaniments (ca. 1953), Antonio Vivaldi and Rodrigo guitar concertos and works by Richard Strauss and John Corigliano (1967‚Äì68).  Family  In 1956, he married flutist Ruth Drisko (1926‚Äì1996). They had two children, Victor Tabbut Alessandro (born 1958) and Ruth Ann Alessandro (1959‚Äì1992). With his health declining, Alessandro retired in 1976. He died in San Antonio on November 27, 1976, his sixty-first birthday.

Three of the creations are extant as of 2010. The Leslie Baronetcy, of Wardis and Findrassie in the County of Moray, was created in the Baronetage of Nova Scotia on 1 September 1625 for John Leslie, with remainder to his heirs male whatsoever. He was a descendant of the Leslies of Balquhain, from whom the Leslie Counts of the Holy Roman Empire are also descended (see Clan Leslie). On the death of the second Baronet in 1645, the title reverted to his uncle, William Leslie. However, he declined to assume the title as he would not also inherit the Wardis estate. His four sons all died childless. The title was assumed in circa 1800 by John Leslie, the fourth Baronet. He was a descendant of Norman Leslie, younger brother of the third Baronet. The presumed tenth Baronet has not successfully proven his succession and is not on the Official Roll of the Baronetage. For more information, follow this link. See also the Leslie Baronets of Glaslough below. The Leslie, later Pepys Baronetcy, of Juniper Hill in the County of Surrey, was created in the Baronetage of Great Britain on 22 January 1784. For more information on this creation, see Earl of Cottenham. The Leslie Baronetcy, of Tarbert in the County of Kerry, was created in the Baronetage of Ireland on 3 September 1787 for Edward Leslie. The title became extinct on his death in 1818. The Leslie Baronetcy, of Glaslough in the County of Monaghan, was created in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom on 21 February 1876 for John Leslie, Conservative Member of Parliament for Monaghan. He was a descendant of John Leslie, Bishop of Clogher, son of George Leslie of Crichie, second son of Walter Leslie of Wardis and uncle of the first Baronet of the 1625 creation (see above). The third Baronet was a diplomat and writer. Lionel Alister David Leslie (1900‚Äì1987), fourth son of the second Baronet, was a sculptor, author and explorer. Desmond Leslie, younger son of the third Baronet, was a film maker, writer and musician. Anita Leslie, daughter of the third Baronet, was a writer (her works include Lady Randolph Churchill: The Story of Jennie Jerome).

It is the largest trading body in the WTO, and it was formed as an umbrella body including the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group (ACP), the African Union, and the group of Least Developed Countries (LDC). Objectives The driving force for the formation of the G90 was the lack of economic power faced by poor and small nations to enact resolutions in trade disputes, as envisioned by the WTO. G90 nations, unable to enforce or afford countervailing measures, or compete with the subsidized economies of wealthier nations, formed the trade block in order to ensure a collective voice on issues of importance to landlocked and island economies, less developed countries, and commodity- dependent nations. Primarily, they want preferential domestic subsidies by the European Union and the United States to be removed in order to allow G90 products greater access to foreign markets. Together with the G20 and the G33, the G90 aims to counterbalance the power of the United States and European economies in directing global trade, particularly with respect to negotiations over agricultural goods, upon which most of the G90 economies depend.

He studied philosophy at Vilnius University (then called Vilnius Academy). He also studied mathematics, physics and theology. He went on to lecture on those subjects at several European universities: in Florence, Prague, Olomouc, Wroc≈Çaw, Mainz and W√ºrzburg. In 1680 he accepted an offer from John III Sobieski, the king of Poland, returning to Poland and taking the position of the king's chaplain, mathematician, clock maker, librarian, and tutor of the king's son, Jakub. He wrote many scientific papers, mainly on mathematics and mechanics, but also on physics, astronomy and philosophy. The best known of his works, Observationes Cyclometricae ad facilitandam Praxin accommodatae, is devoted to the squaring the circle (or alternatively, the quadrature of the circle) and was published in 1685 in the leading scientific periodical of the time, Acta Eruditorum.

With it is the sixth largest island of Italy by area. The approximately 6,000 inhabitants are mostly concentrated in the fishing town of Carloforte, the only comune in the island. It is included in the province of South Sardinia. It is named after Saint Peter. The island is connected by regular ferry service to Portovesme and Calasetta. Geography The island is of volcanic origin. The rocks are of Cenozoic age, and include basalt, dacite and rhyolite (including the peralkaline variety comendite).Cioni, R. and Funedda, A., (2005)Structural geology of crystal-rich, silicic lava flows:A case study from San Pietro Island (Sardinia, Italy) in Manga, M. and Ventura, G.

The of its coasts are mostly rocky; the western and northern part includes some natural grottoes, unprotected landings, with a few small beaches, in general here the coast is usually very steep, rocky. The eastern coast, on which the port of Carloforte lies, is more protected low and sandy. Small beach in South side of San Pietro isle Off the north-western coast are two small islands, the Isola dei Ratti and Isola Piana. The latter includes the remains of one of the largest tonnara in Italy, now turned into a tourist resort. The island has no rivers or streams, but features numerous ponds and marshes. The interior is hilly, the highest points being the Bricco (hill) Guardia dei Mori () and Bricco Tortoriso (208 m). The vegetation is that typical of the Mediterranean coast, with Cistus, mastic, strawberry tree, juniper, Aleppo pine and holm oak. Here groves of oak and pine with clearings that are often cultivated, and populated with scattered houses. Cultivation, held especially in the eastern and more protected region, includes grape (Vitis vinifera), fig and Indian fig. The western part exposed to the prevailing wind, the mistral, is more arid, with low scrub vegetation and largely uninhabited. The climate is temperate-hot. The island is connected to the Sardinia, and to the next island of Sant'Antioco by two ferry lines. History Capo Sandalo, on the west of San Pietro Island The island has been known since ancient times. The Phoenicians called it Enosim or Inosim, while for the Greek it was Hieracon Nesos and for the Romans Accipitrum Insula (Sparrowhawk Island). The latter is derived from the presence of the small Eleonora's falcon, which is still present on the island. San Pietro is home today to remains from the Phoenician, Roman and Sardinian civilizations. According to a legend, the island is so named because St. Peter visited the island in 46 AD. In 1739 century the then-uninhabited San Pietro was colonized by people of Ligurian language and ethnicity. They had fled the Republic of Genoa's colony on the small Tunisian island of Tabarka, established in 1542 for the purpose of coral fishing, after it had been taken over by the Bey of Tunisia. Today most of the population has retained a variant of the Genoese dialect, called Tabarchino, which is also spoken in Calasetta, in the northern part of the neighboring Sant'Antioco island, whose residents are of the same origin. The island is twinned with the Spanish island of Tabarca, which was likewise settled by former residents of the Tabarkan colony. The town of Carloforte (Fort Charles) on the Island of San Pietro was dedicated to Charles Emmanuel III of Sardinia, who had granted the island to the Tabarkan refugees.

In all variations, these are arm balancing poses in which hands are planted on the floor, shins rest upon upper arms, and feet lift up. The poses are often confused, but traditionally Kakasana has arms bent, Bakasana (the crane being the taller bird with longer legs) has the arms straight.  Etymology and origins The names for the asanas come from the Sanskrit words ‡§¨‡§ï baka (\\"crane\\") or ‡§ï‡§æ‡§ï kƒÅka (\\"crow\\"), and ‡§Ü‡§∏‡§® ƒÅsana meaning \\"posture\\" or \\"seat\\". While different yoga lineages use one name or another for the asanas, Dharma Mittra makes a distinction, citing Kakasana as being with arms bent (like the shorter legs of a crow) and Bakasana with arms straight (like the longer legs of a crane). B. K. S. Iyengar's 1966 Light on Yoga describes only Bakasana, with straight arms. In Sivananda Yoga, Swami Vishnudevananda's 1960 Complete Illustrated Book of Yoga describes only Kakasana, with bent arms. However, practitioners in the west often mistranslate the Sanskrit \\"Bakasana\\" as \\"Crow Pose\\". These balancing poses can be dated at least to the 17th century Hatha Ratnavali, where Bakasana is number 62 of the 84 poses said to have been taught by Shiva. The 19th century Sritattvanidhi describes and illustrates both Kakasana and Bakasana. In his 1969 book Asana Pranayama Mudra Bandha, Swami Satyananda Saraswati of the Bihar School of Yoga uses the name Bakasana for a different pose entirely, standing on one leg, the body angled down with the other leg straight out in line with the body, the arms straight and grasping the standing big toe.  Description  Kakasana, Crow Pose, with bent arms These asanas are arm balances. According to B.K.S. Iyengar there are two techniques for entering them. The simple method is by pushing up from a crouching position. The advanced method is to drop down from Shirshasana (yoga headstand).  Variations  Asymmetric variations include: * Parsva Bakasana (Side Crane Pose) in which one thigh rests on the opposite upper arm and the other leg is stacked on top of the first * Eka Pada Bakasana/Kakasana (One-Legged Crane/Crow Pose respectively) in which one leg remains in Bakasana while the other extends straight back.  Follow-up asanas  Crane/Crow is often followed by Chaturanga Dandasana (Four-Limbed Staff Pose) or Salamba Sirsasana II (Supported Head Stand, Second version). Some practitioners jump in and out of Crane/Crow via Adho Mukha Svanasana (Downward-Facing Dog Pose). Claims Twentieth century advocates of some schools of yoga, such as B. K. S. Iyengar, made claims for the effects of yoga on specific organs, without adducing any evidence. Iyengar claimed that this pose \\"strengthens the arms and abdominal organs since the latter are contracted.\\"  See also  * Bhujapidasana ‚Äì a similar hand-balancing pose, with the feet crossed in front of the body * Tittibhasana - a hand-balancing pose with the feet stretched straight out in front  References Sources : : : Balancing asanas Medieval Hatha Yoga asanas Core strength asanas ","title":"Bakasana"},{"id":"6353026","text":"National University of Health Sciences (NUHS) is a private university in Lombard, Illinois that focuses on the health sciences. The university offers professional degrees in chiropractic and naturopathic medicine, master's degrees in acupuncture and Oriental medicine, a bachelor's degree in biomedical science, and a certificate or associate degree in massage therapy. History National University of Health Sciences was founded as the \\"National School of Chiropractic\\" by John Fitz Allen Howard in 1906 in Davenport, Iowa. In 1908, the school moved to Chicago, because its founder desired a scientifically more rigorous academic culture. Another reason that Howard relocated to the Chicago area was that he received an agreement allowing his students to have access to anatomical study of cadavers at the nearby Cook County Hospital. After being chartered and incorporated by the State of Illinois, the college's first home was on Congress Street across from Presbyterian Hospital. In 1920, the college's enrollment had grown to such an extent that it needed a larger facility, so it purchased a five-story building at 20 N. Ashland and the name was changed to \\"The National College of Chiropractic\\". In 1927, the college established its first clinic, the \\"Chicago General Health Service\\", which remained in operation until 2008. In 1942, the college became a not-for-profit educational and research institution under the corporate laws of Illinois and the United States Department of the Treasury governing tax-exempt institutions. In 1963, National relocated its campus to Lombard, Illinois in suburban Chicago where it remains today. In 1968, the Chiropractic Institute of New York was merged into National. In 2000, it adopted the university structure and changed its name to National University of Health Sciences. In 2009, the university entered into a partnership with St. Petersburg College, a public community college in St. Petersburg, Florida, to provide a doctor of chiropractic degree at the St. Petersburg College campus. The university currently operates six of its own clinics (four in Illinois, two in Florida), as well as two clinics housed by a not-for-profit outside mission organization serving transient clients. Publications The National University of Health Sciences publishes three scientific journals for the chiropractic profession: #Journal of Manipulative and Physiological Therapeutics Selected as the official research publication of the American Chiropractic Association, JMPT is the first and only refereed, internationally and Medline indexed biomedical journal in the chiropractic profession. #Journal of Chiropractic Medicine Published quarterly, this peer-reviewed indexed journal meets the modern-day chiropractic physician's need for practical and cutting-edge information with concrete clinical applications. It provides a forum for information on the primary care emphasis within the chiropractic profession. #Journal of Chiropractic Humanities A peer-reviewed indexed journal with the primary purpose of fostering scholarly debate and interaction within the chiropractic profession regarding the humanities. The journal's objective is to create legitimate dialogue in a field where a diversity of opinion exists, and provide a professional forum for interaction on these views.

According to the 2003 Citizen Survey of the City of Highland Park, however, 26,433 (88%) of the residents made use of library services. History At the July 7, 1887 meeting of the City Council, a number of citizens presented a petition requesting that the council establish and maintain a public library and on September 14, 1887 the Highland Park City Council adopted an ordinance for the establishment of a tax-supported public library and appropriated $260 annually for its maintenance. Books began circulating from the library on April 7, 1888. In 1903 a commission from the Highland Park Woman's Club contacted Mr. Andrew Carnegie for a financial donation to construct a new library. Mr. Carnegie was willing to donate $10,000 for the construction of a library building in Highland Park, provided that the city owned the site. Mr. Arthur C. Thomson, of Brookline, Massachusetts offered to give the city a piece of property upon which to locate the new library. The lot that he gave to the library was located on Laurel Ave. one block south of Central Street, and just east of St. Johns Ave. By 1927 it was evident to the Board that the Carnegie library was inadequate and that only an entirely new library would do. The population of Highland Park, just 4,209 in 1910, had grown to approximately 10,000. The City Council proposed a levy increase spread over 7 years to raise the estimated $150,000 to build the new library. The Chicago architectural firm of Holmes and Flinn (Morris Grant Holmes and Raymond W. Flinn) designed the original modified Gothic style structure built of Wisconsin limestone with Indiana limestone trim. The new library was dedicated on Sept. 20, 1931. In 1960, the Library Board decided to build an addition on the west side of the existing library. Bertram Weber was hired to design what is now known as the Children's Wing in the same modified Gothic style of the original building and in 1976 a modern adult wing (20,000 sq. ft.) designed by the firm Wendt, Cedarholm & Tippens was added to the south of the original building.

Missile and Space Projects Guide 1962, Springer, 1962, p. 224. History In the post-World War II period, Radioplane followed up the success of the OQ-2 target drone with another very successful series of piston-powered target drones, what would become known as the Basic Training Target (BTT) family (the BTT designation wasn't created until the 1980s, but is used here as a convenient way to resolve the tangle of designations). The BTTs remained in service for the rest of the 20th century. Variants=OQ-19 / KD2R Original OQ-19 on display at Aviation Unmanned Vehicle Museum Communications hardware for the BTT on display at the Aviation Unmanned Vehicle Museum The BTT family began life in the late 1940s, evolving through a series of refinements with the US Army designations of OQ-19A through OQ-19D, and the US Navy name of Quail with designated KD2R. Early models had a metal fuselage and wooden wings, but production standardized on an all-metal aircraft. Radioplane developed an experimental XQ-10 variant that was mostly made of plastic, but although evaluations went well, it wasn't considered a major improvement over existing technology, and it did not go into production. Radioplane was bought out by Northrop in 1952 to become the Northrop Ventura Division, though it appears that the \\"Radioplane\\" name lingered on for a while. MQM-33 / MQM-36 In 1963, when the US military adopted a standardized designation system, the surviving US Army BTT variants became MQM-33s and the KD2R-1, the only member of the family still in Navy service, became the MQM-36 Shelduck. The MQM-36 was the most evolved of the BTT family, but retained the same general configuration as the other members. It was larger and more sophisticated than the first-generation OQ-2A series, and was powered by a more powerful flat- four four-stroke McCulloch piston engine with 72 horsepower. The MQM-36 carried Luneberg lens radar enhancement devices in its wingtips that generated a radar signature of a larger aircraft. The radar reflectors (Luneberg lens) wasn't used by the US Navy as the air search radar interfered with the control signals. Thus the air search radar was not used. Launch was by RATO booster or bungee catapult, and recovery by parachute. MQM-57 Falconer A variant of the BTT designated the RP-71,\\"Pilotless Photo Drone Takes Aerial Pictures\\" Popular Mechanics, June 1956, p. 144 bottom article. also known as the SD-1 Observer and later redesignated MQM-57 Falconer, was built for battlefield reconnaissance, with first flight in 1955. The Falconer was similar in appearance to the Shelduck, but had a slightly longer and stockier fuselage. It had an autopilot system with radio-control backup, and could carry cameras, as well as illumination flares for night reconnaissance. Equipment was loaded through a hump in the back between the wings. Although it only had an endurance of a little more than a half-hour, making it of limited use, about 1,500 Falconers were built and the type was used internationally with several different military forces, remaining in service into the 1970s. Over 73,000 BTT targets were built in all, and the type was used by at least 18 nations. Some may still be lingering in service.

The genus occurs from southern Nicaragua to southern Ecuador. Systematics Cochliostema is a member of the subtribe Dichorisandrinae of the tribe Tradescantieae of the flowering plant family Commelinaceae. Its closest relative in the Dichorisandrinae is Plowmanianthus, followed by Geogenanthus. All three genera share the possession of flower petals fringed with moniliform trichomes. Within Cochliostema there are two species: Cochliostema velutinum R.W.Read and Cochliostema odoratissimum Lemaire. Cochliostema jacobianum, a 19th-century name thought to represent another species and still popular among horticulturists, is considered as part of the latter species. Morphology Rosette, typically unbranched herbs with somewhat succulent, strap-shaped leaves. In the wild, plants grow as epiphytes; however, terrestrial plants are found on or around tree falls suggesting that these ground-dwelling plants had been growing epiphytically. One species, Cochliostema odoratissimum, is a tank-epiphyte, resembling certain bromeliads in this respect. This species also attains the greatest size for the genus, with its leaves reaching to 1 m in length, and plants sometimes reaching 2 m in height. Flowers are borne in large thyrses and are generally the largest (ca. 2.5 cm diam.), among the most fragrant, and arguably the most complex in the spiderwort family. They consist of 3 sepals, 3 blue to blue-violet and fringed petals, 3 stamens fused by their filaments in the upper half of the flower, and 3 carpels fused into a single trilocular pistil. The fused staminal structure has 3 spirally coiled anthers enveloped and concealed by petaloid extensions of the filaments of the two lateral stamens contributing to the 3-staminate structure. These structures, termed \\"cuculli\\", are narrowed into two distal hose-like extensions.

History Garden Town was acquired in 1960 by the Lahore Development Authority, which at that time was called the Lahore Improvement Trust. Prior to that the majority of the land was being used for agriculture. Due to its close proximity to Canal Road, it was a popular place to settle among businessmen. During the 1970s urban development increased significantly, when Punjab University opened its new campus along Garden Town's northern boundary. Development continued up until the 1980s and by the 1990s most of the plots had been developed. Today, Garden Town is among the most affluent suburbs of the city. Location Garden Town is located within the administrative town of Gulberg. The borders surrounding Garden Town are: * North - Canal Bank Road, Punjab University, New Campus * South - Model Town * East - Gulberg * West - Faisal Town Blocks Garden Town is divided into 12 blocks: * Garden Block - plot measuring 1000, 2000 and 4000 square yards (2,4 and 8 kanal) * Ahmed Block - plots measuring 5000 square yards facing the canal (10 kanal) * Abu Bakr Block - plots measuring 5000 square yards (10 kanal) * Ali Block - plot measuring 175 and 250 square yards (7 and 10 marla) as well as 4000 square yard (8 kanal) plots located on Abul Hassan Isfahani Road. * Usman Block - plots measuring 500, 1000 and 2000 square yards (1, 2 and 4 kanal) * Jevan Hana/Abadi Devasabad - located between Usman, Ali, Garden and Ahmed Blocks is an area called Abadi Devasabad and plots neighboring this abadi have lower value * Tipu Block - originally had plot sizes measuring 1000, 2000 and 4000 square yards (2, 4 and 8 kanal), but after subdivisions, 500 square yard (1 kanal) plots were only available * Babar Block - originally had plot sizes measuring 1000, 2000 and 4000 square yards (2, 4 and 8 kanal), but after subdivisions, 500 square yard (1 kanal) plots were only available * Aibak Block - plots measuring 500 to 2000 square yards (1 and 4 kanal) * Aurangzeb Block - plots measuring 500 and 1000 square yards (1 and 2 kanal) * Tariq Block - plots measuring 500 and 1000 square yards (1 and 2 kanal) * Ata Turk Block - plots measuring 125 square yards (5 marla) to 1000 square yards (2 kanal) * Sher Shah Block - plots measuring 125 square yards (5 marla) to 1000 square yards (2 kanal) Residents Garden Town has a population of 250,000 people, and is among the most popular neighbourhoods in Lahore due to its prime location. The majority of its residents belong to the upper middle class and consist of businessmen as well as students who attend the various colleges and universities in the area, namely Punjab University. It is also home to some celebrities, politicians and overseas Pakistanis. The community in recent years has developed a vibrant social life and a literate elite. Property value has increased significantly in the past five years due to location of Garden Town and the development of Barakat Market. A typical residential home in the area can cost anywhere from U.S. $100,000 to $450,000.

There are many shopping malls, restaurants and cafes in the area as well the famous Mughal-e-Azam wedding hall. Transportation Commercialization in this area has immensely increased the traffic flow, not only on the main roads but also on the small lanes and access roads which are unable to cope with the large volume. This has been primarily due to the mushroom growth of small institutes, ranging from tuition academies to schools, offices and colleges operating here. Commuting to different parts of the city is easy due to adequate public transport. Garden Town is among the regions to be served by the future Lahore Metro.

Initially it was known as the Maynooth Mission to China.Columban Sisters \\"History\\" Members may be priests, seminarians or lay workers.Columban Fathers \\"Frequently Asked Questions\\" Fr John Blowick, one of the two founders of the Society, also founded the Missionary Sisters of St. Columban to share in their work. The society is dedicated to St. Columbanus. The current international headquarters is in Hong Kong. Foundation The Society was founded through the inspiration of the Reverend (later Bishop) Edward Galvin of Ireland (1882-1956). Galvin had considered serving as a missionary as a young man, but he was dissuaded by the concerns of his parents over such a life. He entered St Patrick's College (usually called Maynooth Seminary) near Dublin to study for the priesthood for his native Diocese of Cork, and was ordained in 1909. Due to an oversupply of clergy for that diocese, his bishop suggested that Galvin offer his service in the United States, until such time as there would be an opening in Cork. Galvin followed his advice and went to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn in New York City, where he was assigned to Holy Rosary Parish. While serving there, Galvin came to know John M. Fraser, a Canadian priest, who stayed there while en route back to China. Galvin shared with Fraser his interest serving in China. Galvin told Fraser that he had read everything he could about that nation in the Brooklyn Public Library and asked to accompany Fraser back to China. Fraser discouraged Galvin's interest but finally told him that he would need the authorization of his bishop for this action. Galvin wrote and received this permission. Galvin departed for China on 25 February 1912. Mission to China Galvin first traveled to Toronto, Ontario, Canada, to meet Fraser. Together they traveled across the country to Vancouver, where they set sail for China on the RMS Empress of India (1890). He then began to serve in Zhejiang (then spelled Chekiang), where he spent the next four years. During that time, Galvin was appalled at the poverty and began to request help and assistance from his connections back in Ireland. He was even more appalled by what he called their 'spiritual poverty'. Here were millions of friendly and industrious people who, because of the lack of missionaries, knew nothing of Jesus Christ. He was joined in 1916 by two other priests, Frs. Patrick O'Reilly and Joseph O'Leary. The three soon realized that some kind of organized effort would be needed to adequately deal with the situation. His new colleagues urged Galvin to return to Ireland to establish a new missionary Society. Galvin was hesitant but eventually felt called to take this step.Columban Fathers \\"Columban History in China\\" In June 1916, Galvin through to the United States on his way back to Ireland. He met with bishops and priests everywhere he went, presenting his proposal. He found general support and encouragement. He arrived in Ireland that August, where he proceeded to his alma mater, Maynooth, and began to recruit among the seminarians there for his proposed society. A local Curate, Thomas Roynane, introduced Galvin to one of the seminary faculty, John Blowick, who agreed to join the endeavor and was to prove an important contributor to the development of the Society. Within two months of his arrival, Galvin had recruited five more priests, bringing the new Maynooth Mission to China to a total of eight members. The Society Galvin then presented his proposal to the Holy See, which gave its blessing. Galvin and Blowick spent 1917 laying the foundations for the society. Formal approval for the group, now named the Society of St. Columban, was given by Rome on 29 June 1918, and a new seminary was immediately founded in Ireland to train new members for the missions. In the United States, a house soon was opened near Omaha, Nebraska, where another seminary was opened within a few years. The Society grew to number 40 priests and 60 seminarians by 1920. Galvin then led the first band of the Society to open their mission in the Hanyang District (modern day Wuhan, China). Galvin was named Apostolic Prefect of the Apostolic Prefecture of Hanyang by the Holy See in 1923 and later made the Apostolic Vicar of the promoted Apostolic Vicariate of Hanyang in 1927, with Galvin being consecrated as its titular bishop (it became a diocese under him in 1946, suffragan of Hankou). As they began their work, the missionaries encountered various calamities to which the region was subject, ranging from famines to flooding. They also soon found themselves in the middle of a civil war between the forces of the Guominjun Nationalist Army and the Chinese Communist Party, which lasted for the next three decades. This social instability allowed warlords to flourish and mission stations were routinely threatened by bandits. Supplies were often stolen en route and mission workers were frequently kidnapped. On July 15, 1929, Communist Army bandits captured Columban Fr Timothy Leonard. After a few days as a prisoner, they murdered him. Others, though, were taken captive and released, but one, Father Cornelius Tierney, died after three months of harsh captivity. In the fall of 1932, Chiang Kai-shek's nationalist republican troops began attacking the Communists with a vigor never seen before. The Communists fell back on all fronts, and, once more, people could move about with relative safety. \\"The reign of terror,\\" wrote one Columban, \\"far from weakening the appeal of the Catholic Church in this area, seems to have strengthened it.\\" It was an extraordinary time as thousands expressed a sincere desire to enter the Church. In 1933, the Holy See designated a new territory for the Columbans and Fr Patrick Cleary was appointed in charge of the Apostolic Vicariate of Nancheng (in Nancheng County, south of Hanyang). The Japanese invasion of China in 1937 saw the Society challenged to care for both civilians and soldiers, as major outbreaks of Cholera swept the populace. This was soon followed by the outbreak of World War II, when members of the Society from the Allies of World War II had to be repatriated or face house arrest. The war had just ended when it became clear that Communist forces under Mao Tse-tung would soon defeat the Nationalists under Chiang Kai-shek. In 1946, the Holy See entrusted a new mission, known as Huchow, to the Columban Fathers. Three years later, the Communists took over this area, and, before long, they were in control of all of China. Several Columbans were thrown into jail and eventually all the Columban priests and Sisters were expelled. Bishops Galvin and Cleary were expelled in 1952. By 1954, every one of the 146 Columbans serving in China was \\"expelled forever.\\" On September 19, 1952, a weary, haggard man stumbled across the Communist China border into British concession enclave Hong Kong. Forty years of heroic missionary service had ended; Bishop Galvin was even branded a \\"criminal.\\" Three-and-a-half years later, death came quietly for this great Catholic missionary. Extension of the mission beyond China From 1929 onwards, the Society extended its mission to the Philippines (1929), Korea (1933), Burma (1936) and Japan (1948). The Society was active for many years in Australia, mainly in support of the mission to China.C. Rue, Distinctive and evolving characteristics of the Missionary Society of St Columban 1916-2016 (Maynooth Mission to China), Journal of the Australian Catholic Historical Society 37 (2) (2016), 69-81. When mainland China was closed to missionaries in the 1950s, the Society responded to the urgent call from Latin America and Columbans went to new urban settlements in Peru and Chile. The Society also responded to the missionary needs of the Church in Fiji (1952). Still more recently, the Society has gone to Pakistan, Taiwan, Brazil, Jamaica and Belize. Due to diminishing resources, the Society had to withdraw its commitment to Belize, Jamaica and Brazil. Columbans first went to Pakistan in 1979 at the request of the Bishop of Lahore in Punjab Province and in 1983, the Columbans began to work in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Hyderabad in Sindh province.

Plot After a sinister crash on the highway in a small New Mexican town, people start disappearing and animals begin dying. The cause of the crash is later revealed to be a 900-year-old creature which was unearthed during an archaeological dig in the area. Meanwhile, a gas station owner informs a group of people that the gas tank never arrived, which meant that the small group needed to spend the night at the gas station. Sheriff Annie is called to investigate the crash, and finds a strange piece of evidence. Annie then takes it to the gas station, where Nodin investigates it. It is clearly not human, and has many elements of DNA in it. It is later explained the creature is an alien weapon, devised by an extremely ancient civilization to collect DNA like some kind of probe or exploration device created using bio- technology, however it tends to do so in a decidedly lethal manner. At the bar, Carla finds male customers dead in the back lot. She runs back into the bar, and the creature then breaks in. It first injures her arm (and also causes her to shoot herself in the foot), and then it eventually butchers her. Back at the gas station, Caya and Charlie are flirting inside the motel room. Ally goes outside to throw out some garbage, and encounters Grandpa, thinking Ally was a coyote rustling through the trash. Ally then returns to the motel, but before she can enter, the creature rips its claw into her torso. Ally's dead body is thrown back into the room and onto the stove. Her dead body burns, causing a fire, and a gas leak. Annie, Nodin, and Grandpa go into the room where the creature is outside banging on the walls. Grandpa is then killed, and Nodin begins to panic. Annie then knocks her unconscious and they go out to the truck, after the room explodes into flames. After battling the monster countlessly, most of the group is killed. At the end, Annie confronts the monster, and believes she kills it by smashing it against a water tank with her car but the monster was only made unconscious for a while. Annie injects herself with the poison containing uranium (the only substance that makes the poison work against the monster) that was prepared by Nodin in order to kill the monster. The monster kills Annie and dies itself as soon as it comes in contact with the uranium in the poison. The remaining survivors, Caya and Nodin, place Annie's body in the back of their truck. They then drive off, leaving the monster in the dirt, where it is most likely going to become buried again.

Nezhat is also Chair of the Association of the Adjunct Clinical Faculty, Stanford University School of Medicine, and a Clinical Professor of OB/GYN at the University of California, San Francisco. Nezhat is a pioneer and leading practitioner in the field of laparoscopic surgery, also referred to as minimally invasive, endoscopic, keyhole, and Band-Aid surgery. Nezhat is best known for the surgical innovation referred to as video-laparoscopy or ‚Äúoperating off the monitor,‚Äù a method now widely accepted but which was, until recently, considered a controversial and questionable departure from classical laparotomy or open surgery.American Society of Reproductive Medicine.http://www.asrm.org/2012_Novel_Genetic_Tools/ Early life and education Nezhat was born in Shahreza, Iran, a small, rural town in the central part of the country. After taking a college entrance exam, Nezhat's score qualified him for acceptance to Tehran University School of Medicine, located in the capital city of Tehran. He attended from 1965 to 1972, and received his medical degree in 1972. After fulfilling a military conscription requirement, Nezhat attended and completed his residency program in obstetrics and gynecology at the State University of New York at Buffalo, from 1974-1978. He completed a fellowship in reproductive endocrinology and infertility in Augusta, Georgia, under Drs. Robert Greenblatt and Don Gambrell. After fulfilling this fellowship from 1978‚Äì1980, Nezhat started his own private practice in Atlanta, Georgia, with hospital privileges at Northside Hospital. He became certified by the American Board of Obstetrics & Gynecology in 1982. Nezhat holds medical licenses in the state of Georgia and California. Surgical techniques Nezhat introduced several innovations that were at first considered unacceptable deviations from classical surgical techniques. The first departure from traditional surgical methods occurred in approximately the mid-1970s, when Nezhat began experimenting in the lab with ‚Äúoperating off the monitor,‚Äù a phrase that refers to the method of performing endoscopic surgery (referred to as a laparoscope when used for abdominal surgeries) while viewing a TV/video monitor in an upright position, operating off the video images, instead of looking directly at the patient.Page, Barbara. \\"Nezhat & the Rise of Advanced Operative Video-Laparoscopy\\". in Alan Wetter. History of Endoscopy. Camran Nezhat. http://laparoscopy.blogs.com/endoscopyhistory/chapter_22/index.html. Prior to Nezhat's innovation, surgeons performed laparoscopy while peering directly into the endoscope's eyepiece, a method which limited their ability to perform operations because it left only one hand free, limited their field of vision, and required them to hunch over and move around in awkward positions. With these physical limitations in place, surgeons found it difficult to believe that operative laparoscopic techniques could replace classical surgery and, initially, many in the medical community considered the entire notion to be an untenable, unrealistic, and dangerous idea. The idea of using the endoscope as an operative device also went against at least 200 years of medical tradition, which had established the endoscope, since its approximately 1806 modern debut of endoscopy by Philip Bozzini,Bozzini P. Der Lichtleiter oder Beschreibungeiner einfachen Vorrichtung und ihrer Anwendung zur Erleuchtung innerer Hohlen und Zwischenraume des lebenden animalischen K√∂rpers. Weimar: Landes Industrie, Comptoir; 1807 as a predominantly diagnostic tool; operative applications in gynecology were confined to simple interventions, such as lysis of adhesions (removal of scar tissue), biopsies, draining of cysts, cautery of neoplasms, and tubal ligations. When Nezhat began using his new video-laparoscopic technique of operating off the monitor in an upright position, he was able to achieve more advanced operative procedures for the first time.Page, Barbara. \\"Nezhat & the Rise of Advanced Operative Video- Laparoscopy\\". in Alan Wetter. History of Endoscopy. Camran Nezhat. Performing these advanced surgeries laparoscopically was the second unorthodox conceptual change that Nezhat introduced. Other innovations by Nezhat that were considered controversial included the introduction of new surgical procedures and new surgical instrumentation designed specifically for use in laparoscopy. Because these new surgical concepts went against established norms of classical surgery and were believed to be dangerous, Nezhat fell under intense scrutiny and criticism from those within mainstream medical establishments, and later from the national newspapers (see ‚ÄúControversies‚Äù section below). For approximately the next 25 years, Nezhat became one of the most visible and controversial figures in the minimally invasive movement because of his vocal advocacy of these new techniques and for continuing to push the envelope by performing more advanced procedures laparoscopically. Even as late as the 2000s, there were many opponents to these techniques who continued to call into question the safety and necessity of video-laparoscopy, especially when used for more advanced laparoscopic techniques. However, by approximately the mid-1990s it can be established that most of the initial misgivings about video-laparoscopy had subsided because by then the nation's most prominent academic medical schools in the U.S., such as Stanford University School of Medicine, had adopted this change and began teaching it as part of the standard medical school curriculum. By the early 2000s, many medical societies, such as American Association of Gynecologic Laparoscopists, Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons, and SAGES, also began offering fellowships in advanced operative video-laparoscopy. There are still several contraindications for advanced operative video-laparoscopy, such as in emergency room medicine. However, with these and a few other exceptions, today the debate has now been resolved in favor of advanced operative video- laparoscopy for most surgical situations. The mainstream medical community has acknowledged operating off the monitor in video-laparoscopy to be the gold standard in various disciplines, such as gynecologic, gastrointestinal, thoracic, vascular, urological, and general surgery. For this reason, Nezhat has been cited by laparoendoscopic surgeons as the father of modern operative laparoscopy, for introducing important technological and conceptual breakthroughs that helped medicine move toward minimally invasive surgery.Podratz KC. Degree‚Äôs of Freedom: Degrees in Freedom: Advances in Gynecological and Obstetrical Surgery. In: Oldham C, et al, eds. Remembering Milestones and Achievements in Surgery: Inspiring Quality for a Hundred Years 1913-2012. American College of Surgeons; 2012:114-119. http://www.nxtbook.com/faircount/ACS100/ACS100/index.php. The reason that the medical community now considers advanced operative video-laparoscopy so important is that it provided an alternative to classical surgery ‚Äì laparotomy ‚Äì which required a large incision, between 12-14 inches, which exposed patients to serious, life-threatening complications. These large incisions were held open by metal clamps, called retractors (see image), which created even more trauma to the tissue. Though these open methods were convenient for the surgeon, it was very debilitating and painful for the patient, causing more adhesions (scar tissue), more extensive blood loss, necessitating large volume blood transfusions, and requiring longer hospital stays, with 1‚Äì3 weeks in the hospital, including possible time in the ICU, considered as normal outcomes. Another serious complication was chronic incisional hernias, a condition in which the incision fails to heal, causing it to continually ooze and break open, even for years after the surgery. However, the most important difference was that, when compared to video-laparoscopy, a laparotomy posed more serious, permanent, and life-threatening complications, including a higher incidence of death.Short RA. \\"The Uses of Coelioscopy. The British Medical Journal 1925; 254-255.King DS. \\"Postoperative. Pulmonary. Complications: A Statistical. Study. Based on Two. Years' Personal. Observation. Surgical Gynecol Obstet(vol?), 1933 By the late 1970s, with the exception of a few surgical virtuosos, such as Raoul Palmer,Palmer R. La coeloscopie gynecologique, ses possibilities et ses indications actualles. Semin Hop Paris. 30:441, 1954. Patrick Steptoe, and Kurt Semm, gynecologic surgeons were only able to use the laparoscope to perform a few simple operative procedures, such as aspiration of cysts, lysis of adhesions, cauterizing of neoplasms, biopsies, and tubal ligations. This meant that other, more complicated gynecologic surgical procedures, such as the treatment of advanced stage (stage IV) endometriosis, hysterectomies, radical hysterectomies for cancer, para aortic node dissections, tubal reaanastomosis (reconstructive surgery of the fallopian tubes), full removal of ovarian cysts, and myomectomies (full removal of fibroids), could only be done via laparotomy. Some of these conditions, such as endometriosis, fibroids, and cysts, can be chronic diseases that require multiple surgical interventions. This meant that, prior to minimally invasive surgery, many women underwent multiple laparotomies for only mild pathologies. In these cases, the surgical intervention of a laparotomy was considered to be more damaging than the disease itself. Prior to the advent of video laparoscopy, other types of surgeries (from other disciplines), such as the removal of the gallbladder (colecystectomy), bowel, bladder, and ureter resections and reaanastomoses, etc., were also only possible via laparotomy. Controversies This divide between the old way and the new led to a very intense philosophical debate within the medical community, causing antagonism between classical versus laparoscopic surgeons. Opponents of minimally invasive surgery accused laparoscopists of hiding their complication rates and advancing dangerous methods in order to seek fame and financial gain. Proponents accused classical surgeons of advocating outdated surgical procedures that were dangerous for patients, because they didn‚Äôt want to take the time and expense to learn the new techniques. By the late 1990s and early 2000s, this internecine fighting became especially intense, culminating in even more serious allegations made against laparoscopists, including Nezhat, who had come to represent one of the minimally invasive movement's most visible leaders.Page, Barbara. \\"Nezhat & the Rise of Advanced Operative Video-Laparoscopy\\". in Alan Wetter. History of Endoscopy. Camran Nezhat. http://laparoscopy.blogs.com/endoscopyhistory/chapter_22/index.html Two lawsuits in particular also triggered nationwide media coverage about Nezhat and minimally invasive surgery. Starting in approximately April 2000, a series of newspaper articles were published about Nezhat, and his two surgeon brothers, Farr and Ceana, outlining all of the allegations claimed in these lawsuits. In one case, filed by former patient, Debra Manov, online court records show that the patient withdrew her medical malpractice claim with prejudice on July 21, 1998, after not being able to find a medical expert to corroborate her claims. The judge ruled that the claims were baseless and/or frivolous and dismissed Manov's entire case. The judge imposed a fine against Manov's attorney for filing a frivolous lawsuit. Another former patient, Mary (Stacey) Mullen, and her attorney, Jim Neal, claimed that Nezhat's surgery caused her permanent damage to her bowel. Mullen and Neal (and later Mullen's new attorney, Byrne) also accused Nezhat of battery and of being involved in RICO offenses (Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations). The judge found these and several other claims to be baseless and frivolous. Jim Neal was disqualified from Mullen's case by a Georgia judge in 1995 for \\"unethical behavior‚Ä¶\\" After a federal judge tossed out Neal's attempt to use racketeering charges against the Nezhats, Neal was charged with contempt of court. The final outcome is not known for some portions of the Mullen lawsuit, since some of the court records are sealed. However, what court records online show is that Mullen withdrew her lawsuit on May 24, 2002. Later news reports came out describing the case as ‚Äúresolved,‚Äù suggesting that an out-of-court settlement was reached. For these two cases, the plaintiff attorney, Jim Neal, hired two Stanford-affiliated doctors, Dr. Thomas Margolis and Dr. Nicola Spirtos, as his medical experts. Spirtos and Margolis, two gynecologic surgeons who were partners in a Palo Alto clinic called Women's Cancer Center (now closed), also accused Nezhat of various offenses, including of performing dangerous, experimental surgeries with the laparoscope. They suggested that Stanford failed to fully investigate Nezhat because his high-profile status - he was referred to by the press as a celebrity surgeon - was reportedly translating to millions of dollars for their bottom line. In Nezhat's defense, officials at Stanford said they investigated every claim and found them baseless, and described Spirtos and Margolis as ‚Äújealous competitors.‚ÄùMetro http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/07.05.01/cover/nezhet1-0127.html In this vein, Stanford officials and Nezhat supporters mentioned that Spirtos‚Äô private clinical practice was one floor down from Nezhat's. Spirtos also lost an election at Stanford to Nezhat, for the position of deputy chief of the obstetrics and gynecology department. Proponents of the Nezhat's said these surgeries were not experimental. Dr. Robert R. Franklin, a clinical professor in the department of obstetrics and gynecology at Houston's Baylor College of Medicine, said that In my opinion, the surgery performed on Mary (Stacey) Mullen was a necessary procedure and would not require any special consent form for experimental surgery. The controversy continued when it was reported that Spirtos had sued Stanford in 1991 for defamation ‚Äì claiming several things, including that he was discriminated against after becoming affiliated with the Women's Cancer Center, and that Stanford retaliated against him for speaking out against Nezhat. The Santa Clara County Superior Court judge found this lawsuit to be without merit and dismissed it (case title Spirtos M.D. -Vs-Stanford University, case number 1-01-CV-796939 ). The case was deemed frivolous by the judge and the court awarded Stanford $12,000 in attorneys‚Äô fees, payable by Spirtos and his attorney.http://www.stanforddaily.com/cgi- bin/?p=1007800 On February 21, 2001, Nezhat's research also fell under suspicion after a medical journal decided to retract two of his articles, both of which were co-authored by his brother, Dr. Farr Nezhat, and a colorectal surgeon, Dr. Earl Pennington. Data collected for these two articles were found to be flawed. Opponents claimed that these mistakes were intentional and constituted research fraud. Proponents said that \\"the slight discrepancies in patient data had no impact on the paper's conclusions.\\"(from http://articles.sfgate.com/2001-02-21/news/17585742_1_stanford-hospitals- procedure-surgery/2) It was reported that the journal's decision to retract the articles was motivated by fear of lawsuits because it had received dozens of complaints by the attorney, Jim Neal, since approximately 1993. In response to these growing concerns about Nezhat's work, in November 2000 Stanford put together a blue-ribbon committee, with former California Supreme Court Justice Edward A. Panelli as the lead investigator. The other committee members were an expert on medical ethics from UC Davis, and a retired dean from Harvard University School of Medicine. On December 21, 2001, after even more newspaper articles came out about Nezhat, Phil Pizzo, who had been appointed dean of Stanford's medical school in April 2001, announced that he had decided to suspend Nezhat and his two brothers until he could make more investigations into the matter. In August 2002 this ad-hoc committee released its findings. It determined that all of the allegations were unsubstantiated and without basis, concluding that none of the three Nezhat brothers had engaged in any misconduct. The Nezhats were reinstated to Stanford in August 2002.Stanford cancels suspensions of 3 laser surgeons - http://articles.sfgate.com/keyword/medical-school Concerning the allegation of research fraud, the committee reported that it did find that errors were made in the two retracted articles, but in none of the other hundreds of publications by the Nezhats that were reviewed. The committee and Stanford cleared the Nezhats of any wrongdoing, determining that the errors were minor, inadvertent, and had no impact on the paper's conclusions. Two state medical boards ‚Äì from California and Georgia ‚Äì launched their own investigation of Nezhat and also found him to be not guilty of any misconduct.

He should not be confused with the better known John III Comyn, Lord of Badenoch, who was his cousin, and who was killed by Bruce in Dumfries in March 1306. Confusion between the two men has affected the study of this period of history. Buchan was the representative of a family that had long dominated the politics of Scotland. He was defeated by Bruce at the Battle of Barra and was subsequently forced to flee to England. Bruce's Harrying of Buchan destroyed support for the Comyns in northern Scotland. This defeat, together with Comyn's death that year, produced a significant and lasting shift in the balance of power in Scotland. Comyns of Buchan The Comyns, a family of Norman origin, first made their appearance in Scotland during the reign of David I. In 1136 William Comyn, who had formerly been in the service of Henry I of England, became Chancellor of Scotland. William Comyn was part of a new class of French-speaking foreigners whose power and status in Scotland was entirely dependent on their service to the king. They were to be used by David and his successors in extending royal authority to the semi- independent fringes of the kingdom. The Comyns first grants of land were in the south of Scotland. In 1212 they made their most significant advance when William Comyn, Justiciar of Scotia, married Marjorie, the only child and heir of Fergus, the \\"earl\\" or mormaer of Buchan. The lordship encompassed a large area in the north-east of Scotland. When their son Alexander succeeded them, the Comyns became the first family of Norman origin to acquire comital status in Scotland . This allowed Comyns to gain a head start on the Bruces, also of Norman-French origin, who did not acquire the earldom of Carrick until the later thirteenth century. William also advanced Comyn power by acquiring for his son, Walter Comyn, the southern section of the old earldom of Moray, the Lordship of Badenoch, which also included the more westerly district of Lochaber. By the middle of the thirteenth century Comyn leadership thus extended from the shores of Aberdeenshire westwards all the way to Loch Linnhe. The family remained in power through the successive reigns of Alexander II and Alexander III; but they might be said to have reached the heights of their power and influence during the reign of John Balliol . Competitors and kings In 1290 Margaret, Maid of Norway, the last descendant of the Canmore dynasty, died, leaving the Scottish throne with no clear successor. Thirteen competitors came forward, including Robert Bruce of Annandale, grandfather of the future king, and John Balliol. Although John Comyn, Lord of Badenoch, sometimes known as the Black Comyn, was one of the minor competitors, the weight of the family was behind the claim of Balliol, Badenoch's brother-in-law. Following the intervention of Edward I, Balliol finally emerged in 1292 as the strongest claimant in terms of feudal law, though the Bruce family was not reconciled to this outcome. Any successful future bid for the crown could only proceed with the co-operation, or by the destruction, of the house of Comyn. By 1292 the great division which was to dominate Scottish politics on and off for over fifty years had taken definite shape. John of Buchan John Comyn became third earl of Buchan following the death of his father, Alexander, in 1289. Comyn was some 30 years of age at the time. He was prominent in John Balliol's administration, emerging as Constable of Scotland by 1293. He was one of those summoned by Edward I, in his capacity as the Feudal overlord of Scotland, to serve in the wars in France. When King John agreed to the demands of the English king for Scottish participation in the war, Buchan and others, took management of the kingdom into their own hands. The new government concluded an alliance with France and prepared for war with England. In the first act of that war Buchan, along with his cousin, John, the Red Comyn, son of the Black Comyn and nephew of King John, led an attack on Carlisle. This attack was under the command of Robert Bruce, Earl of Carrick, son of the competitor. Thus it might be said that what was to become the War of Scottish Independence opened with a clash between the Comyns and the Bruces. The attack on Carlisle was a failure; so too was the whole Scottish campaign of 1296. Edward, having knocked out the main Scottish host at the Battle of Dunbar, moved North in rapid stages. Buchan and King John surrendered at Montrose in July, along with other leading Scottish nobles. John of Buchan was stripped of the symbols of power and taken south to the Tower of London. Buchan was imprisoned in England south of the River Trent. In June 1297, he promised to serve in the army against France. That same year Scotland was engulfed in a widespread rebellion, led by Andrew Moray in the North and William Wallace in the South of the country. Moray's rising was of particular interest to Buchan, because it touched on the borders of his own estates. It was with the intention of bringing Moray under control, that Edward finally sent Buchan back to his home in July, 1297. War of the Comyns For Buchan, the task of bringing Moray under control would demand diplomatic skill, involving national politics and family loyalties. Moray was known to him, as the son of his close neighbor Sir Andrew Moray of Petty and Avoch. Andrew Moray, at the time, was still in prison in England. Long political allies, there was also a family association between the Morays and the Comyns. Sir Andrew had taken as his second wife Euphemia Comyn, the daughter of the first Lord of Badenoch. To do nothing, or even to join the rebels, involved risks for Comyn, becausethe Red Comyn was with Edward in Flanders. In the end the two sides met up on the banks of the Spey. Afterward, Moray retired into a \\"great stronghold of bog and wood\\" where he could not be followed, as Buchan later offered Edward by way of excuse. Hugh de Cressingham, the chief agent of the English occupation, expressed his opinion that this was a thinly disguised double-act, writing that \\"the peace on the other side of the Scottish sea (Firth of Forth) is still in obscurity, as it is said, as to the doings of the earls who are there.\\" The Guisborough Chronicle had little doubt of Comyn's culpability, who \\"at first pretended to repress rebellion but in the end changed sides and became a thorn in our flesh.\\" However, later that year, shortly before the Battle of Stirling Bridge, Buchan was still believed to be loyal by the English government. The reality is that Wallace and Moray could scarcely have met up, or even recruited sufficient forces in the north, without the tacit approval of Buchan and his associates. The noble and the guardian Buchan can be said to have made at least some indirect contribution to the victory at Stirling, though he was not personally present at the battle. Afterwards his career goes through a period of particular obscurity, few details having survived. It seems certain, though, that the death of Moray, either during or shortly after the battle, and the political ascendancy of William Wallace, who emerged as Guardian of Scotland by early 1298, had an effect on his general attitude towards the rising. It is important to remember that few if any of the major players at this time were either the selfless patriots or the dark villains depicted by later history. Personal advantage and self-interest were always significant factors. For Buchan, and many of his fellow nobles, Wallace was less of the great hero and more of the political parvenu, who by the normal order of things would have been a figure of little importance in a conservative feudal society. It would therefore have been particularly galling for Buchan to see the vacant bishopric of St Andrews filled, at Wallace's behest, by William Lamberton in place of the man he had expected to take the position, Master William Comyn, his own brother. Both John Fordun and John Barbour said in their chronicles, although their neutrality could be questioned, that the Comyns abandoned Wallace at the Battle of Falkirk. Their interpretation of events involves some intellectual acrobatics: Fordun condemns the Comyns for losing the battle for Wallace, while in the next breath he commends Robert Bruce, the future king, for winning it for the English. Yet, setting this interpretation of events aside, the evidence suggests Comyn hostility towards Wallace, magnified, perhaps, by Lamberton's known association with the Bruce family. Shortly after the defeat at Falkirk, Wallace resigned as Guardian. He was replaced by Robert Bruce the younger, who had now joined the patriots, and John Comyn of Badenoch, who had returned to Scotland. This uneasy match was obviously intended to balance the competing interests in Scotland; for though Bruce acted with the Red Comyn in the name of \\"the illustrious King John\\", his claim to the throne was openly known. In 1299 the whole delicate structure threatened to fall apart at a meeting of the baronial council at Peebles, a potentially murderous episode reported by an English spy. David Graham, an adherent of the Comyns, made a surprise intervention; At the council Sir David Graham demanded the lands and goods of Sir William Wallace because he was leaving the kingdom without the leave or approval of the Guardians. And Sir Malcolm Wallace, Sir William's brother, answered that neither his lands nor his goods should be given away, for they were protected by the peace in which Wallace left the kingdom. At this the two knights gave the lie to each other and drew their daggers. And since Sir David was of Sir John Comyn's following and Sir Malcolm Wallace of the Earl of Carrick's following, it was reported to the Earl of Buchan and John Comyn that a fight had broken out without their knowing it; and John Comyn leaped at the Earl of Carrick and seized him by the throat, and the Earl of Buchan turned on the Bishop of St. Andrews, declaring that treason and lesemajestie were being plotted. Eventually the Stewart and others came between them and quitened them. Lamberton was added to the panel of Guardians with the intention of keeping the peace, an odd arrangement considering the Comyns' hostility towards him. In the end he had to step down when The Red Comyn declared that he no longer wished to serve with him. Bruce himself stepped down in 1300, at a time when the restoration of King John looked like a serious possibility, the chief political aim of the whole Comyn family. The Comyns in power From about 1300 to 1304 the war of Scotland was also, in a sense, the war of the Comyns. With his cousin as Guardian, Buchan was occupied as Justiciar North of the Forth, holding court at Aberdeen in early 1300. He was also active on the border, taking part in raids against the English and in Galloway, where, as sheriff of Wigtown, he attempted to win over the local people to the national cause. In 1301 he joined with John de Soules in campaigning against the English army in the valley of the River Clyde. The following year he was chosen to take part in an embassy to Paris to try to prevent a peace treaty between England and France. In his absence his cousin helped beat an English force at the Battle of Roslin, but this was a false dawn, overtaken by ensuing darkness. Edward, preparing for a major offensive against Scotland, persuaded Philip IV to exclude her from the Treaty of Paris, signed in May 1303. Buchan joined with the other ambassadors in writing words of encouragement to his cousin: In the end Edward's invasion in 1303, by far the strongest since 1296, proved too strong to resist. As the English army punched north of the Forth, the first time it had done so since 1296, threatening the Comyn estates in Buchan and Badenoch, the Guardian took the pragmatic step, entering into peace negotiations with King Edward, concluded at Strathord near Perth in February 1304. Paradoxically the Comyns did not fare too badly, still figuring in the government of Scotland even after the conquest. Edward I, despite his fierce reputation, and his implacable hatred for men like Wallace, was by political and economic necessity forced to compromise. In Scotland he could not afford the ruinous cost in men, money and materials that it had taken to secure his earlier conquest of Wales, so time and again he was forced to enter into bonds and alliances with his former enemies. Buchan's lands confiscated at one minute were returned at the next, and he was made a member of the council of regency under the new English governor, John of Brittany, Earl of Richmond; and in September 1305 he was one of the commissioners who attended the union Parliament at Westminster to accept Edward's Ordinances for the government of Scotland. Murder and blood feud By 1306 it was plain to all that John Balliol, now in retirement on his French estates, would never return to Scotland. His kingship was dead but the Balliol claim was not. It was best represented by Edward Balliol, the former king's son, but he was still in English captivity and would be for some time to come. The next best candidate was the Red Comyn, King John's nephew. His greatest competitor was, of course, Robert Bruce, who had submitted to the English as long ago as 1302, but had never fully abandoned his own royal ambitions. Since 1286 the threat of civil war between the houses of Bruce and Balliol had haunted and shaped Scottish politics. On 10 February 1306 Bruce and his associates murdered Comyn and his uncle in Dumfries; the threat now became a reality. We will never know for certain the reasons behind the killing of the Red Comyn: for the Scottish sources it was the justified fate of a traitor and a spy; for the English it was a bloody and premeditated crime. The one thing they both agree on is that the Comyn family in general, and the Red Comyn in particular, was a major obstacle on the path of Bruce's ambition. The killing of 1306 was thus rewriting the judgement of 1292. Seizing the political high ground, Bruce was crowned at Scone on 25 March in an improvised ceremony. The Stone of Scone was missing; so too was the Earl of Fife, who by custom placed all new kings on the throne as the foremost of the Scottish earls. In a surprise move Isabella MacDuff, his sister, who also happened to be Buchan's wife, arrived bringing her husband's war horses and claimed the right for herself. Accordingly, another ceremony was held two days after the first. We have no insight into the precise reasons why she took a different view of matters from her husband. Buchan, as far as we know, took no action to save Isabella from the fate that her actions were shortly to bring upon her, though as Edward's chief Scottish adherent his views on the matter would certainly have carried some weight. Some sources say that he wanted her executed. With Bruce having gone one way it was inevitable that Buchan and his associates would go the other: men, in other words, whose patriotic credentials had hitherto been impressive were now guaranteed to fight on the side of the English. Setting aside Bruce's obvious skills as a soldier and a political strategist, this was the key to the ultimate failure of the Comyns: people who took no position on the murder in Dumfries would identify themselves with a new and successful King of Scots against a party invariably ranged on the side of the national enemy. War and terror At the outset, the combination of forces ranged against Bruce were formidable but widely scattered. He was to deal with them piece by piece, a task made all the easier by the death of Edward I in July 1307 and the accession of the far less capable Edward II. With the main English army absent from the scene Bruce dealt with his enemies in Scotland with ruthless determination. Following successful campaigns in Galloway and Argyllshire he concentrated all his efforts and resources against the earl of Buchan, his principal domestic enemy. The campaign against Comyn was to last from late 1307 right through to the spring of 1308, prolonged after the king was overtaken by a bout of serious illness. This was, perhaps, the best opportunity for Comyn to destroy his enemy. With Bruce incapacitated, and the royal army reduced in numbers, an attack was mounted against his camp at Slioch near Huntly; but it was pressed with no great determination, and Buchan withdrew after some desultory arrow fire. Unfortunately the only sources we have for the whole campaign in the north-east are uniformly hostile to Comyn. There are two possibilities here: either Buchan's talents as a soldier were limited, or he could not fully rely on the forces at his disposal. The evidence suggests a combination of both factors. The campaign concluded in December 1307 or May 1308, depending on which source is correct, when Buchan's army collapsed at the Battle of Inverurie. Eventually, Buchan fled to England after his earldom was subjected to systematic devastation. The Harrying of Buchan was carried out with one aim in mind: to destroy forever Comyn power in north-east Scotland. For once the devastation were carried out not by the English but by Scots against their fellow Scots, so thorough and effective that it was remembered for some fifty years after the event. As a piece of political terrorism it was supremely effective. A similar herschip in Galloway did not destroy the loyalties of the local people for the Balliol family, which were to resurface in the 1330s. But the earldom of Buchan would never again rise for the Comyns. In England the fugitive earl was well received by King Edward, who appointed him warden of the west marches in June 1308; but he was not to enjoy his new responsibilities for long, dying sometime before December. Alice Comyn, his niece and heir, married Henry Beaumont, a French nobleman in the English service. Beaumont was to claim the earldom of Buchan in right of his wife, a claim pursued with such relentless determination that it was a major factor in bringing about the Second War of Scottish Independence in the 1330s and beginning anew the war between the Comyns and the Bruces.

The theory has been summarized in one sentence by Schacht: ‚ÄúIn areas of circumscribed agricultural land, population pressure led to warfare that resulted in the evolution of the state‚Äù.Schacht, Robert M., ‚ÄúCircumscription Theory: A Critical Review,‚Äù American Behavioral Scientist, vol. 31, no. 4, pp. 439, March/April 1988.Graber, Robert B., and Paul Roscoe, ‚ÄúIntroduction: Circumscription and the Evolution of Society,‚Äù American Behavioral Scientist, vol. 31, no. 4, pp. 406, March/April 1988. The more circumscribed is an agricultural area, Carneiro argues, the sooner it politically unifies. Outline of the theory The theory begins with some assumptions. Warfare usually disperses people rather than uniting them. Environmental circumscription occurs when an area of productive agricultural land is surrounded by a less productive area such as the mountains, desert, or sea. Application of extensive agriculture would bring severely diminishing returns. If there is no environmental circumscription, then losers in a war can migrate out from the region and settle somewhere else. If there is environmental circumscription, then losers in warfare are forced to submit to their conquerors, because migration is not an option and the populations of the conquered and conqueror are united. The new state organization strives to alleviate the population pressure by increasing the productive capacity of agricultural land through, for instance, more intensive cultivation using irrigation. Primary and secondary state development Primary state development occurred in the six original states of the Nile Valley, Peru, Mesoamerican, Yellow River Valley China, Indus River Valley, and Mesopotamia. Secondary state development occurred in states that developed from contact with already existing states. Primary state development occurred in areas with environmental circumscription. The presumption, under the Carneiro Hypothesis, is that agricultural intensification, and the social coordination and coercion necessary to achieve this end was a result of warfare in which vanquished populations could not disperse; the coercive coordination necessary for increased production of surplus is, under Carneiro's hypothesis, a causal factor in the origins of the State. For example, the mountainous river valleys of Peru which descend to the Pacific coast were severely environmentally circumscribed. Amazonian populations could always disperse and maintain sparse contact with other, potentially hostile, neighbors, whereas Andean coastal populations could not. Criticism Carneiro's theory has been criticized by the Dutch \\"early state school\\" emerging in the 1970s around cultural anthropologist Henri J.M. Claessen, on the ground that considerable contrary evidence can be found to Carneiro's theory. There are also cases of circumscribed environments and violent cultures which have failed to develop states, for example in the narrow highland valleys of interior Papua New Guinea, or the north west Pacific coastlines of North America. Also for example, the formation of some early states in East Africa, Sri Lanka, and Polynesia do not easily fit with Carneiro's model. Hence Claessen's school developed a \\"complex interaction model\\" to explain early state formation, in which factors such as ecology, social and demographic structures, economic conditions, conflicts, and ideology become aligned in ways which favour state organisation.For some other criticisms see, e.g., Korotayev A. Circumscription Theory of the Origins of the State: A Cross-Cultural Re-Analysis. Cliodynamics 7/2 (2016): 187‚Äì203. Later development and revision The theory has since been applied to many other contexts, with some arguing it can be applied globally.One of the leading experts on world-systems theory, Christopher Chase-Dunn, noted in 1990 that the circumscription theory is applicable for the global system. \\"World State Formation: Historical Processes and Emergent Necessity,\\" California: Institute for research on World System, working paper 1, 1990, http://irows.ucr.edu/papers/irows1.txxt Carneiro has since also revised his theory in various ways. He has argued that population concentration can act as a lower level impetus for tribal conflict than geographic circumscription. He has also argued that, in addition to the necessities of conquest, a more important reason for creation of chiefdoms was the rise of war chiefs who use their military loyalists to take over a group of villages and become paramount chiefs.Carneiro, Robert. 2012.

According to Christopher Henley, artistic director of the Washington Shakespeare Company, \\"Bart was one of the half-dozen or so of the most seminal influences on and pioneers of what theatre in D.C. was and has become.

History Opened in 1932 by the Schwab brothers, Schwab's Pharmacy in Hollywood became the most famous and longest-operating outlet of their small retail chain. Like many drug stores in the United States during the mid- twentieth century, Schwab's sold medicines and had a counter serving ice cream dishes and light meals. Schwab's menu from 1955 Schwab's closed in October 1983. Five years later, on October 6, 1988, the building was demolished to make way for a shopping complex and multiplex theater. Sidney Skolsky, a syndicated Hollywood gossip columnist for the New York Daily News who was the first journalist to use the nickname \\"Oscar\\" for the Academy Award in print, made Schwab's famous in the 1930s. He used the drugstore as his office and called his column in Photoplay, the premier movie magazine in the United States at the time, \\"From a Stool at Schwab's.\\" A persistent Hollywood legend has it that actress Lana Turner was \\"discovered\\" by director Mervyn LeRoy while at the soda counter at Schwab's. While the 16-year-old Turner was discovered at a soda counter, the location was not Schwab's but another establishment, the Top Hat Cafe, farther east on Sunset Boulevard at McCadden Place, directly across the street from Hollywood High School, where she was still a student. The person who discovered her was not LeRoy but Hollywood Reporter publisher William Wilkerson. Today, there is a replica of the establishment at Universal Studios Florida that sells Ben & Jerry's ice cream and drinks. In popular media Schwab's Pharmacy appears in the Netflix limited series, Hollywood. Jack Castello's wife, Henrietta is shown to work at the store, alongside coworker Erwin Kaye. Schwab's appears in the 1950 film Sunset Boulevard (film). Schwab's is referenced in the 1964 hit song by Jan and Dean, Dead Man's Curve. The song describes a fictional race down West Sunset Blvd where they \\"flew past La Brea, Schwab's and Crescent Heights\\".

Land use 8 Spruce Street, seen from Park Row (2012) Although government-related activities are predominant, other pursuits also occur within the district, including entertainment, industrial activity, residential dwellings, and warehousing. For example, there are Chinese restaurants near Civic Center's border with Chinatown, in addition to some museums and some residential buildings in the Civic Center area. The area is roughly 10 blocks long and 5 blocks wide, but is far less dense than most of Manhattan, where the average number of residents for an area that size is 35,000; the Civic Center has approximately 20,000 residents. The Jacob K. Javits Federal Building is located in the area. It includes the Federal Bureau of Investigation New York field office.\\"New York Field Office.\\" Federal Bureau of Investigation. Retrieved on June 9, 2015. \\"26 Federal Plaza, 23rd Floor New York, NY 10278-0004\\" Non-government buildings include the 15 Park Row, an office and residential building which was the city's highest from 1899 to 1908. The 21-story granite 150 Nassau Street building was once a publisher's building, as were many in the area, but is now a residential building, as is the Potter Building at 38 Park Row. The 76-story 8 Spruce Street is among the world's tallest residential buildings. Southbridge Towers, once Mitchell-Lama affordable housing, is now market-rate housing. Lenape settlement A 1798 watercolor of the Collect Pond Originally, the Lenape American Indians occupied the Civic Center area due to its rich pastoral fields and its proximity to the East River and Hudson River. There was a series of marshes in the area and a big pond in what is now Foley Square that the early settlers called ‚ÄúThe Collect‚Äù or ‚ÄúCollect Pond‚Äù. The area was so low lying that during the spring floods, the Indians could paddle from the East River to the Hudson River through the Collect Pond. Then in 1609, Henry Hudson, an English explorer working for the Dutch, came and claimed the land for the Dutch. The colony there grew and farms began to expand, so the demand for workers increased. The Dutch West Indies Company decided to import slaves in 1625 to the new colony. The Civic Center was known as the commons and the first recorded building was a windmill built by Jan de Wit and Denys Hartogveldt in 1663. The next year, the colony was renamed New York and the state seal was created the following year. Farms continued to grow and slavery expanded rapidly. The slaves built a burial ground in the north area of the Civic Center. The slaves would bury people at night even though it was illegal, to ensure their brethren had a proper burial service. Because of the slaves‚Äô sneaking out and racism, the Trinity Church banned African burial ceremonies in 1697. This rule was then overturned in 1773. The city continued expanding and the government system became increasingly powerful. The local government decided to finance their first public works building through public funding. In 1735, the Almshouse was built as a center to house the ill and impoverished, a jail, a workhouse and infirmary. A score later another jail was built called New Goal, which was a debtor prison. Soldier barracks were built on the western border of the commons.  Property development  City Hall Park During the Civil War, the old British soldiers‚Äô barracks were used as temporary barracks. Between 1869 and 1880, the City Hall Post Office and Courthouse was erected at the southern end of City Hall Park; the building was not well received and was destroyed in 1939. The Tweed Courthouse was also built at the north end of City Hall Park at the same time, being completed in 1881. Though the building had begun construction in 1861, work on the building stopped between 1872 and 1877 after the downfall of its patron Boss Tweed and the death of its primary architect. By the 1880s, the city of New York was rapidly growing; the population had increased to more than a million residents, and the government was outgrowing its offices. The mayor, Franklin Edson, recognized the need for more space for government offices and was reluctant to add onto the original City Hall building. Instead, between the years of 1888 and 1907, the city organized a series of competitions to choose designs for several new structures. On the western edge of the Civic Center, several buildings were completed in the 1890s. The first buildings to be completed were the Home Life and Postal Telegraph Buildings at Broadway and Murray Street, constructed simultaneously between 1892 and 1894, and later combined into one structure. Immediately to the north is the Rogers Peet Building, constructed in 1899 after a fire the previous year had razed its predecessor of the same name. In 1900, Cass Gilbert completed his first New York City design, the 18-story Broadway‚ÄìChambers Building at Broadway and Chambers Street. On December 3, 1897, people rejoiced by City Hall in celebration of the consolidation of the Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens, and Staten Island into the City of Greater New York. The new New York City numbered more than 4.5 million residents.  20th century  As seen from One World Observatory in June 2015 Pace University, on Park Row Post- consolidation, work on the New York City Subway's first line began in 1900, and the City Hall and Brooklyn Bridge stations opened in 1904. The Emigrant Savings Bank, a bank for Irish immigrants established at 51 Chambers Street in 1850, built the Emigrant Industrial Savings Bank Building on the site of their old headquarters between 1909 and 1912. Immediately to the east, the Surrogate's Courthouse, originally called the Hall of Records, was built between 1899 and 1907. The 40-story Municipal Building, at the intersection of Centre and Chambers Streets, was completed in 1914 and has a gilded Civic Fame statue on top of the tower. In 1906, the Pace brothers founded the firm of Pace & Pace to operate their schools of accountancy and business. Taking a loan of $600, the Pace brothers rented a classroom on one of the floors of the New York Tribune Building. The city continued to innovate, and in 1908, City Hall Park was renovated, and the old gaslights were replaced with electric ones. The Gothic style Woolworth Building, at Broadway between Park Place and Barclay Street, was designed by Cass Gilbert for Frank Winfield Woolworth, the owner of the \\"five and dime\\" Woolworth's retail chain. Completed in 1913, the Woolworth Building was the tallest building in the world until 1930; its ornamentation gave it the nickname the \\"Cathedral of Commerce\\". As early as 1915, Mekeel's Weekly Stamp News contained many advertisements for stamp dealers in Nassau Street. In the 1930s, stamp collecting became very popular, and Nassau Street was the center of New York City's \\"Stamp District\\", called its \\"Street of Stamps\\", with dozens of stamp and coin dealers along its short length. The Stamp Center Building was located at 116 Nassau Street, and the Subway Stamp Shop was located at 87 Nassau Street. During the Great Depression, masses gathered in City Hall Park as a place to protest the government. Renovations Under Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia, Robert Moses unveiled an ambitious plan to renovate the park in the late 1930s. The plan called for the Federal Post Office to be torn down, but this plan was stopped due to opposition from city officials and community groups. The Delacorte family donated the Shew Fountain. Twenty-one years later, Mayor Rudy Giuliani rededicated the park for 7.5 million dollars and removed the Shew Fountain. In 1964, the government of New York City was authorized to buy several plots north of City Hall Park. The redevelopment plans were ultimately scrapped due to the 1975 New York City fiscal crisis, but the city retained ownership of the Emigrant Savings Bank Building. Tweed Courthouse was renovated and redesigned between 1999 and 2001, becoming the Department of Education's headquarters in 2002. The former Emigrant Bank Building was converted into a condominium development called 49 Chambers in 2017.  Usages = African Burial Ground  In 1991, while constructing the Ted Weiss Federal Building, the excavators found thousands of graves. Scientists estimated that the land was the largest cemetery in the world for people of African descent, projecting that approximately 15,000 to 20,000 people were buried there, although only 420 bodies were excavated.Spencer P.M. Harrington, \\"Bones and Bureaucrats\\", Archaeology, March/April 1993. Retrieved February 11, 2012 The African Burial Ground National Monument was established, and a memorial site was constructed, opening in 2007. The visitor center was opened in 2010 and has a video on the discovery of the graves, sculptures of the burial process, and information on the lives of the slaves.  Newspaper publishing  Newspaper Row, before 1903 (the original Tribune Building from 1875 in the center) A wave of newspaper companies arose in 1835 after the invention of the steam press, which turned out printed sheets mechanically, replacing the old hand-cranked method. The convenience of mass production generated a penny press and mass consumption of sensational news. The Civic Center was always a desirable location for newspapers because it was so close to City Hall and the courts, but the numbers increased exponentially after the invention of the steam press. Park Row became known as ‚ÄúNewspaper Row‚Äù, and between the Civil War and World War I, 60 newspapers were published there. The New York Sun began publication in 1833, as a morning newspaper edited by Benjamin Day with the slogan: \\"It Shines for All\\". The newspaper's offices, a converted department store at 280 Broadway, between Chambers and Duane Streets, is famous for the clocks that bear the newspaper's masthead and motto. Horace Greeley created the New York Tribune in 1841 with the hopes of providing a straightforward, trustworthy media source in an era when newspapers such as the New York Sun and New York Herald thrived on sensationalism. The Tribunes original building was located on 30 Ann Street, but was moved to the New York Tribune Building in 1875. The New York Times first building was located at 113 Nassau Street in lower Manhattan. In 1854, it moved to 138 Nassau Street, and in 1858 it moved to 41 Park Row, making it the first newspaper in New York City housed in a building built specifically for its use. Frank Queen bought a small office on Nassau Street and began publishing the New York Clipper in 1853, making it the first American paper devoted entirely to entertainment; the paper eventually shortened its name to The Clipper. The paper was one of the earliest publications in the United States to regularly cover sports, and it played an important role in popularizing baseball in the country. In addition to more popular sporting events, the New York Clipper also wrote about billiards, bowling, and even chess. It began covering American football in 1880. The New York World was founded in 1860 but was a relatively unsuccessful New York newspaper from 1860 to 1883. Joseph Pulitzer purchased it in 1883, and a new, aggressive era of circulation building began. In 1890, Pulitzer built the New York World Building, the tallest office building in the world at the time (it was razed in 1955). The New York Journal was established in 1868, as a paper published every other day. The paper was barely financially stable and in 1895, William Randolph Hearst purchased it. He made major changes to the paper, and adopting the approach used by Joseph Pulitzer, he began competing with the New York World. Each publication would compete by fabricating and embellishing stories more than the other. They increased their title font sizes, and focused more on the title than the actual story. The Revolution, also established in 1868, was a women's rights newspaper founded by Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony. The New York Press was a New York City newspaper that began publication in December 1887 and published notable writers such as Stephen Crane. It also coined the term \\"yellow journalism\\" in early 1897, to refer to the work of Joseph Pulitzer's New York World and William Randolph Hearst's New York Journal. The Daily People was a weekly newspaper established in New York City in 1891, and is best remembered as a vehicle for the ideas of Daniel DeLeon (1852‚Äì1914), the dominant ideological leader of the Socialist Labor Party of America. Yellow journalism The New York Press said, in 1898, about papers practicing \\"yellow journalism\\": it \\"We called them Yellow because they are Yellow.\\" The \\"yellow journalism\\" tactics used by the New York Journal and the New York World increased circulation and influenced the content and style of newspapers in most of the America's major cities. Many aspects of yellow journalism, such as banner headlines, sensational stories, an emphasis on illustrations, and colored supplements, became a permanent feature of popular newspapers in the United States and Europe during the 20th century.

It was serialized in Kodansha's Weekly Sh≈çnen Magazine from August 2006 to July 2017, with the individual chapters collected and published into 63 tank≈çbon volumes. The story follows the adventures of Natsu Dragneel, a member of the popular wizard guild Fairy Tail, as he searches the fictional world of Earth-land for the dragon Igneel. The manga has been adapted into an anime series produced by A-1 Pictures, Dentsu Inc., Satelight, Bridge, and CloverWorks which was broadcast in Japan on TV Tokyo from October 2009 to March 2013. A second series was broadcast from April 2014 to March 2016. A third and final series aired from October 2018 to September 2019. The series has also inspired numerous spin-off manga, including a prequel by Mashima, Fairy Tail Zero, and a sequel storyboarded by him, titled Fairy Tail: 100 Years Quest. Additionally, A-1 Pictures has developed nine original video animations and two animated feature films. The manga series was originally licensed for an English language release in North America by Del Rey Manga, which began releasing the individual volumes in March 2008 and ended its licensing with the 12th volume release in September 2010. In December 2010, Kodansha USA took over the North American release of the series. The Southeast Asian network Animax Asia aired an English-language version of the anime for seven seasons from 2010 to 2015. The manga was also licensed in the United Kingdom by Turnaround Publisher Services and in Australia by Penguin Books Australia. The anime has been licensed by Funimation for an English-language release in North America. As of February 2020, Fairy Tail had 72 million copies in print. Plot The world of Earth- land is home to numerous guilds where wizards apply their magic for paid job requests. Natsu Dragneel, a Dragon Slayer wizard from the Fairy Tail guild, explores the Kingdom of Fiore in search of his missing adoptive father, the dragon Igneel. During his journey, he befriends a young celestial wizard named Lucy Heartfilia and invites her to join Fairy Tail. Lucy forms a team with Natsu and his cat-like Exceed partner, Happy, which is joined by other guild members: Gray Fullbuster, an ice wizard; Erza Scarlet, a magical knight; and Wendy Marvell and Carla, another Dragon Slayer and Exceed duo. The team embark on numerous missions together, which include subduing criminals, illegal dark guilds, and ancient Etherious demons created by Zeref, a wizard cursed with immortality and deadly power. After several adventures, Natsu and his companions find Zeref living in isolation on Fairy Tail's sacred ground of Sirius Island, where he expresses a desire to die for the atrocities he has committed. A battle over Zeref ensues between Fairy Tail and the dark guild Grimoire Heart, which attracts the attention of the evil black dragon Acnologia. The Fairy Tail wizards survive Acnologia's assault when the spirit of their guild's founder and Zeref's estranged lover, Mavis Vermillion, casts the defensive Fairy Sphere spell that places them into seven years of suspended animation. Later, Fairy Tail wages war against the Etherious dark guild Tartaros, who aim to unseal a book believed to contain E.N.D., Zeref's ultimate demon. When Acnologia returns to annihilate both guilds, Igneel ‚Äì revealed to have sealed himself within Natsu ‚Äì emerges to battle Acnologia, only to be killed in front of a helpless Natsu, who departs on a training journey to avenge Igneel. After Natsu returns one year later, Fiore is invaded by the Alvarez Empire, a military nation ruled by Zeref, who intends to acquire Fairy Heart, a wellspring of infinite magic power housed within Mavis's equally cursed body preserved beneath Fairy Tail's guildhall. While battling Zeref, Natsu is informed of his own identity as both Zeref's younger brother and the true incarnation of E.N.D., whom Zeref resurrected as a demon with the intention of being killed by him. When Natsu fails to do so, Zeref absorbs Fairy Heart from Mavis in a bid to rewrite the present timeline with one where he might prevent his own curse and Acnologia's rise to power. After Natsu defeats Zeref to stop the drastic changes to history his actions would create, Mavis lifts her and Zeref's curse by reciprocating his love, which kills them both. Meanwhile, Fairy Tail and their allies detain Acnologia within a space-time rift created by the use of Eclipse, Zeref's time travel gate. However, Acnologia escapes while his disembodied spirit traps all of the present Dragon Slayers within the rift to maintain his godlike power. Lucy and the other wizards across the continent immobilize Acnologia's body within Fairy Sphere, while Natsu accumulates the other Dragon Slayers' magic and destroys Acnologia's spirit, killing him and freeing the Dragon Slayers from captivity. The following year, Natsu and his team depart on a century-old guild mission, continuing their adventures together. Production After finishing his previous work, Rave Master, Hiro Mashima found the story sentimental and sad at the same time, so he wanted the storyline of his next manga to have a \\"lot of fun.\\" His inspiration for the series was sitting in bars and partying with his friends. He also described the series as being about young people finding their calling, such as a job. Mashima drew a one- shot titled Fairy Tale that was published in Magazine Fresh on September 3, 2002. It is about a guild of couriers and the fire-using spirit protagonist, Natsu, as he carries various things on assignments. But Mashima then came up with the idea to have different types of wizards hanging out in one place, and one idea after the other kept popping into his head, so he practically forced his editor to allow him to change it from couriers to wizards. The title was changed from \\"Tale\\" to \\"Tail\\" in reference to the tail of a fairy; which the author said may or may not prove to be a \\"pivotal point.\\" Mashima stated that while he tried to consider both his own interests and the fans' on what would happen next in Fairy Tail, the fans' took precedence. In the period between Rave Master and Fairy Tail, all but one of Mashima's assistant's left, and the artist said making sure that the three new ones knew what to do was the hardest thing throughout the first year of serialization. Mashima described his weekly schedule for creating individual chapters of Fairy Tail in 2008: script and storyboards were written on Monday, rough sketches the following day, and drawing and inking were done Wednesday through Friday; time in the weekends was for Monster Hunter Orage, a monthly series Mashima was writing at the same time. He usually thought up new chapters while working on the current ones. Mashima had six assistants in 2008 that worked in an area with seven desks, as well as a sofa and TV for video games. In 2011, he stated that he worked six days a week, for 17 hours a day. For the characters of the series, Mashima drew upon people he has known in his life. In establishing the father- son relationship between Natsu and Igneel, Mashima cited his father's death when he was a child as an influence. He took Natsu's motion sickness from one of his friends, who gets sick when they take taxis together. When naming the character, the author thought western fantasy names would be unfamiliar to Japanese audiences, so he went with the Japanese name for summer; Natsu. Mashima based the reporter character Jason on American manga critic Jason Thompson, who interviewed him at 2008's San Diego Comic-Con, and another on an employee from Del Rey Manga, the original North American publisher of Fairy Tail. He based the humorous aspects of the series on his daily life and jokes his assistants would make. Media=Manga Written and illustrated by Hiro Mashima, Fairy Tail was serialized in the manga anthology Weekly Sh≈çnen Magazine from August 2, 2006 to July 26, 2017. The 545 individual chapters were collected and published into 63 tank≈çbon volumes by Kodansha between December 15, 2006 and November 17, 2017. In 2008, a special crossover one-shot between Fairy Tail and Miki Yoshikawa's Flunk Punk Rumble, titled , was published in Weekly Sh≈çnen Magazine. It was later included in Fairy Tail+, an official fanbook released on May 17, 2010. Another crossover with Mashima's first series Rave was published in 2011. A special issue of Weekly Sh≈çnen Magazine, published on October 19, 2013, featured a small crossover between Fairy Tail and Nakaba Suzuki's The Seven Deadly Sins, where each artist drew a yonkoma (four-panel comic) of the other's series. An actual crossover chapter between these two ran in the magazines' combined 4/5 issue of 2014, which was released on December 25, 2013. A two-volume series called Fairy Tail S, which collects short stories by Mashima that were originally published in various Japanese magazines through the years, was released on September 16, 2016. The series was licensed for an English-language release in North America by Del Rey Manga.

Reception=Manga As of February 2020, the Fairy Tail manga had 72 million collected volumes in circulation. According to Oricon, Fairy Tail was the eighth best-selling manga series in Japan for 2009, fourth best in 2010 and 2011, fifth best of 2012, dropped to ninth in 2013, to 17th in 2014, and was 15th in 2015. The fifth volume of Fairy Tail was ranked seventh in a list of the top ten manga, and the series once again placed seventh after the release of the sixth volume. About.com's Deb Aoki listed Fairy Tail as the Best New Sh≈çnen Manga of 2008. It also won the 2009 Kodansha Manga Award for sh≈çnen manga. At the 2009 Industry Awards for the Society for the Promotion of Japanese Animation, the organizers of Anime Expo, Fairy Tail was named Best Comedy Manga. Volume 9 of the series was nominated in the Youth Selection category at the 2010 Angoul√™me International Comics Festival. Reviewing the first volume, Carl Kimlinger of Anime News Network felt Fairy Tail followed standard sh≈çnen action manga tropes, writing \\"the mix of goofy humor, face-crushing action, and teary-eyed sap is so calculated as to be mechanical.\\" Carlo Santos, also of Anime News Network, agreed in his review of volume three; having positive views towards the art, particularly the action scenes, but citing a lack of story and character development. By volume 12 Santos suggested that Mashima's true talent lies in \\"taking the most standard, predictable aspects of the genre and somehow still weaving it into a fun, fist-pumping adventure.\\" Kimlinger, his colleague Rebecca Silverman, and A.E. Sparrow of IGN all felt Mashima's artwork had strong similarities to Eiichiro Oda's in One Piece. While Sparrow used the comparison as a compliment and said it had enough unique qualities of its own, Kimlinger went so far as to say it makes it difficult to appreciate Mashima's \\"undeniable technical skill.\\" Anime The anime has also received a positive response from critics and viewers alike. In Southeast Asia, Fairy Tail won Animax Asia's \\"Anime of the Year\\" award in 2010. In 2012, the anime series won the \\"Meilleur Anime Japonais\\" (best Japanese anime) award and the best French dubbing award at the 19th Anime & Manga Grand Prix in Paris, France. In reviewing the first Funimation Entertainment DVD volumes, Carlo Santos of Anime News Network praised the visuals, characters, and English voice acting, as well as the supporting characters for its comedic approach. However, Santos criticized both the anime's background music and CGI animation. In his review of the second volume, Santos also praised the development of \\"a more substantial storyline,\\" but also criticized the inconsistent animation and original material not present in the manga. In his review of the third volume, Santos praised the improvements of the story and animation, and said that the volume \\"finally shows the [anime] series living up to its potential.\\" In his reviews of the fourth and sixth volumes, however, Santos praised the storyline's formulaic pattern, though saying that \\"unexpected wrinkles in the story [...] keep the action from getting too stale,\\" but calling the outcomes \\"unpredictable\\".

This involves controlled heating an electrically conducting object (usually aluminum foil) by electromagnetic induction, through heat generated in the object by eddy currents. Induction sealing is used in many types of manufacturing. In packaging it is used for package fabrication such as forming tubes from flexible materials, attaching plastic closures to package forms, etc. Probably the most common use of induction sealing is cap sealing, a non-contact method of heating an inner seal to hermetically seal the top of plastic and glass containers. This sealing process takes place after the container has been filled and capped. An induction sealed inner seal Sealing process  Automatic Waterless Induction Sealer An induction sealer with a conveyor The closure is supplied to the bottler with an aluminum foil layer liner already inserted. Although there are various liners to choose from, a typical induction liner is multi-layered. The top layer is a paper pulp that is generally spot-glued to the cap. The next layer is wax that is used to bond a layer of aluminum foil to the pulp. The bottom layer is a polymer film laminated to the foil. After the cap or closure is applied, the container passes under an induction coil, which emits an oscillating electromagnetic field. As the container passes under the induction coil (sealing head) the conductive aluminum foil liner begins to heat due to eddy currents. The heat melts the wax, which is absorbed into the pulp backing and releases the foil from the cap. The polymer film also heats and flows onto the lip of the container. When cooled, the polymer creates a bond with the container resulting in a hermetically sealed product. Neither the container nor its contents are negatively affected, and the heat generated does not harm the contents. It is possible to overheat the foil causing damage to the seal layer and to any protective barriers. This could result in faulty seals, even weeks after the initial sealing process, so proper sizing of the induction sealing is vital to determine the exact system necessary to run a particular product. Sealing can be done with either a hand held unit or on a conveyor system. A more recent development (which suits a small number of applications better) allows for induction sealing to be used to apply a foil seal to a container without the need for a closure. In this case, foil is supplied pre- cut or in a reel. Where supplied in a reel, it is die cut and transferred onto the container neck. When the foil is in place, it is pressed down by the seal head, the induction cycle is activated and the seal is bonded to the container. This process is known as direct application or sometimes \\"capless\\" induction sealing. Reasons that induction sealing may be useful A Hand Held induction sealer There are a variety of reasons companies choose to use induction sealing: * Tamper evidence * Leak prevention * Freshness Retention * Protection against package pilferage * Sustainability * Production Speed  Tamper evidence  With the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations concerning tamper-resistant packaging, pharmaceutical packagers must find ways to comply as outlined in Sec. 450.500 Tamper-Resistant Packaging Requirements for Certain over-the-counter (OTC) Human Drug Products (CPG 7132a.17). Induction sealing systems meet or exceed these government regulations. As stated in section 6 of Packaging Systems: > ‚Äú‚Ä¶6. CONTAINER MOUTH INNER SEALS. Paper, thermal plastic, plastic film, > foil, or a combination thereof, is sealed to the mouth of a container (e.g., > bottle) under the cap. The seal must be torn or broken to open the container > and remove the product. The seal cannot be removed and reapplied without > leaving visible evidence of entry. _Seals applied by heat induction to > plastic containers appear to offer a higher degree of tamper-resistance than > those that depend on an adhesive to create the bond‚Ä¶‚Äù_ Leak prevention/protection  A common application for flat sealing heads are to seal containers in the food and beverage industry to prevent leaks and extend shelf life.Some shipping companies require liquid chemical products to be sealed prior to shipping to prevent hazardous chemicals from spilling on other shipments.  Freshness  Induction sealing keeps unwanted pollutants from seeping into food products, and may assist in extending shelf life of certain products.  Pilferage protection  Induction-sealed containers help prevent the product from being broken into by leaving a noticeable residue on plastic containers from the liner itself. Pharmaceutical companies purchase liners that will purposely leave liner film/foil residue on bottles. Food companies that use induction seals do not want the liner residue as it could potentially interfere with the product itself upon dispensing. They, in turn, put a notice on the product that it has been induction-sealed for their protection; letting the consumer know it was sealed upon leaving the factory and they should check for an intact seal before using.  Sustainability In some applications, induction sealing can be considered to contribute towards sustainability goals by allowing lower bottle weights as the pack relies on the presence of an induction foil seal for its security, rather than a mechanically strong bottle neck and closure. Induction heating analysis Some manufacturers have produced devices which can monitor the magnetic field strength present at the induction head (either directly or indirectly via such mechanisms as pick up coils), dynamically predicting the heating effect in the foil. Such devices provide quantifiable data post-weld in a production environment where uniformity - particularly in parameters such as foil peel-off strength, is important. Analysers may be portable or designed to work in conjunction with conveyor belt systems. High speed power analysis techniques (Voltage and Current measurement in near real time) can be used to intercept power delivery from mains to generator or generator to head in order to calculate energy delivered to the foil and the statistical profile of that process. As the thermal capacity of the foil is typically static, such information as true power, apparent power and power factor may be used to predict foil heating with good relevance to final weld parameters and in a dynamic manner. Many other derivative parameters may be calculated for each weld, yielding confidence in a production environment that is notably more difficult to achieve in conduction transfer systems, where analysis, if present is generally post-weld as relatively large thermal mass of heating and conduction elements combined impair rapid temperature change. Inductive heating with quantitative feedback such as that provided by power analysis techniques further allows for the possibility of dynamic adjustments in energy delivery profile to the target. This opens the possibility of feed-forward systems where the induction generator properties are adjusted in near real- time as the heating process proceeds, allowing for a specific heating profile track and subsequent compliance feedback - something that is not generally practical for conduction heating processes. Benefits of induction vs. conduction sealing Conduction sealing requires a hard metal plate to make perfect contact with the container being sealed. Conduction sealing systems delay production time because of required system warm-up time. They also have complex temperature sensors and heaters. Unlike conduction sealing systems, induction sealing systems require very little power resources, deliver instant startup time, and have a sealing head which can conform to ‚Äúout of specification‚Äù containers when sealing. Induction sealing also offers advantages when sealing to glass: Using a conduction sealer to seal a simple foil structure to glass gives no tolerance or compressibility to allow for any irregularity in the glass surface finish. With an induction sealer, the contact face can be of a compressible material, ensuring a perfect bond each time  Variety of products that use induction sealing  *Pharmaceutical *Nutraceutical *Food *Dairy *Beverage *Cosmetics, health & beauty *Automotive petroleum products *Chemical *Agricultural and ag chem. *Animal care and medicines *Sporting goods supplies *Children‚Äôs toys (clays, bubbles, etc.) *Pastes *Paints *Home remodeling products *Musical instrument supplies (cleaners, resins, lubricants, polishes) *Dental *Personal pleasure products *Hunting / fishing aids *Computer aids/ inks *Laundry detergent /products *Manufacturing shop supplies *School supply products *Inks, dyes, carbon products‚Ä¶. *Condoms  History  Induction Sealing inventor Jack Palmer (circa 1995) *1957-1958 - Original concept and method for Induction Sealing is conceived and proven by Jack Palmer (a process engineer at that time for the FR Corporation - Bronx, NY) as a means of solving liquid leakage from polyethylene bottles during shipment *1960 - U.S. Patent (# 2,937,481) is awarded to Jack Palmer, in which his concept and process of Induction Sealing is made public *Mid-1960s - Induction sealing is used worldwide *1973 ‚Äì First solid state cap sealer introduced *1982 ‚Äì Chicago Tylenol murders *1983 ‚Äì First transistorized air-cooled power supply for induction cap sealing *1985 ‚Äì Universal coil technology debuted *1992 ‚Äì Water-cooled, IGBT-based sealer introduced *1997 ‚Äì Waterless cap sealers introduced (half the size and relatively maintenance free) *2004 ‚Äì 6 kW system introduced  References = Further reading  * Yam, K.

Until about the 1950s moviehouses mainly showed melodramas and westerns, which caused difficulty for Bustillo Oro; his films may have been popular, but they were not necessarily welcome on the big screen. As a result, owing to their outlandish costumes and makeup and their violent nature, his movies were associated with wrestling shows. Lucha libre, the term for professional wrestling in Mexico, became an important part of horror film in Mexico. Writers and producers introduced the spooky aspects of horror films, like vampires, werewolves, and mummies, into the lucha libre films. U.S. producer K. Gordon Murray introduced Mexican horror films to an international audience. Murray acquired nearly seventy Mexican films, with many different genres among the mix and about thirty horror films, and distributed them in the United States. This was only the start of Mexican horror films gaining popularity in other countries. History The Mexican horror film proper came into its own with the release of El fantasma del convento (1934), Dos monjes (1934), and El Misterio del rostro p√°lido (1935), three films from the writer-director Juan Bustillo Oro. Oro is considered by many to be the true Father of the Mexican horror film. He directed more than sixty films over five decades, including El Hombre sin rostro (1950), a film of significant importance in Mexican cinema of the 1950s. Still, as potent and popular as Bustillo Oro's efforts were, Mexican movie houses were overwhelmingly dominated by melodramas and westerns up until the 1950s. On television, lucha libre--professional wrestling-- captivated the country. The sport lent itself well to big-screen adaptations with its costumed heroes and villains, larger-than-life personalities, and impossible feats of strength played straight. Monsters and supernatural storylines complemented these mass-produced wrestling movies perfectly. Numerous lucha libre films incorporated familiar spookery such as vampires, robots, werewolves, and (especially) mummies. In 1953, however, Mexico mounted its first-ever serious treatment of the Frankenstein myth, El Monstruo resucitado. Directed by Chano Urueta, El Monstruo resucitado presents Spanish actor Jos√© Mar√≠a Linares-Rivas as a deranged plastic surgeon who keeps an ape- monster in his basement and successfully reanimates a corpse, albeit as a mindless zombie. El Monstruo resucitado was a success in Mexico. Suddenly, the Western was taking second place on screen to the Horror genre films. Another success La bruja (1954) cast gorgeous Lilia del Valle as a repulsive-looking wretch made beautiful by a scientist who then uses her newfound allure for her own evil ends. Ladr√≥n de cad√°veres (1956), another popular success, is a wrestling film in which a masked combatant receives a brain transplant from a gorilla. It is also noteworthy for being directed by Fernando M√©ndez, who, the following year, redefined the possibilities of Mexican horror films with his landmark masterwork El vampiro (1957). El vampiro is widely considered to be a triumph in the Mexican Horror genre. Often called beautifully directed and photographed, El vampiro featured film actor, movie writer and producer, Abel Salazar in the lead role. Salazar would become one of the key figures of the Mexican horror film wave and shortly after starring in and producing El vampiro he formed ABSA Studios in Mexico. He would go on to co-produce eight more successful horror films between 1957 and 1963. A sensation worldwide, M√©ndez followed El vampiro with El Ata√∫d del Vampiro (1957) and Misterios de ultratumba (1958) (aka The Black Pit of Dr. M), a genuinely horrifying excursion into the unhinged mind of the titular character, who runs an insane asylum by day and ventures into occult recklessness come nightfall. The brain- eating reincarnation romp El Bar√≥n del terror (1961) is seen by its cult fans as one of the most ludicrous movies ever made anywhere. It caught on in the United States under the title The Brainiac, where it remains a much-loved cult object nearly half a century after its release. In 1961, Witch's Mirror came courtesy of director Chano Urueta. Mirror recounts the story of a sorceress who enchants a looking glass to protect her adopted daughter from domestic violence. When her magic fails, the witch embarks on a journey of vengeance. The real life Mexican folk legend of \\"La Llorona\\" (The Crying Woman) supplied the basis for multiple Mexican-made movies, none more polished and effective than The Curse of the Crying Woman (1961). However successful the aforementioned projects may have been in their native country, it took K. Gordon Murray to make them into international sensations. Murray acquired and distributed an estimated sixty-six motion pictures in the United States, including fairy-tale fantasies, adult films, and approximately thirty horror imports, almost all of which came from Mexico. Murray's love of exploitation films and sensational subjects proved a perfect formula for selling his Mexican horror acquisitions. Aside from films like The Brainiac and other legitimate classics such as El vampiro and Witch's Mirror, Murray's theatrical showings included Mu√±ecos infernales / The Curse of the Doll People (1960); The Robot vs. The Aztec Mummy (1957) plus its sequel Wrestling Women vs. the Aztec Mummy (1964). He also churned out two of the most popular wrestling imports, Samson vs. the Vampire Women / Santo contra las mujeres vampiro, (1962) and Samson in the Wax Museum / Santo en el museo de cera(1963), a perfect pair of showcases for Santo, one of Mexico's most beloved masked wrestlers. Working out of Coral Gables, Florida, Murray oversaw the rewriting and overdubbing of all his imports at a tiny studio called Soundlab Inc., which was, in fact, one of the first facilities in the U.S. to focus effectively on reworking foreign films for English-speaking audiences. Meanwhile, back in Mexico, director Ren√© Cardona had covered nearly every genre imaginable as a writer, director, and actor. In 1969 he tore into horror anew with Night of the Bloody Apes (also known as La Horripilante bestia humana). The Americanized dubbed version of Cardona's cult film boasts genuine footage of open-heart surgery, occasionally hilarious betrayals of the movie's minuscule budget (including fake grass that moves when stepped on), and some genuinely harrowing violence. Throughout the 1970s, American horror films evolved in new directions and shattered virtually every conceivable taboo on screen. This was a relatively dormant period for Mexican scare fare. The young Guillermo del Toro spent those years awash in horror cinema from all over the globe. After helming two lauded shorts, Do√±a Lupe (1985) and Geometria (1987), along with multiple episodes of the horror TV series La Hora Marcada, del Toro rose to prominence with his international arthouse sensation Cronos (1993), a tale of a cursed antique device and its demonic promise of eternal life. Since then, the Guadalajara-born del Toro has interspersed the Hollywood blockbusters Mimic (1997), Blade II (2002), and Hellboy (2004) with the Spanish-language The Devil's Backbone (2001) and Pan's Labyrinth (2006). Along with Texas native Robert Rodriguez, whose From Dusk Till Dawn (1996) ignited a new fascination with Aztec mythology and blood rituals, Guillermo del Toro is serving to keep Mexican horror cinema alive.

It was created by Maira Kalman and Rick Meyerowitz who did the actual painting, and is (according to the American Society of Magazine Editors) #14 on the list of the top 40 magazine covers of the past 40 years. It depicts the boroughs of New York City, as well as individual neighborhoods within the city, giving each a humorous name (a \\"funny mixture of Yiddish, Persian, and New Yorkisms\\") based on the history or geography of that area of the city, while playfully using names or suffixes common in the Middle East and Central Asia, such as \\"-stan\\". Thus the title, \\"New Yorkistan\\". The cover gained unexpected popularity, with the New Yorker making approximately $400,000 by February 2002 by selling copies of the picture as signed lithographs (all 750 copies of which sold out within 4 days) and unsigned posters. According to Kalman, the inspiration for the cover arose in a car on the way to a party. She and Meyerowitz were talking about tribalism. At one point she came up with the idea of \\"Bronxistan\\", to which Meyerowitz replied \\"You know, we've got a map here.\\" Originally, the picture was to be run on the back page of the magazine, but editors liked it so much that it was decided to make it the cover picture. Susan Jarratt describes the cover as \\"lampooning both New Yorkers' city-bound geographic consciousness and a nationwide ignorance of the geography of Central Asia\\". Jarratt notes that it was one of the first \\"humorous interventions\\" since the events of September 11, 2001. Urschel notes that this timing of the cover's publication was fortunate. Kalman herself commented on the timing, saying that \\"if [the cover had come] out earlier, many would have been infuriated, and if it [had come] out later, no one would have cared.\\"   Place names  The places depicted, with their explanations (according to the artists or to commentators), are as follows: ; : Rikers Island, a large jail complex ; : Alzheimer's disease ; : Situated in the Theater District, this is a play on the term \\"artsy-fartsy\\", as well as a reference to the Farsi language, which is the official language of Afghanistan. ; ; ; : The Upper East Side where \\"everyone can afford Manolo Blahnik shoes\\" ; : Botox ; : The Bronx ; : Bulimics ; : Central Park, Manhattan ; : Jersey City, home of a Muslim community where women wear a chador.

History First opened in 1988 on Willow Street in downtown Syracuse, the restaurant subsequently opened locations in older buildings of historical significance in several cities. The Syracuse location used to be N&H; tavern, and once housed a Cadillac dealership. The Rochester restaurant is a former Lehigh Valley Railroad station overlooking the Genesee River. The Buffalo restaurant is a former Universal Pictures film storage vault. The Brooklyn restaurant had been a tool & die shop and the Newark location was once a boxing club where Rubin Carter trained, Stamford was a Yale Lock Co. factory. A cookbook with many of the restaurant's recipes was published titled Dinosaur Bar-B-Que: An American Roadhouse in 2001. In late November 2006, the Syracuse location was affected by the Norovirus and was closed for about a week until cleared to reopen by county health inspectors. Hundreds of customers and employees were affected. It is unclear how the virus materialized. Onondaga County health inspectors did not find fault on the part of the restaurant. In May 2009, Dinosaur Bar-B-Que was voted America's best barbecue in ABC's Good Morning America poll. Approximately 4000 out of the 7500 participants in the poll chose Dinosaur Bar-B-Que. Adam Richman, host of the Travel Channel's Man v. Food, took the show to Syracuse (season 3, episode 13) on June 8, 2010. Dinosaur Bar-B-Que was the first stop for Richman, who tried the restaurant's \\"Pork-Sket\\" sandwich (which features 1/2 pound each of brisket and pulled pork). It was first broadcast on the Travel Channel on September 1, 2010. In March 2015, a New York City law firm filed a class action lawsuit against Dinosaur Bar-B-Que, claiming the chain systematically underpaid its tipped workers. The firm, Fitapelli & Schaffer, has filed similar lawsuits on behalf of workers at T.G.I. Friday's and Chipotle.

The goal of the organization was described by Ashton Hawkins as \\"informing the public on arts issues.\\" Ashton Hawkins, \\"Preface\\" in Who Owns the Past? Cultural Policy, Cultural Property and the Law. Kate Fitz Gibbon, ed. New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press, co-published with the American Council for Cultural Policy, 2005: p. ix. The organization is now defunct and its website (culturalpolicycouncil.org) has been removed from the web. Some of its members now actively take part in Cultural Policy Research Institute. The organization has been famous for its views on heritage issues and advocating the lawful circulation of antiquities in a regulated trade that balances the interests of national heritage, archeological preservation and the international interest in cultural exchange by museum loans and the private market. ACCP's treasurer William Pearlstein has described Middle Eastern cultural heritage laws (especially those of Iraq) as \\"retentionist\\" and expressed a desire for the possibility of circulation of licensed exported antiquities.Andrew Lawler, \\"Impending War Stokes Battle Over Fate of Iraqi Antiquities\\" (Science 31 January 2003: Vol. 299. no. 5607, p. 643) Some Archaeologists, academics, and cultural heritage lawyers have found these statements worrisome, as the members of ACCP are politically influential figures. Archaeological Institute of America's code of ethics maintain that its members \\"refuse to participate in the trade in undocumented antiquities and refrain from activities that enhance the commercial value of such objects. Undocumented antiquities are those that are not documented as belonging to a public or private collection before December 30, 1970, when the AIA Council endorsed the UNESCO Convention on Cultural Property, or that have not been excavated and exported from the country of origin in accordance with the laws of that country.\\" (Source: AIA official webpage) It is widely believed by many academics that the trade and collectorship of antiquities fuel the looting and destruction of archaeological sites around the world.See e.g. Colin Renfrew, Loot, legitimacy and ownership: the ethical crisis in archaeology. London: Duckworth, 2000. Also more recently Neil Brodie and Colin Renfrew, \\"Looting and the world's archaeological heritage: the inadequate response\\" Annual Review of Anthropology 34 (2005) 43-61. History and the structure of the group According to published news reports and its own website, the ACCP was directed by Ashton Hawkins, former executive vice-president and Counsel to the Trustees of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The group had its inaugural meeting with a 45-people Board of Advisers on 9 October 2002. According to an Art Newspaper article (see below), among them were the antiquities collector Shelby White (see Leon Levy), the former Getty curator Arthur Houghton (a vice-president), the former Kimbell Art Museum director Edmund Pillsbury, and the legal scholar Prof John Merryman. Several lawyers from major museums were also there. William Pearlstein was the treasurer of the group and has also represented the National Association of Dealers in Ancient, Oriental and Primitive Art. Ashton Hawkins, former lawyer of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and current president of ACCP was reported in the Art Newspaper article as stating the following: \\"We believe that legitimate dispersal of cultural material through the market is one of the best ways to protect it. We're interested in the protection of culture as much as the protection of legitimate collecting.\\".See David D'Arcy, \\"Legal group to fight \\"retentionist\\" policies.\\" Art Newspaper. October 24, 2002 The ACCP's board of directors included President Ashton Hawkins, Vice President Arthur Houghton, Treasurer William Pearlstein, Educational coordinator Kate Fitz Gibbon and Secretary Arielle Kozloff. American invasion of Iraq and activities of ACCP The council appeared in the forefront of cultural heritage protection debates during the American 2003 invasion of Iraq. A 2003 article in Science discusses Ashton and Pearlstein's advocacy for \\"liberalization\\" in the issuance of foreign-dig permits in Iraq and reconsideration of Iraqi cultural heritage laws to allow ‚Äúsome objects [to be] certified for export.\\"Andrew Lawler, \\"Impending War Stokes Battle Over Fate of Iraqi Antiquities\\" (Science 31 January 2003: Vol. 299. no. 5607, p. 643) On ACCP's activities concerning Iraqi cultural heritage, Zainab Bahrani's article \\"Looting and Conquest\\" The Nation, May 26, 2003 takes a critical counter-position. Bahrani wrote that ‚ÄúWilliam Pearlstein, of the American Council for Cultural Policy (ACCP), an organization that met with the White House and the Pentagon right before the [Iraq] war and right after the looting [of the National Museum of Iraq], is appealing for the cultural theft to continue by other means, calling Iraq's antiquities-preservation laws \\"retentionist,\\" and saying he \\"hoped that Iraq would grant more excavation permits and consider export permits for redundant objects.\\" She adds that such ‚Äúopportunism opens the door to more cultural and historical plunder, a base scramble much like the parceling off of sites and antiquities that occurred in the nineteenth century.‚Äù Publications ACCP Advisory Board member Kate Fitz Gibbon, who served on the Cultural Property Advisory Committee to the US President from 2000‚Äî2003, has recently edited a book entitled Who owns the past: Cultural Policy, Cultural Property, and the Law (Rutgers University Press 2005), which mostly features contributors affiliated with ACCP (e.g. William Pearlstein, Shelby White, Kate Fitz Gibbon etc.), and intends to propagate the legitimacy of \\"the ability of museums and private collectors [in the US] to own art from other countries\\" in the public opinion. Jean M. Borgatti (Clark University) published a favorable account of this book on H-Net reviews. According to Borgatti, the book in the overall sense critiques what they call \\"retentive cultural nationalisms\\" of \\"source-nations\\" who insist that archaeological artifacts should remain in the country of origin. The authors of the book present themselves as \\"cultural internationalists\\" who consider ancient artifacts as works of art that need to be circulated (in the antiquities market, Western museums, among Western collectors) to promote a \\"cultural understanding\\". Cultural property is internationally protected by the Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict and the UNESCO Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property.

It is one of the smallest parishes in the county.  History  Very little has been found from prehistoric times except for a cup and ring marked stone at Hunters Hill. It had an extraordinary range of symbols carved on it and is our only clue to the people who lived here in the Neolithic. Nafferton Castle There is a big gap in the evidence for the rest of the prehistoric period, as well as the Roman and early medieval periods. The next hint of life in the parish comes in medieval times. Ovington Hall has some 14th-century stonework in its outbuildings and may have an old building at its core. To the north on the west bank of the Whittle Burn adjacent to the A69 are the vestiges of the medieval Nafferton Castle. At a time when northern England was suffering the ravages of war with Scotland, Ovington seems to have escaped without mention. Likewise, it has no trace of the 16th and 17th century defensive farmhouses, called bastles, that are found elsewhere in the county. The earliest buildings in Ovington seem to have been built in the 16th and 17th centuries. Village Farm may be one of the earliest and, although it is a little like a bastle, its walls are much thinner and would not have withstood any prolonged attack. Hunter's Cottage is another 17th or 18th century farm and is a rare survival of an earlier type of farm. The 18th and 19th centuries were a fairly prosperous time for the border region of England and fine buildings such as Ovington Hall were built. As well as developments in farm methods and practice, new industries developed, such as brewing at the Old Brewery.  Governance  Ovington is in the parliamentary constituency of Hexham.  Geography  Whittle dean is a deep woody dell which stretches southwards & joins the Tyne east of Ovington. The waters of this dean (peculiarly soft & clear) are the most celebrated in the north of England for whitening linen cloth. Mr. William Newton's bleach green, situated on this stream at the confluence of the Tyne is known and famed throughout all these northern parts. (Mackenzie 1825). The Whittle Burn can be traced back to the present day Whittledean Water Works on either side of the Roman Wall near Welton Hall.

Honda won ten 500cc World Championships with the NSR500 from 1984 to 2002, with six in a row from 1994 to 1999. With more than 100 wins to its credit, the NSR500 is the most dominant force in modern Grand Prix motorcycle racing. The 1989 NSR500 that won Honda's third 500 World Championship with Eddie Lawson exemplifies the overwhelming power, acceleration and raw speed that has always been synonymous with Honda's 500 cc two-stroke V4. 1984-1987 Designed to succeed Honda's first two-stroke Grand Prix racer, the NS500 triple, NSR500 debuted in 1984 for the Grand Prix motorcycle racing's 500 cc class. Building on lessons learned from its three- cylinder predecessor, the new V4 used a single crankshaft, making it lighter and more compact than its dual-crankshaft adversaries. Though tormented by unorthodox chassis technology in its first season, the NSR500 evolved to clinch Honda's second 500 cc GP title in 1985. Opening the V-angle to 112 degrees in 1987 made room for a quartet of 36 mm Keihin carburetors between the cylinders where they could be fed more cool air. The new arrangement also let the engine exhale more efficiently through its four artfully intertwined expansion chambers. By year's end, Honda won a third 500 World Championship with Australian rider Wayne Gardner. 1988-1989 Entirely redesigned for 1988, the NSR500 got a stiffer, twin-spar aluminium chassis and various engine changes. The changes made to the 1988 bike made it somewhat problematic for the riders, especially in the first half of the season. Wayne Gardner had a hard time in defence of his 1987 World Championship and although he eventually got on top of the bike's problems and won three races in a row in mid-season (Dutch TT, Belgium and Yugoslavia), he could only finish second in the championship behind the Yamaha of Eddie Lawson. The main complaints about the 1988 NSR500 was that the engine, while undoubtedly the most powerful in 500cc racing, was very 'peaky' and had to run up high in the rev range to get the best out of it. Also the suspension geometry of the bike wasn't as good as in 1987 and the bike was noticeably harder to handle through the turns than the rival Yamaha YZR500 and Suzuki's new RGV500. While the engine's power advantage was seen on the faster tracks such as Suzuka (which is actually owned by Honda), Assen, Spa and Paul Ricard, on tighter tracks such as Jarama and Jerez it was off the pace due to its handling. More improvements gave the 1989 NSR500 upwards of at 12,000 rpm ‚Äî essentially doubling the output of the 1966 Honda RC181 Grand Prix four-stroke. Capable of well over , the 1989 bikes had more top speed and acceleration than anything else on the track. To contain all that muscle, the stiffer, twin-spar aluminum chassis used a curved, gull-wing-type swingarm to accommodate more efficient expansion chambers. The result was an unforgiving, but brutally fast, package that earned Honda a fourth 500 cc World Championship in 1989 thanks to Eddie Lawson who had joined the factory backed Rothmans team alongside Gardner and young Australian Mick Doohan.Honda NSR500 - GP Racing History 1990-1998 Though the 499 cc V-4 could produce more than , chassis development, sophisticated engine management and an Australian named Mick Doohan made the NSR500 a legend in the 1990s. Extensive testing in 1991 led to a new aluminum chassis patterned on the successful RVF750 endurance racer. Honda unveiled a revolutionary idea with a 1992 V4 that was timed to fire all four cylinders within 65-70 degrees of crankshaft rotation ‚Äî the so-called \\"Big-Bang\\" engine. Along with a balance shaft that neutralized the single crankshaft engine's gyroscopic effects, the 1992 NSR500 was a breakthrough. Emphasizing acceleration over sheer speed, Doohan used this engine to win five of the first seven 500 Grand Prix races of 1992. Although a badly broken leg denied Doohan's bid for the 1992 World Championship, he would not be denied for long. Beginning in 1994, Doohan and the NSR500 won five consecutive 500 cc World Championships. Winning 12 of 15 races in 1997, he broke a single-season win record that was set in 1972. Combining for 54 total 500 Grand Prix wins, no man and machine in modern history had dominated the 500 World Championship so thoroughly. From around 1997, the NSR500 again featured the older \\"Screamer\\" engine in some factory racers, with Mick Doohan preferring the higher outright power of this design despite it being much more difficult to harness. 1999-2002 Constant development and ever-increasing sophistication sharpened the NSR500's edge, earning Honda two more 500 World Championships, with √Älex Crivill√© in 1999 and again with Valentino Rossi in 2001. For the 2002 season, technical regulations for the World Championship motorcycle road racing 500 cc class were changed drastically, with four-stroke engines being allowed to grow up to 990 cc and up to six cylinders. The name of the class was changed to MotoGP and was limited to race prototypes only. Because of these changes, Honda introduced the RC211V in 2002 to race alongside the NSR500. The larger displacement RC211V and other four-stroke bikes dominated the series and the NSR500 was eventually phased out of the class along with all other two-stroke motorcycles.

Close collaborator of popes Pius VII and Gregory XVI, he renounced his titles in order to become a Jesuit in 1838. He was born in Rome to a family of nobles. His father, Baldassare, was Duke of Sirmio and a prince of the Holy Roman Empire, and his mother was named Valeria Caterina Giustiniani. After being educated at home by his father, Odescalchi studied in Hungary from 1798 to 1800, and he earned doctorates in civil and canon law in 1809. He received the clerical tonsure in 1797 and was eventually ordained to the priesthood on 31 December 1808, celebrating his first Mass on the next day, 1 January. After becoming acquainted with Joseph Pignatelli and following Pope Pius VII's restoration of the Society of Jesus, he planned on entering the Society but failed due to the resistance of his sister Vittoria, who desperately sought to live near her brother. Pius VII himself agreed with Vittoria and promised Carlo that he could enter at a more appropriate time, but after Vittoria's marriage three years later, Pius decided to keep Carlo and appointed him the papal auditor. Pius VII, following his release from France, sent Odescalchi to Olomouc in 1815 as a papal legate to Anton√≠n Colloredo-Waldsee, and again in 1819 to bestow the cardinalatial red biretta on Rudolf von Habsburg-Lotharingen. From 1815 to 1820, Odescalchi served as auditor of the Sacra Rota Romana for Austria, auditor of the pope, and canon of St. Peter's Basilica. On 10 March 1823, Pius VII appointed Odescalchi the Archbishop of Ferrara and also created him Cardinal Priest with the title of Santi Apostoli. Odescalchi was consecrated a bishop on the following 25 May by Cardinal Giulio Maria della Somaglia, with Cardinals Giuseppe della Porta Rodiani and Lorenzo Mattei serving as co-consecrators. He served as the papal legate for the opening of the holy door of the Lateran Basilica in the 1825 Holy Year. Odescalchi resigned as Archbishop of Ferrara on 2 July 1826. He was then named the Prefect of the Congregation of Bishops and Regulars on 5 February 1828. He was later appointed to two cardinal's posts on 15 April 1833: Cardinal Bishop of Sabina (which he resigned on 30 November 1838, along with the post of Prefect of Bishops and Regulars) and Cardinal Priest of San Lorenzo in Damaso (which he resigned on 19 December 1834). In 1837, Odescalchi submitted to Pope Gregory XVI his resignation from all his offices to enter the Society of Jesus, but the Pope refused. Appointed Grand Prior of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta in Rome, he again asked the Pope to accept his resignation, which Gregory did this time. After abdicating his cardinalate and episcopate in 1838, Odescalchi finally entered the Jesuit Order on 6 December; he took the habit on the following 8 December and professed his vows on 2 February 1840. For three years he was much in demand for spiritual retreats to the clergy and rural missions in the Northern part of Italy. He died at the age of 56, at 10:30 a.m., in a Jesuit school in Modena. The correspondence that followed his death suggests that many considered him a saint. Odescalchi, who ordained Gioacchino Pecci (the future Pope Leo XIII) a priest in 1837, participated in the conclaves of 1823, 1829, and 1830-31. His beatification process was commenced in 1927, and remains open.

It was founded in 1963 by John Calder, John Malcolm, Jim Haynes and Richard Demarco seeking to extend the spirit of the Festival throughout the year. The Traverse Theatre commissions and develops new plays or adaptations from contemporary playwrights. It also presents many productions from visiting companies from across the UK. These include new plays, adaptations, dance, physical theatre, puppetry and contemporary music. The Traverse is a pivotal venue in Edinburgh, particularly during the Edinburgh Festivals in August. It is also the home of the manipulate Visual Theatre Festival and the Edinburgh International Children's Festival (previously Imaginate Festival). History The Traverse Theatre began as a theatre club in 15 James Court, Lawnmarket, Edinburgh, a former doss-house and brothel also known as Kelly's Paradise and Hell's Kitchen. It was \\"a long, low-ceilinged first-floor room barely 15ft wide by 8ft high\\"Dean Gallery (2008) Focus on Demarco. Edinburgh: Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art with 60 seats salvaged from the Palace Cinema placed in two blocks on either side of the stage. The theatre is named because Terry Lane mistakenly believed that the staging arrangement is called 'traverse'; he later realised that it is 'transverse' but it was already too well known to change it. In its first year of operation, a theatre conference was organised by director Jim Haynes, John Calder and Kenneth Tynan and included a happening involving Allan Kaprow among others. The first performance was on 2 January 1963. Following a surveyor's report in March 1969 which stated that the internal floors of James Court were unsafe, the Traverse moved to a former sailmakers's loft at 112 West Bow in the east end of the Grassmarket. This larger space had a 100-seat theatre with flexible seating configurations. The first performance in this venue was on 24 August 1969. In its early days the theatre included exhibition space for the visual arts, until 1966 when the administrators for that space ‚Äì including Richard Demarco ‚Äì moved away to establish what became the Richard Demarco Gallery. Current Traverse Theatre building Cambridge Street, with the Usher Hall on the right In 1992, the Traverse moved to its current location, 10 Cambridge Street, a ¬£3.3 million purpose-built two theatre space with bar caf√© created as part of Saltire Court development on Castle Terrace. The theatre's first performance at this location was on 3 July 1992. Traverse 1 is the larger space with flexible seating that can be moved to create many different configurations (e.g. transverse, end on, in the round, etc.). The most common configuration is 'end on' and has 214 seats. Traverse 2 is the smaller studio space. New flexible seating was installed in September 2005 to allow for different staging configurations and the average capacity is approximately 100 seats. The Traverse and the Edinburgh Festivals Founded in 1963 by John Calder, Jim Haynes and Richard Demarco, the mission of the Traverse was to continue the spirit of the Edinburgh Festivals all year round. During the Festivals in August, the Traverse continues to present cutting edge new writing, as well as new work of all kinds to an international audience. The Traverse is occasionally referred to as 'The Fringe venue that got away', reflecting its current status as a permanent and integral part of the Edinburgh arts scene throughout the year. Today August remains the busiest time for the Traverse. In 2010, in a first for Scottish theatre, a series of specially commissioned rehearsed readings by Enda Walsh, Linda McLean, David Eldridge, Simon Stephens and Marina Carr were broadcast live on 23 August 2010 to cinemas across the UK. One third of 2010 Scotsman Fringe First Award winners were shows performed at the Traverse. Theatre critic Lyn Gardner has described the Traverse's programme as \\"the backbone to the Fringe programme. What you see there will often set the tone and tenor of the rest of the Fringe.\\" Notable associations From its beginning in 1963, the Traverse Theatre has launched the careers of many of Scotland's best-known writers including John Byrne, Gregory Burke, David Greig, David Harrower and Liz Lochhead. During the 1960s Richard Wilson was a regular performer. Throughout the 1970s the Traverse Theatre hosted actors including Timothy Dalton, Billy Connolly, Robbie Coltrane, Simon Callow, Bill Paterson and Steven Berkoff. In 1978 David Hayman famously directed John Byrne's Slab Boys which featured Robbie Coltrane. Tilda Swinton and Forbes Masson memorably performed during the 1980s and Steve Unwin directed Alan Cumming in a 1988 production of The Conquest of the South Pole. Ashley Jensen and Bill Nighy began their acting careers at the Traverse. Many of the theatre's sponsored seats have personalised plaques, including Robbie Coltrane's \\"This is a no farting zone\\" and Tom Conti's \\"In memory of my longest dry\\".

The knife, which was real, had caught in the folds of her costume and had gone into her side. The actress went on with the rest of the performance and was seen to at the end by a doctor who had been in the audience and later taken to hospital. John Martin (co-founder of the Traverse and an early chairman of the board) says that the real knife was used because the space was so small and the audience sat so close to the stage a fake knife would have been detected. Richard Demarco says it was because they had no money and could not afford a paper one. * Throughout 1965 the Traverse Theatre Club was threatened with police raids due to open homosexual activity in a time when it was illegal. * At the 1967 Edinburgh Festival, twenty-two Traverse Theatre shows were performed; including Rochelle Owens' Futz! which the Daily Express described as \\"Filth on the Fringe\\", and Alfred Jarry's Ubu in Chains which featured Ma and Pa Ubu as 6-foot tall sexual organs. * At a meeting in 1971 Artistic Director Michael Rudman persuaded the Edinburgh Corporation to increase the Traverse grant but refused to give any assurances on the 'decency' of future productions.McMillan, Joyce (1988).

Development In the late 1940s, the Radioplane Company developed a set of prototypes of the Q-1 target series, which used pulsejet or small turbojet engines. Although the Q-1 series was not put into production as a target, it did evolve into the USAF RP-54D / XB-67 / XGAM-67 Crossbow anti-radar missile, which was first flown in 1956. It was also considered as a platform for reconnaissance, electronic countermeasures, and decoy roles. The Crossbow had a cigar-shaped fuselage, straight wings, a straight twin-fin tail, and an engine inlet under the belly. It was powered by a Continental J69 turbojet engine, with 4.41 kN (450 kgf/1,000 lbf) thrust. Two Crossbows could be carried by a Boeing B-50 Superfortress bomber, while four Crossbows could be carried by a Boeing B-47 Stratojet bomber. The Crossbow's speed was not enough to allow it to get far ahead of the launching bomber before it ran out of fuel. Only 14 Crossbows were built before the program was cancelled in 1957, in favor of the Longbow, essentially a supersonic version of the same concept. Longbow was eventually cancelled as well. None of the alternative roles were taken up either, with all work on the concept ending in 1960. However, it did point the way to the range of missions that would be performed by UAVs in later decades.

The station is situated at a junction between the Brovary Avenue and the Rayisa Okipna Street, and is actually above ground level with the platform being on the flyover. Two vestibules are on ground level with exits on the southern side of the station. Thereby passengers have to ascend to reach the Metro. Designed by architects I. Maslenkov, and V. Bogdanovsky, the station features a standard Kyivan surface level design that is almost identical to both of its neighbours and is fully reminiscent of the 1960s policy on Soviet public architecture--a single platform with one hinged concrete roof supported by light blue tiled pillars, with decorative flower ceramics at the top. The station serves the Livoberezhna microdistrict, as well as many of the northern adjacent districts, commuters from which use urban transport to arrive. In the prospective future, the station shall be a future transfer to a planned line, Livoberezhna.  Eurovision Song Contest 2017  On February 18, 2017, the station was temporarily closed, due to the reconstruction to the Eurovision Song Contest. On March 23, the renovated eastern vestibule was opened, which was radically different from the earlier sketches. Many Kyivans were dissatisfied with the repairs carried out. The finally restored station was opened on May 5.

Garden In the 1830s, plantations of beech and Monterey pine were planted near the house, and paths were surfaced by pebbles from Loe Bar, near Helston. Extensive colourful gardens including a sweeping hydrangea- flanked drive to a Georgian manor house (not open to the public). There are herbaceous walled gardens and a potager with vegetables and picking flowers; three lakes in a valley planted with ornamental grasses, perennials and South African flowers; an exotic mysterious quarry lake; traditional rhododendrons, azaleas and many Spring bulbs. The gardens are promoted by the Campaign to Protect Rural England.Members Guide 2012, published by CPRE, 2012 House The house was built in the 1780s, being possibly designed by William Wood, a pupil of the Greenwich architect Thomas Edwards. The building is Grade II* listed. It is a substantial late eighteenth century granite house with a basement and two storeys. The facade has five windows on the upper storey and four on the ground floor, with a central door. Eight wide steps ascend to the doorway which has a rusticated surround and a fanlight above. The Venetian window above the door is arched and is flanked by two side windows. The pediment is capped by four stone pillars each topped by a stone ball. In his Buildings of England: Cornwall, the German/British scholar of the history of architecture, Nikolaus Pevsner, describes the building as \\"exceptionally elegant\\".Buildings of England: Cornwall by Nikolaus Pevsner, 2nd edition revised by Enid Radcliffe; Yale 1970 . page 62 - Article on Cury. These remarks are credited to G.M. Trinick, not Pevsner, himself (Footnote, p 62). History Sir John Langdon Bonython told The Literary Digest: \\"Bonython is a Cornish name and the accent is on the second syllable: Bon-y'thon, y as in spy. The ancient family located at Bonython in the Lizard district at a very early period. Existing deeds show that Stephen Bonython was in possession of the family lands in 1277.\\"Charles Earle Funk, What's the Name, Please?, Funk & Wagnalls, 1936. His family had left Bonython Manor in the seventeenth century, having previously lived in the area for over one thousand years. The manor had passed to the St Agnes Donnithorne family before then; some had emigrated to South Australia in the nineteenth century after Nicholas Donnithorne became bankrupt. The family name Bonython had changed phonetically several times over the centuries, and various descendants had spelled it in different ways, including the Donnithorne family of St Agnes which had split off in about 1500.

The Greek name comes probably from the Italian game Biribara, or Biribisso, or Biribi, even if this game is totally different (more similar to the roulette).New pronouncing and explanatory English-Italian and Italian-English dictionary pg. 104, John Millhouse, Ferdinando Bracciforti It is played by two to six players, with two decks and 4 Jokers comprising 108 cards. If 6 players play, one more deck and two jokers more are added. Biriba can also be played by three players with or without partnership rules.  Basics  While there are many variations of Biriba, the basic rules and objective are the same. The player to the right of the dealer shuffles the cards and his partner cuts the deck (the starting dealer is selected by a random draw, the lowest card winning the privilege to receive cards and play first.) Eleven cards are dealt to each player while two other sets of 11 cards are also dealt by one of the opponents and put face down to the side. These cards (two secondary 11-card hands) are called Paketa (\\"packages\\" or \\"parcels\\") or Biribakia (Greek for \\"small Biribas\\".) The objective of the game is to be the first player or team to surpass a pre- determined point total (commonly 2,500 or 3,000, based on the number of players.) Points are tabulated at the end of each round of play from the tableau played by each player/team. Play proceeds counter-clockwise; each player begins their turn by either drawing one single card from the deck, or collecting all of the cards in the discard pile. After drawing, the player may lay cards down in sets of at least three (either suited runs or groups of like-numbered cards.) Jokers and 2s (known as \\"balladaires\\") are wild and may substitute for any card in such a set, and even be repositioned within that set. For instance, a player may lay down the four, five, and seven of hearts, with the two of clubs substituting for the six of hearts. If the player later draws the six of hearts, she may lay it in its correct position and move the two of clubs into the position of the three or the eight. Each set (except for sets composed entirely of twos) may only contain one wild card, whether joker or deuce, although an in-suit two in its natural position does not count as wild or dirty. Once played, sets may not be connected or withdrawn back to the hand, and individual cards may not be removed from the table (therefore, any group dirtied with a joker or a non-suited two can never become clean.) The players complete their turns by placing one card from their hand into the discard pile (players can take no action and play no cards when it is not their turn.) When a player has melded all of the cards from his or her initial hand he then receives the top-most Paketo. If the player did not have to discard to empty their hand, they may continue play with their new cards; otherwise, their turn is complete and they must wait. The next goal is to \\"close\\" the round by emptying their second hand. The player who ends the round receives an additional 100 points. However the player must meet three conditions to close out: the player must have played at least one valid biriba, they must be able to discard a card, and if their hand is reduced to one card and the discard pile contains only one card they may not draw that card, connect either the new or held card, and discard. Points are calculated at the end of each round, and if no player or team has won another round is played with dealership and right-to-receive passed to the left. No information (other than score) is retained between rounds; new hands are dealt and a new atout is determined. Sets Below are the following sets in Biriba. Sets are either arranged the way a straight flush is arranged in Poker or by using the same numbers or face cards. Biriba: a group containing at least seven cards. If the set is consecutive suited cards then it is worth 200 points if there are no jokers (kathari, which is Greek for \\"clean\\", also Gnisia (pure) and Parthena (virgin)) are worth 100 points if there is a joker or a wild two (vromiki, (dirty) or bastardemeni (bastard)). If the set is of like-numbers (seven threes, for instance,) then the Biriba is worth 300 points. However, if a joker or wild two are used in the meld then the value of the Biriba is halved, i.e. 150 points. Hiliara: A hiliara (Greek for \\"thousand\\") consists of every suited consecutive card from Ace to King (or Ace to Two if the Ace is placed after the King). This set is worth 1,000 points. However, if it is dirtied then it is considered a Pentakosara (Greek for \\"five hundred\\") and it is worth 500 points. (see Venezuelan Version at the end of the Greek directions) Set Variations: In some parts of Cyprus a dirtied hiliara (pentakosara) biriba is not worth anything more than 100 (instead of 500) even though the statistical possibility of getting a pentakosara is very low meaning it should be worth more than 100. This variation together with others that downplay points from specific game sets makes the game more luck oriented instead of strategy oriented. Atout The suit of the first revealed card becomes the \\"atout\\" suit (in case of a joker, the receiving player may choose a suit or declare no-trump.) A clean biriba is formed with this suit is worth 600 points rather than 200; a dirty atout biriba is halved to 300 points. This presents a focus both for aggressive and defensive play; atout cards (especially the middle cards, 7 through 10,) are rarely voluntarily discarded, and all atout cards are guarded if an opponent is suspected of collecting them or nearing completion of a biriba. The rare hiliara biriba is still 1000 points (no extra points). Vulnerability If a player or team starts a round past a certain points threshold they may not lay down cards until the total of the first play surpasses a certain points value: for a score between 1000 - 1499 the played sets must be worth at least 75 points, and between 1500 - 2999 points the restriction is raised to 90 points. Card values After all the points from the sets are added (or subtracted if necessary), the points of each individual cards are added to the total score. Each card is assigned a numerical point as follows. Joker: 20 A: 15 K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8 and 2: 10 7, 6, 5, 4, 3: 5 Suits have no effect on the point value of each card. :Note: Biriba has so many variations that even the point system varies by a factor of 10. Below the non-decimal points are used as they are deemed more convenient. See below. Bonus and Penalty points If a player manages to discard his paketo then the round ends and he gets a bonus of 100 points. Everyone else is penalized by adding the points of the cards they have in hands. If a player has not progressed to the biribakia, being still in the first hand, he is penalized another 100 points (in the case that the round ends after a player has acquired a Biribaki, but before he or she has had a chance to play the hand, the total penalty is 100 points for the un-played hand, regardless of the point totals of the cards contained within). If the players run out of cards all points must be tallied. If either player has not received their respective biribakia, each player is penalized 100 points. The last player is the one to pick up the final card from the deck. Variations=Three- handed Biriba The game is the same as for four players, with the following differences: *The first biribaki consists of 18 cards, the second of 11. *The one who \\"closes\\" first, and takes the first biribaki, has the other two players as a team against him for the hand. The two other players share equally their points. Six-handed Biriba *The game is the same as for four players, three teams partners sitting opposite. Venezuelan version of Biriba Object: Be the first to earn 2500 points Base Points: 1000 points Wild Card (all Jokers and/or Wild 2's) in hand 750 points Wild Card (all Jokers and/or Wild 2's) accumulated 500 points Aces clean and in hand 400 points Aces dirty and in hand 400 points Aces clean accumulated 300 points Aces dirty accumulated 300 points Run/set clean in hand 200 points Run/set dirty in hand 200 points Run/set clean accumulated 100 points Run/set dirty accumulated 100 points Going out/ending the round 100 points Exact deal 50 points + or ‚Äì one card on the deal Card Value Points: Joker 50 points Wild 2's 25 points A's 20 points 8-K 10 points 3-7 5 points A Biriba is a group of at least 7 cards consisting of: Runs - must be of the same suit - A, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K, A. Sets ‚Äì same value card (all 3's; all 4's; all 5's... all J's; all Q's; all K's; all A's). Wild Card Biriba ‚Äì consists of Jokers and Wild 2's. If a wild card is added to a clean Biriba, the value of the Biriba drops to that of a dirty Biriba.  Non-partnership Game (2-3 Players) The Deal: 1\\\\. To determine the first dealer, the players take turns cutting the deck. The player to cut at the highest-ranking card (excluding Wild's and 2's) is the first dealer. 2\\\\. The dealer cuts from the bottom of the deck, attempting to cut from the bottom the exact number of cards that equals 11 cards per player, plus the one card which is placed face up next to the draw deck. The dealer hands this portion of the deck to the player to his left. 3\\\\. The dealer turns over the remaining top portion of the deck and looks only at the bottom three cards, being careful not to reveal the fourth card from the bottom. If any of the three cards is a Joker or Wild 2, the dealer gets the card(s). The dealer continues to check the cards at the bottom of the pile until the three cards at the bottom of the deck are not Jokers or Wild 2's. Any Jokers and/or Wild 2's found in this process become part of the dealer's first hand of a total of 11 cards. 4\\\\. The player to whom the dealer handed the cards then deals the first hand of cards for the round. If the dealer cut exactly, the dealer gets 100 points; if the dealer is + or ‚Äì one card, the dealer gets 50 points. If the dealer found any Jokers or Wild 2's at the bottom of the deck, these are counted as part of his/her first hand of a total of 11 cards. (Example: If three players and the dealer found two Jokers/Wild 2's in the bottom three cards, the deal of the first hand of 11 cards consists of 11 cards each for the two non-dealers and 9 cards for the dealer. If the cut from the bottom of the original deck was exactly 11+11+9+1, or 32 cards, then the dealer gets 100 base points; if either 31 or 33 cards, the dealer was off one card and gets 50 base points.). 5\\\\. The dealer then deals the Biriba piles (cards used for the second hand of cards for the round) consisting of 11 cards for each player. These cards are set aside for use after the first round of cards. The Play: The first hand of the round: 1\\\\. The third player (or the dealer, if only two players) makes the first play. a. The player may choose to pick up the entire pile of face up cards or choose one card from the face down remaining cards b. The player must discard one card 2\\\\. Going clockwise, each player takes a turn 3\\\\. The goal of the first hand is to be able to use every card in the player's hand a. Groups of at least 3 cards (the base for any Biriba, or group of 7 or more cards) b. Groups of cards may include no more than one wild/2 card c. If a group of wild cards are played, then the player may not use a wild card in any group of cards until the Wild Card Biriba is complete 4\\\\. If the player is able to lay down all cards except one, the one remaining card becomes the discard, and the player's turn is over. 5\\\\. If the player is able to lay down all cards on the table (with no discard), the player picks up his/her Biriba pile and continues the Biriba hand. 6\\\\. Once a card is no longer touching a player's physical fingers or hand, that card is considered played, and may not be retrieved. The Biriba hand: 1\\\\. The player picks up the Biriba pile 2\\\\. If the player did not have a discard when laying down the first round of cards, the player continues to play until he/she discards 3\\\\. The round ends when a player: a. Has used all cards and goes out with or without a discard b. Has at least one Biriba (completed group of 7 or more cards) 4\\\\. The points for each player are tallied, with the points in hand counted against the player(s) who did not end the round. The point tally includes the base points, and the card value points. The next round(s): 1\\\\. The player to the left of the dealer, then becomes the dealer and cuts the cards 2\\\\. The game continues until a player has 2500 points at the end of a round 3\\\\. If two or more players have at least 2500 points at the end of a round, the player with the highest total score is the winner. Partners Game (4 Players) Partners 1\\\\. The players chose partners; Team A and Team B 2\\\\. The partners sit opposite each other such that turns are taken by alternating team members The Deal: 1\\\\. To determine the first dealer, the players take turns cutting the deck. The player to cut with the highest card (excluding Wild's and 2's) is the first dealer. 2\\\\. The dealer cuts from the bottom of the deck, attempting to cut from the bottom the exact number of cards that equals 11 cards per player, plus one card which is placed face up next to the draw deck. 3\\\\. The dealer hands those cards to the player on his/her left. That player then deals the first hand of cards for the round. If the dealer cut exactly, the dealer gets 100 points for his/her team; if the dealer is + or ‚Äì one card, the dealer gets 50 points for his/her team. 4\\\\. The dealer then deals the Biriba piles (cards used for the second hand of cards for the round) consisting of 2 piles of 11 cards. These cards are set aside for use after the first round of cards. The Play: The first hand of the round: 1\\\\. The third player makes the first play. 2\\\\. Play continues the same as for a 2-3 player game, until one member of the team lays down his/her first hand The Biriba hand: 1\\\\. The player picks up the Biriba pile 2\\\\. If the player did not have a discard when laying down the first round of cards, the player continues to play until he/she discards 3\\\\. When it is the turn of the team member of the player who has laid down his/her first round of cards the player: a.

A true differentiator cannot be physically realized, because it has infinite gain at infinite frequency. A similar effect can be achieved, however, by limiting the gain above some frequency. The differentiator circuit is essentially a high-pass filter. An active differentiator includes some form of amplifier, while a passive differentiator is made only of resistors, capacitors and inductors. Passive differentiator The simple four-terminal passive circuits depicted in figure, consisting of a resistor and a capacitor, or alternatively a resistor and an inductor, behave as differentiators. Indeed, according to Ohm's law, the voltages at the two ends of the capacitive differentiator are related by a transfer function that has a zero in the origin and a pole in ‚àí1/RC and that is consequently a good approximation of an ideal differentiator at frequencies below the natural frequency of the pole: :Y=\\\\frac{Z_R}{Z_R+Z_C}X =\\\\frac{R}{R+1/sC}X =\\\\frac{sRC}{1+sRC}X \\\\implies Y\\\\approx sRCX \\\\quad \\\\text{for} \\\\ s\\\\ll 1/RC Similarly, the transfer function of the inductive differentiator has a zero in the origin and a pole in ‚àíR/L. Frequency response function of the passive differentiator circuits. \\\\omega_0 =1/RC for the capacitive circuit, while \\\\omega_0 =R/L for the inductive circuit Active differentiator=Ideal differentiator  Ideal differentiator A differentiator circuit (also known as a differentiating amplifier or inverting differentiator) consists of an operational amplifier in which a resistor R provides negative feedback and a capacitor is used at the input side. The circuit is based on the capacitor's current to voltage relationship :V = V(\\\\infty) + [(V(0+) - V(\\\\infty)] e^{-\\\\frac{t}{\\\\tau}}, :I = C \\\\frac{dV}{dt}, where I is the current through the capacitor, C is the capacitance of the capacitor, and V is the voltage across the capacitor. The current flowing through the capacitor is then proportional to the derivative of the voltage across the capacitor. This current can then be connected to a resistor, which has the current to voltage relationship :I = \\\\frac{V}{R}, where R is the resistance of the resistor. Note that the op-amp input has a very high input impedance (it also forms a virtual ground due to the presence of negative feedback), so the entire input current has to flow through R. If Vout is the voltage across the resistor and Vin is the voltage across the capacitor, we can rearrange these two equations to obtain the following equation: :V_\\\\text{out} = -RC \\\\frac{dV_\\\\text{in}}{dt}. From the above equation following conclusions can be made: * Output is proportional to the time derivative of the input. Hence, the op amp acts as a differentiator. * Above equation is true for any frequency signal. * The negative sign indicates that there is 180¬∞ phase shift in the output with respect to the input, Thus, it can be shown that in an ideal situation the voltage across the resistor will be proportional to the derivative of the voltage across the capacitor with a gain of RC. =Operation= Input signals are applied to the capacitor C. Capacitive reactance is the important factor in the analysis of the operation of a differentiator. Capacitive reactance is Xc = . Capacitive reactance is inversely proportional to the rate of change of input voltage applied to the capacitor. At low frequency, the reactance of a capacitor is high, and at high frequency reactance is low. Therefore, at low frequencies and for slow changes in input voltage, the gain, , is low, while at higher frequencies and for fast changes the gain is high, producing larger output voltages. If a constant DC voltage is applied as input, then the output voltage is zero. If the input voltage changes from zero to negative, the output voltage is positive. If the applied input voltage changes from zero to positive, the output voltage is negative. If a square-wave input is applied to a differentiator, then a spike waveform is obtained at the output. The active differentiator isolates the load of the succeeding stages, so it has the same response independent of the load. =Frequency response= The transfer function of an ideal differentiator is \\\\frac{V_\\\\text{out}}{V_\\\\text{in}} = -sRC, and the Bode plot of its magnitude is: 421x421px =Advantages= A small time constant is sufficient to cause differentiation of the input signal =Limitations= At high frequencies: * this simple differentiator circuit becomes unstable and starts to oscillate; * the circuit becomes sensitive to noise, that is, when amplified, noise dominates the input/message signal. Practical differentiator right In order to overcome the limitations of the ideal differentiator, an additional small-value capacitor C1 is connected in parallel with the feedback resistor R, which avoids the differentiator circuit to run into oscillations (that is, become unstable), and a resistor R1 is connected in series with the capacitor C, which limits the increase in gain to a ratio of . Since negative feedback is present through the resistor R, we can apply the virtual ground concept, that is, the voltage at the inverting terminal = voltage at the non-inverting terminal = 0. Applying nodal analysis, we get :\\\\frac{0 - V_o}{R} + \\\\frac{0 - V_o}{\\\\frac{1}{sC_1}} + \\\\frac{0 - V_i}{R_1 + \\\\frac{1}{sC}} = 0, :-V_o \\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{R} + sC_1\\\\right) = \\\\frac{V_i}{R_1 + \\\\frac{1}{sC}}. Therefore, :\\\\frac{V_o}{V_i} = \\\\frac{-sRC}{(1 + sR_1C)(1 + sRC_1)}. Hence, there occurs one zero at s = 0 and two poles at s = f_1 = \\\\tfrac{1}{2\\\\pi R_1C} and s = f_2 = \\\\tfrac{1}{2\\\\pi RC_1}. =Frequency response= 421x421px From the above plot, it can be seen that: * when f < f_1, the circuit acts as a differentiator; * when f_1 < f < f_2, the circuit acts as a voltage follower or buffer; * when f > f_2, the circuit acts as an integrator. If RC_1 = R_1C = RC (say), there occurs one zero at s = 0 and two poles at s = f_a = \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi RC}. For such a differentiator circuit, the frequency response would be 414x414px From the above plot, we observe that: * when f < f_a, the circuit acts as a differentiator; * when f > f_a, the circuit acts as an integrator. Applications The differentiator circuit is essentially a high-pass filter. It can generate a square wave from a triangle wave input and produce alternating-direction voltage spikes when a square wave is applied. In ideal cases, a differentiator reverses the effects of an integrator on a waveform, and conversely. Hence, they are most commonly used in wave-shaping circuits to detect high-frequency components in an input signal. Differentiators are an important part of electronic analogue computers and analogue PID controllers. They are also used in frequency modulators as rate-of-change detectors. A passive differentiator circuit is one of the basic electronic circuits, being widely used in circuit analysis based on the equivalent circuit method.

Lee Sowell. known as Bobby Sowell (born July 8, 1947, Memphis, Tennessee), is an American musician, pianist and composer. He spent much of his early years playing rockabilly piano in the late 1950s, playing organ in rock-and-roll bands in the 1960s and playing piano in numerous country music bands from the 1970s to the 1990s. He was a Mid-South Fair winner in 1966 and was inducted into the Rockabilly Hall of Fame in 2002. In 1994, he went out as a solo artist. As a pianist and composer, Sowell has recorded eight albums, crossing many genres of music, from jazz, pop, rock and roll, honky tonk and blues to country music, gospel and easy listening. The following Memphis musicians were all part of bands with Sowell from the 1960s to the 1990s: Barry Sowell (Amazing Rhythm Aces), Bobby Whitlock (Eric Clapton, George Harrison), Bill Humble (Elvis Presley, Tom Jones), Danny Fitzgerald (Johnny Rodriguez), David Miller (Bill Black, U2), Eddie Slusser (Jerry Lee Lewis, Hank Williams Jr.), Fred Prouty (Charlie Rich), Glenn Childress (Lonestar), Jack Holder (Black Oak Arkansas), Jim Gammell (Eddie Bond), Robert Johnson (The Rolling Stones, ZZ Top), Ronnie Scaife (Neil Diamond), and Roy Yeager (Crackerjacks, Lobo, Atlanta Rhythm Section, Ronnie Milsap). Biography Sowell was named after a famous Southern Baptist preacher, Dr. Robert G. Lee. When Sowell was drafted during the Vietnam War, he dropped the initial and became Robert Lee Sowell. In music, his stage name has always been Bobby or Bobby Lee. Growing up in Memphis, Sowell had diverse musical influences. Early influences included Hank Williams, Elvis Presley, Carl Perkins and Muddy Waters. But what really got his attention were the piano players of that day, Jerry Lee Lewis, Fats Domino, Ray Charles, Roger Williams and Floyd Cramer. When Sowell was 16, he met Cramer, and the experience had a lasting effect on his music. His father played harmonica and piano by ear, and his mother sang and played the guitar; she sang on the radio in Chattanooga, Tennessee, in the 1940s. They used to have regular family singalongs, inviting area musicians to join in. Early rock and roll along with rockabilly, honkytonk, blues, gospel and his mother's country music had an influence on Sowell's creativity and can be heard in his music style throughout his career. Early life About the time Sowell was 12 years old, honkytonk and rockabilly music were thriving in Memphis, and he started playing in bars and nightclubs with much older musicians. They used to sneak him in the back door and hide him behind an upright piano where no one could see how young he was. Sowell also played a lot of sock hops. He joined his first band, the Red Notes, an instrumental group, in 1959. His parents' house hosted many jam sessions for area musicians. Many successful professional musicians have come out of Frayser suburb of Memphis, and Sowell has picked with most of them. Around the age of 16 the British Invasion meant Sowell had to adapt to a new kind of music, in which the organ was a more prominent instrument than the piano. Sowell played in numerous groups in the 1960s. In 1966 he won the Mid-South Fair and was scheduled to appear on Ted Mack and the Original Amateur Hour on CBS Television, but before he could go there, he was drafted and served in the Vietnam War, and his music career was put on hold, although he played while in the military, NCO and Officers Clubs, winning talent shows. After the war and a bout with alcoholism, Sowell got back on the right track. He returned to his first love, the piano, playing and recording in an easy-listening style. Later life Bobby Sowell has been performing music professionally from 1959 to the present day. In 2010, he formed a new blues band, Coldwater Revival (CWR). He is actively performing solo gigs or with the band, recording new music.

(November 2005) Sutton Place, is a small street in the London Borough of Hackney. It links Homerton High Street with St John's Church Gardens, in Hackney. The Georgian terrace of 1790‚Äì1806, is Grade II listed as a whole, together with the villas on the north side of the street which date from 1820, and is sited in the conservation area around the gardens of St John-at-Hackney. The street replaced Church Path, an historic path connecting the villages of Homerton and Hackney. History=Description On the south side, is a stock-brick three-storeyed terrace of Georgian houses built by Charterhouse. The terrace was likely to have been designed by its inhouse surveyor, William Pilkington, between 1790 and 1806. It was then leased to William Collins in 1809. The terrace replaced a school in the large medieval Tan House (occupied by Thomas Sutton in Tudor times) which occupied the site at the east end of the terrace ‚Äì next to Sutton House. Sutton Place was constructed along the line of the short path across Church field, connecting Upper Homerton with the parish church of St John-at-Hackney.History of Homerton (at British History Online) The terrace is 'soot washed'. This was a technique whereby the entire frontage was given a coating of soot, before fine white lining was applied to the darkened mortar between the bricks. This gave the appearance of much finer brickwork.Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings, Technical Pamphlet 5 ‚Äì ‚ÄòPointing Stone and Brick Walling‚Äô G B A Williams 1986 The terrace appears uniform, but numbers 1 2 3 & 4 are the earlier and finer houses, with 'barrel' backs. Wrought iron railings and a light well separate the frontages from the street, with under pavement cellars for each house. It is a condition of the listing that external decoration must be black. This emphasises the austere look of the terrace. Georgian life As many as three servants would live and work in the basement of each house, hauling coal from the cellars to the grates in the upper house. The basements would have consisted of a small sitting (and sleeping) room, together with a kitchen at the back; with all the household cooking performed on a small range. Because this was such a small space, many of the washing and cooking activities took place in a range of small sheds at the rear of the buildings. At the rear of the houses are long gardens leading to a nightsoil path. This was for the removal of waste from the houses, which would be collected by cart. Main sewerage appears to have arrived with the culverting of Hackney Brook in about 1847, which is reputed to run in a large cast iron tube through the back gardens, before turning South down Isabella Road to join the main sewer network at Old Ford. Lead was stolen from the roof, of one of the houses under construction, on the night of 22 December 1808. The perpetrator was sentenced to be publicly whipped in Hackney Village and to one year in the House of Correction.A curious case of Lead, in the night (Old Bailey proceedings 1808) At each end of the terrace were two yards, for carriages and horses. The one adjacent to Sutton House was for many years a car breakers and repair garage (Taiko Autos) but has been acquired by the National Trust and turned into a garden for visitors called the Breaker's Yard, which includes features commemorating its former use. circa 1835, print of the Grammar School, with the new church in the background Hackney Grammar school The Hackney Proprietary Grammar school opened in 1830, on the north side of the street, adjacent to St John's churchyard, providing education for 130 boys. The Madras system was used, whereby elder boys were appointed monitors to take responsibility for the younger boys.This was named for another Hackney school in Mare Street, Madras House, under John Allen and using the system of the educational reformer Robert Ainsworth, founded in 1817. The school caused controversy for the number of non- conformist teachers and for a notorious ban on the sons of shopkeepers. By 1840, the school had declined to an entry of 50 pupils and was amalgamated with the Church of England Grammar school (on a site now occupied by a part of the Pembury Estate). The school building became a private building known as Sutton Lodge, and by the 1950s was demolished to extend the adjacent Metal Box factory.Hackney: Education, A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 10: Hackney (1995), pp. 148‚Äì165 accessed: 26 January 2008. Later use The north side of the street consists of villas built in 1820, also listed. There are two small blocks of flats at either end of the north side, filling in gaps in the terrace, but in keeping with the villas. The street survives intact, as it remained in the ownership of Charterhouse into the 20th century. Then it passed to the Metal Box Company, who developed a factory behind the buildings on the north side. The (unsightly) office block on the north-western corner was built to service the factory, on the site of the former Hackney Grammar School. The core of the Metal Box site became the award-winning Sutton Square, private development. Originally, the street was occupied by wealthy merchants and gentry, including at least one mayor of Hackney and the exiled German poet and revolutionary Ferdinand Freiligrath. However, in the early 20th century was leased to institutions, including one for the 'training of domestic servants' (a M.A.B.Y.S. home, Metropolitan Association for Befriending Young Servants, actually an attempt to save poor girls from a life of prostitution).1841‚Äì1901 UK CensusAuxiliary Home Listing accessed 3 May 2007 They fell into multiple occupation, and might have been demolished, but for their listing. From the 1970s individual private owners have endeavoured to restore the houses. A notable recent resident was Colin Firth, and Sutton Place has itself appeared in the film of Virginia Woolf's The Hours. Unusually, the street retains the original practice of sequentially numbering adjacent buildings (rather than grouping evens and odds). A Victorian postbox remains at the Homerton end of the street.

He was ordained a priest in December 1963. Ilonggo bible Having spent some years learning the Hiligaynon language on the island of Negros, Father O'Brien helped translate the first Vatican-approved Hiligaynon version of the bible.Daily Star Opinions: LETTERS Revolutionary activities In the 1970s, while posted in the mountain village of Tabugon, Kabankalan City, Negros Occidental, he formed a workers' co-operative, which he called a kibbutz. As Negros was largely a feudal society, with power concentrated in the hands of a few landowners with the support of the military, this action led to him being branded a communist by the authorities. Arrest for multiple murders On 6 May 1983, he was arrested along with two other priests, Fr. Brian Gore, an Australian, Fr. Vicente Dangan, a Filipino and six lay workers - the so-called \\"Negros Nine\\", for the murders of Mayor Pablo Sola of Kabankalan and four companions. The priests were held under house arrest for eight months but \\"escaped\\" to prison in Bacolod, the provincial capital, where they felt they would be safer. The case received widespread publicity in Ireland and Australia, the home of one of the co-accused priests, Fr. Brian Gore. Charlie Bird interviewed Fr. O'Brien in his overcrowded prison cell on RT√â TV. When Ronald Reagan visited Ireland in 1984, he was asked on Irish TV how he could help the missionary priest's situation. A phone call the next day from the Reagan administration to Ferdinand Marcos resulted in Marcos offering a pardon to Fr. O'Brien and his co-accused. Exile and return Rather than accept a pardon, which would imply guilt, the priests had the charges dropped against them in return for agreeing to leave the country. They were released on 3 July 1984. Fr. O'Brien made a promise to himself and his God, that if he should return home safely, that he would perform the ancient pilgrimage to Croagh Patrick, which he did at the end of July 1984.

Miller (born May 14, 1940) is an American writer for film and television. He is best known for his screenplay of the original Friday the 13th film, the popularity of which spawned a long series of sequels. Miller was not involved with any of the sequels, though he remains credited for creating the characters of Jason Voorhees, his mother Pamela, and the heroine Alice Hardy. He has also written for several daytime television series, for which he has won three Daytime Emmy Awards. His television work includes Guiding Light, One Life to Live, Another World, and All My Children. Much of his tenure of several shows has been working under head writer Megan McTavish. Early life Miller was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, the son of John Dabney and Barbara Leovy Miller. He attended Milton Academy in Milton, Massachusetts, and Yale in New Haven, Connecticut, where he says he took every creative writing course offered. Beginning in 1962, he worked in TV programming for a year with Stuart Erwin, Lee Rich, Irwin Segelstein, and Phil Capice at Benton & Bowles Advertising in New York City. He co-founded of the American Shakespeare Theatre's Center for Theatre Techniques in Education and attended Herbert Berghof's playwriting class in New York City. Directing and writing career Friday the 13th is Miller's most successful film, grossing $59,754,601 worldwide on a very low budget of $550,000. The original is the only one of the series that had Miller's involvement; it grew into a long series of sequels and became the highest grossing horror franchise in the United States, earning a worldwide total of $465,239,523. Miller says he hasn't seen any of the other Friday the 13th films because he does not approve of Jason Voorhees being the killer rather than Jason's mother as she was in the original. He also adapted two novels into films: he adapted A Stranger Is Watching by Mary Higgins Clark into the 1982 film of the same name and the 1967 young adult novel The Black Pearl by Scott O'Dell into the 1977 film of the same name. His horror film Rock Paper Dead is set to be released in 2018 and he has co-written the script for the horror thriller Eden Falls. Miller has also recently reacquired the rights to the first movie and has stated he may or may not approve future projects.https://1428elm.com/2019/02/27/friday- the-13th-victor-miller-plans-win/ Awards and nominations=Daytime Emmy AwardsNominations= *(1990, 1999, 2001, 2002 & 2004; Best Writing; All My Children) *(1994 & 1996; Best Writing; Another World) *(1983; Best Writing; One Life to Live) =Wins= *(1985, 1988 & 1998; Best Writing; All My Children) Writers Guild of America AwardNominations= *(1989 & 1999 Season; All My Children) *(1997 Season; Guiding Light) *(1993-1995 Season; Another World) =Wins= *WIN (1998, 2000, 2001 & 2003 Season; All My Children) Personal life Miller is the third of four children.

The mission of the Princeton Prize is ‚ÄúTo promote harmony, respect, and understanding among people of different races by identifying and recognizing high school age students whose efforts have had a significant, positive effect on race relations in their schools or communities.‚Äù By recognizing, rewarding, and reinforcing the good work of students who are making a difference, the Princeton Prize hopes to promote better race relations now and to provide an impetus for other young people to work towards racial understanding in the future. The Princeton Prize was initiated in the 2003/04 academic year, with pilot programs in the Boston and Washington, D.C. metropolitan areas. The program has grown dramatically since that time and is now nationwide. In the 2008/2009 academic year the Princeton Prize will be offered in 23 regions across the United States. It is hoped that the Princeton Prize will ultimately evolve into a nationally recognized awards program to which any high school age student in the country can apply. The Princeton Prize in Race Relations, together with a cash award of up to $1,000, is offered to those applicants doing the best work in each locale. In addition, other worthy applicants are honored with ‚ÄúCertificates of Accomplishment.‚Äù All honorees are recognized at their schools‚Äô awards assemblies and at area-wide recognition events.

Tasked as a Commando unit, 42 Cdo RM is capable of a wide range of operational tasks. Based at Bickleigh Barracks near Plymouth, personnel regularly deploy outside the United Kingdom on operations or training. 42 Commando is a specialised unit for maritime operations, meaning some of the posts within the unit, like heavy weapons specialists, could be reallocated across the Royal Navy. All personnel will have completed the Commando course at the Commando Training Centre (CTCRM) at Lympstone in Devon, entitling them to wear the green beret, with attached personnel having completed the All Arms Commando Course. History=Second World War Early Commando units were all from the British Army but by February 1942, the Royal Marines were asked to organise Commando units of their own, and 6,000 men volunteered.Haskew, pp.48‚Äì49 No. 42 (Royal Marine) Commando was raised in August 1943, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel R C de M. Leathes from the 1st Royal Marine Battalion, as part of the expansion of the commandos. They were assigned to the 3rd Special Service Brigade and served in India and Burma in 1943‚Äì45, including operations in the Arakan and Assam. It took part in the third Arakan campaign and carried out a series of amphibious landings down the Burmese coastline. Including the landings at Myebon and the Battle of Hill 170. It then returned to India to prepare for Operation Zipper the invasion of British Malaya. The war ended before the operation began and the commando was diverted to reoccupy Hong Kong.Moreman, p.93 Post-Second World War The British Reoccupation of Hong Kong in 1945: Men of 42 Marine Commando and children from the Tai Po Orphanage watch a fireworks display during a party hosted by the unit. Following the Second World War 1st, 2nd and 4th commando brigades disbanded leaving only one brigade ‚Äì the 3rd (40(RM), 42(RM) and 45(RM)). The Commando was involved in operations during the confrontation with Indonesia (Borneo). It was during this tour that the famous Limbang raid was conducted by Lima Company. Throughout the following decade it was based in Singapore at (RNAS Sembawang). Return to UK After the return to the UK, the Commando was deployed to Northern Ireland, the New Hebrides in 1980 and exercised regularly overseas. More recently the Commando has seen operational service in South Georgia, Montserrat in 1995, Iraq and Afghanistan. Falklands Conflict In 1982, following the Argentine invasion of the Falkland Islands, the Commando deployed on Operation Corporate. On 21 May the Commando were Brigade reserve at San Carlos under Lt. Col. Nick Vaux RM. The unit was deployed to seize Mount Kent in a night move by helicopter. By 4 June the unit had moved forward, mostly under cover of darkness, to positions west of high ground overlooking Port Stanley and the last Argentine stronghold. After days of probing reconnaissance, a Brigade assault took place on the night of 11/12 June in which the Commando's task was to secure Mount Harriet on the Brigade right flank. By moonlight and in freezing temperatures, 42 Commando moved undetected through enemy minefields in a right-flanking movement to surprise the enemy in their rear. Consecutive assaults by \\"K\\" and \\"L\\" Companies followed, up steep slopes onto company positions. Against strong resistance and continuous artillery bombardment, the Marines prevailed. By first light more than 30 enemy had been killed and over 300 prisoners taken as 42 Commando consolidated on Mount Harriet. 42 Commando suffered two fatalities themselves ‚Äì one on Mount Harriet and one on Wall Mountain.

He also edited the Pennsylvania Edition of The Worker, a weekend edition of the Communist- sponsored Daily Worker.  Early life  Lowenfels was born in New York City to a successful butter manufacturer on May 10, 1897. He graduated from a preparatory school in 1914, and served in the military during World War I, after which he began writing poetry. He worked for his father's company from 1914 until 1926. He met Lillian Apotheker, who later co-edited several of the anthologies of poetry he edited, in 1924, and the couple married in 1926. In 1925, with the financial assistance of Apotheker, he published his first collection of poems, Episodes & Epistles. In 1926 he left the family business to hone his poetic craft in Europe, spending time in Florence and Paris. There he was exposed to the literary scene, meeting Henry Miller, T. S. Eliot, Ford Madox Ford, and other luminaries. In 1930, while still in Paris, he co-founded Carrefour Press with Michael Fraenkel, which published the pamphlet Anonymous: The Need for Anonymity. The pamphlet was a manifesto declaring the need for anonymous publication in order to \\"avoid artistic competition and alienation.\\" In 1931 he shared the Richard Aldington Poetry Prize with e. e. cummings. Carrefour later anonymously published Lowenfels' play USA with Music, but was forced to reveal the identity of the playwright in 1932 when it filed a plagiarism suit against composer George Gershwin. Thereafter, the publishing house attributed its publications to their authors, effectively ending the anonymity movement. He continued to write and publish his poetry, which showcased his leftist political views, as well as editing the poetry of others. He also became concerned about the rise of fascism in Germany and Italy. Return to the United States Lowenfels returned to the United States in 1934, settling in the Mays Landing section of Hamilton Township, Atlantic County, New Jersey, and went back to work for his father. He continued to write poetry at night. He wrote to Henry Miller about the transition from poet to businessperson: \\"I butter from nine to five and then I change into a butterfly and go ahead with poems.\\" In 1938, he published Steel 1937, which began with an open letter to Philip Murray, the CIO organizer behind the unionization drive at Little Steel. The poems in the book commemorated the 18 steelworkers killed by US Steel during the 1937 Little Steel Strike, and also discussed the Spanish Civil War. Following the publication of Steel 1937, Lowenfels quit writing poetry and would not resume for 17 years. In 1938, Lowenfels moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where he became involved in the Civil Rights Movement and the struggles of working people. He began writing for and became the editor of the Pennsylvania edition of The Worker) weekend edition of the Daily Worker), a position he held until 1953. As a journalist and editor, his work focused on the lives of working people, especially African Americans. He was active in various causes, including the campaigns to free the Scottsboro Boys and Willie McGee, an African American veteran accused of rape in Laurel, Mississippi. (McGee was later executed.) He also supported striking coal miners, and campaigned to draft Franklin Roosevelt for a fourth presidential term. During the early years of this period, he only worked half time for the paper, supplementing his income by selling intercommunication devices door-to-door. He later worked full-time for The Daily Worker and the Pennsylvania Edition of The Worker, and his family's income depended heavily on his wife's public school teaching salary. On Christmas Day, 1949, Lowenfels published an article in the Worker entitled \\"Santa Claus or Comrade X?,\\" in which he mused about the \\"difficulties\\" of living with five women (his wife and four daughters) who spent their time washing, sewing and worrying about their clothes. The article was fiercely criticized by the paper's feminist readership, and the paper published several letters to the editor critical of the piece. Lowenfels' attempts to redeem himself in subsequent articles served only to anger his critics further, and the incident damaged his standing within the Party and the larger movement. The incident was examined as an example of efforts to confront male supremacy within progressive movements in a book by the historian Kate Weingard. In about 1951, Lowenfels suffered a heart attack, from which he recovered. He purchased a cabin in rural Weymouth Township, New Jersey, where he and his wife took up residence.Guide to the Walter Lowenfels Papers YCAL MSS 367, Yale University Library. Accessed October 28, 2015. \\"The same year, his family moved to a cabin in Weymouth, New Jersey.\\" Trial At 2 a.m. on July 29, 1953, the Federal Bureau of Investigation raided Lowenfels' cabin and arrested him. He was charged with conspiracy to overthrow the US government, a violation of the Smith Act. He was tried with five co-conspirators, a number that later grew to nine and also included Robert Klonsky. In a meeting of the accused to determine a defense strategy, it was agreed that Lowenfels' best contribution to would be to continue writing poetry. During the trial, he also took up the translation of poetry by French and Italian authors. During this period, Lowenfels completed Sonnets of Love and Liberty, a work dedicated \\"to Peace, the loveliest prisoner of our time.\\" During the trial, the government never used his own writings as evidence against him. \\"[T]hey chose, rather, passages from State and Revolution, as interpreted by FBI Marxists.\\" Lowenfels characterized the witnesses against him as \\"former communists who had become informers and agents for the FBI at a fair rate of pay\\". He and the co-conspirators were kept segregated from the general prison population in the maximum security division of Holmesburg County Prison in Philadelphia. Nonetheless, due to his health, was often allowed to visit friends who lived near the courthouse, and even made a cross-country trip with Lillian, during which he read poems publicly to raise money for his defense. He was convicted in 1954, but his conviction was overturned in higher courts shortly thereafter for lack of evidence. Later life Following his release, Lowenfels stopped editing the Pennsylvania Worker and returned to writing poetry. He never suffered any repercussions from his community; he later wrote, \\"In our area, people seemed to put \\"overthrow the government\\" in the same category as moonshine or illegal deer.\\" He became best known as an anthologist of avant-garde poetry. He edited an anthology of Walt Whitman's poetry, but his most famous anthology was the 1967 Where is Vietnam?, a compilation of the poetic responses to the Vietnam War. He was active in the anti-Vietnam War peace movement, serving as the associate editor of the anti-war publication Dialog, In 1968, Lowenfels joined hundreds of well-known figures in the Writers and Editors War Tax Protest. Along with the other protest participants, Lowenfels publicly declared his intention to refuse to pay a new surtax intended to fund the Vietnam War. In total, he wrote more than two dozen books of poetry. He also wrote an autobiography, My Many Lives, the second half of which is published in The Portable Walter, an anthology of his writings. Lowenfels died in Tarrytown, New York. His papers are housed in the special collections department of the Olin Library, the main library of the Washington University Library System, and the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library of Yale University.

Drug delivery refers to approaches, formulations, technologies, and systems for transporting a pharmaceutical compound in the body some time based on nanoparticles as needed to safely achieve its desired therapeutic effect. It may involve scientific site- targeting within the body, or it might involve facilitating systemic pharmacokinetics; in any case, it is typically concerned with both quantity and duration of drug presence. Drug delivery is often approached via a drug's chemical formulation, but it may also involve medical devices or drug-device combination products. Drug delivery is a concept heavily integrated with dosage form and route of administration, the latter sometimes even being considered part of the definition. Drug delivery technologies modify drug release profile, absorption, distribution and elimination for the benefit of improving product efficacy and safety, as well as patient convenience and compliance. Drug release is from: diffusion, degradation, swelling, and affinity-based mechanisms.Smart Materials for Drug Delivery Set, Editors: Carmen Alvarez-Lorenzo, Angel Concheiro, Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge 2013, https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/ebook/978-1-84973-552-0 Some of the common routes of administration include the enteral (gastrointestinal tract), parenteral (via injections), inhalation, transdermal, topical and oral routes. Many medications such as peptide and protein, antibody, vaccine and gene based drugs, in general may not be delivered using these routes because they might be susceptible to enzymatic degradation or can not be absorbed into the systemic circulation efficiently due to molecular size and charge issues to be therapeutically effective. For this reason many protein and peptide drugs have to be delivered by injection or a nanoneedle array. For example, many immunizations are based on the delivery of protein drugs and are often done by injection. Protein drugs delivered by injection can usually reach the extracellular space. Many approaches have been evaluated for targeting the intracellular space with protein drugs but delivering proteins into cells (e.g. into the cytosol) is still challenging. Current efforts in the area of drug delivery include the development of targeted delivery in which the drug is only active in the target area of the body (for example, in cancerous tissues), sustained release formulations in which the drug is released over a period of time in a controlled manner from a formulation, and methods to increase survival of peroral agents which must pass through the stomach's acidic environment. In order to achieve efficient targeted delivery, the designed system must avoid the host's defense mechanisms and circulate to its intended site of action. Types of sustained release formulations include liposomes, drug loaded biodegradable microspheres and drug polymer conjugates. Survival of agents as they pass through the stomach typically is an issue for agents which cannot be encased in a solid tablet; one research area has been around the utilization of lipid isolates from the acid-resistant archaea Sulfolobus islandicus, which confers on the order of 10% survival of liposome- encapsulated agents.

The Grebbe Line ran from the Grebbeberg in Rhenen northwards until the IJsselmeer. Early history and first decommissioning The Grebbe Line was first established in 1745 as a line of defense to protect the Netherlands from invading armies. If an invasion was imminent, parts of the area between Spakenburg and the Grebbeberg were to be flooded. Until World War II it was never actually used for this purpose; an attempt was made in 1794 to establish a defensive line against the invading French army under General Jean-Charles Pichegru, but the joint English-Dutch army abandoned the line when the French troops approached. Throughout the 19th century the Grebbe line was maintained as a defensive line. However, since no attacks appeared likely it was deemed less necessary to maintain the costly fortifications, and in 1926 a large part of the fortifications was decommissioned. World War II In 1939 the disused line was once again fortified against a German attack on the Netherlands, but due to cost issues reinforcements never reached an acceptable level. In the extensive 1939-defence plans, in which the Grebbeline would be provided with more extensive and much denser concrete reinforcements, the line would fulfill its ancient task as a forward line of defensive. These plans would however never be executed, surpassed as they were by the events of the German invasion in May 1940. The Grebbeline by that time had been largely constructed behind vast inundations, after which a front line lay that was composed of classic trench works mixed with ferro and ferro-concrete bunkers of light and medium grade. The front-line trenches had hardly any depth and contained only half a battalion of infantry per single km of stretched line. Behind this front-line was a second row of trenches which had the function of a blocking defence should the front-line be penetrated. Reserves could be thrown in from this line and behind it were battalion and regimental CP's as well as forward light artillery positions. More to the rear were the medium and heavy artillery positions as well as divisional reserves. The Grebbeline had two weak spots. The first two were near the city of Amersfoort, the third one near the village Rhenen, where the elevated Grebbeberg - a 150 feet high elevation - had made inundation works impossible. These sectors had been additionally fortified. Instead of inundations it had been decided to place forward positions ahead of the main defences. In the meantime a large and bomb-proof pump house had come under construction that, once it would be operable, would be able to flood the area in front of the Grebbeberg after all. Also this counter-measure came too late in time. This left the Grebbeberg as a very vulnerable position in the entire Grebbeline. That had not gone unnoticed by the attackers to be. The Germans had extensively studied the battle grounds that they were to use in May 1940. Way ahead of the actual invasion German army staff officers managed to visit the Grebbeline in civilian outfits, carefully studying the actual threats and opportunities. Particularly the Rhenen area, close to the Rhine river, was noticed. It was the shortest away from German soil and seemed to be a weak spot in the Dutch defence line. The 207th Infantry Division chose to place its most formidable push at this point, for which it had the motorized SS Regiment Der F√ºhrer at its disposal too. The adjacent 227th Infantry Division, accompanied by the motorized SS Leibstandarte 'Adolf Hitler', had a less profound picture of the plans ahead. It chose to decide where to attack during the operation instead of before. Come May 1940, the two German divisions c/w their respective SS Regiments and additional heavy artillery regiments had little trouble overcoming the first obstacles and managed to reach the Grebbeline on the second day, although the 227th division would need more time, meeting more Dutch resistance on the way. The 207th division was supported by five artillery battalions and spearheaded by the fanatic SS Der F√ºhrer regiment. The latter had first raided the Arnhem fortifications near Westervoort and subsequently massed in the city of Wageningen opposing the Grebbeline. On the second day the SS regiment managed to take the forward defences, albeit that it took them all day and losses mounted considerably. The third day they managed to penetrate the front line near the Grebbeberg itself, fighting the rest of the day and evening to widen the gap. The SS was blocked by the last Dutch defence line though, causing the commander of the 207th division to move in his own division and move SS Der Fuhrer away to the north of the Grebbeberg. The SS Regiment had by then suffered severe losses, its third battalion was out of action entirely. Overnight the Dutch planned a major counterattack by four infantry battalions, which operation was poorly executed and moreover collided with an SS assault along the northern perimeter of the Grebbeberg defences mid-day on the fourth day of the invasion. German dive bombers sealed the fate of both the Dutch counterattack and the local defences period. The 207th division assaults over the Grebbeberg itself had been successful too, although severe losses were absorbed. By the end of the day the German infantry stood in the village of Rhenen. Around night fall the Germans realized that the Dutch defences had moved back. A quick reaction force from SS motorized units was formed, but would not manage to overtake the Dutch forces, that had also left one or two blocking parties behind to slow potential enemies down. The battle of the Grebbeberg had demanded 420 Dutch and around 250 German KIA. The number of WIA was about quadruple those numbers. The Dutch had lost thousands of POWs too as well as a great deal of material and artillery pieces. The second major battle during the German invasion was seen near the city of Scherpenzeel. The 227th Infantry Division had been slowed down by continuing Dutch cavalry efforts to counter their approach. Moreover, the SS Leibstandarte had been called off on the third day and been instructed to redeploy to the south of the Netherlands, where it had to push along the 9th Panzer Division. The 227th were on their own from then on and had decided to attack the Grebbeline near Scherpenzeel. That had been a poor selection of battlefield by the German division commander. The defences made a funny curve at this point, creating a right-angled shape with a steep corner in it. It was exactly at this point that two German infantry regiments had decided to assault the defences. By doing so they positioned themselves such that they got exposed to defensive fire from fixed and trench defences as well as artillery along two-thirds of their front and flank side. A basic offensive failure, hence a costly German defeat followed. Overnight the most forward pinned down German attackers managed to crawl back into their own lines. The 227th had lost 70 KIA during this effort, of which most of the 412th Regiment. Overnight Dutch artillery unleashed a heavy barrage on the suspected German positions, gradually bringing down the density of fire, which finally ceased shortly before dawn. The German command was quite under awe by this show of presence and had anticipated heavy fighting in the morning, but much to their surprise found the Dutch trenches deserted by morning. Behind the masquerade of the barrages the entire defence had moved back overnight. Pursued came much too late to overtake any Dutch formation before it had reached the next defences. Directly after the cessation of hostilities a large war cemetery was established on top of the Grebbeberg. German and Dutch victims of the battle were the first to be buried at this location, but during the war the Germans would use and extend this burial ground further as their death toll rose. After the war the Dutch reburied the German victims on the summary German field of honour in Ysselsteyn, where over 30,000 Germans were buried. The Grebbeberg war cemetery now holds around 800 Dutch victims of the May War in 1940, as well as a few of later (wartime) date. The Grebbe line was permanently decommissioned by the Dutch Government in 1951. Pantherstellung During the war the Germans made use of the Grebbe line to create their own defence line called the Pantherstellung.http://www.grebbelinie.nl/page/pantherstellung Panthestellung On 26 October 1944 General Walter Model initiated the building of the Pantherstellung. At that time it was clear that the enemy would not enter from the west but from the south. The Germans wanted to protect the Holland region because of the V-2 rocket attacks on London. The Germans didn't want to lose the ability to fire the rockets and wanted to prevent the Allies from reaching the IJsselmeer. The Germans had to make some changes to the design, because the threat was expected from the south. From Veenendaal to Amersfoort the defence line had the same configuration as the Grebbe line.

History The name Coker comes from Coker Water (\\"crooked stream\\" from the Celtic Kukro). Artifacts from early settlement in the parish include a polished stone axe and boat shaped-bronze brooch. A Roman villa has been excavated and a bronze plate inscribed to the god Mars discovered. From this Mars was given the title Mars Rigisamus (which means \\"greatest king\\" or \\"king of kings\\") as it depicts a standing naked male figure with a close-fitting helmet; his right hand may have once held a weapon, and he probably originally also had a shield (both are now lost). The same epithet for a god is recorded from Bourges in Gaul. The use of this epithet implies that Mars had an extremely high status, over and above his warrior function. The manor descended with its neighbour East Coker until the 14th century when it passed to a junior branch of the Courtenay family. It was later held by the Dukes of Somerset and Northumberland protectors of Edward VI and later still by the Portmans of Orchard Portman. The original manor house burned down during an attack in the Wars of the Roses, although the current hamstone manor house has medieval origins, the earliest surviving portions probably being of around 1500. It is a grade I listed building. The village had a long history of growing hemp and flax for sailcloth manufacture, which made \\"Coker Canvas\\" highly prized by naval captains during the Napoleonic Wars. Dawes Twine Works, a late 19th- century historic building in the village used for the manufacture of rope and twine, was a featured candidate on the BBC Restoration TV series in 2006. The ropewalk is on the Heritage at Risk Register. Governance The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council‚Äôs operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council. The Parish Council also looks after the recreation ground which has a pavilion, a tennis court, cricket pitches, children's sports areas and the Scouts and Guides buildings. The village falls within the Non-metropolitan district of South Somerset, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Yeovil Rural District. The district council is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. Somerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning. The village is in 'Coker' electoral ward. The wards stretches from Odcombe in the north west to Barwick in the north east and Hardington Mandeville in the south west. The population of the ward at the 2011 census was 5,310. It is also part of the Yeovil county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election, and part of the South West England constituency of the European Parliament which elects seven MEPs using the d'Hondt method of party-list proportional representation. Geography Nearby is the Hardington Moor Site of Special Scientific Interest and national nature reserve where meadows are examples of species-rich unimproved neutral grassland, which is now nationally rare. The rare French oat-grass is very abundant on the site and the fields are home to a wide variety of plant species, most notably adder's tongue, corky-fruited water-dropwort and large numbers of green-winged orchid. Invertebrates found at the site include butterflies such as gatekeeper, small tortoiseshell and common blue. Less commonly seen are large skipper, green-veined white and green hairstreak.Hardington Moor NNR Transport The parish has no railway station, the nearest being Yeovil Junction on the West of England line. There are a few bus routes: the main ones are: Route 47 (First Hampshire & Dorset) Bridport-Yeovil which operates four journeys a day Monday to Friday and three journeys on Saturday and Sunday, and Route 96 which run approximately every 90 minutes on weekdays (SouthWest Coaches) Chard/Crewkerne-Yeovil. Also Route N8 (Nippy Bus) West Coker(Lakefields)-Yeovil operates hourly Monday to Saturday Daytime and two journeys morning peak hours to Yeovil and one peak hour return and Route N14 (Nippy Bus) East Chinnock-Yeovil provides one return journey Monday-Friday daytime to give access to doctors surgeries in Yeovil. The parish also has some innovative demand responsive transport provided by Nippy Bus, the N8 can be booked to pick up passengers off route in the parish after first registering and calling the company an hour before travel and will arrange a convenient time within the hours of operation to pick people up. Village features and services West Coker is served by two pubs;‚Äî The Castle Inn and the Royal George. The castle Inn was completely gutted in 2013 by fire, although operated for a number of years after before being closing permanently in 2016. It is re-opening in April 2020 once again as a pub and restaurant after having a new refit. Near the village centre there is a garage (which carries out MoT tests, sells fuel and incorporates a local shop), a butcher's shop, a post office, Lanes Hotel/restaurant and a bistro. About one mile to the east are the Yeovil Court hotel and a petrol station and convenience store. There are other small businesses on the site of a former twine works in East Street. West Coker Primary school has about 80 pupils. The West Coker Commemoration Fund is a charity which administers the affairs of the village hall.  Literary Reference  West Coker is Thomas Hardy's Narrowbourne, and features in the story A Tragedy of Two Ambitions in his collection Life's Little Ironies published in 1894. Religious sites The Church of Saint Martin of Tours has 13th- or 14th-century origins but was mostly rebuilt in 1863-64.

These sluggish, bottom-dwelling sharks are found widely in the tropical and temperate coastal waters of the Indian and Pacific Oceans. They have stocky, spindle-shaped bodies and short, broad, and flattened heads. The mouth is capacious, containing many small teeth and lacking furrows at the corners. The two dorsal fins are placed far back on the body, with the first much larger than the second. Different species have various color patterns of saddles, blotches, reticulations, and/or spots. The largest members of the genus can grow over in length. Swellsharks prey on a variety of fishes and invertebrates, and are oviparous, with females producing egg capsules in pairs. They are harmless and have been deemed of having no commercial value. Taxonomy The genus Cephaloscyllium was proposed by American ichthyologist Theodore Gill from the Greek kephale (\\"head\\") and skylion (\\"dogfish\\"), in an 1862 issue of Annals of the Lyceum of Natural History of New York. However, most of Gill's contemporaries, particularly those in Europe, preferred to keep the swellsharks within the genus Scyllium (a synonym of Scyliorhinus). Cephaloscyllium did not gain wide acceptance until Samuel Garman published \\"The Plagiostomia\\" in a 1913 volume of Memoirs of the Museum of Comparative Zoology, in which he recognized three species: C. isabellum, C. ventriosum, and C. umbratile. A long history of taxonomic confusion exists regarding the species within Cephaloscyllium owing to several factors, including variation in appearance (particularly between juveniles and adults), the existence of multiple undescribed species, a paucity of detailed scientific descriptions and type material, and the use of unreliable characters. Until recently, various authors had recognized five to eight species, along with at least five undescribed species in Australian waters and more in the western central Pacific and the Indian Ocean. In 2008, significant strides were made in resolving the taxonomy of Cephaloscyllium, with a revision of the genus and an increase in the number of described species to 21. Species There are currently 17 recognized species in this genus: * Cephaloscyllium albipinnum Last, Motomura & W. T. White, 2008 (Whitefin swellshark) * Cephaloscyllium cooki Last, S√©ret & W. T.

Not yet described (New Caledonia swellshark) * Cephaloscyllium sp. Not yet described (Red Sea swellshark) Phylogeny and evolution Morphological and molecular phylogenetic studies have shown the closest relative of Cephaloscyllium to be Scyliorhinus, and these two genera and Poroderma form the subfamily Scyliorhininae, the most basal clade of the order Carcharhiniformes. The oldest confirmed Cephaloscyllium fossils come from Miocene epoch (23-5.3 Mya) deposits in California, though based on the rate of DNA divergence in sharks, the swellshark lineage likely dates back to the Cretaceous period (145.5-65.5 Mya). Distribution and habitat Cephaloscyllium is widely distributed in the Indian and Pacific Oceans, in temperate and tropical waters, but not close to the equator. Swellshark diversity is greatest around Australia and in the west-central Pacific, where multiple endemic species are found. The most far- flung members of the genus are C. sufflans off southeastern Africa, C. silasi off southwestern India, C. umbratile in the northwestern Pacific, and C. ventriosum along the western coast of the Americas. One hypothesis states Cephaloscyllium originally evolved in Australia and New Guinea, and subsequently dispersed outwards in a series of colonization events, eventually reaching Africa and the Americas. Cephaloscyllium species, bottom-dwelling sharks, can be found from the intertidal zone to a depth of on upper continental and insular slopes. Description Swellsharks (C. ventriosum) have broad, flattened heads and thick bodies. Swellsharks are stocky and spindle-shaped, with the trunk tapering substantially to the caudal peduncle. The head is short (comprising less than a fifth of the total length), broad, and flattened. The snout is very short and blunt, with the nostrils preceded by laterally enlarged flaps of skin. The eyes are horizontally oval or slit- like and placed high on the head, with cat-like pupils and rudimentary nictitating eyelids. A broad ridge occurs beneath each eye, and a spiracle behind. The mouth is very large and wide, containing numerous small, multicusped teeth; the upper teeth are exposed when the mouth is closed (except in C. silasi). No furrows are found at the corners of the mouth. The pectoral fins are generally large and broad, and the pelvic fins are small. The two dorsal fins are placed far back on the body: the first dorsal fin originates behind the pelvic fin origins, while the second dorsal fin is positioned about opposite the anal fin. The first dorsal and anal fins are much larger than the second dorsal fin. The tail is short; the caudal fin is broad with a distinct lower lobe and a strong ventral notch near the tip of the upper lobe. The skin is thick and covered by well-calcified dermal denticles. The coloration is typically grayish or brownish, with a variety of patterns that include saddles, blotches, reticulations, and/or spots. In several species, the juveniles differ substantially in coloration from the adults. Cephaloscyllium species generally fall into two size groups: dwarf species include C. fasciatum and C. silasi, which are under long, and large species include C. umbratile and C. ventriosum, which may exceed in length. Biology and ecology Members of the genus Cephaloscyllium are generally slow-moving, sedentary animals with an anguilliform (eel-like) mode of swimming. Of the species whose diets have been documented, they have been known to feed on a wide variety of benthic organisms, including other sharks and rays, bony fishes, crustaceans, and molluscs. Swellsharks are perhaps best known for their ability to inflate themselves by rapidly swallowing water or air when threatened; this behavior may allow them to wedge themselves inside crevices, make themselves harder to swallow, and/or intimidate a would-be predator. Reproduction is oviparous, with females producing two eggs at a time, one in each oviduct. Individual eggs are enclosed in a flask-shaped capsules with tendrils at the corners that allow them to be attached to underwater structures. Human interactions Swellsharks are harmless to humans and generally of no economic value, but are susceptible to being caught as bycatch in artisanal and commercial fisheries. Several species (e.g. C. umbratile and C. ventriosum), are known to be extremely hardy, capable of surviving out of water for extended periods and adapting readily to captivity.

Artwork, style, and influences Left Behind 2 Again by Mickalene Thomas, 2012, Honolulu Museum of Art During her early career, she found herself immersed in the growing culture of DIY artists and musicians, leading her to start her own body of work.

Inhabiting the '70s-style genre of Blaxploitation, the subjects in Thomas's paintings and collages radiate sexuality, which has been interpreted by some as satire of misogynistic and racist tropes in media, including films and music associated with the Blaxploitation genre.

NBC Washington. August 22, 2010 In her 2017 solo exhibition \\"Mentors, Muses, and Celebrities\\" at the Contemporary Art Museum St. Louis (CAM), Thomas created multi-media installations that centered black women in the narrative-arcs of their own stories. According to art critic Rikki Byrd: \\"Positioning black women ‚Äî artists, actresses, characters, and her own family ‚Äî as mentors and muses, and as heroic figures in a lineage of their own, Thomas overrides oppressive narratives.\\" The many years that Thomas has spent studying art history, portrait painting, landscape painting, and still life has informed her work. She has drawn inspiration from multiple artistic periods and cultural influences throughout Western art history, particularly the early modernists such as Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, √âdouard Manet, and Romare Bearden. She models her figures on the classical poses and abstract settings popularized by these modern artists as a way to reclaim agency for women who have been represented as objects to be desired or subjugated. Thomas is known for her elaborate mixed-media paintings composed of rhinestones, acrylic, and enamel that present a \\"complex vision of what it means to be a woman and expands common definitions of beauty.\\" Rhinestones serve as an added layer of meaning and a metaphor for artifice. Rhinestones accentuate specific elements of each painting, while subtly confronting our assumptions of what is feminine and what defines a woman, specifically black women. According to the Financial Times, \\"Proclaiming her own visibility and that of other women of colour is at the heart of Thomas‚Äôs practice, which inserts the black female body into art history by placing her muses in iconic poses and settings.\\" Thomas, and curators of her work, see Thomas's status as a black lesbian as part of what makes her gaze different from that of white male artists in history. Thomas's subjects are virtually always women of color; a means to portray and empower the women and celebrate their culture and beauty‚Äîsometimes by incorporating them into iconic Western paintings. As a member of, and inspired by, the Post- Black Art movement, Thomas' work redefines perceptions of race, gender, and sexuality. Thomas blurs the distinction between object and subject, concrete and abstract, real and imaginary. Her subjects often look directly at the viewer, challenging the dominance of the male gaze in art. This assertive portrayal indicates that the models are at ease in their own skin, thus challenging the stereotype of the silent and inferior woman objectified by the viewer's gaze. In addition, seemingly insignificant decisions (like not straightening the figures‚Äô hair) have the important effect of encouraging women of color to accept themselves as they are and not conform to a particular ideology of beauty imposed by society. Thomas's work is also distinctive in its foregrounding of queer identity; she is a queer woman of color representing women of color in a way that emphasizes their agency and erotic beauty. By emphasizing the women's striking presence and sensuality along with their assertive gazes, Thomas empowers these subjects, representing them as resilient, stunning women who command the spectator's attention. The sitters have the control and power of the gaze, and when this exchange is between women, it subverts the traditional dominance of the male gaze in art and visual culture. Thomas's queer identity is foregrounded, for example, in her painting and print edition entitled Sleep: Deux femmes noires (2012 and 2013), in which we see two female bodies intertwined in an embrace, on a sofa, thus highlighting for her audience the femininity, beauty, and sexuality of women lovers.  Le D√©jeuner Sur l'Herbe: Les Trois Femmes Noires  Le d√©jeuner sur l'herbe: Les Trois Femmes Noires is a painting created by African-American visual artist Mickalene Thomas. The title of the painting translates from French as The luncheon on the grass: The Three Black Women. The painting is a contemporary take on √âdouard Manet's 1863 painting entitled Le dejeuner sur l'herbe. Thomas' piece portrays three black women adorned with rich colors, vintage patterned clothing, and radiant Afro-styled hair. The women's positioning and posing is reminiscent of the subjects of Manet's piece, but the powerful gazes of all three women are fixed on the viewer. Thomas created the painting, her largest piece at the time, in 2010 after being commissioned by the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York City to create a display piece for 53rd street window of the museum's restaurant The Modern. = Description = Le d√©jeuner sur l'herbe: Les Trois Femmes Noires was created in three stages. First, Thomas photographed three models in the sculpture garden of the MoMA to make the piece ‚Äúsite-specific‚Äù. Thomas then created a collage using the photograph as a base material and added other elements. This collage now hangs in the lobby of the P.S.1, an extension of the MoMA in Queens that houses unconventional contemporary artwork. The third, painted version was based on the original photograph but composed of collage- like painted segments on wood panels and rendered in acrylic, oil, enamel, and rhinestones. The painting stands 10 feet tall and extends 24 feet wide. Thomas has stated that she chose the massive size of the painting to physically and symbolically ‚Äútake up space‚Äù in spaces that were traditionally dominated by white male artists. The original installation of the painting was in the window of The Modern, MoMA's renowned restaurant. While on display here, the piece was visible every hour of the day because it could be seen by passersby on the street; this accessibility made Le d√©jeuner sur l'herbe: Les Trois Femmes Noires Thomas' most public piece yet. The subjects of the painting are three rhinestone-studded, richly dressed women of color. The models who are the subjects of the original Le d√©jeuner sur l'herbe: Les Trois Femmes Noires photograph are all friends of Thomas which is common across many of her photographs. All three women are fully clothed‚Äì compared to the nude female subjects in Manet's version of the scene‚Äì in richly patterned dresses that Thomas herself designed, and they sit upon fabrics staged by the artists. Many vintage patterns are used throughout the work. Thomas claims that this juxtaposition of patterns serves to represent the \\"amalgamation of all of the different things we are as Americans.\\" Behind the women in both the photograph and the painting sits a Matisse sculpture that was situated behind the women in the sculpture garden. = Influences = Le d√©jeuner sur l'herbe: Les Trois Femmes Noires is unmistakably based on √âdouard Manet's 1863 painting Le D√©jeuner sur l'herbe. Manet's piece, which caused intense controversy at the time of its creation, exhibits two undressed women who are sitting comfortably with two formally dressed men at a picnic. While one of the nude women is crouched in the background, the three other subjects lounge in the foreground. The female subject in the foreground is looking out, meeting the gaze of the viewer, while the two men next to her are casually looking around. In Thomas' version of the painting, the three subjects in the foreground are all women of color who are fully clothed in colorful dresses with patterns reminiscent of the 1970s, and all three of the women's gazes confront the viewer. The woman in the background of Manet's scene is represented in Thomas' piece by a Matisse sculpture in front of which she positioned the models in the photograph taken in the MoMA sculpture garden. Paying homage to Matisse by using his sculpture as a figure in her piece is not anomalous for Thomas as she often includes allusions to the iconic artist in her works. Thomas has cited Romare Bearden as an influence. In addition to these explicit allusions, Le d√©jeuner sur l'herbe: Les Trois Femmes Noires, along with many of Thomas' other pieces, is inspired by Dada, cubism, and the Harlem Renaissance. =Response= The majority of critical responses to Le d√©jeuner sur l'herbe: Les Trois Femmes Noires address the piece's interaction with post- black and post-feminist ideas. Thomas‚Äô work has received criticism common of post-black art claiming that, through the overtly sensual representation of her subjects, she is reveling ‚Äúin the glittery spoils of success at the expense of meaningful social engagement.‚Äù Proponents of her work, however, believe that her approach to representing her subjects ‚Äúreflects the shift in black art from didactic political narrative to post-black satire.‚Äù Regarding the way in which the subjects meet the viewer‚Äôs gaze, Seattle Art Museum curator Catharina Manchanda remarked, \\"these women are so grounded and perfectly comfortable in their own space... While we might be looking at them, they are also sizing us up.\\" MoMA curator Klaus Biesenbach who originally commissioned the painting for the 53rd street window display explained that he requested Thomas largely because \\"her treatment of surfaces as complex layers of material, lacquer, rhinestone and paint corresponds with the libidinous nature of the contents she depicts.\\" Since the original installment of this painting wherein the piece was exhibited as a singular display, Le d√©jeuner sur l'herbe: Les Trois Femmes Noires has been included in a number of exhibits across North America including the Art Gallery of Ontario, the Seattle Art Museum, and the Baltimore Museum of Art. Film, music, and video art In addition to her paintings, the Brooklyn-based Thomas works in the mediums of photography, collage, printmaking, video art, sculpture and installation art. Her works, in particular the Odalisque series (2007), have been interpreted as \\"investigating the artist-model relationship [...] but from an updated perspective of female inter-subjectivity and same-sex desire.\\" (La Le√ßon d'amour, 2008) She has restaged themes and symbolism with a long lineage in Western art in her references to the odalisque representation of women in exotic settings. She experimented with institutional images in FBI/Serial Portraits (2008), based on mug shots of African-American women. In 2012, Mickalene Thomas: Origin of the Universe, her first major solo museum exhibition, opened at the Santa Monica Museum of Art and traveled to the Brooklyn Museum. This show, the title of which references Gustave Courbet‚Äôs 1866 painting L‚ÄôOrigine du monde, showcased a series of recent portraits, landscapes and interiors. Thomas has collaborated with musician Solange, creating the cover art for her 2013 EP True. The cover began as a portrait of Solange the artist herself commissioned. Thomas and Solange also collaborated on a trailer for the music video for the song \\"Losing You.\\" Her short film Happy Birthday to a Beautiful Woman, created for her exhibition at the Brooklyn Museum, is about Sandra Bush, her mother and longtime muse. In it, Sandra talks about careers, relationships, beauty, and her fatal illness. The film made its television debut on HBO on February 24, 2014, and has run regularly since. Recognitions and honors Thomas has been awarded multiple prizes and grants, including the BOMB Magazine Honor (2015), MoCADA Artistic Advocacy Award (2015), AICA-USA Best Show in a Commercial Space Nationally, First Place (2014), Anonymous Was A Woman Grant (2013), Audience Award: Favorite Short, Second Annual Black Star Film Festival (2013), Brooklyn Museum Asher B. Durand Award (2012), Timehri Award for Leadership in the Arts (2010), Joan Mitchell Foundation Grant (2009), Pratt Institute Alumni Achievement Award (2009) and Rema Hort Mann Foundation Emerging Artist Grant (2007). Thomas has held residencies at Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture, Madison, Maine (2013) (resident faculty); Versailles Foundation Munn Artists Program, Giverny, France (2011); Anderson Ranch Arts Center, Aspen, Colorado (2010); Studio Museum in Harlem (2003); Vermont Studio Center, Johnson, Vermont (2001); and Yale Norfolk Summer of Music and Art, Norfolk, Connecticut (1999).

History Like Puerto Rico, the islands belonged to Spain until 1898. On September 19, 1898, the United States took possession of the islands after the signing of the armistice that ended military operations in the Spanish-American war. The islands, along with the islands of Puerto Rico, Mona, Monito, Desecheo, and other smaller islands adjacent to the island of Puerto Rico, were formally ceded by Spain to the United States with the signing of the Treaty of Paris on December 10, 1898. Geography South coast of Pineiro Island Puerto Rican tourist literature uses the name Spanish Virgin Islands, but most general maps and atlases do not treat these islands as part of the Virgin Islands archipelago. They are mostly referred to as \\"Islas Municipio\\" with Vieques being called \\"Isla Nena\\". As part of Puerto Rico, the Passage Islands are part of a territory of the United States, and they belonged to Spain before the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War in 1898. Spanish remains the predominant language, although English is also common. The principal islands of the group are Culebra and Vieques, with multiple associated smaller islands and islets. Other islands that are close to the shore of Puerto Rico include: Icacos Island, Cayo Lobo, Cayo Diablo, Palomino Island, Palominito Island, Isla de Ramos, Isla Pineiro, Cayo Lobo. Near Culebra there is Cayo Luis Pe√±a. Culebra's smaller island, Cayo Norte, is part of Culebra National Wildlife Refuge. Much of Vieques is part of Vieques National Wildlife Refuge, formerly a U.S. Navy facility.

The episode was written by Ed Burns from a story by David Simon & Ed Burns and was directed by Dan Attias. It originally aired on October 17, 2004. Plot Bubbles and Johnny argue about the morality of acting as paid police informants. Johnny persuades Bubbles to run a short con with him instead of reporting to Greggs. Once Johnny has the money, Bubbles is nowhere to be found. Meanwhile, Carcetti reads a story in the paper about a murdered state's witness and is concerned about the message the killing sends. He takes the issue to Mayor Royce, who promises to act quickly. At a committee hearing, Gray confronts Burrell and Rawls about the witness, while Carcetti urges him to lay off. At the ComStat meeting, Rawls questions Foerster about Dozerman's missing gun. At Homicide, Bunk canvasses for witnesses in the shootings and is told that Omar was present. Landsman tells Bunk to interrogate some prisoners who have promised to exchange information on the gun in exchange for leniency, but he finds the ordeal to be a waste of time. In the Western, Colvin decides to coerce dealers and crew chiefs into moving their corner operations to Hamsterdam. Despite initially being unable to find any intelligence on the high-level dealers, Colvin gets what he needs when he is put in touch with the Major Case Unit. McNulty arrives and gets a warm greeting from Colvin, his former commander. Colvin orders his men to bring in drug lieutenants, telling Carver he can sympathize with their position as middle management. Carver and Herc are tasked with bringing in Marlo, but they find him surrounded by soldiers and refusing to move. Carver realizes the danger they are in and has them withdraw. Meanwhile, Officer Anthony Colicchio has picked up Bodie. At Hamsterdam, Colvin tells the lieutenants that they will be allowed to operate freely within the three drug-tolerant zones, but will be arrested if they do business anywhere else. Herc, Carver and Colicchio staff one of the Hamsterdam zones and are tasked with rounding up drug addicts for the dealers, one of whom is Johnny. Cutty returns to work checking on the dealer that Slim Charles suspects of stealing from the Barksdales. Cutty leaves the crew to meet an appointment with The Deacon, who tells him that he will have to work to find a job but that he can help him get into a GED program. Cutty, having thought Grace would be present, leaves the church. After snorting cocaine with Gerard and Sapper, Cutty is put in touch with an old man who helps him cheat a urine test. When Cutty's crew confronts the girlfriend of the suspected dealer, Cutty slaps her. However, Cutty is appalled when Gerard and Sapper beat the dealer into unconsciousness. Bell chairs a meeting of the New Day Co-Op in compliance with Robert's Rules of Order. Afterwards, he angrily admonishes Shamrock for taking down notes of the meeting. Later, Shamrock picks up the newly paroled Avon from prison. Bodie reports to a suspicious Bell about what is going on with Hamsterdam. After meeting with Marlo and failing to reach any compromise, Bell attends Avon's welcome party and talks business with Levy, Krawczyk, and Senator Davis. Avon spots Gerard and Sapper coming into the party high and has them thrown out. Bell shows Avon his new apartment, telling him they have enough legitimate money to put whatever they like out in the open under their own names. In the MCU, Bubbles tells Greggs more about Marlo's organization and names Chris Partlow as his chief bodyguard. He gives Greggs a disposable phone previously used by Fruit. McNulty continues following Bell and approaches him in his copy shop. Bell responds by brazenly offering to sell him a condominium in his development, to which McNulty states his disappointment as he had high hopes for their continuing game of cat and mouse. McNulty tells Prez and Freamon that Bell has become \\"the bank\\" - working legitimate businesses to produce funds to buy packages of narcotics for distribution that he will never touch. Greggs tracks down Marlo and finds Bell visiting him at his headquarters. Inside, Bell tries to persuade Marlo to join the Co-Op and is met with silent treatment. After Bell leaves, Marlo tells his people to gather weapons. While attending an open house event at his sons' school, McNulty encounters D'Agostino doing fundraising work. The two flirt and end up having a one night stand. However, D'Agostino rejects McNulty's further advances after they have sex, turning her full attention immediately to her work. Meanwhile, Omar's crew prepare weapons for their next heist. Tension is still high between Dante and Kimmy over the former's accidental killing of Tosha. Omar warns them that they must get along or leave the crew. Production=Title reference The title refers to Cutty's choice between going straight and returning to his old life as a soldier, Stringer's attempts to pose as a legitimate business man, Carcetti's \\"honest appeal\\" to Mayor Royce, and Bubbles' aspirations of saving money as a professional informant. Epigraph McNulty makes this statement expressing his disappointment at losing a worthy target after approaching Stringer and finding that he is now mostly straight. This also can be applied to Colvin's initial attempts to move the drug dealers into the free zones, as well as Stringer's failure to convince Marlo to join the New Day Co- Op.

In 1955 Beechcraft designed the Model 1001, as the initial version of this target drone was designated, in response to a US Navy requirement for gunnery and air-to-air combat training. Production of the type began in 1959, with the drone being given the Navy designation of KDB-1, later MQM-39A. The Model 1001 led to the similar Model 1025 for the US Army, which gave it the MQM-61A designation. Beech also designed a variant powered by a turbojet engine and designated Model 1025-TJ, but nobody bought it. The MQM-61A was a simple monoplane with a vee tail. It was substantially larger than the MQM-36 Shelduck, and powered by a 94 kW (125 hp) McCulloch TC6150-J-2 flat-six, air-cooled, two-stroke piston engine driving a two-blade propeller. It could tow banners or targets of its own, with two targets under each wing, and also carried scoring devices. Launch was by RATO booster, recovery was by parachute.

Alistrati is mentioned in 1460 in a manuscript of the holy Convent of Ikosifissa Pageo as a small town. A traveler from Turkey mentions it with the name Al-Strati in about 1650. There are many views about the etymology of the word \\"Alistrati\\". It is said that it comes from the Archistratigos (Michael - Gabriel). Belfry of Agios Athanasios orthodox church, at Alistrati. Other people believe that the first name was \\"Alistrate\\" which means among streets. Some people give her the meaning of the street towards the sea, through Fillipi. According to the tradition, the name of the town, Alistrati, comes from \\"Agios Eustratios\\", the name of a saint, because it is believed that Alistrati was built on the ruins of a church devoted to Agios Eustratios. Alistrati was built by the people of the ancient town Alektrioupolis, situated 2 km southwest from Alistrati, where the Monastery of Agia Kyriaki is now located. That town lived until the mids of the 19th century as a small settling near the big number of roosters, which crew and made their presence audible in the area around. When the town was struck by an epidemic at the beginning of the Turkish occupation, most of the inhabitants moved to the today's Alistrati place. At the beginning Alistrati was a small village, but it soon changed into a small town because of its geographical position and the merchandise, as well. It enjoyed great prosperity during the Turkish domination as it was a tobacco's industry centre and the religious and cultural centre of East Macedonia. After the revolution of 1821 against Turkish occupation, it was a transport and trade station between the area Serres-Drama-Kavala and a business and trade activity had developed. It had also developed into an intellectual and religious center especially after it had been the seat of the See of Fillipi-Drama and Zichni (one can see the graves of three prelates in the yard of the Ag. Athanasios church) and after the establishing of the famous for that time Greek Central School of Alistrati where pupils from all the area of eastern Macedonia came to study. central square of Alistrati.Today Alistrati attracts tourists not only because of the tourist cave but because of all the natural environment around it as well. The small neighborhoods with the narrow streets and the typical up-hill alleys, the hospitable inhabitants, the nice old Square, the belfry and the elaborate old reredos of the church of Agios Athanasios are tokens of the inhabitant's taste. There are also a lot of houses built in neoclassical or Macedonian architecture and picturesque narrow streets. So as the visitor strolls around the village he can travel back into time. Visitors can enjoy their stay here in some nice places, such as Hotel Boziki or the hotel run by the Women Cooperative etc. All these places meet the visitors‚Äô update needs. There are also many cafes, and tavernas with delicious, traditional dishes. And all these things combined with the excellent climate (there is very low humidity) help the visitors have a great time and escape from their everyday life routine. Alistrati's Caves and Aggitis Ravine The old bridge of Aggitis River. According to the Greek Mythology, the Sphinx was appearing near the ravine of Aggitis river in the area of \\"Petroto\\". It's also been said that Pluto, master of Hades, when he had kidnapped Persephone, daughter of goddess Demeter led her to the ravine where it's believed that there were the Gates of the Underworld. The specific area which is mentioned in these Greek Myths is the same one near the Alistrati's Caves. The Alistrati cave lies about 6 km southeast of Alistrati's town at a place called \\"Petroto\\". The expanse of the area is almost 14.000m2. The antechamber of the cave is 8 m height. It's from this point that start different high galleries folly decorated with stalactites and stalagmites. The main branches of the cave are developed to the left and to the right of the entrance starting from a huge chamber, the Teception Chamber of a width of 60 m, a length of 100 m and height of 20-30m. It's in this chamber that nature decided to demonstrate its power in creating ornaments. What fascinates the most is the huge stalactites and those pure white forming draperies. There are other chambers and their height is quite the same 8-10m. From the reception chamber and towards the left, emerges a second passage, quite parallel to the first. In this gallery there are even some red stalagmites which are called \\"The flames\\". The height of these formations reaches 35 m. Somewhere in this passages the two main passages join each other and continue with an always increasing width and height while from the ceiling one can see suspended huge and majestic stalactites of a height of 15 m. Inside the cave there are countless floors which are still unknown. Very impressive is the big variety of stalactites and stalagmites inside the cave mostly because of the difference of their shapes and their age. The older stalactites are mainly in the galleries which are on the right side of the entrance. On the other hand, the \\"infant\\" stalactites on the left side of entrance. *Stalactites: They are the limestone tubular formations which are growing from the ceiling and downwards. Their length fluctuates between few centimetres and many metres. *Stalagmites: They are formed as the water drops, which carry acid carbonate, fall on the ground under a stalactite. When a stalactite meets a stalagmite, we have a new formation which is called \\"column\\" *Helictites: It's a rear kind of stalactite which is developed on the sides, on the floors even on the ceilings of the caves, towards many directions (up, side and down). *Shields: They are being developed as the water comes out through very thin fissures of the rock. Many times their diameter is of some metres. *Cave Pearls: They are small formations like spheres *Gours: They are another kind of formation which is also very interesting. Small barriers of calcium carbonate which are placed on the floor of the cave. The creation depends on the rainfall in the area of the cave. On Gour evolve a rear fauna. The \\"egg- shaped \\" and the \\" Tumour - shaped \\" are different kinds of formatious. They are dark - coloured and usually found shaped. The \\" Cauliflower- like formation is another type of cave deposites. We can find them usually on the main body of a stalactite or a stalaguite.And finally the \\" Heccendrites in a variety of shapes. The cave is placed 50 km away from Serres, 25 km from Drama and 55 km from Kavala. It is considered to be the most decorated cave in Greece where nature revealed its power in creating ornaments and rock formations. At a distance of 250 m from the southern part of the entrance of the cave the railway line from Serres to Drama passes. Near the railway line and on the southern side of it is the Aggitis river. As a result of the waterflow of the river the limestone layers of the mountain has been corroded and the ravine of Aggitis river has been shaped. The visitor in Alistrati apart from the cave can enjoy the river Aggitis which flows through the villages of Symvoli, Lefkothea and R.S. Aggista, forming idyllic river by zones with rich plantation. Many connoisseur fishermen combine their hobbies with walks and pic-nic in the countryside. The area is suitable for rafting and Kanoye. It is a few meters further down the railways which pass beside the cave. The locals call it \\"Vraous\\". Sports Alistrati has one football team, Makedonikos Alistratis, which plays in the A2 Local Championship.

FC Kattowitz () was an ethnically German football club playing in what was Kattowitz, Silesia Province in Germany (now Katowice, Silesian Voivodeship, Poland) and was active during the inter-war period and World War II when the two countries struggled over control of the region. Established in 1905, the original club disappeared in 1945; a modern-day Polish club using the name 1. FC Katowice was formed in 2007.\\"1.

Enzyklop√§die des deutschen Ligafu√üballs 7. Vereinslexikon. Kassel: Agon-Sportverlag. . SV was the first football club in the region and was established at the initiative of local priests. One of the local organizers was Karol Walica, whose father brought the first leather football to the city from Berlin. Preu√üen was one of three clubs that followed out of SV, alongside Germania Kattowitz and Diana Kattowitz, that formed the short-lived Kattowitzer Ballspiel-Verband (KBV, en:Kattowitz Ballgame Association). The team claimed that league's only championship in 1905. Top- flight football in the region was dominated by the Verband Breslauer Ballspiel-Vereine (VBB, en:Association of Breslau Ballgame Clubs, 1903‚Äì06) and the Verband Niederlausitzer Ballspielvereine (VNB, en:Association of Niederlausitz Ballgame Clubs, 1904‚Äì06). These two associations merged in 1906 to form the regional S√ºdostdeutschland Fu√üballverband (SOFV, en:Southeast German Football Association) and FC Preu√üen became part of the league in the 1906‚Äì07 season. The team advanced to the league final in 1908 and 1909 where they were defeated in turn by VfR Breslau (5:2) and SC Alemannia Cottbus (3:2). They made another appearance in the final in 1913 and beat Askania Forst 2:1, however, Forst protested the result and beat Kattowitz 4:0 in the re-play.Gr√ºne, Hardy (1996). Vom Kronprinzen bis zur Bundesliga. Kassel: AGON Sportverlag The outbreak of World War I in 1914 led to the suspension of championship play in the SOFV until the 1919‚Äì20 season. Play in Poland in the 1920s and 1930s Logo of 1. FC Kattowitz, ca. 1922 After the war and the re-establishment of a Polish republic, Upper Silesia was the subject of a territorial dispute between Germany and Poland. Following the Silesian Uprisings in 1921 and a subsequent League of Nations plebiscite, part of the region ‚Äì including Kattowitz ‚Äì was granted to Poland and the name of the city was changed to Katowice. The football club was caught up in the politically charged events of the period. In 1920‚Äì21 Preu√üen was still part of German football competition in the SOFV. The season ended with Vereinigte Breslauer Sportfreunde, Viktoria Forst, and Kattowitz in a three-way tie for first place separated only by goal difference, which was not at the time considered decisive. A playoff was organized to determine which of the three clubs would take part in the German national playoffs. Kattowitz was unable to participate because of passport problems and Forst ultimately went on to represent the SOFV. A separate playoff was later held to determine which of the three clubs would be S√ºdostdeutschland champions. Breslau won both of their matches ‚Äì including a 5:1 victory over Preu√üen ‚Äì to claim the title. With the transfer of the city of Katowice to Poland, the name of the club was Polonized in 1922 to 1. Klub Sportowy Katowice. That same year, the membership of the club successfully challenged the change in court and won the right to play as 1. FC Kattowitz. By 1924, the team was part of regional Polish competition and playing as 1. FC Katowice. It soon emerged as one of the strongest teams in the country and finished second to Wis≈Ça Krak√≥w in the first season of Poland's newly established national competition in 1927. Katowice lost a crucial match 0:2 at home to Wis≈Ça During this period Katowice was well known for its excellent players: goalkeeper Emil Goerlitz, who was the first footballer from Upper Silesia to play for the Polish national team; defender Erich Heidenreich, regarded as one of the best backs in Europe, who refused to play for Poland citing his German heritage; and forward Karol Kossok, another Polish national who went on to become the top scorer for the clubs Cracovia Krak√≥w and Pogo≈Ñ Lw√≥w. The team's most famous player was Ernest Willimowski, who started his career with Katowice, but was sold to Ruch Chorz√≥w in 1933, and appeared with both the Polish and German national squads. Katowice faltered in 1929 and was relegated from first division Polish football, descending to play in the regional Silesian league where they became champions in 1932. They went on to the promotion round playoffs against the winners of the Krak√≥w league (Podgorze Krak√≥w) and Kielce league (Warta Zawiercie). The Katowice side twice beat Warta (5:2, 6:2), but also twice lost to Podgorze (1:2, 1:3). As a result, Podgorze qualified for the central playoffs, and later went on the national league. Play under the Third Reich in the 1940s In June 1939, the club's activities were suspended by Polish authorities when they were accused of promoting and supporting the interests of Nazi Germany. After the German invasion of Poland which began World War II in the fall of 1939, the team resumed play with German authorities looking to hold up 1. FC Kattowitz as a model side in Upper Silesia for propaganda purposes. In 1933, German football was reorganized under the Third Reich into sixteen top-flight Gauligen. With the onset of the war, existing divisions were expanded or additional divisions were formed to incorporate conquered territories. Citing the club's \\"excellent fighting spirit during the Polish- time\\",Gr√ºne, Hardy (1996). Vom Kronprinzen bis zur Bundesliga. Kassel: AGON Sportverlag Nazi sporting authorities advanced 1. FC to the Gauliga Schlesien in 1940 without their having to qualify competitively, unlike other teams in the region. Kattowitz earned a third-place result in the 1940‚Äì41 campaign. The division was split the following year into the Gauliga Niederschlesien and the Gauliga Oberschlesien, where 1. FC played until the end of the war. The club attracted players such as Ewald Dytko, Pawe≈Ç Cyganek, Erwin Nyc and Wilimowski to its ranks, but was never able to overtake rival Germania K√∂nigsh√ºtte, instead struggling as a lower table side that was unable to develop into a propaganda show piece as authorities had hoped. The club's last known match was a 1:2 loss to Preu√üen Hindenburg on 14 January 1945. A game scheduled for a week later versus TuS Schwientochlowitz was never played and by 27 January Soviet Red Army troops occupied the city.http://www.sport.pl/sport/1,69628,2513349.html 1\\\\.

Costume design often changed between various television series and films, especially those representing different time periods, both for appearance and comfort. Deliberately mixing styles of uniforms from the various series was occasionally used to enhance the sense of time travel or alternative universes. Christopher Pike was different from what eventually became the standard design. Men are in ribbed turtlenecks and women in cowl neck variations. Both had a gray jacket Rank and insignia The rank system of the Star Trek universe resembles that of the United States Navy and many Commonwealth of Nations navies, in contrast to other science fiction franchises that use an army ranking system. In Star Trek: The Original Series (TOS) and Star Trek: The Motion Picture, ranks are indicated by sleeve stripes. While these were originally planned to follow the U.S. Navy and Coast Guard model, to avoid an overly flashy or militaristic look the pattern was modified. Thus a Starfleet captain‚Äôs insignia resembles that of a naval lieutenant commander, a Commander‚Äôs insignia resembles a naval lieutenant, and so forth, down to an ensign who wears no sleeve insignia. In later movies based on The Original Series, ranks are indicated by pins on a shoulder strap and the left sleeve. These are unique symbols for each rank like those worn universally by officers in all branches of the U.S. Armed Forces. In most later television series, ranks are indicated by varying numbers of gold or black dots (‚Äúpips‚Äù) or bars worn on the uniform collar. These more closely follow the naval officer pattern, with gold pips equating to a whole stripe and black pips equating to a half stripe. The rank, and specifically the various insignia in TOS has caused much confusion. Indeed, this confusion led to a production mistake very early on in the show‚Äôs first season. The costume designer, William Theiss, had noticed that in previous episodes there were personnel from another ship who wore unique insignia. As this was so early in Star Trek‚Äôs production, Theiss understandably interpreted the different insignia as meaning that every individual starship had its own insignia and created a unique design for the USS Exeter, in the episode ‚ÄúThe Omega Glory‚Äù. Before the episode aired, Bob Justman (producer) was reviewing footage from the episode and noticed the costume anomaly. Bob consulted with Gene Roddenberry who clarified that all starship personnel are to wear the delta insignia as seen on the Enterprise crew uniform. It was too late in production to fix the mistake, but Bob sent out a very friendly memo pointing out the error, stating that going forward all starship personnel are to wear the delta insignia. The memo then went on to clarify that the different insignia seen in the episode ‚ÄúCharlie X‚Äù was a designation for merchant marines or freighter personnel. Going forward, the delta symbol remained consistent for all starship personnel, as we see in ‚ÄúCourt Martial‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Tholian Web‚Äù. Unfortunately, this single production mistake has caused much confusion within the fan community, as well as another production mistake decades later. There is a fan theory that each ship has its own unique insignia and that Starfleet only universally adopted the delta symbol in honour of the Enterprise returning from its very successful five year mission. This fan theory also led to a production mistake in the Star Trek: Enterprise episode ‚ÄúIn a Mirror Darkly‚Äù where we see what happens to the lost USS Defiant that first appeared in the original series episode ‚ÄúThe Tholian Web‚Äù. Even though in ‚ÄúThe Tholian Web‚Äù we see the crew of the Defiant wearing the delta insignia the Star Trek: Enterprise costume designers created a unique insignia for the Defiant uniform. During the TOS era, there were six duty insignia: # Starship duty insignia # Spacecraft duty insignia (auxiliary fleet/merchant marine) # Outpost duty insignia # Cadet duty insignia # Starbase duty insignia # Fleet Command insignia The fleet command insignia has also likely added to the confusion because we see Commodore Matt Decker wearing it while in command of the USS Constellation (\\"The Doomsday Machine\\" TOS). As a Commodore, Decker is a flag officer and the Constellation is his flagship. He is the only flag officer we get to see in permanent command of a starship, so he wears the fleet command insignia to denote his unique status. In all other Star Trek series and movies, the delta insignia is universal regardless of duty posting. Original series The original uniform designs were the product of designer William Ware Theiss. The original series uniforms consisted of a colored top and dark pants, with significant variations between the designs used in the pilot episodes and the rest of the series. Pilots The first uniforms, as seen in the unaired pilot \\"The Cage\\" (footage was re-used in a later episode, \\"The Menagerie\\") and again in the second pilot \\"Where No Man Has Gone Before\\", are somewhat different from the Starfleet uniform seen in the rest of the original series. The original concept used a heavy, ribbed turtle neck collar of the same color as the tunic for the men, with a cowl neck variation for the women, each in three colors: gold, beige (\\"sand\\"), and light blue. Officers in the first Star Trek pilot, \\"The Cage,\\" wore a single solid gold sleeve stripe, and only the officer grades of \\"lieutenant\\" and \\"captain\\" were used in dialog. A \\"chief\\" was also visible, but wearing a different sleeve stripe, consisting of two thin lines encircling the cuff, with a wavy gold line appearing above and below these lines. Characters addressed as \\"crewman\\" wore no sleeve insignia. In the first pilot, the uniforms also included gray coats with silver rank stripes on the sleeves, worn on away missions and identical for men and women, and an optional gray cap. In the second pilot episode, \\"Where No Man Has Gone Before,\\" most officers again wore a single stripe; Captain James T. Kirk wore two stripes. The rank indicators used in the pilots and the main series differed because creator Gene Roddenberry and wardrobe designer William Ware Theiss had not yet worked out a consistent system for officer- grade indicator markings on the uniforms. This they would do after the second pilot, \\"Where No Man Has Gone Before,\\" succeeded in selling the series. Star Trek: The Original Series Miniskirt uniform Examples of uniforms from the Original Series The original uniform material was velour. This was used in the first and second seasons because it was cheap and easy to care for, but it shrank after it was dry-cleaned, and it tore easily. It was replaced in the third season by a nylon fabric used in professional baseball uniforms. Differently colored shirts were worn with dark gray trousers ‚Äî which appeared black on camera ‚Äî for the men. While the two pilot episodes depict women wearing trousers, most female Starfleet personnel wear more revealing costumes after a request from NBC; Grace Lee Whitney suggested miniskirts. William Shatner observed that Star Trek, \\"to the appreciation of all the men on the set, in fact all around the world, would boast the shortest skirts on women of any regular series on television\\". Miniskirt-length dresses (of the same materials and colors as the shirts) with cheer briefs and dark tights were worn by the women. Black boots were worn by both sexes. Nichelle Nichols did not believe that the miniskirts were unusually short or revealing: On certain occasions, the characters would wear dress uniforms (TOS: first shown in \\"The Menagerie\\" and later used in \\"Court Martial,\\" \\"Space Seed,\\" \\"Journey to Babel,\\" and \\"The Savage Curtain\\") that are made of a shinier fabric, presumably a polyester satin, and are decorated with gold piping and colored badges that vary depending on rank. Montgomery Scott's dress uniform, especially as seen in \\"The Savage Curtain,\\" includes a Scottish tartan. Specifically, it is the tartan of the Clan Scott, one of Scotland's oldest clans. Jumpsuits in the same colors with black undershirts were also worn, mostly by background characters. Beginning with the first regular series episode \\"The Man Trap\\", the department colors were slightly altered from the pilot versions: command and helm personnel wear gold shirts; operations, engineering and security personnel wear red; and science and medical personnel wear blue, all with black collars and undershirts.\\"The Man Trap\\" The most commonly used Command Section shirts were actually olive-green in color, but they appeared to be a golden-yellow color called tenn√© both under the lights used on the set and in the post-development film stock. In later series, the gold color was canonized in dialog. However, some uniforms - the alternate shirts worn by Captain Kirk, and the Command Section dress uniforms - were made of a different material which, while the same color, showed up as olive- green even under the lights and when photographed.\\"The Cage\\" and \\"Where No Man Has Gone Before\\" The green shirts (seen in TOS: \\"The Trouble with Tribbles\\", \\"Charlie X\\" and \\"The Immunity Syndrome\\") may have the rank stripes on the sleeves or on the collar (TOS: \\"The Enemy Within\\"), and always feature the Enterprise assignment patch near the waist as a belt fastener. Rank stripes around the cuffs were still used to show rank, though more levels had been introduced to differentiate between ranks, and thus identify characters. For most characters, two types of stripe were used: one solid and one dotted; the solid stripe design appears to follow the design of the 'chief' stripe from \\"The Cage\\". Captain Kirk wore two solid stripes with a dotted stripe inbetween the two, Commanders (such as Spock) wore two stripes, Lieutenant Commanders (such as Scott and McCoy) wore one solid stripe and one dotted stripe, Lieutenants (such as Uhura and Sulu, as well as many background characters) wore one stripe, whilst Ensigns (such as Chekov and countless background characters) and all enlisted personnel had no stripes at all. Only once was there a rank shown for Lieutenant Junior Grade: a single dotted stripe. Commodores, when seen, wore a wide gold braid with a gold stripe above and below, but flag officers had no distinct uniform of their own. The frequent death of red-uniformed security officers led to the coining of the popular term \\"redshirt\\". Star Trek: The Animated Series Based on the success and increasing popularity of Star Trek in syndication, an animated version of the series was produced from 1973 to 1974. The uniforms depicted in this series matched the general parameters and appearance of those used in the live action series. The perception by fans of the command uniforms being yellow/gold instead of green, thanks to set lighting and other factors, resulted in the producers committing to a definitive gold-color for animation purposes. The command dress uniforms remained green to match the perceived colors represented by the live action series. However, the uniform pants were colored gray to match the actual fabric used in the live action series as opposed to the black they had appeared to be when filmed. Original film franchise The original plans for the aborted Star Trek: Phase II television series involved retaining TOS uniforms but when the project became Star Trek: The Motion Picture, they were replaced by a new design. Robert Fletcher continued this system when he designed the uniforms for Star Trek: The Motion Picture. The Motion Picture The film has multiple uniform styles, including one-piece jumpsuits, matching shirt and pants, and tunics either with buttons or a sash around the waist. All uniform variants include shoes (\\"foot coverings\\") built into the trousers. Some uniforms have short sleeves, while others are long- sleeved, with either standing, v-neck, or turnover collars. Uniforms come in gray, white, gray and white, blue, brown, and beige. On the Enterprise, the arrowhead still remains the symbol for all staff members, but the elongated star replaces the science department's circle and oval crossover and the ops department's 6-sided spiral. Divisions or section assignments are indicated by a colored circle behind the arrowhead, rather than the uniform color itself: red is for engineering, pale green for medical, orange for science, white for command, pale gold for operations, and gray for security. Most of the uniforms in the first movie also included a noticeable \\"perscan\\" (short for personal scanner) medical monitoring device, mentioned in the Gene Roddenberry novelization of The Motion Picture, which appears on the uniforms in the position where one would expect to see a belt buckle. Rank is indicated by braids on long sleeves or on shoulder boards, identical to TOS. However, in a departure from the TV series, a new ensign rank is indicated, as a dotted braid around the sleeves and on the shoulder boards; in TOS there were no ensign rank indicators of any kind. Non-commissioned officers wear a hollow gold square on the shoulder boards but not at the sleeves. New rank insignia for admirals are shown, in the shape of three solid braids side-by-side, followed by another solid braid on its own, with an 8-pointed star on the shoulder boards. There are fewer stripes than on U.S. Navy uniforms, because four stripes for a captain would have looked \\"too militaristic,\\" reflecting Roddenberry's insistence that the role of Starfleet was expressly not supposed to be military. Security guards wear white uniforms with brown helmets and breastplates. Engineers wear thick white spacesuits with large black ribbed collars. In The Making of Star Trek: The Motion Picture, Susan Sackett and Gene Roddenberry wrote that the uniforms were redesigned because the bright colors of the 1960s original, so vibrant on television, would distract viewer attention on the big screen. The designs proved unpopular with their wearers, and when he took over as producer of the motion pictures, Harve Bennett ordered the uniforms redesigned because he did not want \\"an all-gray crew on an all-gray ship.\\" Films II‚ÄìGenerations Uniform exemplar from The Wrath of Khan on display at Star Trek: The Experience Fletcher redesigned the costumes for Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan. This design is used in the following movies, up to Star Trek Generations, and variations appear in some flashback scenes of Star Trek: The Next Generation and Star Trek: Voyager. In this version, Starfleet officers wear rank insignia on the shoulder strap and left sleeve just above the armband. A service bar is worn just below the sleeve rank pin, denoting how long the officer has served in Starfleet in five-year and ten-year increments. The second movie-era uniform consists of a burgundy (\\"blood\\") double-breasted jacket with a black stripe along a sealing mechanism (admirals also had smaller gold stripes below, the number depending on rank), with a colored strap over the right shoulder to close the tunic, attached to which is a rank pin. All uniforms include the command star arrowhead insignia from TOS, now adopted as the Starfleet emblem, on the left chest; officers have a white rectangular piece behind the arrowhead, while enlisted personnel do not. Characters also wear a black belt with a buckle shaped like the Starfleet arrowhead in a circle, complete with TOS command star. Departments are indicated by the color of the shoulder strap, arm band, and undershirt, rather than insignia. The colors include white for command; gold for engineering; gray for science, communications and navigation; dark green for security; light green for medical; dark blue for operations; light blue for special services; and red for low-grade officers and officer cadets. All officer uniforms have a division colored stripe on the trousers or skirt that matches the shoulder strap and service bar, except for command branch, whose stripes are red, rather than white. Instead of the foot coverings built into the trousers, this uniform design had black boots whose uppers were eight or ten inches high. This costume was nicknamed \\"The Monster Maroon\\" uniform because of the difficulty fans often encountered duplicating it. The Starfleet insignia as seen in the second through seventh Star Trek films An alternate \\"bomber\\" jacket was worn by Kirk and Scott, as well as Admiral Morrow (Star Trek III: The Search for Spock, Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home, Star Trek V: The Final Frontier). In later years Scotty would often remove the jacket altogether, simply wearing a black vest, with numerous pockets useful for an engineer, with his undershirt. Scotty's undershirt itself is inconsistent - he wears a white shirt (consistent with his rank of Captain) with the vest or bomber, but a gold one (used by Engineering crew) with his formal duty tunic. Security and engineering personnel wear armor and radiation suits respectively, similar to those worn in The Motion Picture, although security guards wear a red, turtle-necked uniform underneath (Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country). The engineering radiation suits have a colored collar (Star Trek II): black indicates officer, red indicates cadet. There is also a field jacket for away missions with several large pockets, arm patches, white ribbing and a large white turnover collar. Starfleet cadets in The Wrath of Khan wear the same uniforms as officers, but with bright red undershirts and a red shoulder strap instead of one indicating department. Enlisted personnel wear a one-piece red jumpsuit in a similar color to the officer uniform, with tan shoulders and upper chest and black undershirts. Enlisted trainees wear the same uniform, except with a red undershirt instead of a black one. (Star Trek II). Uniforms similar to this style are shown in the Next Generation television series, although without the turtleneck or belt (TNG: \\"Yesterday's Enterprise\\", \\"Dark Page\\", \\"Family, \\"Violations\\"). The Next Generation=Star Trek: The Next Generation The Starfleet officers and crewmembers seen in The Next Generation wear a jumpsuit with a Starfleet communicator badge (or 'combadge' as it was sometimes called) on the left chest and rank insignia on the right side of the collar. The black areas are seen on the shoulders and the pants, and the uniforms's sleeves and abdominal area are colored to indicate the individual's division, with red indicating command and helm; gold for engineering, security, and operations; and blue for science and medical (TNG: \\"Encounter at Farpoint\\"). The division colors for command and operations switched from those used in Enterprise and TOS while the division color for science stayed the same. In early episodes some crew members can be seen wearing a tunic version of the uniform with bare legs and boots (\\"skant\\"). Beverly Crusher often wears a blue laboratory coat over her standard uniform, beginning in TNG: \\"The Naked Now.\\" The lab coat was primarily developed to hide Gates McFadden's pregnancy. The blue tended to appear teal under certain lighting conditions in the later seasons and subsequent spinoffs. In some episodes of the later seasons, starting in TNG: \\"Darmok\\", Jean-Luc Picard would sometimes wear a different uniform that consisted of a gray shirt with black ribbed shoulders and collar with a \\"bomber jacket\\" that was red overall with black ribbed shoulders, often worn open or very loosely fastened. The uniforms could be fitted with pouches for carrying tricorders and Type 2 phasers on the waist, and the early versions had a small pocket built in on the left side of the waist for carrying a smaller Type 1 phaser when appearing openly armed was not desired. The removable gear pouches were also incorporated into the uniforms used in DS9 and the TNG-era films from First Contact onward. In the show's early seasons the uniforms were one-piece jumpsuits made of Spandex, and sized slightly too small so that they would be stretched when worn and provide a smooth appearance. But the cast members hated the uniform's painfully tight fit and lack of pockets, and after Patrick Stewart's chiropractor warned that they risked permanent injury, the actors persuaded the costumers to gradually replace them with wool uniforms. The wool uniforms, which most main cast members wear from the third season onward, are two-piece (tunic and pants) designs that lack colored piping on the shoulders and edges of the pant leg cuffs and have a raised collar. The collar of the tunic has a colored piping similar to that of the original diamond-shaped shoulder piping. The spandex uniforms continued to make appearances throughout TNG, usually worn by extras in various scenes. These were later altered to lack the piping on the shoulders and trouser hems and include a raised collar as a cost-cutting measure. Admirals wore numerous different uniform variations in the early years of TNG; a final design was settled on in the sixth season, featuring a jacket with gold piping along a centered front closure, and rank pips (indicating the number of \\"stars\\"), in gold squares on either side of the collar. The TNG dress uniform, which continued to be used in Deep Space Nine and Voyager, is a colored wraparound robe-like coat of a solid division color, save for black shoulders. The edges of the coats are piped in silver for field officers and in gold for flag officers. Other uniform designs appeared briefly in individual episodes, always following the theme of a colored or differentiated shoulder yoke. Examples include cadet uniforms in several episodes (including \\"The First Duty\\"). Wesley Crusher's 'Acting Ensign' gray costume was never specifically identified as a uniform, but it also exhibited a shoulder yoke design. Theiss, the costume designer from the original series, returned to design the initial TNG uniforms; they marked his last contribution to Star Trek wardrobe before he died. The costumes adopted from season 3 onward and later series' costumes were designed by Robert Blackman. TNG, DS9, Voyager captain insignia During all the shows set in the 24th century, a consistent insignia scheme is used for officers: a series of gold pips, either a solid color or an outline, worn on the right collar. After the first season of Star Trek: The Next Generation, a consistent scheme is also used for admiral insignia: a series of gold circles inside a black rectangle with a gold border worn on both collars. For the first season of TNG, admirals wear a different insignia, consisting of a triangle or stripe resembling gold weave along the right collar; one or two gold pips are sometimes underneath the weave. Three variants are visible in \\"Conspiracy\\": Admiral Quinn's insignia has no pips, Admiral Savar's has one, and Admiral Aaron's has two. A Starfleet insignia is worn on the left breast: this also functions as a communicator badge. This combadge insignia was redesigned for the movie Star Trek Generations (the only surviving part of a planned redesign of the uniforms), replacing the oval with a trapezoid with a cutout oval in the center. This new combadge is also used in Star Trek: Deep Space Nine from season three onward, and in Star Trek: Voyager. Cadet ranks are rarely ever seen, with the exception of the various visits from Wesley Crusher to the Enterprise in TNG. As it appears in those instances, it can be surmised that the insignia of a Cadet consists of one, two, three, or four copper and black bars, similar to those of a modern Lieutenant in the United States Army. It can also be surmised that if a cadet has one bar, he has one year at the academy, two bars for two years, and so on. Enlisted ranks are seen even less; their insignia are unclear. Star Trek: Deep Space Nine Deep Space Nine introduced a new style of uniform that appeared to run in parallel to the one seen on TNG. The new uniform comprised a single two-piece open-necked jumpsuit with the colored and black areas of the TNG uniform reversed (black torso/sleeves and colored shoulders) with the upper part being a removable jacket along with a visible zipper. The division colors use the same TNG scheme, though the science division is now blue-green. A grayish-indigo mock turtleneck undershirt was added, to which rank pips are affixed. The characters of Major Kira and Odo did not wear Starfleet uniforms, as they were part of the Bajoran militia. Throughout the run of DS9, ship-based Starfleet personnel continue to wear the older uniform design. Sisko also wore the TNG uniform on certain formal occasions, during his first arrival at DS9 (in the series pilot episode, \\"Emissary\\"), and when he was temporarily given the duties of \\"Head of Security\\" for Starfleet Headquarters on Earth (in the Season 4 episode, \\"Paradise Lost\\"). Admirals also retained the TNG style. A uniform similar to that appearing in the DS9 series can be seen in the TNG Season 3 episode \\"Allegiance\\", worn by the alien masquerading as a Starfleet cadet. The DS9 uniforms were first used in the premiere episode, \\"Emissary\\" and would continued to be used up to the Season 5 episode, \\"The Ascent\\". Following the release of Star Trek: First Contact, the new gray movie uniform design also appeared in DS9s fifth season and for the remainder of the series. However, the old DS9 uniform appears four more times following the introduction of the movie gray uniform design in the Season 5 episodes, \\"In Purgatory's Shadow\\" and \\"By Inferno's Light\\" worn by the real Dr. Julian Bashir while still being trapped in the Internment Camp 371 as well as the Season 7 episode, \\"Field of Fire\\" in a photograph and in the flashback scenes of the series finale, \\"What You Leave Behind\\". Star Trek Generations New uniforms were designed and made for the film Star Trek Generations, but were abandoned at the last minute. These included a fastening on the right side of the chest and a slightly more militaristic approach with rank bandings on the sleeves and a colored collar. The costumes for the female crew-members were different - instead of the additional fastening, there was a higher than previously seen black band around the waist. Nonetheless, Playmates Toys released a number of action figures wearing these planned uniforms. Generations instead has the crew wearing both TNG and DS9 uniforms, sometimes in the same scene (for instance, Worf and Riker in the battle against the Duras Sisters' Bird of Prey or Data and Geordi scanning the Amargosa Observatory for trilithium) as Jonathan Frakes and LeVar Burton had to borrow Avery Brooks and Colm Meaney's costumes respectively since the time was so short while there was enough time to make DS9-style costumes to fit on Patrick Stewart and Brent Spiner. However, Worf is the only male in the TNG crew to not wear the DS9 uniform in the film, although he would later join the DS9 crew in the fourth season of Deep Space Nine and none of the females wear the DS9 uniform in the film. As the film progresses, some characters can alternate between the TNG and DS9 uniforms and sometimes switch back to the old TNG uniforms (for instance, Picard switched back to the TNG uniform in the film's last scene). This would act as an introduction of the new design as standard shipboard wear for Star Trek: Voyager. The new style combadge (with the previous gold oval background replaced by a rectangular gold background with a cutout in the center) was also introduced for all uniform types. This combadge was subsequently adopted for DS9 (at the beginning of its third season) and Star Trek: Voyager. Star Trek: Voyager The crew in Star Trek: Voyager use the same uniforms seen in the early episodes of Deep Space Nine throughout the show's run. Because they were stuck in the Delta Quadrant and out of contact with Starfleet, the Voyager crew never made the switch to the updated uniform seen in later DS9 episodes and in the last three TNG films; they continued to use the old DS9 uniforms, although in the episode \\"Message in a Bottle\\" the EMH mark II is wearing the later DS9/movie gray TNG uniform. Starfleet personnel back in the Alpha Quadrant are seen wearing this uniform in later seasons of the show as well, when Voyager reestablishes contact with home. The crew also wears the TNG-style dress uniforms (VOY: \\"Course: Oblivion\\", \\"Someone to Watch Over Me\\", \\"One Small Step\\", \\"Ashes to Ashes\\"). B'Elanna Torres is sometimes seen wearing an overcoat over her normal uniform which matches the colors of her normal uniform, but has a pocket on the right breast for carrying small tools. The jacket was used in an attempt to hide actress Roxann Dawson's pregnancy. She wore it again when her character became pregnant, beginning in the episode \\"Q2\\". Voyager provisional Captain insignia Voyager used the new-style combadge and introduced 'provisional' rank insignia which consisted of a gold-metal- bordered enamel oval in the crewman's Branch color with diagonal black or gold bars to signify rank instead of the traditional pips. Provisional ranks were worn by the Maquis members of Voyagers crew, as they were ineligible to wear official Starfleet ranks. All ranks up to Captain appeared on screen; The Star Trek Encyclopedia showed them all to be analogous to the normal rank system. A black diagonal bar is equal to a black pip and a gold diagonal bar is equal to a gold pip. (e.g.: a yellow-enamel oval with one black bar and two gold bars signifies a Lieutenant-Commander in Operations, which is normally signified by one black pip and two gold pips.) The crew aboard the USS Equinox also use the same uniforms seen in the early episodes of Deep Space Nine as they are also stuck in the Delta Quadrant and out of contact with Starfleet (VOY: \\"Equinox (Parts I and II)\\"). The 29th-century officers in the Star Trek: Voyager episode \\"Relativity\\" wear chevron-like collar insignia (worn in a horizontal line like the pips and oriented pointing forwards towards the collar). Captain Braxton wears four gold chevrons (equivalent to four gold pips) and Lieutenant Ducane wears two gold chevrons (equivalent to two gold pips). The new Starfleet insignia is a silver diamond shape inset with a gold \\"Arrowhead\\" symbol facing to the left; this is probably a combination communicator and temporal beacon. The tunics have a quilted fabric in branch color on the right shoulder and sleeve (Blue for Command, Olive Drab Brown for Operations, and Gray for Sciences) and branch-color piping on the edge of the shoulder yoke. In \\"Living Witness\\", the crew was shown to be wearing black undershirts with a high collar (turtleneck style) instead of the usual grayish-indigo undershirts with a low collar, no combadges or rank insignia, while some were wearing black gloves including Captain Kathryn Janeway. This was in the context of historical records that wrongly asserted that Voyager‚Äôs crew had acted in a malign manner, until corrected by The Doctor, who was brought back to life 700 years in the future after a ‚Äúrelic‚Äù (containing a backup copy of his program) was discovered among wreckage and his program was recovered. Movies from Star Trek: First Contact on and later DS9 seasons Star Trek: First Contact introduces a new uniform style later adopted in DS9 (DS9: \\"Rapture\\"). This uniform features a colored turtleneck undertunic (with the same departmental color scheme as in earlier shows) covered by a black jacket with colored bands on the lower sleeves near the cuffs showing the wearer's division, the shoulders and upper chest of which are ribbed and made of thick, violet-gray material. Like the last two uniforms, the communicator badge is worn on the jacket, while rank pins are worn on the undertunic's collar. The pants are black. Star Trek: Insurrection also introduced a new dress uniform, consisting of a white jacket and black pants both with gold trim, a gray ribbed tunic (white tunic for flag officers and captains), and rank insignia on the collar of the tunic with the combadge worn in the customary location on the jacket. Unlike the previous uniform, it was the same color regardless of the wearer's division, save for colored bands on the lower sleeves like the standard uniform. It also appeared in the DS9 episode \\"Inter Arma Enim Silent Leges\\". Captains also had the option of a more casual uniform vest of the same basic design, though the violet-gray extended much lower. As depicted in Insurrection, a new admiral's duty uniform was shown, looking similar to those worn by officers, and yet containing markers to set it apart from the ordinary. The stripes on the jacket cuffs are double the width of those on the officer's jacket, and they show the admiral's rank insignia. The jacket also has gold edging. Furthermore, the admiral's uniform incorporates a belt, whose buckle is either a plain gold rectangle, as seen frequently in DS9, or a gold oval with an image of the United Federation of Planets' Seal, as was the case with Admiral Dougherty from Insurrection. Ancillary uniform Starfleet personnel fighting in ground battles appear in the DS9 episodes \\"...Nor the Battle to the Strong\\" and \\"The Siege of AR-558\\". They wear one-piece black uniforms with divisional stripes across the chest. Alternative timelines In the TNG episode \\"All Good Things...\\", an alternate timeline showed a uniform with the full color shirt (including shoulders). The same colors were used and the rank insignia would be shown above the right breast over a black line which cut off the shoulder area. These uniforms would also make an appearance in the Star Trek: Deep Space Nine episode \\"The Visitor\\" and the Star Trek: Voyager episode \\"Endgame\\". These episodes also included a new combadge design where the starfleet arrow was just an outline surrounded by two gold vertical bars. This badge was also worn by Geordi La Forge in the Star Trek: Voyager episode \\"Timeless\\" but on the gray shoulder uniform used in the last three TNG movies and the later episodes of Deep Space Nine. The Star Trek: The Next Generation episode \\"Parallels\\" used an alternate combadge design where rank was denoted by the number of bars behind the arrowhead. Variations in uniforms and insignia are occasionally used as plot devices in the various series. In the episode \\"Future Imperfect\\", the insignia are slightly altered so as to convince a character that 16 years have passed. In the episode, \\"Parallels\\", variations in uniforms and insignia suggest a meeting of characters from different parallel universes. Prequel era=Star Trek: Enterprise Sailors of the Year for the year 2001 in Enterprise uniforms with members of the cast. Photo courtesy of US Navy In Enterprise, field officers and crewmembers wear duty uniforms consisting of a dark long-sleeved undershirt and blue jumpsuit with colored piping around the shoulders and, occasionally, baseball caps. There is also a desert uniform with khaki pants and white shirt. Both uniforms have a United Earth Starfleet patch (featuring the stylized arrowhead emblem) on the right upper arm, and a patch left upper arm denoting the ship one is serving on. Enterprise, set before all other incarnations, did not include characters who hold the ranks of lieutenant commander or lieutenant, junior grade. The highest-ranking admiral seen wears two sets of three-pip insignia. Division colors follow the original TOS scheme, with command and flight control officers wearing gold piping, engineering, communications, and security officers wearing red piping, and medical and science officers (including linguists) wearing blue piping. Throughout the series, men and women wear the same type of uniform. Unlike the other series' uniforms, standard uniforms on Enterprise include zip-up pockets, and the undershirt is buttoned at the neck - while Gene Roddenberry had explicitly forbidden such devices as buttons and zippers on Starfleet uniforms, believing they would be obsolete in the future, designer Bob Blackman consciously used them as a way of dating the series, implying that closures Roddenberry envisioned had not been invented yet. Blackman described the jumpsuits as \\"more like a NASA flight suit\\" than the previous Starfleet costumes, and actors from other Star Trek shows envied the Enterprise actors' much more comfortable and conventional outfits. On certain occasions, Enterprise characters wear dress uniforms similar to the blue jumpsuit, decorated with the same pattern of colored piping, but lacking the zip-up pockets and combined with a white long-sleeved undershirt and, sometimes depending on rank, a white tie. Rank insignia on duty uniforms are worn on right side of shoulders only, but rank insignia on dress uniforms are worn on both sides. Also, there are two different kinds of field jackets worn on away missions. They have zippered pockets and the same colored pipings as the jumpsuits, as well as cold weather gear, pressure suits, spacesuits, an EV undersuit, and a royal blue undergarment with slight differences on male and female garments. During the series, T'Pol is almost never seen wearing the standard uniform although she is a commissioned officer in Starfleet, and often considered to be the first officer. The only times she wears the uniform is in the episode \\"Twilight\\" (featuring an alternate timeline) and briefly (as a disguise) in \\"Hatchery\\".  Star Trek: Discovery  In 2017's Star Trek: Discovery, set ten years prior to Star Trek: The Original Series, the uniform underwent another redesign. Like its Enterprise predecessor, a blue uniform was worn, with a shirt-trouser combination with a single collar on the left side. A large zipper fastens the front of the shirt, and pants pockets have zippers as well. Repeating patterns of tiny delta insignias ran down the sides of the uniforms, its colors denoting the wearer's division. The classic yellow, blue, red combination was eschewed in favor of gold, silver and copper for command, sciences and operations respectively. Ranks were embedded onto the Starfleet Delta, along with gold shoulder stripes for captains and shoulder stripes plus gold shoulder markings for admirals, and following the same standard as Star Trek: The Next Generation style rank insignias. \\"Reboot\\" films J.J. Abrams' Star Trek series takes place in a parallel universe called the \\"Kelvin timeline\\". Star Trek (2009 film) The 2009 Star Trek film features uniforms reminiscent of the original television series but with some cosmetic changes. The badge (already the logo of the full Starfleet instead of specific to the Enterprise) is now a pin rather than sewn on and comes in silver-metal for officers and gold-metal for admirals. The tops are now in two layers: a wide-collared colored over-shirt (gold, blue, or red just as in the original series) with a quilted pattern and a colored hem- line from the neck to the armpit, and a black undershirt, visually imitating the black collar of the original TOS design. The over-shirt has the division delta badge shape printed onto the fabric providing a textured appearance. Rank is indicated by 1 to 4 silver metallic-cloth bands worn above the overshirt's cuffs (1 for lieutenants, 2 for commanders, 3 for captains, and 4 for flag officers). As in the original series, female officers wear dresses, some with short sleeves (seen on Lt. Uhura), others with long sleeves (as seen on some of the background extras). Also, a number of women onboard can be seen wearing the long sleeve top and pants uniform similar to those worn in \\"The Cage\\". Unlike other Trek, this uniform is worn only aboard starships - other personnel wear black one-piece uniforms of a much more \\"military\\" appearance. In an unexplained change from previous series, many female crew members wear nail polish (Uhura wears black polish, while many extras wear red). Dress uniforms for academy cadets and staff are crimson, while flag officers (fleet captains and admirals) use a gray uniform with a white false-plastron front. The design is similar to that in The Motion Picture, stated by designer Michael Kaplan in the book Star Trek: The Art of the Film to be a deliberate homage. Rank is indicated by 1 to 5 paired diamond-shaped silver-metal \\"pips\\" worn on the tunic's shoulder-boards (ensigns wear 1 paired pip, lieutenants wear 2 paired pips, commanders wear 3 paired pips, captains wear 4 paired pips, and flag officers wear 5 paired pips). Star Trek Into Darkness (2013 film) The uniforms in the second J. J. Abrams Star Trek film are developed further. The formal uniform for Starfleet officers on the ground is shown to be a mid-gray in color and a similar style to the red uniforms worn by the academy cadets in the first film. A more informal uniform jumpsuit is worn at various points by several characters (including Kirk and Scotty). These jumpsuits have high collars and are made of a dark gray fabric, with triangles of transparent plastic at the collarbones which show the color of the officer's regular uniform shirt beneath. The personnel on the USS Vengeance wear a different duty uniform from the norm. It consists of black trousers and undershirt, with a quilted blue overshirt with long black sleeves and black cloth epaulets. This might either be the uniform of a private armed security or military contractor company hired by Marcus through Section 31 or the duty uniform for Section 31 itself (the blue indicating its Research & Development wing). Admiral Marcus' rank on this uniform is indicated by a wide silver band over a narrow silver band and under two narrow silver bands on the cuff; this might be the duty uniform insignia for a Commodore. Rank for admirals (as worn by Admiral Alexander Marcus) is indicated by 1 to 5 paired diamond-shaped gold-metal \\"pips\\" worn on the flag officer tunic's shoulder-boards. Marcus is described as a fleet Admiral (usually equivalent to a NATO five-star military rank) and wears 5 paired gold pips on his shoulder-boards. There are other ranks mentioned in the movies (Kirk himself is offered the rank of Vice- Admiral in Star Trek: Beyond). If the rank scheme is similar to NATO ranks they would be: Commodores wear 1 paired gold pip, Rear Admirals wear 2 paired gold pips, Vice-Admirals wear 3 paired gold pips, and Admirals wear 4 paired gold pips. Alternatively, the rank of fleet captain (a senior grade of captain and brevet flag officer rank) is signified by 5 paired silver pips, and the rank of admiral is always signified by 5 paired gold pips regardless of grade. Other publications Some licensed Star Trek publications present some insignia that contradict the ones shown on screen or in other publications. For example, the second and third editions of The Star Trek Encyclopedia offer differing insignia for various Starfleet ranks. Images accessible at Additionally, some Star Trek publications, including officially licensed ones, posit additional ranks that are not seen or mentioned in live-action productions.

It is supposed to depict a die-hard supporter of statehood for Puerto Rico, whose passion for the subject and support of the New Progressive Party of Puerto Rico verges on the absurd. The character is loosely based on the archetypical Puerto Rican peasant, the jibaro, with a sizeable dose of Archie Bunker thrown in. Actually, the intentions of its creator are quite clear, to demonize and ridicule those who support statehood for Puerto Rico, since the character's creator is an ardent independence supporter. Eleuterio, the character Eleuterio Qui√±ones is reportedly a 75-year-old man, divorced from his Puerto Rican wife (who left him for an American drill sergeant), who lives in a blue house on the Camarones section of Guaynabo, Puerto Rico, along with his son Elpidio. Due to his passionate love for the United States he flies the Stars and Stripes in front of his house. Since he's the only one in the barrio with the American flag in his porch, his neighbors call the house \\"El Correo\\", \\"The Post Office\\" in Spanish. The house is blue, given Eleuterio's affiliation to the New Progressive Party of Puerto Rico, whose logo is blue. Don Eleuterio was depicted in the early incarnations of the character as a grumpy old man, easily angered by life's minor irritations. Recent incarnations depict him as less irritated (and more tolerant) than before. However, Eleuterio is still prone to fits of anger, and throws things quite loudly whenever he loses an argument and proof is shown to him, or when something personal happens to him that goes against his political philosophy (such as his son Elpidio joining a PDP campaign rally for a joyride, for example). Don Eleuterio despises the Puerto Rican culture, but is a direct product of it. His commentary on Puerto Rican culture is affected by his personal experiences as a native of Puerto Rico and as a World War II veteran (in the character's beginnings, more recently the Korean War is used as to keep up with time). However, he has never set a foot outside Puerto Rico. His experience with true American culture is limited to the time he was stationed at a local United States Army camp near his home during the war. As a consequence of this, he considers the proverbial destination of most recent Puerto Rican √©migr√©s, Orlando, Florida, to be the statehooders' equivalent of Mecca, with the giant Mickey Mouse-eared water tank near the entrance of Walt Disney World as the Kaabah. The character's name allegedly came from using the Bristol Almanac, a long- standing almanac popular to Latin America that is published by New York City soap maker Murray and Kemp, and is similar in concept to Poor Richard's Almanac, as a source of baby names. The Almanac lists the Catholic saints of each day, from which a name could be selected for a newborn depending on the day of his birth; in theory this puts Don Eleuterio's birthday as occurring on 20 February, the day of St. Eleutherius of Constantinople, and right after the consecutive (and purely coincidental) birthdays (17 February - 19 February) of three Puerto Rican governors: Luis A. Ferr√©, Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n and Roberto S√°nchez Vilella (in that order). Eleuterio hates his name, since it is decidedly non-American. In reality, Logro√±o used \\"Eleuterio\\" as a name to reinforce the character's Puerto Ricanness, since the coqu√≠, a frog native to Puerto Rico, has the scientific name of Eleutherodactylus coqui. Since the coqu√≠ has traditionally (and erroneously) been viewed as so local to Puerto Rico as to die if taken out of his habitat (proven wrong by its recent acclimatization to Hawaii), the name \\"Eleuterio\\" evokes a similar connotation. Don Eleuterio is in record as being homophobic, a misogynist, a hater of reggaet√≥n, and intolerant of Puerto Rican cuisine, and particularly \\"gandinga\\" (tripe) as the worst offender. He is also a racist, although a bit ashamed of being so since he is racially mixed himself. He uses the term people of color (which may be politically correct to some English language speakers but a derogatory euphemism in Spanish) to refer to blacks. He essentially considers most poor and young Puerto Ricans as being potential drug addicts. Yet, he claims constantly to be \\"completamente neutrarrrr\\" (sic), a phrase mispronounced on purpose to depict Eleuterio as lacking culture. However, none of these prejudices are openly vented by Don Eleuterio until the \\"right\\" opportunity comes about -most often when a news item is commented and Eleuterio takes off in a tangent that makes no sense when related to it. For example, his racism usually flows to the surface when commenting about the stereotypical incompatibility in sizes between the genitalia of multiracial couples. He commonly insults callers to his radio program as being \\"huelepega\\" (glue sniffers), and wonders when the offender is going to inject his dose of marijuana (sic) next. According to Eleuterio, the character's creator (Logro√±o, who Eleuterio claims to have no relation with) is a \\"tecato\\", a heroin addict. Eleuterio speaks very little English. He claims he will not say an English word in public, as to not humiliate any Puerto Ricans talking to him, but in reality he only uses two English phrases in daily conversation: \\"Yes\\" (with which he answers almost any question asked to him in English) and \\"An Sori\\" (\\"I Am Sorry\\"), the first phrase he says whenever he encounters any American. He begs for forgiveness to Americans for the poor use Puerto Ricans have made of everything the country \\"has bestowed\\" on Puerto Rico, from the English language to welfare, and on to hamburgers, hot dogs and apple pie. Eleuterio's trademark phrase, when praising anything American or pro-American, is the refrain of an old Pentecostal hymn in Spanish, \\"¬°Al√°balo, que Vive!\\" (\\"Praise -Him-, for -He- lives!\\"). A converse phrase he mentions when he is angry is \\"¬°Maldita sean los cue'nos (d)er Diablo!\\" (\\"Damn be the horns of the Devil!\\") Known, but not seen In theory, no one from the general public has ever seen Don Eleuterio. Whenever a television comedy sketch was featured where Eleuterio would be a part of, he would speak hidden inside his house, from behind a window. Reportedly this occurs because Eleuterio is ashamed of his kinky hair and dark skin. He blames the local tap water for his hair's coarseness; as for his skin color, he considers himself white,Wikipedia reference to \\"White (people), as perceived in Latin America along with 84% of the Puerto Rican population. In practice, Logro√±o dressed once as Eleuterio Qui√±ones (namely, as a Puerto Rican peasant) for a televised episode of Los Rayos Gamma where Silverio P√©rez's birthday was being held. This is the only known public appearance by Eleuterio ever recorded. In other public appearances, Logro√±o hides from view and uses a microphone to do the character as a voice-over. Political views In the character's beginning, Eleuterio was, first and foremost, an admirer of NPP leader Carlos Romero Barcel√≥, particularly Romero's stubborn strength as a populist contender against the Popular Democratic Party of Puerto Rico. His initial idea of Puerto Rican statehood resembled that of \\"j√≠baro statehood\\", the dual concept of Puerto Rican cultural preservation under statehood that Romero promoted in his book \\"Statehood is For The Poor\\". Therefore, Eleuterio would speak fondly of Puerto Rican food and music (namely, that of Rafael Hern√°ndez Mar√≠n) as a complement to American cultural icons such as Tommy Dorsey. Of course, this image would be taken to the extreme: Don Eleuterio claims that Burger King outlets would be physically deflated as a balloon and rolled, as to be taken out of the country as if they were a roll of linoleum, should independence ever be granted to Puerto Rico. As a Romero supporter, Eleuterio viewed the emergence of Pedro Rossell√≥ as NPP leader with great skepticism. As Rossell√≥ consolidated his leadership within the NPP, however, Eleuterio grew acceptant of the less Puerto Rican-centric view of the country Rossell√≥'s supporters had within the NPP. As time passed, Eleuterio started inviting political leaders to his radio program. Politicians from outside the NPP took these invitations in stride, but NPP leaders were hesitant at first, since they feared guilt by association. However, as many NPP leaders broke the ice, eventually Romero visited his program and took advantage of the character's popularity. So have most NPP leaders, with the notable exception of Rossell√≥. Eleuterio is very publicly pro-American, but some topics are off-limits in his radio and television appearances, namely 9/11 and specific details about the Iraq War. Eleuterio's son, Elpidio Elpidio Qui√±ones (sometimes referred to by the diminutive, Elpidito) is the son of Eleuterio, and is also played by Logro√±o. Contrary to Eleuterio, Elpidio has a very public profile. He is a special education patient, reportedly 39 years old but with the mental age of an eighth grader, with the sophomoric sense of humor to match. He constantly wears a Superman t-shirt, and has a large overbite (Logro√±o plays the character wearing a dental prosthesis). Elpidio is, therefore, na√Øve enough not to understand the ulterior motives of his classmates. Two of his neighbors are particularly guilty of charging admission to other classmates to show Elpidio naked from the waist down and exhibiting his rather overdeveloped genitalia at school. Elpidio, being an adult, is not carded for purchasing liquor, and is tricked into buying beer and pornography by his mates. Elpidio appears sometimes, either in radio or in television, alongside his mutt, Matruco, a rather affable dog who likes his belly to be scratched (something that inevitably raises Elpidio's curiosity about the dog's penis). At times, Don Eleuterio has been accused of mistreating his son, particularly because he never changes the family diet; since the only decent cooking recipe Eleuterio knows was the one he learned as attendant of a mess hall while in the Army (and since cooking anything more extravagant would be, in his view, effeminate), he feeds his son steamed white rice, mashed potatoes and canned corn every single day (and sometimes for both lunch and dinner). Elpidio is (or was) a regular character in various television series produced by Logro√±o: \\"De Noche Con Sunshine\\", \\"El Condominio\\" and \\"Por el casco de San Juan\\". On these programs, recurring character \\"Do√±a Soto\\" (played by Suzette Bac√≥) claims, after seeing Elpidio naked accidentally a few times, that \\"√âl no es ning√∫n nene n√°\\" (\\"He's no little kid, awright!\\") Eleuterio's love life Don Eleuterio's first wife Virginia, left him for a black American drill sergeant, which is one of his justifications for being racist. This occurred when Elpidio was a little boy; custody was granted to Eleuterio since she fled the Puerto Rican jurisdiction. He then spent years without female company. Eventually, Don Eleuterio befriended a widow, a Cuban pharmacist, named Iris Eduarda, who is also a die-hard pro-statehood supporter (as many exiled Cubans in Puerto Rico are). Although Eleuterio denies it, they seem to have shared intimate moments; more than a few times she has mentioned the fact that Eleuterio uses \\"la pildorita azul\\" (\\"the little blue pill\\"), in reference to Viagra. In recent programs Iris Eduarda has antagonized with listeners, since she is currently demanding that Eleuterio leave his radio program, marry her and move to a post-Fidel Castro Cuba. Her interventions have angered listeners, who constantly advise Eleuterio against marrying her. Eleuterio is yet to decide whether he'll marry her or not. When Miriam Ramirez de Ferrer became a widow, a chance visit to Don Eleuterio's program raised audiences expectations about a possible \\"romance\\" between the two. Ramirez and Logro√±o played the \\"romance\\" for close to three weeks through aired phone conversations. In an NPP fundraising party Ramirez and some followers staged a mock marriage between a costumed actor and Ramirez. Suspecting the situation had gone out of hand, Don Eleuterio claimed that he was \\"framed\\" and that everything was a setup. History The character of Eleuterio Qui√±ones dates from the mid-1980s, when it was part of the lineup for \\"Rompiendo el d√≠a\\" a morning radio show Logro√±o used to host with fellow actor and member of the Puerto Rican political satire collective Los Rayos Gamma, Silverio P√©rez. The radio station's studios were in Guaynabo, and whenever Logro√±o entered the building he would see the landscape attendant, an old man, struggling to pull weeds out. Logro√±o would discuss with P√©rez how he would imagine the attendant's voice, what would his political persuasion be, and so on. Based on him, Logro√±o developed the character for his morning show. The show did not survive, but the character was well received by the show's audience. When Logro√±o started doing his highly controversial television show, \\"Sunshine's Caf√©\\" on WAPA-TV, small sketches featuring actor Jaime Bello interviewing Eleuterio from outside his house were regularly featured in the show. Similar \\"appearances\\" occurred in televised showings of Los Rayos Gamma. With time, Logro√±o was given the chance to do a political satire show on television station WAPA-TV, which was called \\"Politiqueando\\", in 1996. As means to promote the television program, Logro√±o staged short on-air telephone calls to Salsoul, a Puerto Rican radio station. The early evening disc-jockey, Fernando Ar√©valo, would talk to some of the characters of the show, namely a cat puppet of Logro√±o's called Polito Garrapatoso, as well as to Don Eleuterio, for no longer than five minutes. Success from these phone calls was such that audiences demanded a longer treatment. Agitando El Show was then born, giving Eleuterio ten, and later twenty minutes of airtime. Eventually the program grew in length, and Don Eleuterio was given a full hour of airtime daily. The program's name, \\"Agitando\\", means \\"Shaking (people up)\\", as to depict the expected uproar from segments of the audience whenever Don Eleuterio went on the air. Controversy Since Logro√±o is a pro-independence supporter, most statehooders see Eleuterio as an offensive character, and point to Logro√±o as having a covert agenda against the movement. Logro√±o counters by stating that he doesn't have to write a script for his character since, as his occasional mentor Jos√© Miguel Agrelot said constantly, \\"the world is the best scriptwriter\\", and merely observing older statehood supporters in Puerto Rico provides him of enough original material. Logro√±o also claims that some of Eleuterio's criticism against some traditional customs within Puerto Rican culture, such as impunctuality, actually has a positive effect. However, he does concede that the whole concept of Don Eleuterio is that of irony taken to the extreme. Critics such as former PNP (and now independent) senator Orlando Parga, Jr. have debased the character publicly. However, because of the character's durability, most statehooders are by now used to Don Eleuterio's outrageousness, as evidenced by Parga's visit to his radio program in early 2006. Missing in action Eleuterio has a tendency to disappear from the airwaves of his radio program whenever an event negative to the PNP or the pro-statehood cause happens. For example, after the PDPs victory over the PNP in the 2000 general elections, Eleuterio spent three days off the air, while convalescing from an extreme case of diarrhea, induced by his ingestion of whiskey. Calls to the Qui√±ones household were answered by Elpidio, who would try to have his father reach the telephone, to no avail. Cultural relevance=\\"You're Don Eleuterio!\\" Don Eleuterio's views on life and politics in Puerto Rico are so extreme, that the character now serves as a cultural reference. Whenever someone's views within a group of people in Puerto Rico depict him or her as an extremist within the country's pro- statehood movement, or leaning too much to the conservative side of the political spectrum, the subject may find him or herself described as a \\"Don Eleuterio\\" by his peers. Eleuterio, the historian Around the time the 100th anniversary of the invasion of Puerto Rico by American forces during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War was about to be celebrated (or protested, depending on someone's political view) in 1998, NPP Secretary of State (and later senator) Norma Burgos suggested in a newspaper article, that Puerto Ricans such as Julio J. Henna had petitioned United States president William McKinley for an invasion,History of Puerto Rico#Invasion of 1898 Wikipedia's entry on Henna's petition as to relieve Puerto Ricans of Spanish rule. In her article, she wanted to open the debate on whether Henna and other petitioners actually wanted McKinley to annex Puerto Rico to the United States and that, by using that as an excuse, McKinley had consented. In other words, Burgos established the theory of Puerto Rico being \\"invaded by invitation\\" by American troops. According to historical record, the United States had been considering establishing a military base in the Caribbean as early as 1867.See the article on Ram√≥n Emeterio Betances for a reference on the matter. There is some evidence that Puerto Rico (or parts of it) had been considered as a candidate for such a base (through either invasion or purchase) as early as 1891. Historians claim that, even considering Henna's petition as an actual request for invasion, the timing of the letter was merely coincidental to a military event that was probably going to happen anyway, and as such, was arguably not affected by Henna's early request. In fact, a later meeting involving Henna, McKinley, Eugenio Mar√≠a de Hostos, Manuel Zeno Gand√≠a and other Puerto Rican leaders did take place in the White House in Washington, D.C. (on January 19, 1899\\"Puerto Rican Petitions - Commissioners Ask the President for Relief from Grievances\\"), in which they asked for a level of self-government similar or better to the one that had been granted to Puerto Rico just months before the invasion (to which McKinley reportedly refused later). Burgos' article came about in a period when there was considerable debate in Puerto Rico on whether the public school system was being used by then pro-statehood governor Pedro Rossell√≥ as a political indoctrination tool or not. When historians disputed Burgos' claim (which was favorably viewed by Eleuterio) as a distortion of historical fact, Burgos was publicly ridiculed by some. Eleuterio went to the point of \\"editing\\" a newspaper articleThe History of Puerto Rico According to Eleuterio Qui√±ones (first published in Puerto Rico's premiere daily, El Nuevo D√≠a) in which he claimed that Puerto Rican history before 1898 and the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War was almost non-existent, and that the Ta√≠no natives of Puerto Rico were its first drug traffickers. He meant the article to be used as a reference in Puerto Rican schools. Burgos later lamented the incident, claiming that she was primarily a public administrator, and as such, she had better left the subject of historical debate to historians. Guaynabo City The PNP mayor of Guaynabo, H√©ctor O'Neill, bought a few English- language stop signs in 1998, as to save some money (English signs were cheaper than Spanish ones because of economies of scale in the United States). At the suggestion of Rios Gracia 137, one of Guaynabo's Municipal Policemen who was in-charge of the Uniform Crime Reporting Office. Rios took a step further by creating the concept of Guaynabo City in all federal agencies in the United States (who had designed an English-language sign for his police unit), O'Neill had R√≠os' sign design painted and placed in front of the police unit's office. He took the concept further and had a graphic artist redesign a new corporate identity for the city's police department. As he feared it would happen once he approved the proposed designs (O'Neill's candid reaction once he saw the proposed design for the police's patrol cars was reported in San Juan's El Vocero newspaper: \\"This looks gorgeous! Yet, I fear this will be all fucked up once people get to know about this!\\"), he was soon reprimanded by pro-independence citizens of town and Spanish language purists in Puerto Rico for his use of English but was publicly praised by Don Eleuterio, who is also a native. O'Neill then bought several police patrol cars with the English phrase \\"Guaynabo City Police\\" painted on them. As expected, Eleuterio gave his imprimatur to the move. Many Puerto Ricans considered O'Neill's decision as a joke, as irritant as Eleuterio's humor. However, the publicity gave general acceptability to the use of the phrase \\"Guaynabo City\\" to describe the municipality, fueled in part by Don Eleuterio's approving rants. Since Guaynabo is also the city with the largest per capita income in Puerto Rico, it can afford to feature public works that are unique to the country, something that Eleuterio describes as \\"the closest thing in Puerto Rico to Walt Disney World\\", sort of a pro-statehood Valhalla. The term was given international exposure in the Calle 13 song Atr√©vete-te-te, which used it in jest. Ferdinand P√©rez's rise to power Don Eleuterio's radio program, \\"Agitando - El Show\\", was the first (and, for a while, the only) publicity resource PPD legislative candidate Ferdinand P√©rez had to promote himself prior to his 2000 election as member of the Puerto Rico House of Representatives. He participated, along with two other youth leaders (one from each opposition party in Puerto Rico) in a weekly discussion panel hosted by Eleuterio. The program's demographics (mainly young adults) proved to be quite appropriate for P√©rez, since he was elected as an at-large House member by the third largest margin in the 2000 elections, and as a result, was elected House vice-president -an unprecedented feat for a newcomer to Puerto Rican politics. P√©rez has credited \\"Agitando\\" (and particularly Don Eleuterio) as directly responsible for his acquired popularity. Eleuterio's radio program=Format Don Eleuterio is featured every weekday in Agitando El Show, which airs at 5:00 PM, AST. The program is hosted by Ar√©valo and Logro√±o (and recently, by Aim√©e Cora, the station's marketing executive, who happens to be the sister of MLB baseball players Joey Cora and Alex Cora). One of the station's sales executives, whose last name is Belgodere, joins the casts occasionally; his purpose is to balance Don Eleuterio's comments, given Belgodere's affiliation to the opposition party, the Popular Democratic Party of Puerto Rico. Normally, the program starts by having Cora and Ar√©valo read the headlines of current news items. Don Eleuterio then joins in through the telephone (Logro√±o claims that the limited bandwidth of the phone call is actually preferred by the audience, rather than impersonating the character in the studio from behind a microphone). In the past, he usually started his intervention with a speech, complete with cathedral-like echo and a background rendition of \\"The Star Spangled Banner\\" or \\"America The Beautiful\\". This only happens occasionally in recent airings of the program. Eleuterio then comments the news items, along with Ar√©valo (and sometimes Belgodere or Cora). The commentary is usually punctuated by soundbites from previous visits by politicians to the program. These soundbites are guaranteed to be humorous or unflattering, as to elicit a comic effect. Two memorable ones are one by former governoress of Puerto Rico, Sila Calder√≥n: \\"Mentira... ¬°Mentira! Eso es una mentira, grande, as√≠, como de √©ste tama√±o...\\" (\\"Lie... A lie! That's a big lie, about this big!\\"), and another from current Senate of Puerto Rico president Kenneth McClintock: \\"¬øY qu√© carajo te importa?\\" (\\"And why the fuck should you care?\\"). Depending on the general mood of the program, he might open the phone lines for comments. Pro-statehood supporters usually ask him for his blessing, and some go to the extreme of calling him \\"Grandpa\\", in English. Non-statehood supporters are guaranteed to be scorned or ridiculed by Eleuterio. Special Sections If a news item proves to be controversial, Eleuterio breaks into an impromptu \\"Encuesta Rel√°mpago\\" (\\"Flash Poll\\"), where people vote on two sides of an issue. Eleuterio only intervenes at the end of the poll. In the beginning, Eleuterio used to host \\"La Tribuna\\" (\\"The Podium\\"), a discussion panel that involves three youth leaders, one from each major political party in Puerto Rico. They are, of course, exposed to Eleuterio's questioning and ranting. This segment was canceled later on. Occasionally, Don Eleuterio receives emails and letters from people who praise a particular situation that they have experienced while visiting or living in the United States. An example of this may be: a Puerto Rican that recently moved to Seattle, Washington, bought a new refrigerator, is told by the salesperson at the store that the appliance would be delivered at precisely 10:00 AM (and not within an imprecise time or date range, as Eleuterio claims the norm is in Puerto Rico), and is delivered exactly at 9:59 AM. Eleuterio stages comments to these letters within a section called \\"El Otro Mundo\\" (\\"The Other World\\"), implying that the positive characteristic praised in it belongs somewhere too far removed from Puerto Rico from ever happening in the country. Usually, the music theme for The X-Files is played in the background while the section runs. Don Eleuterio's intervention usually takes over the first hour of the show. The remaining half hour is usually reserved for Logro√±o's other comedic characters, Vit√≠n Alicea (a clever closet homosexual who is a fan of wrestling), Chemba Osorio (a feminist who, at age 40, is unmarried by choice), or El Barbarazo del Amor (a sexual pervert turned into a media sexologist).

Having marked Mastandrea's directorial debut, the film features two brothers and their friends who travel to an island cabin the brothers inherited from their recently deceased uncle for a relaxing weekend getaway. However, the group is besieged by ravenous genetically enhanced dogs bred to kill via an abandoned training facility on the island. It was released in May at the Cannes Film Festival and subsequently released in other film markets and festivals around the world. Plot The movie begins with a couple on a small sailboat who find a small island and begin to look around. The woman wanders off while the man ties up the boat. She stumbles across a fence and a small compound, but no one seems to be around. She is then attacked by unknown creatures. The man at the boat is startled by her screams. Sometime later, a seaplane heads to what appears to be the same island. Matt (Lively) and John (Hudson) are two brothers who are heading to the island for a week of fun and relaxation. The island was owned by their uncle, who built a cabin on it. He recently died, and the island is otherwise uninhabited. The brothers are joined by three friends, Nicki (Rodriguez), Sara (Manning) and Noah (Harper). Upon landing, they moor the seaplane at a dock near the cabin. Soon after they arrive, a puppy shows up. The friends take him in to the cabin. Noah goes into the kitchen to get a drink. The puppy follows him in. The puppy then mysteriously growls at him and runs off. Sara and John then follow him out. They are ambushed by an older vicious dog and Sara is bitten by it. The pair manage to get back to the cabin. The following morning, the men are in the forest. They bump into the man who came to the island at the beginning of the movie. He is bloody and warns them about the dogs. A pack of dogs attack and eat him. The men run back to the cabin and tell the women to come inside. A dog attacks Nicki and John shoots an arrow to save her, wanting to kill a dog, but accidentally impales one through of Nicki's shin instead. They are soon under siege by more vicious dogs, one of which they impale with a hot-poker. The friends decide they must leave the island, but dogs have surrounded the plane. As they have no other way off the island, and no means of communication, they will have to wait out the dogs. However, a few minutes later, they see the plane has detached from its moorings and is drifting toward the ocean; the dogs have chewed through the ropes to force the friends out of the cabin. When John attempts to swim to the plane, the dogs are on the plane and they attack him. However, he manages to swim to the dock, then the friends retreat to the house. Sara begins to show distinct canine behavior, such as a ravenous appetite and growling. Their next idea is to make their way to a storage shed and drive their uncle's car to the training compound, where they believe they can call for help. However, the car won't start and that night, with no other options, they continue to party. The power goes out, and Noah heads to the fuse box in the basement which also contains a stock of vintage wine, where he is killed by dogs who have managed to enter the house. The dogs then find their way into the rest of the cabin, and Matt is bitten. John, Matt, Nicki, and Sara have to hide in the attic. There, they discover paperwork relating to the training facility, and learn it was an Army facility to train attack dogs. The next morning, the dogs have left. Matt and John make another attempt and manage to pop the clutch of their uncle's Mercedes Benz. They go back to pick up the women, but Sara does not want to leave. The dogs attack her again, and in fighting one, Sara falls out of the window and impales herself and the dog on a post. Matt, John, and Nicki drive to the facility and find it abandoned. They break in and discover that the dogs were being genetically enhanced. John finds communications equipment, but a power cable on the antenna has been disconnected, so he goes out to fix it. Having been bitten and infected, Matt learns he can sense the dogs, and realizes if they escaped they can get back in. When the antenna is powered up, John is accidentally shocked by electricity, and when he falls to the ground the dogs attack him. Matt shows up with a baseball bat to fight off the dogs, but a power surge has caused a fire in the compound. Nicki realizes the fire is creating a backdraft, and lures in the dogs before exposing them to the fire. The building then explodes, killing all the dogs inside. John tells Matt that he saw a nearby boat, which was owned by the couple from beginning of the film. When the dogs surround the brothers, the dogs do not appear hostile and almost look accepting. Before anything can happen, Nicki shows up in the Mercedes, the brothers jump in and drive off. Because there are so many dogs, they cannot stop the car and get out, so John has Nicki drive the car off the pier. They swim to the boat and sail off. Thinking they are safe, they wonder if they can make it to medical facilities before Matt and John fall victim to the dog bites and become feral-minded like the dogs. In the last shot, they open the door to the sleeping quarters, and a stowaway dog leaps out.

In Chinese yi means \\"change\\", jin means \\"tendons and sinews\\", while jing means \\"methods\\". While some consider these exercises as a form of Qigong, it is a relatively intense form of exercise that aims at strengthening the muscles and tendons, so promoting strength and flexibility, speed and stamina, balance and coordination of the body. In the modern day, there are many translations and distinct sets of exercises all said to be derived from the original (the provenance of which is the subject of some debate). These exercises are notable for being a key element of the physical conditioning used in Shaolin training. Origins According to legend, the Yijin Jing was said to be left behind by Bodhidharma after his departure from the Shaolin Monastery, and discovered within his grave (or hidden in the walls of the temple) years after he had left (or died). It was accompanied by another text, the Xisui Jing, which was passed to a student of Bodhidharma's, but has not survived to the modern day. The monks of Shaolin supposedly practiced the exercises within the text but lost the true purpose of the document; Lin Boyuan recounts the legend that they \\"selfishly coveted it, practicing the skills therein, falling into heterodox ways, and losing the correct purpose of cultivating the Way. The Shaolin monks have made some fame for themselves through their fighting skill; this is all due to having obtained this manuscript.\\" Both documents were written, per the mythology, in an Indian language which was not well understood by the monks of the temple. According to one legend, a monk decided that the text must contain more valuable knowledge than simply self-defense, and went on a pilgrimage with a copy of the text to find someone who could translate the deeper meaning of the text. He eventually met an Indian priest named Pramati in the province of Szechwan who, examining the text, explained that the meaning of the text was extraordinarily deep and beyond his ability to translate fully. He nonetheless provided a partial translation. The monk found that within a year of practicing the techniques as Pramati had translated, that his constitution had become \\"as hard as steel,\\" and he felt that he could be a Buddha. The monk was so pleased that he thereafter followed Pramati wherever he went. Modern Scholarly Research The legendary account springs from two prefaces which accompany the Yijin Jing. One of these prefaces purports to be written by the general Li Jing in 628 during the Tang Dynasty, while the other purports to be written by the general Niu Gao, an officer of the Song Dynasty General Yue Fei. However, there are several inaccuracies and inconsistencies in these forewords that cast doubt on the authenticity of Bodhidharma's authorship of the Yijin Jing. It was specifically the foreword by Li Jing by which Tang Hao traced the attribution of Shaolin Kung Fu to Bodhidharma. Li Jing's foreword refers to \\"the tenth year of the Taihe period of Emperor Xiaoming of Northern Wei.\\"Lin 1996:182‚Äì183 The Taihe reign period did not occur under Emperor Xiaoming but under Emperor Xiaowen and, in its tenth year (487 CE), the Shaolin temple did not yet exist according to the Jiaqing Chongxiu Yitongzhi, itself an updated compilation of earlier records, which states that the Shaolin temple was built in the twentieth year of the Taihe era (497 CE).Jiaqing chongxiu yitongzhi ÂòâÊÖ∂Èáç‰øÆ‰∏ÄÁµ±Âøó. The Ricci Institute Library Online Catalog. Li Jing's foreword also claims that he received the manual containing the exercises from the \\"Bushy Bearded Hero\\" (Ëô¨È´ØÂÆ¢, Qiuran ke), a popular fictional character from a Tang Dynasty story of the same name by Du Guangting (850-933).For a brief synopsis of this character's tale, see Liu, James J.Y. The Chinese Knight Errant. London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1967 (), pp. 87-88 Niu Gao's foreword mentions the Qinzhong temple, which wasn't erected until 20 years after the date he claims to be writing. He also claims to be illiterate. Dictation could resolve the question of how an illiterate could write a foreword, but it is almost certain that a general of Niu Gao's stature was not illiterate. Thus during the 18th century, the scholar Ling Tingkan concluded in a sarcastic fashion that the author of the Yijin Jing must have been an \\"ignorant\\" and a \\"master\\" all at the same time (i.e., Tingkan states that the author must have been an \\"ignorant village master\\"). The text of the Yijin Jing was probably composed by the Taoist priest Zining writing in 1624.Lin 1996:183 The earliest surviving edition of the Yijin Jing was dated by Ryuchi Matsuda to 1827. In the course of his research, Matsuda found no mention of‚Äîlet alone attribution to‚ÄîBodhidharma in any of the numerous texts written about the Shaolin martial artsSuch as Cheng Zongyou's Explanation of the Original Shaolin Staff Method or Zhang Kongzhao's Boxing Classic: Essential Boxing Methods. before the 19th century. Yijin Jing ‚Äì The Forms Picture on the wall at Shaolin Monastery The number of exercises tends to change; some contend that 18 should be the correct one (if based on the 18 Arhats), but can vary from 10 to 24, to 30. Today the most respected routine is that of Wang Zuyuan, composed of 12 exercises, and has been adopted by the Academies of Chinese Medicine in China. Chang Renxia together with Chang Weizhen proposed an alternative set of 14 exercises, which can be of interest for the therapeutic effects he promises. Deng Mingdao presents a version with 24 exercises, but with another name, Xisui Jing. In fact, another point of contention is the relationship between the Xisui Jing and the Yijin Jing. Some authors tend to use those two names for the same routine; others keep things separated and invoke different results and different effects on the body. Then, there are other authors that have written different books and created different theories, sometimes not simply in search for the truth. The 12 Posture Moving Exercise kept to this day is something that Wang Zuyuan learned at the Shaolin Monastery on Mount Song. It is somewhat different from the original \\"Picture of stationary exercise\\" and the \\"Guide to the art of attack\\" (as Guangdong sources demonstrate). Some specialists (Liu Dong) refer to a later integration of Yijin Jing, Daoyin, Tu-na and Xingyi methods. However Wang's 12 Postures is found through practice to be a concise aid in enhancing one's physical health. As the name implies, \\"sinew transforming exercise\\" is the method to train the tendons and muscles. The exercise is designed according to the course and characteristics of Qi circulation in the 12 regular channels and the Du and Ren channels. During practice, Qi and blood usually circulates with proper speed and with no sluggishness or stagnation. Because of such efficacy, Yijin Jing has existed for centuries as a favorite with the populace and is still widely used in sanatoria and hospitals for therapeutic purposes. Two ancient written and illustrated routines remain, one from Chen Yi's \\"A Collection of Annals\\" published during the Ming Dynasty and another more recent one published in 1882 from Wang Zuyuan's \\"Internal Work Illustrated\\". The 12 Posture Moving Exercise supposedly describes what is called the purported \\"12 fists of Bodhidharma\\" in many Southern martial arts, most notably Hung Gar and Wing chun. Legend states that the 12 exercises were developed based on the movements of the 12 animals that Bodhidharma studied after his 9 years of meditation. These exercises aided the health of the Shaolin Monastery monks, and contributed to many of the animal-based martial arts in China. Purposes of Yijin Jing The basic purpose of Yijin Jing is to turn flaccid and frail sinews and tendons into strong and sturdy ones. The movements of Yijin Jing are at once vigorous and gentle. Their performance calls for a unity of will and strength, i.e. using one's will to direct the exertion of muscular strength. It is coordinated with breathing. Better muscles and tendons means better health and shape, more resistance, flexibility, and endurance. It is obtained as follows: *postures influence the static and nervous structure of the body *stretching muscles and sinews affects organs, joints, meridians and Qi *torsion affects metabolism and Jing production *breathing produces more and better refined Qi *active working gives back balance and strength to body and mind (brain, nervous system and spirit). Power and endurance are of paramount importance if we look at becoming qualified in whatever practice we choose, be it Tui na, martial arts, or simply better health and wisdom. Already another known Qigong system, Baduanjin, in its more radical and strong forms was used in the past from schools of Xingyiquan and Taijiquan as bodily preparation to fighting arts, in order to make body strong and flexible. Baduanjin still remains the first, entry-level routine to learn at Shaolin training schools in Song Mountains. We can still see today Japanese Kata like Sanchin, postures and forms like Siunimtao in Wingchung, \\"Iron thread\\" in Hung Gar and all sorts of Neigong in Neijia. Martial artists need to be powerful in the martial practice, like non- martial people need to be healthy. But there is also something supple and flexible inside of Yijin Jing. Movements are energetic and intense, but you can see through a kind of peace. Yijin Jing unifies in fact Yi (intention) with Li (strength), consciousness (yang) with muscular force (yin). The mind is free from thoughts, has a correct and well-disposed attitude, the breathing is harmonious. Internal and external movement must be coordinated, like movement with relaxation. Externally must be fortification; inside must be purification; unifying matter and spirit. Some classic recurring points of Yijin Jing can be described as follows: *Most of the movements use open palms, fists are used only for stretching the tendons. *The names of exercises change, but often the basic idea of movement remains the same. I.e. Wei Tuo greets and offers something (Nanjing Ac. of Tuina); Wei Tuo offers gifts to the sky (Liu Dong); General Skanda holds the Cudgel (Zong Wu-Li Mao). *Movements are done standing, sometimes bending forward, but never lying or sitting. *Eyes are always open, never closed. *Movements are slow but full and tensed, face and body shows relaxed attitude. *All directions of the upper body section (especially shoulders) are active and moved. *Dynamic tension rules the moves. *All parts of the body work together. *There are different ways of practicing the same Yijin Jing form, according to the basic rules, to the body shape, to the time of practice and to the general health conditions. According to traditional verbal formulas, we have that: *The first year of training gives back physical and mental vitality. *The second year enhances blood circulation and nurtures meridians. *The third year allows flexibility to muscles and nurtures the organs. *The fourth year improves meridians and nurtures viscera. *The fifth year washes the marrow and nurtures the brain. The Five rules of Yijin Jing are: ;Quietness :Like lake water reflects the moon, a calm spirit allows energy to move inside the body. ;Slowness :In order to use and flex muscles deeply, to get maximum extension and move Qi and Xue, slow movements are required. ;Extension :Each movement must be brought to the maximum. ;Pause :Efficacy comes through waiting and keeping tension for a longer time. ;Flexibility :Limbs and trunk must be extended so that blood and energy can circulate, so we have flexibility. Breathing in Yijin Jing is a controversial point. Many modern sources insist on a deep, forced, reverse breathing in order to develop power and more thoroughly energize the body. Other sources suggest that this may often create excessive strain and pressure on the body. Robert W. Smith, in his article on the J.A.M.A. in 1996, suggests that there are differences between the northern and the southern way of breath. The southern variants seem not to have a developed system of regulating breathing or working on Qi. In his work on \\"Breathing in Taiji and other fighting arts\\", Smith analyses not only Taiji veterans and classics, but also known fighters out of his personal experience, and concludes that the kind of breathing which is most effective, be it for martial or for health purposes, is located between classic abdominal breathing and a slow, unconscious breathing, with scope for explosive exhalations of the kind typically used to accompany strikes in many martial arts styles. Popular culture The Yijin Jing is featured in Louis Cha's wuxia novel The Smiling, Proud Wanderer. In the story, the Shaolin abbot teaches Linghu Chong (the protagonist) how to use the skills described in the Yijin Jing to heal his internal injuries. In the manhua \\"Dragon Tiger Gate\\", Shibumi (\\"Evil God of the Fiery Cloud\\"), the supreme ruler of the Lousha Sect in Japan, has mastered this legendary Qi technique. In the graphic novel, Yijin Jing is divided into 7 stages, or 7 \\"levels of the pagoda\\". Besides the 1st and 2nd stage without a color, the last stages all have distinctive colors associated with them: 3rd = red, 4th = yellow, 5th = blue, 6th = white and finally 7th = black. \\"The Black Pagoda\\" therefore is the most powerful and most dangerous of all. One who masters this stage is virtually unbeatable.

Intervention theory addresses the question of when it is desirable not to intervene and when it is appropriate to do so. It also examines the effectiveness of different types of intervention. The term is used across a range of social and medical practices, including health care, child protection and law enforcement. It is also used in business studies. Within the theory of nursing, intervention theory is included within a larger scope of practice theories. Burns and Grove point out that it directs the implementation of a specific nursing intervention and provides theoretical explanations of how and why the intervention is effective in addressing a particular patient care problem. These theories are tested through programs of research to validate the effectiveness of the intervention in addressing the problem.Burns and Grove, Understanding Nursing Research, 2007, pp 281-3. In Intervention Theory and Method Chris Argyris argues that in organization development, effective intervention depends on appropriate and useful knowledge that offers a range of clearly defined choices and that the target should be for as many people as possible to be committed to the option chosen and to feel responsibility for it. Overall, interventions should generate a situation in which actors believe that they are working to internal rather than external influences on decisions.Chris Argyris, Intervention Theory and Method: A Behavioral Science View (Addison-Wesley series in social science and administration), Addison-Wesley, 1970 See also * Cognitive interventions, a set of techniques and therapies practiced in counseling * Psychological intervention, any action by psychological professionals designed to bring about change in a client * Health intervention, an effort to promote good health behaviour or to prevent bad health behaviour * Human Systems Intervention, the design and implementation of interventions in social settings where adults are confronted with the need to change their perspectives, attitudes, and actions * Intervention (counseling), an attempt to compel a subject to \\"get help\\" for an addiction or other problem * Policy, administrative principles guiding organizational behavior to achieve rational goals Notes Decision theory ","title":"Intervention theory"},{"id":"6355334","text":"Emmanouil Pappas () is a municipality in the Serres regional unit, Greece.

It is located on Bayshore Drive, west of U.S. 19, a mile south of I-275. On August 12, 1970, it was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. It is also a Florida State Park. The site was the first Native American location in Florida to be designated as a State Archaeological Site. History Archaeological excavations have established that indigenous occupation reaches back 2,000 years, and across three distinct periods: Manasota, Weedon Island, and Safety Harbor cultures. The people constructed a massive earthwork temple/ceremonial mound from shells, sand and detritus. It is still high, with a base nearly 100 by . Scholars believe that the mound site continued to be of great ceremonial importance to the historic Tocobaga Indians of the surrounding area, who coalesced as a people before European encounter in the late sixteenth century. They survived into the eighteenth century, but disappeared as a tribe due to infectious diseases and warfare. The site is named for Madira Bickel of Sarasota. She and her husband, Karl, purchased the land around the main mound and donated it to the state in 1948. The mounds The point of greatest interest at the site is the high temple/ceremonial mound. Composed of shells (obtained from a midden to the west), sand, and detritus, the mound's base is by . To more easily reach the top, the Tocobaga constructed a curved wide ramp on the western side. The state park has graduated stairways for access, and at the top, has cleared an area (protected by a fence) for overlooking the park. Over the centuries, the mound has become covered with vegetation, including tall trees. Also in the park are the remains of the Prine Burial Mound, which is circular, about wide, and about high at the center. It was used through the three major archaeological cultures described above, from 800-1500 AD. Since settlement and development, much of the mound's contents have been disturbed.

Swedish goggles are relatively low cost, with basic goggles costing around $5 retail and metallic goggle costing around $15. Much of the popularity of Swedish goggles is due to their customizable fit. The goggles are sold unassembled, with each goggle set including a pair of eye cups, one long (around 36\\") latex rubber strip, and a nose piece consisting of string that fits inside a plastic or rubber tube. Swimmers may choose a single or double head strap, and some choose to cut a small piece of latex from the head strap for use as a nose piece. Malmsten's official assembly instructions can be found here. Assembly Swedish goggles require complete user assembly, which results in a fit that is specifically tailored to their owner. Proper assembly generally requires some skill and practice, as well as precision. Before assembly, the inside edges of the lenses are often filed down to remove any sharp edges and thus improve comfort. The first step in building a set of Swedish goggles is to construct a nose piece. Nose pieces can feature a variety of designs, some of the most popular are the included string threaded through the included rubber tube, a short length of the included strap (which is much more easily adjusted than the string), or simply using the string as a nose piece. For nose pieces using the string and tube, a pair of tweezers can be used to guide the string through the small holes located on the inside of the frames, as well as into the rubber tube. A small knot is then tied by hand and threaded into the tube. Next, the latex strap is guided through the outboard holes of the goggle frames. The loose ends of the straps may be cut off if the user wishes to have a one-strap setup. Otherwise, they may be tied off, creating a two-strap setup and completing goggle assembly.

All four books, published between 1997, 1998, 2002 and 2007, are commonly assigned in the curriculum of upper elementary and middle school grades in Canada, and in some parts of the United States. Summary=Prologue: The Great War The great war between the birds and the beasts happened approximately 65 million years after the extinction of the dinosaurs for dominance over the land and sky. The bats, however, seeing themselves as neither birds nor beasts, remained neutral throughout the conflict. Finally a compromise was reached; the birds would control the sky, while the beasts would claim the land. However, because the bats refused to take sides, they were banished from being allowed to fly during the day‚Äînot even allowed to so much as look at the sun‚Äîever again; only emerging at night. The war is based on Aesop's Fables called \\"The Birds, the Beasts and the Bat.\\"  Sun Freedom (Silverwing and Sunwing)  As Shade Silverwing looks at the sun, the owls destroy Tree Haven. While the Silverwing bats are migrating to Hibernaculum, he gets swept to sea. After Shade meets Marina Brightwing on an island, they head to the city. They encounter many other characters such as Zephyr, a bat who can see through the past and future, the cannibals Goth and Throbb, the rat kings Romulus and Remus, and humans who attempt to capture or kill them. Shade stays with Marina and finds his colony at Hibernaculum. After hibernating for two days, some members of the colony go on a journey to find Cassiel, who disappeared after finding the truth about the humans. When they find a building called \\"paradise\\" with bats living in it, the colony finds out that Cassiel is absent. While the other bats make themselves at home, Shade and Marina escape. After being separated, Shade ends up in the jungle, teams up with Orestes and finds out that sacrifices were being made at the Vampyrum Spectrum pyramid in order to banish the sun, and that Cassiel will also be a sacrifice . After Shade and Marina free the bats, owls and rats in order to defeat Goth, the owls permit the bats to look at the sun, while Marina and Shade become mates.  Underworld (Firewing)  Years later while Shade returns to Tree Haven for the first time, his son Griffin falls to the underground after accidentally dropping a fiery stick on his friend Luna. Finding out that dead bats live here forgetting that they died, he finds multiple bats with a strange glow. In the underworld, Cama Zotz orders the revived Goth to hunt down Griffin. After Frieda gives the sound map to Griffin, he and Luna attempt to escape from the underworld, and are helped by other dead bats that know each other. Goth kills Griffin, but Shade gives up his life for Griffin and Luna, who return to the upper world. Main characters *Shade: A silver-haired bat who is teased about his lack of size and strength. He learns about Cassiel from the colony. He is na√Øve to the dangerous world around him, where owls rule the skies and he dares look at the sun - which in their world is forbidden - without much idea about the consequences. This starts off a chain of events, which test both his loyalty and strength to the fellow bats. He is the main protagonist of the series who saves his colony more than once and slowly rises in the ranks to become the respected Silverwing he always wanted to be. In 'Firewing', he is a father and appears briefly in the main plot. *Marina Brightwing: An Eastern red bat and Shade's closest friend who is one year older than him. After being banded, she was banished from her colony and went to live on an island. In Silverwing after meeting Shade at the island, she escorts him to reunite with his colony. Goth tore off Marina's band. In Sunwing, Shade and Marina become mates. In Firewing, Marina's role is much more minor compared to the other two books in the series; she briefly appears in the beginning and is only mentioned in the ending. This was probably to give Griffin, their son, more character growth and development. *Goth: A cannibal bat and prince of the Vampyrum spectrum who is deceptive and cunning. He and Throbb were taken from South America to the city. His carnivorous nature makes him eat many kinds of animals, including birds, turning the owls against bats. In the first book, Goth and Throbb are captured by scientists. They escape, meet Shade and Marina, and plot to follow them to Hibernaculum, where they could kill the entire colony. In the end, Goth is injured by lightning. The demon-god Cama Zotz heals Goth and makes him King of the Vampyrum Spectrum, but Goth was killed when the high priest Voxzaco dropped a powerful explosive device on the temple in an attempt to sacrifice everyone to resurrect Cama Zotz in the Underworld. In Firewing, he attempts to take Griffin's life as his own and give Shade's life to Zotz. However, he failed, but was reborn and went to the Upperworld to restart Zotz's worship. *Griffin: Shade and Marina's son, and a Silverwing and Brightwing hybrid.He is notable for being a worrywart and having a way with words. At the end of Firewing he feels he has become a hero like Shade. Griffin and Luna are nearly killed by Goth, but Shade gives his life for the two so that they could return home to the upper world. *Luna: A female Silverwing newborn and Griffin's best friend. While the other Silverwing newborns see Griffin as boring and somewhat annoying, she sees his neurotic and worry-wart antics as amusing. Luna created \\"the Owl Game\\", which involves landing as close to an owl as possible, which Griffin dislikes. Later, Luna, Griffin and a few Silverwing newborns see and investigate a fire in the forest. They discover humans near the campfire, and Griffin steals some fire from the humans, but accidentally drops it on Luna, who suffers fatal burns as a result. Secondary characters=Silverwings The Northern Bats have an Elder hierarchy, with one being elected high elder. Silverwings are based on the Silver-Haired Bat. *Ariel: Shade's mother who raises Shade after Cassiel left. At the end of Sunwing, she is elected elder. *Cassiel: Shade's father, who left the colony . Shade finds him in the abandoned Mayan temple being used by the Vampyrum Spectrum for sacrifices. *Mercury: A male; the only one who stays with the females and their young outside of winter. He acts as a messenger amongst the Silverwings, befitting his namesake. *Chinook: Shade's best friend. At the end of Sunwing he and Shade become friends and brothers because his parents died and he was adopted by Ariel and Cassiel at Shade's request (though Shade kept this a secret from Chinook, believing his once- rival would never let him hear the end of it). Chinook is frequently scared, like his step-nephew Griffin, but is brave when he needs to be, and he has good survival instincts. He was once very fond of dumping snow on Shade's head, though this may have just been an attempt to gain attention from Shade and Marina. *Plato and Isis: Chinook's parents who travel with the other Silverwings to the human building at the beginning of Sunwing. They perished in the firestorm in the jungle. *Jarod, Osric, Yara, Rasha and Penumbra: Newborns; friends and admirers of Chinook. *Frieda: An elder of the Silverwing colony who is banded. She is the oldest bat in the colony, thus the wisest and helps Shade, even though he did something foolish. At the end of Sunwing, she dies at Bridge City. In the Underworld, she meets Griffin, telling him where to find the tree of life, a possible means of escape for him. She commends Griffin's desire to take Luna with him despite the fact that he knows she may slow him down. *Bathsheba: A selfish elder of the colony, who scolds Shade for breaking the law and mistrusts the animals. In the television series, Bathsheba betrays them. *Lucretia: One of the female elders who becomes a chief elder in Firewing. *Aurora: One of the female elders. *Icarus: A male; he is optimistic about what the bands foretell. *Ishmael: A Silverwing captured by the Vampyrum for the ritual. He escaped, but his brother and others did not. While helping rescue Chinook and the other captives, Ishmael knocked his brother off of the Stone and was killed seconds later by Voxzaco on the sacrificial stone. Vampyrum Spectrum The Vampyrum Spectrum has a monarchy. They are carnivores and eat just about anything smaller than them, including other bats. They worship the Mayan bat god Cama Zotz. Vampyrum spectrum is the Latin name of the Spectral Bat. *Throbb: Goth's fellow prisoner in the first book, who lacks courage and is forced to do his bidding. He is killed by a thunderstorm. His ghost serves Cama Zotz in the Underworld by aiding in an attempt to tunnel through to the world of the living. *Voxzaco: A High Priest talking to Cama Zotz by eating strange, possibly hallucinogenic, herbs (shrooms). His spine is crooked due to age. He is able to interpret the stone calendar that serves religious purposes. He commits suicide by dropping a bomb that destroys the temple in an attempt to sacrifice 100 hearts to Zotz. In the third book, Zotz reveals that his ghost is suffering eternal torment in his stomach for his failure. While alive, he tried to remove the heart of Ishmael's brother, but Ishmael sacrificed his life for his brother, allowing Voxzaco to devour him. *Phoenix: Zotz's female servant, whose name is derived from the phoenix, a legendary bird who rejuvenates itself through an immersion in fire. Phoenix fails to restore it with Goth, after Shade gives life for Griffin. She was to become Goth's mate when she was restored to life, but it is unknown when she will be able to do so, as it is not common for creatures to be sucked into the Underworld. *Murk: A rare benevolent Vampyrum traveling to the Tree with Shade, Yorick, Nemo and Java. Other bats *Zephyr: An albino bat who lives in a church spire, a central hub for migrating bat colonies. He is very old and has lost his ability to see, but he uses his sonar with great accuracy. He also can see into the past and future using his ears. He has a vast knowledge of medicinal herbs. *Scirocco: A long-eared bat that led a movement among the banded bats, saying they were promised to become humans. It is unknown what happened to him, or whether he was killed by Goth and Throbb. *Penelope: A banded Brightwing who was originally part of Marina's colony. Like Marina, she was exiled from the colony for having a band. She later became one of those who followed Scirocco. She and her colony are devoured by Goth and Throbb. *Caliban: A mastiff bat who leads a survival group living in Statue Haven. The group consisted of bats used by humans to carry fire (bombs) and were led by Shade's father until he was captured by the Vampyrum Spectrum. Statue Haven was based within the statue of Christ the Redeemer above Rio de Janeiro. Dead bats in Zotz's kingdom *Yorick: A 500-year-old Silverwing bat who always wants the way, because he has the map to the Tree. He lethally crashed into a tree, which severely damaged his wing and he has to suffer the pain. *Nemo: A fish eater living in the coastal waters way down south. He has been dead for roughly 48 years. His death was caused by being eaten. *Java: A foxwing with a wingspan of five feet, though she is a runt like Shade and even bigger than Goth. She becomes innocent toward any living thing. She does not have the gift of echolocation, which Shade does not like, but has excellent eyesight. She became lost after setting out for the Tree, having forgotten the verbal instructions the Pilgrims gave her, when Yorick found her way off course and invited her to travel with him. Unlike her two companions, she lived a full life and died of old age. Other animals *King Boreal: The king of the owls who appears only in Sunwing. When he goes to attack Bridge City, although he is persuaded otherwise by his son, Orestes. He is also persuaded to lift the flying ban on the bats, free the imprisoned bats at the various Hibernaculums and to also give the bats the freedom to fly in the daylight if they so choose. *Brutus: An owl general who led the owls burning Tree Haven, after Shade glimpsed the sun. He dislikes bats and fought in the war to retrieve the Sun, although he wanted his species to keep control of the daylight skies and the owls won. *Orestes: A young owl prince; son of King Boreal. One of those who persuaded the owls to lift their ban on the presence of bats in daylight. He was saved by Shade from humans. In the TV adaptation, he is Brutus's son. *Romulus: King of the Northern rats who is considered a freak because of winglike flaps of skin between his fore and hind legs, which for his part led him to believe that bats and rats have a common ancestor. When his brother Prince Remus fled, he took command. *Remus: Prince of the Northern rats. He is distrustful of everyone, to the point of paranoia. He scares himself into abdication from the throne, believing a plot to poison him was afoot. *General Cortez: King of the southern rats, who appears only in Sunwing, where his youngest son is captured by Vampyrum. He and Shade stop Goth from resurrecting Zotz, and save Cassiel, Ariel, Chinook and Cortez's son. He also helps Marina save Shade. He is named after the conquistador Hernando Cortez who conquered the Aztec Empire. Locations *Tree Haven: An oak tree where young bats are raised during the spring and summer. In Silverwing, the owls burned it down. After the new one is chosen, the females and newborns start living there at the end of Sunwing. *Stone Hold: A place where the male bats roost during the spring and summer. *Spire: The tower of a cathedral, which is a landmark in some colonies sound maps for migrating. Shade's colony came to this Spire; this is also where Shade and Marina meet Zephyr the Keeper of the Spire. *Hibernaculum: A place behind a waterfall where Shade's colony goes to hibernate during the winter. *Human Building: A bat paradise with no predators and plenty of insects, where it is always summer and they can see the sun. However, it is a place where humans take bats (northern and southern) and owls to attach explosives to them and send them south to bomb enemies. *Jungle: A rainforest, most likely in Central America. Home to the Vampyrum spectrum bats and the Pyramid. It also hosts creatures such as large insects, southern owls and other exotic things that northern bats haven't seen. *Statue Haven: A statue of Jesus Christ facing Rio de Janeiro. The survivors of the explosions from the metal disks use it as a safe haven from the Vampyrum. *The Pyramid: Home to the royal order of Vampyrum. It is filled with millions of bats. It was destroyed when Voxzaco dropped an explosive on it, killing them. Shade's family and friends escaped, although many bats‚Äîincluding the others‚Äîdid not. *Underworld: A place created by Cama Zotz for his Vampyrum spectrum. It is beneath the earth and is mostly made up of pictures that occur in bats' minds as a result of conflicting sonal vibration, giving the appearance of images. All bats that die end up there. It is possible, but rare, for a living thing to enter the Underworld, where the denizens will notice a \\"glow\\" about them; this \\"glow\\" is the creature's life force, and it can be stolen from them. At the place where Zotz fought and killed his counterpart Nocturna, a great Tree made seemingly of fire grows. Entering it, the bats become as Nocturna has become; an observing intelligence in the natural world.

One major element of the Cold War was the threat of a nuclear war; another was espionage. Many works use the Cold War as a backdrop, or directly take part in fictional conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union. The period 1953‚Äì62 saw Cold War themes first enter the mainstream culture as a public preoccupation. For the historical context in the US, see United States in the 1950s. Fiction: spy stories Cloak and dagger stories became part of the popular culture of the Cold War in both East and West, with innumerable novels and movies that showed how polarized and dangerous the world was.Katy Fletcher, \\"Evolution of the Modern American Spy Novel.\\" Journal of Contemporary History 1987 22(2): 319-331. in Jstor Soviet audiences thrilled at spy stories showing how their KGB agents protected the motherland by foiling dirty work by the United States' nefarious Central Intelligenge Agency, Britain's devious MI6, and Israel's devilish Mossad. After 1963, Hollywood increasingly depicted the CIA as clowns (as in the comedy TV series Get Smart) or villains (as in Oliver Stone's 1992 film JFK).

The logic of this was that if McCarthyists were accusing so many people of being communist agents, it could only be to divert attention from the real communists. The theme of collusion between international communists and Western rightists would be picked up again by many movies (Goldfinger, A View to a Kill) or television shows (episodes of MacGyver or Airwolf), which would feature an alliance between power-hungry communists attacking the free world from the outside and profit- driven capitalists undermining it for financial gain. * Sacrifice by Graham Masterton * Masters of Deceit ‚Äì a non-fiction work written by the FBI, through J.

This acclaimed book, first published in 1962, exposed the horrors of the Russian prison camps during WWII under the Stalinist regime. It is a semi-autobiographical tale about a dutiful soldier who is sent to a Siberian camp, after being falsely accused of treason. Solzhenitsyn received the Nobel Prize in literature. Cinema=Cinema as early Cold War propaganda During the Cold War, films functioned as a means to influence and control public opinion internally. The United States and the Soviet Union invested heavily in propaganda designed to influence the hearts and minds of people around the world, especially using motion pictures.Anthony Shaw and Denise Youngblood, Cinematic Cold War: The American and Soviet struggle for hearts and minds (University Press Kansas, 2010). Cold War films produced by both sides attempted to address different facets of the superpower conflict and sought to influence both domestic and foreign opinion. The gap between American and Soviet film gave the Americans a distinct advantage over the Soviet Union; the United States was readily prepared to utilize their cinematic achievements as a way to effectively impact the public opinion in a way the Soviet Union could not. Cinema, Americans hoped, would help close the gap caused by Soviet development of nuclear weapons and advancements in space technology. The use of film as an effective form of widespread propaganda transformed cinema into another Cold War battlefront. =US cinema= The Americans took advantage of their pre-existing cinematic advantage over the Soviet Union, using movies as another way to create the Communist enemy. In the early years of the Cold War (between 1948‚Äì53), seventy explicitly anti- communist films were released.Tony Shaw and Denise J. Younglood, Cinematic Cold War: The American and Soviet Struggle for Hearts and Minds (2010) pp 20-21 American films incorporated a wide scale of Cold War themes and issues into all genres of film, which gave American motion pictures a particular lead over Soviet film. Despite the audiences' lack of zeal for Anti-Communist/Cold War related cinema, the films produced evidently did serve as successful propaganda in both the United States and the Soviet Union. The films released during this time received a response from the Soviet Union, which subsequently released its own array of films to combat the depiction of the Communist threat. Several organizations played a key role in ensuring that Hollywood acted in the national best interest of the US Catholic Legion of Decency and the Production Code Administration acted as two conservative groups that controlled a great deal of the national repertoire during the early stages of the Cold War. These groups filtered out politically subversive or morally questionable movies. More blatantly illustrating the shift from cinema as an art form to cinema as a form of strategic weapon, the Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals ensured that filmmakers adequately expressed their patriotism. Beyond these cinema-specific efforts, the FBI played a surprisingly large role in the production of movies, instituting a triangular-shaped film strategy: FBI set up a surveillance operation in Hollywood, made efforts to pinpoint and blacklist Communists, secretly laundered intelligence through HUAC, and further helped in producing movies that \\"fostered [the FBI] image as the protector of the American people.\\" The FBI additionally endorsed films, including Oscar winner The Hoaxters.Shaw and Younglood, Cinematic Cold War (2010) pp 20-21 In the 1960s, Hollywood began using spy films to create the enemy through film. Previously, the influence of the Cold War could be seen in many, if not all, genres of American film. By the 1960s, spy films were effectively a \\"weapon of confrontation between the two world systems.\\" Both sides heightened paranoia and created a sense of constant unease in viewers through the increased production of spy films. Film depicted the enemy in a way that caused both sides to increase general suspicion of foreign and domestic threat. =Soviet cinema= Between 1946‚Äì54, the Soviet Union mimicked the US adoption of cinema as a weapon. The Central United Film Studios and the Committee on Cinema Affairs were committed to the Cold War battle. Under Stalin's rule, movies could only be made within strict confines. Cinema and government were, as it stood, inextricably linked. Many films were banned for being insufficiently patriotic. Nonetheless, the Soviet Union produced a plethora of movies with the aim to blatantly function as negative propaganda. In the same fashion as the United States, the Soviets were eager to depict their enemy in the most unflattering light possible. Between 1946 and 1950, 45.6% of on-screen villains in Soviet films were either American or British. Films addressed non-Soviet themes that emerged in American film in an attempt to derail the criticism and paint the US as the enemy. Attacks made by the United States against the Soviet Union were simply used as material by Soviet filmmakers for their own attacks on the US. Soviet cinema during this time took its liberty with history: \\"Did the Red Army engage in the mass rapes of German women and pillage German art treasures, factories, and forests? In Soviet cinema, the opposite was true in [The Meeting on the Elbe].\\" This demonstrated the heightened paranoia of the Soviet Union. Despite efforts made to elevate the status of cinema, such as changing the Committee of Cinema Affairs to the Ministry of Cinematography, cinema did not seem to work as invigorating propaganda as was planned. Although the anti- American films were notably popular with audiences, the Ministry did not feel the message had reached the general public, perhaps due to the fact that the majority of moviegoers seeing the films produced were, perhaps, the Soviets most likely to admire American culture. After Stalin's death, a Main Administration of Cinema Affairs replaced the Ministry, allowing the filmmakers more freedom due to the lack of direct government control. Many of the films released throughout the late 1950s and 1960s focused on spreading a positive image of Soviet life, intent to prove that Soviet life was indeed better than American life. Russian science fiction emerged from a prolonged period of censorship in 1957, opened up by de-Stalinization and real Soviet achievements in the space race, typified by Ivan Efremov's galactic epic, Andromeda (1957). Official Communist science fiction transposed the laws of historical materialism to the future, scorning Western nihilistic writings and predicting a peaceful transition to universal communism. Scientocratic visions of the future nevertheless implicitly critiqued the bureaucratically developed socialism of the present. Dissident science fiction writers emerged, such as the Strugatski brothers, Boris and Arkadi, with their \\"social fantasies,\\" problematizing the role of intervention in the historical process, or Stanislaw Lem's tongue-in-cheek exposures of man's cognitive limitations.Patrick Major, \\"Future Perfect?: Communist Science Fiction in the Cold War.\\" Cold War History 2003 4(1): 71-96.

The Bond movies followed the political climate of the time in their depictions of Soviets and \\"Red\\" Chinese. In the 1954 version of Casino Royale, Bond was an American agent working with the British to destroy a ruthless Soviet agent in France, but became more widely known as Agent 007, James Bond, of Her Majesty's Secret Service, who was played by Sean Connery until 1971 and by several actors since. Although Bond films often used the Cold War as a backdrop, the Soviet Union itself was almost never Bond's enemy, that role being more often left to fictional and apolitical criminal organizations (like the infamous SPECTRE). However, Red China was in league with Bond's enemies in the films Goldfinger, You Only Live Twice and The Man With the Golden Gun, while some later movies (Octopussy, The Living Daylights) featured a rogue Soviet general as the enemy. * TASS Upolnomochen Zayavit...

Twilight Zone episodes commenting on other aspects of the Cold War, and World Peace include the 1986 A Small Talent for War. Television commercials Wendy's Hamburger Chain ran a television commercial showing a supposed \\"Soviet Fashion Show\\", which featured the same large, unattractive woman wearing the same dowdy outfit in a variety of situations, the only difference being the accessory she carried (for example, a flashlight for 'nightwear' or a beach ball for 'swimwear'). This was supposedly a lampoon on how the Soviet society is characterised with uniformity and standardisation, in contrast to the US characterised with freedom of choice, as highlighted in the Wendy's commercial. Apple Computer's \\"1984\\" ad, despite paying homage to George Orwell's novel of the same name, follows a more serious yet ambitious take on the freedom vs. totalitarianism theme evident between the US and Soviet societies at the time. Political commercialsDaisies and mushroom clouds= \\"Daisy\\" advertisement Daisy was the most famous campaign commercial of the Cold War. Aired only once, on 7 September 1964, it was a factor in Lyndon B. Johnson's defeat of Barry Goldwater in the 1964 presidential election. The contents of the commercial were controversial, and their emotional impact was searing. The commercial opens with a very young girl standing in a meadow with chirping birds, slowly counting the petals of a daisy as she picks them one by one. Her sweet innocence, along with mistakes in her counting, endear her to the viewer. When she reaches \\"9\\", an ominous-sounding male voice is suddenly heard intoning the countdown of a rocket launch. As the girl's eyes turn toward something she sees in the sky, the camera zooms in until one of her pupils fills the screen, blacking it out. The countdown reaches zero, and the blackness is instantly replaced by a simultaneous bright flash and thunderous sound which is then followed by footage of a nuclear explosion, an explosion similar in appearance to the near surface burst Trinity test of 1945, followed by another cut to footage of a billowing mushroom cloud. As the fireball ascends, an edit cut is made, this time to a close-up section of incandescence in the mushroom cloud, over which a voiceover from Johnson is played, which states emphatically, \\"These are the stakes! To make a world in which all of God's children can live, or to go into the dark. We must either love each other, or we must die.\\" Another voiceover then says, \\"Vote for President Johnson on November 3. The stakes are too high for you to stay home.\\" (Two months later, Johnson won the election in an electoral landslide.) =Bear in the woods= Bear in the woods was a 1984 campaign advertisement endorsing Ronald Reagan for President. This campaign ad depicted a brown bear wandering through the woods (likely implying the Soviet Union) and suggested that Reagan was more capable of dealing with the Soviets than his opponent, in spite of the fact that the ad never explicitly mentioned the Soviet Union, the Cold War or Walter Mondale. Humor The 1984 \\"We begin bombing in five minutes\\" incident is an example of cold war dark humor. It was a personal microphone gaffe joke between Ronald Reagan, his White House staff and radio technicians that was accidentally leaked to the US populace. At the time, Reagan was well known before this incident for telling Soviet/Russian jokes in televised debates, many of which have now been uploaded to video hosting websites. :My fellow Americans, I'm pleased to tell you today that I've signed legislation that will outlaw Russia forever. We begin bombing in five minutes. The joke was a parody of the opening line of that day's speech: :My fellow Americans, I'm pleased to tell you that today I signed legislation that will allow student religious groups to begin enjoying a right they've too long been denied--the freedom to meet in public high schools during nonschool hours, just as other student groups are allowed to do.Radio Address to the Nation on Congressional Inaction on Proposed Legislation Following his trip to Los Angeles in 1959 and being refused entry into Disneyland, on security grounds, a dejected Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev joked, \\"...just now I was told that I could not go to Disneyland, I asked 'Why not?' What is it, do you have rocket launching pads there?\\" The only person more disappointed than Khrushchev was Walt Disney himself, who claimed he had been looking forward to showing off his 'submarine fleet', which was actually the 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea ride. Arts The United States and the Soviet Union engaged in competition vis-√†-vis the arts. Cultural competition played out in Moscow, New York, London, and Paris. The Soviets excelled at ballet and chess, the Americans at jazz and abstract expressionist paintings.Serge Guilbaut, How New York Stole the Idea of Modern Art: Abstract Expressionism, Freedom, and the Cold War (U. of Chicago Press, 1983). The US funded its own ballet troupes, and both used ballet as political propaganda, using dance to reflect life style in the \\"battle for the hearts and minds of men.\\" The defection of a premier dancer became a major coup.David Caute, The Dancer Defects: The Struggle for Cultural Supremacy during the Cold War (Oxford University Press, 2003) Chess was inexpensive enough‚Äîand the Russians always won until America unleashed Bobby Fischer.Caute, The Dancer Defects: The Struggle for Cultural Supremacy During the Cold War pp 611-613 Vastly more expensive was the Space Race, as a proxy for scientific supremacy (with a technology with obvious military uses).Walter A. McDougall, \\"Sputnik, the Space Race, and the Cold-War.\\" Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists (1985):41#5 20-25. As well when it came to sports the two countries both competed in the Olympics during the Cold War period which also created severe tension when the West boycotted the first Russian Olympics in 1980.Stephen Wagg, and David L. Andrews, eds. East plays west: Sport and the Cold War (Routledge, 2007) Music=1940s As President Franklin D. Roosevelt died and World War II concluded with the detonation of nuclear weapons over Japan in 1945, the stage was quickly set for the emergence of Cold War hostilities between the new superpowers in 1946. Musicians concertizing in the UNited States during this period were suddenly exposed to rapidly shifting diplomatic and political circumstances.

Probably the most famous, passionate and influential of all was Bob Dylan, notably in his songs \\"Masters of War\\" and \\"A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall\\" (written just before the Cuban Missile Crisis). In 1965 Barry McGuire's version of P. F. Sloan's apocalyptic \\"Eve of Destruction\\" was a number one hit in the United States and elsewhere. Van Cliburn was a pianist who was celebrated with a ticker tape parade after winning a musical competition in the Soviet Union. From 1956 through the late 1970s, the US State Department sent its finest jazz musicians to show off music that appealed to youth, to demonstrate racial harmony at home, and to undergird freedom as jazz was a democratic music form, free flowing and improvised. Jazz tours of the Soviet Union were organized in 1956, and lasted through the 1970s.Penny Von Eschen, Satchmo blows up the world: Jazz ambassadors play the cold war (Harvard University Press, 2009)Lisa E. Davenport, Jazz diplomacy: Promoting America in the cold war era (U. Press of Mississippi, 2010). In addition to jazz, the US State Department also supported the performance of classical music by noteworthy American orchestras as part of its cultural diplomacy initiatives during the cold war. In 1961-1962 Howard Hanson's Eastman Philharmonia Orchestra at the Eastman School of Music was selected to represent the nation on an international concert tour which included thirty four cities and sixteen countries in Europe, the Middle East and Russia.Howard Hanson in Theory and Practice Allen Laurence Cohen, Praeger Publishers, CT., 2004 p.13 Howard Hanson and the Eastman Philharmonia on books.google.com The United States Seventh Army also played an integral role in supporting cultural diplomacy and strengthening international ties with Europe during the cold war. The Seventh Army Symphony Orchestra was founded by Corporal Samuel Adler in Stuttgart, Germany as part of an effort by the US Army to demonstrate the common cultural heritage which existed in the United Staets, its European allies and the conquered nations in Europe during the cold war period. The orchestra concertized extensively throughout Europe from 1952 until 1961 and performed works from the classical repertoire as well as contemporary compositions from the United States. Listed among the ensemble's earliest \\"musical ambassadors\\" were several young conductors including: John Ferritto, James Dixon, Kenneth Schermerhorn and Henry Lewis.A Dictionary for the Modern Conductor, Emily Freeman Brown, Scarecrow Press , Oxford, 2015, p. 311 Seventh Army Symphony Orchestra founded by Samuel Adler in 1952 on https://books.google.comUncle Sam's Orchestra: Memories of the Seventh Army Orchestra John Canaria, University of Rochester Press 1998 Seventh Army Symphony on https://books.google.comNew Music New Allies Amy C.

For example, various musical artists wore military uniform-like costumes, as a reflection of the increased feeling of militarism seen in the 1980s. Songs symbolically showed the superpowers going to war, as in the Frankie Goes to Hollywood song \\"Two Tribes\\". This song's MTV music video featured caricatures of United States President Ronald Reagan and Soviet General Secretary Konstantin Chernenko in a wrestling match. Other songs expressed fear of World War III, as in the Sting song, \\"Russians\\", with lyrics such as \\"I don't subscribe to his [Reagan's or Khrushchev's] point of view\\" (that Reagan would protect Europe, or that Khrushchev would \\"bury\\" the West). Other examples include Sly Fox's \\"Let's go all the way\\", a song about \\"going all the way\\" to nuclear war; The Escape Club's \\"Wild Wild West\\" with its various references to the Cold War. The Genesis song \\"Land of Confusion\\" expressed a desire to make some sense out of the world, especially in relation to nuclear war. A number of punk rock bands from the 1980s attacked Cold War era politics, such as Reagan's and Thatcher's nuclear deterrence brinkmanship. A small sampling includes The Clash, Dead Kennedys, Government Issue, Fear, Suicidal Tendencies, Toxic Reasons, Reagan Youth, etc. Noted punk compilation P.E.A.C.E. included bands from around the world in an attempt to promote international peace. The Scars covered apocalyptic poem \\"Your Attention Please\\" by Peter Porter, a radio broadcast announcing nuclear war. Probably the most famous of the 1980s songs against increased confrontation between the Soviets and the Americans was Nena's \\"99 Luftballons\\", which described the events ‚Äì ostensibly starting with the innocent release of 99 (red) toy balloons ‚Äì that could lead to a nuclear war.

Whidbey Telecom is unusual in the region because it is locally owned and has never been a part of a larger company. Whidbey Telecom is also unusual in that 100% of the lines it services are buried underground. The company attributes this action to an area racked with storms that cause frequent down trees and power outages. History Whidbey Telephone was founded in 1908 by local business owners and farmers in Langley, Washington. They wanted to provide telephone service to the community but wanted to keep the ownership local to prevent an outside company from interfering in the affairs of the Whidbey Island community. All residents of South Whidbey had access to the Whidbey Telephone system by 1920. The company prospered, but after World War II an influx of new residents began to tax the small phone company. By 1950, the company began to make major upgrades to its network but began to lose money. In 1953 local businessman, David C. Henny purchased a controlling interest in Whidbey Telephone Company. Under his leadership, the company was able to restructure and become profitable again, all the while completing much-needed upgrades to the infrastructure. The Henny family still controls the company. Winters in Washington bring many storms. Until 1961, Whidbey Telephone had overhead wires, and when the storms came, the lines went down due to wind, trees, and snow. After several winters, where more than 60% of their customers lost service, the company decided to bury its entire network. By 1961, 100% of its lines were buried, a first for local telephone companies. Since then there has not been widespread service disruption due to infrastructure damage. Whidbey Telephone became the first local phone company (west of the Rocky Mountains) to provide Internet access to its customers, in 1994. In 2000, while many phone companies were just beginning to offer DSL services, Whidbey began an aggressive campaign to provide the service to all of its customers. In just two years, the entire service area, including Point Roberts and Hat Island had DSL service available. For a few years, the company's Internet division, Whidbey.NET, even offered DSL to residents in Verizon territory on Whidbey Island and other local communities. Whidbey Telecom's current internet and phone service area includes all of South Whidbey Island, including Clinton, Langley, Freeland and most of Greenbank, Washington. In 2017 Whidbey Telecom kicked off an ambitious program to bring The BiG GiG¬Æ Fiber Network to South Whidbey, becoming the only internet provider on Whidbey Island to provide synchronous upload and download speeds of up to 1000 Mbps for both residential and business subscribers. In 2019, Whidbey Telecom introduced The BiG GiG Fiber Network in Point Roberts, Washington. Internet services Internet services on Whidbey Island began in 1994. Whidbey Telephone began Whidbey Internet Services (WIS) to cover the telephone company's service area. At the same time, another company, Whidbey Connections, Inc. (WCI), was founded to serve customers of GTE on the north end of the island. WIS soon expanded to cover people on the north end of the Island, and WCI later expanded to also serve people on the south end of Whidbey Island. WCI's Internet domain was 'whidbey.net', whereas WIS's was 'whidbey.com'. Initial available Internet speeds were 14.4kbit/s and later 28.8kbit/s, as demand grew. In 1995, Whidbey Telephone Company acquired the assets of Whidbey Connections, Inc., and integrated into Whidbey Internet Service to form WhidbeyNET. As a result of the merger, some customers of Whidbey.NET on the south end of Whidbey continue to have '.net' addresses whereas most south end customers have '.com'. Until 2001, WhidbeyNET maintained two different customer databases on their servers, leading some customers to have different passwords, and even different usernames depending on how and where they connected to the ISP. Whidbey.NET began to offer DSL services to some customers (within one mile of local exchange systems) in 2000. By 2002, all Whidbey Telephone customers were capable of receiving Whidbey.NET DSL on south Whidbey Island and in Point Roberts. In 2005, the newly rebranded Whidbey Telecom Internet and Broadband began offering 5.5 Mbit/s DSL, and set their other speeds at 512kbit/s, and 2.5 Mbit/s. However, Whidbey Telecom does not offer DSL services in Verizon territory on Whidbey Island, but does still provide dial-up services in those areas. In the spring of 2009, Whidbey Telecom began upgrading customers, free of charge, from ADSL to ADSL2+ services. This included speed upgrades to 18Mbit/s, 12Mbit/s, and 6Mbit/s. A new 30Mbit/s bonded ADSL2+ service was also made available at that time. Additionally, existing dial-up customers were offered a discounted 3Mbit/s service, in advance of Whidbey Telecom's phasing out their dial-up service on South Whidbey and in Point Roberts which was completed by Summer 2010. With the addition of Television services, even faster Internet connections have become available, utilizing VDSL2+ technologies up to 50Mbit/s. In 2016, Whidbey Telecom announced n an aggressive campaign to install Fiber to the Home. Known as \\"The Big Gig\\", the service offers 1Gbit/s synchronous service to homes and businesses. The first customers were connected by October of that same year. The initial build out is focusing on the communities of Langley, Freeland, Clinton, and Bayview; but will expand to cover much of the current service area. Free WiFi Hotspots are also available throughout the community, at public and private buildings, community parks, the Fairgrounds, and the Ferry Holding Lines. All are free to use for anyone needing access. Television It was announced in 2011, that Whidbey Telecom would offer television to customers at competitive rates to those offered by Comcast. The service utilized Microsoft Mediaroom IPTV technology to deliver television over the DSL service. The new WhidbeyTV service was launched in the summer of 2013, with great fanfare, and quickly became the significant player in the community, with competitive pricing, local support services, and its own channel, called \\"WhidbeyTV\\", producing original shows and sharing local content. The service is cost competitive with the other terrestrial options, and continued to expand offerings and service areas until 2018. It is currently limited to South Whidbey, and not all of South Whidbey qualifies due to the dedicated bandwidth required for television not being easily available in some pockets, but upgrades are being made to the network to bring the WhidbeyTV's service areas in line with those of Internet & Broadband. In late 2018, Whidbey Telecom announced it was shifting its TV strategy from providing linear TV to partnering with Dish. This shift was due to the dramatic rise in content costs and of a fundamental change in viewing habits of society from linear to streaming entertainment. While it was a difficult decision by the company it enabled Whidbey Telecom to focus on strengthening its investment in its local fiber optic network to its customers. The company continues to provide its local WhidbeyTV video, streaming for free through WhidbeyTV.com. Rebranding In 2004, Whidbey Telephone company decided to consolidate its operations under a single name, Whidbey Telecom. This new identity was previewed at the Island County Fair and was officially launched in September. *'Whidbey.NET' became 'Whidbey Telecom Internet and Broadband' *'Western Long Distance' became 'Whidbey Telecom Long Distance' *'American Alarm Systems, Inc.' became 'Whidbey Telecom Security and Alarms' Service area and Exchanges All operate in Area Code 360 Whidbey Island Any new customers or lines are assigned numbers based on geographic location, but customers are no longer required to change prefix when moving between service areas. *Clinton - 341 *Freeland - 331 *Langley - 221 *Bayview - 321 *Locales outside of the service area with a South Whidbey number (Foreign Exchange) - 321 *Maxwellton Beach, Scatchet Head, and Sandy Hook/Cultus Bay - 579 *Bells Beach, Baby Island, Beverly Beach - 730 *Greenbank - 222 Point Roberts *All Areas - 945 Hat (Gedney) Island Hat Island Telephone Company *All Areas - 444 Telecommunications companies of the United States ","title":"Whidbey Telecom"},{"id":"6355933","text":"Christmas Songs is a 1992 studio album by the American jazz singer Mel Torm√©.

Roughly speaking, a collection Y of mathematical objects may be said to represent another collection X of objects, provided that the properties and relationships existing among the representing objects yi conform, in some consistent way, to those existing among the corresponding represented objects xi. More specifically, given a set Œ† of properties and relations, a Œ†-representation of some structure X is a structure Y that is the image of X under a homomorphism that preserves Œ†. The label representation is sometimes also applied to the homomorphism itself (such as group homomorphism in group theory).  Representation theory  Perhaps the most well-developed example of this general notion is the subfield of abstract algebra called representation theory, which studies the representing of elements of algebraic structures by linear transformations of vector spaces.  Other examples  Although the term representation theory is well established in the algebraic sense discussed above, there are many other uses of the term representation throughout mathematics.  Graph theory  An active area of graph theory is the exploration of isomorphisms between graphs and other structures. A key class of such problems stems from the fact that, like adjacency in undirected graphs, intersection of sets (or, more precisely, non-disjointness) is a symmetric relation. This gives rise to the study of intersection graphs for innumerable families of sets. One foundational result here, due to Paul Erd≈ës and his colleagues, is that every n-vertex graph may be represented in terms of intersection among subsets of a set of size no more than n2/4. Representing a graph by such algebraic structures as its adjacency matrix and Laplacian matrix gives rise to the field of spectral graph theory.  Order theory  Dual to the observation above that every graph is an intersection graph is the fact that every partially ordered set (also known as poset) is isomorphic to a collection of sets ordered by the inclusion (or containment) relation ‚äÜ. Some posets that arise as the inclusion orders for natural classes of objects include the Boolean lattices and the orders of dimension n. Many partial orders arise from (and thus can be represented by) collections of geometric objects. Among them are the n-ball orders. The 1-ball orders are the interval- containment orders, and the 2-ball orders are the so-called circle orders‚Äîthe posets representable in terms of containment among disks in the plane. A particularly nice result in this field is the characterization of the planar graphs, as those graphs whose vertex-edge incidence relations are circle orders. There are also geometric representations that are not based on inclusion. Indeed, one of the best studied classes among these are the interval orders, which represent the partial order in terms of what might be called disjoint precedence of intervals on the real line: each element x of the poset is represented by an interval [x1, x2], such that for any y and z in the poset, y is below z if and only if y2 < z1.  Logic  In logic, the representability of algebras as relational structures is often used to prove the equivalence of algebraic and relational semantics. Examples of this include Stone's representation of Boolean algebras as fields of sets,Marshall H. Stone (1936) \\"The Theory of Representations of Boolean Algebras,\\" Transactions of the American Mathematical Society 40: 37-111. Esakia's representation of Heyting algebras as Heyting algebras of sets, and the study of representable relation algebras and representable cylindric algebras.  Polysemy  Under certain circumstances, a single function f : X ‚Üí Y is at once an isomorphism from several mathematical structures on X. Since each of those structures may be thought of, intuitively, as a meaning of the image Y (one of the things that Y is trying to tell us), this phenomenon is called polysemy‚Äîa term borrowed from linguistics. Some examples of polysemy include: * intersection polysemy‚Äîpairs of graphs G1 and G2 on a common vertex set V that can be simultaneously represented by a single collection of sets Sv, such that any distinct vertices u and w in V are adjacent in G1, if and only if their corresponding sets intersect ( Su ‚à© Sw ‚â† √ò ), and are adjacent in G2 if and only if the complements do ( SuC ‚à© SwC ‚â† √ò ). * competition polysemy‚Äîmotivated by the study of ecological food webs, in which pairs of species may have prey in common or have predators in common. A pair of graphs G1 and G2 on one vertex set is competition polysemic, if and only if there exists a single directed graph D on the same vertex set, such that any distinct vertices u and v are adjacent in G1, if and only if there is a vertex w such that both uw and vw are arcs in D, and are adjacent in G2, if and only if there is a vertex w such that both wu and wv are arcs in D. * interval polysemy‚Äîpairs of posets P1 and P2 on a common ground set that can be simultaneously represented by a single collection of real intervals, that is an interval-order representation of P1 and an interval-containment representation of P2.

According to the most recent estimate (2017), the people of Wolayta numbered 2.4 million in Welayta Zone only, or 2.31 percent of the country's population, of whom 289,707 are city-dwellers.\\"Census 2007\\", first draft, Table 5. The language of the Wolayta people, similarly called Wolaytta, belongs to the Omotic branch of the Afro- Asiatic language family. Despite their small population, Wolayta people have widely influenced national music, dance and cuisine in Ethiopia. History Wolayta chief Kawa Tona The people of Wolayta had their own kingdom for hundreds of years with kings (called \\"Kawo\\") and a monarchical administration. The earlier name of the kingdom was allegedly \\"Damot\\" - this was said to include the south, south-east, south-west and part of the central region of present Ethiopia. The ruler was King (Kawo) Motolomi who is mentioned in the religious book Gedle Teklehaimanot, as an invader of the north and the king to whom was surrendered the mother of the Ethiopian saint, Tekle Haymanot. Some assume that the saint was the son of this king. After the defeat which overcame the northern part of its territory the kingdom was reduced to its present size and the name became the Kingdom of Wolayta. It remained thus an independent kingdom for hundreds of years until the expansion of Emperor Menelik II into the regions south of Shewa during the early 1890s. The war of conquest has been described by Bahru Zewde as \\"one of the bloodiest campaigns of the whole period of expansion\\", and Wolayta oral tradition holds that 118,000 Welayta and 90,000 Shewan troops died in the fighting.Sarah Vaughan, \\"Ethnicity and Power in Ethiopia\\" (University of Edinburgh: Ph.D. Thesis, 2003), p. 253. Kawo (King) Tona, the last king of Welayta, was defeated and Welayta conquered in 1896. Welayta was then incorporated into the Ethiopian Empire. However, Welayta had a form of self-administrative status and was ruled by Governors directly accountable to the king until the fall of Emperor Haile Selassie in 1974. The Derg afterwards restructured the country and included Welayta as a part of the province of Sidamo. The Welayta were previously known as \\"Wolamo\\", although this term is now considered derogatory. In 1991 the Transitional Government of Ethiopia (TGE) restructured the country into ethnically-based Regions, and Welayta became the centre of Region 9. Later, Welayta was included in the Southern Nations, Nationalities, and People's Region (SNNPR, consisting of the former regions 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11) as part of the Semien Omo Zone. The regional government claimed that the Welayta were so closely related to the other Omotic-speaking peoples of that zone that there was no justification for a separate Welayta zone. Welayta leaders, however, stressed that their people had a distinct language and culture and demanded a zone for themselves. In 1998, the regional government attempted to introduce an artificially constructed language, based on the various local North Omotic languages and dialects, as the new language of education and administration for Semien Omo Zone. This triggered violent protests by Welayta students, teachers and civil servants, which led to the withdrawal of the new language. In November 2000, the Welayta Zone was established. Welayta language Welayta is an Omotic language spoken in the Wolaita Zone and some parts of the Southern Nations, Nationalities, and People's Region of Ethiopia. The number of speakers of this language is estimated at 1,800,000 (1991 UBS); it is the native language of the Welayta people. There are conflicting claims about how widely Welayta is spoken. The 'Ethnologue' identifies one smaller dialect region: Zala. Some hold that Melo, Oyda, and Gamo-Gofa-Dawro are also dialects, but most authorities, including Ethnologue and ISO 639-3 now list these as separate languages. The different communities of speakers also recognize them as separate languages. Welayta has existed in written form since the 1940s, when the Sudan Interior Mission first devised a system for writing it. The writing system was later revised by a team led by Dr. Bruce Adams. They finished the New Testament in 1981 and the entire Bible in 2002. It was one of the first languages the Derg selected for their literacy campaign (1979‚Äì1991). Welaytta pride in their written language led to a fiercely hostile response in 1998 when the Ethiopian government distributed textbooks written in Wegagoda ‚Äì an artificial language based on amalgamating Wolaytta with several closely related languages. As a result, the textbooks in Wegagoda were withdrawn and teachers returned to ones in Wolaytta. The Welayta people use many proverbs. A large collection of them was published in 1987 (Ethiopian calendar) by the Academy of Ethiopian Languages. Fikre Alemayehu's 2012 MA thesis from Addis Ababa University provides an analysis of Wolaytta proverbs and their functions.  Welayta music  320x320px Welayta music plays a prominent role in national entertainment in Ethiopia. The unique and fast-paced Welayta tunes have influenced several styles and rhythm as it continues to shape the identity of Ethiopian musical diversity. Various famous Ethiopian artists from other ethnic groups have incorporated Welayta musical style into their songs, including vocalists Tibebu Workeye,Teddy afro and Tsehaye Yohannes. Just as influential are Welayta traditional dance forms that are often adopted by musicians and widely visible in Ethiopian music videos. Food 236x236px Raw beef, commonly known as ‚ÄúKurt‚Äù is deep rooted cultural food by Welayta people. Little is known on the origin of raw meat eating habit. Minced raw beef called ‚ÄúKitfo‚Äù by the Gurage people and Kurt are mostly served on special occasions such as holidays like \\"Finding of the True Cross\\" or \\"Meskel\\" holiday, celebrated annually on September 27 in Ethiopia. Moreover, Enset foods are traditionally incorporated into cultural events such as births, deaths, weddings, and rites of planting, harvesting and purification.

He was the holder of the world record in the 50 m freestyle in a time of 20.94 in long course, set on 26 April 2009 at the final of the French Championships. Since the record was swum in a banned, performance-enhancing suit it remained in limbo whether the record stood until FINA approved it in July following a modification of his suit.FINA OKs Frederick Bousquet's world record time in 50 free. Retrieved on 2009-07-19. He is the first swimmer to go under the 21-second mark in this distance. He previously held the record in the 50 m short course in a time of 21.10, set in 2004 at the Men's NCAA Division One Swimming and Diving Championships, for over two years. At the 2009 World Championships in Rome Bousquet competed in the 50 and 100 free, capturing a silver in the 50 and bronze in the 100. Bousquet did not qualify for the 2012 Olympics but his ex-partner Laure Manaudou and his brother-in-law Florent Manaudou did. Biography Bousquet swam at Auburn University in the U.S. from 2001 to 2005. In 2005, his senior year and final year of competition, he won the 50-yard freestyle in NCAA and U.S. Open record time of 18.74, shattering the previous record of 19.05 set by Tom Jager in 1990. Bousquet is the first man ever to swim the 50-yard freestyle in under 19 seconds, and under 21 in the LC 50-meter freestyle. That time of 18.74 seconds was his personal best in the 50-yard freestyle until 13 February 2010 when he swam the then fourth-fastest time in history, turning in a time of 18.67 seconds at the Auburn Masters Invitational. In April 2010, fellow world-class swimmer Laure Manaudou gave birth to her and Bousquet's daughter Manon. The couple has separated since then.

He decided to give up his career in order to spend more time with his children. To do this, he moved to Kenosha, Wisconsin, where he supported his family by contributing a column about \\"real people\\" to a Chicago newspaper. His editor, Joe Baines (Jeffrey Tambor), felt Tom was completely wasting his talents and drove out from Chicago weekly (a huge sacrifice, from his viewpoint) to attempt to convince Tom to return the world of \\"hard news\\".

The clan does not have a Chief recognised by Lord Lyon King of Arms, and therefore can be considered an armigerous clan.http://www.electricscotland.com/webclans/clanmenu.htm Retrieved on 28 July 2007 Today, it is thought by some that Clan MacLennan is a variant of the Highland Logan clan. History James Logan in 1831 The surname Logan is a territorial name, likely derived from the lands of Logan in present Ayrshire, Scotland. The earliest record of the surname is of Robert Logan who is recorded as witnessing the resignation of the lands of Ingilbristoun in 1204. The name is variously recorded throughout the 13th century. Several Logans are recorded as paying homage to Edward I of England within the Ragman Rolls of 1296. These are Phelippe de Logyn (burgess from Montrose), Thurbrandus de Logyn (from Dumfrieshire), Andreu de Logan (from Wigtonshire), and Wautier Logan (from Lanarkshire). The seal of Wautier Logan (SIGILLVM WALTERI LOGAN) is blazoned a stag's head cabossed, between the antlers, a shield with three piles. Walter Logan, lord of Hartside was a sheriff of Lanark in 1301, and in 1298 had received a grant of the lands of \\"Lus\\" from Robert Bruce.Barrow, p. 224. This Walter Logan appears twice on a roll of landowners forfeited in 1306 by Edward I, for supporting Robert the Bruce. The first instance of Logan has John Cromwell as the petitioner for Logan's forfeited lands, while the second instance of Walter Logan has William Mulcaster and John Bisset petitioning for his lands.Barrow, pp. 447-448. In 1306 Dominus Walter Logan was taken prisoner by the English forces and hanged at Durham, in the presence of Edward of Carnarvon (the future Edward II of England).Anderson, pp. 687-688. In 1330 brothers Sir Robert Logan of Restalrig and Sir Walter Logan; along with Sir William de Keith, Sir William de St. Clair of Rosslyn; accompanied Sir James Douglas in his quest to take the heart of the dead King Robert I of Scotland to the Holy Land.Bain, pp. 138-139. Douglas and his company had been received by Alfonso XI of Castile, who campaigning against the Moors, in the Kingdom of Granada. Near the Castillo de la Estrella, Alfonso's army fought the Saracens at the Battle of Teba. During the battle Douglas observed a knight of his company surrounded by Moorish warriors, and with his remaining men attempted to relieve his countryman. As the knights were hard pressed and outnumbered by the Moors, Sir James Douglas took the silver casket containing the heart of Robert Bruce, and threw it before him among the enemy, saying, \\"Now pass thou onward before us, as thou wert wont, and I will follow thee or die.\\" Sir James Douglas and most of his men were slain, among them Sir Robert Logan and Sir Walter Logan. The leading Logan family's principal seat was in Lastalrig or Restalrig, near Edinburgh. Sir Robert Logan of Restalrig married Katherine Stewart, daughter of Robert II of Scotland, and later in 1400 Sir Robert was appointed Admiral of Scotland. Sir Robert Logan was one of the hostages given in 1424 to free James I of Scotland from being held in England. Robert's son or grandson, John Logan of Restalrig, was made principal sheriff of Edinburgh by James II of Scotland. In 1555 Logan of Restalrig sold the superiority of Leith (the principal seaport of Edinburgh) to the queen regent Mary of Lorraine, also known as Marie de Guise. The last Logan to possess the barony was Robert Logan of Restalrig, who was described by contemporaries as \\"ane godless, drunkin, and deboshit man\\". Sir Walter Scott described him as \\"one of the darkest characters of that dark age\\". The last Logan of Logan, in Ayrshire was celebrated for both his wit and eccentricity. Logan was known for his The Laird of Logan, published after his death, which was a compilation of amusing anecdotes and puns. He had one daughter, who married a Mr. Campbell. Relationship with Clan MacLennan=Shared tartans \\"Logan\\". A Victorian era romanticised depiction of a member of the clan by R. R. McIan, from The Clans of the Scottish Highlands, published in 1845. Today both clans Logan and MacLennan share the same tartan. This tartan was first recorded in 1831 by the historian James Logan, in his book The Scottish Ga√´l. Later in 1845 The Clans of the Scottish Highlands was published, which consisted of text from Logan, accompanied by illustrations from R. R. McIan. This work was the first which showed the MacLennan's sharing the same tartan as the Logans. The text on the history of Clan Logan pointed to an ancient link between the Logans and MacLennans. The plate for MacLennan, shows a man from this clan wearing the Logan tartan, but no name is given to it unlike every other clan tartan shown. Given the style of writing at the time and subtleties used by both the artist and writer, this is not a surprise and allows them to pay homage to the story of the origin of MacLennan. Until the early nineteenth century there was no such thing as \\"clan tartans\\". The founder of the MacLennans was at best the great grandson of Gilliegorm Logan (a mythical Chief of Clan Logan from circa 1372), and was far removed from the holdings of the Clan Logan. The MacLennan were subservient to clans Fraser and MacKenzie at various times. Chiefly Arms The issue of Chiefly Arms has come up as a point of contention, with the heart of the Bruce being incorporated into the Arms of the MacLennan Chief, being given as proof of relationship. This could however not be further from the truth. The current Chief of MacLennan may have a heart in his Arms, but the recorded Arms of the Chiefly line of MacLennan were of a shield argent, three piles (long points), sable, in chief, and in base, a cross crosslet fitchee, gules. The Crest was an arm and broadsword, proper, with the Motto (same as current) Dum Spiro Spero \\"While I breathe, I hope\\". The Arms and Crest of the old line of MacLennan Chiefs show no regard to Logan heritage at all. The Clan MacLennan has also apparently added to this controversy by stating that the first known of that name was Duncan MacLennan of Strathearn. Duncan is mentioned in a charter of King Alexander II in 1217 as being the Laird of Bombie, and it is through him that the MacLellans are said to have originated (by the MacLennans only). This is over one hundred years before the birth of the child of Gilligorm Logan. This history is further complicated by the mention of Lide MacLennan and his twelve hundred men in the authenticity debated Ossianic poetry, which is purported to be sixth century. St. Adomn√°n of Iona is also said to have recorded that they occupied Glenshiel at this time. Other sources on MacLennan, cite that the clan was at Eilean Donan castle before 1263 and that the MacGillafinnens, or MacLennans, were titled Lords of Loch Erne, Tairg, and Muintir Peodachain. With all of the evidence to suggest that MacLennan are an old and proud clan, and in existence as long or longer than that of Logan, the descendantcy of the current line of MacLennan Chiefs includes none of this. They cite their origin to Gille Fhinnein, grandson of Gilligorm Logan, and show no connection to any MacLennan before this time. Clan symbols Skene and Rose. Today Scottish clans use crest badges, clan badges (plant badges) and tartan as symbols to represent themselves. The crest badge suitable for members of Clan Logan contains the heraldic crest of a passion nail piercing a human heart, Proper; and the heraldic motto HOC MAJORUM VIRTUS, which translates from Latin as \\"this is valour of my ancestors\\". The plant badge (clan badge) associated with Clan Logan is furze (gorse). According to Robert Bain, the slogan of Clan Logan is Druim-nan-deur (translation from Scottish Gaelic: \\"the ridge of tears\\"). The tartan most commonly associated with the surname Logan is identical to that of Clan MacLennan. The sett was first published by James Logan's The Scottish Ga√´l of 1831. There are however earlier dated tartans which are attributed to the name Logan. One such tartan is usually known as a Skene tartan, though it has sometimes been known as a Rose tartan. The official state tartan of Utah is based upon this tartan, in respect of Ephraim Logan who is considered the first American of Scottish descent who left a permanent mark on Utah.

After 1782 it had a county designation added, becoming known as the 55th (Westmorland) Regiment of Foot. Under the Childers Reforms it amalgamated with the 34th (Cumberland) Regiment of Foot to form the Border Regiment in 1881. History=Formation Recreation of the uniform of the regiment, c.1755 Lord George Augustus Viscount Howe, who was killed while commanding the regiment in a skirmish the day before the Battle of Carillon in July 1758, by Sir Joshua Reynolds The regiment was raised in Stirling by Colonel George Perry as the 57th Regiment of Foot in 1755 for service in the Seven Years' War. It was re-ranked as the 55th Regiment of Foot, following the disbandment of the existing 50th and 51st regiments, in 1756. French and Indian War service The regiment embarked for North America for service in the French and Indian War and arrived in Nova Scotia on 8 July 1757 with the objective of taking part in the abandoned attack on the Fortress of Louisbourg. Following the death of Colonel Perry, Lord George Augustus Viscount Howe was appointed Colonel of the regiment in September 1757. After the regiment arrived in Albany, New York in November 1757, Howe accompanied Major Robert Rogers, commander of His Majesty's Independent Companies of Rangers on a scout, to learn the art of \\"bush fighting.\\"Knox, p. 185-186 Howe's willingness to learn from the American rangers and his interaction with subordinates won him the respect of both colonist and British redcoat being described as the \\"Idol of the army.\\"Putnam, p. 23 In the spring of 1758, Howe began to train and accoutre the men in the regiment more like rangers to better adapt them to warfare in America. He was killed in a skirmish the day before the Battle of Carillon in July 1758. After Howe's death John Prideaux was appointed commander of the regiment. In an unfortunate accident Prideaux was killed by the blast of a cohorn while walking through the entrenchments during the Battle of Fort Niagara in July 1759. The regiment, as part of General Jeffery Amherst's army, participated in the Battle of Ticonderoga and the capture of Fort Crown Point later that month. In 1760 Colonel James Adolphus Oughton took command of the regiment and led it up the Saint Lawrence River: the regiment witnessed the Montreal Campaign between August to September 1760. William Gansell became the colonel of the regiment in 1762. Pontiac's War In summer 1763, volunteers from the regiment were sent to reinforce the British post at Fort Detroit, which was under siege from neighbouring Native Americans led by Pontiac. The British force was ambushed and badly mauled en route at the Battle of Bloody Run in July 1763. In 1764 many surviving members of the regiment were drafted into the 17th Regiment of Foot. Anne Grant, whose father was an officer in the 55th Regiment, wrote; \\"they were going to become part of a regiment of no repute; whom they themselves had held in the utmost contempt when they formerly served together.\\"Grant, p. 237 American Revolutionary War The Siege of Brimstone Hill at which most of the regiment were captured in February 1782 The regiment returned to North America for the American Revolutionary War. The regiment fought at the Battle of Long Island in August 1776 and the Battle of Princeton in January 1777. It went on to take part in the Philadelphia campaign and saw action at the Battle of Brandywine in September 1777, the Battle of Paoli later that month and the Battle of Germantown in October 1777. The regiment was transferred to the West Indies in November 1778 and saw action at the Battle of St. Lucia in December 1778. Most of the regiment were captured at the Siege of Brimstone Hill in February 1782 during the French invasion of Saint Kitts. The regiment adopted a county designation as the 55th (the Westmoreland) Regiment of Foot in August 1782. Napoleonic Wars In 1793 the regiment embarked for Flanders for service in the French Revolutionary Wars and saw action at the Siege of Ypres in June 1794. It then moved to the West Indies and took part in the attack on Martinique in February 1794, on Saint Lucia in April 1794 and on Guadeloupe later that month as well as the capture of Saint Lucia in May 1796. It also helped suppress an insurrection by caribs on Saint Vincent in June 1796. After returning to England in 1797 the regiment landed at Ostend in 1798 for service in the Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland. It saw action at the Battle of Bergen in September 1799 and the Battle of Alkmaar in October 1799. After returning home in 1800 the regiment was deployed to the West Indies again in 1800 and went to the aid of Britain's new found Spanish allies during the Spanish reconquest of Santo Domingo in July 1809. The regiment returned home in 1812 and, having been sent to Holland in 1813, took part in the Siege of Bergen op Zoom in March 1814. The Victorian era The regiment at the Battle of Inkerman in November 1854 The regiment sailed for the Cape of Good Hope in 1819 and saw action in the Fifth Xhosa War. It also served in the Coorg War in 1834. In 1841 the regiment was deployed to China for service in the First Opium War. It was selected as part of the expeditionary force that moved north from Hong Kong and participated in the Battle of Amoy in August 1841.Frontier and Overseas Expeditions From India, pp. 380-382 The regiment was the first to land when British forces disembarked from boats at the Capture of Chusan in October 1841. It landed on a beach and then assaulted an enemy strong point called Guards Hill, where it ascended under heavy fire but eventually took the hill. It then proceeded to take the heights overlooking Tinghai and then immediately descended and placed its regimental colours on the walls of the city.MacPherson, pp. 213-217 After the battle, a detachment of the 55th and 18th Regiment of Foot were left to garrison the city. On 10 October 1841 the 55th again was part of the force that engaged Qing troops at the Battle of Chinhai: the regiment was left to garrison the city after the battle and remained there for the remainder of the year.Frontier and Overseas Expeditions From India, pp. 385-385 In 1842, the regiment saw action at Chapu in May, and Chinkiang in July. It then garrisoned Chinkiang until the Treaty of Nanking was signed. Part of the regiment remained in Hong Kong after the war.Frontier and Overseas Expeditions From India, pp. 386-392 For its service during the war it was allowed the addition of a dragon badge superscribed \\"China\\" on its regimental colour. The regiment saw active service in Turkey and Russia during the Crimean War. The regiment saw action at the Battle of Alma in September 1854, the Battle of Inkerman in November 1854 and the Siege of Sevastopol in winter 1854. After returning home in 1857 it was deployed to India in 1863 and saw action during the Bhutan War in 1864. As part of the Cardwell Reforms of the 1870s, where single-battalion regiments were linked together to share a single depot and recruiting district in the United Kingdom, the 55th was linked with the 34th (Cumberland) Regiment of Foot, and assigned to district no. 2 at Carlisle Castle. On 1 July 1881 the Childers Reforms came into effect and the regiment amalgamated with the 34th (Cumberland) Regiment of Foot to form the Border Regiment with the former 55th forming the 2nd battalion. There is a memorial chapel for the Border Regiment, housing the colours of the 55th regiment, at Kendal Parish Church.

Along with Coombe and Kingston Vale it is one of the more affluent areas in the borough. History  The area has a long history as the ancient parish of Malden, derived from the Old English m√¶l duna, meaning 'the cross on the hill'. Malden appears in Domesday Book of 1086 as Meldone, held partly by William de Wateville and partly by Robert de Wateville. Its domesday assets were: 4 hides and 3 virgates; 1 chapel, 1 mill worth 12s, 6¬Ω ploughs, of meadow, woodland worth 1 hog out of 7 hogs. It rendered ¬£7 12s 0d. St John the Baptist Church, close to the Hogsmill, dates back to Saxon times. In 1611 the chancel's old flint walls were repaired and the nave and the tower rebuilt in brick. In 1875 a new nave and chancel were added, and in 2004 a two-storey extension was completed. The Grade II listed Manor House, next to St John's, is also mentioned in the Domesday Book; in 1264 Walter de Merton, Bishop of Rochester, founded a college here that was later moved to Oxford as Merton College. The house was later used as a court in the reign of Henry VIII, and in the mid 18th century the house was the home of Captain Cook. In 1852 the Hogsmill River was the setting for the background of Ophelia painted by John Everett Millais. Malden became Old Malden in 1870, with the development of New Malden, two miles (3 km) to the north in the parish of Kingston upon Thames. Geography St John the Baptist Church, showing 2004 extension Plough Pond The Plough The A Roma restaurant (closed for redevelopment in 2018) Old Malden Library At the heart of Old Malden is Plough Green, a traditional village green, surrounded by: * The Plough, a 15th-century public house, containing a Miller & Cooper restaurant; * a small parade of shops, which includes the Plough Bakery, Persian, Japanese and Italian restaurants, a hairdresser, a barber, a dentist and two convenience stores * another Italian restaurant (closed for redevelopment in 2018) * Plough Pond Plough Green is used in the summer to hold two fetes; one for St John the Baptist Church and the other for the local Scouts. To the west of Plough Green is Old Malden Library. The Parish Church of Old Malden is St John the Baptist, and can be found just beyond the width restriction in Church Road. There was a church building here at the time of the Domesday Book. The present building comprises the 1611 re-build, the 1875 extension and another extension added in 2004. The Vicar is the Revd Michael Roper who was inducted to the benefice in 2019. Old Malden is served by Malden Manor station to the north and Worcester Park station to the south, both 25 minutes from Waterloo. Malden Road, joining the green and Worcester Park station, was flanked by two rows of over forty mature poplar trees until 2010, when most were felled as a safety measure due to internal rotting. Replacement oaks were planted later that year. A minor tributary of the River Thames, the Hogsmill, flows through the west of Old Malden. Conservation Area  Old Malden Conservation Area was created in March 1971, designating the area as being \\"of special architectural or historic interest the character or appearance of which it is desirable to preserve or enhance\\". (Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, Section 69). It contains two distinct parts, St Johns‚Äô and Plough Green, whose special character is summarised in the designation as: St Johns‚Äô: A medieval village centre above the Hogsmill River, containing the Saxon Church of St. John the Baptist, the site of its vicarage, the 18th century Manor House and ancient fields.

He held the post of Second Vice President in Malawi, under President Bakili Muluzi. He is often called the 'father of Malawian democracy'. He served as leader of Malawi's first underground political movement, which urged President Hastings Kamuzu Banda, who had ruled for three decades, to call for a referendum on political pluralism. He was awarded the Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights Award in 1992. Early life and career Chihana was born in Mhuju Village, Kawiluwilu, in the Northern Region of Nyasaland (Colonial Malawi). His father died when he was young and he was raised by his mother, an activist for local women. After secondary school, he worked for the colonial government and became active in the 4000-strong Commercial General Union, a Trade Union. In 1958, he became the union's publicity secretary and magazine editor. The following year, aged 21, he was made secretary-general of the Trade Union. He was active in campaigns involving Malawi Railways and the Imperial Tobacco Group. He studied at Oslo and Dubrovnik universities and received a Masters in Politics at Bradford University. He worked as a lecturer at the University of Botswana. In 1985, he became a co-founder and secretary general of the Southern Africa trade union coordinating council. Political activism=Anti-colonial struggle Chihana joined the anti-colonial Malawi Congress party (MCP) that was spearheading opposition to the (Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland) and to British rule in Nyasaland. By the end of 1963 the federation had collapsed and Kamuzu Banda became prime minister of the newly independent Malawi. As Banda began to consolidate his power after his presidency, Chihana continued to support independent trade unions and political democracy. As a result, Banda dismissed Chihana from the MCP. He was ordered into internal exile and assaulted. He escaped secretly into Kenya, through help from a Roman Catholic Priest. He continued to criticize Kamuzu Banda in Kenya while working as an adviser to the Kenya Federation of Labour.  Political exile and arrest He was a dissident during the rule of President Hastings Banda and consequently spent much of the 1970s and 1980s either in detention or in exile. As a trade union leader and pro-democracy activist, Chihana was detained upon his abduction and subsequent return from exile from Kenya in 1970. During his seven-year sentence he was tortured, and spent five years in solitary confinement. A Presbyterian, Chihana was later critical of the church's silence following his detention. However, Amnesty International named him a prisoner of conscience, and was instrumental in his eventual release. He was released in 1977 but continued to protest against one-party rule. At this time, he traveled to England to study at Nuffield College, Oxford. Work with SATUCC  He continued to work with trade unions in southern Africa; in 1985, he became the co-founder and secretary general of the southern African trade union coordinating council. Second exile and arrest In 1992, he returned to Malawi for a democratic conference. There he called Banda's party \\"a party of death and darkness\\" and called for a multiparty system. Following the speech, he was arrested and sentenced to two years imprisonment with hard labor for sedition. However, pressure continued to mount, and Banda agreed to a referendum, held on 17 June 1993, in which one-party rule was decisively rejected. Chinana was released four days before the referendum in part due to US Vice President Al Gore, who had summoned the Malawian ambassador to the White House to protest Chihana's detention and call for the introduction of democracy. Rise of political parties and foundation of AFORD He was the founder and leader of the political movement Alliance for Democracy which became a political party once it became legal to establish political parties in Malawi. Other parties formed then as well including Bakili Muluzi's United Democratic Front (UDF). In the ensuing general election Banda's party, the Malawi Congress Party (MCP), lost power to Bakili Muluzi's United Democratic Front (UDF), with Chihana's new political party, the Alliance for Democracy (AFORD), placed third. Ironically, in spite of Chihana's prominence as the leader of democracy in Malawi, the leader lost elections to the charismatic Bakili Muluzi who had been living outside of the country. Muluzi became the first democratically elected president of Malawi but appointed Chihana as the Second Vice President under his administration. Political career Chihana served as Vice President of Malawi under President Bakili Muluzi from 1994 to 1996 and again from 2003 to 2004. The period saw the political decline of AFORD under his leadership, shrinking to only two seats in the 193-seat parliament by 2006. Chihana also entered into a damaging feud with the Church of Central Africa, warning them to stay out of politics. According to The Guardian, he failed to manage the growing food crisis in the nation during his second term, leading to his resignation. Death He died after a brain tumor operation in Johannesburg, South Africa on 12 June 2006 at the age of 67. He received a state funeral. He is survived by his wife Christina Chihana, son Enoch Chihana, and two daughters, Nina and Tawonga. Awards *Robert F.

Some people believe that if they do exist, it is possible to use market timing to profit from calendar effects. Seasonal patterns are not confined to prices; many other systems can exhibit the same kind of calendar effect. However, the term is most often used in an economic context. Causes Market prices are often subject to seasonal tendencies because the availability and demand for an item is not constant throughout the year. For example, natural gas prices often rise in the winter because that commodity is in demand as a heating fuel. In the summer, when the demand for heat is lower, prices typically fall. Examples Notable calendar effects include: * Sell in May principle (or Halloween indicator) * January effect * January barometer * Mark Twain effect * Weekend effect * July effect * The Congressional Effect * Santa Claus rally * Super Bowl indicator * Lunar effect * United States presidential election cycle Arguments that calendar effects do not exist or are not significant In their 2001 paper Dangers of data mining: The case of calendar effects in stock returns, Ryan Sullivan et al. argue that there is no statistically significant evidence for calendar effects in the stock market, and that all such patterns are the result of data dredging. However there are contradictory findings and there is an ongoing debate on behavioral economics versus rational choice theory. According to the efficient-market hypothesis, the calendar anomalies should not exist because the existence of these anomalies should be already incorporated in the prices of securities. According to Vasileiou, calendar anomalies are significantly influenced by the financial trend, because the investors' psychology depends on the business cycle, and their behavioral change influences not only the market's performance but also the calendar anomalies. According to Vasileiou, calendar anomalies exist but if we examine them using the usually applied definitions, this effect seems to fade.

The phrase was used in 1964 by United States Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart to describe his threshold test for obscenity in Jacobellis v. Ohio. In explaining why the material at issue in the case was not obscene under the Roth test, and therefore was protected speech that could not be censored, Stewart wrote: The expression became one of the best-known phrases in the history of the Supreme Court.Paul Gewirtz, \\"On 'I Know It When I See It'\\", Yale Law Journal, Vol. 105, pp. 1023‚Äì1047 (1996) Though \\"I know it when I see it\\" is widely cited as Stewart's test for \\"obscenity\\", he never used the word \\"obscenity\\" himself in his short concurrence. He only stated that he knows what fits the \\"shorthand description\\" of \\"hard-core pornography\\" when he sees it.378 U.S. at 197 (Stewart, J., concurring) (emphasis added). Stewart's \\"I know it when I see it\\" standard was praised as \\"realistic and gallant\\"Harry Kalven, Jr., A Worthy Tradition: Freedom of Speech in America, p. 40 (1988) and an example of candor.Richard A. Posner, Law and Literature: A Misunderstood Relation p. 308 (1988) It has also been critiqued as being potentially fallacious, due to individualistic arbitrariness. History The Supreme Court of the United States' rulings concerning obscenity in the public square have been unusually inconsistent. Though First Amendment free speech protections have always been taken into account, both Constitutional interpretationalists and originalists have limited this right to account for public sensibilities. Before Roth v. United States in 1957, common law rules stemming from the 1868 English case Regina v. Hicklin have articulated that anything which \\"deprave[s] and corrupt[s] those whose minds are open to such immoral influences\\" was said to be obscene, and therefore banned.Roth v. United States. The Oyez Project at IIT Chicago-Kent College of Law. 8 February 2012. . The Roth case gave a clearer standard for deciding what constitutes pornography, stating that obscenity is material where the \\"dominant theme taken as a whole appeals to the prurient interest\\", and that the \\"average person, applying contemporary community standards\\" would disapprove of, reaffirming the 1913 case United States v. Kennerley. This standard allowed for many works to be called obscene, and though the Roth decision acknowledged \\"all ideas having even the slightest redeeming social importance ... have the full protection of guaranties [sic]\\", the Justices put public sensibility above the protection of individual rights. Jacobellis v. OhioJacobellis v. Ohio. The Oyez Project at IIT Chicago-Kent College of Law. 8 February 2012. . (1964) narrowed the scope of the Roth decision. Justice Potter Stewart, in his concurrence to the majority opinion, created the standard whereby all speech is protected except for \\"hard-core pornography\\". As for what, exactly, constitutes hard-core pornography, Stewart said \\"I shall not today attempt further to define the kinds of material I understand to be embraced within that shorthand description, and perhaps I could never succeed in intelligibly doing so. But I know it when I see it, and the motion picture involved in this case is not that.\\" The film in question was Louis Malle's The Lovers. This was modified in Memoirs v. Massachusetts (1966), in which obscenity was defined as anything patently offensive, appealing to prurient interest, and of no redeeming social value. Still, however, this left the ultimate decision of what constituted obscenity up to the whim of the courts, and did not provide an easily applicable standard for review by the lower courts. This changed in 1973 with Miller v. California. The Miller case established what came to be known as the Miller test, which clearly articulated that three criteria must be met for a work to be legitimately subject to state regulations. The Court recognized the inherent risk in legislating what constitutes obscenity, and necessarily limited the scope of the criteria. The criteria were: #The average person, applying local community standards, looking at the work in its entirety, must find that it appeals to the prurient interest. #The work must describe or depict, in an obviously offensive way, sexual conduct, or excretory functions. #The work as a whole must lack \\"serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific values\\". The third criterion pertains to judgment made by \\"reasonable persons\\" of the United States as a whole, while the first two pertain to that of members of the local community. Due to the larger scope of the third test, it is a more ambiguous criterion than the first two. Regret In 1981 Justice Stewart commented about his second thoughts about coining the phrase. \\"In a way I regret having said what I said about obscenity‚Äîthat's going to be on my tombstone. When I remember all of the other solid words I've written,\\" he said, \\"I regret a little bit that if I'll be remembered at all I'll be remembered for that particular phrase.\\" Al Kamen (December 8, 1985). \\"Retired High Court Justice Potter Stewart Dies at 70\\".

He became well known for being a member of the Canterbury scene progressive rock band Soft Machine. Biography Babbington started his musical career in 1958, playing double bass in local jazz bands. At the age of 17 he took up the post of double bass, doubling on electric guitar (on such numbers as Cliff's 'Move It' on Monday's Rock 'n' Roll evening) with The Leslie Thorp Orchestra at the Aberdeen Beach Ballroom, where he honed his sight reading skills. After moving to London in 1969, he joined the band Delivery, one of the side roots of the Canterbury scene with Phil Miller, Pip Pyle and Lol Coxhill. Also, he began to work as a session musician with jazz/fusion musicians like Michael Gibbs and The Keith Tippett Group (including Elton Dean), appearing on their album Dedicated To You But You Weren't Listening (1970) as well as in Tippett's big band project Centipede (1971) and on Dean's album Just Us. When Delivery disbanded in 1971 after an album with Carol Grimes titled Fools Meeting, Babbington joined Nucleus. He contributed to albums by Alexis Korner, Mike d'Abo, Chris Spedding, folk singers Harvey Andrews and Schunge, and was a part-time member of the bands Solid Gold Cadillac (jazz pianist's Mike Westbrook rock band) and Keith Tippett's Ovary Lodge. With Soft Machine Having already contributed additional double bass parts to electric bassist Hugh Hopper's work on the Soft Machine albums Fourth (1971) and Fifth (1972), he finally replaced Hopper fully in the band with the release of their album Seven. He used a six-string Fender VI throughout his tenure with the band. In addition to Seven, he can be heard on BBC Radio 1971-1974, Bundles, Softs and the library music project Rubber Riff (not actually a Soft Machine recording but featuring its members). Babbington's funk- and rock-oriented electric bass playing went along well with Karl Jenkins' and John Marshall's fusion concept of Soft Machine at the time. After 1976 After leaving Soft Machine, Babbington remained active on the UK jazz scene, playing with Barbara Thompson's Paraphernalia, Joe Gallivan's Intercontinental Express and various bands led by pianist Stan Tracey. In 1979, he appeared on the album Welcome to the Cruise by Judie Tzuke. In the 1980s and 90s, he returned to his roots, double bass and pure jazz, and became affectionately know \\"the jazz handbrake\\". He also worked with Elvis Costello, Carol Grimes, Mose Allison and the BBC Big Band.

It was the second entry in their DR series, following up on the much simpler DR-55. History Boss were better known for producing electric guitar accessories such as effects pedals, and the DR-110 is similarly small and lightweight in size (190√ó110√ó30mm, and only 450g), and like most Boss equipment, could be run from a 9V d.c. supply [negative centre] or batteries. Although not designed as a high-end studio product, The DR-110 nonetheless featured some noticeable advances in technology compared to previous Roland drum machines. It has an LCD graphic display, showing a step-programming grid for the various drum voices. Rubberized touchpads each represent one of the DR-110 voices, and can be used to build a pattern in realtime as well as to enter and edit note data. The DR-110's synthesized drum \\"voices\\" (synthesizer sounds) use analog synthesizer circuits. Tempo is continuously variable between 45 and 300 bpm. The DR-110 used a four-bit Hitachi HD44790A44 CMOS microprocessorhttp://www.synfo.nl/servicemanuals/Boss/BOSS_DR-110_SERVICE_NOTES.pdf and 0,5 KB of ŒºPD444C RAM memory.http://www.pisi.com.pl/piotr433/manuals/upd444.pdf In 1985, Boss released the smaller DR-220 with eleven voices. These devices had much the same functionality as the DR-110, but relied upon digital button-press control of parameters rather than knobs. Drum sounds The DR-110's six synthesized drum voices were: *bass drum *snare drum *open hi hat *closed hi hat *hand clap *cymbal As with most previous Roland drum machines, the bass and snare voices are generated by a \\"damped tuned resonance\\" oscillators. The cymbals and hi-hats are created by VCA-shaping and band-pass filtering a combination of white noise and four non-harmonically related square wave oscillators (generating a much more realistic sound than white noise alone). The clap sound uses only shaped white noise, but was triggered by a multiple pulse train, to create a reverberation effect. No tonal variation of the voices is possible; however (as with several earlier Roland drum machines), the relative balance is variable between the bass and snare drums versus the hi-hat and cymbal. An accent (volume increase) can also be added on any pattern step; the amount of accent is globally variable with a knob. Rhythm patterns The DR-110 offers 16 preset patterns, and 16 memory locations for the user-created patterns. Each pattern can be divided into 16 or 12 steps. The DR-110 also has two \\"song\\" memories, each of which allows chaining of up to 128 bars of patterns. A small battery retains memory content when the DR-110 was switched off. Interfacing A \\"V-trig\\" clock pulse (+6V, 10ms duration) can be used, via a 3.5mm mini-jack, to allow other \\"slave\\" synthesizer units (e.g. arpeggiators) to synchronize to the DR-110 accent section. The DR-110 has a 10kŒ© impedance unbalanced mono audio output, available on a ¬º\\" phone connector socket. This output can be plugged into a keyboard amplifier or PA system. The socket is also configured as the \\"Roland P-bus,\\" which meant it can be used as a simultaneous audio input, the input source being mixed with the output signal. A separate 3.5mm headphone output socket is also present. The DR-110 does not offer any kind of external \\"sync\\", but can be fitted with third-party DIN-sync interfaces available from other companies.http://www.circuitbenders.co.uk/forsale/DR110sync.html circuitbenders.co.ukhttp://www.acidlab.de/ acidlabs Internally, the DR110 runs at 12ppqn (pulses per quarter note), so extra circuitry is needed to interface it with the Roland DIN-sync standard of 24ppqn. To access the Test Mode function, users press and hold both the Start and Stop buttons when turning on the unit. The entire LED screen shows. The user presses the blue buttons one at the time, a big \\"OK\\" appears in the programming grid after last button. The user turns the unit off and then on to exit test mode and go back to normal mode.

This theory has caused debate among scholars, several of whom have dismissed it. For example, K. S. Shukla asserts that Pingree's argument depends on incorrect emendations to the manuscript of the Yavanajataka. Bill Mak, a historian of astronomy, finds that Pingree's dating of both the original manuscript by Yavane≈õvara (149/150CE) and the alleged translation by Sphujidhvaja (269/270CE) are incorrect, and that in fact both the author and translator are the same individual.Bill Mak (Kyoto University), The transmission of Greek astral science to India reconsidered - Critical remarks on the contents and the newly discovered manuscript of the YavanajƒÅtaka. Institute for Research in Humanities, 2012.10.27.http://www.billmak.com/category/astronomy/indian-astronomy/page/2/ The French historian of astronomy Roger Billard in his book Astronomie Indienne (1975) dismisses Pingree's theory that Indian astronomical tables were derived from Babylonia by showing that this theory was in conflict with internal evidence in the Indian texts. Career Jon McGinnis of the University of Missouri, St. Louis, describes Pingree's life-work thus: > ... Pingree devoted himself to the study of the exact sciences, such as > mathematics, mathematical astronomy and astral omens. He was also acutely > interested in the transmission of those sciences across cultural and > linguistic boundaries. His interest in the transmission of the exact > sciences came from two fronts or, perhaps more correctly, his interest > represents two sides of the same coin.

On the other hand, Pingree was also > interested in how scientific texts surviving from a later culture might be > used to reconstruct or cast light on our fragmentary records of earlier > sciences.

The surnames McCabe and MacCabe are Irish and Scottish surnames. They are Anglicisations of the Gaelic Mac C√°ba, a patronymic name meaning \\"son of C√°ba\\". The nickname or personal name C√°ba is of uncertain origin. The surname can be written in modern Scottish Gaelic as MacC√†ba and MacCaibe. Patrick Woulfe considered that the surname was possibly derived from a nickname, meaning \\"a cap\\", or \\"hood\\". Henry Harrison suggested the name was from the Gaelic Mac Aba, meaning \\"son of the Abbot\\". If Harrison is to be believed then the surname would have a similar etymology as the surnames MacNab, McNab, which are from the Gaelic Mac an Aba, Mac an Abadh. Bearers of the surname are considered to have settled in Ireland from the Western Isles of Scotland sometime around 1350, employed as gallowglass (mercenary soldiers) to the O'Reillys and O'Rourkes which were the principal septs of Breffny. According to a pedigree written by Dubhaltach Mac Fhirbhisigh, the MacCabes descend from the MacLeods and king Sitric Silkenbeard. In time the MacCabes became a recognised Irish sept, with the chieftain being called \\"Constable of the two Breffnys\\". According to MacLysaght in the mid 20th century, statistics then showed that the surname was more numerous in the Breffny area than anywhere else. MacCabe landowners are however more associated with Co Monaghan and Co Cavan; however the principal families of the name lost all their estates after the Battle of Aughrim in 1691. According to a genealogy which purports to date from the 17th century, Alexander MacCabe (fl.1689) was a descendant of the last chieftains of the MacCabes. Within the genealogy, his arms are blazoned: vert a fesse wavy between three salmons naiant argent; crest a demi-griffon segreant; motto aut vincere aut mori. In the 1990 United States Census the surname McCabe was ranked 1,200th most common surname, and MacCabe was ranked 43,031st.

He helped establish the American Historical Association. Early life A Yankee, Jameson was born in Somerville, Massachusetts, the son of John Jameson, a schoolteacher, lawyer, and postmaster, and Mariette Thompson. He graduated from Amherst College in 1879 as class valedictorian, studying with John W. Burgess and Anson D. Morse. More influential was Herbert Baxter Adams, head of the department of history and political science at the Johns Hopkins University, where Jameson received the first doctorate in history in 1882. He became an instructor; his dissertation The Origin and Development of the Municipal Government of New York City was published in article form in 1882. He moved to Brown University as professor in 1888. One of his judgments has since gained currency as a proverbial saying. In The History of Historical Writing in America (Boston: Houghton Mifflin and Company, 1891), Jameson remarked that the third volume of George Bancroft's History of the United States, like the first two, \\"continued to vote for Jackson.\\" Subsequent versions of this saying‚Äîe.g., that \\"every page of Bancroft's history votes for Jackson\\"‚Äîmay be traced to this phrasing.Marcus DeWolfe Howe, The Life and Letters of George Bancroft 2 vols, New York: Charles Scribner and Sons, 1908, I, pp. 237. Gatekeeper Jameson was a social historian, an expert in historiography, and above all an intellectual entrepreneur and gatekeeper who helped determine the priorities of the history profession in America. His base was the American Historical Association, which he helped found in 1884. He chaired its Historical Manuscripts Commission in 1895 and became the first managing editor of the American Historical Review (AHR), 1895‚Äì1901, 1905‚Äì1928, serving as information central for academic historiography. After an interlude at the University of Chicago he went to Washington in 1905 as director of the Department of Historical Research of the heavily endowed Carnegie Institution of Washington. At the Carnegie Institution, Jameson found that decisions were largely in the hand of scientists and businessmen. He had some difficulty in conveying the importance to work on American history of archival research and bibliography. He held his position there until 1928. He was not known for his writings, but his small book on The American Revolution Considered as a Social Movement (1926) proved influential. It expressed themes Jameson had been developing since the 1890s which reflected the \\"Progressive\\" historiography. It downplayed ideas and political values and stressed the Revolution was a fight over power among economic interest groups, especially who would rule at home. In 1890, Jameson was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society.American Antiquarian Society Members Directory American Historical Association Jameson was the first professional historian to become the AHA president (1907). Although a number of Jameson's colleagues and friends went on to serve as AHA presidents, they also tended to refer to Jameson as \\"the Dean,\\" a jocose reference to his influence within the organization. Jameson invited W.E.B. Du Bois to present a paper concerning Reconstruction at the 1909 AHA meeting, which proved controversial; no other African-American was invited to speak before the AHA until 1940.Lewis, David Levering, W.E.B. Du Bois: A Biography (2009: Henry Holt and Co.) at pp. 250‚Äì252 Single volume edition, updated, of his 1994 and 2001 works. . At that time, the AHA used a system of electing a Second Vice President who ascended to the Presidency of the organization over the subsequent two years. Trouble arose in the AHA as younger men protested Jameson's authoritarianism. In 1913‚Äì1915 the insurgents, led by Frederic Bancroft, accused Jameson and an inner circle of notable historians of the time (including Frederick Jackson Turner, Andrew C. McLaughlin, George Lincoln Burr, and Charles Homer Haskins) of being undemocratic, and published a pamphlet attacking both the system of governance and the individuals. A compromise was offered by Jameson's co-editor of the AHR and incoming President, George Lincoln Burr, who refused to take office unless he were elected by the membership directly. As a result, the insurgents gained some new, more democratic rules, including the direct annual election of the President, and Burr was unanimously elected President of the AHA. Although the controversy was resolved, Jameson's reputation suffered some collateral damage. R. R. Palmer, \\"Presidential Address,\\" American Historical Review 76:1 (February 1971): 1‚Äì15 Carnegie Institution and Library of Congress During World War I Jameson edited historical material for soldiers in their training camps, and he published articles in the AHR that supported the Allies. In 1918, he was one of two scholars who pronounced on the authenticity of the Sisson Documents that purported to demonstrate that Germany had financed the Bolshevik Revolution. Decades later George F. Kennan demonstrated the documents were forgeries and denounced Jameson for his participation despite his lack of qualifications, notably no knowledge of Russian. At Carnegie Jameson supervised a series of documentary publications, such as guides to archival resources around the world, documentary editions of the letters of members of the Continental Congress, documents on the slave trade and slave law, and the papers of Andrew Jackson, as well as an atlas of American history. Jameson began numerous annual publications and, with Waldo Leland, started lobbying Congress to create the National Archives, the building for which was first funded in 1926. The National Archives organization was established in 1934. In 1926 he finally published an influential short book in the works for three decades, The American Revolution Considered as a Social Movement. After losing his position at Carnegie in 1928, he became head of the Division of Manuscripts at the Library of Congress, where he made some notable acquisitions of major collections. Jameson himself explained his life's work in this way: :\\"I struggle on making bricks without much idea of how the architects will use them, but believing that the best architect that ever was cannot get along without bricks, and therefore trying to make good ones.\\"John Higham, History: Professional Scholarship in America (1989) pp. 24‚Äì25. Honors and tributes The Library of Congress and the American Historical Association offer the J.

The K2000 features a complex digital synthesis architecture dubbed V.A.S.T., which stands for \\"Variable Architecture Synthesis Technology\\", Kurzweil's marketing term for the digital signal processing (DSP) sound processing system used in the K2000 and other members of its K2xxx series. Variable Architecture Synthesis Technology (V.A.S.T.)=Summary V.A.S.T. stands for variable-architecture synthesis technology. It is variable in that the user can select different signal paths, which contain different DSP functions, for use in creating and shaping a sound. V.A.S.T. also includes an extensive modulation system, similar in concept to that of analog modular synthesizers. A wide array of modulation sources can be assigned to various parameters within a signal path, and modulation sources can be combined to create new modulation sources. Details The basic component of a V.A.S.T. program is a \\"layer\\". A layer on the K2000 contains a single \\"algorithm\\", which contains up to four slots for user-assignable DSP functions. The algorithm assigned to a layer is preceded by several other functions, or \\"blocks\\". There is the \\"keymap\\" block, which determines which (if any) samples are assigned to the keyboard in the layer. This is succeeded by the \\"pitch\\" block, which determines how the \\"keymap\\" is pitched across the keyboard. Following the \\"algorithm\\" section is an amplifier block (and a dedicated multi-mode envelope to modulate the gain of the sound over time) and, finally, an \\"output\\" block that determines which group of outputs (there are four output groups on the rack version, two on the keyboard version) the sound is assigned to and how it is panned between the two outputs in a stereo group. In essence, therefore, we have: > [keymap] - [pitch] - [algorithm] - [amp] - [output] Up to 32 layers can make up a \\"program\\", similar to a \\"patch\\" on other synthesizers. [N.B.: 32 layers are possible on the K2500 (24 on the K2000 series) as \\"Drum Programs\\" (using any types of patches, not just drums), and may be used on 8 consecutive MIDI channels. The PC3 and K2600 series allow 32 layers on all channels.] Within a program, each layer can have independent settings in all of the various blocks, including different algorithms, pan positions, output mappings, etc. Modulation sources can be routed to almost all of these, and can be independently assigned within a layer and between layers. Thus using a particular modulation source in one \\"block\\" does not exclude it from being used elsewhere (for instance you could assign keystroke velocity to control, say, filter frequency cutoff and resonance in one layer, while in another it can be assigned to control pitch or pan position) . There are 31 algorithms available in the K2000, the allowed DSP functions for each algorithm are detailed in section 26 of the K2000 user manual. For example, algorithm 9 can be configured as follows: > [SAW]-[SW+SHP]-[LP2RES]-[AMP] Adding this to the basic patch layout shown above gives: > [keymap] - [pitch] - [SAW] - [SW+SHP] - [LP2RES] - [AMP] - [amp] - [output] The DSP functions are described in detail in section 14 of the K2000 user manual. In this particular example, the sample mapped to the keyboard via the keymap block does not sound; instead a sawtooth wave will be combined with another sawtooth wave and fed through the \\"shaper\\" (which, in essence, allows one wave to frequency modulate another), then through a 2-pole lowpass filter with a fixed resonance, and finally through two gain stages to the output. At each point in the pipeline there are parameters that can be modulated by control sources. These parameters vary depending on which \\"block\\" is being modulated. For instance, for the [SAW] DSP block the user can assign various modulations sources to modulate the pitch of the sawtooth wave. There are, generally speaking, three sources that can be assigned to modulate a parameter. In the case of the [SAW] DSP block, the user can specify a starting pitch and determine how the pitch will track across the keyboard by specifying the amount of modulation supplied by each key in cents (via \\"Keytrk\\", or key track). The user can also assign modulation sources to \\"Src1\\" and \\"Src2\\" and specify the depth of the modulation amount (for \\"Src1\\", the user can specify \\"Depth\\". for \\"Src2\\", \\"MinDpt\\" and \\"MaxDpt\\"). Additionally, \\"Src2\\" has a \\"Dptctl\\" (depth control) parameter‚Äîa control source that will determine how much the control source assigned to \\"Src2\\" will modulate the parameter. For example, a user may assign a key tracking value of 100 cents (causing a keyboard controller to play a 12-tone Western scale), assign \\"Src1\\" to a knob on a MIDI controller with a \\"Depth\\" value of 1200 cents (to tune the whole keyboard up or down by an octave), and assign \\"Src2\\" to be modulated by \\"LFO1\\". Further, the \\"MinDpt\\" and \\"MaxDpt\\" can be set to -100 cents and 100 cents respectively, and the \\"Dptctrl\\" can be assigned to another knob on a MIDI controller. This would provide a \\"vibrato\\" effect whose speed is controlled by \\"LFO1\\" (or low-frequency oscillator) and whose depth is controlled by the assigned MIDI control. Some DSP blocks take up two or three slots, and each of those slots represents a value that can be modulated using one of the assignable control sources. For instance, the \\"4POLE LOPASS W/ SEP\\" (actually two 2-pole lowpass filters which can operate in unison or at different frequencies) DSP block takes up 3 slots. The first is used to set the frequency for the filter, the second to set the resonance, and the third to set the \\"separation\\" between the two 2-pole filters. Just as in the case of the [SAW] DSP block, each of those parameters can be modulated by three control sources. A discussion of V.A.S.T. would not be complete without mentioning \\"FUNs\\". \\"FUN\\" stands for \\"function\\", and these are mathematical equations that take two values (a and b) as inputs and perform an operation on them. FUN equations include \\"a+b\\", \\"a*b\\", \\"b/(1-a)\\", and many others of varying complexity. They also allow for self-modulation; some FUNs introduce a variable \\"y\\" which represents the most recent output of the FUN. The Kurzweil evaluates each FUN every 20 milliseconds, hence it can take that value and plug it back into the equation if the equation has \\"y\\" as an input variable. Any modulation source can be assigned to a or b (or both at the same time) in a FUN. This can be used to mix two modulation sources, cause one to multiply the effects of another, and so forth. Internally, the K2000 rescales whatever value is currently being sent by the control source to a number between -1 and 1 (for bipolar control sources. Unipolar sources are scaled between 0 and 1), then applies the function and returns an output value. Using FUNS, therefore, more than three control sources can be assigned to modulate a parameter in a block since you can assign a FUN as a modulation source for \\"Src1\\", \\"Src2\\", or \\"Dptctl\\". Four FUNs are available per layer and FUNs can be assigned as inputs to other FUNs. The Kurzweil evaluates the FUNs sequentially, hence for this to work you would want to assign FUN1 as an input to FUN2, but not vice versa. A program can be set to run in \\"global\\" mode as well. In this mode, certain modulation sources can affect all layers in a program instead of just affecting the current layer. Among other effects, in \\"global\\" mode the global LFO will always be running, instead of starting when a key is pressed. The behavior of other global modulation sources may also change in this mode. V.A.S.T. includes a number of control sources. There are two LFOs (\\"LFO1\\" and \\"LFO2\\") with a user-assignable wave shape and frequency modulation source. \\"AMPENV\\" is the main ADSR (attack-decay-sustain-release) control source for the final amplifier in a layer and has multiple attack, decay, and release segments. \\"ENV1\\" and \\"ENV2\\" are bipolar envelopes, and \\"ASR1\\" and \\"ASR2\\" are two more unipolar envelopes. All of these can be set to loop for a fixed or infinite number of cycles, and the loop start and end points can be set to different stages of the envelopes. Also include are several random-number generators, clocks based on the internal or external MIDI master clock, key and note state, mono and polyphonic aftertouch, etc. A complete list of these can be found in section 25 of the K2000 user manual.

The waterpark had operated under numerous names in the past, including Lake Dolores, Rock‚ÄìA‚ÄìHoola Waterpark, and Discovery Waterpark. 1950s through 1980s The park was originally designed and built by local businessman Bob Byers for use by his extended family. Lake Dolores was named after Byers' wife. The initial phases of conception, planning and construction took place in the late 1950s and early 1960s. An expanse of arid land on the eastern edge of the Mojave Desert from Interstate 15 was chosen for the project. The area contains underground springs fed by the Mojave Aquifer. Lake Dolores, the body of water, is a man-made lake fed by underground springs. In May 1962 a basic campground adjacent to the small lake was opened to the public. Enthusiasts of motocross and people traveling on Interstate 15 between Los Angeles and Las Vegas gave the campground some business. Over the next 25 years, rides and attractions were added, and the site evolved into a waterpark, which was advertised on television with the slogan \\"The Fun Spot of The Desert!\\" The park featured eight identical sixty‚Äìdegree‚Äìangle steel waterslides mounted side by side on a man‚Äìmade hill. Riders rode on small plastic \\"floaties\\" which skimmed across the lagoon when they hit the water at the slide's end. Nearby were two V‚Äìshaped waterslides, also roughly long, which were ridden standing up. The slides ended about above the water, shooting the standing rider out of the end like a human cannonball. On the \\"Zip‚ÄìCord\\" ride, riders hung from a hand‚Äìheld device attached to a guide wire for approximately at a 30‚Äìdegree downward angle. At the end of this wire the hand‚Äìgrip would slam into a blocking mechanism and come to a stop about above the water, with the momentum thrusting the hanging rider forward into the lagoon. In the middle of a smaller adjacent lake were three high diving boards, and three trapeze-like swings hanging from an A‚Äìframe structure mounted on a high platform. Riders launched themselves from these swings into the lake. The \\"Big Bopper\\" was a fast, long group raft ride. The \\"Lazy River\\" was a slower and more relaxed raft ride. There were also bumper boats, an oval JetSki water racetrack, and a swimming pool. The park saw its peak attendance between the early 1970s and the mid-1980s. After a downturn in popularity in the late 1980s, the park closed. 1990 through 2004=Rock‚ÄìA‚ÄìHoola Waterpark Byers sold the defunct park in August 1990 to Lake Dolores Group LLC, a three‚Äìmember investment group led by Oxnard, California businessman Terry Christensen, who envisioned a more polished park with a 1950s theme. In 1995, the original waterslides on the hill were removed to make room for new installations. Advertising and promotion was contracted to Beachport Entertainment Corporation, and the park reopened under a new name, \\"Rock‚ÄìA‚ÄìHoola\\", on July 4, 1998. The new park featured the constant playing of 1950s and 1960s rock and roll music throughout the park along with some compatible graphics. In its \\"Rock‚ÄìA‚ÄìHoola\\" incarnation, the park included a river ride on inflated tubes. On June 26, 1999, Insomniac Events held the annual Electric Daisy Carnival (EDC), an all-night rave, at Lake Dolores Waterpark. An on‚Äìpremises RV park had been planned but its opening was delayed. In its three seasons the park amassed three million dollars in debt, one of the three investors experienced financial problems, and an employee crippled in a 1999 accident was awarded $4.4 million in damages (affirmed by the California Fourth District Court of Appeal in 2004). The park filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in February 2000. The court‚Äìappointed trustee failed to find a buyer, and in August 2000 the bankruptcy filing was changed to Chapter 7 liquidation. The bankruptcy judge overseeing the case returned the property to Dolores Byers (husband Bob Byers died in 1996) with most debts discharged. Dolores Byers sold the property in September 2001 to S.L. Investment Group LLC of the City of Industry, California. She died a month later. Discovery Waterpark After a US$400,000 renovation the waterpark reopened in May 2002 under a new name: Discovery Waterpark. In 2002 and 2003, the park was open on weekends.

In 2003, Olympic Gold Medalist and former professional football player Ron Brown and the Pro Players Network, a group of former and current professional athletes, formulated a proposal to purchase the park and turn it into a camp for disadvantaged youths, but this effort failed. Some of the park installations were sold off. The \\"Big Bopper\\" waterslide was dismantled and shipped to Canada. It became \\"Colossal Canyon\\" at Cultus Lake Waterpark near Vancouver, British Columbia. Repeatedly vandalized, the park fell into ruins. Much of the park was torn apart by people who salvaged metal and wires from the buildings. Urban explorers frequently visited the waterpark, ignoring the \\"no trespassing signs. In March 2008 the park appeared in an episode of the reality show Rob & Big on MTV. Professional skateboarder Rob Dyrdek and friends used the waterpark and its slides to perform skateboard stunts for the show. In 2011, a group called Oasis Themepark announced a project to renovate and reopen the park, but this effort failed. cited at In June 2012, another skate film Kilian Martin: Altered Route directed by Brett Novak and sponsored in part by Mercedes-Benz showed the park in its current state while reflecting on its past appearance. In 2013, TrustoCorp, a group of artists from New York City, transformed the park into a \\"TrustoLand\\" as an artistic statement, by repainting many signs and buildings with unusual images and messages. On May 27, 2013, Boards of Canada publicly debuted their album Tomorrow's Harvest by playing it first at Lake Dolores Waterpark. They had previously hinted that it would be played there by tweeting satellite images and uploading a video to YouTube featuring a distorted advertisement for the park titled Look Sad Reel, an anagram of Lake Dolores.

Since the 2011 local government reform it is part of the municipality Sintiki, of which it is the seat and a municipal unit.Kallikratis law Greece Ministry of Interior It is built near the fertile valley of the river Strymonas, on the bank of the Krousovitis River. Sidirokastro is situated on the European route E79 and the main road from northern Greece (Thessaloniki) to Bulgaria. It has a number of tourist sights, such as the medieval stone castle, Byzantine ruins, and natural spas. General information View of the town, 1919 Theotokos church Hotel Olympic A bust of Anastasios Polyzoidis Sidirokastro is located 25 km to the northwest of the town of Serres, between the Vrontous and Angistro mountains (to the north) and the river Strymonas (to the west). The 2011 census recorded 9,294 residents in the municipal unit of Sidirokastro, while there were 5,693 residents recorded in the community of Sidirokastro and 5,177 in the settlement. The municipal unit has an area of 196.554 km2. The town is crossed by the Krousovitis River, one of the Strymonas' tributaries, which divides the town into two sections. These sections are connected by two bridges: Stavrou and Kalkani. The landscape is made even prettier thanks to the Maimouda rivulet and its miniature bridges. Sidirokastro's population is a blend of indigenous people and descendants of the early 20th century waves of refugees from Asia Minor (people who sought asylum in Greece from the wars and conflicts of that period). Sidirokastro took in refugees from Melnik in 1913; from East Thrace (European Turkey) after the 1922 onslaught that followed the Greco-Turkish Wars in Asia Minor; from Pontus, Vlachs and people from all over Greece. History Sidirokastro's history reaches a long way back in time. There are Palaeolithic ruins here, and references to the area are found in Homer and Herodotus. Its ancient inhabitants migrated to Sidirokastro from the island of Limnos. The area's first inhabitants were of the Sintian tribe, after which Sintiki Province is named. D. C. Samsaris, Historical Geography of Eastern Macedonia during the Antiquity (in Greek), Thessaloniki 1976 (Society for Macedonian Studies), p. 56-57, 93-94, 120-125. . According to the statistics of Geographers Dimitri Mishev and D.M. Brancoff, the town had a total Christian population of 1.535 people in 1905, consisting of 864 Bulgarian Patriarchist Grecomans, 245 Greek Christians, 240 Vlachs, 162 Roma people and 24 Exarchist Bulgarians.Dimitri Mishev and D. M. Brancoff, La Mac√©doine et sa Population Chr√©tienne, p. 188 On September 20, 1383, Sidirokastro was overtaken by Ottoman forces and remained under their rule for 529 years. Its name was changed to \\"Demir Hisar\\" (Also called \\"Timurhisar\\"). Demirhisar was a kaza centre in the Sanjak of Serres before the Balkan Wars. In 1912, Sidirokastro was captured by the Bulgarians under general Georgi Todorov, but some months later it came under Greek control when the Balkan Wars ended. In 1915, during World War I, it came under the control of the Central Powers (Especially Bulgarians), but it remained part of the Greek state when the war ended (1918). In April 1941, after the surrender of the Roupel fortress and the German army's invasion of Greece, the Bulgarian army occupied Sidirokastro, as part of the triple Axis Occupation of Greece. The Bulgarians left in 1944 with the rest of the retreating Axis powers.

M. Barrie, as well as in most adaptations in other media. Her exact age is not specified in the original play or novel by Barrie, though it is implied that she is about 12 years old or possibly younger, as she is \\"just Peter's size\\". As a girl on the verge of adulthood, she stands in contrast to Peter Pan, a boy who refuses to grow up, the major theme of the Peter Pan stories. Wendy hesitates at first to fly off to Neverland, but she comes to enjoy her adventures. Ultimately, she chooses to go back to her parents and accepts that she has to grow up.  Background  In the novel Peter Pan, and its cinematic adaptations, she is an Edwardian schoolgirl. The novel states that she attends a \\"kindergarten school\\" with her younger brothers, meaning a school for pre- adolescent children. Like Peter, in many adaptations of the story she is shown to be on the brink of adolescence. She belongs to a middle class London household of that era, and is the daughter of George Darling, a short-tempered and pompous bank/office worker, and his wife, Mary. Wendy shares a nursery room with her two brothers, Michael and John. However, in the Disney version, her father decides that \\"it's high time she had a room of her own\\" and kicks her out of the nursery for \\"stuffing the boys' heads with a lot of silly stories\\", but changes his mind at the end of the film after he returns home with his wife after the party.  Character  Wendy is the most developed character in the story of Peter Pan, and is considered a main protagonist. She is proud of her own childhood and enjoys telling stories and fantasising. She has a distaste for adulthood, acquired partly by the example of it set by her father, whom she loves but fears due to his somewhat violent fits of anger. Her ambition early in the story is to somehow avoid growing up. She is granted this opportunity by Peter Pan, who takes her and her brothers to Neverland, where they can remain young forever. Wendy finds that this experience brings out her more adult side. Peter and the tribe of Lost Boys who dwell in Neverland want her to be their \\"mother\\" (a role they remember only vaguely), a request she tentatively accedes to, performing various domestic tasks for them. There is also a degree of innocent flirtation with Peter which incites jealousy in Peter's fairy Tinker Bell. In Barrie's book Peter and Wendy, Wendy asks Peter at the end if he would like to speak to her parents about \\"a very sweet subject\\", implying that she would like him to speak to her parents about someday marrying her. Wendy eventually learns that adulthood has its rewards and returns to London, deciding not to postpone maturity any longer. Barrie's short play When Wendy Grew Up ‚Äì An Afterthought was first staged in 1908, and the story line included in the novel published in 1911. It was published in 1957 and sometimes incorporated into productions of the play. In this Afterthought Wendy has grown up and married, although it's not known whom she married, and has a daughter, Jane. When Peter returns looking for Wendy, he does not understand at first that Wendy is no longer a young girl, as he has no notion of time when in Neverland. He meets Jane and invites her to fly off with him to Neverland. Wendy lets her daughter go, trusting her to make the same choices as her. The narrator states that Jane has a daughter, Margaret, who will one day also go to Neverland with Peter Pan, and \\"in this way, it will go on for ever and ever, so long as children are young and innocent\\".Barrie, J.M. When Wendy Grew Up ‚Äì An Afterthought, Nelson, 1957.  Physical appearance  Barrie does not give any description of Wendy, but she is generally depicted as a pretty girl with blond or brown hair. While Tiger Lily and Tinker Bell are usually portrayed as exotic or magical figures, Wendy represents the conventional young mother figure who ultimately captures Peter Pan's attention. Wendy is portrayed in the Disney movie with light brown hair, wearing a blue nightdress and blue ribbon in her hair.  Relationships  In the original novel and the 1953 Disney movie, Wendy has an easy relationship with her mother, Mary Darling. Her relationship with her father, George Darling, is more difficult as he is always serious and does not like Wendy telling stories to her brothers that he considers childish, threatening to move Wendy to her own room. However, Wendy and her father do love each other and when Wendy comes back from Neverland, she seems to have a better understanding of her father. Wendy and her brothers, John Darling and Michael Darling, to whom she tells stories, have a good relationship. She shows great concern for them and is very protective towards them. In the 1953 cartoon movie, she makes John and Michael realize that they need their real mother and persuades them to return home after their adventures in Neverland. Wendy believes in Peter Pan and shares his stories with her brothers every night. When Wendy and Peter meet for the first time, she begins to care about him too. Romantic feelings between them are hinted at, but never articulated. In the 2003 film, the feeling is mutual and Wendy shows her love when she gives Peter a hidden kiss in order to save him from Captain Hook. They also have a special moment in the cartoon sequel to the 1953 film, Return to Neverland, when Peter and a grown up Wendy are reunited for the first time in years and they say goodbye for the final time. In Hook, an older Wendy hints she still has feelings for Peter (who has grown up and married her granddaughter, Moira).  The name Wendy  The first name Wendy was very uncommon in the English-speaking world before J. M. Barrie's work and its subsequent popularity has led some to credit him with \\"inventing\\" it. Although the name Wendy was used to a limited extent as the familiar-form of the Welsh name Gwendolyn, it is thought that Barrie took the name from a phrase used by Margaret Henley, a five-year-old girl whom Barrie befriended in the 1890s, daughter of his friend William Henley.Birkin, Andrew. J. M. Barrie and the Lost Boys, Yale University Press, 2003. She called Barrie her \\"friendy-wendy\\", which she pronounced as \\"fwendy-wendy\\". She died at the age of five and was buried, along with her family, in Cockayne Hatley. In Great Britain, South Africa, New Zealand and Australia, children's playhouses are commonly known as Wendy houses.  In popular culture = On stage  In the first productions of the play at the Duke of York's theatre in London, from 1904 to 1909, she was portrayed by Hilda Trevelyan and at the first US production at the Empire Theatre in New York in 1905, by Mildred Morris.Hanson, Bruce. Peter Pan on Stage and Screen, 1904‚Äì2010. McFarland (2011)  In film  Disney's Peter Pan. = Live-action = * Peter Pan (1924 silent live-action film) ‚Äì Mary Brian. The actress was 18, but publicity materials claimed she was 16. * Hook (1991 live-action film) ‚Äì Dame Maggie Smith plays an elderly Wendy, who is being honoured for her lifetime of work in finding homes for orphans. She was also a former neighbour of J. M. Barrie, who loved Wendy's stories to her siblings and wrote them in books. Her granddaughter Moira is the wife of Peter Banning (Robin Williams), the former Peter Pan who has grown up and forgotten his life in Neverland. During a flashback to Peter's childhood, a younger Wendy is played by Gwyneth Paltrow. (Peter and Moira's daughter, Wendy's great-granddaughter, is Maggie, a common pet name for Margaret, the name of Jane's daughter, Wendy's granddaughter, in the original book by Barrie.) During the movie, it is implied that Wendy once and still does have feelings for the now-grown-up Peter. * Peter Pan (2003 live-action film) ‚Äì Rachel Hurd- Wood. In this film, as in Barrie's original treatment, Wendy easily falls into a mothering role with her male companions, but is conflicted by her romantic feelings towards Peter, who reacts with incomprehension and annoyance. She is also more adventurous than in most adaptations, taking part in the conflict with the pirates including sword fighting. The film also develops Barrie's hint that Wendy is attracted to the more mature and virile Hook, showing that she is growing up in spite of herself. * Peter Pan and Wendy - Ever Anderson, daughter of film director Paul W. S. Anderson and actress will play Wendy in the upcoming live action Disney movie. = Animation = * Peter Pan (1953 animated film) ‚Äì Kathryn Beaumont. Disney's Wendy is portrayed as being a mother first and foremost, with all the classical ideas of how to be a mother and care for people. She appears bossy but well-meaning, and slightly taken with Peter. Like her original character in the novel, she cares about Peter and about her brothers' well-being. She also appears at the Walt Disney Parks and Resorts as a meetable character in Fantasyland. * Return to Never Land (2002 animated film) ‚Äì Kath Soucie voices a grown-up Wendy who has married a man named Edward and has raised her children on tales of Peter Pan. Her role is minimal in this portrayal, but at the end of the film she is briefly, but happily, reunited with Peter after several years when he brings her daughter Jane home, Wendy assuring Peter that she hasn't changed where it matters and having a brief flight thanks to Tinker Bell. * Tinker Bell (2008 animated film) ‚Äì America Young. In Tinker Bell, Wendy was the baby from which Tinker Bell came. Wendy is shown as the recipient of a long-forgotten ballerina music box that Tinker Bell has repaired. Wendy is much younger in appearance than in 1953's Peter Pan.  In television  Live-action = * In the first two telecasts of the 1954 Broadway musical version of the play (1955 and 1956), Wendy was portrayed by Kathleen Nolan, who had also played her onstage. In the 1960 telecast of the musical, Ms. Nolan was replaced by Maureen Bailey, whose only major television role this was. In the 2014 telecast, Peter Pan Live!, Wendy was played by Taylor Louderman. * In the 1976 musical version in which Mia Farrow played Peter, Wendy was played by Briony McRoberts. * Wendy was a recurring character in the second and third season of Once Upon a Time, portrayed by Freya Tingley. In the series, she was born in the late nineteenth century in the Land Without Magic, but spent over a hundred years in Neverland as Pan‚Äôs prisoner, a fate from which she was freed by the show‚Äôs heroes. * In ITV's 2015 film Peter & Wendy, Wendy is played by Hazel Doupe. = Animation = * A black-haired Wendy was portrayed by Christina Lange in Fox's Peter Pan and the Pirates without a British accent and wearing a crown of flowers in her short hair. * The Disney version of Wendy was featured as one of the guests in House of Mouse; however, despite the fact that Kathryn Beaumont was credited as providing Wendy's voice, Wendy said nothing. * The Disney version of Wendy is featured in a special episode in Jake and the Never Land Pirates, voiced by Maia Mitchell. *Wendy Darling appeared as an adult in the second season of World of Winx as head of an orphanage in London, England. She was tracked down the Winx Club, who told her that they needed to find Peter Pan. Although she was unaware of his whereabouts since he had left her, she gave the six fairies a letter that revealed that he had a son named Matt.  In literature  * In the Peter and the Starcatchers series, Wendy Darling is the daughter of Molly Aster, whom Peter has encountered while first discovering Neverland.  In anime and manga  * In the anime series Peter Pan no Boken (Adventures of Peter Pan), which is a part of the World Masterpiece Theater, a rather tomboyish Wendy has a pivotal role in the second part of the series, which depicts a completely original story where Peter Pan, the Lost Kids and the Darling siblings must save a young witch named Luna from the clutches of her evil grandmother, the witch Sinistra, and Wendy is the one who truly saves her. She is also shown directly antagonizing Captain Hook when he kidnaps her in the first part, yelling at him and even impersonating his mother at some point to manipulate his fears against him.  In music  * The Wendy Trilogy, a feminist-minded retelling of the Peter Pan story as a three-song cycle, shows Wendy accepting, rather than refusing, Captain Hook's offer to make her a pirate, and subsequently becoming mistress of the Jolly Roger. * Somewhere in Neverland, a song by the American rock band All Time Low where she and Peter Pan are used as metaphors for the song's narrator not wanting to grow up.  In video games  * The Disney version of Wendy is featured in the video-game Kingdom Hearts. In the game, Captain Hook believes she is a princess of Heart and is displeased when it turns out she is not.  In comic and graphic novel  * In Alan Moore and Melinda Gebbie's adult graphic novel Lost Girls, first published in full in 2006, Wendy is re- imagined as a middle-aged woman who (in an encounter with Oz's Dorothy and Wonderland's Alice) recounts her sexual encounters with a local homeless boy who represents the \\"real\\" Peter Pan. The graphic novel faced disapproval from Great Ormond Street Hospital, which denied permission to publish the book in the European Union while their copyright was still in force (through 2007). * In the 2005‚Äì2006 comic book series The Oz/Wonderland Chronicles, Wendy is portrayed as sharing an apartment with Alice from Alice In Wonderland, Dorothy Gale from The Wonderful Wizard of Oz and Susan Pevensie from The Chronicles of Narnia.  Non-fiction  * Dan Kiley's book, The Wendy Dilemma (1984), advises women romantically involved with \\"Peter Pans\\" how to improve their relationships. This book is a sequel to The Peter Pan Syndrome: Men Who Have Never Grown Up, about individuals (usually male) with underdeveloped maturity.

He painted primarily still lifes and landscapes. From 1865 to 1867, he studied landscape painting under the academician Ludwig Halauska.Lasko 2003, p. 19 Among his early works are studies of heads which he said he wished to paint \\"like still-lifes, tone by tone, without emotion\\". During the period 1882‚Äì94 he was based in Paris, where he was greatly impressed by the work of Claude Monet‚Äîwhom he described as \\"the Rembrandt of plein-air painting\\"‚Äîalthough he was attracted most of all to Rembrandt and the artists of the Barbizon school.Forster-Hahn and Riopelle 2001, p. 164 In 1884 and 1885 he spent the summer months in the Netherlands, studying the Dutch old masters as well as the contemporary painters of the Hague School, and filling notebooks with detailed descriptions of the colors he observed in paintings that he admired. Of all the artists belonging to the circle around Wilhelm Leibl (called the Leibl-Kreis), Schuch was the most devoted to color. His work marks the transition from the realist tradition to the modern movement in Vienna. Schuch's most famous, and longest friendship was with the artist Karl Hagemeister. The two met in Bavaria, traveled all over central Europe together, and settled for 3 years in Ferch, a small village south of Berlin. The two shared a very small house, sharing a single bedroom and painting the nature around Ferch. The robust Hagemeister tended to the sensitive Schuch by cooking, hunting, and fishing for the pair. It has been speculated that the two were lovers. Their friendship ended when Schuch moved to Paris. The last occasion of their meeting was when Schuch was visited by Hagemeister. This led to a disagreement about the merit of Hagemeister's then completed \\"Teller mit Austern\\" (1884), prompting Hagemeister to promptly dispose of 6 of his own works in the Seine, and a cessation of their relationship. Upon the death of Schuch, Max Liebermann prompted Hagemeister to write Schuch's biography.Karl Hagemeister: Carl Schuch. Sein Leben und seine Werke, Cassirer, Berlin 1913 Schuch was financially independent and made little effort to exhibit his work; in his lifetime he sold only one painting.Lasko 2003, p. 18 His later years were marked by a degenerative illness, and he stopped painting in 1891. He died in Vienna.

The game stars Bugs Bunny and features pre-rendered 3D graphics. Plot One night, Bugs Bunny is fast asleep in his bed, as he starts to drift off into a dream. In his dream, he sees Yosemite Sam experimenting on a \\"giant carrot serum\\", but before he could take action, Sam orders Gossamer to fetch the rabbit's brain for his robot, prompting chase. Bugs soon came across a \\"Televisor\\" and is transported to many of his times from older cartoons, in which he must complete several objectives in each level. After finishing all 4 levels, Bugs Bunny attempts to escape the haunted castle and defeat both Gossamer and Yosemite Sam in the laboratory. He eventually succeeds and exits the castle to escape inside a rocket ship. Bugs soon found himself stranded in outer space after the launch, as he spots a nearby space scooter which he uses to travel across the galaxy and face a new threat: Marvin the Martian and his trusty pet dog K-9. Upon reaching Marvin's home planet, Mars, Bugs comes across some levers and switches them around, foiling Marvin's plans, and upon leaving back to Earth, he tosses the dynamite stick he previously rescued over to Marvin, resulting in the destruction of Mars itself. Eventually, Bugs wakes up back in his bed, only to find a giant carrot sitting right in front of him, much to his shock. Gameplay Similarly to 1994's Mickey Mania: The Timeless Adventures of Mickey Mouse, the levels are mainly based on individual Bugs Bunny cartoons from Warner Bros.' Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies series, stringing them together by having Bugs trapped in a \\"Televisor\\" created by Yosemite Sam as a mad scientist. Seven of the levels are based on the Bugs Bunny cartoons Duck! Rabbit, Duck!, Bully for Bugs, Knighty Knight Bugs, Hare-Abian Nights, Spaced Out Bunny, Mad as a Mars Hare, and Hare-Way to the Stars, while the other level, entitled Haunted Hare, is based on elements of Bewitched Bunny and Hair-Raising Hare. On the Game Gear version, the Bully for Bugs level is altered to instead be named and based on the cartoon Roman Legion-Hare, though similar gameplay is maintained. The Spaced Out Bunny level is absent in the Game Gear version as well. Each level features objectives, designs, and opposing characters based on the source cartoon(s), though some levels include plot elements, weapons, and obstacles that weren't present in the original cartoons. For example, the Hare-Abian Nights level features a duel with Yosemite Sam over a genie's lamp, and Spaced Out Bunny is essentially a race against Marvin the Martian to Mars. As well, the Duck! Rabbit, Duck! level does not have the snow present in the original cartoon. Reception The Genesis version received mediocre reviews. Critics widely praised the bright, colorful graphics and usage of old Warner Bros. cartoons and characters, though some criticized that the controls make navigating certain areas frustrating. However, reviews generally concluded that while the game is competent in most respects, it lacks any major innovation to draw the interest of anyone but hardcore Warner Bros. fans. GamePro gave the Game Gear version a brief negative review, criticizing the gameplay, music, and particularly the difficult-to-see graphics, commenting that \\"Signs, enemies, and items are so tiny you'll need a magnifying glass.\\" ReferencesExternal links * 1996 video games Sega Game Gear games Video games based on Looney Tunes Platform games Sega Genesis games Single-player video games Video games developed in the United Kingdom Video games featuring Bugs Bunny Video games about dreams Video games with digitized sprites ","title":"Bugs Bunny in Double Trouble"},{"id":"6356553","text":"Dallas Protocol is a public-private partnership between the City of Dallas in the U.S. state of Texas and the World Affairs Council of Dallas/Fort Worth, established in March 2003.

Typically the probe card is mechanically docked to a prober and electrically connected to a tester. Its purpose is to provide an electrical path between the test system and the circuits on the wafer, thereby permitting the testing and validation of the circuits at the wafer level, usually before they are diced and packaged. It consists, normally, of a printed circuit board (PCB) and some form of contact elements, usually metallic, but possibly of other materials as well. A semiconductor manufacturer will typically require a new probe card for each new device wafer and for device shrinks (when the manufacturer reduces the size of the device while keeping its functionality) because the probe card is effectively a custom connector that takes the universal pattern of a given tester and translates the signals to connect to electrical pads on the wafer. For testing of DRAM and FLASH memory devices these pads are typically made of aluminum and are 40‚Äì90 um per side. Other devices may have flat pads, or raised bumps or pillars made of copper, copper alloys or many types of solders such as lead- tin, tin-silver and others. The probe card must make good electrical contact to these pads or bumps during the testing of the device. When the testing of the device is complete, the prober will index the wafer to the next device to be tested. Probe cards are broadly classified into needle type, vertical type, and MEMS(Micro Electro-Mechanical System) type depending on shape and forms of contact elements. MEMS type is the most advanced technology currently available. The most advanced type of probe card currently can test an entire 12\\" wafer with one touchdown. Normally a probe card is inserted into an equipment called a wafer prober, inside which the position of the wafer to be tested will be adjusted to ensure a precise contact between the probe card and wafer. Once the probe card and the wafer is loaded, a camera in the prober will optically locate several tips on the probe card and several marks or pads on the wafer, and using this information it will can align the pads on the device under test (DUT) to the probe card contacts. Probe card efficiency is affected by many factors. Perhaps the most important factor impacting probe card efficiency is the number of DUTs that can be tested in parallel. Many wafers today are still tested one device at a time. If one wafer had 1000 of these devices and the time required to test one device was 10 seconds and the time for the prober to move from one device to another device was 1 second, then to test an entire wafer would take 1000 x 11 seconds = 11,000 seconds or roughly 3 hours. If however, the probe card and the tester could test 16 devices in parallel (with 16 times the electrical connections) than the test time would be reduced by almost exactly 16 times (around 11 minutes). Note that because now the probe card has 16 devices, as the prober touches down on the round wafer, it may not always contact an active device and will therefore be a little less than 16 times as fast to test one wafer. Another major factor is debris that accumulates on the tips of the probe needles. Normally these are made of tungsten or tungsten/rhenium alloys or advanced palladium based alloys like PdCuAg. Some modern probe cards have contact tips manufactured by MEMS technologies. Irrespective of the probe tip material, contamination builds up on the tips as a result of successive touch down events (where the probe tips make physical contact with the bond pads of the die). Accumulation of debris has an adverse effect on the critical measurement of contact resistance. To return a used probe card to a contact resistance that is acceptable the probe tips need to be thoroughly cleaned. Cleaning can be done offline using an NWR style laser to reclaim the tips by selectively removing the contamination. Online cleaning can be used during testing to optimize the testing results within the wafer or within wafer lots.

This publication may be considered a rallying point for those who were looking for a greater degree of spirituality-based themes in everyday life, and a stepping stone towards more newsworthy efforts such as the Megatripolis nightclub. Contributors included: Neil Oram, Charles Stephens, Timothy Leary, Ken Kesey, Pete Loveday, Tony Benn, Charles Bukowski, Robert Bly and Richard Allen who went on to establish the neo-psychedelic Delerium Records label. A poetry issue was guest edited by the poet and magician Stuart Nolan. It was created in 1986 by the late Scotsman Fraser Clark who remained its editor through all 15 volumes which were actually produced. The intention of creating 100 volumes was never realised. The publication advocated a new form of hippie - the \\"Zippie\\" - who would follow Timothy Leary in his modern philosophy of \\"Drop out, and drop in again\\". In other words, embrace peace and love but also embrace technology and aspire towards the lifestyle that affords it. This was later taken to America and beyond as the Pronoia tour. In 1989 Fraser Clark and deputy editor Marcus Pennell organised the first Zippie Picnic on Hampstead Heath in London, which continues to this day. Also in 1989, the EP team were joined by northern graphic designers the Scooby Doobies who brought with them a love of rave culture. This led to the creation of Evolution magazine in 1990, and regular small underground parties which laid the way for the launch of the Megatripolis nightclub in 1993.

Following the initial riot incidents, there were further outbreaks of violence in Ahmedabad for three months; statewide, there were further outbreaks of violence against the minority Muslim population for the next year. The burning of a train in Godhra on 27 February 2002, which caused the deaths of 58 Hindu pilgrims karsevaks returning from Ayodhya, is cited as having instigated the violence. According to official figures, the riots ended with 1,044 dead, 223 missing, and 2,500 injured. Of the dead, 790 were Muslim and 254 Hindu. The Concerned Citizens Tribunal Report, estimated that as many as 1,926 may have been killed. Other sources estimated death tolls in excess of 2,000. Many brutal killings and rapes were reported on as well as widespread looting and destruction of property. Narendra Modi, then Chief Minister of Gujarat and later Prime Minister of India, was accused of initiating and condoning the violence, as were police and government officials who allegedly directed the rioters and gave lists of Muslim-owned properties to them. In 2012, Modi was cleared of complicity in the violence by Special Investigation Team (SIT) appointed by the Supreme Court of India. The SIT also rejected claims that the state government had not done enough to prevent the riots. The Muslim community was reported to have reacted with anger and disbelief. In July 2013, allegations were made that the SIT had suppressed evidence. That December, an Indian court upheld the earlier SIT report and rejected a petition seeking Modi's prosecution. In April 2014, the Supreme Court expressed satisfaction over the SIT's investigations in nine cases related to the violence, and rejected a plea contesting the SIT report as \\"baseless\\".

Other observers have stated that these events had met the \\"legal definition of genocide,\\" or referred to them as state terrorism or ethnic cleansing. Instances of mass violence include the Naroda Patiya massacre that took place directly adjacent to a police training camp; the Gulbarg Society massacre where Ehsan Jafri, a former parliamentarian, was among those killed; and several incidents in Vadodara city. Scholars studying the 2002 riots state that they were premeditated and constituted a form of ethnic cleansing, and that the state government and law enforcement were complicit in the violence that occurred. Godhra train burning On the morning of 27 February 2002, the Sabarmati Express, returning from Ayodhya to Ahmedabad, stopped near the Godhra railway station. The passengers were Hindu pilgrims, returning from Ayodhya after a religious ceremony at the site of the demolished Babri Masjid. An argument erupted between the train passengers and the vendors on the railway platform. The argument became violent and under uncertain circumstances four coaches of the train caught fire with many people trapped inside. In the resulting conflagration, 59 people (nine men, 25 women, and 25 children) burned to death. The government of Gujarat set up Gujarat High Court judge K. G. Shah as a one-man commission to look into the incident, but following outrage among families of victims and in the media over Shah's alleged closeness to Modi, retired Supreme Court judge G.T. Nanavati was added as chairman of the now two-person commission. In 2003, The Concerned Citizens Tribunal (CCT) concluded that the fire had been an accident. Several other independent commentators have also concluded that the fire itself was almost certainly an accident, saying that the initial cause of the conflagration has never been conclusively determined. Historian Ainslie Thomas Embree stated that the official story of the attack on the train (that it was organized and carried out by people under orders from Pakistan) was entirely baseless. The Union government led by the Indian National Congress party in 2005 also set up a committee to probe the incident, headed up by retired Supreme Court judge Umesh Chandra Banerjee. The committee concluded that the fire had begun inside the train and was most likely accidental. However, the Gujarat High Court ruled in 2006 that the matter was outside the jurisdiction of the union government, and that the committee was therefore unconstitutional. After six years of going over the details, Nanavati-Mehta Commission submitted its preliminary report which concluded that the fire was an act of arson, committed by a mob of one to two thousand locals. Maulvi Husain Haji Ibrahim Umarji, a cleric in Godhra, and a dismissed Central Reserve Police Force officer named Nanumiyan were presented as the \\"masterminds\\" behind the arson.The Godhra conspiracy as Justice Nanavati saw it The Times of India, 28 September 2008. Retrieved 19 February 2012. Archived 21 February 2012. After 24 extensions, the commission submitted its final report on 18 November 2014. The findings of the commission were called into question by a video recording released by Tehelka magazine, which showed Arvind Pandya, counsel for the Gujarat government, stating that the findings of the Shah-Nanavati commission would support the view presented by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), as Shah was \\"their man\\" and Nanavati could be bribed. In February 2011, the trial court convicted 31 people and acquitted 63 others based on the murder and conspiracy provisions of the Indian Penal Code, saying the incident was a \\"pre-planned conspiracy.\\" Of those convicted, 11 were sentenced to death and the other 20 to life in prison.Godhra verdict: 31 convicted, 63 acquitted NDTV ‚Äì 1 March 2011 Maulvi Umarji, presented by the Nanavati-Shah commission as the prime conspirator, was acquitted along with 62 others accused for lack of evidence. Post-Godhra violence Following the attack on the train, the Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP) called for a statewide bandh, or strike. Although the Supreme Court had declared such strikes to be unconstitutional and illegal, and despite the common tendency for such strikes to be followed by violence, no action was taken by the state to prevent the strike. The government did not attempt to stop the initial outbreak of violence across the state. Independent reports indicate that the state BJP president Rana Rajendrasinh had endorsed the strike, and that Modi and Rana used inflammatory language which worsened the situation. Then-Chief Minister Narendra Modi declared that the attack on the train had been an act of terrorism, and not an incident of communal violence. Local newspapers and members of the state government used the statement to incite violence against the Muslim community by claiming, without proof, that the attack on the train was carried out by Pakistan's intelligence agency and that local Muslims had conspired with them to attack Hindus in the state. False stories were also printed by local newspapers which claimed that Muslim people had kidnapped and raped Hindu women. Numerous accounts describe the attacks on the Muslim community that began on 28 February (the day after the train fire) as highly coordinated with mobile phones and government-issued printouts listing the homes and businesses of Muslims. Attackers arrived in Muslim communities across the region in trucks, wearing saffron robes and khaki shorts, bearing a variety of weapons. In many cases, attackers damaged or burned Muslim-owned or occupied buildings while leaving adjacent Hindu buildings untouched. Although many calls to the police were made from victims, they were told by the police that \\"we have no orders to save you.\\" In some cases, the police fired on Muslims who attempted to defend themselves. The rioters used mobile phones to coordinate their attacks. By the end of the day on 28 February a curfew had been declared in 27 towns and cities across the state. A government minister stated that although the circumstances were tense in Baroda and Ahmedabad, the situation was under control, and that the police who had been deployed were enough to prevent any violence. In Baroda the administration imposed a curfew in seven areas of the city. M. D. Antani, then the deputy superintendent of police, deployed the Rapid Action Force to sensitive areas in Godhra. Gordhan Zadafia, the Minister of State for Home, believed there would be no retaliation from the Hindu community for the train burning. Modi stated that the violence was no longer as intense as it had been and that it would soon be brought under control, and that if the situation warranted it, the police would be supported by deploying the army. A shoot-to-kill order was issued. However the troop deployment was withheld by the state government until 1 March, when the most severe violence had ended. After more than two months of violence a unanimous vote to authorize central intervention was passed in the upper house of parliament. Members of the opposition made accusations that the government had failed to protect Muslim people in the worst rioting in India in more than 10 years. It is estimated that 230 mosques and 274 dargahs were destroyed during the violence. For the first time in the history of communal riots Hindu women took part, looting Muslim shops. It is estimated that up to 150,000 people were displaced during the violence. It is estimated that 200 police officers died while trying to control the violence, and Human Rights Watch reported that acts of exceptional heroism were committed by Hindus, Dalits and tribals who tried to protect Muslims from the violence. Attacks on Muslims In the aftermath of the violence, it became clear that many attacks were focused not only on Muslim populations, but also on Muslim women and children. Organizations such as Human Rights Watch criticised the Indian government and the Gujarat state administration for failure to address the resulting humanitarian condition of victims who fled their homes for relief camps during the violence, the \\"overwhelming majority of them Muslim.\\" According to Teesta Setalvad on 28 February in the districts of Morjari Chowk and Charodia Chowk in Ahmedabad of all forty people who had been killed by police shooting were Muslim. An international fact-finding committee formed of all women international experts from US, UK, France, Germany and Sri Lanka reported, \\"sexual violence was being used as a strategy for terrorizing women belonging to minority community in the state.\\" It is estimated that at least two-hundred and fifty girls and women were gang raped and then burned to death. Children were force fed petrol and then set on fire, pregnant women were gutted and then had their unborn child's body shown to them. In the Naroda Patiya mass grave of ninety-six bodies, forty-six were women. Rioters also flooded homes and electrocuted entire families inside. Violence against women also included them being stripped naked, violated with objects, and then killed. According to Kalpana Kannabiran the rapes were part of a well-organized, deliberate and pre-planned strategy, and which facts place the violence into the categories of political pogrom and genocide. Other acts of violence against women included acid attacks, beatings and the killing of women who were pregnant. Children were also killed in front of their parents. George Fernandes in a discussion in parliament on the violence caused widespread furor in his defense of the state government, saying that this was not the first time that women had been violated and raped in India. Children were killed by being burnt alive and those who dug the mass graves described the bodies interred within them as \\"burned and butchered beyond recognition.\\" Children and infants were speared and held aloft before being thrown into fires. Describing the sexual violence perpetrated against Muslim women and girls, Renu Khanna writes that the survivors reported that it \\"consisted of forced nudity, mass rapes, gang-rapes, mutilation, insertion of objects into bodies, cutting of breasts, slitting the stomach and reproductive organs, and carving of Hindu religious symbols on women's body parts.\\" The Concerned Citizens' Tribunal, characterised the use of rape \\"as an instrument for the subjugation and humiliation of a community.\\" Testimony heard by the committee stated that: > A chilling technique, absent in pogroms unleashed hitherto but very much in > evidence this time in a large number of cases, was the deliberate > destruction of evidence. Barring a few, in most instances of sexual > violence, the women victims were stripped and paraded naked, then gang- > raped, and thereafter quartered and burnt beyond recognition. . . . The > leaders of the mobs even raped young girls, some as young as 11 years old . > . . before burning them alive. . . . Even a 20-day-old infant, or a fetus in > the womb of its mother, was not spared. Vandana Shiva stated that \\"Young boys have been taught to burn, rape and kill in the name of Hindutva.\\" Dionne Bunsha, writing on the Gulbarg Society massacre and murder of Ehsan Jafri, has said that when Jafri begged the crowd to spare the women, he was dragged into the street and forced to parade naked for refusing to say \\"Jai Shri Ram.\\" He was then beheaded and thrown onto a fire, after which rioters returned and burned Jafri's family, including two small boys, to death. After the massacre Gulbarg remained in flames for a week. Attacks on Hindus The Times of India reported that over ten thousand Hindus were displaced during the violence. According to police records, 157 riots after the Godhra incident were started by Muslims. In Mahajan No Vando, a Hindu residential area in Jamalpur, residents reported that Muslim attackers injured approximately twenty-five Hindu residents and destroyed five houses on 1 March. The community head reported that the police responded quickly, but were ineffectual as there were so few of them present to help during the attack. The colony was later visited by Modi on 6 March, who promised the residents that they would be taken care of. On 17 March, it was reported that Muslims attacked Dalits in the Danilimda area of Ahmedabad. In Himatnagar, a man was reportedly found dead with both his eyes gouged out. The Sindhi Market and Bhanderi Pole areas of Ahmedabad were also reportedly attacked by mobs. India Today reported on 20 May 2002 that there were sporadic attacks on Hindus in Ahmedabad. On 5 May, Muslim rioters attacked Bhilwas locality in the Shah Alam area.Gujarat riots: As death toll rises, CM Narendra Modi image hits a new low, India Today, 20 May 2002 Hindu doctors were asked to stop practicing in Muslim areas after one Hindu doctor was stabbed.Docs told to stay off minority areas, Times of India, 11 April 2002 Frontline magazine reported that in Ahmedabad of the 249 bodies recovered by 5 March, thirty were Hindu. Of the Hindus that had been killed, thirteen had died as a result of police action and several others had died while attacking Muslim owned properties. Despite the relatively few attacks by Muslim mobs on Hindu neighbourhoods, twenty-four Muslims were reported to have died in police shootings. Media coverage The events in Gujarat were the first instance of communal violence in India in the age of 24-hour news coverage and were televised worldwide. This coverage played a central role in the politics of the situation. Media coverage was generally critical of the Hindu right; however, the BJP portrayed the coverage as an assault on the honor of Gujaratis and turned the hostility into an emotive part of their electoral campaign. With the violence receding in April, a peace meeting was arranged at Sabarmati Ashram, a former home of Mahatma Gandhi. Hindutva supporters and police officers attacked almost a dozen journalists. The state government banned television news channels critical of the government's response, and local stations were blocked. Two reporters working for STAR News were assaulted several times while covering the violence. On a return trip from having interviewed Modi when their car was surrounded by a crowd, one of the crowd claimed that they would be killed should they be a member of a minority community. The Editors Guild of India, in its report on media ethics and coverage on the incidents stated that the news coverage was exemplary, with only a few minor lapses. The local newspapers Sandesh and Gujarat Samachar, however, were heavily criticised. The report states that Sandesh had headlines which would \\"provoke, communalize and terrorize people. The newspaper also used a quote from a VHP leader as a headline, \\"Avenge with blood.\\" The report stated that Gujarat Samachar had played a role in increasing the tensions but did not give all of its coverage over to \\"hawkish and inflammatory reportage in the first few weeks\\". The paper carried reports to highlight communal harmony. Gujarat Today was given praise for showing restraint and for the balanced reportage of the violence. Critical reporting on the Gujarat government's handling of the situation helped bring about the Indian government's intervention in controlling the violence. The Editors Guild rejected the charge that graphic news coverage aggravated the situation, saying that the coverage exposed the \\"horrors\\" of the riots as well as the \\"supine if not complicit\\" attitude of the state, helping to propel remedial action. Allegations of state complicity Many scholars and commentators have accused the state government of being complicit in the attacks, either in failing to exert any effort to quell the violence or for actively planning and executing the attacks themselves. The United States Department of State ultimately banned Narendra Modi from travelling to the United States due to his alleged role in the attacks. These allegations center around several ideas. First, the state did little to quell the violence, with attacks continuing well through the Spring. The historian Gyanendra Pandey described these attacks as state terrorism, saying that they were not riots but \\"organized political massacres.\\" According to Paul Brass the only conclusion from the evidence which is available points to a methodical Anti- Muslim pogrom which was carried out with exceptional brutality coordination. The media has described the attacks as state terrorism rather than \\"communal riots\\" due to the lack of state intervention. Many politicians downplayed the incidents, claiming that the situation was under control. One minister who spoke with Rediff.com stated that though the circumstances were tense in Baroda and Ahmedabad, the situation was under control, and that the police who had been deployed were enough to prevent any violence. The deputy superintendent of police stated that the Rapid Action Force had been deployed to sensitive areas in Godhra. Gordhan Zadafia, the Minister of State for Home, stated that he believed there would be no retaliation from the Hindu community. Once troops were airlifted in on 1 March, Modi stated that the violence was no longer as intense as it had been and that it would soon be brought under control. The violence continued for 3 months with no intervention from the federal government till May. Local and state-level politicians were seen leading violent mobs, restraining the police and arranging the distribution of weapons, leading investigative reports to conclude that the violence was \\"engineered and launched.\\" Throughout the violence, attacks were made in full view of police stations and police officers who did not intervene. In many instances, police joined the mobs in perpetrating violence. At one Muslim locality, of the twenty-nine deaths, sixteen were caused by police firing into the locality. Some rioters even had printouts of voter registration lists, allowing them to selectively target Muslim properties. Selective targeting of properties was shown by the destruction of the offices of the Muslim Wakf board which was located within the confines of the high security zone and just 500 meters from the office of the chief minister. According to Scott W. Hibbard, the violence had been planned far in advance, and that similar to other instances of communal violence the Bajrang Dal, the VHP and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) all took part in the attacks. Following the attack on the train the VHP called for a statewide bandh (strike), and the state took no action to prevent this. The Concerned Citizens Tribunal (CCT) report includes testimony of the then Gujarat BJP minister Haren Pandya (since murdered), who testified about an evening meeting convened by Modi the evening of the train burning. At this meeting, officials were instructed not to obstruct the Hindu rage following the incident. The report also highlighted a second meeting, held in Lunawada village of Panchmahal district, attended by state ministers Ashok Bhatt, and Prabhatsinh Chauhan, among other BJP and RSS leaders, where \\"detailed plans were made on the use of kerosene and petrol for arson and other methods of killing.\\" The Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind claimed in 2002 that some regional Congress workers collaborated with the perpetrators of the violence. Dipankar Gupta believes that the state and police were clearly complicit in the violence, but that some officers were outstanding in the performance of their duties, such as Himanshu Bhatt and Rahul Sharma. Sharma was reported to have said \\"I don't think any other job would have allowed me to save so many lives.\\" Human Rights Watch has reported on acts of exceptional heroism by Hindus, Dalits and tribals who tried to protect Muslims from the violence. In response to allegations of state involvement, Gujarat government spokesman, Bharat Pandya, told the BBC that the rioting was a spontaneous Hindu backlash fueled by widespread anger against Muslims. He said \\"Hindus are frustrated over the role of Muslims in the on-going violence in Indian-administered Kashmir and other parts of India.\\" In support of this, the US Ambassador at-large for International Religious Freedom, John Hanford, expressed concern over religious intolerance in Indian politics and said that while the rioters may have been aided by state and local officials, he did not believe that the BJP- led central government was involved in inciting the riots. Criminal prosecutions Prosecution of the perpetrators of the violence hampered by witnesses being bribed or intimidated and the perpetrators' names being deleted from the charge sheets. Local judges were also biased. After more than two years of acquittals, the Supreme Court of India stepped in, transferring key cases to the Bombay High Court and ordering the police to reopen two thousand cases that had been previously closed. The Supreme Court also lambasted the Gujarat government as \\"modern day Neros\\" who looked elsewhere when innocent women and children were burning and then interfered with prosecution. Following this direction, police identified nearly 1,600 cases for re-investigation, arrested 640 accused and launched investigations against forty police officers for their failures. In March 2008, the Supreme Court ordered the setting up of a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to reinvestigate the Godhra train burning case and key cases of post-Godhra violence. The former CBI Director R. K. Raghavan was appointed to chair the Team. Christophe Jaffrelot notes that the SIT was not as independent as commonly believed. Other than Raghavan, half of the six members of the team were recruited from the Gujarat police, and the Gujarat High Court was still responsible for appointing judicial officers. The SIT made efforts to appoint independent prosecutors but some of them resigned due to their inability to function. No efforts were made to protect the witnesses and Raghavan himself was said to be an \\"absentee investigator,\\" who spent only a few days every month in Gujarat, with the investigations being conducted by the remainder of the team. As of April 2013, 249 convictions had been secured of 184 Hindus and 65 Muslims. Thirty-one of the Muslim convictions were for the massacre of Hindus in Godhra. Best Bakery case The Best Bakery murder trial received wide attention after witnesses retracted testimony in court and all of the accused were acquitted. The Indian Supreme Court, acting on a petition by social activist Teesta Setalvad, ordered a retrial outside Gujarat in which nine accused were found guilty in 2006.Dionne Bunsha, Verdict in Best Bakery case, Frontline, Volume 23 ‚Äì Issue 04, 25 February ‚Äì 10 March 2006 A key witness, Zaheera Sheikh, who repeatedly changed her testimony during the trials and the petition was found guilty of perjury. Bilkis Bano case After police dismissed the case against her assailants, Bilkis Bano approached the National Human Rights Commission of India and petitioned the Supreme Court seeking a reinvestigation. The Supreme Court granted the motion, directing the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to take over the investigation. CBI appointed a team of experts from the Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CFSL) Delhi and All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) under the guidance and leadership of Professor T. D. Dogra of AIIMS to exhume the mass graves to established the identity and cause of death of victims. The team successfully located and exhumed the remains of victims. The trial of the case was transferred out of Gujarat and the central government was directed to appoint a public prosecutor. Charges were filed in a Mumbai court against nineteen people as well as six police officials and a government doctor over their role in the initial investigations. In January 2008, eleven men were sentenced to life imprisonment for rapes and murders and a policeman was convicted of falsifying evidence. The Bombay High Court upheld the life imprisonment of eleven men convicted for the gang rape of Bilkis Bano and murder of her family members during the 2002 Gujarat riots on 8 May 2017. The court also set aside the acquittal of the remaining seven accused in the case, including Gujarat police officers and doctors of a government hospital, who were charged with suppressing and tampering with evidence. Later, the final verdict came on 23 April 2019 as the Supreme Court ordered the Gujarat government to pay Bilkis Yakoob Rasool Bano ‚Çπ50 lakh as compensation, a government job and housing in the area of her choice.https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sc-orders- gujarat-govt-to-pay-50-lakh-compensation-to-bilkis-bano/article26919852.ece Avdhootnagar case In 2005, the Vadodara fast-track court acquitted 108 people accused of murdering two youths during a mob attack on a group of displaced Muslims returning under police escort to their homes in Avdhootnagar. The court passed strictures against the police for failing to protect the people under their escort and failing to identify the attackers they had seen. Danilimda case Nine people were convicted of killing a Hindu man and injuring another during group clashes in Danilimda, Ahmedabad on 12 April 2005, while twenty-five others were acquitted. Eral case Eight people, including a VHP leader and a member of the BJP, were convicted for the murder of seven members of a family and the rape of two minor girls in the village of Eral in Panchmahal district. Pavagadh and Dhikva case Fifty- two people from Pavagadh and Dhikva villages in Panchmahal district were acquitted of rioting charges for lack of evidence. Godhra train-burning case A stringent anti-terror law, the POTA, was used by the Gujarat government to charge 131 people in connection to the Godhra train fire, but not invoked in prosecuting any of the accused in the post-Godhra riots. In 2005 the POTA Review Committee set up by the central government to review the application of the law opined that the Godhra accused should not have been tried under the provisions of POTA. In February 2011 a special fast track court convicted thirty-one Muslims for the Godhra train burning incident and the conspiracy for the crime Dipda Darwaza case On 9 November 2011, a court in Ahmedabad sentenced thirty-one Hindus to life imprisonment for murdering dozens of Muslims by burning a building in which they took shelter. Forty-one other Hindus were acquitted of murder charges due to a lack of evidence. Twenty-two further people were convicted for attempted murder on 30 July 2012, while sixty-one others were acquitted. Naroda Patiya Massacre On 29 July 2012, an Indian court convicted thirty people in the Naroda Patiya massacre case for their involvement in the attacks. The convicted included former state minister Maya Kodnani and Hindu leader Babu Bajrangi. The court case began in 2009, and over three hundred people (including victims, witnesses, doctors, and journalists) testified before the court. For the first time, the verdict acknowledged the role of a politician in inciting Hindu mobs. Activists asserted that the verdict would embolden the opponent of Narendra Modi, the then chief minister of Gujarat, in the crucial run-up to state elections later that year, when Modi would be seeking a third term (The BJP and he eventually went on to win the elections). Modi refused to apologise and denied that the government had a role in the riots. Twenty-nine people were acquitted during the verdict. Teesta Setalvad said \\"For the first time, this judgment actually goes beyond neighborhood perpetrators and goes up to the political conspiracy. The fact that convictions have gone that high means the conspiracy charge has been accepted and the political influencing of the mobs has been accepted by the judge. This is a huge victory for justice.\\" Perjury cases In April 2009, the SIT submitted before the Court that Teesta Setalvad had cooked up cases of violence to spice up the incidents. The SIT which is headed by former CBI director, R. K. Raghavan has said that false witnesses were tutored to give evidence about imaginary incidents by Setalvad and other NGOs. The SIT charged her of \\"cooking up macabre tales of killings.\\"Setalvad in dock for 'cooking up killings' \\"Setalvad in dock for 'cooking up killings'\\". The Economic Times. Retrieved 11 May 2009. 14 May 2009. The court was told that twenty-two witnesses, who had submitted identical affidavits before various courts relating to riot incidents, were questioned by SIT and it was found that the witnesses had not actually witnessed the incidents and they were tutored and the affidavits were handed over to them by Setalvad. Inquiries There were more than sixty investigations by national and international bodies many of which concluded that the violence was supported by state officials. A report from the National Human Rights Commission of India (NHRC) stated that res ipsa loquitur applied as the state had comprehensively failed to protect uphold the rights of the people as set out in the Constitution of India. It faulted the Gujarat government for failure of intelligence, failure to take appropriate action, and failure to identify local factors and players. NHRC also expressed \\"widespread lack of faith\\" in the integrity of the investigation of major incidents of violence. It recommended that five critical cases should be transferred to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). The US State Department's International Religious Freedom Report quoted the NHRC as concluding that the attacks had been premeditated, that state government officials were complicit, and that there was evidence of police not acting during the assaults on Muslims. The US State Department also cited how Gujarat's high school textbooks described Hitler's \\"charismatic personality\\" and the \\"achievements of Nazism.\\"The 2003 International Report by the US State Department can be found here. It states > The Gujarat State Higher Secondary Board, to which nearly 98 percent of > schools in Gujarat belong, requires the use of certain textbooks in which > Nazism is condoned. In the Standard 10 social studies textbook, the > \\"charismatic personality\\" of \\"Hitler the Supremo\\" and the \\"achievements of > Nazism\\" are described at length. The textbook does not acknowledge Nazi > extermination policies or concentration camps except for a passing reference > to \\"a policy of opposition towards the Jewish people and [advocacy for] the > supremacy of the German race.\\" The Standard 9 social studies textbook > implies that Muslims, Christians, Parsees, and Jews are \\"foreigners.\\" In > 2002 the Gujarat State Higher Secondary Board administered an exam, while > the riots were ongoing, in which students of English were asked to form one > sentence out of the following: \\"There are two solutions. One of them is the > Nazi solution. If you don't like people, kill them, segregate them. Then > strut up and down. Proclaim that you are the salt of the earth.\\" US Congressmen John Conyers and Joe Pitts subsequently introduced a resolution in the House condemning the conduct of Modi for inciting religious persecution. They stated that Modi's government had a role in \\"promoting the attitudes of racial supremacy, racial hatred and the legacy of Nazism through his government's support of school textbooks in which Nazism is glorified.\\" They also wrote a letter to the US State Department asking it deny Modi a visa to the United States. The CCT consisting of eminent high court judges released a detailed three-volume report on the riots. Headed by retired Supreme Court Justice Krishna Iyer, the CCT released its findings in 2003 and stated that, contrary to the government allegation of a conspiracy in Godhra, the incident had not been pre-planned and there was no evidence to indicate otherwise. On the statewide riots, the CCT reported that, several days before the Godhra incident, which was the excuse used for the attacks, homes belonging to Hindus in Muslim areas had been marked with pictures of Hindu deities or saffron flags, and that this had been done to prevent any accidental assaults on Hindu homes or businesses. The CCT investigation also discovered evidence that the VHP and the Bajrang Dal had training camps in which people were taught to view Muslims as an enemy. These camps were backed and supported by the BJP and RSS. They also reported that \\"The complicity of the state government is obvious. And, the support of the central government to the state government in all that it did is also by now a matter of common knowledge.\\" The state government commissioned J. G. Shah to conduct, what became, a controversial one man inquiry into the Godhra incident, its credibility was questioned and the NHRC and the National Minorities Commission requested that a sitting judge from the supreme court be appointed. The supreme court overturned the findings by Shah stating, \\"this judgement is not based on the understanding of any evidence, but on imagination.\\" Early in 2003, the state government of Gujarat set up the Nanavati-Shah commission to investigate the entire incident, from the initial one at Godhra to the ensuing violence. The commission was caught up in controversy from the beginning. Activists and members of the opposition insisted on a judicial commission to be set up and headed by a sitting judge rather than a retired one from the high court. The state government refused. Within a few months Nanavati, before hearing any testimony declared there was no evidence of lapses by either the police or government in their handling of the violence. In 2008 Shah died and was replaced by Justice Akshay Mehta, another retired high court judge. Metha's appointment was controversial as he was the judge who allowed Babu Bajrangi, a prime suspect in the massacre Naroda Patiya massacre, to be released on bail. In July 2013 the commission was given its 20th extension, and Mukul Sinha of the civil rights group Jan Sangharsh Manch said of the delays \\"I think the Commission has lost its significance and it now seems to be awaiting the outcome of the 2014 Lok Sabha election.\\" In 2007 Tehelka in an undercover operation had said that the Nanavati-Shah commission had relied on \\"manufactured evidence.\\" Tehelka editor Tarun Tejpal has claimed that they had taped witnesses who stated they had given false testimony after they had been bribed by the Gujarati police force. Tehelka also recorded Ranjitsinh Patel where he stated that he and Prabhatsinh Patel had been paid fifty thousand rupees each to amend earlier statements and to identify some Muslims as conspirators. According to B G Verghese, the Tehelka expose was far too detailed to have been fake. A fact finding mission by the Sahmat organisation led by Dr. Kamal Mitra Chenoy concluded that the violence was more akin to ethnic cleansing or a pogrom rather than communal violence. The report said that the violence surpassed other periods of communal violence such as in 1969, 1985, 1989, and 1992 not only in the total loss of life, but also in the savagery of the attacks. Aftermath=Rioting in Gujarat There was widespread destruction of property. 273 dargahs, 241 mosques, 19 temples, and 3 churches were either destroyed or damaged.DESTROYED, DAMAGED RELIGIOUS STRUCTURES IN GUJARAT Radiance Viewsweekly, 10 November 2012. It is estimated that Muslim property losses were \\"100,000 houses, 1,100 hotels, 15,000 businesses, 3,000 handcarts and 5,000 vehicles.\\" Overall, 27,780 people were arrested. Of them, 11,167 were arrested for criminal behavior (3,269 Muslim, 7,896 Hindu) and 16,615 were arrested as a preventive measure (2,811 Muslim, 13,804 Hindu). The CCT tribunal reported that 90 percent of those arrested were almost immediately granted bail, even if they had been arrested on suspicion of murder or arson. There were also media reports that political leaders gave those being released public welcomes. This contradicts the state government's statement during the violence that: \\"Bail applications of all accused persons are being strongly defended and rejected.\\" Police transfers According to R. B. Sreekumar, police officers who followed the rule of law and helped prevent the riots from spreading were punished by the Modi government. They were subjected to disciplinary proceedings and transfers with some having to leave the state. Sreekumar also claims it is common practice to intimidate whistleblowers and otherwise subvert the justice system, and that the state government issued \\"unconstitutional directives\\", with officials asking him to kill Muslims involved in rioting or disrupting a Hindu religious event. The Gujarat government denied his allegations, claiming that they were \\"baseless\\" and based on malice because Sreekumar had not been promoted. Further promotion of communal violence by Shiv sena, VHP and Muslim extremist groups Following the violence Bal Thackeray then leader of the Hindu nationalist group Shiv Sena said \\"Muslims are a cancer to this country. . . . Cancer is an incurable disease. Its only cure is operation. O Hindus, take weapons in your hands and remove this cancer from your roots.\\" Pravin Togadia, international president of the Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP), said \\"All Hindutva opponents will get the death sentence\\" and Ashok Singhal, the then president of the VHP, has said that the violence in Gujarat was a \\"successful experiment\\" which would be repeated nationwide. The militant group Indian Mujahideen have carried out attacks in revenge and to also act as a deterrent against further instances of mass violence against Muslims. They also claimed to have carried out the 2008 Delhi bombings in revenge for mistreatment of Muslims, referencing the destruction of the Babri Mosque and the violence in Gujarat 2002. In September 2002 there was an attack on the Hindu temple of Akshardham, gunmen carried letters on their persons which suggested that it was a revenge attack for the violence that Muslims had undergone. In August 2002 Shahid Ahmad Bakshi, an operative for the militant group Lashkar-e-Toiba planned to assassinate Modi, Pravin Togadia of the VHP, and other members of the right wing nationalist movement to avenge the 2002 Gujarat violence. Human Rights Watch has accused the state of orchestrating a cover-up of their role in the violence. Human rights activists and Indian solicitors have urged that legislation be passed so that \\"communal violence is treated as genocide.\\" Following the violence thousands of Muslims were fired from their places of work, and those who tried to return home had to endure an economic and social boycott. Organisational changes and political reactions On 3 May 2002, former Punjab police chief Kanwar Pal Singh Gill was appointed as security adviser to Modi. Defending the Modi administration in the Rajya Sabha against charges of genocide, BJP spokesman V. K. Malhotra said that the official toll of 254 Hindus, killed mostly by police fire, indicates how the state authorities took effective steps to curb the violence. Opposition parties and three coalition partners of the BJP-led central government demanded the dismissal of Modi for failing to contain the violence, with some calling for the removal of Union Home Minister L. K. Advani as well. On 18 July, Modi asked the Governor of Gujarat to dissolve the state assembly and call fresh elections. The Indian Election Commission ruled out early elections citing the prevailing law and order situation and held them in December 2002. The BJP capitalised on the violence using posters and videotapes of the Godhra incident and painting Muslims as terrorists. The party gained in all the constituencies affected by the communal violence and a number of candidates implicated in the violence were elected, which in turn ensured freedom from prosecution. Media investigation In 2004, the weekly magazine Tehelka published a hidden camera expos√© alleging that BJP legislator Madhu Srivastava bribed Zaheera Sheikh, a witness in the Best Bakery case. Srivastava denied the allegation, and an inquiry committee appointed by the Supreme Court drew an \\"adverse inference\\" from the video footage, though it failed to uncover evidence that money was actually paid. In a 2007 expose, the magazine released hidden camera footage of several members of the BJP, VHP and the Bajrang Dal admitting their role in the riots. Among those featured in the tapes was the special counsel representing the Gujarat government before the Nanavati-Shah Commission, Arvind Pandya, who resigned from his post after the release. While the report was criticised by some as being politically motivated, some newspapers said the revelations simply reinforced what was common knowledge. However, the report contradicted official records with regard to Modi's alleged visit to Naroda Patiya and a local police superintendent's location. The Gujarat government blocked telecast of cable news channels broadcasting the expose, a move strongly condemned by the Editors Guild of India. Taking a stand decried by the media and other rights groups, Nafisa Hussain, a member of the National Commission for Women accused organisations and the media of needlessly exaggerating the plight of women victims of the riots, which was strongly disputed as Gujarat did not have a State Commission for Women to act on the ground. The newspaper Tribune reported that \\"The National Commission for Women has reluctantly agreed to the complicity of Gujarat Government in the communal violence in the state.\\" The tone of their most recent report was reported by the Tribune as \\"lenient\\". Special Investigation Team In April 2012, the three-member SIT formed in 2008 by the Supreme Court as a response to a petition by one of the aggrieved in the Gulmerg massacre absolved Modi of any involvement in the Gulberg massacre, arguably the worst episode of the riots. In his report, Raju Ramachandran, the amicus curiae for the case, strongly disagreed with a key conclusion of R. K. Raghavan who led SIT: that IPS officer Sanjiv Bhatt was not present at a late-night meeting of top Gujarat cops held at the Chief Minister's residence in the wake of 27 February 2002 Godhra carnage. It has been Bhatt's claim‚Äîmade in an affidavit before the apex court and in statements to the SIT and the amicus‚Äîthat he was present at the meeting where Modi allegedly said Hindus must be allowed to carry out retaliatory violence against Muslims. Ramachandran was of the opinion that Modi could be prosecuted for alleged statements he had made. He said there was no clinching material available in the pre-trial stage to disbelieve Bhatt, whose claim could be tested only in court. \\"Hence, it cannot be said, at this stage, that Shri Bhatt should be disbelieved and no further proceedings should be taken against Shri Modi.\\" Further, R. K. Shah, the public prosecutor in the Gulbarg Society massacre, resigned because he found it impossible to work with the SIT and further stated that \\"Here I am collecting witnesses who know something about a gruesome case in which so many people, mostly women and children huddled in Jafri's house, were killed and I get no cooperation. The SIT officers are unsympathetic towards witnesses, they try to browbeat them and don't share evidence with the prosecution as they are supposed to do.\\" Teesta Setalvad referred to the stark inequalities between the SIT team's lawyers who are paid 9 lakh rupees per day and the government prosecutors who are paid a pittance. SIT officers have been paid Rs. 1.5 lakh per month for their participation in the SIT since 2008. Diplomatic ban Modi's failure to stop anti-Muslim violence led to a de facto travel ban imposed by the United Kingdom, United States, and several European nations, as well as the boycott of his provincial government by all but the most junior officials.https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/22/uk-ends-boycott- narendra-modi In 2005, Modi was refused a US visa as someone held responsible for a serious violation of religious freedom. Modi had been invited to the US to speak before the Asian-American Hotel Owners Association. A petition was set up by Coalition Against Genocide led by Angana Chatterji and signed by 125 academics requesting that Modi be refused a diplomatic visa. Hindu groups in the US also protested and planned to demonstrate in cities in Florida. A resolution was submitted by John Conyers and Joseph R. Pitts in the House of Representatives which condemned Modi for inciting religious persecution. Pitts also wrote to then United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice requesting Modi be refused a visa. On 19 March Modi was denied a diplomatic visa and his tourist visa was revoked. As Modi rose to prominence in India, the UK and the EU lifted their bans in October 2012 and March 2013, respectively, and after his election as prime minister he was invited to Washington, in the US. Relief efforts By 27 March 2002, nearly one-hundred thousand displaced people moved into 101 relief camps. This swelled to over 150,000 in 104 camps the next two weeks. The camps were run by community groups and NGOs, with the government committing to provide amenities and supplementary services. Drinking water, medical help, clothing and blankets were in short supply at the camps. At least another 100 camps were denied government support, according to a camp organiser, and relief supplies were prevented from reaching some camps due to fears that they may be carrying arms. Reactions to the relief effort were further critical of the Gujarat government. Relief camp organisers alleged that the state government was coercing refugees to leave relief camps, with twenty-five thousand people made to leave eighteen camps which were shut down. Following government assurances that further camps would not be shut down, the Gujarat High Court bench ordered that camp organizers be given a supervisory role to ensure that assurances were met. On 9 September 2002, Modi mentioned during a speech that he was against running relief camps. In January 2010, the Supreme Court ordered the government to hand over the speech and other documents to the SIT. > What brother, should we run relief camps? Should I start children-producing > centres there? We want to achieve progress by pursuing the policy of family > planning with determination. Ame paanch, Amara pachhees! (we are five and we > have twenty-five) . . . Can't Gujarat implement family planning? Whose > inhibitions are coming in our way? Which religious sect is coming in the > way? . . .\\" On 23 May 2008, the Union Government announced a 3.2 billion rupee (US$80 million) relief package for the victims of the riots. In contrast, Amnesty International's annual report on India in 2003 claimed the \\"Gujarat government did not actively fulfill its duty to provide appropriate relief and rehabilitation to the survivors\\". The Gujarat government initially offered compensation payments of 200,000 rupees to the families of those who died in the Godhra train fire and 100,000 rupees to the families of those who died in the subsequent riots, which local Muslims took to be discriminatory.Dugger, Celia W.

In its second year, Mein printed names in the paper that accused some colonial merchants of breaking a British nonimportation agreement. In response, Mein's name appeared on a list of merchants who violated the trade agreement.

Annapolis, MD. \\"Mission and Vision.\\" Accessed 2010-03-26.  Programs  CBF offers an outdoor education program that has introduced several generations of school children to the Chesapeake Bay through several idyllic outposts along the Bay's shores, such as Fox Island, Smith Island, Bishops Head, and others. Children learn the fragile nature of the Bay's ecosystem, and the extent of its watershed, much of which includes their own homes in suburbia. CBF also lobbies state and local governments on regulations intended to protect the health of the Bay. Along with education and advocacy, the CBF also moves to make the Bay cleaner through restoration and litigation. Their mission is to restore the Bay to balance in environmental programs such as planting trees and other greenery, along with restoring oyster populations. In litigation, the CBF makes it their mission to hold environmentally negligent companies and organizations accountable for their actions.  New headquarters building  In 2001, CBF moved from a walkable downtown location in Annapolis to a new headquarters building, the Philip Merrill Environmental Center, about 5 miles (8 km) outside of town. The new building, at the former site of the Bay Ridge Inn on the western shore of the Chesapeake Bay, is a green building that demonstrates a number of energy-saving and other sustainable features. It was the first building to receive the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) \\"Platinum\\" rating from the United States Green Building Council.CBF. \\"The Philip Merrill Center: CBF's Headquarters.\\" Accessed 2010-03-26. The new headquarters is not accessible by public transportation. The foundation's choice for a new headquarters site symbolizes a dilemma of the modern environmental movement: how to be connected to the environment without despoiling it. In this case, the enlarged footprint of employees and visitors forced to drive to the building was offset by its reduced imperviousness compared to the former inn, use of recycled materials, re-use of wastewater on-site, and use of composting toilets. The building was an early adopter of green building principles, but apart from automobiles and bicycles, remains inaccessible by other modes of transportation.

Description The village has a church which is over 600 years old and a primary school. Back in the early 19th century the house just past the Church used to be a coaching inn, but the local Lord of the Manor had it closed down as all of his farm labourers were spending their wages in there and not getting any work done (according to local history). The property is now a private residence. There is now no pub in the village these days In 1801 the village had a population of 420St Andrews Major, Genuki (quoting A Topographical Dictionary of The Dominion of Wales by Nicholas Carlisle, London, 1811). Retrieved 2 September 2017. and 474 in 1833 although now it is simply a small hamlet with less than 150 residents. Geography The surrounding soil of the parish is a strong, brown, dry earth, well adapted for grain of all kinds. The substratum of the whole is limestone. The ground is rather elevated and hilly towards the northern, side of the parish, and flat and level towards the southern side. It is sometimes subject to partial inundation from the overflowing of a small stream, called Dinas Powis brook, which runs through the south-eastern part of the parish towards the south, and empties itself into the Bristol Channel, between the parishes of Cadoxton and Sully, which lie between St. Andrew's and the channel. The nearby St Andrews Quarry has provided limestone for roadbuilding and gravel and also the windows of St Peter's Church at Dinas Powys.Tilney, Dinas Powys, St Andrews Major and Michealston-le-Pit From Old Photographs, page 9 The Church The church is dedicated to St. Andrew, and is in the Benefice of St. Andrews Major and Michaelston-le-Pit. At the east end of the north aisle, parallel with the chancel, is a private chapel, anciently the property and burial-place of a respectable family, named Rowel, long since extinct, and the Bouville family who were owners of a great part of the parish. In the floor of this chapel there is a stone bearing an inscription of the tombs of a couple who had both lived extremely long lives: John Wesley is reputed to have preached from the pulpit. The Rectory, behind the church, was built in 1830 and its gardens used for village celebrations and events. It was built to replace The Old Rectory, (or Old Parsonage) which dates from the 15th century and still exists behind the later building.Tilney, Dinas Powys, St Andrews Major and Michealston-le- Pit From Old Photographs, pages 10, 18.

Reed was the Criminal District Attorney of Bexar County, Texas from 1998 to January 3, 2015. She is a member of the Republican Party. Career Reed was elected District Attorney of Bexar County (San Antonio) in 1998, becoming the first woman to hold the office. She served as Judge of the 144th District Court (San Antonio) from 1986 to 1998. She served as an Assistant District Attorney for Bexar County from 1974 to 1982, including duties as chief prosecutor for court districts 144 and 187. Reed was in private practice from 1982 to 1986, with the firm Soules and Reed, specializing in business litigation. During her tenure as a 144th District Court Judge, she helped create a \\"Gang Unit\\" in the Adult Probation department. As Bexar County District Attorney, she has created a new \\"Elder Fraud Unit\\" and successfully lobbied the Texas Legislature to increase penalties for crimes against the elderly. Reed is a member of the National Advisory Council on Violence Against Women. She was appointed to the Criminal Justice Policy Council for Governor Bill Clements. Later, Governor George W. Bush appointed her to serve on the Governor‚Äôs Juvenile Justice Advisory Board. She continued to serve on that board under Governor Rick Perry.  2014 Midterm Elections  Susan Reed was defeated by Democrat Nicholas \\"Nico\\" LaHood on November 4, 2014 during the midterm elections by a margin of 48 to 51 percent, respectively. Lahood went against Reed back in 2010, but was defeated by a margin of 54-46 percent. LaHood was supported in 2014 by 1.5 million dollars from Thomas J Henry, a personal injury lawyer who had ties to lawyers Reed had indicted for barratry. See Bexar County Elections Department COH reports.  Involvements in the case of Ruben Cantu  The 1985 conviction and 1993 execution of Ruben Cantu were the subject of a series of investigative articles by Houston Chronicle reporter Lise Olsen in 2005 and 2006. In those articles, Olsen claimed to have uncovered evidence that undermined the Cantu conviction. According to Olsen, the jury Forewoman, the then-District Attorney, the trial Judge, the co- defendant, and the surviving victim all expressed misgivings about the outcome of the Cantu case. The only evidence linking Cantu to the crime was the testimony of Juan Moreno, the surviving victim, but he since recanted his testimony, claiming he had felt threatened by police. As the District Attorney, Susan Reed investigated the claims of wrongful conviction in the Cantu case. The investigation was to determine if Moreno should be charged with murder by perjury. Her office concluded that Cantu was justifiably executed in 1993 and that no credible evidence existed to support the witnesses' claims of innocence. The report concluded that Moreno had been induced to change his testimony by those seeking to undermine the integrity of Cantu's conviction. Many of Reed's critics called into question the validity and objectivity of her investigation because, as a state district judge, Susan reviewed one of Cantu's appeals and signed his death warrant.

Born at Bannockburn, near Stirling in Scotland,\\"The creator of the garden of the Golden Gate, San Francisco, John McLaren was born in Bannockburn, Stirlingshire\\", Great Scots in America, tartanday.org and worked as a dairyman before studying horticulture at the Edinburgh Royal Botanical Gardens where he worked as an apprentice gardener's helper. He planted grasses anchoring the beach dunes along the Firth of Forth then emigrated to the United States in 1870 and worked on the George Howard estate in the San Mateo foothills, then on the Leland Stanford estate in Palo Alto and planted trees on the Coyote Point on the shore of the Bay. He was friends with John Muir, and dedicated his life to vigorous advocacy and development of the Golden Gate Park, one of the largest public parks in the world, using considerable political skill in addition to his remarkable gardening skill. Appointed Park Superintendent in 1887, he requested thirty thousand dollars a year for park building. One of John McLaren's stipulations before taking the superintendent job was, \\"There will be no 'Keep off the Grass' signs.\\" His horticultural philosophy was to achieve a natural look, typified in his dislike for statuary, calling them \\"stookies\\" and planting trees and shrubs to hide them. He built two windmills to pump water to his park and had the sweepings from San Francisco streets delivered as fertilizer. When ocean waves and wind piled sand on the west end of the park, he began a forty-year effort to pile branches, clippings and laths on the shore to capture sand and build the great berm that now holds the Great Highway. He had a shrewd and aggressive style of management but was so highly respected that, at the age of 70, he was given lifetime tenure over the park and his salary doubled. An avenue in the Seacliff District of San Francisco was named after him during his lifetime, and he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of California at Berkeley. He is credited with planting two million trees during his lifetime. The McLaren Park in the southern part of San Francisco is named after John McLaren, as is McLaren Lodge in Golden Gate Park, where he lived until his death. East Bay's Tilden Park also has a meadow named after him. A small statue of McLaren was erected in the park which he had hidden away only to be discovered after his death. After his death at the age of 96, McLaren's body lay in state in the San Francisco City Hall Rotunda. Afterwards, the funeral cortege drove his casket through Golden Gate Park as a special honor.  Lithia Park, Ashland, Oregon  The small town of Ashland, Oregon commissioned McLaren to design Lithia Park in 1914, just a few years after the park was initially established in 1908. Still considered the \\"crown jewel\\" of Ashland, the park covers 100 acres (0.4 km¬≤), extending from the center of town (\\"The Plaza\\") up Ashland Creek to the foothills of Mount Ashland. It includes two ponds, a Japanese garden, tennis courts, two public greens, a bandshell (outdoor stage) and miles of hiking trails. The name Lithia comes from the natural mineral water in Ashland, Lithia water. The world-famous Oregon Shakespeare Festival now borders the lower portion of the park. The surrounding watershed, which supplies drinking water and hydroelectricity to the city, also includes miles of mountain biking trails. The park is the start and finish for the annual Spring Thaw mountain biking race for pros and amateurs.  Hanchett Residence Park and Hester Park, San Jose, California  In 1907 land developer Lewis Hanchett hired John McLaren to design Hanchett Residence Park on the former 76 acre Agricultural Park bounded by Race Street, Park Avenue, the Alameda and Hester Avenue. John McLaren is credited with creating San Jose's first Residence park that reflected certain architecture standards, sidewalks, street lamps, wide curved streets and gateway landmarks.\\"The Alameda: The Beautiful Way (Paperback) Paperback.\\" The Alameda: The Beautiful Way (Paperback): 9781424318681: Amazon.com: Books.

Their barracks are at Norton Manor Camp, Norton Fitzwarren near Taunton in Somerset. Tasked as a Commando light infantry unit, 40 Commando (pronounced \\"Forty Commando\\") is capable of a wide range of operational tasks. Personnel regularly deploy outside the United Kingdom on operations or training. Whilst 3 Commando Brigade RM are the principal cold weather warfare formation, personnel are capable of operating in a variety of theatres including tropical jungle, desert or mountainous terrain. The Commando is a regular participant in the annual Brigade cold weather warfare exercise in Norway. The unit's first \\"winter\\" was 1991, until which the unit was nicknamed the \\"Sunshine Commando\\". All personnel will have completed the Commando course at the Commando Training Centre (CTCRM) at Lympstone in Devon, entitling them to wear the green beret, with attached personnel having completed the All Arms Commando Course. History=Formation Early Commando units were all from the British Army but by February 1942, the Royal Marines were asked to organise Commando units of their own, and 6,000 men volunteered.Haskew, pp.48‚Äì49 The first Royal Marines commando unit was formed at Deal in Kent on 14 February 1942 and designated 'The Royal Marine Commando'. Before long it was re-designated RM 'A' Commando. Col J Picton Phillips was the Commanding Officer.Neillands, p. 238 Dieppe Raid The Commando's baptism of fire was at Dieppe on 19 August 1942. In support of the main Canadian assault force, Nos. 3 and 4 (Army) Commandos were to destroy the enemy coastal batteries covering the main landing beaches, whilst No. 40 had selected tasks in the port area and was to be responsible for reinforcements as required. In the pre-dawn run-in the landing craft of No. 3 were fired upon and scattered with the result that only two small parties managed to land, one was overwhelmed, but the other successfully engaged the Berneval battery for some hours before withdrawing.Neillands, p. 245 On the other flank at Varengeville No. 4, under the command of Lord Lovat, carried out what was officially hailed as a 'classic operation of war' and completely destroyed the Hess Battery, successfully withdrawing and re-embarking with prisoners.Neillands, p. 248 Unfortunately, No. 40, when committed to their landing, under well-nigh impossible conditions, suffered severe casualties. Of the 370 officers and men, 76 were lost on the beaches. Among those killed was the Commanding officer (CO), while the second-in-command, Robert Houghton was captured. Italy and the Aegean On return RM 'A' Commando was again re-designated; this time as 40 (RM) Commando. Further training and replenishment was carried out. Once back to full strength it was sent to Sicily in July 1943 and a little later in September saw action at Pizzio. Later that year the Commando was in action in Termoli in October, and in 1944 was embroiled at Anzio. Later service in Yugoslavia and Albania followed by policing duties on Corfu wound up 40's wartime activities. Post-Second World War Following the Second World War, 2 Commando (Nos. 2, 9, 40(RM) and 43(RM)) disbanded leaving 3 Commando Brigade (42(RM), 44(RM) and 45(RM)). To recognise 2 Commando Brigade one of the Commandos was renamed, No44(RM) becoming No40(RM). The Commando was deeply involved in 1947‚Äì1948 Civil War in Palestine acting as the rearguard in the Protectorate, leaving in 1948. It also fought in the Malayan Emergency against anti-colonial fighters of the Malayan National Liberation Army.  Malayan Emergency headhunting / decapitation scandal  In April 1952 a British communist newspaper called The Daily Worker (known today as The Morning Star) published photographs of a marine commando posing with two Dayak recruits holding the decapitated head of suspected Malayan communists. The marine in the photograph was standing outside a hut that bore the sign '40 Commando RM'. An Admiralty spokesman claimed that the decapitation photos were fake and a 'communist trick', however Colonial Secretary Oliver Lyttelton later confirmed to parliament that the photographs were genuine. Lyttelton came to the defence of the Commando, claiming that the decapitations were conducted by specialist Dayak headhunters from Borneo hired by the British military and not the Marines themselves. 1960s The Commando subsequently undertook security duties in Cyprus, Hong Kong and Egypt before moving to Singapore in 1961. It was involved in operations during the confrontation with Indonesia (Borneo) throughout the following decade. Return to UK In 1971 the Commando left Singapore and re-established itself in Seaton Barracks, Crownhill, Plymouth. Over the next decade the Commando found itself deployed to Northern Ireland four times and also undertook an unexpected two-month tour in Cyprus after the 1974 invasion by the Turkish Army. Falklands Conflict In 1982, following the Argentine invasion of the Falkland Islands, the Commando deployed on Operation Corporate. On 21 May the Commando were among the first troops ashore and secured the beachhead at San Carlos. The Unit was subsequently split having two companies attached to the Welsh Guards, preparing to attack Port Stanley, when the Argentine surrender came. 1980s On their return from the Falklands, the Commando spent the rest of the decade involved in a variety of tasks including two Northern Ireland tours to South Armagh, a six-month Peace-Keeping tour in Cyprus and a six-month operational tour in Belize. During the tour in Cyprus, the Commando was awarded the Wilkinson Sword of Peace for the third time. Also during this period, in 1983, the Commando relocated to Norton Manor Camp near Taunton. 1990s In 1991 the Unit undertook its first Norway deployment but found itself undergoing a dramatic climatic change when, due to the Gulf War, it deployed to Northern Iraq to ensure the security of Kurdish refugees. Northern Ireland tours, Norway winter deployments and a major Asia-Pacific Exercise kept the Commando busy through the following years. In November 1993 the unit deployed to West Belfast in support of the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC), returning in May 1994. In 1998 a substantial part of the Commando deployed to the Congo to ensure the safe evacuation of UK nationals from Kinshasa City. Recent history Royal Marines from 40 Commando cross an irrigation ditch in Helmand Province, Afghanistan. Royal Marines from the 40th Commando unit load onto a Landing Craft Utility (LCU) following intensive training in the Kuwaiti Desert. The new millennium saw the Commando deploy to Northern Ireland and on their return they were the first Commando to reorganise under a new structural concept called Commando 21. The Unit deployed in its entirety in January 2003, initially part of the Naval Task Group (NTG) 03 in HMS Ocean, HMS Ark Royal and Royal Fleet Auxiliary ships RFA Sir Galahad and RFA Sir Tristram. The group sailed through the Mediterranean Sea, after a brief stop at Cyprus, continuing through the Suez Canal bound for the Persian Gulf. The United Nations were engaged in diplomatic efforts to avoid the need for military intervention in Iraq, as the Unit was busy rehearsing in the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait for possible operations against Iraq. In March 2003 a coalition force, under the overall command of the United States, entered Iraq. During Operation TELIC 1, the liberation of Iraq, on the night of 20 March 2003, 40 Commando RM, under the command of Lt Col G K Messenger DSO OBE, mounted an amphibious helicopter assault to seize key Iraqi oil infrastructure on the Al-Faw Peninsula. As the first conventional troops on the ground, the strategic significance of the operation was immense and, as the Divisional Main Effort, the assault was supported by a vast array of coalition firepower. The Commando Group's role in the success of the coalition operation in Iraq was pivotal and profound. In a two-week period of intense operations, it secured key oil infrastructure, cleared a large expanse of enemy held terrain, and defeated a major enemy stronghold on the periphery of Basra, killing over 150 Iraqi soldiers and taking 440 prisoners. In 2004 the Unit returned to Iraq as part of a multi-national division peace-support operation. The commandos returned in April 2008 from a tour in the Helmand Province of Afghanistan as part of Operation Herrick. During the tour L-Cpl Matthew Croucher was awarded the George Cross for his action of jumping on a live grenade during a patrol. 40 Cdo returned to Afghanistan in 2010 for Op Herrick 12. They were the last British troops to leave Sangin, described as the \\"deadliest place in Afghanistan\\", after command was handed over to the US Armed Forces. A Company deployed with the UK Response Force Task Group in April 2011. Additional follow up forces were on board RFA Cardigan Bay. They then completed Exercise Red Alligator in October 2013: this trained their skills for the role of the Lead Commando Group. In the autumn of 2017, the Unit spearheaded the UK Military's crisis response (Operation RUMAN) in the Caribbean following the catastrophic damage caused to UK Overseas Territories by record-breaking Atlantic Hurricanes. 40 Commando deployed hundreds of troops to the British Virgin Islands, the Turks and Caicos Islands and Anguilla. Their efforts helped to reassure the affected communities, restore security, fix critical infrastructure and distribute humanitarian aid. 40 Commando are CBRN defense experts, expecting to be the lead unit in the event of a CBRN incident. In 2018 they participated in the annual chemical warfare exercise, Exercise TOXIC DAGGER, on Salisbury Plain involving over 300 military personnel, along with the RAF Regiment, the Royal Marines Band Service for casualty treatment and utilising Defence CBRN Centre expertise.

Miller Electric, has grown from a one-man operation selling products in northeastern Wisconsin to what is today one of the world's largest manufacturers of arc welding and cutting equipment.  Overview  In 1929, Niels Miller designed a small arc welder for \\"stick welding\\" that could operate on the electrical supplies in rural Wisconsin that was lighter and less expensive than the DC rotary units previously available. The first machine was built from recycled scrap steel and coil windings in his basement. In 1935, Miller Electric Mfg. Co. was incorporated. Al Mulder, Miller's sole engineer, invented the world's first high frequency-stabilized AC industrial welder, making AC welding practical for use in factories and construction. Miller Electric developed the Millermatic in 1971, combining the previously separate units of power source and wire feed into one unit, bringing MIG welding within reach of a wider market. In 1993, following the death of the company's heir, Miller Electric was purchased by Illinois Tool Works (ITW), a multi-national company based in Chicago. The company regularly exhibits new products at trade fairs including SEMA. In 2018, this included a demonstration by celebrity welding artist Barbie The Welder.  ITW  Miller Syncrowave 350LX power source ITW had much in common with Miller Electric in terms of business philosophy, and in 1992 it was ranked as one of the 100 \\"Most Admired American Corporations\\" by Fortune magazine.www.millerwelds.com ITW brought to Miller the resource base and global perspective needed to further strengthen the company's position as a world leader in the welding industry.

A screen embedded in the crater protects against drawing in burning particles to clog the interior.

The village is part of the municipality of SintikiKallikratis law Greece Ministry of Interior and hosts a population of 373, according to the 2011 census. The municipal unit has an area of 70.937 km2. Agistro lies near the Greek-Bulgarian border and 10 km from the border crossing of Promachonas. The village main tourist attraction is its steam bath complex, which dates from the Byzantine period. History The gold and silver mines found in the mountain of Agkistro, south of the modern village, are believed to have provided valuable material to the armies of Ancient Macedon and especially to the campaign of Alexander the Great, during the 4th century BC, although in archaeological bibliography the specific location has not been identified as one of the ancient mining sites. The steam bath complex and tower in the village center were erected during the Byzantine period, ca. 950 AD. The latter was later converted into a 20 m high clock tower, possibly during the reign of Emperor Andronikos III Palaiologos (1328‚Äì1341). During Ottoman times the village was known as Tsigkeli (), while the baths were modified for use by the local Ottoman lord and his harem. Additionally the clock tower was used as a jail and place of executions. In a survey of 1877 by the French professor A. Synvet,Archaeology, anthropology, and heritage in the Balkans and Anatolia: the life and times of F.W. Hasluck, 1878-1920, Volume 2; David Shankland; 2004; p.281 the village was home to 200 Greeks; while in a survey of 1905, by the Secretary General of the Bulgarian Exarchate (, Sengelovo), who expressed the Bulgarian point of view, the village was inhabited by 1,536 Bulgarians and had a Bulgarian school,D.M.

When the Balkan Wars ended in 1913, the Greek-Bulgarian border was drawn a few metres north of the village. In the years that followed, due to tensions in Greek-Bulgarian relations, the village was to be found within a military zone. In 1920 the local population was 965. In 1923 a number of refugees arrived from the Pontus region, as part of the population exchange between Greece and Turkey, resulting in a population increase (1,240 in 1928). South of the village lies Rupel Fort, which was part of the Greek line of defense that withstood the German invasion in the spring of 1941, during World War II.ekathimerini.gr Pamper yourself in Serres: Village of Agistro offers steam baths and more .

South Europe, especially Italy, must be considered the principal locality of the species, the forms here flying occurring from May to July in really surprising numbers; maritima flies in great abundance even in dull weather and till night -fall on the southern slopes of the Riviera, near Genoa, Pegli, Savona, etc., transalpina being likewise very common in the southern valleys of the Alps of Ticino, extending into the North Italian plains. Description The wingspan o Zygaena transalpina can reach about .LOT Moths and butterflies The forewings are of a shining bluish green, or of a blue black, with three pairs of carmine-red spots for each wing (in some individuals of both sexes, the spots are only five ). The two spots on the base are oval. The hind wings are carmine red, with a black blue border and a slightly darker fringe. The underside of the forewings is light black blue, usually with the same spots as the top. Technical description and variation (Seitz)  Z. transalpina Esp. (= medicaginis O.; charon, angelicae Boisd.) Very highly coloured: metallic black-blue or -green, with 6 small, widely separated, somewhat black-edged spots. The very bright red hindwing is broadly margined with black. On the underside of forewing all the red spots are merged together in the name- typical form. ‚Äî ab. flava Dziurz. is the (accidental) light-yellow aberration. ‚Äî ab. ferulae Led. [synonym of transalpina ], which occurs in the southern Alps and extends sporadically into Southern Germany, is red and has still smaller spots on the forewing than name-typical transalpina , but is hardly separable from it as a distinct form. ‚Äî In ab. nigricans Oberth. (= brunnea Dziurz.) the red has changed into coffee colour, as in ab. chrysanthemi of filipendulae. ‚Äî boisduvali Costa (= xanthographa Germ.) has yellow spots on the forewing (5 or 6), and a yellow streak or heart-shaped spot on the otherwise black hindwing; South Italy. ‚Äî ab. zickerti Hofm. [ synonym of ssp. xanthographa Germar, [1836] ] is similar to boisduvali, but the hindwing is all black, being without the yellow central spot. Flying sparingly among the preceding. ‚Äî astragali Bkh. (= hippocrepidis Hbn.; angelicae Boisd.) [now subspecies] is of a magnificent vermilion colour, with 6 large spots on the forewing and a narrow marginal band to the hindwing. The forewing below is uniformly vermilion (without separation into spots), with black margin. This is the northern form, which occurs in France, South and Central Germany, and Belgium, being said (probably erroneously) to extend as far as Sweden. ‚Äî Specimens of this form with an abdominal belt are named by Hirschke astragali. ab. cingulata. ‚Äî ab. miltosa Cand.[now subspecies] is founded on a small specimen from La Rochelle in which the spots of the upperside are also confluent. ‚Äî sorrentina Stgr. [ synonym of ssp. xanthographa Germar, [1836] ] resembles boisduvali, but the spots are red, and the spot of the hindwing is often very small; Southern Central Italy (Naples). ‚Äî calabrica Calb. (= spicae Stgr.) [synonym of ssp. xanthographa Germar, [1836] ] is quite black, with very small red spots, the spot of the hindwing being only vestigial, the insect therefore resembling stoechadis; South Italy. ‚Äî maritima Oberth. [ now subspecies] is, like the name-typical form, very bright red, but the black margin of the hindwing is wider and more sinuate; the (6) spots of the forewing below are not confluent; Riviera. ‚Äî italica Dziurz. [ synonym of ssp. collina Burgeff, 1926 ] the same, but has only 5 spots; Northern Italy. ‚Äî Larva green, with black dorsal stripe, and yellow lateral line, above which there are triangular black spots.Pupa black, abdomen greenish white; in a light-yellow cocoon.

They can be distinguished by the color of the apex of the antennae (whitish and are more sharp in Z. transalpina, black in Z. filipendulae).Lepinet Moreover, in Z. transalpina, the spot 6, when present, is clearly separated from stain 5 and even the spot 3 and 4 are more distant than in Z. filipendulae.Natura Mediterraneo Biology Adults are on wing from the end of May to August in one generation per year. The imagines are lively and active insects, taking perhaps quickest to the wing of all the Burnets. They likewise simulate death when suddenly touched, but revive soon and whiz quickly away, the flight being fast. It is an aposematic species because its warning colors signal it as toxic to predators such as birds and lizards. In case of attack it emits a liquid containing cyanide. The larvae feed on the leaves of Hippocrepis comosa and sometimes Coronilla varia and Lotus corniculatus. Larvae can be found from August, after overwintering, to June of the following year.

Their style was a fusion of rock, progressive, and flamenco music and dance. Carmen's first album, Fandangos in Space, is ranked number 46 in the Rolling Stone list of 50 Greatest Prog Rock Albums of All Time. History The group was founded by David Clark Allen, a Mexican/American Californian trained in flamenco guitar. Originally a seven-member band in Los Angeles, the band relocated to London, England, in January 1973, where the personnel soon stabilized as a quintet. In London, they became friendly with several rock stars of the time, including David Bowie - who introduced them internationally by including them on his Midnight Special '1984 Floor Show', Marc Bolan (Paul Fenton became his studio and tour drummer), and Bryan Ferry. Obtaining the services of producer Tony Visconti, Carmen released three albums: Fandangos in Space (1973), Dancing on a Cold Wind (1974), and The Gypsies (1975). By early 1975, the band was enjoying its greatest success, playing as an opening act at concerts by Santana, Blue √ñyster Cult, and Electric Light Orchestra, and touring for three months as the opener for Jethro Tull. A series of unfortunate events then occurred while the group was recording The Gypsies at Longview Farm. Paul Fenton seriously damaged his knee, stopping his career as a drummer for many years. Carmen and Tony Visconti ended their musical relationship, and the band's manager left. Carmen disbanded shortly after finishing their last album in 1975 and John Glascock went on to join Jethro Tull. Music Carmen's stage performances featured Amaral and Angela Allen dancing on a specially amplified stage floor, so that their flamenco zapateado became an integral percussive addition to the music. Spanish influences in their sound included acoustic guitar interludes in flamenco style, occasional Spanish lyrics, themes of betrayed love reminiscent of Federico Garc√≠a Lorca, and castanets, all supported by a traditional rock rhythm section. Further careers=David Clark Allen David Clark Allen continued to pursue a music career after Carmen disbanded. He played guitar on Michelle Phillip's solo album produced by Jack Nitzsche and was managed by Herb Cohen during the late 70s. He wrote two songs (Shame and Stay) for Agnetha's solo album, Wrap Your Arms Around Me - produced by Mike Chapman and a single release by Swedish band Katz - Heart Beats Stronger. David was diagnosed with thyroid/throat cancer in the early 80s. After a successful operation and radioactive therapy, he changed his name to Housk Randall - and became a sexual anthropologist/photographer. As Housk he had 5 books published in 4 languages: Revelations, Rituals of Love, The Customised Body, Piercing, Radical Desire and Bizarre Rubber - a photographic fantasy catalogue for fetish designers DeMask. In 1996 he married, changed his name to David Randall-Goddard and established a successful family photographic studio Family Portraits. For the 2006 reissue of Carmen's three albums by Angelair, David produced an instrumental album Widescreen with remixer/producer Larry Lush. Widescreen became the name of the band David then formed with Larry. They opened for The Buena Vista Social Club, Ojos de Brujo, Eliades Ochoa and were regular performers on the festival circuit in England for many years. Widescreen eventually morphed into Flamexicano which disbanded in 2013. David then formed an Americana/Latino roots rock band, Papa Tigre which disbanded in 2015. David next completed 2 1/2 years work/study at IMW recording studios/Islington College - qualifying as a recording engineer/producer. Academia has proved exciting to David, who having recently gained a Masters in Creative Practice from Goldsmith's University, is now hot on the trail of a PHD. John Glascock Glascock joined Jethro Tull in 1975, and Angela Allen, his romantic partner at the time, contributed backing vocals on Tull's recording Too Old to Rock 'n' Roll: Too Young to Die!. Their relationship ended shortly after, and in 1979, at the age of 28, Glascock died due to complications caused by a congenital heart condition. Angela Allen Angela Allen has relocated back to Los Angeles. She contributed vocals for the Widescreen album. Paul Fenton Paul Fenton was badly injured in a fall from a horse around the time of Carmen's break-up. He had already built a career for himself as a drummer outside of Carmen, in particular working with Marc Bolan's T. Rex; later, he went on to form and play in a Bolan tribute band that included many of the original members of T.Rex. He continues to tour the world with this group - as drummer and de facto manager. Roberto Amaral Roberto Amaral, who currently resides in Van Nuys, California, has continued to create music as a singer, songwriter and producer. At the same time, he has established himself as the leading Flamenco teacher/choreographer from his own studio in Southern California. After over 40 years, his dance companies, including Ballet Espanol de Los Angeles, Fuego Flamenco and Espana clasica, continue to receive public and critical acclaim. He collaborated on the book and composed the musical score for an original stage play incorporating Flamenco dance. He has also formed a music publishing company called Delicia Music. Discography The first two albums were re-issued by Angel Air records as a 2-CD set in October 2006. Carmen's third album The Gypsies was re-issued by Angel Air records in May 2007, also as a 2-CD set; the second CD, entitled Widescreen, contains new instrumental music by David Clark Allen.A review of this 2 CD set is available here.

A breastplate (used interchangeably with breastcollar, breaststrap and breastgirth) is a piece of riding equipment used on horses. Its purpose is to keep the saddle or harness from sliding back. On riding horses, it is most helpful on horses with large shoulders and a flat ribcage. It is also a safety feature, especially on cross-country, should a rider's girth or billets break, as the rider will have enough time to stop the horse and dismount before the saddle slipped off the animal's back or underneath its belly. The breastplate is used on both English and Western saddles. When used in English riding, the hunting breastplate is made of thinner straps of leather, as is the western style used for horse shows. Working western horses in disciplines that involve work with cattle use a thicker, sturdier style.  History  When the Spanish Conquistador Cortez invaded Mexico in 1519 his small group of cavalry men all rode the old centerfire rigged War Saddle. Since the saddle was prone to slip back on the horse, a breast collar was used, usually with a shoulder strap to hold it up. And, a crupper under the horse‚Äôs tail and attached to the saddle was also required to maintain stability. From the formation of the American cavalry in 1812 military saddles were single cinched and both a breast collar and crupper were used. Many Civil War photos show horses rigged with these pieces of equipment. It wasn‚Äôt until the McClellan saddle was adapted that they were discarded. Early Mexican vaqueros soon moved the front cinch forward, hanging the rigging directly under the fork, and solved the problem of saddle slippage. The un-needed breast collar was discarded, probably because it would catch on limbs when chasing a cow through brush. Both North American cowboys and South American gauchos followed their example and breast collars were seldom seen. The Texas development of the full double rigging in the early 1800‚Äôs added even more saddle security. Only on the Pacific Coast and Nevada ranges did the centerfire rigging remain popular. A martingale of the time (a leather loop around the horse‚Äôs neck with an additional strap down to the cinch) helped stabilize the saddle in addition to being a fashion accent. The rise of contest roping in the early 1900‚Äôs returned the breast collar to popularity. While the first generation of contest hands didn‚Äôt use one, those that followed learned that a breast collar was necessary. It not only kept the saddle in place during a hard start but was a ‚Äúplus‚Äù when they laid their slack behind a 900 pound steer and rode by for the trip. It was also a handy place to tuck up the 2nd rope that they carried. The calf ropers and steer wrestlers quickly followed by example. By 1940, the majority of timed event contestants used a breast collar. Harness The breastcollar harness is one of two standard harness designs, the other being the collar and hames design. The breastcollar harness is used to pull light loads, such as at horse shows and for harness racing. It can only be used for lighter loads because it places the weight of the load on the sternum of the horse, which is not suitable for heavy pulling, plus it can put pressure on the windpipe and reduce a horse's air supply. breastcollar The hunting or stockman's breastplate A pony wearing a hunting breastplate. Note where it attaches to the D-rings of the saddle. Being the classic breastplate for English riding, campdrafting or stockwork, the stockman's or hunting breastplate is the most common type. It consists of a yoke (with a neck and wither strap), a breast strap at the bottom of the yoke which runs through the horse's front legs and attaches to the girth, and two straps at the top of the yoke which attach to the D-rings of a saddle. There are usually buckles for adjusting the size of the yoke as well as the length of the straps which attach to the saddle and girth. The hunting breastplate not only helps to prevent the saddle from slipping, but also may be used to attach a Market Harborough or standing and running martingales, which are clipped or buckled onto a ring at the chest. The hunting breastplate is most commonly made of leather, and some have elastic inserts on the yoke to help prevent it from restricting the horse's shoulders. Those used in endurance riding are commonly made of lightweight nylon or another synthetic material. The hunting breastplate is worn by endurance horses, show hunters, fox hunters, equitation horses, eventers (it can be seen used in all three phases), and show jumpers. It is also occasionally see in flat racing, as well as steeplechase. Disadvantages Because the hunting breastplate is attached to the D-rings of the saddle (which are known to be pulled out under great pressure), it is not as reliable as equipment attached to the saddle by means of the billets. Therefore, the breastcollar is sometimes preferred on cross-country. The hunting breastplate also tends to have a restrictive effect on the shoulder, even when correctly fitted. Additionally, a hunting breastplate may cause the tree points of a poorly fitting saddle to dig into the sides of the horse's withers, creating rubs and great discomfort. In this case, it is best to get the saddle properly fitted before using a hunting breastplate. Western styles A western style breastplate, usually referred to as a breast collar The variation of a breastplate used for western riding is referred to as a breast collar. The term \\"breastplate\\" is occasionally used, though western riders generally use \\"breast collar\\" to refer to both designs. A working western breast collar may be of either a breastplate or breastcollar design. attach to the d-rings that hold the latigochiefly Western US. : a long strap on a saddletree of a western saddle to adjust the cinch. of the cinch, while one suitable for a horse show may attach to decorative dees located above the cinch rings, nearer the swells of the saddle. In either case, an additional strap usually runs between the front legs and attaches to the cinch. Some, though not all breastcollars for western riding also have a wither strap. Fitting The breastplate should not be fitted in any way that will restrict the horse's movement. Special attention should be paid to the shoulders, chest, and the area between the horse's front legs. In general, a fist should fit between breastplate and the horse's chest, and there should be a hand's width between the wither strap and the withers. The breast strap should be have some slack, and care should be taken that its buckle doesn't rub the sensitive skin in the area. It should also be adjusted so that the chest straps lie above the point of the shoulder so that the horse's motion is not restricted. The breastcollar or polo breastplate This racehorse wears a breastcollar The breastcollar consists of a chest strap, which buckles to one billet of the saddle, runs around the horse's chest, and attaches to the first billet on the other side. It also has a wither strap, which is used to adjust the height of the breastcollar, and prevents it from slipping down too far. The breastcollar is often made of leather, strong elastic, or webbing. The breastcollar is more secure than the hunting breastplate, because it attaches to either the front billet of the saddle, or to the front branch of a split-end girth (which is even more secure). It is therefore most desirable in eventing, especially on the cross- country phase, polo, and other jumping disciplines. It is not used in dressage, hunt seat, or equitation. This style of breastcollar does not interfere with the horse's shoulders, as some other styles can do. However, this style may interfere with the horse's ability to breathe when it puts its head far down. Thus, this style is not desirable for jumping and riding in steep terrain. Disadvantages * Tends to restrict the shoulders more so than other breastplates. Fitting The breastcollar should be fitted so the chest strap is horizontal from chest to girth. The wither strap should be adjusted so that it is not so low that it interferes with the horse's shoulders, or so high that it presses against the animal's windpipe. As a general rule, a fist should fit between the wither strap of the breastcollar and the withers, and the chest strap and the chest of the horse. Breastgirth or loop breastplate A breastgirth. The breastgirth is made of strong elastic, and runs from either the D-rings of the saddle, or is attached to a loop that runs around the saddle's stirrup bars. Although similar to the breastcollar, there is no wither strap. Breastcollars are usually seen in show jumping and eventing (usually on the cross-country phase). They are desirable because they tend to be less-restrictive to the shoulders, so the horse is better able to pick up his front legs and fold over a jump. Fitting If the breastgirth is not adjusted correctly, it will restrict the horse's breathing because it will press on the windpipe. Additionally, it is not as secure as the breastcollar when it is attached to the D-rings. The breastgirth should be adjusted so it does not restrict the horse's breathing. It should cross at the base of the neck, and may be adjusted snugly.

He also appears in various comics and novels, and is featured in the Disney theme park attractions, the Indiana Jones Adventure and The Great Movie Ride. Character Sallah is a hefty, bearded Egyptian excavator. He lives in Cairo and is a close friend of Indiana Jones. He is a dedicated family man with a wife named Fayah and nine children, all of whom seem to have a fondness for Indiana (at one point they all surround him to save him from a group of Nazis who have their guns drawn on him). Sallah is portrayed in Raiders of the Lost Ark as being jovial, good-natured, and occasionally cowardly (when seeing numerous snakes inside the Well of souls, the room that houses the Ark of the Covenant, he suggests to Indiana, \\"You go first\\"), although unlike Indy, Sallah isn't afraid of snakes. Like Marcus Brody, Sallah's portrayal in The Last Crusade has changed into a bumbling stereotype who for example, calls a tank a \\"Steel Beast\\". He seems to be extremely strong, although he is apparently unaware of his enormous strength (at one point, he gives Indiana a bear hug, causing him a great deal of discomfort, probably because Indy had just been shot in the arm). He has a strong baritone voice and he seems to have an affinity for Gilbert and Sullivan. He is often seen singing tunes from H.M.S. Pinafore when he is in a good mood. In Raiders, he is mostly seen wearing a turban (perhaps to blend in with the other diggers working for the Nazis), and in Last Crusade, he is seen wearing a fez. Appearances Sallah appears in Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), where he helps Jones decipher the inscription on the back of Marion Ravenwood's medallion by taking him to an old wise man who is also a friend of his. They learn that the Nazis are digging in the wrong location for the Ark of the Covenant‚Äîdue to them only having access to one side of the medallion‚Äîso Sallah and Jones infiltrate the Nazi dig and they discover the real location of the Well of Souls, where the Ark is kept. He reluctantly joins Jones in the snake-infested tomb, and they move the Ark to the surface. However, the Nazis discover the secret dig and capture the Ark and Sallah. They also throw Marion into the tomb with Jones, and seal it shut. Jones and Marion escape, however, and he tells Sallah to secure some transportation back to England. He makes a deal with the captain of the Bantu Wind, a tramp steamer, for bringing Jones, Marion, and the Ark back to the States, referring to the two of them as his family. He reappeared in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989), where he fails in stopping Marcus Brody from being captured by the Nazis at ƒ∞skenderun. Sallah later takes Jones and his father, Henry to the Nazi convoy near the location of the Holy Grail. He borrows his brother-in-law's car, which is destroyed in the ensuing battle between the Nazis and the Grail's guardians. Indy tells Sallah \\"no camels\\" and Sallah takes horses from the killed guardians for the return trip, as well as camels to compensate for his brother-in-law's loss. At the film's end, Sallah inquires what \\"Junior\\" means, and Henry Jones Sr. explains that it is his name: \\"Henry Jones, Jr.\\". Indiana (who apparently does not like his given name) reveals that he nicknamed himself \\"Indiana\\" after his dog, leaving Sallah roaring with laughter. Sallah appeared in Marvel Comics's The Further Adventures of Indiana Jones, where he helps Indiana recover the Chachapoyan Fertility Idol in Marrakech (that Rene Belloq stole in the Raiders opening sequence). The 1990 novel Young Indiana Jones and the Tomb of Terror details his first encounter with Indiana in 1913, and his full name is given as Sallah Mohammed Faisel el-Kahir. Sallah reappeared in the ninth and twelfth Bantam Books novels set before the films: in 1933 Sallah helped Indiana find the philosopher's stone, and the following year he provides sanctuary for Jones on his way to the Great Sphinx of Giza. Concept and creation The script specified Sallah as a thin 5'2\\" Bedouin, while Steven Spielberg envisioned him as \\"a small creature from the Star Wars cantina in an earthbound adventure film\\". He offered the role to Danny DeVito, who passed because of his commitment to Taxi. Spielberg saw John Rhys-Davies in Sh≈çgun, and changed the role accordingly, advising the actor portray Sallah as a cross between his role in Sh≈çgun and Falstaff. Kevork Malikyan, who played Kazim in Last Crusade, also expressed interest in the role, but a traffic jam caused him to miss his audition. When Davies reprised his role for Last Crusade, he imagined Sallah had become richer since Raiders, leaving excavation in favor of selling antiques. He wanted to convey that Sallah \\"has gotten older and a little fatter. This time, we see him without the appurtenances of his wife and children. He's a little more resolute now, and he's more ready to have a physical go at the Germans himself. But other than that, he's still the same old Sallah\\". There are two scenes deleted during filming of Raiders of the Lost Ark featuring Sallah. One is an extension of the scene where Sallah loses the rope into the map room, after two Nazi soldiers demand help from him in freeing their truck from the sand. The entire scene also involved several Nazi soldiers demanding to be served water, while Sallah panics and spills water on their uniforms. The scene was supposed to have smoke in the background, but tires used in the scene made it too dark. Spielberg cut the scene to avoid spending half a day reshooting. The other scene depicted Sallah's fate after Jones and Marion's entrapment with the asps. The Germans decide to execute Sallah, but a young soldier put in charge of the operation has second thoughts. There were also two scenes featuring Sallah cut from the finished cut of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. During the scene where Sallah fends off the German kidnappers, he hits a camel which spits mucus over the Nazis, and another shot with Sallah fighting the Nazis. The other depicts Indy and his father meeting Sallah at the ƒ∞skenderun train station. It was deleted because of showing a minor transitional plot element. Reception Sallah ranks at number 47 on Entertainment Weekly's list of the best sidekicks. They recalled his line, \\"Asps, very dangerous ‚Äì you go first\\", citing it as \\"not the words of a coward, but rather, of a faithful (and perfectly honest) companion\\". Empire named him their thirtieth favorite element of the films, citing \\"his indomitable spirit\\", a \\"lovely singing voice\\" and \\"a roguish streak to match Indy‚Äôs own\\". Kenner released a 3.75\\" action figure in 1983. He was included in a TSR, Inc. collection of metal miniatures the following year. In 2008, Hasbro released a 3 ¬æ\\" Sallah figure that included shovel and a torch accessories. An Adventure Heroes figurine, which comes with a cobra and a mummy, was also released.

Additionally, through a partnership with service and hearing dog organization Paws With A Cause, dogs unsuited for the work of their respective programs may be \\"career changed\\" to another program.  History  In the summer of 1938, the Uptown Detroit Lions Club members gathered to discuss the future of Dr. Glenn Wheeler, a blind man who had shown interest in obtaining a personal guide dog. They decided to pay all of the expenses for the man and contacted the only school in America at the time for guide dogs, The Seeing Eye. The club was turned down because of the schools policy, which stated that individuals could not be sponsored by clubs or organizations, but that the contributions must go into the school as a whole, to be used where needed. This was an initial setback. However, the Lions Club members did find individual trainers of dogs, one in particular named Glen Staines, who trained Doberman Pinchers. He was hired on October 6, 1938 to train as many as four dogs for a price of eight hundred dollars. If students could not be found, then the agreement would be terminated, and the Lions Club would have to keep two of the dogs. They did find four students: Dr. Wheeler, Earl Morrey, William Joyce, and Paul Brown. After hearing about the cause, the Park Avenue Hotel in downtown Detroit offered free accommodations for the students learning to handle their dogs. Soon the club needed a name for their mounting project. They had dogs, a trainer, students, and a place to house these students, something they had not even imagined. To find a suitable name, a four-page report was sent out to every single member of Lions International. Over 500 names were sent back as suggestions. \\"Lions Leader\\" was the name selected, and printed in the newspapers on December 14, 1938. In February 1939, all four Doberman Pinchers were placed with their new owners. The club wanted to expand their help beyond the actual club, and on April 4, 1939 the \\"Lion's Leader Dog Foundation\\" was initiated. To get the new school off the ground, an actual facility was needed. A small farm in Rochester Hills, Michigan was selected. On the property were a house, a barn, and a small garage, which were all rented for fifty dollars a month. The name was changed to \\"Leader Dog League for the Blind\\" in 1940, and during the first year eighteen dogs were placed with blind students. Despite many hardships, the school stayed open and was helped tremendously by the number of blind veterans returning from World War II. The blind were requesting dogs for their new lives and businesses began to hire the blind, as it was discovered that many blind could carry on normal jobs. The United States government eventually promised federal funds to all guide dog schools and these schools began to pop up everywhere around the country. To date, Leader Dogs for the Blind has paired over 14,000 dogs with the visually impaired and continues to serve clients around the world. See also *List of Guide Dog Schools References 2\\\\.
