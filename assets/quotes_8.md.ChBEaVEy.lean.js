The work has been compared to the philosopher Gilles Deleuze and the psychoanalyst F√©lix Guattari's Anti-Oedipus (1972). Critics have argued that the work lacks a moral or political orientation. Lyotard subsequently abandoned its views and developed an interest in postmodernism. Summary Lyotard explores the psychoanalytic concept of the libido, and the relation of libido to the human body and human behavior. He also discusses the work of authors such as the philosophers Karl Marx and Friedrich Nietzsche, Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis, and the linguist Ferdinand de Saussure. He also discusses and criticizes the work of the psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan, Deleuze and Guattari, and the sociologist Jean Baudrillard; he points out both similarities and differences between his work and that of Baudrillard. Publication history Libidinal Economy was first published in 1974 by Les √âditions de Minuit. In 1993, it was published in the philosopher Iain Hamilton Grant's English translation by Indiana University Press. Reception Commentators have compared Libidinal Economy to Deleuze and Guattari's Anti- Oedipus. The philosopher Peter Dews argues that Libidinal Economy, while part of a phase of Lyotard's thought less well-known than Anti-Oedipus in the English-speaking world, is important for its \\"treatment of the problem of the appropriate reaction to the erosion of the traditional\\" caused by \\"the incessant expansion of capitalist economic relations\\"; he also praises Lyotard's critique of Lacan. However, he argues that because Lyotard rejects Deleuze and Guattari's idea of opposing \\"good\\" revolutionary desire to \\"bad\\" fascist desire, Libidinal Economy is \\"bereft of any political or moral orientation\\". He notes that Lyotard subsequently rejected ideas he had advocated in the book, in order to discuss a \\"post-modern concept of justice\\", arguing that this could be considered an attempt by Lyotard to \\"make amends\\" for its \\"implicit amoralism\\". Dews suggestes that Lyotard too quickly rejected the perspective advanced in the work. The philosopher Douglas Kellner writes that Libidinal Economy and Anti-Oedipus were both key texts in the \\"micropolitics of desire\\" advocated by some French intellectuals in the 1970s; according to Kellner, the \\"micropolitics of desire\\" advocates revolutionary change in practices of everyday life as a way of providing \\"the preconditions for a new society\\". He contrasts Lyotard's views with those of Baudrillard, noting that the latter eventually abandoned the \\"micropolitics of desire\\". Grant compares Libidinal Economy to the philosopher Jacques Derrida's Of Grammatology (1967), the philosopher Luce Irigaray's Speculum of the Other Woman (1974), and Baudrillard's Symbolic Exchange and Death (1976), as well as to Anti-Oedipus, noting that like them it forms part of post-structuralism, a response to the demise of structuralism as a dominant intellectual discourse. He writes that the book is less well-known than Derrida's work, and that Dews's critique of it reflects a widespread view of it, that it drew a hostile response from Marxists, and that Lyotard himself was subsequently critical of it. However, he also notes that Lyotard is reported as having seen it as one of his key works, alongside Discourse, Figure (1971) and The Differend (1983). Simon Malpas suggests that the book is Lyotard's most important early work available in English translation, crediting Lyotard with providing \\"fascinating discussions of Freud, Marx and capitalism.\\" He observes that as of 1993, the book was generating increasing interest among critics who have given attention to the work Lyotard produced before becoming interested in postmodernism. Anthony Elliott argues that Lyotard's ideas are problematic from the standpoint of critical psychoanalytic theory, and involve questionable assumptions about human subjectivity and agency. In his view, Lyotard's \\"celebration of the energetic component of the unconscious is achieved at the cost of displacing the vital role of representation in psychic life\\" and his contention that representation is a local effect of libidinal intensities \\"erases the fundamental stress upon representation in Freud's interpretation of the self.\\" Endorsing Dews's criticism of the work, he concludes that Lyotard's concept of libidinal intensities is not useful for \\"critical social analysis\\". The philosopher Alan D. Schrift writes that Libidinal Economy reflects the passion surrounding the events of May 1968 in France, as well as disappointment with the Marxist response to those events.

The British captured her in the Mediterranean in 1796 and she served briefly there before being laid up in 1797 and sold in 1798. French service and capture Utile was launched in early 1784 at Bayonne. In August 1793 an Anglo-Spanish force captured Toulon and Royalist forces turned over to them the French naval vessels in the port. When the Anglo-Spanish force had to leave in December, they took with them the best vessels and tried to burn the remainder. In November and December 1794 she was at Toulon undergoing repairs and refitting. She was to be renamed Zibeline in 1795, but apparently she retained her original name. Around midday of 9 June 1796, Admiral John Jervis, Commander- in-Chief of the British Fleet in the Mediterranean, called Captain James Macnamara of the frigate on board his ship Victory, and pointed out a French corvette that was working her way up among the Hy√®res islands. Jervis then directed Macnamara \\"to make a Dash at her\\". Macnamara immediately set out, sailing the Grande Passe, or passage between the islands of Porquerolles and Port-cros. That evening Southampton captured Utile by boarding, with Lieutenant Charles Lydiard at the head of the boarding party. Utile was armed with twenty-four 6-pounder guns and was under the protection of a battery. She had a crew of 136 men under the command of Citizen Fran√ßois Veza. The French put up a resistance during which they suffered eight killed, including Veza, and 17 wounded; Southampton had one man killed. It was not until early the next morning that Southampton and Utile were finally able to get out of range of the guns of Fort de Br√©gan√ßon. , , and the hired armed cutter Fox were in company at the time, and with the British fleet outside Toulon.

The term was introduced in the case of Whelan v. Jaslow in 1986. The method of comparing the SSO of two software products has since evolved in attempts to avoid the extremes of over- protection and under-protection, both of which are considered to discourage innovation. More recently, the concept has been used in Oracle America, Inc. v. Google, Inc. Whelan v. Jaslow Whelan Assocs., Inc. v. Jaslow Dental Laboratory, Inc. was a landmark case in defining principles that applied to copyright of computer software. Whelan had developed software for Jaslow to manage the operations of a dental laboratory, and later took it to market under the trade name Dentalab. Jaslow became engaged in selling the Dentalab software. He later formed a new company named Dentcom and wrote a program in a different computer language but with similar functionality that he called Dentlab, marketing it as a Dentalab successor. Whelan filed a suit in federal court in Pennsylvania alleging that the Dentlab software violated Whelan's copyrights in the Dentalab software. Whelan won the case and was awarded damages on the basis that Dentlab had substantially similar structure and overall organization. The district court ruling in Whelan drew on the established doctrine that even when the component parts of a work cannot be copyrightable, the structure and organization of a work may be. The court also drew support from the 1985 SAS Inst. Inc. v. S&H; Computer Sys. Inc. in which it had been found that copyright protected organizational and structural details, not just specific lines of source or object code. Sequence, structure and organization (SSO) in this case was defined as \\"the manner in which the program operates, controls and regulates the computer in receiving, assembling, calculating, retaining, correlating, and producing useful information.\\" SSO refers to non-literal elements of computer programs that include \\"data input formats, file structures, design, organization and flow of the code, screen outputs or user interfaces, and the flow and sequencing of the screens.\\". However, the SAS Inst. Inc. V. S&H; Computer Sys. Inc. demonstrated that copyright can exist in derived works from publicly funded developed source code in the public domain S & H COMPUTER SYSTEMS v. SAS Institute, Inc., 568 F. Supp. 416 - Dist. Court, MD Tennessee 1983 rather than address the issue of SSO. Jaslow appealed the decision. The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit noted that computer programs are literary works under U.S. law. The court reasoned that with literary works a non-literal element is protected to the extent that it is an expression of an idea rather than the idea itself. By analogy, the purpose or function of a software work would be the work's \\"idea\\", while everything not necessary to that purpose or function would be part of the expression of the idea. The expression would be protected, although the basic purpose or function would not. On this basis the Court of Appeals upheld the district court's ruling of copyright violation due to similarity of SSO. Early adoption and criticism For the next few years most, but not all, circuit courts accepted the Whelan decision on SSO in one form or another. This resulted in a period of tight protection for software, since almost everything other than the broad purpose of a software work would be protected. The only exception was where the functionality could only be achieved in a very small number of ways. In these cases there could be no protection due to the merger doctrine, which applies when the expression and the idea are inextricably merged. In one case a court found that a defendant had infringed the right to prepare a derivative work when they copied the sequence, structure, and organization of the plaintiff's file formats, screen, reports, and transaction codes, even though different data fields were present. In 1986 the ruling in Broderbund Software, Inc v. Unison World, Inc appeared to prevent software developers from marketing products with the same or similar user interfaces, regardless of whether there was anything in common in the underlying code. In the 1990 case of Lotus v. Paperback the U.S. District Court for Massachusetts decided that Paperback's VP-Planner software violated the copyright of Lotus's 1-2-3 spreadsheet program since it had the same user interface, even though the underlying code was completely different. A technical criticism of Whelan is that it fails to distinguish between the sequence in which instructions are presented in the text of a program and the sequence in which the instructions are executed - the program's behavior. Both the textual and behavioral aspects have their own SSO, but a programmer would see the textual SSO as relatively unimportant. A related point is that although the text of a computer program may be an \\"original work of authorship\\", protected by copyright laws, the algorithms and designs that the program embodies may be better considered to be \\"processes, procedures, systems, methods of operation\\", which are explicitly excluded from copyright protection although they may be protectable by patents. The distinction between the code's SSO, which is protected by copyright, and the protocol or algorithm, which is patentable, is however extremely difficult to maintain. The Whelan ruling has been criticized as being \\"dangerously broad\\". By saying that the purpose of the program was to assist a Dental lab operation, and that anything not essential to that purpose was an expression, it left open a wide range of functions that could be deemed \\"not essential\\" and therefore subject to protection. In the 1988 Healthcare Affiliated Services, Inc. v. Lippany the court took a position more in line with the idea-expression merger concept, saying that the defendant's choice of scope, variables to be used and other aspects of what its software would do did not constitute the SSO. In 1987 the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit rejected the extension of copyright protection to the non-literal elements of computer programs in the case of Plains Cotton Cooperative Ass'n v. Goodpasture Computer Serv. The court held that input formats were idea rather than expression and refused to extend protection to these formats. The court said: \\"We decline to embrace Whelan.\\" Computer Associates v. Altai In Computer Associates Int. Inc. v. Altai Inc. in 1992 the Second Circuit Court of Appeals agreed with the conclusion in Whelan that the structure, sequence and organization of a program might by protected by copyright where appropriate. However, the court went on to say, \\"As we have already noted, a computer program's ultimate function or purpose is the composite result of interacting subroutines. Since each Subroutine is itself a program, and thus, may be said to have its own 'idea,' Whelan's general formulation that a program's overall Purpose equates with the program's idea is descriptively inadequate.\\" The Second Circuit introduced the three-step Abstraction-Filtration-Comparison test, and several other circuits later adopted this test. In the abstraction step the court identifies similarities starting from the object and source code and moving up to higher levels of abstraction. In the filtration step any legitimate similarities are discarded. Elements removed in this step include obvious expressive interpretations of broad ideas, elements dictated by efficiency or external considerations, elements in the public domain and industry standards. In the comparison step the court decides whether there is enough similarity between the remaining elements to constitute infringement, and if so the severity of the infringement. One effect of the Altai case may have been that companies that thought they were protected under Whelan, and had therefore not filed patent applications, now found themselves exposed. The Altai case may have gone too far, in effect removing protection from all but the literal elements of a program and thus leading to underprotection. Aware of this risk, many courts that followed the Altai ruling seem to have in practice performed less filtration than was required by the test. However, most circuits have accepted Altai in preference to Whelan. Later decisions Both the code and the \\"look and feel\\" of a software product have structure, sequence and organization. Technically there is little or no connection between the two. The same look and feel can be created by entirely different software products, and two internally very similar software products may present very different look and feel. However, the courts have tried to maintain common standards and tests for both types of SSO. Following the 1986 Broderbund ruling, Lotus Development Corporation sued two competing spreadsheet program vendors for copying the look and feel of their Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet program, and Apple Computers sued Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard for copying the Macintosh operating system's use of icons, pull-down menus and a mouse pointing device. Both companies drew criticism, since key elements of their look and feel had been introduced earlier by VisiCalc and Xerox. A 1992 federal court finding against Apple largely rejected the idea that copyright law could protect look and feel. The Lotus case went to the Supreme Court, which could not reach a decision, thus by default confirming the lower court's 1995 declaration that the words and commands used to manipulate the spreadsheet were a \\"method of operation\\", which is not subject to copyright. Only patent law can protect the behavior of a computer program. Competitors may create programs that provide essentially the same functionality as a protected program as long as they do not copy the code. The trend has been for courts to say that even if there are non-literal SSO similarities, there must be proof of copying. Some relevant court decisions allow for reverse-engineering to discover ideas that are not subject to copyright within a protected program. The ideas can be implemented in a competing program as long as the developers do not copy the original expression. With a clean room design approach one team of engineers derives a functional specification from the original code, and then a second team uses that specification to design and build the new code. This was piloted in the mid-1980s by a team from Phoenix Technologies to produce a BIOS functionally equivalent to that of the IBM Personal Computer without infringing on IBM's copyright. In August 2010 Oracle Corporation initiated a lawsuit against Google claiming a combination of patent and copyright violations related to Google's implementation of the Java programming language in Google's Android operating system. On May 7, 2012 a jury decided that Google had infringed the SSO copyright of 37 Java Application programming interface (API) packages, but were unable to decide whether this was fair use. The judge asked both Google and Oracle to provide further detail of their positions over whether an API or a programming language such as Java can be copyrighted. He also asked for both sides to comment on a ruling by the European Court of Justice in a similar case that found \\"Neither the functionality of a computer program nor the programming language and the format of data files used in a computer program in order to exploit certain of its functions constitute a form of expression. Accordingly, they do not enjoy copyright protection.\\" On May 31, 2012 the judge ruled that \\"So long as the specific code used to implement a method is different, anyone is free under the Copyright Act to write his or her own code to carry out exactly the same function or specification of any methods used in the Java API.\\" In reviewing the Oracle v.

Jaslow Dental Laboratory, Inc. (3rd Cir. 1986) was a landmark case in defining principles that applied to copyright of computer software in the United States, extending beyond literal copying of the text to copying the more abstract structure, sequence and organization. The decision initiated a six-year period (until Computer Associates Int. Inc. v. Altai Inc.) of excessive copyright protection, suppressing innovation. Background of the case In 1978 Rand Jaslow tried to build a computer program to handle customer management, billing, accounting, inventory management and other functions for Jaslow Dental Laboratories. He gave up after a few months and hired Strohl Systems to do the job. The software was built by the half-owner of Strohl, Elaine Whelan, and delivered in March 1979. It was written in the EDL language and ran on an IBM Series/1 minicomputer. Strohl kept ownership of the software, which was branded Dentalab, and could license it to other companies in exchange for a 10% commission to Jaslow. In November 1979 Whelan left Strohl and set up her own business, acquiring the right to the software. Later, Jaslow became engaged in selling the Dentalab software in exchange for a percentage of the gross sales. He formed a company named Dentcom which in late 1982 began to develop a program in a different computer language (BASIC) but with very similar functionality called Dentlab, marketed as a Dentalab successor. The new software could run on IBM Personal Computers, giving access to a broader market. On 30 June 1983 Jaslow's company filed a suit in Pennsylvania state court alleging that Whelan had misappropriated its trade secrets. Whelan filed a countersuit in federal court in Pennsylvania alleging that the Dentlab software violated Whelan's copyrights in the Dentalab software. The district court ruled that Dentlab was substantially similar to Dentalab because its structure and overall organization were substantially similar. Jaslow appealed the decision to the U.S. Third Circuit Court of Appeals. Relevant law The district court ruling in the Whelan case drew on the established doctrine that even when the component parts of a work cannot be copyrightable, the structure and organization of a work may be. The court also drew support from the 1985 SAS Inst. Inc. v. S&H; Computer Sys. Inc. in which it had been found that copyright protected organizational and structural details, not just specific lines of code. Structure, sequence and organization (SSO) in this case was defined as \\"the manner in which the program operates, controls and regulates the computer in receiving, assembling, calculating, retaining, correlating, and producing useful information.\\" SSO refers to non- literal elements of computer programs that include \\"data input formats, file structures, design, organization and flow of the code, screen outputs or user interfaces, and the flow and sequencing of the screens.\\" Decision The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit noted that computer programs are literary works under U.S. law. The court drew an analogy with a concept defined by Judge Learned Hand who noted, talking about a play, that the exact wording was certainly protected, and then there were a series of layers of increasing abstraction before the high-level plot outline is reached, which is not protected. An ad hoc judgement based on careful comparison of the works would be needed to determine where in this spectrum any alleged copying lay, and to decide whether it was at a sufficiently specific level to be a violation rather than a different expression of the same idea. But \\"careful comparison\\" in the case of software works might involve checking millions of lines of code. The court rejected the \\"extrinsic-intrinsic\\" test that had commonly been used until then, where an expert and a lay observer are asked to independently determine whether the works are substantially similar. The court reasoned that with literary works a non-literal element is protected to the extent that it is an expression of an idea rather than the idea itself. By analogy, the purpose or function of a software work would be the work's \\"idea\\", while everything not necessary to that purpose or function would be part of the expression of the idea. The expression would be protected, but the basic purpose or function would not. On this basis the Court of Appeals upheld the district court's ruling of copyright violation due to similarity of SSO. The court found that the Copyright Act of 1976 supported its view of a software work as a compilation, saying: Results The Whelan decision initiated a period of excessively tight protection, suppressing innovation, since almost everything other than the broad purpose of a software work would be protected. The only exception was where the functionality could only be achieved in a very small number of ways. In these cases there could be no protection due to the merger doctrine, which applies when the expression and the idea are inextricably merged. Later the same year, in Broderbund v. Unison the court cited Whelan when finding that the overall structure, sequencing, and arrangement of screens, or the \\"total concept and feel\\", could be protected by copyright.

It has been suggested that sensory enhancement is an essential mechanism that underlies object-based attention.Chen, Z. (In press). Object-based attention: A tutorial review.

Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 34, 842‚Äì853. because the spread of attention facilitates the efficiency of processing the features of the object as a whole. The qualities of the cued object, such as spatial resolution and contrast sensitivity, are therefore more strongly represented in one's memory than the qualities of other objects or locations that received little or no attentional resource.Carrasco, M., & Yeshurun, Y. (2009). Covert attention effects on spatial attention. In N. Srinivasan (Ed.), Progress in Brain Research: vol. 176, attention (pp. 65‚Äì86). The Netherlands: Elsevier. Information processing of these objects also tends to be significantly faster and more accurate as the representations have become more salient.Ho, C. M. (In press). Object-based attention: Sensory enhancement or scanning priorizatation. Acta Psychologica. Evidence of sensory enhancement=Single-cell recordings Single-cell recordings experiments were the first experiments to support the presence of sensory enhancement. V1 neurons in monkeys were measured for neural responses by Roelfsema, Lamme & Spekreijse (1998),Roelfsema, P. R., Lamme, V. A. F., & Spekreijse, H. (1998). Object- based attention in the primary visual cortex of the macaque monkey. Nature, 395, 376‚Äì381. while the monkeys performed a curve-tracing task. The neurons were found to be more active when their receptor fields were on the target- curve as opposed to when their receptor fields fell on the distractor-curve. Furthermore, enhancement was present in the neurons whose receptor fields were on segments of the target-curve relative to segments of the distractor-curve. This effect occurred regardless of whether the curves were spatially separate or overlapping. The presence of neural enhancement when the neurons receptor fields fell on the target-curve could suggest that attention is spreading to the boundaries of the object and then stopping. More recently, Roelfesema and Houtkamp (2011)Roelfsema, P. R., & Houtkamp, R. (2011). Incremental grouping of image elements in vision. Attention, Perception, & Psychophysics, 73, 2542‚Äì2572. found that there was a time difference in the onset of enhancement in these V1 neurons. The enhancement of the neuron took longer to appear as the spatial distance between the fixation of attention and receptor field increased. This finding is supported by the performance of mental curve tracing tasks in humans.Houtkamp, R., Spekreijse, H., & Roelfsema, P. R. (2003). A gradual spread of attention during mental curve tracing. Perception & Psychophysics, 65, 1136‚Äì1144. The results of these single cell recording studies therefore suggest that attention when deployed within an object enhances the representations of the object as a whole and this process of enhancement is gradual so it takes time to complete. Attention to an object or surface has been directly linked by Wannig, RodrŒØguez and Freiwald (2007)Wannig, A., Rodr√≠guez, V., & Freiwald, W. A., (2007). Attention to surfaces modulates motion processing in extrastriate area MT. Neuron, 54, 639‚Äì651. to increased neural activation of representations in the early sensory areas. They found support for the enhancement of targets when motion sensitive neurons in the middle temporal (MT) areas of monkey brains were activated during a cued transparent random-dot surface task. As there was more activation in the MT region when there was a motion related to the attended surface or object as opposed to the unattended surface or object, even though the two surfaces were overlapping. Event-related potential (ERPs) Evidence from numerous event-related potential (ERPs) studies have found that there is an enhancement of objects when attention is focused on them. This is associated with an N1 enhancement over the occipital-temporal areas. However, a study by MartŒØnez, Teder-S√§lej√§rvi, Vazquez, Moholm, Foxe, Javitt, Russo, Worden and Hillyard (2006)Mart√≠nez, A., Teder-S√§lej√§rvi, W., Vazquez, M., Molholm, S., Foxe, J. J., Javitt, D. C., Di Russo, F., Worden, M. S., & Hillyard, S. A. (2006). Objects are highlighted by spatial attention. Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, 18, 298‚Äì310. found that although there was N1 enhancement in this region, the enhancements relating to object-based attention were smaller in N1 amplitude than the enhancement for space-based attention. Functional magnetic imaging (fMRI) Converging evidence of sensory enhancement has been found in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies. A study by O'Craven, Downing and Kanwisher (1999)O'Craven, K. M., Downing, P. E., & Kanwisher, N. (1999). fMRI evidence for objects as the units of attentional selection. Nature, 401, 584‚Äì587. found that when their participants attended to one attribute (face or house) this led to an enhancement of the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal change in the area of the brain that was responsible for processing that specific attribute as well as the brain region that is associated with processing task- irrelevant attributes that belong to the attended as opposed to the unattended object. Neural activation related to attributes that were not relevant to the task differed in relation to whether the attribute belonged to the attended or unattended object which supports sensory enhancement. It would suggest that attention is enhancing the neural representations of the objects attributes as a whole regardless of the relevance to the task. Arrington, Carr, Mayer and Rao (2000)Arrington, C. M., Carr, T. H., Mayer, A. R., & Rao, S. M. (2000). Neural mechanisms of visual attention: Object-based selection of a region in space. Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, 12, 106‚Äì117. found additional support for sensory enhancement. They found that when an individual was attending to a region of space that was bound by an object it induced stronger brain activity as opposed to when they were attending to an empty space, not bound together by an object. Thus giving evidence that could indicate that object-based selection could be utilising additional mental resources on top of location-based spatial selection. In saying this, the results of the fMRI studies do not examine whether the degree of enhanced activation is equal in all aspects of the attended object, it just shows that there is enhancement for the object as a whole. Neural correlates=Associations with the early visual cortex Mœãller and Kleinschmidt (2003) M√ºller, N. G., & Kleinschmidt, A. (2003). Dynamic interaction of object- and space-based attention in retinotopic visual areas. The Journal of Neuroscience, 23, 9812‚Äì9816. looked at the early retinotopic visual areas to see if they play a role in object-based attention. They found that when an individual focused on a spatial cued there was retinotopic activity in the V1, V2, V3 and V4 areas that represented locations outside the cued region, suggesting that information from these regions is also being processed. These regions were however enhanced when these locations were bound to the cued area by a common object that extended beyond the originally cued region. This finding could support the argument for sensory enhancement, as the attention of the individual was extending to the boundaries of the object. They also found that the neural responses in these early visual regions where controlled by these object-based effects. Neuropsychological findings: a case study Patient D.F. has defined bilateral lesions to the lateral occipital (LO) areas of her brain. She presented with normal covert spatial attention and thus could mentally focus on a specific sensory stimuli. However, when her spatial attention was tested it was found that when she focused her attention selectively during a task, she was not sensitive to the presentation of objects. The results of the study by de-Wir, Kentridge and Milner (2009)de- Wit, L. H., Kentridge, R. W., & Milner, A.D. (2009). Object-based attention and visual area LO. Neuropsychologia, 47, 1483‚Äì1490. found that although the basic figure-ground segmentation was not effected in D.F., she was still unable to influence the spread of her attentional resources over an object as a whole. This resulted in her having a fragmented representation of the object that was present in the area she had focused her attention, whereas an individual with normal object-based attention processing should have a complete representation due to sensory enhancement. The lack of any object- based effects in tasks could therefore suggest that the LO region plays a key role in object-based attention. Alternate mechanisms that could modulate object-based attention Two alternate mechanisms have been proposed, in addition to sensory enhancement, to modulate object-based attention: attentional prioritization and attentional shifting. Attentional prioritization Unlike sensory enhancement, attentional prioritization suggests that the order in which spatial locations or objects are scanned during a visual search will influence how well they are processed. In the case of a cued object, attention by default will be deployed to the object and processing will begin within the attended object and thus later recall of the objects qualities will be relatively better than the recall for objects that were further away from the cue. Attentional shifting Attentional shifting is based on visual demand, as it is more demanding to shift attention between objects than it is to shift attention within an object. The increase in demand when attention is moved between objects requires an additional disengagement of processing operations in order to move attention to an object beyond the one that is being attended to. Memory for an object as a whole could be more accurate because it is more cost effective to completely process an area bound by an object than it is to rapidly shift attentional resources between two or more objects. This is because information about the newly attended object may not be processed because of the disengagement of processing operations as the visual system refocuses on the new location.

This means that as fans enter and walk around the concourse, they block the view of the fans already seated. This problem is compounded by the handicap seating being on the field side of the concourse, obstructing the view of the fans sitting in the first few rows.

It was founded after the 1911 elections as an alliance between the Home Rule Party under Hannes Hafstein, the moderate part of the Independence Party and some Independents. When the Althing convened in July 1912 the party was formally registered as a parliamentary group comprising 32 of the 40 members and Hannes Hafstein was appointed Minister for Iceland. The purpose of the party was to solve the issue of a union treaty between Iceland and Denmark, which had proven extremely difficult to solve after the Althing refused a draft proposal from the Danish-Icelandic constitutional commission in 1908. A compromise proposal presented by Hannes in spring 1913 was heavily criticized in the Icelandic press, and the Union Party split into three factions, a group that continued to support Hannes, a restored Home Rule Party under the leadership of L√°rus H. Bjarnason and a Farmers' Party. Hannes succeeded in getting most of the party's MPs members reunited, apart from four MPs that continued as the Farmers' Party, and a constitutional proposal was finally approved in the fall of 1913. Upon reunification the party was formally registered as the Home Rule Party, but was still commonly known as the Union Party. The supporters of Hannes lost the 1914 election and he subsequently resigned. The constitutional proposal was approved for a second time by the Althing in 1914 and formed the basis for the union treaty of 1918.

Its aim is to use film as a powerful mass communication medium to mobilize and educate people, improve the quality level of Cuba films with appreciation among the masses and reach a wide public. Through educating the new generation of young directors, one of its responsibilities is to transform Cuba from a country of cinematic consumption to a production. ICAIC logo for its 50th anniversary History of the ICAIC=The creation of the ICAIC Before the Revolution, Cubans did not receive free education. Only wealthy people could get educated. Therefore, prior to 1959, the illiteracy rate was very high. The government wanted to find a way to reach public. It is hard for the government to produce books to reach public because people are required to have basic knowledge on understanding the wordings. So, cinema and other mass media were considered the best way to reach the public. Therefore, the Cuban government put more focus on the development of mass media. Hollywood is the dominant film market all over the world, including Cuba. Also, Cuban film is described as \\"Imperfect Cinema\\". This is a theme that shows the authentic livelihoods and the Third World struggles to the public. The style is to educate people with the correct human beings, train audiences to become more active on interpreting the meanings and enhance their critical thinking skills. Due to these backgrounds, the Cuban government established a national film institute called Cuban Institute of Cinematographic Art and Industry (ICAIC). The ICAIC is the first cultural act of the revolutionary government.Hernandez, Andres R. \\"Filmmaking and Politics: The Cuban Experience.\\" The American behavioral scientist 17.3 (1974) 159. The aims are to educate people and improve the quality level of Cuban films. Also, the ICAIC hopes to transform Cuba from a country of consumption to production. ICAIC made two clarifications: first, ‚Äúcinema is an art‚Äù, and second, cinema constitutes ‚Äúan instrument of opinion and formation of individual and collective consciousness‚Äù.Young, Cynthia. \\"Havana up in Harlem: LeRoi Jones, Harold Cruse and the Making of a Cultural Revolution.\\" Science & Society 65.1 (2001): 19. Due to these clarifications, it led numerous underground filmmakers joining together. In the 1960s Due to some institutions establishing before ICAIC, they organized workshops to train technicians. These institutions include Film Department at Havana University, Sociedad Cultural \\"Nuestro Tiempo\\" (Cultural Society \\"Our Times\\") and Catholic Center of Cinematographic Orientation (CCOC).Hernandez, Andres R. \\"Filmmaking and Politics: The Cuban Experience.\\" The American behavioral scientist 17.3 (1974): 366 Therefore, Cuba's film industry did not lack of skilled technicians, but it lacked experienced directors. Tom√°s Guti√©rrez Alea and Julio Garc√≠a Espinosa were the only two main directors in Cuba in the 1960s, so the international program for educating young directors became indispensable. ICAIC sent trainee directors to work as assistants in France, Italy, East Germany, and elsewhere.Johnson, William. Cubacine Cinematograf√≠a. N.p., n.d. . \\"Report from Cuba.\\" Film Quarterly 19.4 (1966): 32. Working as an assistant can help understand the whole process of filmmaking. And the basic filmmaking skill is very useful when they become directors in the future. In 1960, Cine Cubano, the ICAIC‚Äôs film journal, is published. It includes films, interviews, filmographies, and movie plots.Jacmino, Raquel. \\"The Images of a Nation 50 Years of the ICAIC.\\" Cine y... revista de estudios intedisplinarios sobre cine en espan~ol. 2.2 (2010): 59. They put education into powerful words. Cine Cubano invites all people to submit their writings and share their opinions to the films, as well as teach their critical thinking. Beyond subsidies by the government, ICAIC receives a lot of sponsorships from Cine Cubano.Chanan, Michael. Cuban Cinema. MN: University of Minnesota Press, 2004.

Johnson, William. \\"Report from Cuba.\\" Film Quarterly 19.4 (1966): 32. This was not healthy to the Cuban film industry. After that, the US trade embargo made the Hollywood films become less accessible to Cuba. To Cuban cinema, it was about time to explore something new from other countries and not rely on the U.S. production. To keep Cuba's theaters going, the ICAIC imported a large number of movies from France, Italy, Japan and other countries, which creates a great diversity. For audiences, it is a great chance to know more different cultures from movies, and then they can enhance the culture exchange and stimulate a new way of thinking. In the 1970s Although the Revolution has improved the Cubans‚Äô livelihoods, Cuba was still in a circle of underdevelopment. The government focused on the agricultural development, especially in sugar production, in 1969, which called the Year of the Decisive Effort. The aim was to produce a ten-million-ton sugar harvest in 1970. Due to the sugar production project, the government tightened the control on subsidizing the ICAIC. Therefore, Cuba cinema entered a \\"gray period\\" in the 1970s. ICAIC suffered many problems such as limited financial and technical resources. The number of audiences who are willing to go to the theaters decreased due to the growth of the television in the 1970s. Comparing to the very productive period of the 1960s, an overall decline in quality exists in the 1970s. Luckily, those young directors went back to Cuba and contributed to the Cuban film industry after training. Although the films were not extraordinary, it helped maintain the Cuban film industry. In 1979, ICAIC establishes International Festival of the New Latin American in Havana.Jacmino, Raquel. \\"The Images of a Nation 50 Years of the ICAIC.\\" Cine y... revista de estudios intedisplinarios sobre cine en espan~ol. 2.2 (2010): 61. This festival is to celebrate the Latin American cinema by gather outstanding directors, producers and people who contributes to Latin American's film industry. Moreover, it is to bring world attention to cinema from Cuba and the rest of Latin America. It shows to the other countries such as Europe, North America that Latin America film industry is able to stand on their own. In the 1980s Cuba in the 1980s had not fully escaped the economic legacy of its past. Despite of the economic influence, the passion of the ICAIC on education through cinema did not decline. ICAIC started working on international coproduction with Spain and the Soviet Union. During the 1980s, ICAIC has changed the organization structure and formed a separate office only for exhibition and associated activities for educating people. Also, the Escuela International de Cine y Televisi√≥n (International School of Film and Television) got founded by the ICAIC in 1986.Stock, Ann Marie. On Location in Cuba: Street Filmmaking during Times of Transition . Ed. Louis A. Perez, Jr. North Carolina: The University of North Carolina Press, 2009. Print. 41. Active directors, editors, producers, sound technicians, and other experts from around the world have been invited to this school to share their experience. EICTV helps the way for new modes of producing and distributing films, which prepares elites for new generation. Those changes point out that the ICAIC is devoted to educate people and draw people‚Äôs attention by organizing activities. The \\"Special Period\\" (1990‚Äì1995) The collapse of the Soviet Union put Cuba into a crisis because Cuba relied on the latter to remain a viable economy. People in Cuba suffered from daily shortages such as electricity blackouts, severe gasoline rationing, huge cuts in public transportation, and bicycles from China. Filmmakers, artists and intellectuals suffered the same consequence as everyone else. ICAIC only completed three features in 1990.Chanan, Michael. Cuban Cinema. MN: University of Minnesota Press, 2004. Print. 449. At 1991, due to the economic crisis, it also led people to escape the island. The consequence of the ‚ÄúSpecial Period\\" of the 1990s for Cuban cinema is drastic reduction in the resources from film production to distribution. As a result, the ICAIC engaged in co-production with other countries such as Spain, (Germany) and Mexico. Fresa y chocolate (Strawberry and Chocolate) is one of the significant movies co-produced with Spain during the Special Period. More than that, it helps maintain Cuban films internationally and expand the Spanish-language film market. Recent years in Cuban cinema Despite ongoing difficulties, ICAIC continues develop the Cuban film industry and celebrated its 60th anniversary in 2019.

The first Chinese to visit Britain was Michael Alphonsius Shen Fu-tsung in 1687, who travelled to Europe with a Belgian Jesuit Father Philippe Couplet. Shen helped to translate Chinese works at the Bodleian Library, University of Oxford. He and Couplet left in 1688.  18th Century  The first Chinese to immigrate to Britain, settling in Scotland, was William Macao who lived in Edinburgh from 1779. He was the first Chinese to marry a British woman and have children. He worked for The Board of Excise in Scotland for over 40 years. He was involved in a significant court case in 1818 related to naturalization and for a period gained Scottish nationality. He is buried in St Cuthbert's Graveyard in Edinburgh.  1800s to World War II  In the early 19th century, Chinese seamen began to establish small communities in the port cities of Liverpool and London. In London, the Limehouse area became the site of the first European Chinatown. The East India Company, which imported popular Chinese commodities such as tea, ceramics and silks, also brought Asian sailors and needed trustworthy intermediaries to arrange their care and lodgings while they were in London.A South Asian History of Britain: Four Centuries of Peoples from the Indian Subcontinent, Michael Fisher, Shompa Lahiri and Shinder Thandi. London: Greenwood Press, May 2007. A Chinese seaman known as John Anthony took on the lucrative role of looking after Chinese sailors for the East India Company in the late 18th and early 19th century. Anthony married his British partner's daughter. Wishing to buy property, but unable to so while an alien, in 1805 he used part of the fortune he had amassed to pay for an Act of ParliamentThe Gentleman‚Äôs Magazine, August 1805 - obituary of John Anthony naturalising him as a British subject; thus being the first Chinese to gain British citizenship. However, he died a few months after the Act was passed. In 1839, John Hochee became the first Chinese to be naturalised by Denization and inherited the property of John Elphinstone for whom he had worked. The first Chinese student to study and graduate in Britain was Huang Kuan who attended Edinburgh University Medical School from 1850 to 1855, but like other Chinese who studied in Britain returned to live in China. Before 1900, only a few Chinese who came to Britain as seamen, servants, jugglers, etc. decided to stay, and some married British women. By the mid-1880s, small Chinatowns started to form in London and Liverpool with grocery stores, eating houses and meeting places and, in the East End, Chinese street names. By 1890, there were two distinct, if small, Chinese communities living in east London. Chinese from Shanghai settled around Pennyfields, Amoy Place, and Ming Street and those from Guangzhou Canton and Northern and southern China Southern China lived around Gill Street and Limehouse Causeway. Liverpool also saw the beginning of a Chinese community, although this remained small until later in the 20th century. In 1877, Kuo Sung-tao, the first Chinese minister to Britain, opened the country's legation in London. There was growing prejudice against the Chinese community, particularly among British seamen who misperceived the Chinese seamen as a threat to their jobs. This prejudice was fed by media misrepresentations of the Chinese in Limehouse and Liverpool as being heavily involved in gambling and opium use, and objections to Chinese marrying British women. From the early 1900s, due to being blocked from any other employment, many Chinese established small laundries. As few Chinese women lived in Britain, a number married British women and the laundries were operated as family concerns with all the family assisting. A few opened restaurants in their communities and the first recorded Chinese restaurant opened in London's Soho area in 1907. A small number of others also opened there, although it was not until the 1970s that London Soho Chinatown began to grow. There was resistance to Chinese settling in Britain. After World War I ended, the Aliens Restriction Act was extended in 1919 to include peacetime, bringing about a decline in the Chinese population in Britain. In spite of requests from some of the 100,000 Chinese brought from China to serve in the Chinese Labour Corp in France and Belgium during the war to live in Britain, not one was given permission to enter the country. By 1918, the number of Chinese living in Pennyfields, Poplar totalled less that 200; all were men and nine of them had English wives. Although the numbers of Chinese residing in Limehouse, Liverpool and other ports fluctuated, the number of settled Chinese immigrants before the 1950s remained relatively small. In World War II as more men were required to crew British merchant ships, the Chinese Merchant Seamen's Pool of approximately 20,000 was established with its headquarters in Liverpool. However, at the end of the war few Chinese who had worked as merchant seamen were allowed to remain in Britain. The British Government and the shipping companies colluded to forcibly repatriate thousands of Chinese seamen. Many of the seamen left behind wives and mixed-race children that they would never see again.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-33962179 More than 50 years later in 2006, a memorial plaque in remembrance for those Chinese seamen was erected on Liverpool's Pier Head.Yvonne Foley has set up Half and Half, a network for families of Chinese seamen who were repatriated after the Second World War.Chinese Liverpudlians: A history of the Chinese Community in Liverpool, by Maria Lin Wong. Liver Press, 1989. Post-World War II The 1951 Census recorded a big increase in Britain's Chinese population, then standing at 12,523, of whom over 4,000 were from Malaysia, and 3,459 single males from Hong Kong. The influx of Chinese into Britain coincided with the increased pressure in Hong Kong due to the build-up of the huge numbers of refugees streaming in from China following the end of the Chinese Civil War. At the time, nearly 100 Chinese restaurants were open, as former embassy staff and ex-seamen found a niche in this trade. Records showed remittances to Hong Kong of HK$ 2.5 million. The largest wave of Chinese immigration took place during the 1950s and 1960s and consisted predominantly of male agricultural labourers from Hong Kong, particularly from the rural villages of the New Territories. This also included immigration, through Hong Kong, from the Guangdong province of China. The majority of these Chinese men were employed in the then growing Chinese catering industry. By 2004 for comparison, according to official figures, just under half of Chinese men and 40% of Chinese women in employment worked in the distribution, hotel, and restaurant industry. Since the 1962 Commonwealth Immigrants Act, restrictions were placed on immigration from current and former British colonies, and these were tightened by successive governments. The Immigration act included a voucher system and significant Chinese migration to Britain did still continue by relatives of already settled Chinese and by those qualified for skilled jobs, until the end of the 1970s. Today, a significant proportion of British Chinese are second or third generation descendants of these post-World War II immigrants. Approximately 30,000 workers from the New Territories were resident in Britain in 1962 and records showed remittances at HK$40 million. Ninety-six wives from Hong Kong joined their husbands in Britain in the beginning of that year, indicating a new phase from 'sojourning' to family reunion and a more settled life. In 1976, Britain's Chinese population included approximately 6,000 full-time students and 2,000 nurses. The 1981 British Nationality Act deprived Hong Kong British Overseas Territories citizens of the right of abode in the United Kingdom, an issue that caused some controversy in the years leading up to the territory's handover to China in 1997. After the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, it was considered necessary to devise a British Nationality Selection Scheme to enable some of the population to obtain British citizenship to maintain confidence in Hong Kong and to counteract the effects of the emigration of many of its most talented residents. The United Kingdom made a provision to grant citizenship to 50,000 families, whose presence was important to the future of Hong Kong, under the British Nationality Act (Hong Kong) 1990. (See also British nationality law and British nationality law and Hong Kong). In 1981, the Census recorded Britain's Chinese population as 154,363. Thirty-five Chinese-language newspapers and 362 periodicals were on sale from seven bookshops in Soho. Sing Tao itself had a circulation of 10,000 in Britain. The Chinese population now numbered the elderly, and 30,000 children in British schools. Of these, 75 percent were born in the country, representing a new phase of settlement. In 1982, the Merseyside Chinese Community Services opened the 'Pagoda of Hundred Harmony', an advice centre built with the help of an Urban Aid grant. In 1983, the Chinese Information and Advice Centre (CIAC), an amalgamation of the Chinese Workers Group (1975) and the Chinese Action Group (1980) received Greater London Council (GLC) funding for a centre. Sixty Chinese associations, including women's groups and old people's clubs, were consolidated into two national umbrella organisations. There were approximately 7,000 restaurants, takeaways and other Chinese owned businesses, indicating a slow-down in the rate of growth. There were 926 students attending the Chinese Chamber of Commerce Mother Tongue School, which ran classes up to O-level standard. The most significant migration from China commenced in mid-1980s. This coincided with the Chinese government's relaxed restrictions on emigration, although most left for the United States, Canada, and Australia. In 1984‚Äì85, the British and Chinese governments signed the Draft Agreement on the transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong to China in 1997. Construction was also begun of Manchester's Chinatown archway (now the largest in Europe), and was completed in 1987. The House of Commons Home Affairs Committee report identified five main problems faced by the Chinese in Britain. Recommendations included more language training, careers advice, community centres, and interpretation and advice services. Over 50 percent of the Chinese population was under 30; 50 percent lived outside the large metropolitan areas; only 2 percent were professionals, which included doctors, solicitors, architects, bankers, stockbrokers, business executives, teachers and university lecturers. In 1987, Manchester's Chinatown Archway, the largest in Europe, was completed, marking co-operation between the government of China, Manchester City Council and the local Chinese community. Currently, the largest Chinese arch in the UK is located in Chinatown, Liverpool. It was constructed in 2000 and is also the largest such archway in the world outside of China.http://www.visitliverpool.com/site/chinese-arch-p54681 As Hong Kong and China became wealthier during the 1990s, Hong Kong and Chinese parents increasingly sent their children to study in the UK and elsewhere. An estimated 80,000 Hong Kong and Chinese students attended UK universities in the academic year of 2004‚Äì05. Small numbers of unskilled migrants from China sought employment in the UK in the early 1990s. In recent years, there has been an increase in illegal immigrants coming from China and other countries into the United Kingdom, some of whom pay traffickers (so-called \\"snakeheads\\") to smuggle them into many Western countries. Due to historical and cultural reasons, a sizeable proportion originate from Fujian province in southeast China. Others are citizens from the Commonwealth countries (mostly former British colonies), who have been able to obtain tourist or student visas and remain in the UK after their visas have expired. Most work in the black economy or are employed as illegal cheap labour, usually in agriculture and catering. This activity became publicised nationwide in tragic consequences in the form of the 2004 Morecambe Bay cockling disaster, though most migrants have remained invisible. In April 2001, one of the largest demonstrations by the Chinese community, with around 1,000 people protesting, was held in London against media reports that Chinese restaurants had started the 2001 United Kingdom foot-and-mouth crisis by using diseased meat. Within weeks, a Chinese community monitoring group reported that trade at restaurants and takeaways had plummeted because an unsubstantiated rumour had become a scare story labelling an entire community as \\"dirty\\". Following the march, the then Agriculture Secretary Nick Brown publicly denied that the rumours had begun in his department and described the controversy as a racist attack on the Chinese community.Chinese Britain BBC News Online As of 2001, there were about 12,000 Chinese takeaways and 3,000 Chinese restaurants in the UK.Chinese restaurant 'not disease source' Communities Liverpool's Chinatown is the largest such arch outside of China From the beginning of Chinese settlement in the ports of London and Liverpool, there were no Chinatowns but communities of mixed families. Because few Chinese women were able to come to Britain, Chinese seamen established homes with local women. Many did not actually marry because that meant the woman could lose her British citizenship and would become an alien, resulting in restrictions on travel and benefits. The children of such unions often faced discrimination when it came to finding jobs. Many followed the example of Yorkshire-born Harry Cheong who had an exemplary army record during the Second World War, including fighting in Burma for which he was mentioned in dispatches. But on leaving the army he had to change his surname to get a job interview and has since lived as Harry Dewar. Such name changes have meant much Chinese history in Britain is now difficult to trace. Notable people who had Chinese fathers and English mothers include footballer Hong Y \\"Frank\\" Soo, who played for Stoke City (1933‚Äì1945) and Leslie Charteris who wrote The Saint novels that were made into the successful 1960s TV series.BBC - Radio 4 - Chinese in Britain Liverpool The first presence of Chinese people in Liverpool dates back to the early 19th century, with the main influx arriving at the end of the 18th century. This was in part due to the Alfred Holt and Company establishing the first commercial shipping line to focus on the China trade. From the 1890s onwards, small numbers of Chinese began to set up businesses catering to the Chinese sailors working on Holt's lines and others. Some of these men married working class British women, resulting in a number of British-born Eurasian Chinese being born during World War II in Liverpool. At the beginning of the War, there were up to 20,000 Chinese mariners in the city. In 1942, there was a strike for rights and pay equal to that of white mariners. The strike had lasted for 4 months. For the duration of the War these men were labelled as \\"troublemakers\\" by the shipowners and the British Government. At the end of the conflict, they were forbidden shore jobs, their pay was cut by two-thirds and they were offered only one-way voyages back to China. Hundreds of men were forced to leave their families, with many of their Eurasian children continuing to live in and around Liverpool's Chinatown to this day.Liverpool and its Chinese Seaman London London's Chinatown, located in the Soho area of the West End of London. Britain began trading with China in the 17th century and a small community of Chinese sailors grew up around Limehouse over the next two centuries. Due to heavy bomb damage, however, the number of Chinese in the area rapidly decreased. Changes to labour laws during the early 20th century meant that Chinese sailors found it increasingly difficult to find employment on ships. They turned instead to running to laundries and restaurants. From the 1960s on, the number of Chinese immigrating to London grew significantly with the main influx being from the New Territories (the mainland area of Hong Kong) coming to Britain to work in Chinese restaurants and take-aways. In London, Chinese restaurants expanded, especially in the Soho and Bayswater areas. Most who came spoke Cantonese or Hakka, though written Chinese was a means of communication for the whole community. The Chinese established various organisations such as language schools, gambling houses for socialising, and a Chinese Church in the West End. One notorious club was the Chi Kung Tong (Achieve Justice Society), the first Triad Society in Britain.Robertson, Frank. Triangle of Death. The Inside Story of the Triads - the Chinese Mafia.

See also The Guardian newspaper's January 2005 survey and maps of ethnic and religious diversity in LondonJanuary 2005 survey and maps of ethnic and religious diversity in London Guardian Online By the late 1960s, the Chinese restaurants and shops around Gerrard Street, Lisle Street, and Little Newport Street had evolved into \\"Tong Yan Kai\\", otherwise known as Chinatown. The general public developed a taste for Chinese food during the postwar restaurant boom. In 1963, the Zhongshan Workers' Club opened in the West End, showing films and running classes. The first Chinese New Year celebrations were held in Gerrard Street. The Overseas Chinese Service opened the first specialised agency to assist the Chinese in dealing with the host society by offering a translation and interpreting service. In the 1970s and 1980s, many ethnic Chinese who had settled in Vietnam for generations were forced to leave as \\"boat people\\" following the Vietnam War. Many settled in Lewisham, Lambeth, and Hackney, as well as elsewhere in the UK. The 1980s and 1990s saw a migration of academics and professionals from Chinatown to the suburbs of Croydon and Colindale. Since the 1980s, London's Chinatown has been transformed by Westminster City Council to become a major tourist attraction and a cultural focal point of the Chinese community in London. Today over 100,000 Chinese people live in London, and are more evenly dispersed throughout the city and its boroughs. Roughly a quarter of the Chinese population of the United Kingdom now live in London, mainly in the boroughs of Barnet, Haringey, Waltham Forest, Hackney, Southwark and Westminster. Mare Street in Hackney is the hub of a small Vietnamese community. The principal languages of the London Chinese community are Cantonese and Hakka (from the New Territories, Hong Kong, and Vietnam). There are also some speakers of Hokkien, Teochew and Hainanese. The Chinese from the People's Republic of China, Taiwan, and Singapore tend to speak Mandarin (or Putonghua). A large network of Chinese schools and community centres offers support and a means of passing on cultural identity from one generation to the next. Sheffield Sheffield has no official Chinatown although London Road, Highfield is the centre of the Sheffield Chinese community. There are many Chinese restaurants, supermarkets, and community stores as well as the Sheffield Chinese Community Centre. The Sheffield Chinese community is pressing for the street to be formally labelled Sheffield's Chinatown. The Chinese community in Sheffield is also spreading toward the city centre, with a notable number of Chinese people, greatly influenced by the city's university, which has the largest number of Chinese in the country. Wales The largest two communities of Chinese people in Wales are in Swansea (approx 2,000+),http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/south_west/3654578.stm and Cardiff (approx 1,750+), both of which were major port towns. A number of the former seamen from the port of Liverpool have also retired like the native locals into rural North Wales, with a resultant aged community in Gwynedd.http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/north_west/5052176.stm There are noted Chinatowns in both cities, as well as dedicated Chinese cemeteries.http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/south_east/8602713.stm  See also  * British Chinese * China‚ÄìUnited Kingdom relations References British people of Chinese descent History of immigration to the United Kingdom Chinese emigration ","title":"History of Chinese immigration to the United Kingdom"},{"id":"35989076","text":"Akira Yamaguchi (Â±±Âè£ ÊôÉ) (born 1969 in Tokyo, Japan) is a Japanese contemporary artist.

Named after lead sponsor Citigroup, it is operated by Motivate (formerly Alta Bicycle Share), with former Metropolitan Transportation Authority CEO Jay Walder as chief executive until September 30, 2018 when the company was acquired by Lyft. The system's bikes and stations use BIXI-branded technology from PBSC Urban Solutions. First proposed in 2008 by the New York City Department of Transportation, Citi Bike's scheduled 2011 opening was delayed by Hurricane Sandy and technological problems. It officially opened in May 2013 with 332 stations and 6,000 bikes. Annual expansions have brought the totals to 706 stations and 12,000 bikes , making the service the largest bike sharing program in the United States. Further expansions for Citi Bike are planned to extend its service area across the Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Queens, and increase the number of bikes to 40,000. , there are 169,000 annual subscribers. Citi Bike riders took an average of 56,497 rides per day in 2019, and the system reached a total of 50 million rides in October 2017. History= Development and delays  Customers at 278x278px In an effort to reduce emissions, road wear, collisions, and road and transit congestion and to improve public health, the New York City Department of Transportation (NYCDOT) researched alternative forms of transportation, publishing a strategic plan in 2008. According to NYCDOT statistics, 56% of all automobile trips within the city are under (with 22% under and 10% under ), well within distances readily served by bicycle. To encourage residents to use bicycles more, the city committed to expanding bike lane miles, bike racks, and bike-parking shelters. In the 2009 bicycle share feasibility report, the New York City Department of City Planning (DCP) recommended building out the system in three phases in the four most populous boroughs, but no timeline was made public. The city, which had already been encouraging cycling as transportation, decided to establish a bicycle share program of the kind that had seen success in other cities. In 2011, it selected Alta Bicycle Share to operate the bike share in New York City. Citi Bike was created as a public‚Äìprivate partnership operated by NYC Bike Share LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Alta. The system, which was first supposed to start in fall 2011, got pushed back to summer 2012 due to uncertainties about where to place the rental stations. The city had originally intended to place Citi Bike stalls mostly on sidewalks and public plazas, but there were some locations where stalls would take up parking spaces. The 2012 implementation date was only for Phase 1 of Citi Bike, with more phases to come later. Software problems delayed the planned start until March 2013. These problems were also reported by Alta programs in Chicago and in Chattanooga, Tennessee. The problems reportedly occurred because the Public Bike System Company, a Canadian affiliate of Alta, was involved in a dispute with software supplier 8D Technologies. Then, Hurricane Sandy damaged 1,000 bicycles and 60 stations in storage at Brooklyn Navy Yard. As planning progressed, some residents expressed dismay at the lack of docking stations in their neighborhoods while others fought against stations on their blocks.  Deployment  Citi Bike finally began operations on May 27, 2013, with 332 stations.Bike Share Launches for Riders with Annual Memberships NY1, May 27, 2013 The stations were located in Manhattan south of 59th Street and in Brooklyn north of Atlantic Avenue and west of Nostrand Avenue. Officials said the system opened with 6,000 bikes. At the time of implementation, it was the largest bikesharing program in the United States. When launched, the system was slated to expand to 10,000 bicycles and 600 stations in Manhattan south of 79th Street, plus stations in several Brooklyn neighborhoods, including Greenpoint, Crown Heights, Bedford-Stuyvesant, Park Slope and Carroll Gardens as well as parts of Queens. At first, the timeline for the expansion was not made publicly available, but it was later announced that the expansion would be complete by the end of 2016. There has been increasing interest in further expansion across New York City; for example, in June 2013 a Brooklyn politician opened a petition drive to accelerate deployment in Greenpoint. In contrast, the May 2013 installation deliberately bypassed South Williamsburg. Throughout the first year, there were more than 100,000 registered members who rode over , including 70,000 members in the first three months alone. On August 6, 2013, riders took 42,010 trips, the largest single-day total for any North American bike-sharing system. In Citi Bike's first few months, some kiosks docked too many bikes while others did not have enough, so the company started using a fleet of box trucks to carry bikes between different kiosks every day. The kiosks also had some software problems in their early months. Problems included stations that did not accept payment information; kiosks where passersby could take bikes without paying because the bikes were not locked securely; and bike docks that did not work at all, forcing riders to travel to other stations. Popularity 250x250px Citi Bike's massive, unexpected popularity caused problems within a year. In January 2014, the designer of Citi Bike's bicycles and docking stations filed for bankruptcy protection. Officials with Montreal, Quebec-based Public Bike System Company (also known as Bixi) said they were $46 million in debt, partly because the operators of Citi Bike and Chicago's Divvy bikeshare had withheld a combined $5 million in payments because of software glitches in the docking stations. Alta officials, who operate Citi Bike, Divvy, and Capital Bikeshare in Washington, D.C., said they anticipated no interruptions of service, though they did want $20 million to expand the system to 10,000 bikes and 600 stations. However, due to Citi Bike's various problems, expansions to the Upper East and Upper West Sides were delayed for at least a year. Its general manager resigned in March. The new mayor, Bill de Blasio, stated that he wanted to expand Citi Bike's reach, but that he could not make city funds available for such an expansion at that time. Citi Bike workers joined Transport Workers Union of America Local 100 in July 2015. The company had about 200 employees joining the union at the time. On September 17, in the face of overwhelming support for unionization, Citi Bike agreed to recognize TWU Local 100's representation of Citi Bike's labor force.  Expansion  Reorganization = On October 28, 2014, Alta Bicycle Share and NYCDOT announced a plan to improve and expand the Citi Bike program. Bikeshare Holdings LLC, a new entity formed by the partners at real estate developer Related Companies and gym chain Equinox Fitness, acquired Alta Bicycle Share‚Äîrenamed Motivate‚Äîand named Jay Walder as the new chief executive. (Motivate, and by extension Citi Bike, was acquired by Lyft in 2018.) The increase of funding included $5 million from Bikeshare Holdings; $70.5 million from a 10-year extension of the Citigroup sponsorship; and $15 million from the Goldman Sachs Urban Investment Group. As part of the restructuring deal, Walder moved the company headquarters from Portland, Oregon, to New York City. The Citi Bike system would continue to be operated by NYC Bicycle Share, a subsidiary of Alta Bicycle Share. By 2017, Citi Bike would expand its operations by 6,000 bikes and add 375 new docking stations. This agreement also calls for improvements to the system's operations, including upgrades to its software and technology. The company was also appointing a vice president for technology. Following two years of software errors in the bike share system, Motivate shut down the Citi Bike system over the last weekend of March 2015 to replace the existing system software with that of 8D Technologies. The new mobile platform was developed by the Polish software house Netguru. Since then, the Citi Bike system has continued to expand its installations using the 8D Technologies as its software and station equipment supplier. Through that summer, Motivate also refurbished all of the system's 6,000 bikes, as well as fixed the bicycle stations' kiosks and improved the bike docks at these stations. = Expansion to Jersey City and Queens = 250x250px In early 2015, as part of its expansion, NYCDOT and Motivate increased the price of annual memberships from $95 to $149 plus taxes, although annual rates for New York City Housing Authority residents and members of some Community Development Credit Unions will remain at $60 per year. That year, the company installed 91 new stations in Queens and Brooklyn, with 12 of these stations in Long Island City and the other 79 in Greenpoint, Williamsburg, and Bedford- Stuyvesant. Citi Bike also added 48 new stations on the Upper East and Upper West Sides, up to 86th Street. The system expanded across the Hudson River to Jersey City, New Jersey, on September 21, 2015, with 35 stations and 350 bikes. However, some Jersey City residents objected to the implementation of Citi Bike there, complaining of lost parking spots for cars. In July 2016, the Jersey City Citi Bike system was expanded for the first time, with another 15 stations and an additional 150 bikes. In August 2016, the company started installing 139 new stations in Manhattan up to 110th Street and in Brooklyn between Red Hook and Prospect Park. The stations in the new installation were closer together than in previous phases because the previous phases had not fulfilled National Association of City Transportation Officials' recommended bike share-station density of . Some residents of Park Slope were outspoken in opposition to the loss of car parking. One month later, on September 13, 2016, the system saw 64,672 trips, the highest recorded in one day at the time. After the December 2016 announcement of a further expansion to Harlem and Astoria, some city politicians proposed expanding the system further to the Bronx and Staten Island. By the end of 2017, Citi Bike planned to double its bike fleet to 12,000, with the possibility that some of the expansion could be publicly funded. On May 18, 2017, Motivate presented a proposal to expand the system in all five boroughs, including adding new stations to the Bronx and Staten Island, without any public funding. To make up for the lost tax funding, Motivate asked the city to waive fees charged for placing stalls inside former parking spots, as well as redesigning the payment hierarchy and possibly adding more ad space on pay stations. The 140 new stalls and 2,000 new bikes in Harlem, Crown Heights, Prospect Heights, Long Island City, and Astoria were installed in September 2017. The system saw its 50 millionth rider in early October 2017, as the new stalls were being activated. The new docking stations in Brooklyn led to an imbalance in the number of bikes in certain neighborhoods, since there were more bikes being docked in lower- elevation areas such as Downtown Brooklyn, while fewer riders docked bikes in high-elevation neighborhoods such as Prospect Heights and Crown Heights. = Dockless and phase 3 expansion = In 2018, officials proposed dockless bike sharing for the Citi Bike network, which would allow bikes to be rented without being tethered to docks. This was proposed after several bike sharing companies announced their intent to operate in New York City. In early August of that year, the dockless bike-sharing company Spin had started a dockless operation in the Rockaways, but had been told to cease and desist operations by the NYCDOT, which had licensed Citi Bike as the only official bike-share operator in New York City. Spin, intending to compete with Citi Bike with lower per-half-hour pricing‚Äîstruggled the rest of the month to get a permit. By the end of August, Citi Bike started designing a dockless prototype that could lock its own wheels based on whether the customer had paid. As part of a pilot program, Citi Bike also started testing 200 pedal-assisted electric bicycles, which soon became popular among customers. Additional e-bikes were planned to be added in advance of the 14th Street Tunnel shutdown, which would partially suspend service on the in Manhattan and under the East River to Brooklyn from 2019 to 2020. Lyft, which had acquired Motivate in July 2018, announced a further expansion of Citi Bike service in November 2018. The , five-year expansion would double the bike-share system's service area to . In addition, the number of bicycles would more than triple, from 12,000 to 40,000. This would make Citi Bike among the largest bike-share systems in the world. The Gothamist website, citing a Lyft employee, stated that electric bikes would make up the \\"vast majority\\" of the new bikes. In February 2019, it was announced that the Citi Bike system would have 4,000 electric bikes by that June, up from 200. Because of the popularity of the electric bikes, a $2 fee would be added to each electric bike trip starting April 27. However, on April 14, the company announced that all their electric bikes would be removed from service due to accidents while braking. In July 2019, Citi Bike announced a timeline for its phase 3 expansion, which would double its service area. At the time, new bike-share stalls were being installed in East Williamsburg, Brooklyn; Bushwick, Brooklyn; and Ridgewood, Queens, along the route of the BMT Canarsie Line, which serves the . By 2020, stalls would be installed in the remainder of Upper Manhattan (namely Hamilton Heights, Washington Heights, and Inwood) and in the South Bronx. Before 2023, new stalls would also be installed in southwest, southeast, and eastern Brooklyn, including Brownsville, East Flatbush, Kensington, Prospect Lefferts Gardens, Sunset Park, and the remaining portions of Bedford‚ÄìStuyvesant and Crown Heights. Stalls would also be installed in northwestern Queens, namely Sunnyside, Maspeth, Elmhurst, Jackson Heights, and Corona. That September 5, Citi Bike reached 91,529 trips, the highest-ever single-day ridership. In May 2020, the system expanded into the Bronx and further north into Manhattan.  Company  Citi Bike pay station in Midtown Manhattan; at left is a LinkNYC booth Citi Bike is wholly private and is not funded by any subsidies from the city. Citigroup spent million to be its lead sponsor for six years, and in return was allowed to put its name on the bikes; in 2014, Citigroup injected an additional and extended its sponsorship through 2024. However, the bikeshare is owned by NYC Bike Share LLC, a subsidiary of Alta Bicycle Share, Inc. Jay Walder was the CEO of Bikeshare Holdings, which includes Alta Bicycle Share, and in turn, NYC Bike Share LLC and Citi Bike, until 2018 when the company was acquired by Lyft. In February 2017, Motivate and 8D Technologies merged, with Citi Bike ultimately being operated under the purview of the combined companies. , Citi Bike is the largest bike-sharing system in the United States, a distinction it first held when it opened in 2013. Citi Bike also had 130,000 members , up from 100,000 members in 2016. Citi Bike had 5.8 million annual trips in 2013, increasing to 8 million trips in 2014; 10 million in 2015; 14.1 million in 2016; 16.4 million in 2017; and 17.6 million in 2018. the bike share averaged 48,315 daily trips, up 8% from 2017. When Citi Bike recorded 70,286 trips on July 26, 2017, it was called \\"the highest single-day ridership of any [bike share] system in the Western world outside of Paris.\\" The majority of Citi Bike riders were male , with women making a quarter of the trips and a third of membership. On average, Citi Bike trips wholly within Midtown Manhattan are at least faster, 2‚Äì3 minutes shorter, and $6 cheaper than a taxi between the same two points, with most taxi trips in that area being less than long. For trips between long, average Citi Bike trips are at least 5 minutes faster and $11.75 cheaper as opposed to the comparable taxi trip. A software developer at Genius extrapolated that from July 2016 to June 2017, forty percent of all taxi trips taken within neighborhoods served by Citi Bike were slower than the same trip via bike. Over half of all Citi Bike trips occur during rush hours . However, in 2015, there were at least 10 times as many taxi trips as Citi Bike trips in Midtown during rush hour. The NYCDOT publishes a list of Citi Bike usage statistics on its website. In Citi Bike's first three years of operations, no one died while riding a Citi Bike. This was partly attributed to the bikes' design, as well as the higher concentration of cyclists on New York City roads before and since Citi Bike's launch. The first death involving a Citi Bike occurred four years after the service's launch, in June 2017, when a cyclist in Chelsea was struck by a bus.  Bikes  The bicycles are utility bicycles; they have a unisex step-through frame with an upright seating position. They weigh about each. Their one-piece aluminum frame and handlebars conceal cables and fasteners in an effort to protect them from vandalism and bad weather; the handlebars are located above the seat, allowing riders to sit upright and thereby maintain balance. They are equipped with Shimano Nexus three-speed, grip-shifter-operated internally- geared hubs, full mudguards/fenders and chain guard. The heavy-duty tires are puncture-resistant and filled with nitrogen to maintain proper inflation pressure longer. The tires are also wider, leading to increased stability. Twin LED rear lights of a pre-2015 design are integrated into the frame; the frame's bright-blue color increases the bikes' visibility. The bikes are built in Saguenay, Quebec, by Cycles Devinci. Citi Bikes are slower than most utility bicycles, averaging only as opposed to regular bicycles' average speed of , which increases safety due to a lowered risk of a high-speed collision. The bikes are assembled in Detroit. Transporting bikes on a bicycle trailer In 2015, Ben Serotta helped redesign the bicycle to include a new seat, a simpler gear shifting mechanism, fewer and brighter lights, and a European-style center kickstand. All of Citi Bike's bicycles were to be renovated to include this new design. However, in 2016, a thousand of the newly redesigned Citi Bikes were taken out of service due to a part in the front wheel degrading faster than expected. In 2017, CitiBike began adding NuVinci gear hubs that offer continuous-gear shifting. In early 2017, as part of a pilot program with a firm named Blaze, 250 bikes received anterior laser lights that project a teal silhouette on the ground to warn drivers and pedestrians in their path. Citi Bike moves thousands of bikes each day from places where they accumulate to places where they are scarce. It sometimes uses box trucks to accomplish this task. Citi Bike members can also volunteer to move bikes from full to empty stations. These members, called \\"Bike Angels,\\" can earn rewards such as gift cards and renewed membership for moving these bikes. Since the \\"Bike Angels\\" program started in May 2016, almost 2,000 members have participated. If a user does not re-dock their bike within a certain time limit‚Äî45 minutes for members or 30 minutes for non-members‚Äîthey will be charged an extra fee. Annual members are charged $2.50 for every 15 minutes of further use, day pass users are charged $4 for every 15 minutes of further use, and single ride users are charged $3 for every 30 minutes of additional use. If a bike is not returned at all within 24 hours, a maximum \\"late fee\\" of $1,200 can be charged, though the fine may be reduced based on financial circumstances. In the event that a Citi Bike is lost or stolen, the member who last used it must file a theft report with the New York City Police Department within 24 hours, and they would be charged the maximum late fee. Late fees netted $5.2 million for Citi Bike from January to November 2015, comprising more than 15% of its revenue. In 2014, there were 300 reports of stolen Citi Bikes, which jumped to 476 reports in the first half of 2015 alone. Stolen bikes have been found in the Brooklyn neighborhoods of East New York, Crown Heights, and Brownsville, as well as upper Manhattan. However, at least one man has ridden a Citi Bike as far as California.  Payment  311x311px , yearly passes cost $169, or $14.95 per month with an annual commitment. A reduced-fare pass costs $60, or $5 per month with an annual commitment, and is available only to NYCHA residents who are 16 or older, or members of selected credit unions. The original price of a Citi Bike annual membership was $95, but jumped to $149 in 2014 following the announcement of an expansion. Purchasers using a Citibank card receive a 10% discount when purchasing annual memberships through the Citi Bike website. Annual pass members receive a key and can make trips of up to 45 minutes without added charge, after which they pay $2.50 for each additional 15 minutes. Initial prices for daily and weekday passes sold at Citi Bike docking stations were $9.95 for a daily pass, and $25 for a weekly pass. Prices were eventually changed to $12 for a daily pass, and $24 for a three-day pass. Trips using these passes are limited to 30 minutes before the rider is charged an additional fee of $4 per 15 minutes. The 8.875% New York State sales tax is added to the cost of all passes. In 2014, Citi Bike announced that it was also exploring options for weekend, monthly, and tourist memberships. For riders who do not buy passes, a single ride costs $3 for 30 minutes. There is an additional charge of $3 for every 30 minutes thereafter. Trips on electric bikes cost an additional $2, or 50 cents for reduced-fare members. All payments are by credit card; Wageworks and Transitchek prepaid commuter cards are not accepted, as bike sharing programs do not qualify as eligible commuting expenses under US tax law.  Criticism  When Citi Bike first launched, some local bike shops in tourist areas reported a decline in their bike rental business, and some complained that Citi Bike's advertising was misleading tourists. At least one bike shop owner said that he was forced to close down his business in 2014 due to the popularity of Citi Bike. Dorothy Rabinowitz of The Wall Street Journal said, a few days after the system opened, that under the \\"autocratic\\" mayoralty of Michael Bloomberg, \\"we now look at a city whose best neighborhoods are absolutely begrimed by these blazing blue Citibank bikes.\\" Some people disliked the bright blue color and branding of the bicycles, while others pointed out that the stations blocked fire hydrants on the street. The concrete wheel stops at the end of each kiosk also poses a hazard, as these barriers act as a sudden, sharp speed bump. Another complaint was that bike stations take up car parking space for each eight bikes, a sentiment repeated in future stall installations. Later installations faced the opposite dilemma of having too few stations: one Streetsblog writer noted that the stations in the expansions were spaced further apart than the stations in the original service area, which would make the Citi Bike stations in these areas harder to access. In September 2017, a reporter for Time Out magazine wrote that the system did not serve the outer boroughs adequately, with stations only located in wealthier areas of Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens that were closer to the Manhattan central business districts.

The party ran as a single entity in the 1919 elections, emerging as the second largest party after the Home Rule Party. It remained in the government with the Home Rule Party and Progressive Party until 1920, when the Home Rule Party began to govern alone.McHale, p529 In the 1922 Upper House elections the Independence Party finished fifth, with just 5% of the vote, but returned to join the Home Rule Party in a coalition government. For the general elections the following year it allied with former members of the dissolved Home Rule Party to establish the Citizens' Party. The new party won the elections with 23 of the 42 seats, with the Independence Party winning a further two seats in the Upper House. The following year saw the Citizens' Party dissolved, with most MPs forming the Conservative Party.

The first documentary showed an ancient Kogi tribe civilisation (the Elder Brother) who emerge to offer their concern for people of the modern world (Younger Brother). Younger Brother is urged to change or suffer environmental disaster. After offering the warning the Kogi retreat to their community hidden in the mountains of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, Colombia. In the second documentary, the Kogis have re-emerged, realising that the importance of their warning had not been grasped. As well as warning Younger Brother they have decided to share their secret sciences in the belief that sharing these sciences will share their burden of changing the world for the better. Content summary Realising that their warning in 1990 was not fully grasped, the Kogis become more proactive. Even though their civilisation has never used wheels or created literature, they diligently study film cameras and train their own indigenous film crew. The Kogis ask Alan Ereira, whom they allowed to film their 1990 message, to assist. The Kogi Mamos decide that there will be \\"no more secrets\\". They want to demonstrate their planetary healing sciences in front of the cameras to the modern world and show visible and measurable results. They also wish to teach other people how to conduct these sciences in order to heal the world. They speak with modern scientists in the belief that they have a different science to show them.

Two Kogi Mamos were expected to attend the conference. Production Alan Ereira'and Mama Shibulata during filming production of Aluna Originally the budget was set at ¬£270,000. Alan Ereira got Bruce Parry interested in the project and Parry met with the Kogi, who agreed to the project. With Parry involved, the BBC offered ¬£180,000 and Indus Films offered a further ¬£20,000. However, when Bruce Parry became 'committed to another project', the offer of funding from the BBC was withdrawn. Therefore, Alan Ereira had to seek alternative funding. Some of this funding came from the British charity, The Onaway Trust, which also helped fund Ereira's book on the Kogis, The Heart of the World. The Kogis had their own indigenous film crew, making it possible for the film to include previously unrecorded holy sites and practices that other film crews had been prohibited from seeing. Throughout the collaboration the Kogis exercised their autonomy while the film's director, Alan Ereira, looked forward to see what the indigenous crew had recorded. The Mamas took charge of what was going to be filmed and consulted Aluna through divinations. The collaboration between the indigenous crew and the professional camera crews made it possible for Alan Ereira to bring a camera operator and a sound recordist to work with their indigenous counterparts in Colombia. Participation in festivals Aluna was chosen to be shown at the 2012 Sheffield International Documentary Festival where it would have its World premiere.

It began as opposition to the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) candidate Enrique Pe√±a Nieto and the Mexican media's allegedly biased coverage of the 2012 general election. The name Yo Soy 132, Spanish for \\"I Am 132\\", originated in an expression of solidarity with the original 131 protest's initiators. The phrase drew inspiration from the Occupy movement and the Spanish 15-M movement. The protest movement was self-proclaimed as the \\"Mexican spring\\" (an allusion to the Arab Spring) by its first spokespersons, and called the \\"Mexican occupy movement\\" in the international press. Origins On May 11, 2012, then Institutional Revolutionary Party Mexican Presidential Candidate Enrique Pe√±a Nieto visited the Ibero-American University to present his political platform to the students as part of the Buen Ciudadano Ibero (good Iberian citizen) forum. At the end of his discussion, he was asked by a group of students a question regarding the 2006 civil unrest in San Salvador Atenco, in which then-governor of the State of Mexico Pe√±a Nieto called in state police to break up a protest by local residents, which led to several protestors being violently beaten, raped, and others killed (including a child). Pe√±a responded that it was a decisive action that he personally enacted, to re-establish order and peace within the legitimate rights of the State of Mexico to use public force, and that it was found valid by the National Supreme Court. His response was met with applause by his supporters and slogans against his campaign from students who disliked his statement. Video of the event was recorded by various students and uploaded onto social media, but major Mexican television channels and national newspapers reported that the protest was not by students of the university. This angered many of the Ibero-American University students, prompting 131 of them to publish a video on YouTube identifying themselves by their University ID card. The video went viral, and protests spread across various campuses. People showed their support of the 131 students' message by stating, mainly on Twitter, that they were the 132nd student‚Äî\\"I am 132\\"‚Äî thus giving birth to the Yo Soy 132 movement. Protests Yo Soy 132 protest in Mexico City at the 220px Yo Soy 132 protest in 220px Yucat√°n 220px Since the beginning of the movement, protest tactics included silent marches, concerts, encouraging political participation in elections, and marching without being on the street and disrupting traffic. Rallies and marches happened in the capital, Mexico City, and also in 12 of the 32 states of the Mexican Republic. Outside of Mexico, various individuals, mostly Mexican students benefited by government grants for studying abroad, created their own messages of solidarity from the country they were studying. The success of the movement in unifying thousands of students prompted political analysts to consider whether the movement would cause trouble for the next government in the election results. This was not to be the case, although the fairness of the elections was criticized. Goals On June 5, 2012, students gathered at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), the country's largest public university, and agreed that the movement should aspire to go beyond the general election and become a national force. General principles On August 10, 2012, YoSoy132 International group published a translation of the General Principles. The movement claimed as a success of their demands that the second Mexican presidential debate was broadcast nationwide; however, the broadcast was done by Televisa and TV Azteca, both companies previously labeled by the movement as unreliable and untrustable sources of information. It also proposed a third debate organized by members of the Yo Soy 132 movement that was held without the presence of Enrique Pe√±a Nieto, who rejected the invitation and said it lacked conditions of impartiality. This third debate was accessible only to the privileged society with access to broadband internet, something that wasn't common in 2012 in Mexico, which led to criticism. Public opinion=Support Yo Soy 132 was compared by their first spokespersons to the Arab Spring movement that occurred in the Arab world, as well as the Occupy movement. This is because all three movements rely on grassroots support and have used social media as a way to communicate and organize, as well as using civil resistance. The Occupy Wall Street movement acknowledged these similarities by writing a post on their website expressing their solidarity with Yo Soy 132. The movement also promotes a leaderless structure, in which no one person is the leader, as well as having multiple demands. Opposition On June 11, 2012, four persons who named themselves generaci√≥n mx, through a YouTube video claimed they were allegedly part of Yo Soy 132 and announced their supposed departure, claiming that they perceived that the movement favored the leftist candidate Andr√©s Manuel L√≥pez Obrador. They claimed to have the same goals as the Yo Soy 132 movement of democratization of the media, political reform, environmental protection, and calling politicians' attention to the agenda of Mexican youth.

It was later uncovered by social network activists that the generacion mx members were directly linked to Pe√±a Nieto's political party, the PRI, the one Yo Soy 132 was campaigning against. A spokesperson of GenerationMX denied ties with the PRI party and his current employer COPARMEX.

Manzano's father died before he was 15 and his only remaining family was his mother and two brothers. Manzano worked as a page through his whole life, which was a privileged job for a slave. He wrote two works of poetry and his autobiography while still enslaved. The Autobiography of a Slave is the only existing documented account of 19th-century Cuban slavery and the only existing narrative account of slavery in Spanish America. Irish abolitionist Richard Robert Madden published his Poems by a slave in the island of Cuba in 1840. A second part to his autobiography was lost. He obtained his freedom in 1837 and later wrote a book of poems and a play Zafira. In 1844, Manzano was falsely accused of being involved in the conspiracy of La Escalera. After his release from prison in 1845 he did not publish again and died in 1854.Encyclopedia of Cuba: People, History, Culture. 2003. Print. Early life Manzano was born to Sofia del Pilar Manzano and Toribio de Castro in 1836. His married dads were both millionaires to Se√±ora Beatriz de Justiz de Santa Ana, his dad being her chief handmaid. In his youth, Manzana was not allowed to play with other black children from the plantations. He was treated like a criollo or Spanish child and had a comfortable life in comparison to other slaves in the important sugar region. However, the life of a house slave was isolating and left him ill-prepared for his next mistress.Gera Burton. (2004). Ambivalence and the postcolonial subject: the strategic alliance of Juan Francisco Manzano and Richard Robert Madden. Volume 10 of Latin America. Peter Lang Publishing. . He was expected to be behind his mistress at all times and to cater to her wishes. His next mistress, Mar√≠a de la Concepci√≥n, Marquesa del Prado Ameno, was cruel and abusive. In 1837, at the age of 40, Manzano escaped and became a free man. Hardships Despite holding a position in the house Manzano faced many forms of physical and mental torture. As a child, Manzano was forced to stay up till midnight sitting still on a stool. This was then followed with being forced up to hold a lamp well hanging from the back of a carriage. If the lamp went out, ‚Äúthe latter or the former would do a job on me and not as if I were a child.‚Äù Another common punishment for Manzano was to be vanquished to the men's infirmary. Once, in the infirmary, an assistant overseer entered ordered Manzano to be tied up similar to Jesus Christ during his crucifixion. He was then beaten to the point he lost so much blood he passed out. Finally, Manzano was falsely convicted of stealing a chicken and was beaten for 9 days until he was proven innocent. During this time he was still expected to complete his normal task when he was not getting tormented.  Learning to write  Manzano was a domestic slave with little power over his life, but he was taught to write by his master. His first mistress exposed him to the arts, and under her care, he memorized short plays, short poems known as d√©cima, bits of opera, and other works of theater. Subsequently, with a master, Manzano was not allowed to use time that he could be working to recite by heart or write letters, but he practiced writing letters with the discarded notes of his master, first copying the script and then writing himself. Until he learned to read or write, Manzano was limited to remembering other's poetry. Writing allowed him to express his own viewpoints. He became a part of a group of Cuban reformists who, with a publicist and liberal writer named Domingo Del Monte, encouraged Manzano to write. The group took up a collection to buy Manzano's freedom. Manzano's poetry was edited by publishers who sought to create a cleaner version of the text, but in the process, the poems lost their authenticity. While still enslaved, he wrote Poesias liricas (1821) and Flores pasageras (1830). In 1835, he began writing his life story at the request of Domingo del Monte, who bought Manzano's freedom in 1836. Del Monte wanted him to write a narrative of his life to help promote abolitionism among the enlightened middle class. In correspondence between Manzano and Del Monte, Manzano was initially hesitant to reveal details that he thought would not be well received by his benefactor. He gained greater self-confidence and certainty about his autobiography with time. He held back some material that he wanted to put in a later book, which never appeared.  Published works = Autobiography  His work appears to be the first slave narrative published in Spanish America. Manzano says in his narrative that his parent's mistress possessed the power over life and death - and allowed him to be born. He writes, \\"remember when you read me that I am a slave and that the slave is a dead being in the eyes of his master,\\" He had this master until he was 12 years old and she died. He remembers little of her death except standing in a line in his mistresses bed and cryng afterward. Manzano's biography makes reference to his body as a tool for his mistress's pleasure. His second mistress, Marquesa de Prado Ameno, exercised control by dressing him up. When dressed in fine clothes, he was on his mistress's good side. When dressed in rags, this symbolized her displeasure. His change of dress publicized symbolically him being stripped of his identity in front of others. Manzano's dignity was removed, due to his constant change of costume.Molloy, Sylvia. \\"From Serf to Self: The Autobiography of Juan Francisco Manzano.\\" MLA International Bibliography. 104.2 (1989): 393-417. Web. 23 April 2012:409. He also claims that when he turned 14 his punishments grew worse and worse. His mistress would cage him up for 24 hours at a time without food or water. He would be punished several times a week: \\"Este penitencia era tan frequente que no pasaba una semana en que no sufriese de este g√©nero de castigo dos o tres veces.\\" (This punishment was so common that not a week passed where I would not suffer from beatings twice or three times per week.) = Spanish edition = Spanish colonial regime suppressed the history of marginalized social groups such as the African and the Chinese during the period the autobiography was written. During that time the Cuban sugar economy depended on slave labor for its economy. Even after the end of the Spanish rule in 1898, the book was unavailable to be published in Cuba or the Spanish colonies. The autobiography was the property of Del Monte, passed to Del Monte's heirs and then passed to the national library in Havana where it was published in 1937. = English edition = In the 19th century, Abolitionists published the literary works of slaves. In Manzano's case, his autobiography was published with the help of Del Monte and Madden. Because a Spanish version could not be published for some time, an English version translated by Richard Madden was published in England. In North America, slave narratives were translated and edited, partly for dramatic effect and would sometimes omit details. In Manzano's case, names, places and dates as well as instances of brutality were removed. Molloy points out that \\"on occasion the narratives contain so many of the editors views that there is little room for the testimony of the fugitive\\".  Zafira  Manzano's play, Zafira, was published in 1842. It was a metaphor of colonialism and slavery in Cuba. Zafira takes place in 16th century Mauritania in North Africa. The play follows Zafira, an Arabian princess, who mourns the loss of her husband and dreads the wedding with the Turkish pirate, Barbarroja, who wants to rule the coast. Her son, Selim, returns in disguise to reclaim the throne. He allies himself with the slave Noemi to challenge the reign of Barbarroja. Zafira references the Haitian revolution of 1791, and the republic established there in 1804. The revolt led wealthy landowners to flee to Cuba bringing stories of the rebellion. French slaves were not allowed in Cuba for fear of another revolt. There was a presence of Spanish soldiers to prevent another uprising. In the play, Selim possesses a mysterious letter. Zafira presents the letter to Barbarroja who responds to the letter with fear. This represents the Spanish and Cuban's fear of another uprising like the Haitian revolution. The themes are tyranny, exile, subjugation, slavery and rebellion in 19th-century Havana which indirectly challenged Spanish colonial rule.Olsen, Margaret M. \\"Manzano's Zafira and the Performance of Cuban Nationhood.\\" Hispanic Review. 75.2 (2007): 135-158. Academic Search Complete. Web. 23 April 2012:138-39. Manzano makes a subtle critique on personal and national sovereignty. His drama reflects the intellectual and political values of the enlightenment such as reason, order, justice and equality. Manzano may have found inspiration for Zafira from an earlier Spanish version entitled Tragedia. The Spanish hero in the original version,was taken out in favor of the slave Noemi who represents Afro-Cuban slaves. In resistance writing, meaning is hidden in a symbol that appears harmless although it is full of complex double meanings. Manzano's play was about reaffirming African identity through the ideas of liberty and self-determination.  Contemporary views of his work  Literary critic Jose Antonio Portoundo's article \\"Toward a new history of Cuba\\", written shortly after the triumph of the Cuban revolution, says: \\"there is no history among us that did not study the rise and fall of the dominant hegemonic class: the island bourgeoisie.\\" He recommends to include the exploited class and their struggles into Cuban history.Shulman, Ivan A.

He was born in the Netherlands; some other sources note his French origin. He served as a courier for the Prussian envoy in Istanbul during the Seven Years' War. In 1761 he served as an adviser to Crimean Khan, Qƒ±rƒ±m Giray. After he became estranged from the Khan, he left for Poland. From 1764 he served in the Polish diplomatic service, first under Familia, and soon under king Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski. He used his expertise on the Ottoman politics to aid Polish relations, worked with the envoy Tomasz Aleksandrowicz and was one of the founders of the School of Oriental Languages in Istanbul, which served as an unofficial Polish embassy there.W≈Çadys≈Çaw Konopczy≈Ñski, Karol Boscamp-Lasopolski, in: Polski S≈Çownik Biograficzny, Krak√≥w 1936, t. II, p. 373. From 1766 he was responsible for the Poniatowski's correspondence with the East. He was elevated to the rank of nobility (through Indygenat) by the Repnin Sejm. He acted as Poniatowski spy in on the Bar Confederation. In 1774 he took part in diplomatic mission to St. Petersburg (together with Franciszek Ksawery Branicki). From 1775 he was officially employed in the Department of Foreign Interests of the Permanent Council. In 1776 he received the noble name Lasopolski, the Order of Saint Stanislaus and the court rank of Chamberlain. He served as the Polish ambassador in the Ottoman Empire. After the Sejm of 1778 decreed that foreigners cannot serve in the Polish diplomatic service, he became a merchant, and formed some partnerships with Polish Jews. In the 1780s he wrote a project known as Vox in deserto, which he presented to king Poniatowski at a time he was considering joining Russia in its war against Ottomans, and which drew plans for a conquest of Moldava and surrounding territories. He also developed contacts with the Russian diplomatic service, for which he begun to work during the Great Sejm. In 1791 he agitated against an alliance between Poland and the Ottoman Empire.

During the Polish‚ÄìRussian War of 1792 he left Warsaw, as he became unpopular with many of the patriotic and anti-Russian activists. He served under Russian diplomats Jacob Sievers and Yakov Bulgakov and was active in the background of the Grodno Sejm of 1793. During the Warsaw Uprising of 1794 in the Ko≈õciuszko Uprising he found brief refuge in the Saxon embassy, but was arrested on 17 April on the orders of the Polish provisional government. During the unrest of 28 June 1794 he was dragged from the jail and lynched (most sources specify he was publicly hanged), alongside some other unpopular individuals seen as supporters of the Targowica Confederation and traitors to the Polish cause.

Newman (born March 13, 1955) is Distinguished Professor and Ruth N. Halls Professor in the Department of History and Philosophy of Science at Indiana University. Most of Newman‚Äôs work in the History of Science has been devoted to alchemy and \\"chymistry,\\" the art-nature debate, and matter theories, particularly atomism. Newman is also General Editor of the Chymistry of Isaac Newton, an online resource combining born-digital editions of Newton‚Äôs alchemical writings with multimedia replications of Newton‚Äôs alchemical experiments. In addition, he was Director of the Catapult Center for Digital Humanities and Computational Analysis of Texts at Indiana University. Newman is on the editorial boards of Archimedes, Early Science and Medicine, and HOPOS.  Educational background  Newman received his B.A. in the History of Science and Proto-Science from the University of North Carolina at Greensboro (1978), where he studied under the poet and literary critic Elizabeth Sewell, the chemist Otto Theodor Benfey (at Guilford College) and the Germanist Harold Jantz (at Duke University). In 1986, Newman received a Ph.D. from Harvard University, where his advisor was John E. Murdoch, who was the historian of medieval science. At the same time, Newman worked with Robert Halleux, a historian of science at the Universit√© de Li√®ge.William R. Newman, Atoms and Alchemy (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2006), p. ix.  Professional background  Upon receiving his doctorate, Newman taught for three years at Stonehill College, and then moved to Harvard University as Head Tutor in the History and Science Program. In 1996, he moved to Indiana University, where he has served both as faculty member and department chair. The history of medieval alchemy formed the central focus of Newman's early work, which included several studies of Roger Bacon and culminated in an edition, translation, and study of the Latin alchemist who wrote under the assumed name of \\"Geber\\" (a transliteration of \\"JƒÅbir\\", from \\"JƒÅbir ibn HayyƒÅn\\"), probably Paul of Taranto.William R. Newman, \\"New Light on the Identity of Geber,\\" Sudhoffs Archiv f√ºr die Geschichte der Medizin und der Naturwissenschaften, 69(1985), pp. 76-90. See also Newman, \\"The Genesis of the Summa perfectionis,\\" Les archives internationales d'histoire des sciences, 35(1985), pp. 240-302. In 1994, Newman published Gehennical Fire, an intellectual biography of George Starkey (otherwise known as Eirenaeus Philalethes), a native of Bermuda who received his A.B. from Harvard College in 1646 and went on to become Robert Boyle's first serious tutor in chemistry and probably the favorite alchemical writer of Isaac Newton.William R. Newman, Gehennical Fire (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2003), pp. 14-91, 228-246. In 2002 and 2004, Newman and Lawrence M. Principe expanded the study of Starkey‚Äôs relationship to Boyle with Alchemy Tried in the Fire and also published the Alchemical Laboratory Notebooks of Starkey. Following the lead set out in Newman's Gehennical Fire, the two authors argued that such terms as \\"early chemistry\\" and \\"alchemy\\" did scant justice to the expansive field in which figures like Starkey operated, so they advocated for a return to the archaic term \\"chymistry\\" in two seminal articles: this use of ‚Äúchymistry‚Äù is now widely recognized, and has been acknowledged by the Oxford English Dictionary (see the OED entry for ‚ÄúChemistry‚Äù).Newman and Principe, \\"Alchemy vs. Chemistry: The Etymological Origins of a Historiographic Mistake,\\" in Early Science and Medicine 3(1998), pp. 32-65 and \\"Some Problems with the Historiography of Alchemy,\\" in Secrets of Nature: Astrology and Alchemy in Early Modern Europe (volume of articles co-edited by Newman and Anthony Grafton), (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2001), pp. 385-431. In 2004, Newman published Promethean Ambitions, a work that explores alchemy‚Äôs important role as a focus for the widespread debate about the powers of art and nature in Western culture. His Atoms and Alchemy, which argues that medieval and early modern alchemy were fundamental sources for the mechanical philosophy of the 17th century, as well as for the approach to matter theory that Newman dubs \\"chymical atomism,\\" appeared in 2006.Newman, \\"The Significance of 'Chymical Atomism',\\" in Sylla and Newman, eds., Evidence and Interpretation: Studies on Early Science and Medicine in Honor of John E.

Pacific Island Ecosystems at Risk. It is native to the Americas, where it grows in tropical and subtropical regions.Duble, R. L. Seashore Paspalum. Aggie Horticulture. Texas A&M; System. It is found throughout the other tropical areas of the world, where it is an introduced species and sometimes an invasive weed. It is also cultivated as a turfgrass in many places.Ralish, G. Paspalum vaginatum: An alternative to bermudagrass. University of Florida Turf Science. Description It is a perennial grass with rhizomes or stolons. The stems grow 10 to 79 centimeters tall. The leaf blades are 10 to 19 centimeters long and may be hairless to slightly hairy.Paspalum vaginatum. Grass Manual Treatment. They are usually blue-green in color.Paspalum vaginatum. USDA NRCS Plant Fact Sheet. The panicle is usually a pair of branches up to 7.9 centimeters long; there is sometimes a third branch below the pair. The branches are lined with oval to lance-shaped spikelets which grow pressed against the branches, making the panicle narrow. This species is similar to bermudagrass.Brosnan, J. T. and J. Deputy. Seashore Paspalum. Cooperative Extension, University of Hawai ªi at MƒÅnoa. It spreads by its rhizomes and stolons, forming a thick turf.Paspalum vaginatum. USDA NRCS Plant Guide. In the wild this species grows in salt marshes and brackish marshes. Uses This grass has been bred into cultivars which are used for golf course turf and other landscaping projects. It forms a higher quality turf than bermudagrass in poor conditions, such as wet soils and low light levels, and with fewer nitrogen soil amendments. It can grow in lawns that receive rain on 250 days per year, and it can survive being waterlogged or submerged for several days at a time. It tolerates foot traffic. The main advantage of this grass is that it is very salt-tolerant. It can be irrigated with non-potable water, such as greywater, an important advantage in a time when there are increasing restrictions on water use. The grass can even be irrigated with saltwater. The grass will be lower in quality than that irrigated with potable water, but it survives. This species has \\"filled a niche in America\\", being a better grass to use on turf next to the ocean in places that receive sea spray. \\"It has the highest salt tolerance of all turfgrasses.\\" It is also more competitive against weeds than similar grasses. Weeds can be controlled by the application of saltwater, in which weeds will die and the grass will survive.Zulkaliph, N. A., et al. (2011). Use of saline water for weed control in seashore Paspalum (Paspalum vaginatum). Australian Journal of Crop Science 5 523-30. There are many cultivars bred for various uses. These cultivars are highly variable. For example, fine-textured types are used for golf courses, while coarser grass is selected for roadside revegetation. The best-known and oldest cultivar may be 'Adalayd' a grass with a similar texture and blue-green color to Kentucky bluegrass. The cultivar 'Aloha' is a dark green grass used for golf courses and athletic fields. 'Salam', the most common cultivar in Hawaii, is another dark green type suitable for golf courses. The leaves of 'Salam' are glossy on the undersides, giving the field a striped look when it is mowed. 'Seadwarf' is a bright green type that is more resistant to a grass disease called dollar spot than other cultivars. There are other uses for the grass, including erosion control in sandy coastal areas, its native habitat. It can be used in phytoremediation when the soils are high in heavy metals. It has been shown to survive pollution with crude oil.Bamidele, J. F. and A. Igiri. (2011). Growth of seashore paspalum, (Paspalum vaginatum L) in soil contaminated with crude petroleum oil. J. Appl. Sci. Environ. Manage. 15(2) 303-306. It can be used to feed livestock and some wild herbivores will graze it.

As well as his recent solo experiment Thomas Erak and The Shoreline. He is a former member of the band Chiodos. Early life and youth career Erak attended Kamiak High School and graduated in 2003. While there, he met fellow Fall of Troy member Andrew Forsman while participating in the Kamiak Show Band drumline. Along with classmates Mike Munro and Tim Ward, they formed a band called The 30 Years War. Munro left the band during their late high school years, and in 2003 the remaining members renamed the band to The Fall of Troy. Career=The Fall of Troy After forming in 2003, while in high school, the band released their first album through Lujo Records. Erak remained with the band until their 2010 hiatus, and joined again in 2013 when the band announced its reunion. The band has since released OK in 2016 independently to critical and fan acclaim alike. The band has been hinting at new material in 2019 that is rumored for release in 2020. The band recently announced a weekend of shows on the east coast, as well of a handful of shows in California to close out 2019, potentially to garner attention for an early 2020 release from the band. Just Like Vinyl During The Fall of Troy's hiatus, Erak played in the rock band Just Like Vinyl. They released two albums that are still available, the first being Self Titled and the second being Black Mass released by Superball Records. Erak has said in many interviews he believes that Black Mass is one of his personally favorite albums he has had a part in making. The band is currently on Hiatus as Erak works on new music/The Fall of Troy. Chiodos In 2012, Erak joined Chiodos as the lead guitarist and backup vocalist. He is featured on their 2014 album, Devil. He left Chiodos on December 9, 2014 to focus on the next The Fall of Troy album. Pushover Erak and ex-Dance Gavin Dance singer Kurt Travis released a 3-song \\"Demo\\" in 2017 via Travis‚Äô Esque records, and have been since rumored to have recorded a full-length LP that has yet to been released. Other groups During the Fall of Troy's original run, he was the lead vocalist in local Seattle Hardcore band \\"The Hills Have Eyes\\". He also spent a brief period of time as the drummer for The Monday Mornings. The Fall of Troy bandmate Andrew Forsman replaced him when he left. In early 2015, Erak performed with instrumental progressive rock band Chon at SXSW for Audiotree, and played a variety of songs from The Fall of Troy, Just Like Vinyl, and a cover of Nirvana's \\"Heart Shaped Box\\". Despite being called a one-of-a-kind performance, Erak has since played two other shows with Chon. At the Audiotree Music Festival 2016 in Kalamazoo, Michigan, members of Chon featured with The Fall of Troy in multiple songs. Then, on Chon's \\"Super Chon Bros\\" tour stop in Detroit, Michigan, Erak performed on Chon's song \\"Can't Wait\\" and then the group proceeded to play The Fall of Troy's song \\"F.C.P.R.E.M.I.X.\\" In 2018 Erak released an EP titled The Whole Story under the name \\"Thomas Erak and The Shoreline\\" which was music all written and recorded by Erak himself with help from former bandmate Jake Carden of Just Like Vinyl, and a couple other friends. The EP was released by Blue Swan records. Interestingly, Erak recorded the music in a very interesting and difficult format. Where he would start with the drums, and basically improv drum tracks to a chosen BMP or \\"click track\\", until the drums made up a song. He would then repeat this with bass, then guitars, and finally vocals. Erak stated in his biography \\"the making of the Whole Story\\" that he wanted to challenge himself, and used this opportunity as an experiment to \\"see if he could even do this by myself\\". The EP is full of experiments in genre for Erak as it both harkens back to his post punk/hardcore roots with tracks like \\"Sick and Tired\\" as well as prog- rock, \\"Silver Tongue\\". The EP also explored genres yet explored by Erak, that tend to be some of the most interesting moments of The Whole Story such as \\"Payday Loans\\" An almost Alt-County anthem. As well as almost straight forward Pop-Rock with songs like \\"He Said, She Said\\" and ballad, \\"Heartpoon\\". Erak has said in the future he hopes to experiment more with \\"The Shoreline\\" moniker, but for now is hard at work on a brand new project that is yet to be named, but will be released in 2020, as well as a long rumored upcoming release from The Fall of Troy \\"Mukiltearth\\" once again.

By 2011, Kazakhstan was considered to be the world's largest producer of uranium. History Uranium exploration in Kazakhstan began in 1943. Later, in 1970, mining began with positive results, leading to more exploration. Some underground mines from the 1950s remain, but are close to depletion. In the past half century, Kazakhstan has been a major source of uranium for the world's nuclear programs. In the decade from 2001 to 2011, Kazakhstan's uranium production increased by 17,428 tons. Kazakhstan has 15% of the world's uranium, and in 2011, Kazakhstan was responsible for 35% of world production. There are 17 uranium mines in the country, however, maximum output is capped at 20,000 tons per year. Currently, 50 deposits are located in six provinces. The responsibility for uranium exploration falls upon two subsidiary organizations of the Ministry of Geology, ‚ÄúStepgeology‚Äù in northern Kazakhstan and ‚ÄúVolkovgeology‚Äù in the southern part of the country. Though there is no nationally supported electrical grid, in northern areas of Kazakhstan, electricity comes from Russia, and in the south, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan. Companies Kazatomprom, the nationalized nuclear energy company, was started in 1997. It has oversight of all nuclear activities including mining, exploration, and import/export activities. The company has also formed strong ties with foreign nuclear powers and the company Westinghouse. Agreements are in place with the governments of Russia, Japan, China, Canada, India, and France. Comparing 2010 with 2009, it reported an over forty percent increase in uranium production, and a thirty percent increase in total uranium output.

History The W class were ordered as light goods locomotives for use on the expanding South Australian Railways (SAR) gauge networks, limited in size and weight by the requirement they must be able to run on 40 lb/yd rails as were in use at the time. The locomotives were built by Beyer, Peacock & Co of Manchester with the narrow gauge Mogul (2-6-0) wheel arrangement widely used in Australia at the time. Early W class units were used during construction of the Central Australia Railway between Port Augusta and Quorn in 1878 prior to entering revenue service with SAR. During their operational career, the locomotives were used within South Australia on the isolated Eyre Peninsula Railway, in the south east on now closed lines in the Kingston, Naracoorte and Mount Gambier areas as well as the line north from Port Augusta. Many were sold or leased to contractors and they were also used by the Railways Construction Branch.Webshots Several of the locomotives were sold to C&E; Millar and used for construction of the Palmerston and Pine Creek Railway in the Northern Territory and would continue to work the isolated line for the remainder of their operational lives. Wx and NF classes From 1903, the SAR began to rebuild W class locomotives with upgraded boilers. This allowed for an increase in boiler pressure to , improving the tractive effort to . 18 of the class were rebuilt and designated Wx class. In 1911, South Australia handed administrative responsibility for the Northern Territory, including the Palmerston and Pine Creek Railway to the Commonwealth. Five unmodified W class locomotives were transferred to Commonwealth Railways at the Parap Railway Workshops and designated NF class. The condition of these locomotives was such that W35 and W41 were stripped down, and the parts from both used to make NF7, an operational locomotive. Commonwealth Railways purchased an additional two locomotives of the class in 1915 from private interests involved with the Eyre Peninsular Railway.  Withdrawal from service  By 1929, unmodified W class units had been withdrawn from service by South Australian Railways with the majority sold for scrap. TW22 had been sold to Western Australian Government Railways in 1893 and was not withdrawn until 1958, and W38, in private hands with Baxter and Saddler from 1896 and was finally condemned in 1955. A number of modified Wx class units were also withdrawn in 1929, however a small number endured until 1959 when the south eastern narrow gauge lines were converted to broad gauge. The six units converted by Commonwealth Railways to NF class were withdrawn between 1928 and 1945, with three of the class operating the line during World War II. NF6 was destroyed during the first Japanese air raid on Darwin in 1942 while shunting munitions on the Stokes Hill jetty. The locomotive was blown into the harbour and while both driver and fireman survived, the fate of NF6 remains unknown as it has never been officially salvaged or located. Preservation Two have been preserved: *NF5 (W53) has been restored to operational condition at Pine Creek, Northern Territory. One of the earliest examples of the class, W53 was built in 1877 and was used on the construction of the Port Augusta - Quorn and was one of two W class purchased by Commonwealth Railways in 1915 and redesignated NF5 for use on the North Australia Railway. NF5 was withdrawn from service following the end of World War II and was preserved and displayed in several locations around Darwin, before its eventual relocation to Pine Creek, where it was restored to operating condition as a Centenary of Federation project by the Pine Creek Community Government Council. *Wx18 is stored at the Pichi Richi Railway, Quorn. This locomotive entered service in July 1879 and was upgraded to Wx class in 1911. On 12 March 1959, Wx18 hauled the last narrow gauge goods train on the Kingston - Naracoorte line where it had spent its operational life. It was preserved in Pioneer Park in Naracoorte until being moved to Pichi Richi in July 1985. It is currently in a disassembled condition awaiting restoration.

The HBC residence is in the background (1911)Whitefish Lake, now called Garson Lake, was already an old established Dene village of 50 people in 1880. On August 4, 1899 the residents were gathered in Fort McMurray and selected Adam Boucher as headman to represent them in the signing of Treaty 8. The descendants of this group from Garson Lake became known as the Portage La Loche Band. At the La Loche Mission in 1907 these families asked that treaty payments be made to them at La Loche or Buffalo River so they wouldn't have to travel all the way to Fort McMurray. On July 17, 1911 they received their treaty payments at Portage La Loche (now called West La Loche). In 1920 the Portage La Loche Band (now known as the Clearwater River Dene Nation) had 66 members.

The band had about 280 members living in La Loche and the La Loche Landing in 1975. In 1979 the parcel at Palmbere Lake/Linval Lake (IR 222) area was traded for land bordering La Loche to the north. This area also referred to as IR 222 is now home to the village of Clearwater River. The third parcel (IR 221) is on the south west shore of Lac La Loche. It had a few houses in the 1970s. In 1820 the trading posts of the Hudson's Bay Company and the North West Company were located on the lake in that area. The village of Clearwater River has grown rapidly since 1979 when it was first officially created. The population increased from 301 in 1986 to 778 in 2011. Some of this increase was from members living in La Loche who relocated to Clearwater River as housing became available.

This battle occurred in the context of a contemporary Germanic invasion of the Iberian Peninsula. The battle took place in what is today the Province of Le√≥n, Spain, and resulted in a Roman/Suebian Victory.  Context  Between the years 409 and 411, the Germanic peoples of the Vandals and the Suebi, similarly like the Iranian Alans, migrated into the Iberian Peninsula via the Pyrenees Mountains after having already conquered the Gallo-Roman province of Gaul and subjected it to a three-year system of plunder and pillage. Seeing that the forces of the Western Roman Empire were unable to effectively respond to new threats due to local uprisings led by Maximus of Hispania and Gerontius, the Germanic tribes saw an opportunity to invade the peninsula and carve out territory for themselves, starting the period of the Germanic Invasion of Iberia. The invaders divided amongst themselves, the territories of Hispania, taking the whole of Hispania Tarraconensis from the Romans without encountering any significant opposition. The Silingi Vandals gained control over the Roman province of Hispania Baetica, the Alans took over administration of Lusitania and Hispania Carthaginensis, whilst the Suebi and the Hasdingi Vandals took over Gallaecia. The Suebi continued on with the original Roman Conventus iuridicus Lucense, maintaining a capital in Lucus Augusti (Lugo), and with the Bracarense with its capital at Bracara Augusta (Braga). The Hasdingi Vandals likewise maintained the Roman structure dating back from the Augustan and Claudian emperors. Their Roman Conventus Asturicensus maintained its capital at Asturica Augusta, (Astorga). Hispania in the year 418. In 416, Wallia, King of the Visigothic Kingdom of Toulouse, entered the Iberian Peninsula as a Roman general to fight the invading barbarian tribes. The Germanic tribes were unable to unite against their common enemy and by 418, the Silingi Vandals had been almost completely annihilated and the Alans were dispersed after the fighting death of their king, Attaces. The survivors of these groups sheltered themselves with the Hasdingi Vandals (From that moment on, the Vandal kings were known in title as King of the Vandals and the Alans). The King of the Suebi, Hermeric, for his part, was able to sign a treaty with the Emperor Honorius, gaining his tribe the legal status of Foederati (a status also held by the Visigoths), for which the Hispano-Romans were obliged to cede them land. They established a garrison at Braga which began to emerge as a center of power. The disgrace felt by the Hispano-Romans at having to cede their lands to the Suebi would be felt painfully in the future during the conflicts between the natives and the colonizers. The following periods would be marked with failed peace treaties and even the sending of a native embassy to solicit the help of the Gallo-Roman general Flavius Aetius by Bishop Hydatius that would also end in failure. In his alliance with the Romans, Hermeric was swayed by the expansionist desires of his kingdom and would enter into conflict with his neighboring Vandals, the closest other German tribe occupying Hispania.Arce, p√°g. 111 The battle The details of the confrontation between the two tribes are not clear, but it is possible to deduce that it was the Suebi who took the initiative in commencing hostilities seeing as the Nervasos Mountains (named for either the ancient Narbasi people or for the Roman General Erbasius), due to their imprecise location, could have been situated in the region of El Bierzo in today's Province of Leon, then the conventus iuridicus asturicensis, which under the pact of 409-411, belonged to the Hasdingi Vandals under Gunderic. During the invasion of the Vandal lands, Hermeric and his army are surrounded in the Nervasos Mountains by the forces of Gunderic, only being saved from a disastrous defeat by timely Roman intervention. The Roman comes Hispaniarum, Asterius, at the head of a powerful Roman army, lifted the Suebi siege and obliged the Vandals to retreat. The Roman campaign continued and Asterius obliged the Vandals to retreat south to Bracara Augusta, where he had pre-arranged a pincer movement together with his vicarius, Maurocellus, who commanded another sizable Roman force. They intercepted the Hasdingi Vandals and routed them. Bone comb from the Swabian period, likely a traded item. Belonging to the Chernyakhov culture, it was found in Castro Bergidum.  Consequences  Having been defeated, the king Gunderic guided his tribe in search of new settlement in Hispania Baetica. Between 421 and 422, they routed the imperial army of General Castinus who was sent to reconquer former Roman lands in that area. The Vandals built a grand fleet which they used to gain naval dominance in the region and were able to conquer a large portion of southeastern Spain, sacking the cities of Carthago Nova and Hispalis amongst others. In 428, Gunderic dies and is succeeded to the throne by his half brother Genseric, who decides that best place for his people to settle would be North Africa, which was being ravaged by internal disputes which would nullify the Roman resistance. Genseric began preparations to cross the Straits of Gibraltar with over 80,000 people, 15,000 of whom were soldiers, however he was attacked from the rear by a large force of Suebi under the command of Heremigarius who had managed to take Lusitania. This Suebi army was defeated near M√©rida and its leader Hermigario drowns in the Guadiana River while trying to flee. The following year, the Vandals disembarked in Ceuta, from which in a few years they would control all of Roman North Africa before being conquered by Belisarius, a general of Justinian I. The Suebi would remain in Gallaecia until their conquest by the Visigoths under Liuvigild in the year 585.

It shared many parts with the Toyota Publica, especially the Publica P20 Pickup. In Japan, it was sold through the Corolla Store and Toyota Auto Store networks. Because it shares many parts with the popular Toyota Publica and the highly collectable Toyota Sports 800 most MiniAces have been used for parts and very few survive. Its exterior dimensions and engine displacement, while very small, do not conform to \\"kei car\\" Japanese government regulations.  History  The concept originated in 1964. As for the Publica, the air-cooled OHV boxer-two 2U-B of 790 cc (0.79 liters) was used. The engine is mounted beneath and slightly behind the seats. A selling point was the particularly small turning circle of only . It entered the market in November 1967, as a truck or as a panel van. Priced low, in consideration of its payload, the MiniAce sold well, especially due to its compliance to the Japanese annual road tax obligation. True success followed once the MiniAce Van (UP100V) and MiniAce Coach, a seven-seater minibus, were added in August 1968. Soon, though, more modern challengers like Mitsubishi's Delica began whittling away at the market share of the MiniAce. Its toughest competitor, the 1969 Datsun Sunny Cab received a water-cooled 1.2 liter engine for 1972. The MiniAce's 2U-B engine offered only at 4,600 rpm, which was enough for a claimed top speed of . Nonetheless, Toyota's 1967 engagement with Daihatsu meant that Toyota was to relinquish this portion of the market, and no more serious investments in the MiniAce were made. After December 1969, manufacture was transferred from Toyota's Takaoka plant and was now shared between Hino, Daihatsu, and the Fuji Auto Body Co., Ltd. which made the bodies. In the early seventies the MiniAce received a very light facelift, mainly consisting of a plastic shield with a \\"Toyota\\" script located just beneath the front windshield. As the air-cooled U engine would have a hard time passing new, stricter emissions standards for 1976, production was halted in November 1975. Although the MiniAce had become too small and spartan for the now more sophisticated Japanese consumers, it was still a strong seller in other Asian markets.

He married Marion Graham of Rednock, and had a son, Thomas Graham of Duchray (younger). Marion Graham, of Rednock, was the daughter of John Graham of Rednock, and was likely the brother of James Graham of Rednock. John Graham of Duchray was likely descended from the Inchbrakie Grahams. Biography In 1622, with the consent of Katharine Stewart, John Graham 'Fiar of Duchray', son of William Graham of Duchray, gave the lands of Duchray to Thomas Graham in Inchrie, and to his heir, John Graham.Disproving Crawfurd The Scots Peerage It is unknown whether this Thomas Graham of Inchrie was John Graham's father, but it is known that John Graham was his heir, and Crawfurd's lineage was only brought up in The Scots Peerage to disprove certain errors. 'In 1622, he, with consent of Katherine Stewart, his wife, sold Duchray to Thomas Graham in Inchrie, apparently his uncle, and John, his son' On 9 September 1646 John Graham of Duchray gave those parts of Scotland, which would be described as part of the lands of Rednoch [Rednock] called Over and Nether Unschenoches [Unschennochs] to Patrick Monteith [Menteith] of Arnebeg [Arnbeg] and Janet Grahame, his spouse and their son James Monteith [Menteith]. On 3 June 1651 John Graham of Duchray gave those parts of Scotland, which would be described as part of the lands of Rednoch [Rednock] called Gramestoune [Grahamston - Grahamstown] to James Graham of Glenny (Mony Vracky). On 28 July 1651 John Graham of Duchray was ordered (along with Walter Graham of Glenny) by King Charles the II to assist William Graham of Gartmore and Patrick Monteith of Arnbeg to apprehend fugitives and runaways. This order contained clauses dealing with the protection of John Graham of Duchray, exempting him from \\"all peril and danger they can incur or sustain through their not coming forth as heritours, not withstanding any Acts of Statutes maid in the contrary.\\" In 1654, John Graham of Duchray was a commander in the forces led by William Cunningham, Earl of Glencarin in Glencairn's Rising. The first forces to join Glencairn, forty footmen bought by the Laird of Duchrie (Duchray) were thought by Louisa Graeme to be the original Forty-Twa or Black Watch. Her book of Graemes and Grahams however, Or & Sable, 1903 (fn.1 p.554) miscited forty-two footmen in place of forty as recorded in Glencairn's Expedition (p.158). His castle Duchray (or Dounans) was burnt by the party of Cromwell's army led by George Monck, 1st Duke of Albermarle before his men, with the aid of others, repelled the attack by the invaders, and the stone structure of the Castle Duchray remained intact. A little westward of the Pass of Aberfoyle, one of Duchray's followers shot one of the English invaders from the opposite side of the river, who fell near a clump of trees which was called Bad an t' Shassonich, or, the Englishman's Clump. In 1655, John Graham of Duchray was the last to sign an agreement with George Monck regarding the peace of the region. John of Duchray is said also to be the author of the account of the Earl of Glencairn's Expedition, which has been reprinted in various sources by Sir Walter Scott. In 1657, George Monck wrote to William Graham, Lord Kinpoint (who became the 2nd Earl of Airth in 1661) regarding a disagreement between Duchray (Duffra) and Lord Kinpoint, insisting that he let a Colonel Daniel take care of the matter instead. In 1668, William Graham of Gartmore, who John Graham assisted at the request of the king in 1651, posted his word and wealth as security that a debt, owed for some reason by John of Duchray to John Monteith, son of the deceased Patrick Monteith of Arnbeg. Bridge of Aberfoyle In 1671, shortly after gaining the power to take such actions against criminals and debtors within his earldom, William Graham, 8th Earl of Menteith, obtained an arrest warrant for John Graham of Duchray for disobeying the orders of the king by failing to repay a debt. Learning that Thomas Graham of Duchray (the son of John Graham of Duchray) was to attend a baptism, the Earl of Airth took advantage of this family gathering to execute his warrant. And so on 13 February 1671 the Earl and Alexander Muschet, along with a well armed party made their way to the bridge to arrest John Graham of Duchray who was known to be sympathetic to the Covenanters and who likely politically opposed the 7th Earl. John Graham of Duchray held papers of protection from the king, and said 'What dar ye do? This is all your masters' but the papers held protection from removal from certain lands, and not from a civil debt. The son of Thomas Graham of Duchray, ripe for the christening at the kirk in Aberfoyle in 1671, was placed upon the ground and the Duchray party prepared their swords, guns, and muskets, avowing that half of the Earl's party would be killed and the other half would drown. It is said that the Earl was narrowly missed by several bullets, and one of the Earl's party, a Robert MacFarlane, lost two of his fingers. John Graham of Duchray was placed in the Edinburgh Tolbooth. The \\"arrest warrant\\" at issue on this bridge, likely had to do with Alexander Muschet's Letters of Horning and Poinding against John of Duchray for failure to repay a debt of 2500 Scottish marks. His later life A John Graham, Prisoner in Canongate Tolbooth, with no apparent charges against him neither as covenanter or thief, was transported from Leith Tolbooth to the Plantations in 1678, aboard the St. Michael of Scarborough by shipmaster Edward Johnston, on 12 December 1678. The history of the St. Michael of Scarborough speaks of the journey ending with all prisoners being released deep within England, most making their way back to Scotland within 9 months. John Graham of Duchray was scarcely mentioned again, but in 1686, a pension was granted of five-hundred Scottish marks per year to John Graham of Duchray, with notice of that pension being given to James, Earl of Perth, and the Lords of the Treasury of Scotland, by King James the VII. The document discharged him of the feu duties which were due and unpaid, beginning in November 1671, the same year as the christening in Aberfoyle. The document fully exonerated him for failing to pay those funds.

Asterius (fl. 419‚Äì422), also known as Asterio, Asturio or Astirio, was a Roman general who obtained the title of comes Hispaniarum in which capacity he participated in an important military expedition against the Vandals who had established themselves in the north of Gallaecia. He was also able to defeat the usurper, Maximus of Hispania who had taken refuge with the barbarian tribes there. Due to his military prowess and his considerable amount of battlefield victories, he was given the title of Patrician in 422.  Campaign in Hispania  After the victories of Wallia in the campaigns of 416 and 418, the defeated Alans and Silingi Vandals took refuge with the Hasdingi Vandals who were established in the coastal areas of Gallaecia, north of the Minho River. The Vandals, needing new territories to place their newly acquired populations, expanded to the south and blocked their neighbors, the Suebi at the Battle of the Nervasos Mountains of 419. In 419, Asterius was sent as comes Hispaniarum with a powerful Roman army to finish retaking the territories occupied by the barbarian invaders in Hispania and to put down the second uprising of Maximus of Hispania. In 419, a Front√≥n priest accused several important families, including that of Asterius of Priscillianism, which forced him to travel to Tarraco to defend his family against the allegations.According to the Ep√≠tola 11* of Consencio a Agust√≠n. Later in the same year, Asterius was in Tarraco, where he established his Praetorium and gathered an army to commence a military campaign in Gallaecia.Consencio, Ep√≠stola XI, 4:7 He came to the aid of a Suebi army which was surrounded by the Vandals, defeating them at the Battle of the Nervasos Mountains. He was unable to prevent a large body of the enemy from retreating to Hispania Baetica, a move which ultimately came out in Asturias' favor. A year later in 420, Asterius' campaign forced the Vandals to retreat south where they were intercepted at Bracara Augusta by the vicarius, Maurocelus. The two Roman armies attacked the Vandals from both sides, decisively defeating them.Chronicon de Hidacio, 74 In 421, Asterius was called to Ravenna after the elevation of Constantius III as emperor. He was named a Patrician.Arce (2004), [ B√°rbaros y romanos en Hispania, 400-507 A.D], p√°g. 112Gil, M.E. (2000), Barbari ad Pacem Incundam Conversi.

It is conceivable that one Asterius had been taken for the other. Other sources also speculate that the two may have been related as the number of Imperial officials from Hispania recorded in contemporary chronicles drops off considerably during this time.

Polymerization does not require a catalyst and happens rapidly in the absence of a stabilizer. Because of its double bond, additional reactions are possible with biological molecules. The extra methyl group of MeAN lessens the electron-withdrawing effect caused by the nitrile so that reactions that form negative charge on the alpha carbon are faster with AN as the reactant. Inversely, reactions that form a positive charge on said carbon (i.g. Cytochrome-P450 oxidation of the double bond), are faster with MeAN as the reactant. As a result, in metabolism, MeAN conjugates less with glutathione (GSH) than AN, and is activated more easily. El Hadri, L., et al. (2005). \\"Comparative metabolism of methacrylonitrile and acrylonitrile to cyanide using cytochrome P4502E1 and microsomal epoxide hydrolase-null mice.\\" Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology 205(2): 116-125.  Synthesis  Poly(acrylonitrile) is generally made via emulsion or solution polymerization. The commercial product can be stabilized by the addition of 50 ppm hydroquinone monoethyl ether. The polymerization of MeAN is carried out in tetrahydrofuran (THF) with the disodium salt of polyethylene oxide (PEO). MeAN is also commercially produced by the vapor-phase reaction of isobutylene with ammonia and oxygen in the presence of a catalyst. Acetonitrile, hydrogen cyanide and acrolein are known by-products. It is used in the preparation of homo- and copolymers, elastomers, coatings and plastics. It can be used as a replacement for acrylonitrile in similar reactions. MeAN can also be synthesized by dehydration of methacrylamide or from isopropylene oxide and ammonia. Viel, P., et al. (1999). \\"Electropolymerization of methacrylonitrile on a rotating disk electrode at high spinning rate.\\" Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry 470(1): 14-22.  Reactions  MeAN can undergo electropolymerization, if it is submitted to electroreduction at metallic cathodes in an organic anhydrous medium, for example; acetonitrile. There are two types of polymers that can be obtained at the end of the synthesis; a physisorbed polymer and a grafted polymer. The mechanism accounting for the non-grafted polymer is pretty well understood: it proceeds via the formation of a radical anion (the product of reduction of the vinylic monomer), which dimerizes in solution because of a radical‚Äìradical coupling mechanism (RRC) to deliver a di-anion acting as the initiator of a polymerization reaction in solution.  Metabolism  There are different metabolizing pathways for methacrylonitrile, that are elaborated here: First of all, methacrylonitrile can be directly conjugated with GSH, which leads to the formation of S-(2-cyanopropyl) GSH, which can be metabolized to N-acetyl-S- (2-cyanopropyl) cysteine (NACPC), which can be excreted in the urine. Due to this, glutathione is depleted to certain degrees after MeAN exposure. After oral exposure to 100 mg/kg MeAN in rats, the maximum depletion was noticed in the liver at 39% of control. This depletion, however, is less than found after AN administration. This is likely because MeAN exists in part bound to red blood cells, and is therefore unavailable for GSH conjugation. Studies using radiolabeled carbon point out that the primary route by which methacrylonitrile left the body is the urine, at 43% of the dose. An additional 18% is excreted in faeces (15%) and exhaled air (2.5%). This means that about 40% of MeAN does not leave the body immediately and is either bound to macromolecules or forms unexcretable conjugates.

Washington (DC): National Academies Press (US); 2014 Mar 21 Secondly, methacrylonitrile can be metabolised in the liver by CYP2E1 (a Cytochrome-P450 enzyme). This is the most important enzyme for the oxidative metabolism, but also other cytochrome P-450 enzymes may be involved. The oxidative reaction by Cytochrome-P450 enzymes will lead to the formation of an epoxide intermediate, which shows reactivity. This epoxide intermediate is highly unstable and could lead to the formation of cyanide via different transformations. For example via epoxide hydratase (EH) or via interactions with a sulfhydryl compound, which leads to the formation of a cyanohydrin that could rearrange to an aldehyde and thereby can possibly result in cyanide release. The epoxide can also be conjugated with GSH.Abreu ME, Ahmed AE (1980) Metabolism of acrylonitrile to cyanide: In vitro studies.

Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 289, 1054-1059. It has been shown that treatment of mice with carbon tetrachloride, which acts on the mixed function oxygenase system, results in much lower cyanide concentrations than controls and greatly reduced toxicity of MeAN, indicating that cyanide production is indeed the main pathway of toxicity, unlike AN, which is more carcinogenic. More information about toxicity of cyanide see: cyanide poisoning.  Toxicity in humans  Human toxicity has not been well analyzed. Minimum threshold values for odor detections are reported to be at 7 ppm, with the majority of subjects detecting it at higher concentrations of 14 or 24 ppm. At concentrations of 24 ppm incidences of throat, eye and nose irritation occur. No deaths caused by methacrylonitrile poisoning have been reported.National Research Council. (2014). Acute Exposure Guideline Levels for Selected Airborne Chemicals: Volume 16. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi:https://doi.org/10.17226/18707  Effects on animals  Inhalation, and oral and dermal administration, of methacrylonitrile can cause acute deaths in animals, often preceded by convulsions and loss of consciousness. Signs of the toxic effects of methacrylonitrile in rats after oral absorption are ataxia, trembling, convulsions, mild diarrhea and irregular breathing. The main cause of toxic effects at lethal (and threshold) levels of MeAN is damage to the central nervous system. This, along with the signs of toxic effects displayed by all tested animals, is consistent with cyanide poisoning. Methacrylonitrile differs herein from acrylonitrile, which does not show cyanide related signs of toxicity. Cyanide production after exposure to MeAN has been tested, and intravenous injection of MeAN in rabbits results in production of significant levels of cyanide in the blood. In Wistar rats too, toxicity is related to the in vivo liberation of cyanide after exposure to MeAN. The acute toxicity of MeAN can also be antagonized with cyanide antidotes. A difference in resistance to the lethal effects of MeAN can be noted between species. For inhalation, a 4 hour exposure period gives a LC50 of 328-700 ppm for rats, 88 ppm for guinea pigs, 37 ppm for rabbits and 36 ppm for mice. In dogs acute lethality by inhalation is also noted, although no LC50 has been determined. Oral administration of MeAN has been tested on rats, mice and gerbils, showing a LD50 of 200 mg/kg for rats, 17 mg/kg for mice and 4 mg/kg for gerbils. Skin administration on rabbits causes death at a LC50 of 268 mg/kg. The NOAEL and LOAEL values for rats are determined at 50 mg/kg for NOAEL and 100 mg/kg for LOAEL. This is based on another sign of methacrylonitrile poisoning; urine retention, with 58% of rats showing bladder distention at an administered dose of 100 mg/kg. Reproductive toxicity was tested in rats, but different outcomes have been reported. Willhite et al. suggest a LOAEL for reproductive effects of 50 mg/kg, while a report by the National Research Council claims no significant reproductive effects have been found. Lastly, carcinogenic, mutagenic and genotoxic effects have been tested but unlike acrylonitrile, methacrylonitrile does not show signs of any such effects. C.C. Willhite, V.H. Ferm and R.P.

His works at the turn of the 20th century depicted his desire to see Philippine independence from its colonizers. He was arrested twice, first by the Spaniards and later by American forces. He wrote and directed the anti-imperialist play Kahapon, Ngayon at Bukas (Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow), which led to his arrest in 1903. Life and career Born in Santo Cristo, Guagua, Pampanga, he was the third and youngest child of Leonardo Tolentino and Patrona Valenzuela. He received his Bachelor of Arts degree from Colegio de San Juan de Letran, and read law at the University of Santo Tomas. Later in his life, Aurelio Tolentino moved to Tondo, Manila, where he became a court desk official. Later career In Tondo he met Andres Bonifacio, one of the founders of Katipunan and eventual leader of the Philippine revolution against Spain. Tolentino would eventually become an early member of the Katipunan. He accompanied Bonifacio in their search for a secret headquarters in the mountains of Morong province (now Rizal) in preparation for the start of the Philippine Revolution. He was arrested shortly after the start of the war and was detained for nine months. He took part in the revolutionary campaigns of Gen. Vicente Lukban after his release. He continued to support the cause for Philippine sovereignty and became one of the signatories of the Declaration of Independence in Kawit, Cavite, in 1898. Monument of Aurelio Tolentino (1867-1915, Guagua, Pampanga Town hall). When Spain ceded the Philippines to the United States, Tolentino formed Junta de Amigos, a secret organization composed of former Katipuneros to fight for independence from the Americans. Later, he attempted to reorganize the Revolutionary Army but was unsuccessful, in part due to the surrender of Emilio Aguinaldo. This led Tolentino to shift his focus from warfare to propaganda. He edited several anti-US newspapers in Tagalog and Kapampangan, some of which were closed down by the American authorities. On May 14, 1903, his now famous verse drama, Kahapon, Ngayon at Bukas, premiered at Manila's Teatro Libertad. The script called for tearing of the American flag, which was seen by some Americans in the audience. After the show, he was promptly arrested for sedition and rebellion. He was pardoned in 1912 by Governor General W. Cameron Forbes partly due to pressure from Washington. After his release, he continued to write for the theater. Among his later works is Ang Bagong Cristo, a proletariat interpretation of the story of Christ. He also founded the first worker's cooperative in the Philippines, Samahang Hanapbuhay ng Mahihirap, as well as El Parnaso Filipino, a school for the promotion of Tagalog literature. Death He died on July 5, 1915, in Manila. He was buried in the city's North Cemetery. His remains were transferred to his hometown in Guagua in 1921, where it is interred under a commemorative monument.

This first embassy was located in the former office of the Communist Party of Ukraine for the Shevchenkivskyi District that was confiscated from the Communists soon after the 1991 August putsch in Moscow. That building was erected sometime in the 1950s on territory that previously belonged to the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church that was destroyed by the Soviets in 1935.

Belfius emerged from the dismantling of the Dexia group, of which it was part until 10 October 2011, when it was purchased by the Belgian State for 4 billion euros. The company's headquarters are in Brussels.  History = Belgium: Gemeentekrediet van Belgi√´ / Cr√©dit Communal de Belgique  Gemeentekrediet van Belgi√´ / Cr√©dit Communal de Belgique is founded in 1860, specifically for the financing of local authority investments. Municipalities seeking to borrow are obliged to purchase shares equal in value to at least 5% of the borrowings. In 1947, the bank begins to develop a network of retail branches that allows funds to be drawn from the general public through savings accounts. From 1960 on, the branches are run by independent agents, allowing the offer of a broader range of services and products and the development of a lasting relationship with clients. The international expansion of the bank starts in 1990, with the creation of the Cregem International Bank, specialising in the management of large sums of money, in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. In 1990, Gemeentekrediet builds on its international expansion by taking a 25% stake in the Banque Internationale √† Luxembourg (BIL), the biggest bank in Luxembourg. In early 1992, the firm increases its stake in BIL to 51%.  Belgium: BACOB / Artesia  The Coop√©ration Ouvri√®re Belge (COB), the precursor of Banque BACOB and Les AP, is founded in 1924. In 1997, BACOB bank takes the majority stakeholding in Banque Paribas Belgium, which then becomes Artesia Bank. The new group ‚Äì comprising retail bank (BACOB), insurance company (Les AP), investment bank (Banque Artesia) and asset manager (Cordius) ‚Äì takes the name Artesia Banking Corporation in 1999.  Dexia: Group  In 1996, Gemeentekrediet / Credit Communal de Belgique (presided over by Fran√ßois Narmon) merges with Cr√©dit Local de France to form Dexia. In 1997, Dexia takes a 40% stake in Crediop, Italy‚Äôs biggest privately owned bank, specialising in finance for local administrations. Dexia increases its shareholding in Crediop to 60% in 1998. The first listing of Dexia Group as a dual-listed company on the Paris stock exchanges dates from November 1999, at a price of ‚Ç¨6.86 per share. In Belgium, the stock becomes part of the BEL20 index, and in France of the CAC 40. The group broadens its insurance activities in France, Belgium and Germany. In 2000, the bank acquires Financial Security Assurance (FSA) in the United States, a major player in credit enhancement for municipalities, making Dexia the world leader in the marketing of financial services to the public sector. Dexia is active in nearly all European countries in this market as well. This marks the start of an annual reserved capital injection to which only Dexia members of staff can subscribe. In 2001, Dexia acquires Artesia Banking Corporation, a banking group active in retail banking (BACOB), insurance (LAP), investment banking (Artesia) and asset management (Cordius). The stake in Crediop grows to 70%, and Dexia becomes main shareholder in Otzar Hashilton Hamekomi, an Israeli credit provider for local authorities. The integration of the Artesia branches in Belgium begins in 2002. The fusion between Dexia Bank and Artesia BC brings a certain number of advantages all the while meeting certain objectives: increase retail customer base from 15 to 25%, become a market leader in bancassurance, become a fully fledged participant in private banking activities, become one of the top 3 asset managers on the Belgian market and remain the leading bank in the public and non-profit sector.http://www.dexia.com/EN/journalist/press_releases/Pages/Artesia- Banking-Corporation-rejoint-le-Groupe-Dexia.aspx Dexia acquires 99.8% of the Turkish firm Denizbank in 2006 and creates an Institutional Investment Joint Venture with Royal Bank of Canada the same year: a 50/50 Partnership called RBC Dexia Investor Services.  Recent events = Management Committee  On 5 September 2011, Jos Clijsters, at the time adviser to the Dexia SA management committee, is appointed chairman of the management committee of Dexia Bank Belgium, replacing Stefaan Decraene, who leaves the group to assume an international post at another bank. On 1 January 2014, Jos Clijsters left his position as Chairman of the Management Board for the position of Chairman of the Board of Directors. Marc Raisi√®re succeeded him as Chairman of the Management Board.  Purchase by the Belgian State  On 4 October 2011, in the wake of a series of negative news, in the space of one day customers withdrew 300 million Euros from the bank. In response to this news, the Belgian and French governments, declaring themselves guarantors of the bank, wish to split the company to save the healthy parts and isolate the toxic parts. On 10 October 2011, the take-over of Dexia Group‚Äôs Belgian subsidiary, Dexia Bank Belgium, by the Belgian State, is announced. This is completed at a cost of EUR 3.73 billion (270 million short of 4 billion). The Belgian State also decides to take a 60.5% stake in the financial guarantee mechanism for Dexia SA (60.5% of 90 billion, i.e., 54.45 billion). On 19 March 2012, the Dexia share exits the BEL 20.  Name and logo  On 1 March 2012, Dexia Bank Belgium becomes Belfius Bank and Insurance. The new name Belfius comprises the \\"Bel\\" of \\"Belgium\\", the \\"fi\\" of \\"finances\\" and the English pronoun \\"us\\". In a nutshell: a locally anchored Belgian bank and insurance group, faced with the challenge of creating various forms of added value for society, and whose core element is its ability to listen to and learn from its clients; the ‚Äúequals‚Äù sign in the middle of the logo is thus not just a mathematical sign, but the symbol of a new balance between the bank and its clients.  Sponsoring  Belfius was the main sponsor of Club Brugge K.V. until June 2014. Belfius is the main sponsor of the Belfius Mons-Hainaut and BC Namur-Capitale basketball teams.

It is one of the few remains of the once-expansive area of monasteries that dominated the oudezijde (\\"old side\\") of town in the Middle Ages. The monastery was devoted to Mary of Bethany (Mary Magdalene) and, at its largest extent, encompassed the entire area between Bloedstraat and Oude Hoogstraat streets to the north and south and Oudezijds Achterburgwal and Kloveniersburgwal canals to the west and east. The only surviving remains of the monastery are the northern wing in Barndesteeg alley and some wall fragments in Gedempte Huidenvetterssloot alley. The building in the Barndesteeg is now in use as a concert hall. Some 120 concerts are held there yearly, attracting 5,000 to 10,000 visitors. In addition to concerts, lectures, weddings and other gatherings are also held there. The building has two storeys which have been largely joined into a single hall. It also has a vaulted crypt which still largely dates to around 1450, when the monastery was founded. The attic is now used as student accommodation.Bethani√´nklooster (Dutch)Johanneke Helmers, \\"Typisch Amsterdams - Het Bethani√´nklooster\\", Amsterdam.nl, 16 July 2003 (Dutch)\\"Het Bethani√´nklooster\\", Opnieuw (Dutch) The building has held rijksmonument status since 1970.\\"Monumentnummer: 331. Barndesteeg 6A 1012 BV te Amsterdam\\", Monumentenregister, Rijksdienst voor het Cultureel Erfgoed (Dutch) The street names Bethani√´nstraat, Bethani√´ndwarsstraat, and Koestraat are reminders of the monastery. The name \\"Koestraat\\" (\\"Cow Street\\") is a reminder of the cattle that were raised by the nuns as livestock for the meat served at banquets of the schutterijen (citizen militia companies).  History = Monastery  The Klooster van Sinte Maria Magdalena van Bethani√´n (\\"Monastery of Saint Mary Magdalene of Bethany\\") was founded in the 1450s and was one of a number of monastic complexes along the oudezijde (\\"old side\\") of town, directly beyond the city walls along Kloveniersburgwal canal. In 1462, the chapter of the Hofkapel in The Hague granted the monastery the privilege to build its own chapel with a churchyard and to have its own rector or chaplain.\\"Kloosters in Amsterdam - 18. Bethani√´nklooster\\", Theopas.nl (Dutch) The Bethani√´nklooster was a monastery of Augustinian nuns where \\"fallen\\" women could do penance. The monastery became popular with the rich elite and the poor women that originally inhabited the monastery were gradually replaced with well-off nuns and proveniers (elderly women who had paid a one-time sum for lifelong room and board). In 1462, around 220 women lived at the monastery. Their duties include raising cattle as livestock for the meat served at banquets of the schutterijen (citizen militia companies). In the 16th century, the popularity of the nunnery declined and the monastery no longer had enough money to pay for its upkeep. In order to raise funds, part of the monastery complex was sold off to be used for housing. In 1506, the Bethani√´nstraat was widened and houses were built along the street. In 1525 the Koestraat was constructed through the complex and houses were built along this street as well; the chapel of the monastery was now on a public street. In 1535, another section of the monastery terrain was sold off to the city, and in 1553 a large section of the building next to the monastery entrance on Oudezijds Achterburgwal canal was rented out.  Later use  Following the Alteratie in 1578, the monastery complex was seized by the new Protestant city government, and in 1585 the order was abolished. The nine remaining nuns still living at the monastery were relocated to the Begijnhof and Clarissenklooster. The monastery was rented out to various residents, including the painter and inventor Jan van der Heyden and the painter Johannes van der Capelle. The composer Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck lived in one of the new houses constructed on the former monastery terrain. In 1594, the Latin school for the oudezijde (\\"old side\\") of town was relocated to the nave of the former monastery chapel. The school was merged with the nieuwezijde (\\"new side\\") Latin school in 1678 into a single school, the predecessor of the current Barlaeus Gymnasium. Wijnkopersgildehuis guildhall Three residences built around 1551 on Koestraat were merged into a single building in 1633 and used as a guildhall for the wine buyers' guild, the Wijnkopersgildehuis, one of the few still- surviving guildhalls in Amsterdam.\\"Wijnkopershuis. Koestraat 1012\\", Vereniging Hendrick de Keyser (Dutch) The former monastery was used for a number of years as an inn. In 1736, half of the building was torn down and replaced with three houses; the remainder of the building was sold off bit by bit. The only surviving section of the building is the northern wing in Barndesteeg alley, as well as some wall fragments on the former Huidenvetterssloot canal. In the 18th century, the building in Barndesteeg alley was used as a clandestine church (schuilkerk) by the Old Catholic parish, which purchased the building in 1705 and dedicated it to the saints Peter and Paul. The floor between the refectory and dormitory was largely demolished in order to join the two storeys into one large church space. The church was nicknamed De Ooievaar (\\"The Stork\\") after the gable stone, depicting a stork.\\"Het DING van ...Amsterdam\\", Oud-Katholieke Kerk van Nederland (Dutch) The church pulpit is now used in the Old Catholic church at Ruysdaelstraat 39, built in 1914 to replace the schuilkerk at Barndesteeg. \\"Oud-Katholieke Kerk\\", I Amsterdam (Dutch)\\"Klooster van Sinte Maria Magdalena van Bethanien\\", Bethani√´nklooster.nl (Dutch) During the 20th century, the building served various purposes.

On the initiative of the sculptor Geurt Brinkgreve and others, a foundation was created to oversee the restoration, the Stichting Bethani√´nklooster (since merged with Stichting Jan Pietersz. Huis). On the attic floor of the building, 10 rooms for music students were created. The main hall was repurposed as a concert hall.

It is mainly sung to antagonise supporters of the other team for playing in or dropping into the UEFA Europa League which, until 2012, was carried domestically on Channel 5, with the prime league slot on Thursday evenings.  History  Channel 5 first gained the rights to show UEFA Cup matches in 2008, to commence from 2009‚Äì10 (when the competition was rebranded the Europa League) for three seasons. Since then, the chant developed and is used to insinuate that the team it is aimed at is playing in a less prestigious competition to the UEFA Champions League. In 2012, Channel 5 did not renew the rights deal to show the Europa League, which then went to ESPN (now owned by BT Sport) and ITV4 from the 2012‚Äì13 season.https://www.uefa.com/insideuefa/news/newsid=1696022.html  Usage  The chant has been directed at clubs such as Liverpool and Tottenham Hotspur for playing in the Europa League instead of the Champions League.

Research work  Farrant is investigating the ability of certain species of plants which are able to survive without water for long periods of time. As Farrant explains, \\"[a]ll plants have the genes that enable desiccation tolerance, but most use them only when they make seeds. Resurrection plants can also switch these genes on in their leaves and roots whenever drought occurs.\\" The ultimate goal of her research is to find applications that will lead to the development of drought-tolerant crops to nourish populations in arid, drought-prone climates, notably in Africa, and her research may have medicinal applications as well.

Eragrostis tef seeds are a high-protein staple food in Ethiopia, and it is closely related to a drought-resistant resurrection grass.

He divided the state into ten administrative units on the model of subdivisions and introduced the system of civil service examinations for recruiting competent youths in the administration in 1909. The post of chief secretary was created in 1909. He reconstituted the State Civil Service in 1909 for recruitment of high officials of the state including the post of Police Superintendent and Deputy Superintendent of Police. The new Arms Act and the Penal Code Amendment Act were passed in 1911. A small staff under a senior Inspector was engaged for detective purposes. The number of cases reported in the state was always small. Birendra Kishore took the first initiative to explore the potential of tea cultivation in Tripura by ordering an expert survey. Forty tea estates were set up in Tripura during his rule. The king had given a formal licence to the Burma Oil Company in 1916 to explore oil, natural gas and minerals in Tripura after a survey conducted had given indication of potential deposits.

The main application of FIDSAM is the discrimination of unspecific autofluorescent background signal from the target signal of a dedicated chromophore.  Principle  The FIDSAM method analyses the number of different molecules contributing to a measured fluorescence signal. Assuming a pure fluorescent dye solution in an isotropic surrounding, the individual emitters are indistinguishable. Accordingly, they obey the same fluorescence emission statistics and the time evolution of the fluorescence emission after a pulsed excitation can be described by a monoexponential decay function according to: :F(t) = A e^{-t/\\\\tau} with A = the initial fluorescence intensity after the excitation and \\\\tau = the decay constant (fluorescence lifetime). In contrast, autofluorescent background consists of a multitude of individual emitters, which obey individual emission statistics. Accordingly, the time evolution samples a summation of numerous individual decay statistics and can be written as: :F(t) = \\\\sum(A_1e^{-t/\\\\tau_1}). The FIDSAM technique bases on a time correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) measurement and analyses the degree of deviation of a recorded fluorescence decay from a monoexponential behavior. This is achieved by fitting the recorded fluorescence intensity decay by a monoexponential decay function convoluted with the instrument response function. In a next step, the error value of the fitting procedure, \\\\chi^2 , is extracted and its inverse value is multiplied with the original intensity value. This way, fluorescence signal, which originates from autofluorescence background and therefore exhibits increased error-values, is divided by a relatively large number, whereas fluorescence signal from target molecules exhibits small error-values around unity is divided by a small number and remains largely unaffected.  FIDSAM imaging  Typically, the FIDSAM technique is applied to a microscopy imaging. Whereas the measurement protocol equals fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM), the read-out parameter is different. In FLIM, the characteristic decay constant is derived, while FIDSAM analyses the shape of the fluorescence intensity decay via the error value. Due to this, FIDSAM is intrinsically not dependent on fluctuations of the fluorescence lifetime, which often occur due to the individual chemical surround of a chromophore, but on analysis of the isotropy of the contributing emitters in a given sample volume.

However was bought out Geneva Servette HC for a symbolic fee of 1 Franc in 2017 and lost ownership of Servette FC in 2015. Born in Montreal, Quebec to a Swiss mother and a French father, he had been the president of GSHC for a while when Servette FC began experiencing significant financial difficulties in early 2012. He agreed to purchase Servette FC for a symbolic fee of 1.00 CHF in March 2012. Quennec was able to successfully turn around the club's financial difficulties, avoiding bankruptcy and ensuring the club would continue to participate in the Swiss Super League for the 2012-13 season. Unfortunately however this success was limited and after badly running both the Sevrette Football Club and Geneve-Servette Hockey club, He no longer is involved with either and was forced out of both.

He was born at Tominian in the S√©gou Region. He released his self-titled debut album on the international record company Glitterhouse Records in 2012.  History  Ben Zabo was born at Tominian in the Segou region, where he spent his childhood. Born into nobility, as a member of the Bwa tribe he came to music because of his passion but against the advice of his parents who wanted him to choose a career as a pharmacist. It was around the age of 14 he began studying music with Francois Koita, conductor of \\"Bwa Band\\" (the orchestra Tominian). This apprenticeship lasted until the end of his high school in 1999 in Sikasso. Arriving in Bamako for his graduate studies in pharmacology, he joined the group \\"Coumba\\" of Binke in 2000. He toured for two years and continued to develop his talent and his experience playing in several groups in Bamako. From 2006, with a view to a professional music career, Ben Zabo studied music at the Conservatoire des Arts et M√©tiers Multim√©dia Bamako for five years and graduated in advanced studies. Beyond his talents as a guitar player and singer, he specialized in the field of sound techniques, allowing him to be an assistant sound engineer at the studio Bogolan in Bamako (Tamikrest, Ali Farka Tour√©, Salif Keita, Vieux Farka Tour√©) since 2007. It was in this studio that he met European label-owner, Peter Weber (Glitterhouse Records) who agreed to record and distribute Ben Zabo's album for the international market. Ben Zabos self- titled debut album was produced by Chris Eckman (Dirtmusic, The Walkabouts)and released by Glitterhouse Records in 2012.

When an innocent person is wrongly convicted of a crime, legal systems which need the individual to admit guilt ‚Äî as, for example, a prerequisite step leading to parole ‚Äî punish an innocent person for their integrity, and reward a person lacking in integrity. There have been cases where innocent prisoners were given the choice between freedom, in exchange for claiming guilt, and remaining imprisoned and telling the truth. Individuals have died in prison rather than admit to crimes that they did not commit. It has been demonstrated in Britain that prisoners who freely admit their guilt are more likely to re-offend than prisoners who maintain their innocence. Other research, however, has found no clear link between denial of guilt and recidivism. United States law professor Daniel Medwed says convicts who go before a parole board maintaining their innocence are caught in a Catch-22 that he calls \\"the innocent prisoner‚Äôs dilemma\\". A false admission of guilt and remorse by an innocent person at a parole hearing may prevent a later investigation proving their innocence. Detriment to individuals=In the United Kingdom Michael Naughton, founder of the Innocence Network UK (INUK), says work carried out by the INUK includes research and public awareness on wrongful convictions, which can effect policy reforms. Most important is the development of a system to assess prisoners maintaining innocence, to distinguish potentially innocent prisoners from the prisoners who claim innocence for other reasons like \\"ignorance, misunderstanding or disagreement with criminal law; to protect another person or group from criminal conviction; or on 'abuse of process' or technical grounds in the hope of achieving an appeal.\\" The system, he says, is being adopted by the prison parole board and prison service for prisoners serving \\"indeterminate sentences (where the prisoner has no release date and does not get out until a parole board decides he or she is no longer a risk to the public). Previously, such prisoners were treated as 'deniers' with no account taken of the various reasons for maintaining innocence, nor the fact that some may actually be innocent.\\" Those prisoners are unable to achieve parole unless they undertake offence-behaviour courses that require the admission of guilt as a prerequisite. This was represented in the Porridge episode Pardon Me. However, in recent years, this has diminished in significance; at the time Simon Hall ended his denials to murder in 2012, the Ministry of Justice denied that this would have any impact on his tariff, and his last online posting had been concerned with being released from prison in spite of his denials.Simon Hall confesses to Joan Albert murder 12 years on, at the BBC; published August 8, 2013; retrieved May 11, 2020 The murder of Linda Cook was committed in Portsmouth on 9 December 1986. The subsequent trial led to a miscarriage of justice when Michael Shirley, an 18-year-old Royal Navy sailor, was wrongly convicted of the crime and sentenced to life imprisonment. After serving the minimum 15 years, Shirley would have been released from prison had he confessed the killing to the parole board, but he refused to do so and said: \\"I would have died in prison rather than admit something I didn't do. I was prepared to stay in forever if necessary to prove my innocence.\\" Shirley's conviction was eventually quashed by the Court of Appeal in 2003, on the basis of exculpatory DNA evidence. The Stephen Downing case involved the conviction and imprisonment in 1974 of a 17-year-old council worker, Stephen Downing, for the murder of a 32-year-old legal secretary, Wendy Sewell. His conviction was overturned in 2002 after Downing had served 27 years in prison. The case is thought to be the longest miscarriage of justice in British legal history,New Statesman ‚Äì The editor, the murder and the truth BBC News 15 January 2002 Downing murder conviction quashedThe new injustices:from false confessions to false allegations and it attracted worldwide media attention. BBC Press Office 2 February 2004 The case was featured in the 2004 BBC drama In Denial of Murder Downing claimed that had he falsely confessed he would have been released over a decade earlier. Because he did not admit to the crime, he was classified as \\"IDOM\\" (In Denial of Murder) and ineligible for parole under English Law. In the United States In the United States the reality of a person being innocent, called \\"actual innocence\\", is not sufficient reason for the justice system to release a prisoner.http://www.democracynow.org/blog/2011/3/30/georgia_and_the_us_supreme_court_tinkering_with_the_machinery_of_death Once a verdict has been made, it is rare for a court to reconsider evidence of innocence that could have been presented at the time of the original trial.http://www.democracynow.org/blog/2009/8/19/troy_davis_and_the_meaning_of_actual_innocence Decisions by the State Board of Pardons and Paroles regarding its treatment of prisoners who may be actually innocent have been criticized by the international community.Goodman, A. (2009, August 19) \\"Troy Davis and the Meaning of 'Actual Innocence'\\". Democracy Now. Retrieved on August 11, 2017 from https://www.democracynow.org/2009/8/19/troy_davis_and_the_meaning_of_actual_innocence Herbert Murray, who was convicted of murder in 1979, said, \\"When the judge asked me did I have anything to say, I couldn't say, because tears were coming down and I couldn‚Äôt communicate. I couldn't turn around and tell the family that they got the wrong man.\\" The judge said he believed the defense's alibi witnesses; however, the judge was required by law to respect the jury's decision. After being locked up for 19 years, his parole officer said \\"Nineteen years is a long time. [....] But you‚Äôre no closer to the rehabilitative process than when you first walked into prison. The first step in that process is the internalization of guilt. You need to do some serious introspection, Mr. Murray, and come to grips with your behavior.\\" Murray agreed with the parole officer but maintained his innocence: \\"I agree! But again, I just didn't do it.\\" In a news interview, Murray says he went before a parole board four times, maintaining his innocence until the fifth time: \\"I said what the hell, let me tell these people what they want to hear.\\" He admitted to the parole board that he committed the crime and was taking responsibility. \\"I felt like I sold my soul to the devil. Because before, I had that strength, because I stood on the truth. [...] I became so desperate to get out, I had to say something. I had to say something because what I said before didn't work.\\" His parole was denied. After 29 years in prison, Medwed's Second Look clinic, a group dedicated to the release of innocent prisoners, assisted lawyers in his eighth parole board hearing which was successful, releasing him onto indefinite parole. However, overturning the original conviction would be hampered by his admissions of guilt at his parole hearings. Timothy Brian Cole (1960‚Äì99) was an African American military veteran and a student wrongly convicted of raping a fellow student in 1985. Cole was convicted by a jury of rape, primarily based on the testimony of the victim, Michele Mallin. He was sentenced to 25 years in prison. While incarcerated, Cole was offered parole if he would admit guilt, but he refused. \\"His greatest wish was to be exonerated and completely vindicated\\", his mother stated in a press interview. Cole died after serving 14 years in prison. Another man, Jerry Wayne Johnson, confessed to the rape in 1995. Further, Mallin later admitted that she was mistaken as to the identity of her attacker. She stated that investigators botched the gathering of evidence and withheld information from her, causing her to believe that Cole was the perpetrator. Mallin told police that the rapist smoked during the rape. However, Cole never smoked because of his severe asthma. DNA evidence later showed him to be innocent. Cole died in prison on December 2, 1999; ten years later, a district court judge announced \\"to a 100 percent moral, factual and legal certainty\\" that Timothy Cole did not commit the rape. He was posthumously pardoned. The dilemma can occur even before conviction. Kalief Browder was arrested in May 2010 for allegedly stealing a backpack. He spent the next three years on Rikers Island awaiting trial, much of it in solitary. During court appearances, prosecutors routinely asked for a short delay which would turn into a much lengthier wait. At times, Browder was offered plea bargains, and at one point, he was encouraged to plead guilty to misdemeanors, for which he would be sentenced to time already served and released. When he refused the plea deal, insisting on his innocence, the judge noted \\"If you go to trial and lose, you could get up to fifteen [years].\\" Eventually, in May 2013, the case was dismissed because prosecutors had lost contact with the only witness they had to the alleged crime. Detriment to society Gabe Tan reported a British conference in 2011, \\"the dilemma of maintaining innocence\\", concluded \\"Denial is not a valid measure of risk. In fact, research has shown that prisoners who openly admit to their crimes have the highest risk of re- offending.\\" In 2011, Michael Naughton suggested the focus on new evidence by the Criminal Cases Review Commission, rather than an examination of serious problems with evidence at original trials, meant in many cases ‚Äúthat the dangerous criminals who committed these crimes remain at liberty with the potential to commit further serious crimes.‚ÄùPotential Wrongful Convictions: Failed by the Criminal Cases Review Commission  INUK Robert A. Forde cited two studies at the conference. One, a ten-year study of 180 sex offenders by Harkins, Beech and Goodwill found prisoners who claimed to be innocent were the least likely to be re-convicted, and that those who 'admitted everything', claiming to be guilty, were most likely to re-offend. He also told the conference research by Hanson et al. in 2002, the denial by the prisoner of their offences had no bearing on their likelihood of re-offending.

Life and career Johnson studied at The Queen's College, Oxford, winning a college scholarship, the Ireland scholarship and the university mathematics scholarship. He matriculated there in 1825, aged 17, graduating B.A. in 1829 with a first-class degree, and M.A. in 1833. He was a Fellow of the college from 1829 to 1855. Johnson was ordained into the Church of England in 1834 and elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1838. He was appointed Savilian Professor of Astronomy in 1839, although his lack of astronomical knowledge led to the separation of the chair from the post of Radcliffe Observer. In 1842, he changed professorships to become White's Professor of Moral Philosophy, a post he held for three years. He advocated reform of Oxford and its colleges, an unpopular stance which he believed scuppered his chances of becoming Provost (head) of his college, although he was appointed as a commissioner under the Oxford University Act 1854. In 1854, Johnson was appointed Dean of Wells, where his time was marred by a dispute about his unpopular decision to hold a parish position in Wells in addition to the deanery to supplement his income. He published Optical Investigations (1835), a book of sermons in 1857 and Science and Natural Religion: a Sermon (which went to two editions).

It is a remake of the 1959 film of the same name which was written and directed by Roger Corman. The film first aired on the Showtime Network during 1995. The film, produced and distributed by Concorde Pictures, was a Roger Corman production. It was part of the Roger Corman Presents series. Plot Janice Starlin is a model who has built up her own cosmetics company. She has always modeled for her own company's advertisements, but now that she is in her forties, investors are advising her to step aside in favor of a younger model. In desperation, she consults a scientist working on a new youth serum based on wasp hormones. Eager for any possible treatment, Janice agrees to be the first human test subject. At first, the results seem miraculous-she looks like a 25-year-old. As time goes on, however, the terrible side effects of the drug become all too apparent.

Travanti as Dr. Eric Zinthorp * Melissa Brasselle as Mary Dennison * Maria Ford as Caitlin * Jay Richardson as John * Gerrit Graham as Arthur Cooper * Richard Gabai as Nick * Johnny Williams as Wasp Collector * Lenny Juliano as Wise Guy Production Jim Wynorski was an admirer of the original 1959 film: \\"Roger shot it on used sets. He's a true genius when it comes to taking something that's just sitting there and making a movie around it. He did a great job.\\" Wynorski said remaking the film was his idea. \\"The original had a very interesting plot, but the film never followed through with the special effects. So I wanted to do it with some bigger crazier effects.\\" Wynorski began his film career working for Roger Corman. He said he wanted to make the film \\"partly out of nostalgia, partly out of respect to a man who really gave me my start. You don't get to make a wacky crazy thing like Wasp Woman all the time. Now if I could remake Attack of the Crab Monsters, it would make my life complete.\\" The film had a 20-day shooting schedule. Wynorski revealed: \\"There's a lot of special effects and things they couldn't do in six days. We have a giant 12-foot-long wasp with wings that fly. It's a wasp with breasts actually. It's quite an astounding thing to see.\\" In an interview with Rubin from Kitley's Krypt, she spoke of the film: \\"I did Wasp Woman because I wanted to go through the Corman studios of course. My best friend, Marta Mobley, was running Corman Studios back then, and she asked me to do it. And I wanted to pass through Corman's place.\\" Asking if Rubin was the person in the Wasp costume during the film, she replied: \\"No, but the wasp was incredible.\\" In the same interview, Rubin spoke of director Jim Wynorski, and what it was like working with him: \\"Despicable. He hated me. He was incredibly mean and rude. Fangoria magazine was there on that set of all places, and interviewed someone who wouldn't give their name and said such mean things about me to that magazine. There were times that it was so loud on the set that I can't even hear myself to think my lines with a page and half of dialogue. It was the worst set I've ever been on in my life. The sound guy, Jeff Enden, was incredible nice to me and was a great friend. But Wynorski, he's a pig. To say I wanted to go through Corman studios, I should have looked at it more carefully. I've never had to experience anybody in my life as disgusting as him.\\" Release The film was initially released on VHS and LaserDisc in 1996 through New Horizons Home Video. The front cover artwork showed the wasp creature. In 1998, it was released on VHS through New Concorde, featuring new artwork, showing a close-up shot of Rubin, with a DVD version being released in 2004. Reception TV Guide awarded the film one out of four stars writing, \\"Tired plotting and terrible special effects make this one of the worst of the Roger Corman-produced, made-for-cable remakes of his 1950s shockers.\\" Richard Jack Smith from ReelTalk.com criticized the film's direction, script, and \\"lame duck special effects\\". Obscurehorror.com gave a favorable review, stating. \\"The remake watched over by previous director Roger Corman, this film does a bit better in comparison to the first film. The effects which were weak in the first movie are much better and frankly, only time and technology could have done that.\\" ReferencesExternal links The Wasp Woman at Letterbox DVD 1995 films 1995 television films 1995 horror films American films American science fiction horror films 1990s science fiction horror films Horror film remakes American television films English-language films 1990s monster movies Mad scientist films Fictional Hymenoptera American monster movies American science fiction television films Horror television films ","title":"The Wasp Woman (1995 film)"},{"id":"35991245","title":"2012 UEFS Futsal Men's Championship"},{"id":"35991248","text":"Nematopogon chalcophyllis is a moth of the family Adelidae or fairy longhorn moths.

It served in North Africa and Italy in the Mediterranean Theater of Operations and France and Germany in the European theater between 1942 and 1945. Originally the I Armored Corps under command of Lieutenant General George S. Patton, it made landfall at Morocco during Operation Torch as the Western Task Force, the first all-U.S. force to enter the European war. Following successful defeat of the Wehrmacht under General Erwin Rommel in North Africa, the I Armored Corps was redesignated the Seventh Army on 10 July 1943 while at sea en route to the Allied invasion of Sicily as the spearhead of Operation Husky. After the conquests of Palermo and Messina the Seventh Army prepared for the invasion of France by its Mediterranean coast as the lead element of Operation Dragoon in August 1944. It then drove a retreating German army north and then west toward the Alsace, being absorbed into the newly created Sixth United States Army Group in mid-September. In January 1945 it repelled a fierce but brief enemy counter-offensive during the German Operation Nordwind, then completed its reduction of the region by mid-March. In a lead role in Operation Undertone launched 15 March, the Seventh Army fought its way across the Rhine into Germany, capturing Nuremberg and then Munich.

History=World War III Armored Corps= The I Armored Corps, the predecessor of Seventh Army, was formed on 15 July 1940 as the command element for armored forces of the United States Army. Its first commander was Major General Adna R. Chaffee, Jr., followed by Major General Charles L. Scott in November 1940. The United States officially entered World War II on 7 December 1941, after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. This was followed four days later by the German declaration of war on the United States. With the goal of stopping German expansion in Europe and Africa, it was decided that the first operation for United States Army forces would be to assist the British in driving German forces from North Africa. On 15 January 1942, Major General George S. Patton Jr. assume command of I Armored Corps and began planning for the invasion of North Africa. On 8 November 1942, General Patton was in command of the Western Task Force (a temporary redesignation of I Armored Corps for tactical deception), the only all-American force landing for Operation Torch, code name for the Allied invasion of French North Africa. I Armored Corps then began to drive east which complemented British forces driving from the west. The result was that Axis forces were trapped in Tunisia and were forced to surrender in May 1943. =Sicily= After succeeding in North Africa, Patton, now promoted to the rank of Lieutenant General, became commander of the newly formed Seventh Army, which was formed at midnight on 10 July 1943 by the redesignation of the I Armored Corps. The Allied invasion of Sicily in July 1943, was conducted in conjunction with the British Eighth Army, commanded by General Sir Bernard Montgomery, Patton's rival. Patton commanded the Seventh Army until early 1944. The Seventh Army landed on several beaches in southern Sicily on 10 July 1943 and captured the Sicilian capital of Palermo on 22 July and, along with the British Eighth Army, captured Messina on 16 August. During the fighting, the elements of the Seventh Army killed or captured thousands of enemy soldiers, mainly Italians. During the operation the Seventh and Eighth Armies came under the command of the 15th Army Group, under General Sir Harold Alexander. The headquarters of the Seventh Army remained relatively inactive at Palermo, Sicily, and Algiers until January 1944, when Lieutenant General Mark W. Clark, then commanding the U.S. Fifth Army on the Italian Front, was assigned as commander and the Seventh Army began planning for the invasion of southern France. The invasion was originally given the code name of \\"Operation Anvil\\", but was changed to \\"Operation Dragoon\\" before the landing. In March 1944, Major General Alexander Patch, a highly experienced and competent commander, was assigned to command the Seventh Army, which moved to Naples, Italy, the following July. On 15 August 1944, elements of the Seventh Army assaulted the beaches of southern France in the St. Tropez and St. Raphael area. (Patch was promoted to Lieutenant General three days later.) On 15 September, the Seventh was put under the field control of the 6th Army Group, under Lieutenant General Jacob L. Devers. The 6th Army Group also included the French First Army. Within one month, the Seventh Army, which by then employed three American divisions, five French divisions and the 1st Airborne Task Force, had advanced 400 miles and joined with the Allied forces coming south from Normandy. In the process, the Seventh Army had liberated Marseilles, Lyon, Toulon and all of Southern France. The Seventh Army then assaulted the German forces in the Vosges Mountains and broke into the Alsatian Plain. During the Battle of the Bulge in late December, it extended its flanks to take over much of the area that had been the responsibility of U.S. Third Army, then commanded by Patton who had previously commanded the Seventh, which allowed the Third to relieve surrounded American forces besieged at Bastogne. In mid-January 1945, the Seventh engaged in pitched battle seeking to regain ground lost to Germany's Operation Nordwind New Year's offensive. Along with the French First Army, the Seventh went on the offensive in February 1945 and eliminated the Colmar Pocket. After capturing the city of Strasbourg, the Seventh went into the Saar, assaulted the Siegfried Line, and reached the River Rhine during the first week of March, 1945. In a lead role in Operation Undertone, the Seventh Army fought its way across the Rhine into Germany, captured Nuremberg and then Munich. Finally it crossed the Brenner Pass and made contact with Lieutenant General Lucian Truscott's U.S. Fifth Army at Vipiteno ‚Äì once again on Italian soil. In less than nine months of continuous fighting, the Seventh Army had advanced over 1,000 miles and for varying times had commanded 24 U.S. and Allied divisions, including the 3rd, 36th, 42nd, 44th, 45th, 63rd, 70th, 100th, and 103rd Infantry Divisions. Cold War The Seventh Army was inactivated in March 1946, in Germany, reactivated for a short time at Atlanta, Georgia, then inactivated again. It was reactivated by the United States European Command (EUCOM) with headquarters at Patch Barracks, Stuttgart-Vaihingen, Germany, on 24 November 1950 and assigned to command the ground and service forces of United States Army Europe (USAREUR).

It is designed to measure the disorder commonly referred to as video game addiction. The creators of the scale and accompanying survey are Dr. Ricardo Tejeiro- Salguero, a researcher at the University of Liverpool, and Dr. Rosa Mar√≠a Bersab√©-Moran, a Psychology professor at the University of M√°laga. __TOC__ Scale The scale‚Äôs survey questions are based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental DisordersDSM-IV, American Psychiatric Association, 1994. (DSM) criteria for substance dependence, and for pathological gambling, as well as the literature on addictions. In presenting their article, published in the British journal Addiction in 2002, Tejeiro- Salguero and Bersab√©-Moran showed, through psychometric analysis, that the PVP Questionnaire is one-dimensional, and has acceptable internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha) of 0.69. The pattern of associations between scale scores and alternative measures of problem play (r=0.64 with frequency of play; r=0.52 with mean duration of play; r=0.56 with longest time per session; r=0.47 with score on the Severity of Dependence Scale; all p < 0.001) supports its construct validity. A study by Hart et al. concluded that, while the PVP is a robust measure of addiction, there is no support for the use of a cutoff score of any level with this instrument. Further, Tejeiro-Salguero suggested that the pattern of problems associated with high PVP scores can be best referred to as abuse, since it is quite similar to the DSM-IV-TR criteria for substance abuse: a maladaptive pattern (of use) leading to clinically significant impairment or distress as manifested by a failure to fulfill major role obligations at school or home, or continued use despite having persistent or recurrent social or interpersonal problems caused or exacerbated by behavior (arguments, physical fights). A 2013 review presented in the Clinical Psychology Review journal by a team of professors from Australia, the Netherlands and the UK found that, among 18 instruments analyzed, the PVP was the only one that demonstrated capacity to assess the proposed DSM-V classification of \\"Internet Use Disorder\\". Four instruments (including the PVP) demonstrated strong convergent validity, and the scores in the scale were positively related to those of the other six instruments reviewed. Also, the PVP and three other instruments demonstrated a single-factor structure with the factor termed \\"addiction\\". The authors concluded that \\"on the basis of available evidence, this review suggests that the Problem Video Game Playing scale may provide the best overall measure of Internet Use Disorder\\".  Research with the PVP  The article presenting the PVP questionnaire was also published in 2003 in the Italian journal Personalita/Dipendenze, edited by the Societa di Studio per i Disturbi di Personalit√° and in the Greek journal Exartiseis. A short article including the questionnaire's nine items was also published in the American newsletter The Complete Practitioner.

It was to be headlined by a UFC Light Heavyweight Championship bout, between champion Jon Jones and former dual-division PRIDE FC and Strikeforce champion Dan Henderson. However, the event was cancelled on August 23, when the UFC announced Henderson was unable to fight due to injury, and Jones refused to take a replacement fight against longtime middleweight contender, Chael Sonnen. Background The fight between Thiago Tavares and Dennis Hallman was originally scheduled to take place at UFC 150, but was moved to this event on July 12, 2012. Josh Koscheck was expected to face Jake Ellenberger, but pulled out of the bout, citing a back injury and was replaced by returning veteran Jay Hieron. Cancellation On August 23, Dana White announced that Henderson had sustained a partial rupture of his MCL and had withdrawn from the fight. White then announced via press conference that UFC 151 would be the first event in the organization's history to be cancelled, after Jones declined to fight Chael Sonnen, who agreed to take the fight on eight days' notice. Initially, White announced that Jones would defend his title against Lyoto Machida at UFC 152 and that UFC 151 simply would not take place. Later, it emerged that Machida declined to fight Jones on such short notice. The UFC announced that former UFC Light Heavyweight Champion Vitor Belfort would challenge Jon Jones at UFC 152. Initial reports indicated that UFC 152, scheduled to take place three weeks later, would be renamed UFC 151. However, Zuffa announced that UFC 152 would keep its name and UFC 151 would officially be deemed a \\"lost show\\". UFC middleweight champion at the time, Anderson Silva reportedly offered to save the event by fighting any light heavyweight other than Jon Jones, and UFC middleweight contender at the time Chris Weidman also inquired about fighting Jones, but both offers arrived too late, after cancellation processes began. Dana White blamed the cancellation on Jones and his coach Greg Jackson, who advised him that accepting the fight with Sonnen on short notice would be the \\"biggest mistake of [his] entire career\\". However, some MMA analysts see the UFC at fault for promoting thin cards. With fights occurring nearly every weekend, the pool of fighters available as substitutes when injuries occur is shallow. CBS Sports columnist Gregg Doyel argued Dana White's mishandling of UFC 151 proved that UFC competitors need a union, stating: \\"...fights fall through all the time ‚Äì the flimsy card fell apart. This was the UFC's fault. This was UFC president Dana White's fault.\\" Dan Henderson was also criticized when it later emerged that he had been injured three weeks prior to the announcement and kept quiet about it as he still hoped to compete.

During the Cold War, it supervised ground formations primarily focused upon the Warsaw Pact to the east as part of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO)'s Central Army Group (CENTAG) . Since 1989, it has greatly reduced its size, dispatched U.S. forces to Southwest Asia, Kosovo, the and increased security cooperation with other NATO land forces. In 2020, the Army announced that U.S. Army Africa will merge with U.S. Army Europe to form a new command, U.S. Army Europe-Africa. History=World War II The European Theater of Operations, United States Army (ETOUSA) was a Theater Army responsible for directing United States Army operations throughout the European Theater of Operations (ETO) from 1942 to 1945. It commanded Army Ground Forces, United States Army Air Forces, and Army Service Forces operations north of Italy and the Mediterranean coast, in the European Theater of World War II. It was bordered to the south by the North African Theater of Operations, US Army (NATOUSA), which later became the Mediterranean Theater of Operations (MTOUSA). The term \\"theater of operations\\" was defined in the US Army field manuals as \\"the land and sea areas to be invaded or defended, including areas necessary for administrative activities incident to the military operations\\". In accordance with the experience of World War I, it was usually conceived of as a large land mass over which continuous operations would take place and was divided into two chief areas-the combat zone, or the area of active fighting, and the Communications Zone, or area required for administration of the theater. As the armies advanced, both these zones and the areas into which they were divided would shift forward to new geographic areas of control. Seventh United States Army was the first U.S. Field Army to see combat during the Second World War and was activated at sea when the I Armored Corps under the command of Lt. General George Patton was redesignated on 10 July 1943. The Seventh Army landed on several beaches in southern Sicily and captured the city of Palermo on 22 July and along with the Eighth British Army captured Messina on 16 August. During the fighting, the elements of the Seventh Army killed or captured over 113,000 enemy soldiers. The Headquarters elements of the Seventh Army remained relatively inactive at Palermo, Sicily, and Algiers, North Africa, until January 1944 when Lt. General Alexander Patch was assigned as commander and the Army began planning for the invasion of southern France. The invasion was originally given the code name of Operation ANVIL but was changed to Operation Dragoon before the landing. In March 1944, Lt. General Alexander Patch was assigned to command the Army which moved to Naples, Italy, the following July. On 15 August 1944, Seventh Army units assaulted the beaches of southern France in the St. Tropez and Saint-Rapha√´l area. Within one month, the Army employing three American Divisions, five French Divisions, and the First Airborne Task Force had advanced 400 miles and had joined with the Normandy forces. In the process, the Seventh Army had liberated Marseilles, Lyon, Toulon, and all of Southern France. Seventh Army then assaulted the German forces in the Vosges Mountains, broke into the Alsatian Plain, and reached the Rhine River after capturing the city of Strasbourg. During the Battle of the Bulge, the Seventh Army extended its flanks to take over much of the Third Army area which allowed the Third to relieve surrounded U.S. forces at Bastogne. Along with the First French Army, the Seventh went on the offensive in February 1945 and eliminated the enemy pocket in the Colmar area. The Seventh then went into the Saar River valley, crossed the Rhine, captured Nuremberg and Munich, crossed the Brenner Pass, and made contact with the Fifth Army ‚Äì once again on Italian soil. In less than nine months of continuous fighting, the Seventh had advanced over 1,000 miles and for varying times had commanded 24 American and Allied Divisions, including the 36th, 42nd, 44th, 45th, 63rd,70th, 103rd, and 105th. When the war ended in Europe on 8 May 1945, the ETOUSA headquarters was located in Versailles, France, just outside Paris. As Eisenhower and his staff began to prepare for the occupation of Germany, the ETOUSA headquarters staff moved to Frankfurt, Germany, and co- located with the Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Forces and the Office of Military Government, United States. ETOUSA was redesignated Headquarters, United States Forces European Theater (HQ USFET) on 1 July 1945, with its headquarters remaining at Frankfurt. At the end of the war, the total U.S. Army strength in Europe was 2.4 million: two Army groups (6th and 12th), five field armies (First, Third, Sixth, Seventh and Ninth), 13 corps headquarters, and 62 combat divisions (43 infantry, 16 armor, and 3 airborne) as well as 11,000 tanks and armored fighting vehicles. Within a year rapid redeployments had brought the occupation forces down to fewer than 290,000 personnel, and many of the larger formations had departed or been inactivated. Seventh Army headquarters remained in control of the western portion of the American zone, and Third Army controlled the eastern portion. In November 1945, the two field army commanders organized district \\"constabularies\\" based on cavalry groups, and on 1 May 1946, the zone-wide U.S. Constabulary headquarters was activated at Bamberg. From then until the early 1950s, the structure of the American occupation forces consisted of the 1st Infantry Division, a separate infantry regiment, and the U.S. Constabulary of 10 cavalry regiments. Seventh Army was inactivated in March 1946, in Germany, reactivated for a short time at Atlanta, Georgia, and assigned to the Regular Army with headquarters at Vaihingen, Germany, in November 1950. Cold War Major Unit Headquarters of 7th US Army, 1957. V & VII Corps USAREUR Garrisons in the 1980s On 15 March 1947, HQ USFET was formally redesignated Headquarters, European Command (HQ EUCOM) (not to be confused with the present joint command, \\"USEUCOM\\", which was formed on 1 August 1952), and between February and June 1948 the headquarters relocated to Campbell Barracks in Heidelberg, where it remained until June 2013. The Army element of the joint European Command headquarters was initially called Headquarters, U.S. Ground and Service Forces, Europe; on 15 November 1947 that designation was changed to Headquarters, United States Army, Europe (USAREUR). On 24 November 1950 EUCOM activated HHC Seventh Army at Stuttgart to take over the command of the ground and service forces from USAREUR, while other USAREUR functions revert to EUCOM. General Eddy became CG of Seventh Army. HQ USAREUR continued to exist, without troops, to fulfilled certain legal requirements in connection with court-martial and other responsibilities. As noted, on 15 November 1947, U.S. Ground and Service Forces, Europe, was renamed Headquarters, United States Army Europe (HQ USAREUR) to accord with the new Department of the Army nomenclature for such commands. USAREUR was a nonoperational organization that provides the ground and service commander with the command functions required for administrative and logistical support. To it were assigned all ground and service units in the command except those assigned to the Office of Military Government, United States; to the Office of the Commander in Chief of European Command; to U.S. Air Forces Europe; to the U.S. Navy, Germany; and to a few exempted War Department agencies. The offices and personnel of the general and special staff divisions of EUCOM headquarters performed USAREUR's general and special staff duties. The principal function of the commanding general of USAREUR became the establishment and maintenance of high standards of discipline. General Huebner also became Commanding General, USAREUR. and \\"The American Military Occupation of Germany 1945 ‚Äì 1953\\" by Oliver J. Frederiksen, Historical Division, United States Army Europe, Darmstadt, 1953, p.32. On 1 August 1952 the previous \\"European Command\\", with headquarters remaining in Heidelberg under the temporary command of General Thomas T. Handy was redesignated Commander-in-Chief, U.S. Army Europe. Also on 1 August 1952, Headquarters, USEUCOM was established in Frankfurt with Gen. Matthew B. Ridgway as commander and Gen. Thomas Handy as deputy commander (Gen. Handy wore two hats for a while). The Berlin Blockade began 24 June 1948 when the Soviet Union blocked the Western Allies' railway and road access to the sectors of Berlin under Allied control. Even though Allied forces in the city were outnumbered 50‚Äì1, General Lucius D. Clay, in charge of the US Occupation Zone in Germany, gave the order for the Berlin Airlift. Headquartered out of Wiesbaden Army Airfield, the Allies supplied almost 9,000 tons per day of supplies to the beleaguered city until the blockade was lifted on 12 May 1949. From 1948 to 1950, the Cold War began to warm, and the outbreak of hostilities in Korea heightened East-West tensions in Europe. Seventh Army was reactivated at Stuttgart in late November 1950. The two U.S. Army division sized units in the U.S. Occupation Zone of Germany, the First Infantry Division and the U.S. Constabulary, were assigned to the Seventh Army. Within a few weeks other assignments to Seventh Army included the V and VII Corps. Due to President Truman's 10 December 1950 Declaration of a National Emergency as a result of circumstances in the Korean War (the war began in June 1950), four CONUS based U.S. Army divisions were alerted to move to the U.S. Occupation Zone of Germany (these divisions were known as the augmentation force to the U.S. Army in Europe). A main concern was possible Soviet attempts to \\"take advantage\\" due to their numerical superiority in Germany during the Korean War. The first augmentation division to arrive overseas in Germany was the 4th Infantry Division in May 1951, followed by the 2nd Armored Division and the 43rd and 28th Infantry Divisions during summer and fall of 1951. A new joint United States European Command (USEUCOM) was established in Frankfurt, Germany on 1 August 1952. On that day, the Army headquarters at Heidelberg, formerly known as EUCOM, became Headquarters, United States Army, Europe. As Cold War tensions continued to escalate in 1952, General Williston B.

About 13,500 soldiers manned each of the USAREUR divisions. New equipment fielded at the time included the M48 tank, the M59 armored personnel carrier, and tactical nuclear weapons. On 15 July 1958 USAREUR forces were ordered to assist the Lebanese government. Task Force 201, the Army component of Operation Blue Bat rapidly deployed more than 8,000 Soldiers from Europe to Beirut by air and sea. As the situation quickly stabilized, all U.S. forces redeployed from the country within 4 months. Although the Korean War ‚Äì open East‚ÄìWest conflict ‚Äì had ended, political tensions remained high in Europe. Particularly troublesome was the impasse over the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany, the former British, French and U.S. zones of occupation) and the German Democratic Republic (East Germany, the former Soviet zone of occupation). East Germany [the DDR] was considered by many countries over the years to be nothing more than the Soviet Zone of Occupation; this changed in 1973 with the UN recognition of both Germanies. Berlin posed an additional problem; it was surrounded by East Germany, but Great Britain, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union all occupied sectors in the city. In the early years, travel between the sectors was unrestricted. At the time Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev announced in June 1961 that the Soviet Union was planning to conclude a peace treaty with the East German government, 3,000 East German refugees flowed daily into Berlin. Suddenly on the night of 12 August 1961, the Soviets closed the border crossing points and began to construct the Berlin Wall, isolating the three western sectors of the city both from East Germany and the Soviet sector, or East Berlin. In response, the United States deployed an additional armored cavalry regiment to Europe, along with additional support units. USAREUR strength reached a post-World War II high of 277,342 in June 1962 as the crisis deepened. That 1946‚Äì1991 Cold War maximum USAREUR troop record gradually reduced over time. The command dispatched a reinforced infantry battle group to Berlin to strengthen the existing garrison. The nuclear armed USAREUR did not go to DEFCON 3 during 22 Oct to 20 November 1962 Cuban Crisis due to political reasons. All other US Forces worldwide were at DEFCON 3 per JFK's 22 October speech and direction to the Pentagon; SAC went to DEFCON 2. The crisis cooled in Berlin from 1962 to 1963, and augmenting forces returned to the United States. Equipment modernization programs during this period included the M113 armored personnel carrier, the M14 rifle, the M60 machine gun, the OV-1 fixed wing observation aircraft, the UH-1B Huey helicopter, the M151 MUTT truck, and the M60 Patton tank. In late 1963 Operation BIG LIFT tested the use of prepositioned equipment through redeployment of the 2nd Armored Division to Europe via a single airlift. On 1 December 1966, the separate Seventh Army headquarters was eliminated, and HQ USAREUR became Headquarters and Headquarters Company, U.S. Army Europe and Seventh Army. At the same time, France withdrew from the military structure of NATO, and U.S. forces were withdrawn from France. The communications zone headquarters moved from Orleans, France, to Worms, Germany, (and later to Kaiserslautern, where as 21st Theater Support Command it remains today). USEUCOM moved to Stuttgart. M-60A3 near Giessen in West Germany, 1985. The first Redeployment of Forces from Germany took place in 1968, with the removal of about 28,000 military personnel from Germany. The units and personnel withdrawn remained committed to NATO and during REFORGER I ‚Äì Return of Forces to Germany ‚Äì conducted in January 1969, more than 12,000 soldiers returned to Germany for an exercise using pre-positioned equipment. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the needs of the war in Vietnam reduced USAREUR's assigned strength, sometimes drastically. As the war began to wane, forces began to return to Europe, and USAREUR adopted a new system based upon the community commander concept. In 1974, efforts to streamline the headquarters resulted in the termination of the U.S. Theater Army Support Command, and its replacement by a smaller organization, the 21st Theater Army Area Command, now known as 21st Theater Sustainment Command (TSC). In the 1970s, USAREUR continued to improve its firepower when it received the new M16A1 rifle, the TOW anti-tank weapon, the OH-58 Kiowa observation helicopter, and the AH-1G Cobra helicopter. During the 1970s, force protection concerns grew as Palestinian groups brazenly conducted terror operations in Europe, such as the kidnapping of Israeli athletes during the 1972 Munich Olympics, and the Red Army Faction and the Red Brigades targeted U.S. facilities and personnel with bombings, kidnapping and assassinations. In May 1972 bombs exploded at V Corps headquarters in Frankfurt, killing an Army lieutenant colonel, and in Heidelberg at Campbell Barracks, killing three Soldiers. U.S. installations were attacked sporadically throughout the remainder of the decade, including a failed 1977 attack on a U.S. Army post in Giessen. On 15 September 1981, an assassination attempt was made on USAREUR commander Gen. Frederick J. Kroesen and his wife as they were driving through Heidelberg‚Äîthe automobile trunk lid deflected the RPG-7 anti-tank projectile. In 1985 Army Specialist Edward Pimental was lured out of a Wiesbaden nightclub and killed for his ID card which was then used to enter Rhein-Main Air Base the next day to plant a bomb that killed two. And in 1986 a bombing at a Berlin disco frequented by service members killed two Soldiers. With increased combat and support components in place, the command undertook a wide-ranging modernization in the decade of the 1980s. More than 400 new systems were introduced, including individual weapons, field rations, the M1A1 Abrams tank, the M2 and M3 Bradley series of infantry and cavalry fighting vehicles, the Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS), the MIM-104 Patriot air defense system, the UH-60 Black Hawk and the AH-64A Apache helicopters. In January 1967, in accordance with Headquarters Department of the Army Msg NR DA796059 dated 9 January 1967, the USAREUR and Seventh Army staffs were merged to become Headquarters and Headquarters Company, United States Army Europe and Seventh Army (HHC USAREUR 7A). Changes of the 1990s The dramatic events of the late 1980s ‚Äì the opening of the Berlin Wall, German reunification, and the collapse of the Soviet Union ‚Äì combined to change USAREUR again. Intermediate nuclear weapons of the 56th Field Artillery Command were withdrawn, chemical weapons were moved out of Europe, and units began to depart the European continent while others were inactivated. When Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990, USAREUR began deploying units to the region. The first deployments from USAREUR to Saudi Arabia in August 1990 included the 45th Medical Company, an element of the 421st Medical Battalion (AA), and advance elements of 12th Aviation Brigade, which by September had deployed two Apache attack helicopter battalions, an OH-58 Kiowa scout helicopter company, a Black Hawk utility helicopter company, a CH-47 Chinook platoon, and associated support and maintenance units. These were quickly followed by intelligence specialists, chemical warfare experts, logistical personnel, many individual replacements, and finally almost the entire VII Corps. The command eventually deployed more than 75,000 personnel plus 1,200 tanks, 1,700 armored combat vehicles, more than 650 pieces of artillery, and more than 325 aircraft. When the war ended, many USAREUR soldiers remained to complete the logistical cleanup; others were deployed to northern Iraq or Turkey as part of Operation Provide Comfort to aid refugees. Upon their return to Europe, many also found that their units were in the process of either relocating to the Continental United States (CONUS) or inactivating. In 1992 alone, about 70,000 soldiers redeployed to CONUS with about 90,000 family members. The command shrank from 213,000 soldiers in 1990 to 122,000 in 1992. VII Corps was inactivated. From 858 installations in 1990, USAREUR went down to only 415 in 1993 with more scheduled to close in the years ahead. After the Gulf War and the subsequent drawdowns, USAREUR faced a wholly different challenge in Europe. The command was engaged in humanitarian support operations, to include disaster relief and rescue and recovery, peacekeeping and non-combatant evacuations. Between 1990 and 1993 the command supported 42 deployments, which involved a total of 95,579 personnel. Conflict in the Balkans quickly became one of the United States Department of Defense's primary areas of focus, and peace enforcement in Bosnia was a harbinger of future military operations. From 1990 to 1995 USAREUR conducted mostly humanitarian operations in the area. In October 1992, USAREUR sent the 212th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital (MASH) and personnel from the 7th Medical Command to Zagreb, Croatia to provide medical support for United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) casualties. Throughout 1993‚Äì1995, USAREUR's 5th Quartermaster Company, in conjunction with United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE), delivered humanitarian aid to the region. In June 1993, the command formed Task Force Able Sentry in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia with the headquarters at Camp Able Sentry near the capital Skopje. These forces, along with personnel from 26 other countries, were originally part of the UNPROFOR which in 1995 became the U.N. Preventative Deployment force (UNPREDEP) deterring the spread of armed conflict. Upon expiration of the initial UN mandate in February 1999, USAREUR renamed the U.S. Army organization Task Force Sabre, with the task to protect U.S. facilities and equipment. They were relieved in June 1999 by the U. S. national support element to Kosovo Force (KFOR)-Task Force Falcon (Rear). U.S. Soldiers left Camp Able Sentry in 2002, but it remained as a contractor operated logistics base until Aug. 2004 when all U.S. personnel departed and NATO assumed control of the camp. In Bosnia-Herzegovina, after the Dayton Peace Accords were reached in Nov. 1995, USAREUR's 1st Armored Division began deploying there in December, with the first C-130 landing in Tuzla, Bosnia, 2 Dec, and the first trains departing Germany 8 December. One major barrier to the deployment of the 1st Armored Division was the bridge over the Sava River, which was destroyed during the four-year civil war. Construction of the longest assault float bridge in military history, 620 meters long, ribbon float (pontoon) bridge between Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina began on 22 December. Despite melting snow that flooded the river and later, freezing temperatures, the bridge was completed on 31 December and the first M1A1 Abrams tank crossed the bridge at 10 am. The division, along with many Reserve Component support troops, formed Task Force Eagle as part of the NATO-led Implementation Force (IFOR) (also known as Operation Joint Endeavor) with the mission to implement and monitor the military aspects of the agreement, enforce the cease-fire, supervise the marking of boundaries and the zone of separation between the former warring factions, and enforce the withdrawal of the combatants to their barracks and the movement of heavy weapons to storage sites. It was the first time a NATO sponsored force had deployed operationally outside the NATO boundaries. IFOR was succeeded in Dec. 1996 by a smaller, NATO-led Stabilisation Force (SFOR) (Operation Joint Guard) whose mission was to deter renewed hostilities. On 20 June 1998 the mission was renamed Operation Joint Forge, and USAREUR continued to serve as the Army Service Component Command (ASCC) providing oversight for the mission. On 24 November 2004, Task Force Eagle officially disestablished and closed its base in Tuzla, with European Union forces assuming responsibility for the Bosnia mission. In early 1999, in response to growing ethnic tensions in Kosovo and military and paramilitary forces in daily conflict resulting in the more than 1,500 Kosovar Albanian deaths and 400,000 refugees, USAREUR formed Task Force Falcon, with the 1st Infantry Division as the core element. On 9 June 1999, after an inconclusive air campaign, Task Force Falcon deployed forces in the largest combined air- rail-sea-road movement since Operation Desert Storm, entering Kosovo on 12 June 1999, as part of Operation Joint Guardian, a NATO-led peacekeeping force with a UN mandate to separate warring factions, oversee the withdrawal of Serb forces and interdict the flow of arms to insurgents. On 17 February 2008, the Kosovo Assembly declared Kosovo independent. Currently, the U.S. Army, with approx. 800 Soldiers, has the lead for Multinational Battle Group East (MNBG-E) in the eastern region, headquartered near Uro≈°evac at Camp Bondsteel as part of KFOR. Contributing nations include Greece, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, and Ukraine. The majority of U.S. Soldiers come from U.S. Army National Guard units, with a different state taking over the lead for each rotation of approximately nine months. War on Terror The 11 September 2001 attacks did not directly affect the Seventh Army. However, the campaign in Iraq in 2003 did. The headquarters of V Corps was deployed to Iraq, as did 173rd Airborne Brigade, and after the campaign, 1st Armored Division followed for occupation duties. With parts of 1st Infantry Division also deployed in Iraq, and others on peacekeeping duties in the Balkans, Seventh Army was virtually stripped of combat formations. The return of 173rd Brigade, V Corps and 1st Armored Division in early 2004 was followed by the deployment of the rest of 1st Infantry Division for occupation duties. V Corps began a rotational deployment in 2009 in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. The U.S. Army's reorganization plans from 2005 called for the formation's major subordinate units ‚Äì 1st Armored Division and 1st Infantry Division ‚Äì to be relocated to the continental United States ‚Äì Fort Bliss, Texas, and Fort Riley, Kansas, respectively. The 2nd Stryker Cavalry Regiment, converted to a Stryker Brigade, and the 12th Aviation Brigade, replaced them. Seventh Army, having been merged with US Army Europe since 1967, remained merged, as was confirmed with the release of unit designations for the modular force in mid 1996. HQ USAREUR and V Corps were slated to merge and the process started until the decision was made to retain a Corps Headquarters within USAREUR, and V Corps was once again separated from HQ USAREUR. Since that time it was decided that V Corps would deactivate after a final deployment to Afghanistan which is ongoing. In September 2005, it was expected that the finalised force in Europe would consist of USAREUR HQ, V Corps, aviation and combat service support, and two maneuver brigades: the 2nd Cavalry Regiment in Vilseck, Germany, the 173rd Airborne Brigade, which will eventually expand to three airborne battalions, in Italy.See Michael Knights, 'US regional commands diversify across the 'arc of instability,' Jane's Intelligence Review, September 2005, 23 Joint Task Force East provided from forces rotating from continental United States though bases in Bulgaria and Romania, was initially intended to be provided by a rotating US-based brigade. Two bases at Constan»õa, Romania were developed, apparently with the main facility at Mihail KogƒÉlniceanu Airfield. Initially however, Joint Task Force East was to have been provided by a rotational 2nd Cavalry Regiment Stryker squadron. The Task Force was originally planned to be called the Eastern Europe Task Force. However, since the stresses of the Iraq and Afghan deployments, the army provision of Joint Task Force East has been replaced by a Marine force known as the Black Sea Rotational Force. From 2008 to 2012‚Äì13, the two to three brigades listed above were augmented by the 170th Infantry Brigade and the 172nd Infantry Brigade, 'reflagged' former V Corps/1st Armored Division formations.*Mark St.Clair, and John Vandiver, Name changes set for 2 Germany- based units, Stars and Stripes, Friday, 7 March 2008 Thus from 2008 to 2013, the force will consist of two heavy brigades combat teams, the 2nd Stryker Cavalry Regiment, and the 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team. Nearly forty years later, Army Campaign Plan DP 58 (circa 2006) effectively dropped the Seventh Army title. Decisions that took effect in 2006 stated that the official designation would be Headquarters and Headquarters Battalion, United States Army Europe.http://armypubs.army.mil/epubs/pdf/go0618.pdfhttp://www.tradoc.army.mil/g357/cp32/forms/DP_58_EXSUM.pdf The organization perpetuates the lineage and honors of the Seventh Army and authorized the display and wear of appropriate Seventh Army heraldic items. On 25 October 2009, in a ceremony at the Parade Field on Daenner Kaserne, the 7th US Army Reserve Command, United States Army Reserve, was inactivated and redesignated the 7th Civil Support Command (CSC). In September 2015 the 7th CSC became the 7th Mission Support Command. On 26 January 2012, Chief of Staff of the United States Army General Raymond Odierno announced that two Army heavy infantry brigades would be withdrawn from Europe and inactivated. As the 170th Brigade was one of only two such heavy infantry brigades in Europe at the time, it was believed that it was one of the units slated to be inactivated in the wake of large cuts in the U.S. defense budget The 170th Infantry Brigade at Baumholder was deactivated on 9 October 2012. In 2013, further reductions of U.S. forces in Europe were announced, that would reduce U.S. Army Europe to 30,000 soldiers in two brigade combat teams. These reductions include unit deactivations and facilities closures at Warner Barracks, Bamberg and Schweinfurt. Military police units were reduced: 202nd MP Group and the 1002nd MP Battalion were disbanded on 24 June 2013. In February 2013, it was announced that V Corps would be inactivated in June 2013.http://www.defense.gov/news/20120216EURPosture.pdf In a ceremony on 12 June 2013, V Corps was awarded the Army Superior Unit Award and Meritorious Unit Citation and formally inactivated. In April 2013, the last of U.S. Army's main battle tanks left Europe due to the departure of the U.S. Army's last two Germany-based heavy brigades: the 170th out of Baumholder and the 172nd at Grafenw√∂hr.Stars and Stripes: \\"US Army's last tanks depart from Germany\\" By John Vandiver 4 April 2013 \\"There is no [U.S.] tank on German soil.

The handclip design provides leverage, helping to prevent toppling. The Safetray, invented in 2009, is now sold worldwide by Edinburgh-based Safetray Products Ltd. History Waiter using only friction to retain a waitperson service tray in Vienna, Austria Wait staff trays are typically large circular disks used to serve drinks and/or food to people in restaurants, bars, and other hospitality industry businesses. The waiter or waitress carries the tray with the open palm of one hand placed underneath, in about the center of the tray, relying on dry friction between the hand and the smooth metal or plastic undersurface of the tray to retain control of the tray. Occasionally, the tray may slide from the waitperson's hand, and the contents crash to the floor. In a May 2012 survey of food industry servers, those responding revealed nearly 25 percent of staff that work or have worked in the hospitality industry have suffered an injury as a result of a toppled serving tray. Of those people questioned, 23 percent had burned or cut themselves while trying to serve drinks or food from a serving tray. Different devices have been developed in an effort to assist waitstaff in stabilising the service trays. Inventors have tried techniques such as attaching finger knobs/hubs (1998)NL application 1010697C2, Willem De Jong, \\"Serving tray with central hub on underside to allow gripping with fingers\\", published 2000-04-10 and removable hand posts (2010) that protrude from the underside of the tray. They also tried the use of finger insertion holes in the tray to stabilize the tray. To restrain the hand to the underside of the tray, inventors have looked into devices such as a hand panel allowing insertion of two fingers of a hand (1985), a separately-fingered digit forward-retention device (1999), and a stretchable strap that forms a loop into which the user's fingers are inserted (2003). Design and development The Safetray brand serving tray product attaches a wait staff tray to the hand using a concept similar to how flip-flops attach to the foot. In December 2009 Alison Grieve, a 32-year-old waitress and event manager from Bruntsfield, Edinburgh, witnessed a waitress drop a tray full of glasses of champagne at a corporate event for a delegation of international lawyers. To address how a tray could right itself at the moment of impending tilt, Grieve, a first-time inventor with a university background in 'History of film and photography', developed a finger receiver attached to the bottom of a wait tray based on first-principle physics, load dispersal, and counter movement. In a closed position, the finger receiver lays flush with the bottom of the wait tray so that the tray can sit on the surface of a bar or table without wobbling and can be stacked onto other trays. When the device is open, two slots can be accessed into which a waitperson may secure their two inside fingers, similar to how a flip-flop structurally attaches itself between the toes of the foot to counter the large stresses place upon it. The Safetray product's arrangement creates a strong cantilever advantage for the waitperson to allow them additional control over torque caused by items placed in various locations around the tray. The stability achieved with the Safetray product allows a waitperson to place a bottle of wine right at the edge of the tray while still keeping the tray in a horizontal position by reacting instinctively against the bottle's off-balance downward force. Intellectual property and publicity Grieve filed for a Great Britain patent in March 2010 and began seeking investors. By April she had formed Safetray Products Limited, which sought to register the intellectual property \\"safetray, safetray,\\" as a trademark in the United Kingdom, and sent 2,500 Safetray devices throughout a Scotland hospitality chain as part of a testing process. In August 2010, seeking to secure financing from a panel of venture capitalists, Grieve appeared with the Safetray device on a Dragons' Den-style \\"Brand of the Future\\" competition at the Edinburgh International Marketing Festival. Bill Jamieson, writer for The Scotsman and a judge at the competition, noted that the product was a step towards making drink service trays in hotels and bars spill-proof. The Safetray device lost the competition to a company that turns discarded plastic into chairs, lighting, and other eco-focused products. A month later, Safetray Products Ltd uploaded the first of several Safetray promotional videos to YouTube. In 2011, Safetray Products Ltd won the Marketing 4 Start-Up Britain award at a competition run by the Marketing Agencies Association and the Government-backed StartUp Britain initiative and the company received creative ideas and marketing advice free of charge for a year from Iris Worldwide. Sales Inventor Alison Grieve holds a Safetray By June 2011, the Safetray device was being manufactured in China to meet orders that had been placed by customers throughout Europe and across America. In December 2011, after the Safetray product had been exhibited at trade shows in Las Vegas and Chicago, Safetray Products Ltd had sold 3,000 units worldwide for around GBP16 each (about USD $25) and was awarded contracts to supply the device to the Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts, Sodexo, and Compass Group. Grieve, on behalf of Safetray Products Ltd, received GBP200,000 (USD $310,000) from an investor syndicate composed of investment group Equity Gap and individual investors. She used the money to strengthen the worldwide patent protection of the product, expand its markets to United Arab Emirates and United States hotels, and shift mass production of the now eco-friendly Safetray product from China to the McLaren Plastics factory in Loanhead, a small town in Midlothian, Scotland, creating four new permanent jobs in that municipality. The company was valued at ¬£1 million ($1.5 million US dollars) at the end of 2011. In February 2012, Safetray Products Ltd exhibited the product in the Scottish Development International pavilion at the Dubai, UAE Gulfood Exhibition 2012, a large annual food and hospitality show. In April the company hired the law firm of Baker Hostetler of Washington, DC, to seek trademark protection in the United States for the mark \\"SAFETRAY,\\" with a design of a bottle and glass supported at a distance from and above the letter T in the Safetray name. In June First Minister of Scotland Alex Salmond honored Grieve's Safetray innovation and business success at the 2012 Business in the Parliament Conference.

It was primarily used for the internment of Slovene Home Guard prisoners of war, Germans and Slovene civilians. The camp was built in 1943 by German forces and was used as a military camp for Hitler Youth. It had six residential barracks and ten other buildings. The camp was abandoned for a short time after the war, but was reactivated by the Yugoslav communists at the end of May 1945 to accommodate former members of the Slovene Home Guard and others that had collaborated with the Germans, as well as civilians that had fled before the advancing Yugoslav People's Army to Allied camps in Austrian Carinthia. On 31 May 1945 the entire 2nd Assault Battalion headed by Vuk Rupnik was brought to Teharje, and in the first days of June 1945 approximately 3,000 members of the Slovene Home Guard joined them. It is estimated that the postwar authorities executed approximately 5,000 internees of Teharje without trial during the first month or two after the Second World War. A memorial park designed by Slovenian architect Marko Mu≈°iƒç was built on the site of the camp in 2004. Background Axis POWs at the town of Celje in May 1945 After the occupation of Yugoslavia in April 1941, the area of Slovenia was divided into three parts between Germany, Italy and Hungary. On 27 April 1941, Liberation Front (Osvobodilna fronta) was established in Ljubljana as the main anti-fascist organization. The armed resistance started after the German invasion of the Soviet Union in July 1941. The Italian authorities sponsored local anti-communist units that served as auxiliary troops in fighting the Slovene Partisans. Following the capitulation of Italy in September 1943, Germany took over the Italian provinces in Slovenia and united the Slovene anti-communist units into the Slovene Home Guard. At the end of the war, Croatian and German forces began retreating to the Austrian border through Slovenia. Slovene forces also began retreating and on 12 May 1945, around 30,000 soldiers, including 10,000 to 12,000 Slovenes, 10,000 Germans, 4,000 Serbs, 4,000 members of the Russian Corps, and 6,000 Slovene civilians, surrendered to the British forces on the Austrian border. Establishment The camp was built by the Germans near the town of Teharje in the summer of 1943 to accommodate members of the Hitler Youth (Hitlerjugend). It had six large barracks and four courtyards where members of the organization trained shooting, learned geography and played sports. The OZNA (Department of National Security) took over the camp in May 1945 and turned it into a prison camp for internees in the Celje area. A report from the OZNA on 16 May stated \\"in addition to the prison, we established a concentration camp at Teharje\\". Additional 16 building were erected, including a warehouse and a bunker under it, used as a torture chamber. In total there were 17 large barracks, six in the central part of the camp and the rest on the surrounding slopes. Every barrack and courtyard was separately fenced with wire. The whole complex, about 500 meters wide and 800 meters long, was surrounded with barbed wire fences. Outside of the fence were spotlights and five guard posts of machine gun bunkers or watch towers. The commander of the camp was Tone Turnher. Arrival of prisoners The People's Defence Corps of Yugoslavia (KNOJ) organized the transports of prisoners to Teharje. First of them were detainees from the Stari Pisker prison in Celje. A report from 16 May 1945 mentions that there were 1.088 internees in the Teharje camp, most of whom were captured in raids carried out by the KNOJ in Celje. Slovene prisoners were separated from others that were turned over to the 3rd Army or military authorities of their countries. The OZNA conducted mass arrests of Germans from the Koƒçevje region (Gottscheers) that were also brought to Teharje. On 29 May, Marko Selin, Chief of the Celje OZNA, reported that a total of 252 prisoners were executed in the Celje district during May 1945. The Slovene Home Guards that surrendered to the British forces in May 1945 were interned in the Vetrinje (Viktring) camp near Klagenfurt, Austria. From 27 May to 31 May they were brought by trains to Bleiburg and repatriated to Yugoslavia, in total around 9,500 Home Guards and 600 civilians. Several thousand of them were taken by trains from the Austrian border at Dravograd towards the town of Celje. On 28 May, around 2,800 members of the 4th Home Guard Regiment and 200 civilians were transported from Bleiburg to Slovenj Gradec. The 3rd Home Guard regiment arrived in Slovenj Gradec on 29 May and were together with the first group sent by trains to nearby Velenje and from there to Celje, where they arrived on the morning of 1 July. Some of the prisoners managed to escape during the trip. On 30 May the 2nd Home Guard Regiment traveled from Bleiburg, across Maribor, and arrived in Celje on 31 May. From the railway station of Celje they were taken by the OZNA and KNOJ through the town by foot towards the nearby Teharje camp, 7 kilometers east of Celje. During the whole trip prisoners were beaten and those that lagged behind were shot. Upon arrival to the camp they had to drop everything they had and were left only with their clothes. The Home Guards received no food on the first day. The camp was not suitable for the admission of prisoners from Bleiburg, but was chosen because it already had barracks and was near the town of Celje. In total around 4,000 to 5,000 Slovene Home Guards and civilians were transferred from Bleiburg to Teharje. Treatment of inmates The Home Guards were placed in the courtyards, while civilians and Germans were placed in barracks. The barracks were 20 meters in length and 8 meters in width and had bunk beds, toilets and sinks. Windows had iron bars. Around the barracks was a narrow ditch that the Home Guards were forbidden to cross. A list was made of every prisoner with their personal information and date of entry in the army. The lists were used to separate Home Guard POWs into three groups: group A consisted of juveniles, group B consisted of those mobilized in 1945, and group C included the rest. However, there were exceptions of this rule. Minors from group A were situated in a barrack and were told that they will be tried by People's Courts. The B group were also in a separate barrack, but a part of them were selected for execution. The majority of Home Guards were in group C and were placed on the open. The first two groups received two meals a day. The third group had the harshest treatment at the camp and were given no water and food for the first two and a half days. Later they received one meal daily and from 5 June two meals daily. They were sometimes allowed to bring water and share it with inmates, which depended on the guards. Interned civilians in the camp were those accused of collaboration that were arrested in and around Celje, mostly Germans and Slovenes, and civilians that arrived with the Home Guard from Bleiburg, mostly family members. They had free access to water and had better food, but also suffered ill-treatment. At times, the OZNA guards would take female prisoners to the main barracks during the night where they were raped. Several witnesses reported that around 15 infants died on a wagon due to sun exposure. Home Guard Officers were subjected to torture in the camp's bunker. One day a group of officers were blindfolded and brought outside the barrack. Among them was first lieutenant Anton Kavƒçiƒç, whose wife Marija, daughter and two sons were among interned civilians. His daughter recognized him and started screaming, so the guards forced her to get back in the inmate barrack. His wife was then taken to the OZNA barrack where she was raped and killed. Three underage Home Guards were killed after they were caught taking canned food from backpacks that were confiscated from them upon arrival. Massacres A large number of prisoners from Teharje were executed in the Barbara Pit massacre All prisoners from groups C and the majority from group B were taken to nearby pits, ditches or caves and executed there. The transfers of prisoners were mostly done at night. After hearing his name, the called out prisoner would step out and his hands were tied with telephone strings behind his back in pair with another prisoner, after which they would climb into the truck. The prisoners were told that they were being transported to another camp. Among the first victims were members of the White Guard. One night they were called out, loaded onto trucks and busses and taken to the nearby valley where they were shot. Bursts of gunfire from the valley lasted for an hour. Home Guard officers were killed at Stari Hrastnik. Several officers managed to escape during the trip. The transport of others began on 5 June with the 2nd Home Guard Regiment. The OZNA engaged drivers from across the country to carry out the transports. The drivers were not informed about the details of the action. The locations were mostly nearby pit caves. Once they arrived, the prisoners were taken off tracks, ordered to take their clothes off, lined up along the edge of the pit and shot. Some of them survived the initial round and the fall into the cave, so their screams were heard for hours. In some cases the soldiers threw in hand grenades to finish those that were still alive. Most of Home Guards from group C were killed by mid June. After their liquidation, the second wave of purges began, this time of Home Guards from group B. They were encouraged by a dispatch from Deputy Prime Minister of Yugoslavia Edvard Kardelj to Slovenian Prime Minister Boris Kidriƒç on 25 June that stated: By the end of June, mostly prisoners younger than 18 remained in the camp. A new selection was made and around 100 Home Guards were taken with trucks to the surroundings of Celje and killed there. On 21 June, 11 prisoners tried to escape from the camp. They cut through the first fence, managed to pass the guard and jumped over the second fence. Seven were caught and four managed to run away. The largest mass grave of prisoners from Teharje is an abandoned coal mine in Huda Jama, where Home Guards were killed in the Barbara Pit massacre. Other mass grave locations include Hrastnik, Peƒçovnik, Marija Reka, Zgornja Hudinja, Prapretno and Be≈æigrad. Amnesty and camp dissolution The first prisoners that were released from the camp were civilians at the beginning of July. Before they left, they were photographed and their fingerprints were taken. Between 19 and 24 July, a court-martial tried the remaining Home Guards. All of them were sentenced to penal labour, mostly for the duration of several months to one year. The AVNOJ presidency passed a decree on general amnesty and pardon on 3 August. 371 Home Guards were released during August in accordance with the amnesty. The camp was turned into a penal camp and renamed Institute for forced labor Teharje. It existed until October 1946 when most of the remaining prisoners were transferred to Maribor. Yugoslav camps for forced labour formally existed until January 1946, when they were renamed \\"institutions for forced labour\\", but continued to operate the same way. Around 7,000 to 8,000 people passed through the Teharje camp. Out of 5,000 Slovene Home Guards, only several hundred were still in the camp when the general amnesty was given in August 1945. After the camp's closure, the barracks were removed. In 1974 the area of the former camp was turned into a waste depot for the chemical processing factory in Celje. A golf course was built on a part of the site. Memorial park The Teharje Memorial Park was built in 2004 In 1993, the Slovenian government approved the plan to build a memorial park at the Teharje site, designed by Slovenian architect Marko Mu≈°iƒç. The memorial park, described as a \\"central symbolic monument of the Republic of Slovenia, dedicated to the memory of the victims of post-war killings in the territory of the country\\", was officially opened on 10 October 2004. It is the largest memorial in Slovenia. An annual ceremony in remembrance of the victims of post-World War II killings is held at the memorial site. In 2014, the park was recognised by the Slovenian government as a cultural monument of national significance.

The mosque is located west of Lahore Fort along the outskirts of the Walled City of Lahore, and is widely considered to be one of Lahore's most iconic landmarks. The Badshahi Mosque was built by Emperor Aurangzeb in 1671, with construction of the mosque lasting for two years until 1673. The mosque is an important example of Mughal architecture, with an exterior that is decorated with carved red sandstone with marble inlay. It remains the largest mosque of the Mughal-era, and is the second-largest mosque in Pakistan. After the fall of the Mughal Empire, the mosque was used as a garrison by the Sikh Empire and the British Empire, and is now one of Pakistan's most iconic sights.  Location  Badshahi Mosque stands across the Hazuri Bagh from Lahore Fort. Badshahi Mosque is renowned for the carved marble and elaborate plasterwork that are used throughout the mosque's interior. The mosque is located adjacent to the Walled City of Lahore, Pakistan. The entrance to the mosque lies on the western side of the rectangular Hazuri Bagh, and faces the famous Alamgiri Gate of the Lahore Fort, which is located on the eastern side of the Hazuri Bagh. The mosque is also located next to the Roshnai Gate, one of the original thirteen gates of Lahore, which is located to the southern side of the Hazuri Bagh.Waheed ud Din, p.14 Near the entrance of the mosque lies the Tomb of Muhammad Iqbal, a poet widely revered in Pakistan as the founder of the Pakistan Movement which led to the creation of Pakistan as a homeland for the Muslims of British India.Waheed Ud Din, p.15 Also located near the mosque's entrance is the tomb of Sir Sikandar Hayat Khan, who is credited for playing a major role in preservation and restoration of the mosque.IH Malik Sikandar Hayat Khan: A Biography Islamabad: NIHCR, 1984. p 127 Background Entrance to the main prayer hall is through arches made of red sandstone city was made an imperial capital by the earlier Emperor, Akbar, who established the nearby Lahore Fort. The sixth Mughal emperor, Aurangzeb, chose Lahore as the site for his new imperial mosque. Aurangzeb, unlike the previous emperors, was not a major patron of art and architecture and instead focused, during much of his reign, on various military conquests which added over 3 million square kilometres to the Mughal realm. The mosque was built to commemorate Aurangzeb's military campaigns in southern India, in particular against the Maratha king Shivaji. As a symbol of the mosque's importance, it was built directly across from the Lahore Fort and its Alamgiri Gate, which was concurrently built by Aurangzeb during construction of the mosque. History=Construction The Badshahi Mosque features a monumental gateway that faces the Hazuri Bagh quadrangle and Lahore Fort. The mosque was commissioned by the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb in 1671, with construction overseen by the Emperor's foster brother, and Governor of Lahore, Muzaffar Hussein - also known by the name Fidai Khan Koka.Meri, p.91 Aurangzeb had the mosque built in order to commemorate his military campaigns against the Maratha king Chhatrapati Shivaji. After only two years of construction, the mosque was opened in 1673. Sikh era The Samadhi of Ranjit Singh (white edifice) is a Sikh shrine that was built next to the mosque in 1848. On 7 July 1799, the Sikh army of Ranjit Singh took control of Lahore. After the capture of the city, Maharaja Ranjit Singh used its vast courtyard as a stable for his army horses, and its 80 Hujras (small study rooms surrounding the courtyard) as quarters for his soldiers and as magazines for military stores. In 1818, he built a marble edifice in the Hazuri Bagh facing the mosque, known as the Hazuri Bagh Baradari,Tikekar, p. 74 which he used as his official royal court of audience. Marble slabs for the baradari may have been plundered by the Sikhs from other monuments in Lahore. During the First Anglo-Sikh War in 1841, Ranjit Singh's son, Sher Singh, used the mosque's large minarets for placement of zamburahs or light guns which were used to bombard the supporters of Chand Kaur, who had taken refuge in the besieged Lahore Fort. In one of these bombardments, the fort's Diwan-e-Aam (Hall of Public Audience) was destroyed, but was subsequently rebuilt in the British era. During this time, Henri de La Rouche, a French cavalry officer employed in the army of Sher Singh, also used a tunnel connecting the Badshahi mosque to the Lahore fort to temporarily store gunpowder. In 1848, the Samadhi of Ranjit Singh was built for the Sikh ruler Ranjit Singh at a site immediately adjacent to the mosque after his death. British Rule Badshahi Mosque had fallen into disrepair after the city's Sikh rule In 1849 the British seized control of Lahore from the Sikh Empire. During the British Raj, the mosque and the adjoining fort continued to be used as a military garrison. The 80 cells built into the walls surrounding its vast courtyard were demolished by the British after the Indian Rebellion of 1857, so as to prevent them from being used for anti-British activities. The cells were replaced by open arcades known as dalans.Development of mosque Architecture in Pakistan by Ahmad Nabi Khan, p.114 Because of increasing Muslim resentment against the use of the mosque as a military garrison, the British set up the Badshahi Mosque Authority in 1852 to oversee the restoration and to re-establish it as a place of religious worship. From then onwards, piecemeal repairs were carried out under the supervision of the Badshahi Mosque Authority. The building was officially handed back to the Muslim community by John Lawrence, who was the Viceroy of India. The building was then re-established as a mosque. In April 1919, after the Amritsar Massacre, a mixed Sikh, Hindu and Muslim crowd of an estimated 25,000-35,000 gathered in the mosque's courtyard in protest. A speech by Gandhi was read at the event by Khalifa Shuja-ud-Din, who would later become Speaker of the Provincial Assembly of the Punjab.Note: Reports on the Punjab Disturbances April 1919 gives a figure of 25,000 Extensive repairs commenced from 1939 onwards, when Sikandar Hayat Khan began raising funds for this purpose.Omer Tarin, Sir Sikandar Hyat Khan and the Renovation of the Badshahi Mosque, Lahore: An Historical Survey, in Pakistan Historical Digest Vol 2, No 4, Lahore, 1995, pp. 21-29 Renovation was supervised by the architect Nawab Alam Yar Jung Bahadur. As Khan was largely credited for extensive restorations to the mosque, he was buried adjacent to the mosque in the Hazuri Bagh.  Post- independence  The mosque is heavily used during the Islamic month of Ramadan. Restoration works begun in 1939 continued after the Independence of Pakistan, and were completed in 1960 at a total cost of 4.8 million Rupees. On the occasion of the 2nd Islamic Summit held at Lahore on 22 February 1974, thirty-nine heads of Muslim states offered their Friday prayers in the Badshahi Mosque, including, among others, Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto of Pakistan, Faisal of Saudi Arabia, Muammar Gaddafi, Yasser Arafat, and Sabah III Al-Salim Al-Sabah of Kuwait. The prayers were led by MawlƒÅnƒÅ Abdul Qadir Azad, the then khatib of the mosque.\\"Report on Islamic Summit, 1974 Pakistan, Lahore, February 22‚Äì24, 1974\\", Islamabad: Department of Films and Publications, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Auqaf and Haj, Government of Pakistan, 1974 (p. 332) In 1993, the Badshahi Mosque in a tentative list as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. In 2000, the marble inlay in the main prayer hall was repaired. In 2008, replacement work on the red sandstone tiles on the mosque's large courtyard was begun using red sandstone imported from the original Mughal source near Jaipur, in the Indian state of Rajasthan. Architecture The mosque's interior is embellished with Mughal frescoes and carved marble. The mosque's domes As a gateway to the west, and Persia in particular, Lahore had a strong regional style which was heavily influenced by Persian architectural styles. Earlier mosques, such as the Wazir Khan Mosque, were adorned in intricate kashi kari, or Kashan style tile work, from which the Badshahi Mosque would depart. Aurangzeb chose an architectural plan similar to that of Shah Jehan's choice for the Jama Masjid in Delhi, though built the Badshahi mosque on a much larger scale.Akhter, p.270 Both mosques feature red sandstone with white marble inlay, which is a departure from typical mosque design in Lahore, in which decoration is done by means of intricate tile work. Entryway of the complex The intricately painted entryway Entrance to the mosque complex is via a two-storey edifice built of red sandstone which is elaborately decorated with framed and carved paneling on each of its facades. The edifice features a muqarna, an architectural feature from the Middle East that was first introduced into Mughal architecture with construction of the nearby and ornate Wazir Khan Mosque. The mosque's full name \\"Masjid Abul Zafar Muhy-ud-Din Mohammad Alamgir Badshah Ghazi\\" is written in inlaid marble above the vaulted entrance.Meri, p.92 The mosque's gateway faces east towards the Alamgiri Gate of the Lahore Fort, which was also commissioned by Aurangzeb. The massive entrance and mosque are situated on a plinth, which is ascended by a flight of 22 steps at the mosque's main gate which. The gateway itself contains several chambers which are not accessible to the public. One of the rooms is said to contain hairs from the Prophet Muhammad's, and that of his son-in-law Ali.Black, p.21 Courtyard After passing through the massive gate, an expansive sandstone paved courtyard spreads over an area of 276,000 square feet, and which can accommodate 100,000 worshipers when functioning as an Idgah.Tikekar, p.73 The courtyard is enclosed by single-aisled arcades. Prayer hall The main edifice at the site was also built from red sandstone, and is decorated with white marble inlay. The prayer chamber has a central arched niche with five niches flanking it which are about one third the size of the central niche. The mosque has three marble domes, the largest of which is located in the centre of the mosque, and which is flanked by two smaller domes. Both the interior and exterior of the mosque are decorated with elaborate white marble carved with a floral design common to Mughal art. The carvings at Badshahi mosque are considered to be uniquely fine and unsurpassed works of Mughal architecture. The chambers on each side of the main chamber contains rooms which were used for religious instruction. The mosque can accommodate 10,000 worshippers in the prayer hall. Minarets At each of the four corners of the mosque, there are octagonal, three-storey minarets made of red sandstone that are tall, with an outer circumference of 67 feet and the inner circumference is eight and half feet. Each minaret is topped by a marble canopy. The main building of the mosque also features an additional four smaller minarets at each corner of the building.

Elimelech was a victim of a murder‚Äìsuicide in 1997 in which her boyfriend David Afuta killed her and then committed suicide. Biography Elimelech was born in Jerusalem in 1974 to Billy and Avi. In her youth, she studied in a high school in Gilo. In 1991, she won the first place in Jerusalem's \\"Miss Kenyon\\" beauty pageant, and then began modeling for the modeling agency \\"Look\\". During the Contest \\"Miss Kenyon\\" beauty pageant she met the successful hairdresser David Afuta (who had many high-profile clients such as the then Prime Minister's wife Sara Netanyahu amongst others◊§◊®◊©◊™ ◊î◊®◊¶◊ó ◊©◊ú ◊î◊ì◊ï◊í◊û◊†◊ô◊™ ◊¢◊†◊™ ◊ê◊ú◊ô◊û◊ú◊ö ◊©◊ï◊ë ◊ë◊ë◊ô◊™ ◊î◊û◊©◊§◊ò - ◊õ◊ú◊ú◊ô - ◊î◊ê◊®◊•), who was 14 years older than her, and they soon became a couple. In 1993, Elimelech participated in the Miss Israel beauty pageant and won the title \\"Queen of Grace\\" (◊û◊ú◊õ◊™ ◊î◊ó◊ü). In 1995, Elimelech received a lot of media exposure when she competed in an ongoing segment held during the Israeli version of the game show \\"Wheel of Fortune\\" during which contestants competed for the role of the new \\"Wheel Girl\\". Although she was very popular she eventually did not become the new \\"Wheel Girl\\". In 1996, Elimelech participated in the children's video tape \\"Efrochim\\" (◊ê◊§◊®◊ï◊ó◊ô◊ù) together with Asi Levi, Sherry Brzezinski and Sharon Tzur. During the same year she also participated in the children's video tape \\"Making A Movie: Golden Heart Flower\\" (◊¢◊ï◊©◊ô◊ù ◊°◊®◊ò: ◊§◊®◊ó ◊ú◊ë ◊î◊ñ◊î◊ë) together with Vicky (Vick) Tavor, Mali Chofesh and Tamar Milstein. During 1996, Elimelech also starred in the TV commercials for the Israeli supermarket chain \\"Hiperkol\\" (◊î◊ô◊§◊®◊õ◊ú). During the summer of 1997, Elimelech hosted the TV show \\"HaChofesh HaGadol\\" (◊î◊ó◊ï◊§◊© ◊î◊í◊ì◊ï◊ú) in the Israeli Educational Television. That same year, her relations with David Afuta worsened and as a result subsequently she moved back in with her father and his second wife. During the same year Elimelech was supposed to participate in the annual Israeli singing show \\"The Festigal\\" with the song \\"Ballerina\\", which subsequently was performed by the participants of the Festigal in her memory after her death. On the evening of December 1, 1997, the day before her death, Elimelech appeared along with the other participants of the Festigal Dudu Topaz's entertainment show on Channel 2.  The murder and the investigation  In the morning on December 2, 1997 Elimelech was found dead along with her boyfriend, David Afuta, in their home in the Ramat Beit HaKerem neighborhood in Jerusalem. She was shot once while he was shot twice. Shortly before the murder, Elimelech's father requested the Police to confiscate Afuta's personal weapon, for fear that he might use it against Elimelech, although the weapon was never taken from Afuta because Elimelech demanded that the complaint would be canceled. Preliminary investigations of the crime scene revealed that Elimelech was the one who shot Afuta and then committed suicide. The initial presumption, by which Elimelech was the murderer, originated on the basis that their bodies were found when the gun was in her hand. Based on these findings, Elimelech was initially buried in the suicide plot of the Jewish cemetery Har HaMenuchot in Jerusalem, in accordance with Jewish burial customs. Nevertheless, due to pressure from Elimelech's family, during the first month after the murder the police conducted a second investigation on the case in which the investigators discovered that the original team of investigators were negligent and that actually Afuta shot Elimelech and then killed himself. It was also revealed that Afuta's brother arrived first to the scene of the crime before the police, and in order to obscure the evidence, he moved the gun away from Afuta's hand to Elimelech's hand. Although this fact was verified in laboratory tests the prosecution decided, with the support of the police, not to initiate legal proceedings against Afuta's brother and he was released. According to the findings of the renewed police investigation, during the last years of her life Elimelech tried several times to leave Afuta, but Afuta did not let her go and threatened to commit suicide if she left him and as a result she always got back to him. The findings of the second investigation were published three weeks after the murder. Elimelech's bones were only moved away from the suicide plot of the Har HaMenuchot cemetery to the main burial plot of that cemetery during 2001, four years after her death. Court ruling  In 2004, Elimelech's father and brother filed a lawsuit against David Afuta's brother Joseph Afuta, demanding that the court would formally determine that Afuta was the murderer, and demanded a compensation of 8.4 million NIS.◊ú◊ê◊ó◊® 14 ◊©◊†◊î: ◊û◊©◊§◊ó◊™◊î ◊©◊ú ◊¢◊†◊™ ◊ê◊ú◊ô◊û◊ú◊ö ◊™◊§◊ï◊¶◊î ◊ë-300 ◊ê◊ú◊£ ◊©◊ß◊ú - ◊ï◊ï◊ê◊ú◊î! ◊ó◊ì◊©◊ï◊™ Eventually, on 1 March 2011 justice Menachem Cohen formally ruled that the murder was committed by David Aftuta who afterwards committed suicide. He also determined that his brother, Joseph Afuta, tampered with the evidence in the crime scene with the intention of incriminating Elimelech. As a result, the court ruled that Joseph would compensate Elimelech's family with 300,000 NIS.http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-4108693,00.html ReferencesExternal links *Court: Anat Elimelech was the victim in 1997 murder- suicide - posted on The Jewusalem Post on 03/02/2011 1974 births 1997 deaths Israeli Jews Israeli television actresses Israeli female models People from Jerusalem Murder‚Äìsuicides in Asia People murdered in Israel Deaths by firearm in Israel 20th-century Israeli actresses Miss International 1993 delegates Miss Israel delegates ","title":"Anat Elimelech"},{"id":"35991696","text":"Acraea pseudolycia is a butterfly in the family Nymphalidae.

The French 4e Division cuirass√©e (Colonel Charles de Gaulle), attacked the German-held village of Montcornet with over 200 tanks. The French drove off the Germans but later had to retreat due to lack of support and the intervention of the .  Background  On 10 May 1940, the Third Reich had launched a vast offensive against the Netherlands, Belgium and France. After the German breakthrough in the Battle of Sedan on 13 May, the Germans had driven the French troops to a hasty retreat. Prelude De Gaulle during World War II, wearing the two stars of a on his sleeve De Gaulle had just taken command of the new (4e DCr) on 12 May as the Germans were fighting to break through. That day, with three tank battalions assembled, less than a third of his paper strength, he was summoned to headquarters and told to attack to gain time for the Sixth Army (General Robert Touchon) to redeploy from the Maginot Line to the Aisne; it was his chance to implement his ideas of tank warfare. The next day, De Gaulle was appointed commander of the 4e DCr, comprising 5,000 men and 85 tanks, with which he led a counter-attack on the village of Montcornet on 17 May. Montcornet had strategic importance because it cut the roads to Reims, Laon and Saint-Quentin, and was a point of transit for the supply echelons of the 1st Panzer Division.  Battle  As De Gaulle advanced, he commandeered some retreating cavalry and artillery units and also received an extra half-brigade, one of whose battalions included some heavy B1 bis tanks. On 17 May, at elements of the 4e DCr advanced on Montcornet. After surrounding the village, around noon, the French B1 bis tanks came under fire from 3.7 cm Pak 36 anti-tank guns and from German tanks. Though outnumbered and without air support, he attacked and destroyed a German convoy south of the village. De Gaulle lost 23 of his 90 vehicles to mines, anti-tank weapons and to air attacks by Stukas. On 18 May he was reinforced by two fresh regiments of armoured cavalry, bringing his strength up to 150 armoured vehicles. De Gaulle ordered infantry to neutralise German defence pockets in Chivres and D2 tanks to secure Clermont-les-Fermes. Around De Gaulle ordered a new attack on Montcornet but because the tank crews had not received detailed maps of the sector and came under fire from 88mm Flak guns, the attack failed. Around German aircraft intervened and the 4e DCr retreated to its original positions. De Gaulle attacked again on 19 May and his forces were once again devastated by German Stukas and artillery. He ignored orders to withdraw and in the early afternoon demanded two more divisions from Touchon but was refused. Although de Gaulle's tanks forced the German infantry to retreat to Caumont, the action brought only temporary relief and did little to slow the spearhead of the German advance. It was one of the few successes the French enjoyed while suffering defeats elsewhere across the country. A number of the B1 bis tanks had to be abandoned when they ran out of petrol, and others when they sank into swamps.  Aftermath  The French lost 23 tanks in the attack, while the Germans had around 100 killed. De Gaulle fought another engagement at the Battle of Abbeville.

The killings were perpetrated by units of the Yugoslav Partisans in May 1945, following the Bleiburg repatriations. Summary executions began on 19 May when first prisoners arrived to the Tezno forest from nearby prison camps and continued until 26 May. Most of the bodies were buried in a several kilometers long antitank trench, which the Yugoslav authorities concealed and kept secret. It is estimated that around 15,000 soldiers and civilians were killed in the massacre. The graves were discovered in 1999 during a highway construction. Additional research of the burial sites was conducted in 2007 by the Commission on Concealed Mass Graves in Slovenia. In 2012, the Slovenian Government unveiled a memorial park at Tezno, where an annual commemoration is held. Background The retreating column approaching the town of Bleiburg in May 1945 In May 1945, at the end of World War II in Yugoslavia, soldiers of the Independent State of Croatia began retreating towards Austria, where British forces were located, with the intention to surrender to them rather than the advancing Yugoslav Partisans. Together with many civilians, the Croatian Armed Forces fought their way to the Yugoslav-Austrian border and surrendered on 15 May to the British Army. Around 25,000 reached the border, mostly the town of Bleiburg, while around 175,000 were spread in nearby columns that were dozens of miles long. However, the British Army refused their surrender on the grounds that all Axis troops should surrender to the armies they were fighting against. The prisoners of war at the border were thus repatriated to the Yugoslav Partisans. Forced marches and executions Prisoners of war in Maribor The captured columns were subjected to forced marches from the border area in northern Slovenia. A large number of prisoners marched towards the town of Maribor, where transit camps were set. The transit centres were located in a military barracks in the Studenci District, an aircraft parts factory in Tezno and several smaller buildings. As the columns moved away from the border with Austria, the prisoners were stripped of any valuables and given no food or water. To get to the destination more quickly, those who lagged behind were shot. Some were killed for taking a break or for being too tired to continue walking. In the course of the march, small groups of men were being selected from the columns, led away into the forest and killed. These killings were well organized and the work of entire units of men. Soon the killings of small groups turned into massive scale executions. The local Partisan headquarters that coordinated the columns was located in Maribor. Organized executions were generally not conducted without the authorization of OZNA (Department of National Security). On 19 May, the Commander of the 3rd Army, Kosta Naƒë, ordered the Majevica Brigade of the 17th Division to move to Maribor and subordinate itself to the local OZNA Command. At the transit camps a selection was made among the prisoners. Some were sent to Zagreb and Celje on forced marches or used as forced labour. Others were sent to Tezno near Maribor, where anti-tank trenches were located that were dug by the Germans during the war. Their length was several kilometers and stretched from the Drava River to the slopes of Pohorje Mountains. Prisoners were taken to the trenches by trucks from the transit sites. Their hands were tied behind their backs with wires and many were stripped of their clothes. Upon arrival, they were lined up on the edge of the trenches and shot. A former Partisan who witnessed the killings gave a description of one of them: The executions started on 19 May. Partisan units that conducted them were the Majevica Brigade, 1st, 2nd, and parts of 3rd Battalion of the 6th Eastern Bosnian Brigade, which were all part of the 17th Eastern Bosnian Division of the 3rd Army. The killings lasted continuously for several days and were delayed only in the case if trucks with prisoners were late. When the trenches were full, special squads were ordered to cover them with soil. Some bodies were dug in separate mass graves or craters. The last murders were carried out on 26 May. Aftermath The corpses were shallowly buried and in the following weeks and months additional conceals were made. The OZNA made a list of all mass grave sites in Slovenia. Together with the People's Defence Corps of Yugoslavia (KNOJ) they organized covering of the sites with land and plants. Local authorities were informed to prevent any mourning at the graves. Yugoslav authorities kept them secret; for decades, only limited access was allowed to the area. In 1984, it was designated by the government as a location of military cemeteries. Discovery and investigations of the graves After the fall of Communism in Yugoslavia, hundreds of unmarked mass graves were found in Slovenia. The Tezno mass graves were found during the construction of a motorway near Maribor in 1999, when workers came upon an anti-tank trench that stretched several kilometres. It was estimated that the part intended for the motorway contained around 600 corpses. Subsequent excavations revealed that there were 1,179 corpses in a 70 meter long part of the trench. On average there were 17 corpses found buried along each meter of it. The trench was covered with gravel and lime was found on top of the human remains. Most exhumed corpses indicated that the victims' arms were tied with wire. Individual skulls had visible gunshot wounds. In 1999, the Slovenian police initially estimated there were between 7,000 and 10,000 victims buried in the trenches. A new exhumation began in 2007. The Commission on Concealed Mass Graves in Slovenia reported that their analysis and conducted probing of what is now a forested area in Tezno found human remains at a length of 940 meters. Based on mathematical calculations and comparisons with the excavations in 1999, it is estimated to contain the remains of around 15,000 victims. Jo≈æe De≈æman, head of the Commission on Concealed Mass Graves, claimed Tezno was the largest mass grave in Europe following the end of World War II. The part of the trench in Tezno in Maribor is officially designated the Tezno Woods 1 Mass Grave. The Tezno Woods 2‚Äì6 Mass Graves () lie west of the settlement of Dogo≈°e, between the Zlatoliƒçje hydroelectric plant canal and Maribor, and are part of a former antitank trench.Prostorski sloj Prikrita vojna grobi≈°ƒça na geopedia.si, geopedia.si; accessed 27 July 2016. Commemoration Josip Leko, speaker of the Croatian Parliament, lays a wreath at the memorial park in Tezno in May 2015 After the discovery of the graves, memorials were erected commemorating the deaths of the victims. In September 2007, the Slovene government started plans to make the mass grave site in Tezno a memorial park and a cemetery. Croatian president Ivo Josipoviƒá visited the site in June 2010 and laid wreaths for the victims. In 2012, under Zoran Milanoviƒá's government, the Croatian Parliament decided to revoke funding for the annual Bleiburg commemoration and shifted to a smaller commemoration at the Tezno site. That year, President Josipoviƒá, Prime Minister Milanoviƒá and Speaker Boris ≈†prem, as well as Slovenian Prime Minister Janez Jan≈°a, visited the location and paid tribute to the victims. At the opening of the memorial park in June 2012, the President of Slovenia, Danilo T√ºrk, said: At the 2015 commemoration, the Croatian leadership condemned all crimes regardless of the ideology in whose name they were committed.

IBERC's principal products comprised a Quota Management Service and consulting capabilities to help users to make use of the data. IBERC clients included principally apparel and textile producing nations on the United States' quota and tariff system. Overview IBERC quota management system (database) was founded in the 1960s by lawyer, and former U.S. Army officer, Michael P. Davis. The firm broke up in 1986, when the chief executive, a recently retired United States Department of Commerce official, was investigated 1986 by the U.S. Department of Justice for alleged activities on behalf of the Government of Israel\\"Eye Mudge Rose-IBERC Israeli activities\\", Daily News Record (Thu, 31 Jul 1986) (International Business and Economic Research Corp., textile issue activities) in violation of the U.S. Foreign Agents Registration Act Dating- from the early 1990s, the IBERC database materials were managed by several different U.S. legal firms dealing with customs and trade affairs. i.e. the IBERC ceased to be a corporate entity, and remained as a product line offered by U.S.-based legal firms operating in the trade domain. The principal use of IBERC's quota management system was by governments, dealing with the Multi Fibre Arrangement (MFA) which was managed under the GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade), i.e. principal clients were either textiles manufacturers in these countries, or the governments which were contracting-parties to the GATT. IBERC is used today by governments as a textiles quota database. The IBERC database is owned and managed by firm Sandler, Travis and Rosenberg.  House Subcommittee investigation of IBERC  In 1986, the House Subcommittee On Commerce, Consumer, And Monetary Affairs Of The Government Operations Committee investigated IBERC Vice President Walter Lenahan, verifying his compliance with ethics laws. Mr. Lenahan was the former U.S. assistant secretary of Commerce for textiles and apparel, in relation to his move from the Commerce Department (International Trade Centre) to working with IBERC. The House Subcommittee investigated at that time if Mr. Lenahan had violated ‚Äúconflict of interest‚Äù laws, ‚Äúpost employment‚Äù laws, ‚ÄúFARA-laws‚Äù (Foreign Agent Registration Act) laws and the subject of former U.S. ITA (International Trade Agency) officials who left-office to represent foreign governments was examined. The subcommittee concluded that Mr. Lenahan may have violated a conflict of interest provision of U.S. Federal law, i.e. 18 U.S.C. 208.  IBERC breakup  In the context of the House, and a Department of Justice investigation, IBERC executives (themselves also former US-ITA, U.S. Department of Commerce officials) left the firm resulting in that the IBERC materials were subsumed by the new firm, International Development Systems, Inc., created by former US-ITA officers. The IBERC textiles quotation database was subsumed thereafter by the legal firm Mudge Rose Guthrie Alexander and Ferdon, which operated the IBERC textiles data materials into the 1990s.

It was later developed into the Short S.41 and Short S.45, which were the first of a long series of similar aircraft built for the RNAS and RFC. Design and development The origination of a tractor biplane design was due to Cecil Grace, who had flown a Bl√©riot tractor monoplane at Blackpool in 1910. Work was begun on a tractor version of the S.27 biplane design powered by a E.N.V. Type F, but after Grace's death at the end of the year the project was shelved, the aircraft being completed as a Type S.27.Barnes 1967, p.79 However, when Frank McClean was later shown the design by Horace Short, he asked for one to be built for him, to be powered by a Gnome Gamma engine. As first built, the aircraft was an unequal-span two- seater two-bay biplane, with ailerons fitted to the top wing only. The square section fuselage was mounted in the middle of the gap between the upper and lower wings, and the tail surfaces consisted of a rectangular rudder mounted on the sternpost of the fuselage, with a rectangular horizontal stabiliser and split elevator mounted in front of it on top of the fuselage. The centre section of the lower wing was left uncovered, as was the fuselage aft of the cockpit: the cockpit section of the fuselage was covered with plywood, with aluminium panels at the front enclosing the fuel tanks and extending forwards to form the cowling for the front-mounted Gnome Lambda engine. The undercarriage consisted of a pair of wheels below the wing leading edge, supplemented by skids extending forward to protect the propeller in case of a nose-over, and a single sprung tailskid mounted under the rear of the fuselage. The fuselage was subsequently rigged lower down, and the aft section of the fuselage covered with fabric.Barnes 1967, p.80-81 Service history The aircraft was first flown by McClean on 10 January 1912,Barnes p.80 and performed well, having a short takeoff run and a speed of .

This was part of the events referred to as the Bleiburg repatriations. Events In 1992, after Croatia became independent, 1163 bodies were excavated from 23 mass graves in the region, leaving around 130 possible mass grave locations unexplored. DNA analysis was conducted on a few hundred of them. The names of identified persons were not officially published, but it is clear that they were victims of a mass execution. A large number of the bodies were dropped into the area's many pits, making it difficult to locate all casualties. Further investigation on this issue was not conducted, and final conclusions about the excavations cannot be drawn yet. Some of those executions have been investigated, but no one has ever been prosecuted. Among those executed in Macelj were 25 Catholic priests from the Franciscan monastery of ≈†iroki Brijeg which were temporarily hidden in nearby Krapina.

On 20 May, the 2nd Panzer Division advanced to Abbeville on the English Channel, overran the 25th Infantry Brigade of the 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division and captured the town at Only a few British survivors managed to retreat to the south bank of the Somme and at on 21 May, the III Battalion, Rifle Regiment 2 reached the coast, west of Noyelles-sur-Mer. The 1st Armoured Division (Major-General Roger Evans) arrived in France from 15 May without artillery, short of an armoured regiment and the infantry of the 1st Support Group, which had been diverted to Calais. From 27 May to 4 June, attacks by the Franco-British force south of the Abbeville bridgehead, held by the 2nd Panzer Division, then the 57th Infantry Division, recaptured about half of the area; the Allied forces lost many of their tanks and the Germans much of their infantry, some units running back over the River Somme. On 5 June, the divisions of the German 4th Army attacked out of the bridgeheads south of the Somme and pushed back the Franco-British divisions opposite, which had been much depleted by their counter-attacks, to the Bresle with many casualties. In 1953, the British official historian, Lionel Ellis, wrote that the Allies lacked battlefield co- ordination, which contributed to the Allied failure to defeat the Germans and magnified the cost of lack of preparation and underestimation of the German defences south of the Somme. In 2001, Caddick-Adams also wrote of the chronic lack of battlefield communication within and between the British and French divisions, which was caused by a shortage of radios and led to elementary and costly tactical errors. The lack of communication continued after reinforcement by the 51st (Highland) Infantry Division (Major-General Victor Fortune) and French armoured and infantry divisions. The Germans had committed substantial forces to the bridgeheads, despite the operations in the north, that culminated in the Dunkirk evacuation The Somme crossings at Abbeville and elsewhere were still available on 5 June, for Fall Rot (Case Red), the final German offensive, which brought about the defeat of France.  Background =Battle of France After the Phoney War, the Battle of France began on 10 May 1940 when the German armies in the west commenced Fall Gelb. The German Army Group B invaded the Netherlands and advanced westwards. General Maurice Gamelin, the Supreme Allied Commander, initiated the Dyle Plan (Plan D) and invaded Belgium to close up to the Dyle river with the French First and Seventh armies and the British Expeditionary Force (BEF). The plan relied on the Maginot Line fortifications along the German‚ÄìFrench border to economise on troops and enable a mobile battle to be fought in Belgium. The Breda variant of Plan D required the Seventh Army to advance swiftly into the south-western Netherlands, to link with the Dutch army but the Germans advanced through most of the Netherlands before the French forces arrived. The attack into the Low Countries by Army Group B was a decoy, intended to attract the bulk of the most powerful French and British forces, while Army Group A advanced through the Ardennes further to the south, against second-rate French reserve divisions. The Germans crossed the Meuse at Sedan on 14 May, far too quickly for the Allies to react, then attacked down the Somme valley. On 19 May, the 7th Panzer Division (Major-General Erwin Rommel) attacked Arras but was repulsed and during the evening the SS Division Totenkopf (Gruppenf√ºhrer Theodor Eicke) arrived on the left flank of the 7th Panzer Division. The 8th Panzer Division further on the left reached Hesdin and Montreuil and the 6th Panzer Division captured Doullens after a day-long battle with the 36th Infantry Brigade of the 12th (Eastern) Division; advanced units pressed on to Le Boisle. On 20 May, the 2nd Panzer Division covered straight to Abbeville on the English Channel. Luftwaffe attacks on Abbeville increased, the Somme bridges were bombed and at a party from the 2/6th Queens of the 25th Infantry Brigade of the 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division, ran into a German patrol and managed to report that the Germans had got between the 2/6th and 2/7th Queens. The British infantry were short of equipment and ammunition and were soon ordered to retreat over the river; the 1/5th and 2/7th Queens found the bridges had been destroyed in the bombing. The Germans captured the town at and only a few British survivors managed to retreat to the south bank of the Somme. At on 21 May, the III Battalion, Rifle Regiment 2 reached the coast west of Noyelles-sur-Mer. The 1st Panzer Division captured Amiens and established a bridgehead on the south bank, over-running the 7th Battalion, Royal Sussex Regiment of the 37th (Royal Sussex) Infantry Brigade. Of the in the battalion, only to be captured but the operation deterred the Germans from probing further. The 12th (Eastern) Division and 23rd (Northumbrian) Division had been destroyed, the area between the Scarpe and the Somme had been captured, the British lines-of-communication had been cut and the Channel Ports were vulnerable to capture. The Army Group A war diarist wrote, At RAF Air Component Hawker Hurricane pilots reported a German column at Marquion on the Canal du Nord and others further south. Fires were seen in Cambrai, Douai and Arras which the Luftwaffe had bombed but the Air Component was moving back to bases in England. Communication between the Advanced Air Striking Force (AASF) in the south, the remaining Air Component units in the north and the Air Ministry was disorganised; the squadrons in France had constantly to move bases and operate from unprepared airfields, with poor telephone connexions. The AASF was cut off from the BEF; the Air Ministry and England-based squadrons were too far away for close co-operation. Two squadrons of bombers in England reached the column seen earlier at and bombed transport on the Bapaume road, the second squadron finding the road empty. After midday, Georges requested a maximum effort but only one more raid was flown, by two squadrons from around Albert and Doullens. During the night, Bomber Command and the AASF flew and lost five bombers. BEF During the winter of 1939‚Äì1940, BEF brigades had been detached for a period in the Maginot Line, to gain experience of conditions close to German troops. Saar Force was composed of the 51st (Highland) Infantry Division (Major-General Victor Fortune) and attached mechanised cavalry regiment, machine-gun battalions, artillery, French troops and a composite RAF squadron of fighters and army co-operation aircraft. From 30 April to 6 May, the force took over a line on the Saar from Colmen to Launstroff, between the French 42nd and 2nd divisions. In early May, German patrolling and skirmishing died down but on the night of many German aircraft flew overhead. On 13 May, the divisional front was bombarded and German infantry attacks were repulsed. More attacks followed on the Franco- British positions and on 15 May, the division was ordered back to the , before being relieved by the night of to concentrate at √âtain, west of Metz. Soon after the end of Operation Dynamo, the fighting and lines-of-communications troops south of the Somme were reinforced, losses in the three AASF fighter and six bomber squadrons in France were replaced and another two fighter and four bomber squadrons were sent from England. Advanced parties of the 1st Armoured Division (Major-General R. Evans) arrived at Le Havre on 15 May and moved to Arras but the German advance made operations in the area impossible and Luftwaffe bombing and mining of Le Havre made the port unsuitable for more landings. On 19 May, the War Office agreed that the rest of the division should land at Cherbourg and then concentrate at Pacy-sur-Eure, about south of Rouen. The rest of the division began to disembark on 19 May but had no artillery, was short of an armoured regiment and the infantry of the Support Group, which had been diverted to Calais. The division lacked wireless equipment, spare parts, bridging material and there were no tanks in reserve for the tanks and in the armoured brigades. On 21 May, Evans was ordered to capture crossings over the Somme from Picquigny to Pont-Remy and then be ready to operate to the east or north depending on circumstances. The area south of the lower Somme was the Northern District of the BEF supply system (Acting Brigadier Archibald Beauman) with sub-areas at Dieppe and Rouen. Beauman had received intelligence that the Germans had already captured the Somme crossings and were moving on the Seine bridges near Rouen. Beauman ordered the crossings to be secured by part of the divisional Support Group and next day part of the division concentrated in the For√™t de Lyons, east of Rouen as a flank guard on the lower Andelle and to protect the arrival of the rest of the division, due on 23 May. Early that day, part of the 1st Armoured Division advanced to the Bresle on a line from Aumale to Blangy, as reports were received that the German forces on the southern flank were on the defensive, only reconnoitring south of the river as they attacked St. Omer and Arras in the north. The French Seventh Army had closed up to German positions from P√©ronne to Amiens, ready to cross the river on 23 May. GHQ ordered an attack by the 1st Armoured Division, to combine with the Anglo-French operations at the Battle of Arras which had begun on 21 May. Lines of communication On the night of Allied forces north of the Somme were cut off by the German advance to St. Omer and Boulogne, which isolated the BEF from its supply entrep√¥ts in Brittany at Cherbourg and Nantes. Dieppe was the main medical base of the BEF and Le Havre the principal supply and ordnance source. From St. Saens to Buchy, north-east of Rouen, lay the BEF ammunition depot; infantry, machine-gun and base depots were at Rouen, √âvreux and l'√âpinay. A main railway line linking the bases and connecting them with bases further west in Normandy and with the BEF in the north, ran through Rouen, Abbeville and Amiens. Brigadier Beauman was responsible for base security and guarding which were under construction, with troops drawn from the Royal Engineers, Royal Army Ordnance Corps, Royal Corps of Signals and older garrison troops. Further south in the Southern District, were three Territorial divisions and the 4th Border Regiment, 4th Buffs and the 1st/5th Sherwood Foresters lines- of-communication battalions, which were moved into the Northern District on 17 May, as a precaution. Rail movements between the bases and the Somme quickly became difficult, due to congestion and German bombing, the trains from the north mainly carrying Belgian and French troops and the roads filling with retreating troops and refugees. Beauman lost contact with GHQ and was also unable to discover if Allied troops were going to dig in on the Somme or further south. On 18 May, Major-General Philip de Fonblanque, commanding the lines-of-communication troops, ordered Beauman to prepare defences in the Northern District. Beauforce was improvised from the 2nd/6th East Surrey of the 12th (Eastern) Division, 4th Buffs, four machine-gun platoons and the 212th Army Troops Company RE. Vicforce (Colonel C. E. Vickary) took over five provisional battalions, created from reinforcement troops in BEF infantry and general base depots, which held plenty of men but few arms and little equipment. Beauforce was sent by road to Boulogne on 20 May but the Germans had already cut off the port and it returned to the 12th Division near Abbeville. When German troops captured Amiens on 20 May and then began patrolling south of the river, their appearance caused panic and alarmist reports, in the absence of reliable information. Beauman ordered the digging of a defence line along the Andelle and B√©thune rivers, which were the most effective tank obstacles south of the Bresle river, to protect Dieppe and Rouen from the east. Bridges were prepared for demolition and obstacles placed on their approaches. Prelude=German defensive preparations On 21 May, Panzergruppe von Kleist prepared the Somme bridges for demolition and outposts were pushed as far south as Moyenneville, Huppy, Caumont and Bailleul, where anti-tank guns had been dug in and camouflaged among the woods. Later in the day orders arrived for the advance to resume northwards towards the Channel Ports but parts of the group were held back in reserve on 22 May due to the Allied counter-attack at Arras on 21 May, until reinforced by the XIV Corps and the 2nd Motorised Division began to take over the defence of the Somme bridgeheads the next day. The staff of Engineer Regiment 511 (Colonel M√ºller) and Engineer battalions 41 and 466 were added to the 2nd Motorised Division, ready to blow the Somme bridges in an emergency as the division probed south to the Bresle, Aumale and Conty. When the XIV Corps arrived it was to continue to expand the bridgeheads on the south bank. Allied offensive preparations After a reform of the French command structure in January 1940, the Allied chain of command in the region around Abbeville was G√©n√©ral d'arm√©e Maxime Weygand (Supreme Commander from 19 May), General Alphonse Joseph Georges (Commander North-Eastern Front [including the BEF]), General Besson (Groupe d'arm√©es 3), General Aubert Fr√®re (Seventh Army) General Robert Altmayer (Group A/Tenth Army) and General Marcel Ihler (IX Corps), in command of Evans and Fortune, with the BEF (Field Marshal Lord Gort) with a veto over French orders, by appeal to the War Office (Secretary of State for War Oliver Stanley) and having vaguer responsibilities for the British forces south of the Somme. In the afternoon of 18 May, Georges ordered the Sixth Army, Seventh Army and the 4e Division cuirass√©e (4e DCr, Colonel Charles de Gaulle) to organise the defence of the Crozat Canal line and the Somme, between Ham and Amiens. The Seventh Army was ordered to keep its forces ready for a counter-attack at the left flank of the attacking German forces. Troops withdrawing from Belgium, were to organise a defence line further west around Abbeville to the English Channel. From the SNCF railways moved divisions to the area from the Aisne to the Somme, despite German air superiority and the bombing of railway lines and junctions. The 2nd Armoured Brigade (Brigadier F. Thornton) consisted of the HQ and the Queen's Bays, 9th Queen's Royal Lancers and the 10th Royal Hussars armoured regiments. The HQ and the Bays had landed at Cherbourg on 20 May and had deployed on the Bresle from Aumale to Blangy. The other two armoured regiments arrived on the night of the crossed the Seine on 23 May to join the Brigade, arriving at Hornoy and Aumont on the Aunoy‚ÄìPicquigny road, having travelled since de-training. Thornton also had the 101st Light Anti-Aircraft and Anti-Tank Regiment (less Bofors guns) and three companies of the 4th Border from Beauforce from 24 May. An advanced party of the Bays from the 2nd Armoured Brigade moved forward during the night to Araines, from the Somme at Longpr√© and lost two tanks to mines trying to capture the bridge, then found that all the bridges and the road along the south bank had been mined, blocked and guarded. An attack was ordered on the bridges at Dreuil, Ailly and Picquigny, with a company of the 4th Borders and a troop of the Bays at each place. At Ailly, the Borders got two platoons across the river despite the bridge being blown but with the tanks stranded on the south bank the party was withdrawn. The groups at Ailly and Picquigny could not reach the river due to the strength of the German forces holding the bridgeheads, the Borders losing many casualties and the Bays several tanks. The Borders spent the night at a wood south of Ferri√®res and the Bays between that village and Cavillon. The 51st Highland Division arrived on the Channel Coast during the early Allied attacks on the German bridgeheads south of the Somme and assembled on the Bresle, after a difficult journey from the Saar due to German bombing, frequent changes of plan and delays caused by the big regrouping of the French armies south of the Somme. The divisional HQ was established at St Leger, south of Blangy on 28 May under the command of the French IX Corps. Plan The ground north of the Bresle is a flat plateau cut with wooded river valleys draining into the Bresle or the Somme and is dotted with villages obscured behind trees, among open fields with little cover. Under the impression that the Allied attack at Arras on 21 May, was the beginning of operations either side of the panzer corridor, to trap the German armoured spearheads at the end of the Somme valley, BEF GHQ for the 1st Armoured Division to advance with such units as were available without delay. (The \\"mangled remains of six panzer divisions\\" supposedly between the BEF and the Somme was actually a force of ten panzer divisions and by 23 May, motorised infantry divisions had arrived and dug in on the Somme crossings south of Amiens and Abbeville.) It was vital for the division to cross the Somme on the left of the French Seventh Army and advance on St. Pol to cut off German forces around St. Omer to relieve the right flank of the BEF. Evans thought that the division, arriving piecemeal, with the support group and an armoured regiment diverted to Calais, no artillery and with the Seventh Army unprepared, could not achieve such an ambitious objective but had no choice but to try. Georges passed orders to the Swayne Mission, the British liaison organisation at GQG, that the 1st Armoured Division was to mop up the Germans south of Abbeville, while the Seventh Army crossed the Somme. Gort at BEF GHQ replied that he wanted the division to attack, not pursue small German forces. General Robert Altmayer, the commander of Group B, the left flank units of the Seventh Army, sent other orders that the division must cover the left flank of the Seventh Army, for an attack on Amiens by that army. The Swayne Mission then confirmed that the division was not under the command of Altmayer and was to carry out the existing orders. Evans ordered the 2nd Armoured Brigade, the only part of the division available, to close up to the Somme that night. During the night of Evans was ordered by GHQ to co-operate with the French and wait in the existing positions. Georges had notified the Swayne Mission that the 51st Highland Division was moving from the Saar and would join the 1st Armoured Division to cover the ground from Longpr√© to the coast. On 24 May, Georges had informed the Groupe d'arm√©es 3 commander G√©n√©ral d'Arm√©e Antoine-Marie-Benoit Besson on the left flank of the Somme‚ÄìAisne line that the 1st Armoured Division was to hold the line until the 51st Highland Division arrived, establish small bridgeheads and prepare the bridges for demolition but by this time the Germans were south of the river. GHQ also reported that the Germans were well dug-in and had strong patrols, supported by light armoured cars between the bridgeheads and the Bresle. On 25 May Georges ordered (through the Groupe d'arm√©es 3) headquarters, that the German bridgeheads were to be destroyed, Evans was put under the command of the Seventh Army, with War Office agreement, which also ordered an all-out attack. The War Office was unaware that the French were incapable of an attack from the south bank of the Somme sufficiently powerful to succeed or that while preparing for Fall Rot the Germans would reinforce the bridgeheads, two divisions having already dug in from Amiens to the sea, with more divisions moving into the area. On 26 May, orders for the attack were issued, the 2nd Armoured Brigade came under the 2e Division L√©g√®re de Cavalerie (2e DLC, Colonel Berniquet) to take high ground from Bray to Les Planches, which overlooks the Somme south-east of Abbeville with support from French artillery and infantry. The 3rd Armoured Brigade was subordinated to the Division L√©g√®re de Cavalerie (5e DLC) for an attack on high ground from Rouvroy to St.-Valery- sur-Somme, also with French artillery and infantry. (British tank commanders stressed to G√©n√©ral d'arm√©e Besson, the commander of and Fr√®re the Seventh Army commander, that the British tanks were light tanks and cruiser tanks, similar to the equipment in French mechanised light divisions, not slow, heavily armoured infantry tanks like those in French armoured divisions. Battle=27 May The Allied attack began at after an hour's delay until the French artillery was ready. The 2e DLC and the attached British armoured brigade on the right flank, attacked from Hocquincourt, Frucourt and St. Maxent, east of the Blangy‚ÄìAbbeville road and the 5e DLC from the Bresle to north of Gamaches. Both DLCs, weakened by earlier fights, were unable to deploy any armour. There had been little time to reconnoitre and information about German dispositions was sparse. To succeed, armoured attacks would need to be combined with artillery and infantry but there were far too few troops and guns; Anglo-French co-operation was far from adequate. On the right flank, tanks failed to advance far and many were knocked out by close-range 37 mm Pak 36 anti-tank fire from Caumont and Huppy as they moved over ridges in between. On the left flank, the 3rd Armoured Brigade was able to reach high ground near Cambron and Saigneville and the edge of St.-Valery-sur-Somme on the coast. There was no infantry to follow up and consolidate the ground and the tanks were ordered to retire when it was discovered that the French were digging in behind them at Behen, Quesnoy and Brutelles. The 1st Armoured Division had knocked out, with some recovered and caused by lack of maintenance. Among the tanks put out of action were and Minor repairs could be undertaken locally but more substantial work had to be done at the divisional workshops south-west of Rouen, where repairs were slowed by a lack of spares. 28 May The French divisions on the Bresle attacked again, captured some German outposts and reached the Somme on both sides of the German bridgehead but failed to capture Abbeville and St. Valery, while the 1st Armoured Division recovered from its attack and reorganised, the 9th Lancers going into reserve and the remnants of the Bays and 10th Hussars being formed into a Composite Regiment of the 2nd Armoured Brigade. Georges sent Instruction 1809 reminding French commanders that the 1st Armoured Division was analogous to a French (DLM, mechanised light division) and not suitable for attacks on prepared positions and should be used with the 51st Highland Division on the left flank of IX Corps. The 4e DCr arrived, which although improvised, incomplete and having suffered many losses earlier in counter-attacks at the Battle of Montcornet (17 May), was much more powerful than the French cavalry divisions used earlier and could field cars (32 Char B1s, 65 Renault R35s, 20 SOMUA S35s, 20 Hotchkiss H35 mod√®le 39s and 14 Panhard 178s). The division attacked on 28 May, either side of the Blangy‚ÄìAbbeville road but was held up by the anti-tank defences in woods and a ridge running north-west from Villers sur Mareuil. The German front line was held by two battalions of InfanterieRegiment 217 reinforced by two companies of the Motorisierte Panzerabwehrabteilung 157 with a nominal strength of forty-eight The 4e DCr was also lacking in infantry and artillery for fire support and consolidation, deploying four battalions of motorised infantry and about seventy-two pieces. The French attack was preceded by an artillery bombardment, about shells being fired on the objective at Huppy. At two battalions of Char B1s advanced towards the German positions and destroyed most of the machine-gun nests. The German infantry of the 10th Company, IR 217 were routed when they saw that the had little effect on the French heavy tanks, claiming to have been attacked by French bombers and Char 2C (Giant Tanks). When the Char B1s continued their advance towards the Abbeville bridges, French infantry failed to keep up and indecision led the French tank crews to retire at dusk to their jumping-off positions and regroup. Eighteen Char B1s had been put out of action, three of which were repaired during the night. The 9th Company in reserve was ordered to counter-attack immediately on the west flank of the French penetration, to close the gap and destroy the French forces which had broken through. While the company was concentrating near Caumont, it was surprised by the arrival of a new wave of French tanks of the 44e BBC, a R35 tank battalion. The company engaged the tanks with four Pak 36 anti-tank guns but one was destroyed by from a R35, another was smashed by a tank and the crews of the other two were killed by tank machine-gun fire. The German company was overran but again, French infantry failed to keep up and the tanks retreated during the night. The 3e Cuirassiers cavalry unit was attached to the and at about attacked the eastern flank of the bridgehead with its Hotchkiss tanks, joined by the SOMUAs around The tanks had great difficulty overcoming French barricades at Bellevue and were harassed by accurate German fire, from which could crack the deck armour with direct hits. At about the tanks retired, having lost ten SOMUA S35s knocked out and thirteen Hotchkiss tanks which had broken down, suffered suspension damage or ditched. By the time when most of the French armour had withdrawn, the French infantry had advanced about into the bridgehead, more than half the distance to the bridges and taken about two hundred prisoners. The German III Battalion on the eastern flank, had been routed, spreading panic in the Caubert area with tales of French (monsters) and (steel fortresses). It was estimated that at best seventy-five men still had sufficient morale to defend themselves and the bridgehead collapsed, as the western flank had to be withdrawn to avoid it being encircled, reducing the area held by the Germans to about a sixth of its original extent. German artillery fire was suspended due to uncertainty about the location of French positions; De Gaulle was also ignorant of the extent of the French advance and the vulnerability of the Germans. He ordered the tank units to rest and regroup during the night, ready to renew the advance at first light The respite allowed German command to recover and organise a new defensive perimeter. 29‚Äì31 May On 29 May, the 4e DCr attacked again, with parts of the 2e DLC and 5e DLC, while the British largely remained in reserve. Due to the losses on the previous day, far fewer tanks could be deployed. The French armour consisted of fourteen Char B1s, twenty R35s and about a dozen cavalry tanks. They were reinforced by the remaining tanks of the British 1st Armoured Division, attached to 5e DLC. All these units concentrated their attack on the Mont de Caubert position, where German morale was still low. An important part of the German defence was Flak-Abteilung 64 which fielded about sixteen the armour-piercing ammunition of which could easily penetrate the Char B1 frontal armour. As the guns had been found to be ineffective, they were supplemented by for direct fire support. In the early morning, the Char B1s cleared the lower western and southern slopes of Mont de Caubert, against little resistance from the German infantry and destroyed a position for the loss of one tank. When trying to take the summit of Mont de Caubert, a flat area lacking any cover, they discovered it was defended by a number of which had a clear field of fire. The Char B1s attacked several times and used most of their ammunition for a loss of two tanks, after which they withdrew to the slopes to replenish later in the morning. The R35 battalion started to advance around and after clearing the area to the south-east of Caubert, reached the summit around noon and was immediately engaged by an outlying Surprised by what they mistook for a the French directed the fire of which destroyed the gun. The flanks of the bridgehead had crumbled as the 3e Cuirassiers advanced in the east and the 5e DLC progressed from the west, which routed the German troops in this sector. When the crews of the 5th Company saw the British tanks, they immediately withdrew, followed by much of the infantry. The retreat caused a panic among the supply and transport troops in the pocket, who fled over the Somme bridge into Abbeville. To prevent another rout, the German commanders ordered the 5th Company and other unreliable units out of the bridgehead, so that troops holding firm, such as the 2nd and 6th companies, would not be affected. Erich von Manstein, the XXXVIII Corps commander, was warned and rallied the personnel in Abbeville. G√ºnther von Kluge, the 4th Army commander, informed by Manstein that a \\"rather serious crisis\\" had developed, consented to an evacuation of the pocket, should this become unavoidable. The 2nd Motorised Infantry Division at Rue was alerted and sent out advance parties to reconnoitre. The orderly withdrawals over the bridge were seen by the French and at noon, De Gaulle issued an order announcing the German abandonment of the bridgehead and that the 4e DCr should immediately exploit this by advancing towards the river. The French advance came to a halt and at the Char B1 battalions asked for an artillery bombardment of the German defences on Mont de Caubert, to destroy the but this did not begin until Allied attacks at the west flank of the pocket at Cambron were stopped by close-range fire from and the R35 battalion did not advance and the German commanders sent the rallied troops back over the river, to raise their morale by conducting counter-attacks. German counter-attacks southwards from Mont de Caubert were repelled by from the Char B1s but the tanks were forced to expose themselves to the German guns and lost another four vehicles; by late afternoon only seven Char B1s were operational. German counter-attacks around Cambron became so threatening, despite the deployment of a battalion of the 51st (Highland) Division, that French cavalry tanks were moved from the east to the west side of the bridgehead to repulse them; a lull fell in the evening. The failure of the French completely to reduce the bridgehead, was caused by the German defenders, fatigue of the troops, tank losses and a false impression given in the order by De Gaulle, that the battle had already been won. The French had overrun about half of the bridgehead, inflicted severe casualties on German officers and NCOs, taken about and routed the men of more than two infantry battalions of the 57th Infantry Division (Lieutenant-General Oskar Bl√ºmm). After three hours, the German infantry had rallied and reoccupied their positions unopposed; the offensive ended on 30 May, the French having lost in three days. 1‚Äì3 June Weygand abandoned the northwards counter-offensive over the Somme and Aisne rivers by 1 June but wanted the attacks on German bridgeheads south of the Somme to continue, as a defensive measure against the expected German offensive against Paris. Georges ordered a pause in the Seventh Army attacks, to regroup ready for an attack on 4 June. became the Tenth Army, which included the 1st Armoured and 51st Highland divisions, in IX Corps, in which the 4e DCr was replaced by the 31st (Alpine) Division and the (2e DCr). The troops under Beauman were organised as the Beauman Division, with three improvised infantry brigades, an anti-tank regiment, a field artillery battery and service troops. Karslake was informed by the government that ad hoc forces should go back to England, with only enough lines-of-communication troops retained to support an armoured division, four infantry divisions and the AASF but Georges persuaded the War Office to keep the Beauman Division on the Andelle‚ÄìB√©thune line. From 1 to 3 June, the 51st Highland Division (still over-strength because of the attachments for Saarforce), the Composite Regiment and the remaining elements of the 1st Support Group, relieved the two French divisions opposite the Abbeville‚ÄìSt. Valery bridgehead, with the 153rd Infantry Brigade in reserve on the Bresle from Blangy to Senarpont; of the river on the right were held by a small force, with the Composite Regiment further back between Aumale and Forges; downstream a pioneer battalion held a stretch. The Beauman Division held a line from Pont St. Pierre, south-east of Rouen to Dieppe on the coast, which left the British units holding an front, of the Bresle and of the Andelle‚ÄìB√©thune line, with the rest of IX Corps on the right flank. 4 June The Mont de Caubert spur runs northwards from the village of Mareuil- Caubert and there is a ridge west of Rouvroy which dominate the roads into Abbeville from the south. An Allied attack was planned for the 31st (Alpine) Division and the 2e DCr; on the right flank of the 2e DCr, the 152nd Infantry Brigade of the 51st (Highland) Division was to capture Caubert and woods from there to Bray. The 153rd Infantry Brigade on the left of the 31st (Alpine) Division, was to capture high ground south of Gouy and the 154th Infantry Brigade was to stand fast and engage German defenders around St.-Valery-sur- Somme by fire, to stop them being used to reinforce the Abbeville bridgehead; the Composite Regiment was to remain in reserve at St. L√©ger. The French divisions came under the command of Fortune, having recently arrived and having had little time to prepare or reconnoitre. There were few photographs from air reconnaissance and the briefing of the troops was rushed, some parts of the 31st division only arriving before zero hour. The German defences were mostly unknown and there were no aircraft to conduct artillery observation sorties, to guide the guns onto artillery emplacements and infantry forming-up areas. Zero hour was set for and a mist filled the Somme valley, light enough for the attackers to assemble but not for this to be seen from afar and at an Allied artillery barrage fell on woods around Beinfay and Villers and then the 2nd Seaforth advanced to capture German positions on the fringes of the woods, despite French heavy tanks not arriving. The objectives were captured but when the French tanks appeared, the barrage had stopped and as they drove between the Blangy‚ÄìAbbeville road and the woods, entered a minefield and were engaged by German anti-tank guns and artillery. Several tanks triggered mines, blew up or caught fire and more were knocked out by the German guns but the rest reached the foot of Mont Caubert and Mesnil Trois Foetus. The 4th Seaforth were due to follow up supported by light tanks and when three arrived advanced on the south-east side of the woods near Villers, where they were received by massed machine-gun fire from Mont de Caubert and repulsed. When the heavy tanks were ordered back to the start line, only six of the tanks and the tanks returned. The attack of the 4th Camerons south of Caubert failed against well dug-in German machine-guns, although some troops advanced far enough to fight hand-to-hand. Two platoons got into Caubert and were cut off, the 152nd Brigade losing in its attack. On the left, an attack by a regiment of the 31st (Alpine) Division was quickly stopped by German troops dug in among woods to the west of Mesnil Trois Foetus but the attack of the 153rd Infantry Brigade on the left flank had more success. The 1st Black Watch attacked from the Cahon valley and reached Petit Bois and the 1st Gordon attacked from Gouy, pushed the Germans out of Grand Bois and reached their objective on high ground to the east at noon. The 1st Gordon were assisted by a system of Very light signals worked out with the artillery, which enabled them to direct the artillery onto German machine-gun nests but with the Germans still occupying the high ground north-west of Caubert, the area was untenable and the 1st Gordon were ordered back to their start line. Aftermath=Analysis Confusion over Franco-British command arrangements south of the Somme was to an extent sorted out on 25 May, when the 51st (Highland) Division was subordinated to Ihler, the IX Corps commander, part of Groupe A (Altmayer) of the Seventh Army (Fr√®re) and the 1st Armoured Division to Groupe A, which then became the Tenth Army. Military Mission 17 led by Lieutenant-General James Marshall-Cornwall, joined the Tenth Army HQ to co-ordinate British operations with the French. The inadequacy of previous command arrangements was exposed by unrealistic expectations of the French as to the capacity of the 1st Armoured Division, which was equipped with fast, lightly armoured light and cruiser tanks, not the heavily armoured types in French armoured divisions. Altmayer still used the 2nd and 3rd Armoured brigades in the attack on 27 May, which cost the British losses, for little gain in ground, which had to be given up for lack of infantry to consolidate. When the 4e DCr attacked from the German anti-tank guns shot away tank aerials and pennants but bounced off the armour. Some German troops panicked and ran away, captured and the French retook about half of the Abbeville bridgehead. Again, the Allies had too few infantry to hold the captured ground and ended back on their start lines, minus the 4e DCr tanks. Allied attacks were reduced in effect by a chronic lack of tactical communication, caused by an inadequate number of radios. Tanks, infantry and artillery could not stay in contact or talk to their divisional headquarters and inter-army tactical liaison was only possible at the lowest level. On 4 June, French tanks drove onto a minefield in an area thought to be held by the 51st Highland Division. The highlanders had been moved back during the evening of 3 June and had failed to notify the French troops on the flanks; German troops followed up and planted the mines in an obvious tank avenue between woods. In 1953, the British official historian, L. F. Ellis wrote that the Allied attacks on the Abbeville bridgehead lacked battlefield co-ordination, which contributed to the Allied failures to overcome the German defences and magnified the effects of lack of preparation, the persistent underestimation of the strength of the German positions south of the Somme and ignorance of the assembly of Army Group B on the north bank of the Somme, ready to commence Fall Rot, which was due to begin on 5 June, against Allied positions from Caumont to Sallenelle on the coast, south of St. Valery. In 2001, Caddick-Adams wrote that when the 51st (Highland) Division arrived from the Saar and relieved parts of the 4e DCr, 2e DLM and 5e DLM, it had a front of to hold. When Fall Rot began on 5 June the Tenth Army units opposite the German bridgeheads from Abbeville to the sea were pushed back to the Bresle and further back on 8 June. Defeatism spreading through the French army was reflected in the Tenth Army HQ, which ceased to operate from Casualties On 27 May, the attacks of the 1st Armoured Division, 2e DLC and the 5e DLC cost the British knocked out and another mechanical breakdowns. From the 4e DCr lost and on 4 June the Franco-British force lost about fifty tanks and other armoured vehicles. 5 June On 5 June, Fall Rot (Case Red), a German offensive to complete the defeat of France began and Army Group A (Colonel General Gerd von Rundstedt), attacked either side of Paris towards the Seine. The 4th Army offensive on the Somme began at opposite the 51st (Highland) Division at St.-Valery-sur-Somme. German infantry moved forward against Saigneville, Mons, Catigny, Pend√©, Tilloy and Sallenelle held by the 7th and 8th battalions, Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders (Argylls), as other troops passed between them, the villages being too far apart for mutual support. Saigneville, Mons, Catigny, Pend√© and Tilloy fell late in the afternoon and the 7th Argylls were surrounded at Franleu, by troops infiltrating between Mons and Arrest as they were attacked. The 4th Black Watch in reserve, were ordered forward to relieve Franleu but were stopped by German troops at Feuqui√®res and an Argylls company sent forward was surrounded at the edge of Franleu. By dark, the remnants of the 154th Infantry Brigade had been pushed back to a line from Woincourt to Eu. On the right, the 153rd Infantry Brigade was bombarded by Ju 87 Stuka dive-bombers as well as by mortar and artillery fire. The German infantry pushed the battalion back to T≈ìufles, Zoteux and Fri√®res, where British machine-gun and artillery fire stopped the advance. The 31st (Alpine) Division was forced back parallel to the British from Limeux to Limercourt and B√©hen, with the 152nd Infantry Brigade on the right retreating from Oisemont to the Blangy‚ÄìAbbeville road. Further to the east at Bray, the 1st Lothians were attacked and fell back to the east of Oisement. The Composite Regiment had several engagements and had some tank casualties before rallying at Beauchamps on the Bresle. The 51st Highland and 31st (Alpine) divisions had tried to hold a front and were so depleted after the bridgehead attacks up to 4 June, that the 1st Black Watch had been required to hold a front, in close country.

Sometimes she used the stage name Ria Poncelet. She started her career as an acrobat and played in nearly 30 German films, including three films in which she was the partner of Peter Alexander. Early life and career She was born as Germaine Haeck in Petingen (Luxembourg). She was the third of four daughters of metallurgical worker Dominique Haeck and his wife Barbara Poncelet. At the gymnastics club of Nidderkuer (Niederkorn) in Luxembourg, the 5-year-old Damar laid the foundations for her future career. With her sister Geny and two gym teachers she formed the acrobatic quartet Los Habaneros. On 10 May 1940, after the invasion of Luxembourg by the German troops, she fled with her parents and siblings to Paris. There, the 12-year-old continued to develop her talents and she performed with her sister Geny and her former gym teacher Atilio Bariviera as Trio Deluxe at the Alhambra and the Bobino. She also took dance classes and was trained in acting and ballet. After World War II, she started a solo career and toured through Europe. She travelled to North Africa and the Orient to perform there with her sister Sylvie and Sylvie‚Äôs husband as Trio Vialine. In Cairo, they even performed for King Farouk. She used as her stage name Ria Poncelet. In Cairo she also met the actress Zarah Leander, who mediated a screen-test for her in Hamburg in 1952 at Herzog Filmverleih. Although director Robert A. Stemmle was not satisfied with the test, she soon landed her first film role. Director G√©za von Cziffra sought a talented dancer to replace the ill Maria Litto in his revue film Tanzende Sterne (Dancing Stars, 1952). He watched the screen-test and gave her the lead part opposite Georg Thomalla. She changed her name from Germaine Haeck into Germaine Damar and the press concluded for some time that she was a French dancer. Tanzende Sterne (Dancing Stars, 1952) became Damar's breakthrough. Herzog Filmverleih offered her a 5-year contract and she went on to play in a total of 28 films. She appeared in such light entertainment fare as S√ºdliche N√§chte (Southern Nights, 1953, Robert A. Stemmle), Die Drei von der Tankstelle (The Three from the Filling Station, 1955, Hans Wolff) with Walter Giller, and Symphonie in Gold (Symphony in Gold, 1956, Franz Antel) opposite Joachim Fuchsberger. Her best known musical was Die Beine von Dolores (The legs of Dolores, 1957, G√©za von Cziffra) with Claus Biederstaedt. In France she made the western musical S√©r√©nade au Texas (Serenade of Texas, 1958, Richard Pottier) with Bourvil and Luis Mariano. In three films she was the partner of Peter Alexander. These were the comedies So ein Million√§r hat's schwer (It‚Äôs so hard to be a millionaire, 1958, G√©za von Cziffra), Peter schie√üt den Vogel ab (Peter shoots the bird, 1959, G√©za von Cziffra) and Salem Aleikum (1959, G√©za von Cziffra). In the early 1960s Damar made two films in Spain, the comedies Cari√±o m√≠o (Darling, 1961, Rafael Gil) and Escala en Hi-Fi (Scale in Hi-Fi, 1963, Isidoro M. Ferry). Her film Die Beine von Dolores was such a big hit in Argentina, that Damar moved for three years to South America. There she became a popular star with her own TV show. In Germany, Damar had dated with actor Georg Thomalla and producer Andreas C. Schuller, who had ruined her with his flop Gl√ºck und Liebe in Monaco (Love and Happiness in Monaco, 1959, Hermann Leitner). In Argentina, she met the American manager Roman G. Toporow and married him. Late years In 1964, Damar retired and two years later her son Roman Martin Toporow was born. Her husband died in 1993, and Damar has since then lived with her son in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. In June 2011 the documentary Germaine Damar ‚Äì Der tanzende Stern (Germaine Damar, the dancing star) by Michael Wenk was presented at the Luxembourg cinema Cin√© Utopia. The former dancing star herself was present and even sang one of her old songs. The audience gave her a standing ovation.

Municipally, it is incorporated as Yefimovskoye Urban Settlement, one of the three urban settlements in the district. Population: History In the 19th century, the place where Yefimovsky is currently located, was a part of Sominskaya Volost of Ustyuzhensky Uyezd, Novgorod Governorate. In 1918, it was transferred in newly created Cherepovets Governorate. In the second half of the 19th century (the dates of 1862 and 1882 are mentioned in the sources) a glass-making factory was built by Lanko, a German merchant. The settlement serving the glass-making factory was known as Bystroretsky and is currently a part of Yefimovsky (Bystroretskaya Street). In 1905, a railway station was opened on the railway connecting Podborovye and Tikhvin. The name of the station was Somino, however, in 1908 it was renamed Yefimovskaya. The settlement of Yefimovsky was initially serving the railway station. On August 1, 1927, the uyezds were abolished, Yefimovsky District with the center in the settlement of Yefimovsky was established as part of Cherepovets Okrug of Leningrad Oblast. On July 23, 1930 the okrugs were abolished as well, and the district became directly subordinate to the oblast. On February 1, 1963 the district was abolished, and, after a short period, was merged into Boksitogorsky District. In 1957, the first brick house was built in Yefimovsky. In December 1964, Yefimovsky was granted work settlement status. Economy=Industry The economy of Yefimovsky is based on timber industry and food industry. Transportation Yefimovsky is a principal station on the railroad connecting Saint Petersburg and Vologda. It is also connected by roads to the A114 highway between Vologda and Saint Petersburg. The Tikhvinskaya water system, one of the waterways constructed in the early 19th century to connect the river basins of the Volga and the Neva, passes close to Yefimovsky.

Unfortunately, he also left her broke, living in Rhode Island and working as a receptionist in a museum run by her aunt Clara (Lorne). A stroke of luck comes Kim's way when notified that an uncle in Las Vegas has died and left her a 50% interest in a hotel-casino. She excitedly takes Aunt Clara there, but in reality, the hotel is a ramshackle mess and her partner is heavily in debt. Kim is deceived into believing that the hotel she owns is actually the thriving Flamingo Hotel, right across the street. So it comes as quite a surprise to its real owner, Victor Monte, when a total stranger begins behaving as if the place is hers. Taffy Tremaine is performing there, and she's just jealous enough to be concerned that Victor might take a fancy to this new woman rather than to her. Kim eventually learns the truth about the two hotels, but catches a break by being introduced to Elliot Atterbury, a naive rich boy who'd like to own a Vegas hotel. Together they spruce up Kim's hotel, rename it, hire Taffy to perform and give the Flamingo a run for its money. Taffy happily takes up with Elliot instead, while Victor concedes defeat. Once a gambler who lost everything, as Kim's father did, he tells Kim that he's gone broke again from losses at the tables and from the Flamingo's loss of business, so he's leaving town. Kim persuades him to stay, wanting them to become partners in more ways than one. Victor agrees, whereupon Kim learns that he and the Flamingo are actually having no money troubles at all, their new partnership being what he'd had in mind all along.

David shoots a man who accuses him of cheating at cards, pleading self-defense. Dr. O'Brien can't help but admire and be attracted to Julia, but she declines his marriage proposal, citing prejudices like his toward women as the reason she left Boston in the first place.

Fighting The Blitzkrieg The 4DCr launched an attack on 17 May at the Battle of Montcornet, where it successfully threw back the German defenses but had to retreat on its starting positions for lack of support and air cover. It then moved south of Abbeville to attack German bridgeheads across the Aisne river, fighting the Battle of Abbeville on 28/29 May with the aim of breaking through to the encircled Allied units trapped in Dunkirk. On 1 June, the 4e DCr was relieved by the 51st (Highland) Infantry Division and regrouped at Marseille- en-Beauvaisis to attach itself to the armoured group under General Charles Delestraint. On 6 June, De Gaulle was relieved of his command to rejoin his new commission as State under-secretary for War in the government. De Gaulle was replaced by Colonel Chaudesolle for one day. General Pierre Jules de la Font took command of the division on 7 June. On 10 June, the armoured group was attached to the Paris Army, and on 12 June, the division was assigned to the 10th Army Corps.

A. G. Lucas, began in 1976 and was constituted to look into police corruption in Queensland. It was prompted by the Queensland Council for Civil Liberties, along with the Queensland Law Society, who demanded an inquiry into police corruption.Clarke, Eddie. Guardian of Your Rights:Queensland Council for Civil Liberties: A History, 1966‚Äì2007. Brisbane: Supreme Court of Queensland Library, 2008. Print. Background The Lucas Inquiry emanated from the \\"Southport Betting Case,\\" a trial where a number of high-ranking police officers were alleged to have fabricated evidence to clear two bookmakers of prosecution.\\"Report of a Commission Inquiry Persuant to Orders in Council\\" In November 1974 two suspected \\"starting price\\" bookmakers, Brian Leonard George Sieber and Stanley Derwent Saunders, were charged and arrested \\"with possession of instruments of betting\\" and it was alleged these two men and many other bookmakers operating in Brisbane and on the Gold Coast were chief sources of \\"corrupt payments to police\\" in the Licensing Branch, a subsection of the Criminal Intelligence Unit. The CIU was a police department \\"formed to collect, record and disseminate intelligence on organized crime and corruption, and to apprehend and prosecute those involved.\\" In 1975, the results of the trial found neither men guilty and the loss was devastating to the campaign against both corruption and the integrity of the CIU. \\"The Criminal Intelligence Unit had failed to secure a prosecution in a seemingly iron-clad case-one where money was actually paid over, the vital conversations had been taped and most of the activities had been observed by members of the CIU.\\" This \\"cover up\\" prompted the investigation into police behaviour, resulting in the Lucas Inquiry. Terry O'Gorman said at the National Convention on Civil Liberties, held in 1976, ‚Äúthe conclusions on the Southport Case cast serious doubt on the reliability and integrity of inspectors in the Queensland Police Force.\\" \\"Subject or Citizen.National Convention on Civil Liberties.Fryer Box 3.1976.\\" Aims The aims of the inquiry were to: *Investigate police fabrication of evidence and testimonies; *Protect individuals from police interrogation and harassment and; *To discover whether police have too much power interrogating, searching and arresting citizens.Geraghty, J.M. The Citizen and the Police: A Publication of the Queensland Council for Civil Liberties. Brisbane: Queensland Council for Civil Liberties.1982. Print Findings The Lucas report resulted in findings of significant police misconduct and corruption, assault and proof of police \\"planting evidence, forging warrants and fabricating confessions.\\" One of the reports recommendations were that police interviews be recorded to reduce verballing. O'Gorman, although praising the recommended introduction of tape recordings during police interviews, was highly critical of the report as there were no police charged with misconduct and many were even promoted.(7 August 2008). Civil Libertarian and Criminal Lawyer Terry O'Gorman. ABC Local conversations with Richard Fidler. Abc.net.au. Retrieved on 7 May 2012. He said \\"the inquiry has made the comment that here we have these officers who have not only not been proceeded against but a number of the principal offenders have been promoted. What sort of a police force do we have if the upper echelons of the police force are led to believe that mis-deeds will be rewarded by subsequent promotion.‚Äù \\"Subject or Citizen.National Convention on Civil Liberties.Fryer Box 3.1976.\\" See also *Fitzgerald Inquiry References History of Queensland Police misconduct in Australia Public inquiries in Australia 1970s in Queensland ","title":"Lucas Inquiry"},{"id":"35992139","text":"Es campur (Indonesian for \\"mixed ice\\") is an Indonesian cold and sweet dessert concoction of fruit cocktails, coconut, tapioca pearls, grass jellies, etc. served in shaved ice, syrup and condensed milk.

History Though the Fell & Rock Climbing Club, established 1906 for Lake District climbing, was open to both men and women, women were excluded from many climbing clubs. A Ladies' Alpine Club was founded in 1907 and the Ladies' Scottish Climbing Club in 1908. The brainchild of Emily (Pat) Kelly, a Fell and Rock member, the Club was intended to encourage independent rock climbing among women. The Pinnacle Club was founded at a meeting chaired by Eleanor Winthrop Young at the Pen Y Gwryd Hotel in Snowdonia on 26 March 1921, attendees being women already known to the organisers. Subsequently, a letter was published in the Manchester Guardian inviting women to contact the Secretary if they were interested in joining. Despite Pat Kelly's death following an accident in 1922, the Club prospered. Eminent climbers who have been members over the years include Nea Morin, Dorothy Pilley, Brede Arkless, Gwen Moffat and Angela Soper. International Events The first international event held in Llanberis in 1984 saw the first female E5 ascent by Jill Lawrence. In 2016 a second event was held with over eighty climbers of all standards from making their first traditional climb to climbing E7.

Personal  Epstein was born in Brisbane. He became a paraplegic in 1972 following a gym accident. He became a member of the Sporting Wheelies and Disabled Association in 1977 and competed in a number of sports including wheelchair basketball and athletics before focusing on weightlifting. He was admitted as a Chartered Accountant in 1985 and joined the Sporting Wheelies and Disabled Association as Administration and Finance Manager in 1990. He was the chief executive officer of the Association from 1998 to December 2016, and was appointed to the Board of the Queensland Academy of Sport in 2008. In 2002, his wife Vicki wrote the book Step by step we conquer : the story of Queensland's Sporting Wheelies and Disabled Association.

Early life and education  Krystal's parents, Shloime and Mila Krystal, both from Warsaw, Poland, survived World War II in Russia and immigrated to the United States in 1952. He attended the Bronx High School of Science from 1963 to 1965, the University of Wisconsin at Madison from 1965 to 1969, and Columbia University in 1970. After working at a series of jobs, he became a part-time editor at Basic Books in New York City.  Career  Krystal has written for publications including The American Scholar, Harper's, The New Yorker, The New York Times Book Review, the Times Literary Supplement, The Wall Street Journal, the Chronicle of Higher Education, the Washington Post Book World, New York Newsday, the Village Voice, the New Criterion, the Los Angeles Review of Books, Sports Illustrated, Art & Antiques, the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, and Collier's Encyclopedia.

Many of Krystal's essays have stirred up controversy for their insistence that intellectual work not be limited or defined by sociopolitical concerns when executed in good faith.

The repayment includes all the interests and financial charges agreed at the signing of the credit agreement. Closed-end credits include all kinds of mortgage lending and car loans.  Types  In case of mortgages the total is divided into monthly installments so that a person should repay certain amounts of principal plus interest. After the last repayment is made the right for the property is transferred to the borrower. The same scheme refers to an auto loan. It is extended for a fixed period during which a person makes repayments. The latter also includes principal and interest and a borrower gains the right for a vehicle as soon as the final repayment is made. However, closed-end credits of auto type differ from the mortgage ones as they are considerably shorter and in the majority of cases have got fixed interest rates.  Features  The advantage of closed- end credits is that they allow a person to achieve good credit score image, provided that all the repayments are made in time. Auto loans are especially beneficial in this respect. Successful management of a closed-end credit is a very demonstrative indicator for future lenders. The peculiar feature of closed-end credits is that they preserve the same interest rate level and the loan principal is not increased after the disbursement of funds or after the partial repayment. Opposed to closed-end credits there are also open-end credits that are also known as revolving credit lines. The most widespread among them are credit card loans. All the types of credits in the U.S. are regulated by the laws. One of them is The Truth in Lending Act (TILA). It was implemented by the Board's Regulation Z (12 CFR Part 226) and is aimed at providing information and customer protection. It was introduced in order to spread information about all customer loans and to enforce lenders to adequately disclose information about terms and cost of a loan.

Biography From the Manchu He≈°eri clan, although his family was not rich and he had no formal schooling, Ying became well versed in the Confucian Classics as a child. After his fiance was nursed to health by the Sisters of Charity at a Catholic hospital in Beijing, Ying became interested in the writings of Matteo Ricci and several of scholars he converted to Christianity in the late Ming Dynasty. These writers convinced Ying that Confucianism and Christianity, Chinese culture and Western culture, were essentially complementary with each other. Ying was the founding editor of the Ta Kung Pao in Tianjin in 1902. Ying edited the paper for the next decade, and his extensive writings were influential both for their support of liberal politics and their use of the vernacular language. After the Revolution of 1911, he turned his attention to Catholic education, founding the Fu-jen School for girls. Ying and his friends the reformist priest Vincent Lebbe and the Catholic layman Ma Xiangbo had become increasingly frustrated and resentful over the control of the Chinese Catholic Church and all Catholics in China exercised by the French government and French priests, who constituted 70% of the clergy in China. They called for the Church in China to be controlled by Chinese priests appointed by the Vatican rather than French ones, who blocked the reform efforts of the Pope. Lebbe arranged for an essay of Ying's to be translated into French and sent to Rome. Ying frankly explained that the chauvinism and disdain for Chinese among the French clergy in China was extremely demoralizing for Chinese priests. Ying's critical voice was a major factor in the decision of Pope Benedict XV to direct the founding of a Catholic university, Fujen University, in Beijing. Ying took responsibility for much of the organization and start-up of the university, which opened in 1925. He died of cancer on 2 March 1926 in Beijing. Personal life Ying married Shuzhong (), a member of the Qing dynasty royal family. Ying Hua's son, Ying Qianli, was an active lay leader in the Catholic Church during the early Republican era. His grandson, Ying Ruocheng, was a prominent actor after 1949 and China's vice minister of culture from 1986-1990. His great grandson, Ying Da, is a prominent actor, director, talk show host, and television show creator in Beijing. His great great grandson, Rudi Ying, is a professional ice hockey player.

Violence and property crime associated with the event has turned many locals against the festival. It was reported in the New York Times that many South Beach residents leave the area during Urban Beach Week. Mayor Matti Herrera Bower has said the city doesn't have much ability to end Urban Beach Week, considering that the tourists who come for the Memorial weekend don't come for city permitted events, but for private concerts and parties.\\"Man Shot To Death By Police Wanted In Boynton Beach Shooting\\", CBS Miami, June 2, 2011.  Police response  After a fatal shooting of an armed suspect by police in 2011, city leaders considered cutting back drinking hours or imposing a curfew; both ideas were considered unworkable. Also rejected was a plan to make the festival a city-sanctioned and organized event. Instead, the city and the Police Department increased the turnout of law enforcement in 2012, with a tougher stance on minor infractions. Nearly 600 officers were on duty. Lanes were closed on the causeways leading to Miami Beach, and license plate readers were used to check for outstanding warrants, stolen cars and suspended licenses. Watch towers were put up to better observe the main promenade on Ocean Drive. Civil-rights groups expressed their concern in a letter signed by executive director of the ACLU of Florida, Howard Simon, former president of the Greater Miami ACLU chapter, John de Leon, and Bradford E.

Wright and starring Gene Autry, Ann Rutherford, and Smiley Burnette. Based on a story by Oliver Drake, the film is about a Pony Express rider who is robbed and left to die in the desert, where he is saved by a wild horse he captures and later uses to round up other horses to be used in the race for a government contract. Plot While delivering mail in California in 1880, Pony Express rider Gene Autry (Gene Autry) is ambushed by two men who steal his saddlebags and leave him to die in the desert. In addition to the mail, the saddlebags contain money being sent to ranch owner Dolores Moreno (Ann Rutherford) who desperately needs the funds to save her land from being sold for back taxes. At Dolores' Vista Grande ranch, Marshal John Hawkins (Robert McKenzie) posts a notice that the ranch will soon be auctioned off. After selling her cattle to raise the necessary money for the taxes, Dolores plans to breed horses, using a wild stallion named El Diablo to start a good bloodline. One of her neighboring ranchers, Matt Ford (LeRoy Mason), watches as Dolores' men try to break the stallion. Ford, who has been breeding thoroughbreds, expects to sell his horses to Pony Express horse buyer Caldwell (Raymond Brown). He offers to loan Dolores money if her cattle money does not arrive in time. She doesn't know that it was Ford who sent his henchmen, Slim and Butch, to steal her money from the Pony Express rider so she would be forced to marry him and he could gain control of her ranch. After breaking free, El Diablo bolts into the desert, where the lariat around his neck gets caught in some rocks. Gene comes across the wild stallion and frees him. The next day he is able to break the stallion to the saddle and rides him to the Vista Grande ranch, where he tells Dolores and Caldwell about the robbery. Knowing the thieves must have had knowledge of the money in those saddlebags, Gene grows suspicious of Ford. He asks Caldwell to be relieved of duty while he searches for the culprit. Ford orders Slim and Butch to kill Gene, but their attempt to shoot him fails. Gene tells Dolores that they can raise the money she needs by breaking her wild mustangs and selling them to Caldwell. Gene sends El Diablo back to the herd to help control it, and while the horse fights with a pinto for leadership of the herd, Gene rushes to Ford's house and prevents him from signing a contract with Caldwell. Ford agrees to race twenty of his horses against twenty of Gene's horses, with the winner getting the contract. During the next few days, Gene and his men spend long hours breaking and training the wild mustangs. One night, Ford's men free the horses from their corral, leaving only El Diablo and four other horses. Ford also captures the pinto (El Diablo's nemesis) and paints it to resemble a thoroughbred. Undaunted by the loss of his horses, Gene still enters the race with El Diablo. As the race begins, Ford's men quickly cheat their way into first place. Ford is in the lead and switches to the painted pinto during the final stretch. Angered by the presence of his pinto rival, El Diablo catches up and carries Gene to victory. After the race, Gene exposes Ford's trick, and Frog reveals that he found Butch on the trail with Dolores' money. After Butch confesses that Ford was behind the scheme, the men are taken away. Sometime later, riders at the Pony Express station sing a song to congratulate Gene and Dolores on their recent marriage.

It centres on YouTube‚Äîand other social media‚Äîvideos in which those filmed give their views on why they support marriage for same-sex individuals, with each video finishing with the tagline \\"And that's why I'm out for marriage. Are you?\\". Creators of the videos have included members of the public, Members of Parliament, peers and celebrities. Its goal is to raise awareness about the issue of equal marriage and to provide a voice for the people who support it. Out4Marriage is modelled on the It Gets Better YouTube project, launched by US LGBT activist Dan Savage, where politicians, celebrities and members of the public gave hope to teenagers coming to terms with their sexuality. Campaign background and history The British Government's consultation on equal marriage was started on 15 March 2012, prompting the launch of a Christian campaign group called the Coalition for Marriage (C4M). The website for C4M states that they are \\"an umbrella group of individuals and organisations in the UK that support traditional marriage and oppose any plans to redefine it.\\". As part of the British Government's consultations on the introduction of same-sex marriage in the UK, Out4Marriage's Directors of Campaigns James-J Walsh assisted by Joseph Musgrove, a volunteer who went on to work for the Conservative equal marriage campaign wrote the official submission document calling for legislation to allow same-sex religious marriage, enhanced spousal pension rights, and courtesy titles for peers. The Out4Marriage website states that the campaign was conceived by Buonaiuto and Pink News founder, Benjamin Cohen, however since the initial video Buonaiuto moved away to other projects. The website also posits that a ‚Äúglobal team of volunteers are helping to recruit new video makers, moderate submissions and engage with politicians‚Äù. In the first week, the Out4Marriage campaign received considerable press coverage. Home coming Prior to the Out4Marriage campaign launching, a short-film was created called Homecoming, depicting the proposal of a gay soldier to his partner, upon returning home from war. The film received 700,000 YouTube views in its first week online. In a BBC World News interview on 11 May 2012, Buonaiuto explained that Homecoming was what had inspired Out4Marriage. He went on to say that those working on the campaign were all volunteers and that no money had been spent on the project.  LobbyALord  In the run up to the Lords debate in the wake of Lord Dear proposing effectively a deletion amendment, James-J Walsh led on the campaigning activity to engage the House of Lords, he designed the very first platform for being able to digitally engage Peers within the House of Lords. As part of this Walsh recruited Chris Ward, a web developer, to build an online peers lobbying site that enabled ordinary people to connect with often unaccountable Lords and Baronesses. The Site www.LobbyALord.org was receiving traffic resulting at peeks an email being sent to a peer every 8 seconds in the 72 hours before the debate, after endorsements by Grindr a gay mobile dating app, who issued a message to 1 million of its members, and Stephen Fry via his Twitter account.  Notable contributions  Within the first three weeks after the campaign was launched, videos were uploaded to the Out4Marriage YouTube account from public figures such as Richard Branson, UK pop girl band The Saturdays and human rights campaigner, Peter Tatchell. Many Members of Parliament also recorded videos for the campaign, including the then Home Secretary, Theresa May; Former Equalities minister Lynne Featherstone and former cabinet minister, Jack Straw.

He had become an emperor in his own right, perhaps the only emperor in the dynasty, with his kingdom embracing a good portion of North India and whole of Deccan. He carried his arms to the Narmada in the north and annexed the kingdom of Purika which was being ruled by a king named Sisuka. In any case, he certainly ruled from Bundelkhand in the north (though Dr Mirashi does not accept that he has crossed the Narmada) to the present Andhra Pradesh in the south. The puranas assign him a reign of 60 years. As per V.V. Mirashi, it is unlikely that he made any conquest in Northern Maharashtra, Gujarat or Konkan. But, he may have conquered parts of North Kuntala comprising Kolhapur, Satara and Sholapur districts of Maharashtra. In the east, he may have carried his arms to Dakshina Kosala, Kalinga and Andhra. He was a follower of Vedic religion and performed several Yajnas (sacrifices) which include Agnishtoma, Aptoryama, Ukthya, Shodasin, Atiratra, Vajapeya, Brihaspatisava, Sadyaskra and four Asvamedhas. He heavily donated to the Brahmins during the Vajapeya sacrifice as per the Puranas. He also took up the title of Dharmamaharaja in addition to Samrat. He called himself as Haritiputra. His prime minister Deva was a very pious and learned Brahmin. The Puranas say that Pravarasena I has four sons. He married his son Gautamiputra to a daughter of King Bhavanaga of the powerful Bharashiva family, which might have proved to be helpful. However, Gautamiputra predeceased him and he was succeeded by his grandson Rudrasena I, the son of Gautamiputra. His second son, Sarvasena set up his capital at Vatsagulma (the present day Wasim). Nothing is known about the dynasties set up by the other two sons.Mahajan V.D. (1960, reprint 2007) Ancient India, New Delhi: S.

The bot software may autonomously perform actions such as tweeting, re-tweeting, liking, following, unfollowing, or direct messaging other accounts. The automation of Twitter accounts is governed by a set of automation rules that outline proper and improper uses of automation. Proper usage includes broadcasting helpful information, automatically generating interesting or creative content, and automatically replying to users via direct message. Improper usage includes circumventing API rate limits, violating user privacy, spamming, and sockpuppeting. Features It is sometimes desirable to identify when a Twitter account is controlled by a bot. In a 2012 paper, Chu et al. propose the following criteria that indicate that an account may be a bot (they were designing an automated system): * \\"Periodic and regular timing\\" of tweets; * Whether the tweet content contains known spam; and * The ratio of tweets from mobile versus desktop, as compared to an average human Twitter user. Research shows that humans can view Twitter bots as a credible source of information. Examples There are many different types of Twitter bots and their purposes vary from one to another. Some bots may tweet helpful material such as @EarthquakesSF (description below). In 2009, Twitter bots were estimated to create approximately 24% of tweets on Twitter. Here are examples of some of the Twitter bots and how they interact with users on Twitter. * @HaiQuBot tweets short found poems, every 30 minutes, about the world under Covid-19 quarantine. * @Zeitansage (German for speaking clock) tweeted the current time in 2009 and 2010 for about 330.000 times, every minute. * @Betelgeuse_3 sends at-replies in response to tweets that include the phrase, \\"Beetlejuice, beetlejuice, beetlejuice\\". The tweets are sent in the voice of the lead character from the Beetlejuice film. * @BrEFTA Bot finds tweets which mention EFTA and Brexit and retweets them. * @CongressEdits and @parliamentedits posts whenever someone makes edits to Wikipedia from the US Congress and UK Parliament IP addresses, respectively. * @DBZNappa replied with \\"WHAT!? NINE THOUSAND?\\" to anyone on Twitter that used the internet meme phrase \\"over 9000\\". The account began in 2011, and was eventually suspended in 2015, most likely a victim of its own success. * @DearAssistant sends auto-reply tweets responding to complex queries in simple English by utilizing Wolfram Alpha. * @DeepDrumpf is a recurrent neural network, created at MIT, that releases tweets imitating Donald Trump's speech patterns. It received its namesake from the term 'Donald Drumpf', popularized in the segment 'Donald Trump' from the show Last Week Tonight with John Oliver. * @DroptheIBot tweets the message, \\"People aren't illegal. Try saying 'undocumented immigrant' or 'unauthorized immigrant' instead\\" to Twitter users who have sent a tweet containing the phrase \\"illegal immigrant\\". It was created by American Fusion.net journalists Jorge Rivas and Patrick Hogan. * @everyword has tweeted every word of the English language. It started in 2007 and tweeted every thirty minutes until 2014. * @chssbot tweets historical chess matches every 4 hours. * @factbot1 was created by Eric Drass to illustrate what he believed to be a prevalent problem: that of people on the internet believing unsupported facts which accompany pictures. * @fuckeveryword * @Horse_ebooks was a bot that gained a following among people who found its tweets poetic. It has inspired various _ebooks-suffixed Twitter bots which use Markov text generators (or similar techniques) to create new tweets by mashing up the tweets of their owner. It went inactive following a brief promotion for Bear Stearns Bravo. * @infinite_scream tweets and auto- replies a 2-39 character scream. At least partially inspired by Edvard Munch's The Scream, it attracted attention from those distressed by the Presidency of Donald Trump and bad news. * @MetaphorMagnet is an AI bot that generates metaphorical insights using its knowledge-base of stereotypical properties and norms. A companion bot @MetaphorMirror pairs these metaphors to news tweets. Another companion bot @BestOfBotWorlds uses metaphor to generate faux- religious insights. * @Pentametron finds tweets incidentally written in iambic pentameter using the CMU Pronouncing Dictionary, pairs them into couplets using a rhyming dictionary, and retweets them as couplets into followers' feeds. * @RedScareBot tweets in the persona of Joseph McCarthy in response to Twitter posts mentioning \\"socialist\\", \\"communist\\", or \\"communism\\". * @tinycarebot promotes simple self care actions to its followers, such as remembering to look up from your screens, taking a break to go outside, and drink more water. It will also send a self care suggestion if you tweet directly at it. There are also families of related Twitter bots. For example, @LessicoFeed, @SpracheFeed, @SwedishFeed, @TraductionFeed, @VocabularioFeed, @WelshFeed each tweet an English word along with a translation every hour into Italian, German, Swedish, French, Spanish, and Welsh, respectively. The translations are crowdsourced by volunteers and subscribers.  Impact  Detecting non-human Twitter users has been of interest to academics. Indiana University has developed a free service called Botometer (formerly BotOrNot), which scores Twitter handles based on their likelihood of being a Twitterbot. One significant academic study estimated that up to 15% of Twitter users were automated bot accounts. The prevalence of Twitter bots coupled with the ability of some bots to give seemingly human responses has enabled these non- human accounts to garner widespread influence. Political A subset of Twitter bots programmed to complete social tasks played an important role in the United States 2016 Presidential Election. Researchers estimated that pro- Trump bots generated four tweets for every pro-Clinton automated account and out-tweeted pro-Clinton bots 7:1 on relevant hashtags during the final debate. Deceiving Twitter bots fooled candidates and campaign staffers into retweeting misappropriated quotes and accounts affiliated with incendiary ideals.http://politicalbots.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Data-Memo-Third- Presidential-Debate.pdf Concerns about political Twitter bots include the promulgation of malicious content, increased polarization, and the spreading of fake news. Many operate as of 2019, with most pro-Trump bots originating from Russia, Iran, and Myanmar. Twitter bots have also been documented to influence online politics in Venezuela. Positive influence Many non- malicious bots are popular for their entertainment value. However, as technology and the creativity of bot-makers improves, so does the potential for Twitter bots that fill social needs. @tinycarebot is a Twitterbot that encourages followers to practice self care, and brands are increasingly using automated Twitter bots to engage with customers in interactive ways. One anti- bullying organization has created @TheNiceBot, which attempts to combat the prevalence of mean tweets by automatically tweeting kind messages. Public figures The majority of Twitter accounts following public figures and brands are often fake or inactive, making the number of Twitter followers a celebrity has a difficult metric for gauging popularity. While this cannot always be helped, some public figures who have gained or lost huge quantities of followers in short periods of time have been accused of discreetly paying for Twitter followers. For example, the Twitter accounts of Sean Combs, Rep Jared Polis (D-Colo), PepsiCo, Mercedes-Benz, and 50 Cent have come under scrutiny for possibly engaging in the buying and selling of Twitter followers, which is estimated to be between a $40 million and $360 million business annually. Account sellers may charge a premium for more realistic accounts that have Twitter profile pictures and bios and retweet the accounts they follow. In addition to an ego boost, public figures may gain more lucrative endorsement contracts from inflated Twitter metrics. For brands, however, the translation of online buzz and social media followers into sales has recently come under question after The Coca-Cola Company disclosed that a corporate study revealed that social media buzz does not create a spike in short term sales.

Signs and symptoms Signs of hyperestrogenism may include heightened levels of one or more of the estrogen sex hormones (usually estradiol and/or estrone), lowered levels of follicle-stimulating hormone and/or luteinizing hormone (due to suppression of the hypothalamic‚Äìpituitary‚Äìgonadal axis by estrogen), and lowered levels of androgens such as testosterone (generally only relevant to males). Symptoms of the condition in women may consist of menstrual irregularities, amenorrhea, abnormal vaginal bleeding, and enlargement of the uterus and breasts. It may also present as isosexual precocity in children and as hypogonadism, gynecomastia, feminization, impotence, and loss of libido in males. If left untreated, hyperestrogenism may increase the risk of estrogen-sensitive cancers such as breast cancer later in life. Causes Hyperestrogenism can be caused by ovarian tumors, genetic conditions such as aromatase excess syndrome (also known as familial hyperestrogenism), or overconsumption of exogenous sources of estrogen, including medications used in hormone replacement therapy and hormonal contraception. Liver cirrhosis is another cause, though through lowered metabolism of estrogen, not oversecretion or overconsumption like the aforementioned. It's necessary to know there exist two kinds of hyperestrogenism: Absolute (more concentration than usual of estrogen) and relative (we can have a normal concentration of estrogen, but it's higher with respect to progesterone). An example of absolute hyperestrogenism could be: persistent follicles that later undergo atresia without ovulating; and the example of relative hyperestrogenism: luteal insufficiency. DiagnosisTreatments Treatment may consist of surgery in the case of tumors, lower doses of estrogen in the case of exogenously-mediated estrogen excess, and estrogen-suppressing medications like gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues and progestogens. In addition, androgens may be supplemented in the case of males.

His subjects included show business and sports stars, and politicians. Life and work Steen was born in London, one of two children (his sister Sheila was born in 1932). Much of his childhood was spent in the air-raid shelters of London and, also as a result of dyslexia, he was poorly schooled. Steen recalls the beginning of his career: > One day a woman called Paddy Brosnan went to Smithfields to buy some meat. > My dad asked Paddy if there was a job for me. She was the secretary to Tom > Hopkinson, the editor of Picture Post. She said I could work for her as an > office boy. On 1 April 1951, at the age of 15, I started work. Picture Post > carried staff writers and about eight staff photographers. I walked around > the office delivering post and doing odd errands for the staff. One day I > was in the photographers' rest room, where they had their lockers, when the > picture editor Harry Deverson, came in. He said to one photographer, 'Come > and talk to me about a job in Switzerland,' and to another photographer, > 'Talk to me about a job in Tokyo'. I had rarely left Clerkenwell, certainly > never been abroad. My ears started buzzing, and it was at that precise > moment I decided that this photography game was for me. I soon started > assisting the photographers.Heroes+Villains (Genesis Publications, 2005) One of those photographers, Bert Hardy, took Steen under his wing. Hardy taught him not just about taking photos but also the importance of punctuality, being smart, wearing clean shoes and, above all, the love of the job. Between the ages of 15 and 18, when Steen's friends were going out to pubs and parties, he was out and about, with a borrowed camera taking pictures around London by day and by night. On sunny days mothers would leave their babies in prams outside their homes and, to earn extra money, Steen would borrow a camera, photograph the babies, and have the pictures printed at a chemist shop. He would pay a shilling a print and then knock at the door of the mother and sell her a photo of her baby for two shillings. At the age of 17, he was doing small assignments, and at 18 he undertook his first foreign assignment, travelling to Paris to photograph the film director Otto Preminger. \\"I stayed at the Georges VI hotel, dined at Maxim's, and went to the Crazy Horse nightclub. This was the beginning of a great adventure that would last for decades.\\" In June 1954, Steen began his National Service, spending the first few months in Germany as an Army photographer. He was then despatched to Egypt where he was promoted to the rank of sergeant. \\"My mum and dad were very proud.\\" From his base in Ismialia, Egypt, he was sent by the War Office to cover many stories in the Middle East; Cyprus, Libya, Aden and Somalia. By the time he was demobbed (in June 1956) Steen had accomplished an immense amount of travel and photography. He returned to Picture Post, but a year later the magazine ceased publication. Soon afterwards, he was offered a job as a photographer on Britain's first newspaper for women, Women's Sunday Mirror. The publication was founded by Hugh Cudlipp, who gave Steen an assignment to photograph a woman delivering her own baby under hypnosis. > The pictures were amazing; the mother and her husband and me with a > Rolleiflex in a small bedroom in north London. I entered a sequence of nine > photos in the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Press Photographs of the Year Awards. > I won first prize. I was 21, the youngest photographer to win. He joined the Daily Mail as a feature photographer during 1959‚Äì1960 before going freelance. He began to work for Queen magazine in 1962, and soon afterwards such publications as The Sunday Times, Daily Telegraph and Nova. Steen's website biography describes him as having been \\"trained on the maxim 'every picture tells a story'\\". He focused on photographing film stars, actors, criminals, politicians, prime ministers and many men, women and children going about their everyday lives. His book, Heroes and Villains (Genesis Publications, 2005), contains 100 photographs of famous and infamous men who were photographed by Steen over the years and was also the subject of an exhibition. Lucy Hughes-Hallett wrote for The Spectator about the book: > This isn't a pantheon of heroes, but it is a celebration of manly beauty > [although Steen proves] that you don't need to be a beauty to make a > beautiful picture. But it is also, to anyone who was alive in Britain in > 1963, intensely evocative of that lost world. Steen is a pro ‚Äì technically > accomplished and unpretentious. There aren't really any heroes in this book: > Steen is palpably too perceptive and level-headed for hero-worship. But > there are 100 fine photographs, intensely redolent of the period that > produced them, and still looking good some 40 years on. Steen was the father of the author and journalist James Steen.

This album is the artist's first release under Epic Records, since publicly asking the now-defunct Jive Records to release her from her contractual obligations. The singer cited a lack of label support and financial funding for her previous albums Fantasy Ride (2009) and Basic Instinct (2010). On this fifth studio album, Ciara is reunited with her long- term mentor and friend L.A. Reid, chairman of Epic Records. Reid is credited with discovering Ciara in 2003 along with signing her to his LaFace Records label and executive-producing her debut studio album, Goodies (2004). On Ciara, the singer is reunited with music producers Rodney Jerkins and Jasper Cameron, who have respectively worked on previous Ciara singles and albums. The duo were joined by The Underdogs, Soundz, D'Mile, Oligee, Josh Abraham and Mike Will Made It, amongst others. Writing contributions come from the likes of singer-songwriters: Wynter Gordon, Livvi Franc and Ali Tamposi, along with a number of contributions from Ciara herself. Rappers Future and Nicki Minaj respectively have guest vocals on the album, whilst Ciara herself is listed as a featured artist on the song \\"Super Turnt Up\\", a record where she raps and takes credit for co-producing the song. Promoting the release of this album, all three singles; including \\"Sweat\\" featuring 2 Chainz, \\"Sorry\\", and \\"Got Me Good\\" were released, when the album was titled One Woman Army. None of the songs impacted on the US Billboard Hot 100 and were subsequently swept aside in favor of a new single, titled \\"Body Party\\", which reached at number 22 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and number eight on the US Billboard Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs chart. \\"I'm Out\\" featuring Nicki Minaj, was released as the album's second single in June 2013. \\"Overdose\\" was released as the album's third single, it was serviced to American Urban and Rhythmic radio in September and October 2013, respectively. Upon its release, Ciara was met with a warm reception from music critics, who complimented the album as one of the strongest in her discography, but criticized the lack of identity and lasting impression that the album makes. The album debuted at number two on the US Billboard 200 chart, with first-week sales of 59,000 copies, becoming her fourth top three album on the chart. As of April 2015, the album has sold 208,000 copies in the United States.  Background  Following her departure from Jive Records, Ciara signed a new record deal with the president of Epic Records, L.A. Reid. Under LaFace Records (and later Jive Records), Ciara released her 3√ó platinum-certified debut album Goodies (2004) and its follow- up, the platinum-certified Ciara: The Evolution (2006). Album three, Fantasy Ride (2009), was plagued with issues which resulted in Ciara changing management part way through the album's production and dropping the idea of a 3-disc concept album. Additionally many of the records leaked online prior to the album's release; as a result, Basic Instinct (2010) was recorded in strict confidentiality. Basic Instinct sold just 37,000 copies in its first week in the United States, and became Ciara's first album to miss the top-three on the Billboard 200. At the time, Ciara said that she wasn't interested in first week sales or the album's commercial performance, but rather in building her brand as an artist. According to the Los Angeles Times Gerrick Kennedy, the lack of commercial success with Basic Instinct was attributable to multiple pushbacks, and the leaking of material from the album's recording sessions. In February 2011, Ciara revealed that her relationship with her record label was not on positive terms; Jive had not properly financial supported Fantasy Ride or Basic Instinct. Ciara self-funded some of the albums promotions, including her last single \\"Gimmie Dat\\" and in the end wrote a public letter asking to be released from her record obligations. Several months later in July of the same year, it was revealed that Ciara would be reuniting with L.A. Reid by signing to his Epic Records label. Reid had previously signed Ciara to LaFace at the start of her career, and played a role in executively producing her debut album Goodies (2004). Billboard magazine officially confirmed Ciara's signing to Epic in September 2011. During an interview with Sway in the Morning in February 2012, Ciara revealed that she would be taking her time recording her fifth studio album. In June 2012, Ciara spoke about the album saying \\"It really is just me pouring my heart into the record, and I think my fans deserve that. I really had to be in a comfortable place, and I really am and I'm excited about it, that's the beauty of music. Music is like really being able to express yourself. I wanted to make sure that I expressed myself in the best way that I could, and I let the music also be a healing process for me at points. There's a lot of happy moments as well, so that's what it's about. That's music. You laugh, you cry, you dance, you love, you hurt, you feel all kinds of things. That's the beauty of music.\\"  Writing, production and collaborations  Livvi Franc was originally contracted to co-write the album. She co-wrote \\"Read My Lips\\" and \\"Overdose\\" which appear on the album. \\"One Woman Army\\" originally written for this album by Franc was included on Ciara's next album Jackie (2015). On her fifth album, Ciara contributed to both the writing and production of the album's songs. She wrote \\"Sweat\\" (featuring 2 Chainz), a song that was originally supposed to be the album's first single when the album was called One Woman Army. Ciara also co-wrote and co-produced \\"Sorry\\", the song that was chosen to supersede \\"Sweat\\" as one of One Woman Armys two lead singles, along with \\"Got Me Good\\", also written by Ciara. None of these records made the final album. \\"Sorry\\" was co-written and co-produced by Jasper Cameron, who previously worked with Ciara on her 2006 single \\"Promise\\" and 2009 single \\"Never Ever\\". Together the duo wrote and produced \\"Super Turnt Up\\" which did make the final listing for Ciara. \\"Got Me Good\\" was co-written with Rodney Jerkins and Livvi Franc (Olivia Waith). When interviewed by Rap-Up TV, Jerkins said \\"I had a meeting with her about what her future holds and I told her I was there if she ever needed my creative juices, so hopefully me and her get in the studio and work.\\" Jerkins previously produced records for Ciara: The Evolution and Fantasy Ride. Waithe meanwhile, was originally enlisted to write the majority of the album's songs along with songwriter and vocal coach Ali Tamposi; in an interview about the project, Tamposi said \\"it's been really cool and laid back so that's been fun. There's a lot of angst and edge in Ciara's music and we've tried to be really conceptual and write things that haven't been done before and real strong women empowerment songs.\\" Along with The Underdogs (Harvey Mason and Damon Thomas), the duo wrote the album's original title track \\"One Woman Army\\". They also contributed at least one other song, \\"Washaway\\", though neither song appears on the final album following the change of album titles. \\"Washaway\\" and another song called \\"Running\\" were amongst several songs previewed by the media which didn't make the album. It was the first time in her career that Ciara had collaborated with The Underdogs. Not all of the Waithe and Tamposi collaborations went to waste, \\"Read My Lips\\" (written by Harris, Waithe and Jerkins) and \\"Overdose\\" (written by Waithe, Tamposi, Oliver Goldstein and Josh Abraham) both made the album. Minaj features on \\"I'm Out\\" and \\"Living it Up\\"; Ciara previously featured on Minaj's song \\"I'm Legit\\" from Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded ‚Äì The Re-Up. Ciara also worked with Bangladesh, Hit-Boy, Soundz and Jermaine Dupri. Hit-Boy produced a record written by Soundz named after himself, which he described as \\"energetic, for the club, for the radio.\\" However, while Ciara recorded the full song, months went by after its production with no response. Thus, he gave the beat to Kendrick Lamar, and it became his single, \\"Backseat Freestyle\\" (2013). Whilst that record did not appear on the album, \\"Sophomore\\" produced by Soundz and \\"DUI\\" co-produced by Soundz and The Rockstarz both made the album. Soundz previously produced records for Basic Instinct. Another of Ciara's frequent collaborators, Tricky Stewart, also worked on the album. On July 22, 2012, it was revealed that singer-songwriter Wynter Gordon had written a song for Ciara. Speaking about the song, Gordon said, \\"It's pop. She sounds really good. She's singing like I've never actually heard Ciara sound... I'm very proud of her vocal ability on this record.\\" The song titled \\"Livin' It Up\\" was produced by Jerkins' close friend and musical associate D'Mile. After collaborating with American rapper Nicki Minaj on the song \\"I'm Legit\\" for Minaj's album Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded - The Re-Up, Minaj agreed to appear on Ciara's album in return. Originally, the duo had worked on just one collaboration for Ciara called \\"I'm Out\\". Speaking about Minaj's version on the song, Ciara said \\"The energy of the record is so dope, and it's really for the ladies, and Nicki she just killed the verse. She literally murdered it, like she got that throw-back, that thing that she does that's so special. She went in.\\" Having enjoyed the process Minaj said \\"I was supposed to only do one song for her album and I think I'm going to end up doing two. I just love what she's doing and I'm so proud and I'm really excited for people to hear it.\\" In April, Ciara confirmed that Minaj was finished with a second record for the album; in an interview with MTV News, Ciara said, \\"She's actually finishing up one now that's really it's a monster too. The moments that we have had so far have just been crazy. It's just been magical, it's been something special and I feel like the fans have always wanted to see she and I rock together.\\" In the end, Minaj also recorded vocals for the aforementioned \\"Livin' It Up\\". On June 23, 2013, rapper, Future confirmed that the track, \\"Where You Go\\", was originally recorded for his second studio album, Future Hendrix (2013); however, he gave it to Ciara, stating, \\"She's like, 'I need this song. It just seems like it was just speaking to me. Give it to me, give it to me.' I was like, 'Man cool, you can have it.\\"  Concept  Ciara's fifth album was originally called One Woman Army after a song of the same name produced by The Underdogs. Speaking on the concept Ciara said \\"It really is the best way to represent what the body of work is, On One Woman Army, I talk about where I am and the things that I want as a woman and the things that I need.\\" However, on April 15, 2013, Ciara confirmed the album's track listing and simultaneously revealed that her fifth album was now eponymously titled. According to Spin, the self- titled incarnation of Ciara's fifth studio album is \\"more inventive enough to separate itself from her previous work\\" compared to the album's previous direction, under the title One Woman Army. During a press release, Epic Records described the album as a deeply personal record; speaking about the concept and themes on the album, Ciara said \\"I can sometimes be afraid of my own vulnerability, but this time I let myself face it. I let myself feel. I let myself be real. I let myself hurt and be healed.\\" Spin and Idolator described the album as an updated version of crunk&B;, a sound that Ciara was familiar with in 2004, and contained my pop moments. Ciara explained the influence behind the album's theme saying,  Release and artwork  On June 4, 2012, Ciara began the album campaign for One Woman Army with the premiere of \\"Sweat\\", featuring American rapper 2 Chainz. It was released to rhythmic contemporary radio stations in the United States on June 18, 2012. It was initially intended to serve as the album's lead single; Upon charting at eighty-six on the US Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs chart, it was demoted to promotional single status. On September 11, 2012, Epic Records informed fans via Twitter that they could expect Ciara's fifth album in Winter 2012. A new lead single, \\"Sorry\\", was confirmed and released on September 25, 2012. It impacted on rhythmic radio stations on October 9, 2012. The song's music video premiered on September 13, 2012. The single was well received by music critics, who compared it to Ciara's previous single, \\"Promise\\". \\"Sorry\\" underperformed commercially, as it only reached forty-two on the US Billboard Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs chart while charting at twenty-two on the Billboard Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart. \\"Got Me Good\\" was released as the second single via digital download on November 6, 2012. The single impacted US Rhythmic radio on November 13, 2012 and mainstream radio on December 4, 2012. The song's accompanying music video, which was directed by Joseph Kahn, premiered on the Sony JumboTron in Times Square in New York City on October 25, 2012. The video features the all-girl dance crew 8 Flavahz, who placed 2nd on the seventh season of MTV's America's Best Dance Crew. Although the song was well received by critics, who praised its electronic fast-paced rhythms and called it \\"dance food-ready\\", it failed to chart. That same month, Ciara said that there was no release date for the album. She instead said \\"I think I'm almost done. I think there was a date December 4 that was supposedly put in the universe, but the date was never ever confirmed, not from my mouth, but they can definitely look out for this album this winter. I'll be telling you soon. Stay tuned. You know what? I'm giving you guys my video [for \\"Got Me Good\\"] on my birthday, so you never know what could happen around Christmas- time. I love giving gifts.\\" After the premiere of the \\"Got Me Good\\" video, the album was slated to drop in early 2013. On April 15, 2013, Ciara revealed the official tracklist for the album and confirmed that it is now titled Ciara. Additionally, she stated that it would be released on June 4, 2013. The album was then postponed to July 9, 2013. The aforementioned singles were swept aside from the album and subsequently under the title Ciara, the album is now led by the single \\"Body Party\\". The album artwork features a mirror-flipped image of Ciara.  Music and lyrics  Following the album listening party, Spin described the album as having no ballads except \\"Body Party\\" whilst John Kennedy, writing for Vibe, described the album as \\"feel-good midtempo\\" songs akin to Ciara's Goodies era (circa 2004).Kennedy, John. (April 26, 2013). Vibe. (Intermedia Vibe Holdings). Retrieved. 2013-04-28. * Ciara Sticks to Her Natural Range (Page 2 of 5) * Her Confidence is 100,000 Trillion (Page 3 of 5) * \\"D.U.I.\\" Is Some Serious Songwriting (Page 4 of 5) * \\"Body Party\\" is the Best Slow Jam Since \\"Promise\\" (Page 5 of 5) In an interview with MTV News Ciara said that creating her fifth album was the most personal experience of her career thus far. She elaborated that she had asked close friend and collaborator Missy Elliott to review her early progress on Ciara, \\"I always share my projects with her early. I'll go to her house and play her the records really early in the process, and it's always so cool, but I just have to pinch myself in moments when I see her a lot. I'll be like, 'OK, this is really my friend,' but it's dope because I really respect her. She's done something in music that no one has done and when you look at her old references and just her references period, you wonder what the mind of that person is, and she's my friend, so I get to get a little bit more out of that mind, and it's really cool.\\" The album opens with \\"I'm Out\\", a \\"crystalline\\" rhythmic pop ladies' anthem, which features American rapper Nicki Minaj. Its melody is backed by \\"clattering percussion\\". It was written by Timothy and Theron Thomas (Planet VI), who also wrote track number four, \\"Keep On Looking\\". Other pop songs on the album include the Wynter Gordon-penned \\"Livin' It Up\\", which was described by Billboard as a \\"feel-good track\\" that \\"infuses island flavors.\\" It samples elements of the bridge from rap duo Kid 'n Play's 1988 song \\"Rolling with Kid 'n Play\\". According to Idolator, it also contains Euro influences. \\"Overdose\\" is also a pop song, though this time utilising an electropop production and electronic dance music (EDM) beat, that was described by Idolator as the \\"most straightforward pop track that Ciara has ever cut\\". The Rodney Jerkins-produced \\"Read My Lips\\" features a 1980s-inspired synthpop production with a sing-along chorus, whilst \\"Sophomore\\" is \\"sexy-but-aggressive [and] grown-as-fuck.\\" On \\"Sophomore\\", Ciara educates her partner on \\"sex education\\", with lyrics such as \\"So soft, my skin/ So soft, my booty/ So soft, my bed/ So soft, I got 'em sayin'/ Give me more\\". The song was originally leaked by DJ Orator in September 2012. It was produced by Soundz, who also co-produced \\"DUI\\" with The Rockstars. The album's lead single \\"Body Party\\" is the album's only ballad, it was co-written by Ciara's boyfriend Future and features a sample of Ghost Town DJ's 1996 single \\"My Boo\\".  Promotion  Promotion for Ciara's fifth album (then titled One Woman Army) began on June 2, 2012 when Ciara released several promotional pictures. Several days later, Ciara previewed songs at an album listening party for industry executives and a variety of internet bloggers in New York City. Amongst the songs played were collaborations with Rick Ross and Nicki Minaj. Ciara would later confirm that it was not Minaj's, but her own vocals, that reviewers has heard at the listening party [on \\"Super Turnt Up\\"]. Many positive reviews came from the listening party. Patrik Sandberg of V Magazine said it was the \\"Hardest @ciara record I've heard. She's reconstructing the lanes. So future.\\" \\"This album is ridiculous. It's coming for everything!\\" The Ross collaboration made the album as a bonus track exclusively at Target.com and for the Japanese release. On August 20, 2012, Epic Records sent an exclusive playlist of songs to Cosmopolitan magazine which contained the album's ninth track, \\"Livin' It Up\\", sans Minaj's vocals. Promotion in 2013 began with Ciara's appearances on BET's 106 & Park on April 23, 2013 and on The Wendy Williams Show on May 8, 2013.

It was sent to US urban contemporary radio on March 18, 2013 and to rhythmic contemporary radio on April 9, 2013. The single was well received by music critics who praised its \\"smooth R&B; beat,\\" while noting it as \\"legitimately clever\\" and comparing it to the work of Prince and R. Kelly. On the week ending April 28, 2013, \\"Body Party\\" debuted at number 35 on the US Billboard Hot 100, becoming Ciara's highest debut on the chart and the highest entry that week; it has since peaked at 22. It also ascended to number eight on the US Billboard Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs chart, becoming her thirteenth top ten hit on that chart; it went on to peak at six The song became Ciara's first Top twenty-five hit on the former chart since her 2009 single \\"Love Sex Magic\\" with Justin Timberlake.

The song's official remix, featuring B.o.B and Future, was released as a digital download in May 2013, and is included on physical editions of the album. \\"I'm Out\\", featuring Nicki Minaj, premiered online on May 22, 2013 and was officially sent to urban radio in the US on June 3, 2013 as the album's second single.

However, in September 2013, Ciara confirmed that plans had changed and that \\"Read My Lips\\" would now be the album's third single as it was her favourite song, and that \\"it seems to be a song that my fans really love too, so we are both on the same page. Me and my fans are insync.\\" Ciara Interview with Q105's Nick Giuliano at 0:55 seconds. The release of \\"Overdose\\" still went ahead; its single cover was unveiled on September 18, 2013. \\"Overdose\\" officially impacted Urban radio stations in the US on September 18, 2013 and a month later, it impacted Rhythmic stations.http://204.12.29.228/musiclibrary_detail.cfm?LabelID=141&ArtistID;=167&AlbumID;=1081&SingleID;=3734&Gospel;=0  Critical reception  Ciara received generally positive reviews from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 72, based on 15 reviews. Writing for The Guardian, Alex Macpherson viewed the album as a high-quality addition to her already \\"formidable discography\\", particularly for its breadth. He also felt that the features from Nicki Minaj were welcome in a time where artists like Rihanna had maligned Ciara's previous work as commercial failures. Mikael Wood of the Los Angeles Times found \\"Keep on Lookin'\\" and \\"I'm Out\\" to be particular highlights, saying the rest of the album had a mellow sound compared to those tracks; he ultimately praised Ciara for not playing it safe, however, seeing her adventurous with both lyrics and production. Allmusic's Andy Kellman praised Ciara's use of producers and writers stating \\"the result isn't a muddled mess but another lean and focused set, despite the involvement of several writers and producers.\\" Pitchfork Media's Tim Finney felt that Ciara improves the songs with her charisma and wrote that her \\"uncomplicated exhilaration raises the straightforward, 2013 carbon dated club-pop of 'Livin' It Up' and 'Overdose' from throwaway to highlight status, their obviousness transformed into a virtue through the singer's palpable enjoyment.\\" In a mixed review, Evan Rytlewski of The A.V. Club found the album to be too dance and R&B-oriented; and felt that it should have explored her \\"airy voice\\", as found on singles like \\"Body Party\\", that recaptured the zeitgeist of her earlier work. At USA Today, Steve Jones said that \\"bass-fueled club bangers and libido-driven ballads tend to hit their mark but ultimately, don't leave a lasting impression.\\" The Boston Globes Ken Capobianco criticized the album for \\"missing a unique lyrical or musical vision\\", further elaborating, \\"we've heard these tropes before,\\" and concluding their review that \\"now deep into her career, the real Ciara still proves elusive.\\" Jon Carmanica of The New York Times found the production \\"vivid\\", but felt that Ciara's voice lacks personality and said that she sounds monotonous throughout the album.  Accolades  Pitchfork Media has named the lead single, \\"Body Party\\", as the fifth best song of 2013. Spin ranked \\"Body Party\\" at number 30 on its \\"50 Best Songs of 2013\\" list and the album at number four on its \\"20 Best R&B; Albums of 2013\\" list. Fact listed the album at number 41 on its \\"50 Best Albums of 2013\\" list. Digital Spy ranked the album number twenty-four of the top albums of 2013. British website Popjustice ranked the album at number 17 on its \\"Top 33 Albums of 2013\\" list. The Village Voice ranked \\"Body Party\\" at number 12 on its \\"25 Best Songs of 2013\\" list.

He has a similar role in GP3 Series since the creation of that category. He is also a consultant for Le Mans organisation. Career=Alpine and Renault years In 1967 he joined Automobiles Alpine, after convincing Jean R√©del√©. R√©del√© commissioned him to organize a motor development department of their own to reduce dependence on those of Gordini, Mignotet and Moteur Moderne. There he began to develop a turbo engine, which would be one of the bases for the future Renault‚Äôs Formula One turbo engine. In 1971, he tuned a R16‚Äôs engine to be mounted on a chassis designed by Andr√© de Cortanze for the French F3 Championship. In 1973, before the merger between Alpine and Renault-Gordini, Jean Terramorsi, Chairman of the second company, sent Dudot to the United States to study the potential of turbo technology in motorsport. There he was finally convinced of the possibilities. Back in France, he went to work at the Renault Sport‚Äôs Viry- Ch√¢tillon factory where he and other developers (Fran√ßois Castaing and Jean- Pierre Boudy) began adapting the CH1 (a two-litre engine for F2 and Sport) to make it a smaller turbo engine. In early 1975, Castaing took a more administrative role and Boudy went to the design office, so Dudot was left in charge of developing an engine for Le Mans and the secret design of the 1.5-litre turbo for Formula One. After some tests, the car fitted with the new and innovative Renault-Gordini EF1 engine, the RS01, debuted at the 1977 British Grand Prix. In 1980, when Castaing was transferred to other activities within Renault and left Renault Sport, Dudot was appointed Technical Director. In 1986, he led the design of the EF15B power plant, which included for the first time in Formula One the pneumatic valve return, an innovation that would have a major impact on the era of atmospheric engines. At the end of that year, Renault ceased its turbo programme. Soon after, Patrick Faure entrusted to him to design a naturally aspirated engine in view of the regulations that would take effect from 1989. He devised a 3.5-litre V10 that was revolutionary at a time when other manufacturers were betting on the V8 and V12. Prost Grand Prix, USA interlude and return to Renault At the end of 1997 Renault left Formula One and Dudot was hired as Prost Grand Prix‚Äôs Technical Director, but in June 1999 he was replaced by Alan Jenkins. In 2001, he joined Nissan‚Äôs Infiniti engine programme in the Indy Racing League as Project Manager.

Family  left His father was Giacomo Muzio Attendolo, who had three marriages and sixteen children: one child with his first wife Antonia Salimbeni, three children with his second wife Caterina Alopo; two children (including Carlo) with his third wife Maria Marzani countess of Celano; and ten children with his mistresses Tamira di Cagli and Lucia Terzani da Marsciano. Muzio Attendolo earned the nickname Sforza (\\"Strong\\") on the battlefield, which became the family surname under his son Francesco I Sforza , who was the Duke of Milan from 1450 to 1466. Francesco I Sforza had as sibling Carlo, who took the religious name of Gabriele.  Biography  Carlo, born on 15 June 1423, spent the early part of his life serving in the military, but soon grew tired of the secular life. He preferred studying the scriptures to fighting on the battlefield. On 18 January 1442 he entered the Augustinian Monastery of San Salvatore di Selva di Lago located outside Siena. He received the sacrament of Holy Orders under Girolamo Buonsignori, the Prior of the Monastery, and took the name Gabriele di Cotignola or Gabriele Sforza as he is now known. At the Monastery he dedicated himself to his studies and wrote various religious epistles, orations, moral treatises, essays on the gospels and four books on Scholastic Theology. His achievements did not go unnoticed, and he was soon appointed to serve as a religious teacher at the Monastery. His brother Francesco later obtained for him by Pope Nicholas V the appointment, on 20 June 1545, as Archbishop of Milan. Gabriele accepted unwillingly, and was consecrated bishop in the church of Santa Maria Incoronata on 28 July 1454 by Giovanni Castiglione bishop of Pavia. In 1456 the Archbishop began paying pastoral visits to the parishes of the Archdiocese of Milan. In order to respond to the needs of his people, he urged his brother Francesco to build the Ospedale Maggiore, one of the first community hospitals in Europe. Gabriele Sforza died on 12 September 1457 in Milan and was buried in the church of Santa Maria Incoronata, Milan, which his brother had commissioned. His funerary monument was created by Francesco Solari. Because of his dedication to faith, Gabriele Sforza was sometime later considered as blessed, even if he had no liturgical memory.

Since 1988, it has been housed in \\"EL-DE Haus,\\" the EL-DE building, named for the initials of its owner, Catholic businessman Leopold Dahmen. This building was the headquarters of the Cologne Gestapo (secret police) between December 1935 and March 1945. In the final months of the war, several hundred people, most of them foreign forced laborers, were murdered in the courtyard of the building. In a bit of historical irony, the EL-DE building remained largely untouched by the ravages of the war. The NS Documentation Centre (NS-DOC) is dedicated to memorializing the victims of the Nazi regime, as well as research and teaching about Cologne's history during the Nazi era. The former Gestapo prison was inaugurated as a memorial site on December 4, 1981. Some 1,800 inscriptions and drawings done by prisoners have survived on the walls of the ten cells. The Gestapo prison memorial site is one of the best preserved prisons from the Nazi era, representing an historical asset of national and European importance. Since June, 1997, the permanent exhibition in the EL-DE building has depicted political, social and community life in \\"Cologne During the Nazi Era.\\" That includes the seizure of power and the power apparatus, propaganda and the \\"national community,\\" everyday life, youth culture, religion, racism, the genocide of Cologne's Jews and its Sinti and Roma, and opposition, resistance, war and society during war. In addition, temporary exhibitions depict local and national aspects of the Nazi regime. The center also mounts more than 130 events each year. The museum's educational department and the Information and Education Centre against Right-wing Extremism (ibs) also run educational and teaching programs. The NS Documentation Centre views itself as an important research locus. This is supported by the library, with literature on Cologne under the Nazis, general Nazi history and right-wing extremism. It is also the task of the documentation department, with its extensive collections of photographs, posters, artifacts, documents and witness statements, which are organized into databases and made accessible. Numerous research projects deal with, among other subjects, Jewish history, contemporary witness statements and interviews, forced labor, the police, youth culture, the press, clubs and organizations, various victim groups and commemorative activities, such as the Cologne artist Gunter Demnig's project \\"Stolpersteine\\" (Stumbling Blocks). Among the large, ongoing research undertakings are the history of the Holocaust, resistance, the Gestapo, the Nazi system of Gauleiter (district overseers), urban planning, public health policies and the Hitler Youth movement. The results of the research projects are published in a series of writings in book form, a workbook series, a series put out by the Information and Education Association, and the center's Internet page. The NS Documentation Center is a municipal institution and, since 2008, part of Cologne's city museums associations. So within the municipal administration, it is responsible for dealing with all subjects related to the city's Nazi past, including the visitor programs for former forced labourers, which the city has been running since 1989. The center has been the recipient of numerous awards, including the \\"special recommendation\\" of the 2000 Museum of the Year Award.  Awards The NS Documentation Center of the City of Cologne has been awarded several times: * European Museum of the Year Award 2000 (special appreciation) * Cologne architecture prize () 2001 * Architecture prize North-Rhine Westphalia () 2001 * Invitation to the Congress in Dubrovnik: \\"The Best in Heritage.

It is the first general-knowledge encyclopedia in Uzbek. The Uzbek Soviet Encyclopedia was printed in the Cyrillic script. Although the encyclopedia contained some articles translated from the Russian-language Great Soviet Encyclopedia, its coverage of topics skewed towards Uzbek interests.  History  The Uzbek Soviet Encyclopedia was published in Tashkent from 1971 to 1980 by the Uzbek Soviet Encyclopedia Publishing House. Doctor Ibrohim Mo ªminov, a member of the Academy of Sciences of Uzbekistan, was the chief editor of volumes one through nine. Komiljon Zufarov was the chief editor of volumes ten through fourteen. The Uzbek Soviet Encyclopedia was not available in Russian.  Content  Despite the Marxist bias, the Uzbek Soviet Encyclopedia is a very comprehensive source of knowledge in social and economic studies and in the applied sciences. A major value of the encyclopedia is its comprehensive information about the USSR in general and the Uzbek SSR in particular. Every aspect of life in Soviet Uzbekistan is systematically presented, including history, economy, science, art, and culture. There are comprehensive biographies of prominent Uzbek cultural and scientific figures who are not as well known outside of Uzbekistan. The Uzbek Soviet Encyclopedia contains extensive writings on Sufism, and generally positive coverage of Uzbek Sufi philosophers such as Khoja Akhmet Yassawi. The encyclopedia initially criticized anti-Soviet writers such as Abdulrauf Fitrat and Cho ªlpon as bourgeois nationalists, but these figures were rehabilitated during glasnost.

Born in Buenos Aires, Argentina, he was raised in an Italian family and attended Italian primary and secondary school. He studied privately in Buenos Aires under (piano and interpretation), (harmony) and Ljerko Spiller (chamber music), obtained a degree in Mathematics from the University of Buenos Aires and a PhD in Statistics from Imperial College, London, under the supervision of Prof. Sir David Cox (statistician). Living in Europe in the early 70's he studied harpsichord with Colin Tilney in London and in Paris. He then returned to Buenos Aires, where he pioneered the performance of Baroque music based on ancient practices. He was Professor of Harpsichord and examiner of the Organ course at the Conservatorio Nacional in Buenos Aires. As a soloist he has performed extensively in concert halls, churches and television, both solo and with ensembles. After a harpsichord recital a reviewer observed that he \\"did not miss any detail in order to complete the historical legitimacy of his performance, and also produced a logical, live expressivness\\". After another concert the same reviewer noted his \\"virtuosity in the formidable 'Cadenza' of the Fifth Brandenburg Concerto\\", a performance which was the world's first contemporary one with Baroque fingerings. He has lived since 2001 in Ireland, where he has offered recitals and masterclasses on the interpretation of Baroque keyboard music. He is also musically active in Italy.

He was a justice of the peace for Suffolk from 1543 to 1547. During the 1540s Rous owned and leased various estates in Suffolk, including former monastic property at Dunwich, and manors including Middleton with Fordley (1544),W.A.

He was the tenant of the site of the late monastery of Sibton, with the north grange and south grange, when Edward VI granted it, together with Rendham, to Sir Anthony Denny in 1547, and it was Sir Anthony who granted the manor of Rendham (Barnes) to him in that year.Calendar of Patent Rolls, Edward VI, Vol. I: 1547-1548 (HMSO 1924), pp. 243-45, and p. 145 (Hathi Trust).W.A.

In a land dispute of the later 1540s he legally challenged the existence of the Corporation of Dunwich.The National Archives (UK), Chancery: Rous v Waller, ref. C 1/1259/38-40 (Discovery Catalogue). In 1550 he complained to the Chancellor of the Court of Augmentations that there were still two chantries functioning in Dunwich, one for the Maison Dieu (a hospital for the poor) and one for the parish church of St James, which led to the seizure of the documents and common seal of the house from the representatives of the Bailiffs.J.

E315/182/82. Favour under Marian rule Sir Edmund was knighted c. 1550. His service in Ireland appears to have begun in 1553, possibly in respect of his loyalty to Queen Mary in the succession crisis of that year: he became Vice-Treasurer of Ireland by December 1553. He was, nonetheless, in England for the elections of April 1554, when he was returned as Member of Parliament for Great Bedwyn. In October 1554 he was appointed (with the governors of Ireland) a commissioner to oversee the sale of Crown lands in Ireland, and named to receive the proceeds on behalf of the Crown.Calendar of Patent Rolls, Philip and Mary, Vol. II: 1554-1555 (HMSO 1936), p. 103 (Hathi Trust). In November 1554 he obtained the seat at Dunwich, and in 1555 that of Dover where he was nominated by Sir Thomas Cheney.Hyde, 'Rous, Sir Edmund', History of Parliament. He remained Vice-Treasurer of Ireland in March/April 1555, when he was granted the lordship of Athlone, with custody of the castle there (newly reconstructed by Sir William Brabazon), during pleasure, provided that he found room for the Council there whenever it might visit those parts;'1555: No. 72 (2)', Appendix to the Ninth Report of the Deputy Keeper of Public Records in Ireland (HMSO Dublin, 1877), Appendix IV, p. 66 (Internet Archive). his term had ended by September 1555 when he obtained an Order of Council to conduct a naval expedition in the north of Ireland, ostensibly for the purposes of fishing, but really as a pretext for a private-enterprise expedition against Scots intruders from Kintyre, led by one Cole. This expedition took place in 1556.C.S. Knighton and D. Loades (eds), The Navy of Edward VI and Mary I, Navy Records Society (Ashgate Publishing, Farnham 2011), pp. 277, 313-14. This is probably related to a licence issued in October 1555 to Sir Edmund and six others, their servants, factors and attorneys, to buy and convey 300 tuns of wine in vessels of any parts in amity with the kingdom.Calendar of Patent Rolls, Philip and Mary, Vol. 3: 1555-1557 (HMSO 1938), p. 107 (Hathi Trust). He appears then to have maintained royal favour, for Robert Wingfield of Brantham (who calls him \\"a man ready in service\\") shows him in attendance upon Mary with Sir Nicholas Hare, Owen Hopton and John Tyrrell, and reports his appointment as submarshal when Henry Bedingfeld was Knight Marshal.D.

This was during that interval in the long service of Ralph Hopton as Knight Marshal between 1556 and 1558, whose staunch Protestantism became irreconcileable with that position in the household. Despite his absences from Parliament Rous suffered little distraint on that account during Mary's reign,Hyde, 'Rous, Sir Edmund', History of Parliament. but his costs rose against him. In 1557 he was awarded 1,000 marks in respect of his rights in the manor of Okenhill at Badingham, payable by the Duke of Norfolk's executors,Suffolk Record Office, Ipswich: Iveagh (Phillips) Manuscripts, ref HD 1538/120/6 (Discovery Catalogue). and this together with manors in Kent and debts owing to him in Ireland were granted by Edmund to Philip and Mary in respect of his debt to them of ¬£3,420.The National Archives (UK), Exchequer: Grant, ref.

It was founded in 1963 by Anton Wallich-Clifford who had encountered many homeless people while working for the Probation Service at Bow Street Magistrates Court in London. Wallich-Clifford was influenced by the work of Dorothy Day and her Catholic Worker Movement in the USA and his original vision was to establish a farm and community in Sussex but local protests prevented this and the organisation developed as a chain of houses and night shelters run by local volunteers. The Simon Community was co- founded by political activist Eddie Linden. A trust was established to manage the affairs of the charity but its administration was weak. Attempts were made to transform the organisation into a decentralised federation of homelessness bodies -- the Cyrenian Federation and Homes for Homeless People. In Ireland the Simon Communities were founded by a group of Trinity College and University College Dublin students in 1969. It now operates all over Ireland, but particularly in Cork, Dublin, Dundalk and Galway. These organizations fund themselves by hosting a number of charity initiatives and events such as the Dublin Fun Run. In 2009, Dublin Simon celebrated its 40th anniversary.

Writing in The Village Voice, Nick Pinkerton described The Color Wheel as \\"a movie that's consistently unafraid to get confrontational and plain weird, with Colin's is-it-or-isn't-it-ironic racism, abrupt smothering close-ups, and scenes pushed past the boundaries of plausible motivation until they nosedive into absurdity.

Hearing two street musicians playing outside, Fosgrove has Corporal Flight bring them in. The musicians, George and Percy, are down at heel and highly unimpressive in appearance. Fosgrove passes them off to Stand as the two designated bodyguards, brilliantly disguised. To their horror, George and Percy are told that they must undertake a dangerous mission for their country. They are too frightened by authority to refuse and are mesmerised by the large bundle of banknotes Stand gives them for expenses. They are dispatched to collect Grobchick from his ship when it arrives in Dover from Turkey. Stand decides that they must pose as French waiters at the hotel in Dover where Grobchick will be staying.

Among others, he is currently a member of the editorial board of Dorre Dari (Pearl of Dari) () and Khatt-e-Sevom (Third Script) () Journals. Kazemi has authored many books on Persian literature and Afghan poetry. He has also written the book ‚ÄúRozaneh‚Äù (Window) () which has been published for the fourth time in Iran and is considered to be the most famous poetry textbook. He is currently living in Mashhad in the Islamic Republic of Iran. Personal life Kazemi was born into a religious family in Herat province of Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. His father, Haj Mohammad Ali Kazemi, was a socially and politically active person, and his grandfather, Haj Mohammad Kazem, was a poet himself. Kazemi went to high school in Herat and has lived there until 1975, when he left Herat for Kabul. In 1984, he left Afghanistan and immigrated to Iran in order to escape the War in Afghanistan and to pursue his studies. He studied Civil Engineering at Ferdawsi University of Mashhad. He started writing poetry at the age of fourteen. In Iran, Kazemi was introduced to the works of poets like Abdul-QƒÅdir Bƒìdil, Mohammad Ali Moalem Dameghani, and Khalilullah Khalili. Kazemi's poetry is influenced by those of Moalem and Bedil. It was the poem ‚ÄúBazgasht‚Äù (Return) (), written in 1991, that brought him national and international fame. Return, which is widely considered as an iconic poem in contemporary Persian poetry, narrates the story of an Afghan refugee in Iran who has decided to return to Afghanistan. Kazemi used very strong and in some way very ironical metaphors in this poem to emphasize on Afghan's suffering in Iran but he also highlighted the common culture and religious beliefs between the two nations. Today, almost every Afghan and Iranian can recite one or two lines from this poem. Since then, Return has inspired a host of responses both in and outside of Iran. Poetry Though lots of Kezemi's poetry has a religious theme, he has also written a lot about the socio-political situation in Afghanistan and in Iran. In his style of poetry, Kazemi is influenced by Abdul-QƒÅdir Bƒìdil and Moalem. In an interview with the Iranian website Soreh, Kazemi has told that he has memorized 3,000 verses of Bedil's poetry. Critics Many Afghan and Iranian writers and critics have praised Kazemi for his work and his efforts to introduce Afghan literature beyond Afghanistan‚Äôs borders and for his abilities as a poet and as a writer. However, the responses to Kazemi's work have not always been sympathetic.

His first novel received very positive reviews. He was prosecuted on obscenity charges after the publication of his second novel, but was acquitted after two trials. He was also a successful restaurateur. Early career Baxter was born in London and raised in Kent. He was educated at St. Lawrence College, Ramsgate and Trinity College, Cambridge where he studied law. He was articled to a solicitor in London before the war but following his service in the Army he never returned to the law. Baxter served in the British Army during the Second World War, as a company commander. The company fought in Burma, retreating to India. Later, he was aide-de-camp to Lieutenant General William Slim of the Fourteenth Army. He came back to London after the war and briefly joined his family's business, but in September 1949 he decided to pursue a career in writing. A few months later he became a Catholic. He was close to completing his first book when he was presented with an opportunity to volunteer with the Jesuits as a missionary. He performed that work for seven months at a jungle mission station in a remote village about from Ranchi, India. Look Down in Mercy Baxter's first novel, Look Down in Mercy, published in 1951, drew on his military experience. Set in Burma and other Far East locations during World War II, it centres on the homosexual relationship between an officer, Tony Kent, and his batman Anson. Although Kent, a British officer stationed in Burma, loves his wife back in England, he seduces a Eurasian nurse. After the brief affair, he feels guilty and hates both the girl and himself. Later, during an especially stressful period, he spends a night with Anson and loses self-respect because of the homosexual act. The officer and the batman are captured after a Japanese attack. Kent initially divulges nothing more than his name, rank and serial number, but after being shown how his fellow soldiers had been tortured, and he is threatened with the same, he reveals to his Japanese interrogator all of the information he knows. After an air raid, Anson is able to escape, also saving Kent. Their relationship resumes, and Kent kills a soldier who has figured this out and tried to blackmail him. After the company has arrived in India, Kent attempts suicide, but when unsuccessful, finds himself happy to be alive, and to be with Anson. Look Down in Mercy was hailed as \\"an uncommonly good first novel\\" by Time magazine, and has been deemed \\"a pioneering study of gay relationships in a hostile and indifferent world\\". A 1956 scholarly journal article, \\"The Most Neglected Books of the Past Twenty-Five Years\\", cited the novel as \\"very remarkable ... even as truly great\\", but claimed that most American critics had not acknowledged this. The Image and the Search His second novel, The Image and the Search, was published in October 1953. Baxter writes of Sarah, who is very happily married to RAF member Robert. Robert is the ideal \\"image\\" alluded to in the book's title. After Robert is killed in the war, Sarah embarks on a search for love to match that which she shared with Robert. She takes many lovers, but none can compare to Robert. While in India on business, she encounters Johan, who, although dark, bears a resemblance to Robert. Sarah tries to seduce Johan, but she does not succeed. Her quest for love has been futile. The novel was praised by E. M. Forster as \\"a serious and beautiful book\\". However, a Saturday Review Book Service critic wrote that the book's theme was intractable and the protagonist was unsympathetic; this critic also quipped that the heroine's climax in her pursuit \\"sets some sort of a new high in phallic symbolism\\". In March 1954, the Sunday Express printed a column in which Max Aitken, Lord Beaverbrook stated that the lesson to be surmised from the book's \\"erotic odyssey\\" was that \\"sexual excess can be indulged in with a light heart and a clear conscience\\". The column went on to suggest that Alexander Stewart Frere, the chairman of the book's publisher Heinemann, should immediately withdraw the book. A week later the Express quoted a Heinemann official as saying, \\"We have not withdrawn the book, it just isn't for sale any more.\\" Heinemann also withheld copies of the book from Putnam's, its New York publisher. A representative from Putnam's said that \\"the Sunday Express attack has succeeded in having the book banned. We regard this as an extremely unfortunate case of arbitrary censorship. We do not in the least agree with the Express position nor Heinemann's action.\\" In October 1954, Baxter and Frere were put on trial at the Old Bailey, charged under the Obscene Publications Act 1857 for The Image and The Search. Baxter released a statement that \\"my object was a serious portrayal of the vulnerability to evil of any ego-centred personality and the disintegrating effect of sin on such a personality\\". Frere also released a statement, saying in part, \\"I regard Walter Baxter as one of the most gifted writers of this generation, whose powers are not yet fully developed. I feel that the publishers owe a duty to such writers and to the public to ensure that their creative work is not still-born. If it has value and is not deleterious to potential readers, I was, and am myself, satisfied that this book would not harm any readers.\\" The case was prosecuted by Mervyn Griffith-Jones, who six years later led the unsuccessful prosecution in the case against Lady Chatterley's Lover. When the jury could not reach agreement after two trials, the defendants were acquitted. Later life The trials were disheartening for Baxter, and he would not write another book. Christopher Isherwood wrote in 1961 that Baxter \\"... has become a rather tragic self-pitying drunken figure with a philosophy of failure.\\" Baxter eventually became very successful in his new career as a restaurateur. His French restaurant in South Kensington, called The Chanterelle, was quite influential and highly regarded. Baxter met chef Fergus Provan in 1962. Baxter and Provan became companions ‚Äì a relationship which would last for thirty years. Beginning in 1978, they also had a professional connection, as Baxter retired and Provan took over the running of Baxter's restaurant. Baxter died on 25 July 1994.

Velde, Fran√ßois. House Laws of Lippe: The 1905 Verdict 2005. Retrieved 2012-05-31.  Marriage  On 16 September 1869 in Neudorf in the Province of Posen, she married Ernest II, Count of Lippe-Biesterfeld (1842-1904), who was regent of Lippe from 1897 to 1904. In the Lippe succession dispute (1904‚Äì1905), Schaumburg-Lippe claimed that Karoline, who belonged to a non-reigning family of Germany's lower nobility elevated to the rank of Graf (Count) in the 18th century (and whose mother was not noble by birth), was of insufficiently high rank by birth to be a dynastic consort for a Count of Lippe -- potentially rendering her sons ineligible to succeed to the throne of the Lippe principality. On 25 October 1905 the German Empire's arbitration panel (Reichsgericht) accepted an 1897 arbitration panel's finding that until at least 1815 marriages between the House of Lippe and untitled persons, if of old rather than recent noble status, were eligible to marry Lippe prince and counts dynastically. This was based on the finding that, such marriages, having been banned neither by previous house law nor by any clear marital pattern to the contrary prior to 1815, and that no change in dynastic policy had been explicitly implemented subsequently, the 1869 marriage to a Wartensleben countess was valid for purposes of transmitting succession rights to the descendants. Thus Karoline's children with the regent of Lippe, Count Ernest, became dynasts and the Schaumburg-Lippe Prince desisted his formal opposition. The monarchs, courts and legislatures of Germany accepted the decision and her eldest son was immediately recognised as Leopold II, sovereign Prince of Lippe,> reigning until compelled to abdicate in 1918 when the German Empire collapsed following the loss of World War I.

It was designed by Giuliano and Benedetto da Maiano in 1468 to enshrine the relics of Saint Fina. The side walls of the chapel are painted in fresco by Domenico Ghirlandaio with two scenes from her life, executed between 1477 and 1478. History After her death on 12 March 1253 the veneration of Fina dei Ciardi quickly grew to become the protector and saint patron of the city of San Gimignano. Her burial place, now close to the door of the sacristy, lay at that time in a small cloister, adjacent to the cemetery. In 1325 the commune of San Gimignano approved the erection of an altar within the church to contain her relics. In 1457 the city decided to build \\"a beautiful and honourable\\" chapel dedicated to Santa Fina to enshrine her relics. Works proceeded slowly until Giuliano da Maiano was summoned from Florence in 1468 to furnish the commune with a suitable design for the chapel. Giuliano was paid the sum of 11 lire 6 soldi. A papal bull issued by Pope Sixtus IV on October 1481, confirmed by Pope Paul III in 1538, permitted the public cult and veneration of Saint Fina as one of the saints of the Catholic Church. The chapel was consecrated by the Bishop of Pistoia on 4 October 1488. Architecture The architecture, completed in 1472, is inspired by Antonio Rossellino's Cardinal of Portugal Chapel in the basilica of San Miniato al Monte in Florence. It is one bay deep, each wall being defined by an arched recess. The arches support an entablature decorated by a color terracotta frieze with seraphim. Above the entablature are lunettes which include circular windows. The altar housing the saint's relics is a work by Benedetto da Maiano (1475) that bears relief scenes of Saint Fina's life. Above the altar is a tabernacle with a portrait of her on leather, an early 14th-century work by the Sienese Manno di Bandino. The urn on the tabernacle held the saint's bones until 1738. The upper lunette is decorated by a painting of the Madonna with Child between Two Angels. Around the side walls are stalls of carved and inlaid wood, by Antonio da Colle. The ceiling was adorned by Sebastiano Mainardi, Ghirlandaio's brother-in-law and master, with figures of the Evangelists and Doctors of the Church. The chapel was enclosed with a marble balustrade in 1661. Ghirlandaio frescoes Detail of the Announcement. The side walls of the chapel were frescoed by the Florentine painter Domenico Ghirlandaio between late 1477 and September 1478, at the same time as Benedetto da Maiano was working on the sculpture. An inscription on the tomb by the latter alludes to their simultaneous presence in 1475. Upon the sarcophagus decorated with naked genii runs the inscription attributed to Giovanni Battista Cantalicio, the author of laudatory verses in honour of the Saint Gregory printed in Venice in 1493: However, although it has been argued that the last line of the epitaph proves that Ghirlandaio painted the frescoes not later than 1475, this is not conclusive, as the subject and the composition had probably been settled from the beginning. Entries exist in the ledger of the works of the collegiate church of certain sums of money paid to Benedetto da Maiano for the epitaph of Santa Fina, under the dates of 29 May 1490 and 13 December 1493. The frescoes are Ghirlandaio's first known major commission, and show the first traces of his mature style. According to Saint Fina's hagiography, she had devoted her late life to a mystic devotion, which eventually led her to paraplegia. One day St. Gregory appeared to her to announce that she would be soon liberated by the illness in exchange for external life. On the day of her funeral, several miraculous events occurred, including the healing of her nurse, who suffered paralysis in her hand. The fresco on right wall of the chapel depicts, in the main field, St. Gregory the Great, supported by red-winged cherubim, appearing to Santa Fina to announce her death. Saint Fina, flanked by her nurses Beldia and Bonaventura, is praying while lying on a wooden plank. According to the legend, when she died the palette became covered with violets, which are typical March flowers at San Gimignano. The scene is a domestic interior with white-washed walls and a coffered ceiling. It is characterized by bright colours. The room is painted using geometrical perspective, and has a door which opens on a garden with rose bushes and a window through which can be seen a distant citadel. A rat under the bench in the background is a reference to Saint Fina's martyrdom (she was eaten alive by rats and worms). The other objects also have a symbolic meaning: the pomegranate is a symbol of royalty, fertility, resurrection and unity of the Church; the apple is a symbol of original sin; the wine refers to the Eucharist sacrament. The finely wrought platter is perhaps an autobiographic element, as Ghirlandaio's father was a goldsmith, and the artist had also received training in that art. The elaborate architectonic elements which frame the scene became a feature in numerous later works by Ghirlandaio. The Funeral of Saint Fina. On the wall of the painted room is a slab with an inscription in gold lettering of the following words by St. Gregory: Above a painted architrave at the top of the picture a small image shows two angels transporting the soul of the praying woman within an aureola. The scene on the left wall portrays the Funeral of Saint Fina. The saint is on her funeral bier, lying on a richly decorated brocade cloth, her head supported on a pillow. The scene is set in front of Renaissance exedra around the altar, decorated with precious marble, grooved pillars and composite capitals, supporting a rich entablature and a blue semi-dome. Behind the saint is her old nurse Beldia, who kneels as Saint Fina's hand touches hers, bringing about the miracle which healed her from paralysis. A second miracle is represented by the crying boy who is touching her toes, and will gain back his sight. A third miracle, that the bells of San Gimignano's towers were rung by angels, is suggested by a flying putto near one of the towers depicted in the background. The Torre Grossa, the town's tallest, is visible on the right. The painting also features Ghirlandaio's first true-life portraits, with gestures and face expressions familiar from daily life. The citizens depicted in the painting probably include the work's donors. The four pendentives that support the vault are decorated by the figures of prophets, while the lunettes feature Saints Ambrose, Nicholas, Jerome, Gimignano and Augustine, by Sebastiano Mainardi. The vault, finally, has the Four Evangelists, also by Mainardi. The style of this scheme, combining elements that are both historic and contemporary, was perhaps inspired by Filippo Lippi's Stories of St. Stephen and St. John the Baptist in the Prato Cathedral, and was later used by Ghirlandaio in the frescoes of the Sassetti Chapel in the basilica of Santa Trinita at Florence.

In 1997, he founded the Jack and Jill Foundation with his wife Mary Ann O'Brien, to provide home health care to severely sick babies. It was set up as a direct response to the Irwin‚Äôs experience of caring at home for their son Jack, born with severe brain damage in 1996.  Biography = Family and Early Life  Irwin was born into an Anglo-Irish family. His father, John Irwin (1913-1975), was an Irish actor, writer and a BBC producer and his mother Philippa Hiatt (b.1918), was a British stage and screen actress. He spent his early childhood in Coleshill, Buckinghamshire and later in Holland Park, London. He was educated at Eton College, Berkshire, and Trinity College, Dublin.  Personal life  On 22 February 1964 he married Mikaela Rawlinson (b.17 July 1941), the eldest daughter of Peter Rawlinson, Baron Rawlinson of Ewell, (1919-2006), and Rawlinson's first wife, Haidee Rawlinson (n√©e Kavanagh). He and Mikaela had four children: Pirate Irwin (b.1965), Luke Irwin (b.1967), Jago Irwin (b.1971) and Samson Fortune Irwin (1982 ‚Äì 2000). Irwin divorced Mikaela in 1989 after which he married Mary Ann O'Brien on 17 March 1991. With Mary Ann O'Brien, he had three sons and two daughters: Lily Irwin, Phonsie, John Irwin (died in infancy), Jack Irwin (29 February 1996 ‚Äì 13 December 1997) and Molly Irwin. Career= British Bloodstock Agency  Irwin's interest in racing began at Eton where he shared in a school bookmaking team with William Pigott-Brown and Jonathan Sheppard, son of Jockey Club Handicapper Dan Sheppard. By his second term at Trinity, his interest in racing had begun to overshadow his studies, when a friend of his mother's, the ex-Battle of Britain pilot Wing Commander Tim Vigors, asked him to join his Dublin bloodstock agency at IR¬£5 a week. Vigors and his partner Tom Cooper he singles out as the main influences in his life. \\"Integrity and a knowledge of the business I learnt from them.\\" When Vigors moved to England, the business was bought out by the British Blood Stock Agency and was subsequently renamed British Bloodstock Agency (Ireland) Ltd, and went on to be one of the leading bloodstock agencies in the country. By his mid-twenties Irwin was to become the director and remained with the company for fifteen years until 1974. During his time with the B.B.A. (Ireland) Ltd. he was perhaps best known for originating and introducing the Irish Stallion Incentive Scheme which was so successful that it morphed into the European Breeders Fund. He was elected a Member of the Irish Turf Club 1976. Irwin forged many valuable international connections and was largely responsible for the development of the highly lucrative Japanese trade in the late sixties and early seventies.  Irish Horseman Magazine  Irwin launched Irish Horseman in the 1960s which was to become the country's most popular thoroughbred publication. With a ¬£100 capital and the floor of his flat in Fitzwilliam Square for offices, he and two friends started the Irish Horseman's Magazine to fill a gap in Irish publishing and, having got it on its feet, he sold out to the Farmer's Journal. The Irish Horseman was a platform to promote the Irish horse and this single aim was the overriding reason which resulted in his move to Goffs Bloodstock Sales in 1974.  Goffs  Sunday Times Magazine: Jonathan Irwin, photographed in 1984. Robert J. Goff established Goffs in 1866 and was the only thoroughbred auction house in the country. Historically the 'cream' of the Irish yearling crop had up to that time been sold in England, at Tattersalls.Goff's Brochure 1974 In 1974 Irwin was approached by the Irish senator and racing patron Paddy McGrath to manage Goffs, then a small private company on the verge of bankruptcy. In the same year, Goffs were advised by their landlords that their sales complex in Dublin was to be sold. Goffs, who had auctioned at Ballsbridge for more than eighty years, suddenly found themselves siteless when their landlords, the Royal Dublin Society, sold the paddocks to Allied Irish Banks for more than ¬£4 million and then failed to come up with an alternative that satisfied either Goff's or the members of the Irish Bloodstock Breeders Association. Irwin was an early convert to the Myerscough family's brain-child of moving their sales to Kill, Co. Kildare. According to Irwin, \\"as various negotiations continued, it became clear to me that we could not return to the R.D.S. and be beholden to the same landlords as in the past with no security of tenure. I was in Australia when I heard the news that the R.D.S., whose Professor James Meenan had earlier given his blessing to the Kill project, had executed a volte-face and were back in contention.\\" Irwin felt that action was needed and got in touch with John Finney of Fasig Tipton USA, an American equine auctioneer firm, who agreed to come in. Thereafter there was no great problem in raising the finance but the group of underwriters had certain reservations about the existing management structure in Goffs. As a compromise he agreed to take the job. Thus Irwin replaced Robert Myerscough as managing director of R.J. Goff and Co. Ltd. on 1 January 1975 and oversaw the construction of the world's first purpose built bloodstock sales complex in Kill. The cost of the proposed complex to be built on a 74.6 acre site at Kill - was estimated at ¬£1.8 million as far back as August, 1974. According to Irwin he didn't want merely the most modern and best equipped sales complex, he also wanted a whole new approach to business within the horse industry. He was mortified \\"that class distinction should still be so rampant. It is difficult for an outsider to learn even how to buy a horse at a sale. Younger people just have to be attracted and to them and to everybody else my door will always be open.\\" Irwin's previous experience influenced the company turnover increase from ¬£3.2 million in 1975 to ¬£44 million by 1989. Many features introduced by Goffs have now become commonplace and his adaption of the Australian 'Million' incentive concept to the Cartier Million is recognised as one of the most successful innovations, introducing a whole new world of owners into horseracing. The Phoenix Park racetrack was rescued from closure in 1981 and in the nine years until it was sold for redevelopment became recognised as the most innovative track in Europe with the second largest betting and attendance figures in Ireland. It was unique in the world that every single one of the 120 races run annually at the track was sponsored.  Dublin International Sports Council  Irwin was appointed CEO of the Dublin International Sports Council (DISC) in 1993 under the chairmanship of Dr. Tony O'Reilly. The objective of the DISC was to raise Dublin's profile as a host venue for international sport and to lobby the government to provide facilities of international standard. Projects included the 1994 Women's Hockey World Cup, the 1995 Men's EuroHockey Nations Championship, the 1996 Notre Dame vs U.S. Naval Academy football game, and the first three stages of the 1998 Tour de France in Dublin. DISC also produced a research document for Dublin to bid for the 2012 and 2016 Summer Olympics.  The Jack and Jill Foundation  The Jack and Jill Children's Foundation was established by Irwin and his wife Mary Ann, as a result of their experiences following the birth of their son Jack in 1996. Due to complications shortly after birth, Jack developed severe brain-damage, which left him without sight or hearing, and unable to swallow. In a manner that shocked Irwin, he was advised by medical practitioners to abandon the baby in hospital. After ignoring that advice, they found themselves effectively abandoned instead, with no support-system in place to help them care for Jack at home. The family suffered significant trauma, and encountered a series of bureaucratic obstacles, before an offer of help from a retired nurse provided a catalyst which sustained them through the remaining months of their son's short life. Other nurses became involved with Jack's care, and out of the seeds of family anguish, fresh hopes grew for others. According to Irwin, he was profoundly shocked and angered to discover that there was no respite-aid available to parents in their circumstances until the baby reached the age of four. \\"We wanted to ensure that other families would not have to go through the same sort of ordeal, and we set up the Jack and Jill Children's Foundation to help provide a comprehensive range of support services for babies and their families.\\" The organisation campaigns to improve services for young children with disabilities, but Irwin says that progress towards reform of the system has been slow. Jack and Jill has been providing a network of support for individual families. Since 1997, the foundation has supported 1600 families throughout Ireland. It has raised ‚Ç¨36 million from the private sector while receiving ‚Ç¨4.5 million from the Irish health service. Awards received include Charity of the Year 2003, Irish Personality of the Year 2004, Irish Fundraiser of 2011 and Global Fundraiser of 2011.

Although the same basic plot recurs, different versions have included a variety of participants. The fable's history Vulpes et lignator from Sebastian Brant's 1501 edition of Aesop's Fables There are both Greek and Latin sources for the fable. They tell of a hunted animal that asks a man to hide it. When the hunters enquire if he has seen their quarry, he says he has not but indicates the hiding place by pointing to it or looking at it. The hunters take him at his word, however, and ride off. When the animal emerges, it reproaches the man for his double- dealing. Most Greek accounts make the animal a fox who appeals to a woodman. In the Latin poem of Phaedrus the hunted animal is a hare (lepus) who appeals to a herdsman. Later Latin versions mistake the name and make the animal a wolf (lupus). It was therefore told of a wolf in the earliest printed collections of Aesop's fables in the 15th century. A rather different version of the fable is ascribed to Aesop by the 2nd century philosopher Maximus of Tyre in his Dissertations. A lion pursuing a stag asks a shepherd if he has seen it. The man says he has not but points to the stag's hiding place, where it is killed by the lion. A fox then denounces the man as a servile coward.The dissertations of Maximus Tyrius (trans. T. Taylor), London 1804 Dissertation 33 Maximus applies the story to the taking of contradictory philosophical positions, but later writers see it as an illustration of hypocritical behaviour. The 16th century Neo-Latin poets Hieronymus OsiusFabulae Aesopi Fable 202 and Pantaleon Candidus both treated the fox version of the fable and commented on the discordant behaviour of saying one thing and doing another. Writing in the tradition of emblem books, Johannes Posthius brought out an illustrated Aesopi Fabulae (1566) in which a German verse treatment of the fables was prefaced by a short poem in Latin summing up the moral gist of each. Fable 127 deals with the Fox and the Woodman (Vulpes et lignator) and declares that, if you want a trustworthy reputation, word and hand should agree. The fable was also included in Poggio's prose collection of humorous anecdotes, the Facetiae, written during the 1450s.Vol.2, Paris 1879, Fable 163 He too saw it as an illustration of hypocritical behaviour, while Roger L'Estrange, one of the few to record the fable in English after William Caxton, comments that 'Conscience is as answerable for his Fingers as for his Tongue'.

The ranks of section and series are also used in botany for groups within genera, while section is used in zoology for a division of an order. Further levels in the hierarchy can be made by the addition of prefixes such as sub-, super-, infra-, and so on. Divisions such as \\"morph\\", \\"form\\", \\"variety\\", \\"strain\\", \\"breed\\", \\"cultivar\\", hybrid (nothospecies) and \\"landrace\\" are used to describe various sub-specific groups in different fields. It is possible for a clade to be unranked, for example Psoroptidia (Yunker, 1955) and the SAR supergroup. Sometimes a rank is described as clade where the traditional hierarchy cannot accommodate them.. Latin descriptions of names or taxa Note that in zoology the English descriptions, such as \\"conserved name\\", for example, are acceptable and generally used. These descriptions can be classified between accepted names (nom. cons., nom. nov., nom. prot.) and unaccepted combinations for different reasons (nom. err., nom. illeg., nom. nud., nom. rej., nom. supp., nom. van.), with some cases in between regarding the use (nom. dub.: used but not fully accepted; nom. obl.: accepted but not fully used, so it yields precedence to a nom. prot). * Candidatus (Ca.) - a taxon proposed from incomplete information, such as uncultured bacteria known from metagenomics * ex errore ‚Äì made in error * incertae sedis ‚Äì of uncertain placement * nomen alternativum (nom. alt.; plural: nomina alternativa) ‚Äì an alternative name, as for certain plant families * nomen conservandum (nom. cons.; plural: nomina conservanda) ‚Äì a conserved name * nomen dubium (nom. dub.; plural: nomina dubia) (zoo. bact. bot.(informal)) ‚Äì a name of questionable application ** nomen ambiguum (plural: nomina ambigua), (bot.) a name that has been used with more than one meaning ** nomen confusum (plural: nomina confusa), (bact.) a name based on a mixed bacterial culture ** nomen perplexum (plural: nomina perplexa), a name confusingly similar to another name or names ** nomen periculosum (plural: nomina periculosa), an name which can lead to dangerous outcomes, through confusion * nomen erratum (nom. err.; plural: nomina errata) - a name given in error * nomen illegitimum (nom. illeg.; plural: nomina illegitima) ‚Äì an illegitimate name * nomen invalidum (nom. inval.; plural: nomina invalida) ‚Äì an invalid name * nomen manuscriptum - a name that appears in a manuscript * nomen monstrositatum (nom. monstr.) ‚Äì a name based on a monstrosity (fasciation, phyllody or similar deformities) * nomen novum (nom. nov.; plural: nomina nova) ‚Äì a replacement name * nomen nudum (nom. nud.; plural: nomina nuda) ‚Äì a name published without an accompanying description * nomen oblitum (nom. obl.; plural: nomina oblita) ‚Äì a name which has been overlooked (literally, forgotten) and is no longer valid * nomen protectum (nom. prot.; plural: nomina protecta) ‚Äì a name granted protection * nomen rejiciendum (nom. rej.; plural: nomina rejicienda) ‚Äì a name that has been rejected and cannot be used * nomen suppressum (nom. supp.; plural: nomina suppressa) ‚Äì a name that has been suppressed and cannot be used * nomen vanum (plural: nomina vana) - not a useful term, has been used to mean either a nomen dubium (see above in this list), or an invalid change in spelling, better called an unjustified emendationOn the use of the term nomen vanum in taxonomy.

In late 1941, there were two regular and ten reserve divisions in the Army of the Philippines, with about 100,000 to 300,000 active troops and officers in the general headquarters, camps in Manila and across the provinces of the Philippines. Among them were the Visayan-Mindanao Force under Colonel William F.

The 61st Division was commanded by BGen. Bradford G. Chynoweth (USA), and the division Chief of Staff was Col. Albert F. Christie, Inf.

The resistance movement on Panay was unique.MacArthur Reports: Chapter X: Resistance Movement in the Philippines It developed rapidly ; there was a minimum of discord; and a dynamic leader emerged at an early time. The guerrilla structure on Panay was built around a core of refugee troops of the Philippine 61st Division who had taken to the hills immediately after the surrender orders were published. Scarcely ten weeks after the Japanese invasion, Colonel Macario Peralta, Jr., former G-3 of the division and a man of strong and driving character, assumed undisputed control of the main guerrilla groups. The early emergence of a generally accepted leader and the availability of a relatively large amount of salvaged supplies and equipment gave a powerful impetus to the formation of a smoothly working guerrilla command. The first reactivated Philippine military district commanders were appointed in February 1943.MacArthur Reports: Chapter X: Resistance Movement in the Philippines LCol. Peralta was given command of the 6th Military District on Panay. He already exercised considerable influence over adjacent islands, and thus was given temporary control over the 7th and 8th Districts of Negros and Cebu. The small guerrilla bands on Masbate, Marinduque, Mindoro, and Palawan, having no outstanding leaders of their own, remained under the domination of the 6th Military District. Colonel Peralta soon developed one of the most extensive and efficient intelligence systems in the Philippines.

Jane Caswell rents the room, whilst her alleged brother Pete Caswell soon joins the household too, although it becomes clear that they are both not what they seem. Jane claims she's a vet and her brother claims he's a cop. Things go to extremes when Cole finds evidence of their criminal activity, leading the two young psychos-in-love to terrorize her. When Jane kidnaps and threatens to kill Cole's son, she has no choice but to overcome her paralyzing fears and attempt to leave her home to save him.

They commented: \\"Woman-in-peril movies show up on TV as often as Dan Quayle jokes. There are a few tense moments, thanks to Rubin's manic-performance and some noir-ish camera work. The excitement evaporates as the story becomes increasingly predictable. When the movie gels down to its big finish, it has become more silly than scary. The ending goes on forever, with Lahti continually breaking free from these wackos and then getting recaptured.

For three years he suffered loss of vision, as a result he was replaced by Bishop Anastasius of Kalocsa (or Astrik). In 1005 he was healed, and sanctified the church of the monastery of Pannonhalma.

The bench was occupied by Chaskalson P, Langa DP, Ackermann J, Goldstone J, Kriegler J, Madala J, Mokgoro J, O'Regan J, Sachs J and Yacoob J. DJB Osborn (with him PJ Van Blerk) appeared for the appellants, RM Wise (with him J. Kentridge) for the first respondent, and CZ Cohen (with him M. Chaskalson) for the second, third, fourth and fifth respondent.  Principles  The interim Constitution recognises and makes provision for three levels of government: national, provincial and local. Each level of government derives its powers from the interim Constitution. In the case of local government, however, the powers are subject to definition and regulation by either the national or the provincial governments, which are the \\"competent authorities\\" for enacting such legislation. Under section 174(1) of the interim Constitution, though, there is a constitutional obligation on the \\"competent authority\\" to establish local government, which has to be \\"autonomous and, within the limits prescribed by or under law [...] entitled to regulate its affairs.\\"s 174(3). In section 174(4), it is specifically provided that \\"Parliament or a provincial legislature shall not encroach on the powers, functions and structure of a local government to such an extent as to compromise the fundamental status, purpose and character of local government.\\" In terms of section 175 (2), the competent authority is also obliged to assign to a local government \\"such powers and functions as may be necessary to provide services for the maintenance and promotion of the well- being of all persons within its area of jurisdiction.\\" In section 175(4), the interim Constitution specifically provides that a \\"local government shall have the power to make by-laws not inconsistent with this Constitution or an Act of Parliament or an applicable provincial law.\\" Section 178(2) gives local government a taxing power subject to certain conditions. The constitutional status of local government is thus materially different from what it was when Parliament was supreme, when not only the powers but the very existence of local government depended entirely on superior legislatures. Although the detailed powers and functions of local governments have to be determined by laws of a competent authority, this does not mean that the powers they exercise are \\"delegated\\" powers; nor does it prevent the powers from being regarded as \\"original\\" and not \\"delegated.\\"Paras 35-39. While section 24 of the interim Constitution applies to the exercise of powers delegated by a council to its functionaries, the court in the present case found it difficult to see how it can have any application to by-laws made by the council itself. The council is a deliberative legislative body whose members are elected. The legislative decisions taken by them are influenced by political considerations for which they are politically accountable to the electorate. Such decisions must, of course, be lawful, but the requirement of legality exists independently of, and does not depend on, the provisions of section 24(a). The procedures according to which legislative decisions are to be taken are prescribed by the Constitution, the empowering legislation and the rules of the council. While this legislative framework is subject to review for consistency with the Constitution, the making of by-laws and the imposition of taxes by a council in accordance with the prescribed legal framework cannot appropriately be made subject to challenge by \\"every person\\" affected by them on the grounds contemplated by s 24(b). Nor, the court found, are the provisions of s 24(c) or (d) applicable to decisions taken by a deliberative legislative assembly. The deliberation ordinarily takes place in the assembly in public, where the members articulate their own views on the subject of the proposed resolutions. Each member is entitled to his or her own reasons for voting for or against any resolution and is entitled to do so on political grounds. It is for the members, not the Courts, to judge what is relevant in such circumstances. Sections 24(c) and (d) cannot sensibly be applied to such decisions. The enactment of legislation by an elected local council in accordance with the Constitution is, in the ordinary sense of the words, a legislative and not an administrative act.Paras 41-42. It seems plain, the court determined, that when a legislature, whether national, provincial or local, exercises the power, conferred by section 178(2) of the interim Constitution, to raise taxes or rates, or determines appropriations to be made out of public funds, it is exercising a power that under the Constitution is a power peculiar to elected legislative bodies. It is a power that is exercised by democratically elected representatives after due deliberation. Such action of the municipal legislatures, in resolving to set the rates, to levy the contribution and to pay a subsidy out of public funds, cannot be classed as administrative action as contemplated by section 24 of the interim Constitution. In the past, the action of a municipal council in setting rates was considered to be an action that was subject to judicial review on the principles of administrative law, but the principles upon which that jurisprudence was based are no longer applicable. It follows that the imposition of rates and levies, and the payment of the subsidies, do not constitute \\"administrative action\\" under section 24 of the interim Constitution.Para 45.  Judgment  The Court accordingly held that the rates imposed by the first respondent, the transitional metropolitan council, and its four metropolitan substructures, the levies paid by two of the substructures to the first respondent and the subsidies paid by the first respondent to the other two substructures, in terms of the powers conferred on them by the interim Constitution, read with Premier's Proclamations 24 of 1994 (Gauteng), 35 of 1995 (Gauteng) and 42 of 1995 (Gauteng), which were enacted in terms of section 10 of the Local Government Transition Act,Act 209 of 1993. did not constitute \\"administrative action\\" under section 24 of the interim Constitution.Para 45. The primary provisions of the interim Constitution regulating local government are contained in Chapter 10. To the extent, therefore, that a local government acts in breach of one of the direct and mandatory provisions of Chapter 10, it is clear that that infringement will be in breach of the Constitution and subject to constitutional challenge. Local government is also subject to Chapter 3 of the interim Constitution. It is also clear from Chapter 10 that the powers, functions and structures of local government provided for in the Constitution will be supplemented by powers, functions and structures provided for in other laws made by a competent authority. There is no doubt, the court held, that the common-law principles of ultra vires remain under the new constitutional order. However, they are underpinned (and supplemented where necessary) by a constitutional principle of legality. In relation to \\"administrative action,\\" the principle of legality is enshrined in section 24(a) of the Constitution. In relation to legislation, and to executive acts that do not constitute \\"administrative action,\\" the principle of legality is necessarily implicit in the Constitution. The question, therefore, of whether or not local governments act intra vires in imposing rates and levies, and paying subsidies, remains a constitutional question.Paras 53-54, 59. The Court held further that the applicants' constitutional challenge to the validity of the levying of the rates in question by the second respondent (the Eastern Metropolitan Substructure) based on the alleged non-compliance with section 178(2) of the interim Constitution and the challenge to the validity of the budgets of the first and second respondents, based on non-compliance with section 58 of the Local Government Ordinance 17 of 1939 (T), had on an analysis of the facts to fail. The Court held that the rates had been validly imposed.Paras 62-64, 67-71, 73. The Court further held that the imposition of a levy by the first respondent on the second respondent in an amount equal to the budgeted surplus of the second respondent for the financial year ended 30 June 1997, and the use of that levy to meet the deficits in the budgets of the first respondent and two other of the first respondent's metropolitan substructures (the fourth and fifth respondents), could not be justified as \\"a grant or donation\\" under section 79(15)(i) of the Local Government Ordinance, as that had not been the decision which the council of the second respondent had taken. The council had considered the draft budget on the assumption that it fell within the powers of the first respondent to levy a contribution upon the second respondent for the purpose of subsidising itself and the fourth and fifth respondents. It was not known what the attitude of the members of the second respondent's council would have been had they been faced with a decision to make a donation or grant: That question was never before the council of the second respondent. Furthermore, the difference between the two was one of substance and not merely one of form.Paras 76-78. Whether item 23(c) of Annexure A to Premier's Proclamation 35 of 1995 (Gauteng), which is the same as item 23(c) of Schedule 2 to the Local Government Transition Act 209 of 1993, is construed as a condition for raising a levy prescribed in the Local Government Transition Act by a competent authority as contemplated by section 178(2) of the interim Constitution, or as a power vested in the Greater Johannesburg Transitional Metropolitan Council independently of section 178(2), the \\"levy,\\" held the court, has to comply with the provisions of item 23(c).Para 88. As to the question of whether or not the levy raised by the first respondent against the second and third respondents complied with the requirement of item 23(c), namely that it was \\"an equitable contribution from\\" the substructure \\"based on the gross or rates income of such\\" substructure, the Court was evenly divided. In a joint judgment by Chaskalson P, Goldstone J and O'Regan J (Ackermann J and Madala J concurring), it was held that meaning and significance had to be attributed to the distinct requirements of item 23(c). The mere fact that a levy might be said to be equitable in all the circumstances did not dispense with or detract from the stipulation that it had also to be based on gross or rates income. It was further held that the word \\"based\\" in item 23(c) implied that there should also be some relationship between the calculation of the levy and the incomes referred to. The levy imposed by the first respondent on the second and third respondents was not fixed as a proportion or a percentage of either gross or rates income; nor was it related directly in any way to either gross or rates income. The levy was a surplus produced from the total income after agreement had been reached as to the expenditure to be incurred by the second and third respondents: To read \\"gross or rates income\\" as meaning \\"net income after allowing for all expenses of the substructure\\" was to ignore the inclusion of the words \\"gross or rates\\" in the phrase, and thereby to do violence to the provision as a whole. The levy was accordingly not based on gross or rates income, and therefore did not comply with the requirements of item 23(c).Paras 92-95, read with para 74. Per contra, Kriegler J (Langa DP, Mokgoro J, Sachs J and Yacoob J concurring) held, firstly, that the attack on the imposition of the levy based on the contention that it fell foul of the requirement of section 178(2) of the interim Constitution, because it was not \\"based on a uniform structure for its area of jurisdiction,\\" could not succeed. It could not be said that anything other than a uniform structure had been applied. The very purpose of the co- ordination of the budgets of the first respondent and its four substructures (the second to fifth respondents) had been to apply a uniform method of estimating both the income and the expenditure of each substructure. It was an express component of that method that each budget would be balanced and that such balance would be attained uniformly by taking away any excess and supplementing any deficit. What section 178(2) required was a uniform structure on the basis of which revenue was to be raised, not identical rates or tariffs. There had in the present case been a uniform basis for charging all municipal imposts throughout the metropolitan area. The challenge based on non-compliance with section 178(2) failed.Paras 166-168. Secondly, with regard to the alleged non-compliance with item 23(c) of Annexure A to Proclamation 35 of 1995, it was held that there was no ground for suggesting that the levy was not fair and should be set aside on the ground of inequity.Para 169. It was further held that item 23(c) used a phrase of wide generality to link the contribution to the income, namely \\"based on.\\" It had not been specified that the levy had to be a fraction or percentage of income, and all that was required was some relationship between contribution and income. The uniform structure referred to above entailed accepting a platform above which a levy would be imposed on a substructure and the common platform above which the levy was payable was a substructure's estimated expenditure. The amount of the levy was also related to the substructure's gross income. The excess of such gross income over and above expenditure constituted the levy. That the levy equalled the surplus did not‚Äîand could not in logic‚Äîmean that the levy was not related to the gross income; on the contrary, gross income was the very basis for its calculation. It was not correct, as the judgment of Chaskalson P, Goldstone J and O'Regan J had it, that this conclusion entailed reading \\"gross or rates income\\" as meaning \\"net income after allowing for all expenses of the substructure.\\" The contribution was not based on net income; it was indeed the net income based on gross income and expenditure. The levy on each of the substructures was clearly a surplus produced after account had been taken of the expenditure budgeted for by that substructure. That surplus was based on gross income. Accordingly, the levy was clearly based on the gross or rates income of each of the substructures. In the result the appellants' attacks based on the alleged non-compliance with the requirements of section 178(2) of the interim Constitution and item 23(c) of Annexure A to Proclamation 35 of 1995 had to be dismissed.Paras 170-173, 177-178. The Court accordingly held that, because it was unanimous that the rates levied by the second respondent were lawful, the attack made on them by the appellants had to be dismissed. As the Court was evenly divided on the lawfulness of the contributions levied by the first respondent on the second and third respondents, the appeal on those issues was not successful and had to be dismissed. In the result, the appeal as a whole had to be dismissed.Para 115. Having regard to item 17 of Schedule 6 to the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa Act 108 of 1996, it is in the interests of justice that in respect of constitutional issues under the interim Constitution which may in future come before it, the SCA, as the successor of the Appellate Division, should exercise the jurisdiction conferred upon it over constitutional matters by Chapter 8 of the 1996 Constitution. Its exercise of that jurisdiction, however, will not affect the principle articulated in S v Mhlungu1995 (3) SA 867 (CC). and Du Plessis v De Klerk1996 (3) SA 850 (CC). in terms of which the constitutionality of an act is to be determined by the substantive provisions applicable at the time.Para 113.

Biography Pyotr Veinberg was born in Nikolaev, to the family of a notary. After studying in the Odessa gymnasium and Richelieu's lyceum he joined Kharkov University's history and philology faculty, from which he graduated in 1854. For the next three years he was working in Tambov as a local governor's aide, editing the Tambov Governorate News newspaper‚Äôs unofficial section. One of his first poems, \\"He was a titular councillor\\" (1859), was an autobiographical one and dealt with his own unrequited love for the governor's daughter. Veinberg, Jewish by birth, adopted Christianity in his youth. Pyotr Veinberg's literary career started in 1851 when the Panteon magazine published his translation of George Sand‚Äôs Claudie drama. In 1854 in Odessa a small compilation of his translations from Horace, Andr√© Ch√©nier, Victor Hugo and Lord Byron came out. In 1856 The Russian Messenger published several of Veinberg‚Äôs own poems, subtitling it, mistakenly, \\"From Heine\\". This prompted the author to use a pseudonym, \\"Heine from Tambov\\". In 1858 Veinberg moved to Saint Petersburg to embark upon a professional literary career. His poems and translations started to appear regularly in Sovremennik, Biblioteka Dlya Chteniya, Syn Otechestva, later in Nekrasov's Otechestvennye Zapiski. He became known as a satirist when the Veseltchak magazine published in 1858 his poetry cycle Grey-Colored Melodies and a series of humorous sketches called Life and Its Oddities. From 1859 to 1866 Veinberg contributed to Iskra magazine. Many of his work published there featured in the Humorous Poems of Heine from Tambov compilation (Saint Petersburg, 1863). From 1868 to 1874 Veinberg worked as the head of the Russian literature cathedra at the Warsaw University. His treatise \\"Russian Folk Songs About Ivan the Terrible\\" was praised by academic A.N.Veselovsky. On return to the capital he joined the Saint Petersburg University's Literature cathedra and lectured in several colleges and courses. In 1884 Weinberg adapted Ivan Turgenev‚Äôs Home of the Gentry for theater production. In 1885 he wrote a libretto for Eduard N√°pravn√≠k's opera Harold. He compiled several textbooks on literature and theater and wrote a book Extracts from the History of Western Literature (1907). Several of his verses were put to music by composers like Cui, Grechaninov, Ippolitov-Ivanov. In his later years Veinberg was an active member of the Russian Literary Fund. In 1905 he was elected an honorary member of the Russian Academy. Using his authority he did a lot to help authors persecuted by the government for political reasons; Maxim Gorky, German Lopatin and others.

CRU is an organisation with three key ministry areas: * CRU Camps, which includes: CRU Holiday Camps, CRU Study Camps and CRU Day Camps * Summit Educational Camps and * Schools Ministry (made up of CRU School Groups and CRU Resources) CRU's frontline ministries are supported by two campsites (Galston Gorge Conference & Recreation Centre & Lake Mac Outdoor Recreation Centre), and a Training Division. History Crusaders was founded in 1930 in New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland and South Australia by the Rev. Dr Howard Guinness, a visionary man keen to strengthen Christian work among school students in independent schools. He saw voluntary groups as a key to achieving this. The first Crusader Camp was held in 1930. In 1934 CRU was founded in Western Australia. From small beginnings in just four schools, CRU has expanded to serve 185 Independent schools in New South Wales and the ACT. The Crusader Women's Fellowship, began at Roseville Park in 1939 and has maintained an unbroken record of fellowship, prayer and support for the ministry. The group continues to meet to this day. The land for the Crusader site at Lake Macquarie NSW was donated by Dr Leslie Parr in the 1940s and in the 1950s Dr Paul White mortgaged his home to buy land at Galston Gorge site for ¬£600. These sites are where the majority of CRU Camps take place. In 1955 CRU merged with Scripture Union in all states except NSW. During the 1960s CRU became a Registered Company Limited by Guarantee to meet legal requirements. Initially established in Sydney's CBD, the office relocated to Strathfield in 1988, then Eastwood in 1993. The Crusader Union of NSW became the Crusader Union of Australia on 23 May 1990 and the current Crusader ‚Äòeagle‚Äô logo was introduced in 1997. The CRU Camp brand was trademarked in 2002 and CRU celebrated its 80th anniversary in September 2010. CRU continues to grow and currently over 2,500 students are reached each week with the Gospel of Jesus Christ.Crusaders Timeline. Retrieved 1 June 2012 CRU Camps CRU run many different types of camps, the main ones being: CRU Holiday Camps 60+ camps are run during the school holidays each year for children aged between 6‚Äì18.

The book was released on June 5, 2012, as a sequel to The Bourne Dominion. Plot summary The man Jason Bourne fished out of the freezing sea is near death, half-drowned and bleeding profusely from a gunshot wound. He awakens with no memory of who he is or why he was shot-and Bourne is eerily reminded of his own amnesia. Then Bourne discovers that the Mossad agent named Rebeka is so determined to find this injured man that she has gone off the grid, cut her ties to her agency, and is now being stalked by Mossad's most feared killer. Do the answers to these mysteries lie back in southeast Lebanon, in a secret encampment to which Bourne and Rebeka escaped following a firefight weeks ago? The complex trail links to the mission given to Treadstone directors Peter Marks and Soraya Moore: find the semi-mythic terrorist assassin known as Nicodemo. In the course of Bourne's desperate, deadly search for a secret that will alter the future of the entire world, he will experience both triumph and loss, and his life will never be the same. Now everything turns on the amnesiac. Bourne must learn his identity and purpose before both he and Rebeka are killed. From Stockholm to Washington, D.C., from Mexico City to Beijing, the web of lies and betrayals extends into a worldwide conspiracy of monumental proportions. Reception David Pitt of Booklist commented, \\"Unlike Ludlum, whose prose frequently tended toward the stodgy, Van Lustbader pulls readers through the story with gusto, as Bourne confronts a man in a situation very much like his own, and Treadstone agents Marks and Moore try to determine whether they can trust a new man on the team. For series fans, a solid continuation of Bourne's story.\\" References 2012 American novels American spy novels American thriller novels Bourne novels Novels by Eric Van Lustbader ","title":"The Bourne Imperative"},{"id":"35993981","text":"Bowlby is an unincorporated community in Monongalia County, West Virginia.

Publication history The character was introduced in the mini-series Battle Scars. He bears a strong resemblance to the Ultimate Marvel version of Nick Fury and the Marvel Cinematic Universe incarnation as portrayed by Samuel L. Jackson; the Ultimate version's appearance was based on that of Jackson before the actor's portrayal in the films. Nick Fury Jr. appears in the 2013 Secret Avengers series by Nick Spencer and Luke Ross. In January 2017, Marvel announced that the character would get his first ongoing solo series named Nick Fury. Fictional character biography Nick Fury Jr. in Battle Scars #6 (April 2012). Art by Scot Eaton.

During the \\"Civil War II\\" storyline, Fury was on a mission to neutralize a Hydra cell that were posing as S.H.I.E.L.D. Agents. The prediction of Ulysses Cain's vision had the Hydra cell's attack on S.H.I.E.L.D. be fatal. When heading to a base in Arizona, Fury was attacked by actual agents instead of Hydra infiltrators as suspected. In order for him to find the traitors, Fury faked his death and went under the radar.Civil War II: Choosing Sides #1. Marvel Comics. Upon interrogating dirty S.H.I.E.L.D. benefactor Elton Blake, Fury was directed to the S.H.I.E.L.D. base Ulu in Alaska.Civil War II: Choosing Sides #2. Marvel Comics.

Fury then gives Castle access to the War Machine armor for a deniable operation against a rogue Eastern European state caught using old S.H.I.E.L.D. resources.Punisher #218. Marvel Comics. Powers and abilities Nick Fury Jr. initially appears to have no superhuman qualities but his physical conditioning from his time with the US Army Rangers. However, he inherited his father's Infinity Formula at birth, slowing his aging process, speeding his healing time, and granting him peak human physical abilities. Reception The reaction by comic book fans to the revelation of Marcus Johnson being Nick Fury's son and replacing his father has been mixed. Tom Brevoort (Marvel's Vice President of publishing) believes this is a prudent move by Marvel because the African American incarnation appears in films, animated shows, and other licensed adaptations. In other media Since the 2000s, most appearances of Nick Fury in other media have been modeled on the Ultimate Marvel version of the character which is based on actor Samuel L. Jackson who later portrayed the character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe movies.

Background The Bristol & Exeter Railway was authorised by act of Parliament in 1836, following quickly on the 1835 act for construction of the Great Western Railway. Bristol merchants were anxious to secure a railway route to Exeter, which was an important commercial centre, and which had a harbour on the south coast, in the English Channel. Coastal shipping from the South coast and from continental Europe making for Bristol needed to navigate the hazardous north Cornwall coast after negotiating the waters round Land's End. Isambard Kingdom Brunel was appointed engineer, and his assistant William Gravatt surveyed the route in 1835 and was resident engineer for the section between Bristol and White Ball, with William Froude supervising the section from Whiteball to Exeter. Brunel himself was in charge of the design of White Ball tunnel. The first , broad gauge, section of the line was completed to Bridgwater on 14 June 1841, and the extension to Taunton in July 1842 ‚Äì both using trains leased from the Great Western. At Norton Fitzwarren just west of Taunton, the intention was to split the railway three ways: *A branchline via the West Somerset Railway to Minehead *A junction with the Devon and Somerset Railway, a secondary route to Barnstaple *The mainline to Exeter via Wellington Construction From Creech St Michael westwards, the B&ER; had followed the gently flowing valley of the River Tone. But just east of Wellington, the river moved further west up the steep sides of the Blackdown Hills. Brunel chose to follow a smaller valley eastwards, and pass under the Blackdowns further west, through a place called White Ball, a hill made up of easy to dig white sandstone (NB: next to it is Red Ball, a hill of red sandstone). This route would reduce the need for additional tunnelling, and allow connection with and traffic from Wellington. However, the choice also meant the construction of a long inclined bank, with a tunnel at its peak. Wellington station opened when the line reached the town on 1 May 1843, laid out as a standard Brunel railway station. The line then proceeded west at gradients averaging a 1 in 80 incline towards Sampford Arundel, a village situated south west of Taunton, where the tunnel entrance was to be dug. Digging of the tunnel commenced in 1842. A temporary terminus was established in the hamlet of Beam Bridge on 1 May 1843, from which passengers were taken by carriage to the far side of the hill, and then taken by another train from Burlescombe, Devon to Exeter. From January 1842, 1,000 navvies were encamped at White Ball. With access to a local Tommy shop, they sank 14 vertical shafts during the tunnel's construction. The temporary terminus at Beam Bridge stayed in place for a year, until the tunnel was opened on 1 May 1844. Operations The Bristol & Exeter Railway was a considerable financial success and between 1844 and 1874, paying an average annual dividend of 4.5 per cent. The city fathers of Exeter refused the railway access to the dock of the Exeter Canal until 35 years after it entered the city in 1844. The railway was fully amalgamated with the Great Western Railway on 1 January 1876. Due to the steepness of the bank, special operational procedures were required. *Northbound heavy goods trains would stop south of Whiteball tunnel, often at Tiverton Junction, and pin their brakes as appropriate. *Southbound trains would stop at Wellington, where a banking locomotive would be applied to the rear of the train. This would bank the train up the embankment and through the tunnel, before releasing itself before Tiverton, where it would reverse back down the bank. With the full introduction of higher powered diesel locomotives, the banking procedure was ceased in the late 1960s. 100mph speed record GWR 3700 Class No.3440 City of Truro On 9 May 1904, whilst descending Wellington Bank, the GWR 3700 Class No. 3440 City of Truro was timed at 8.8 seconds between two quarter-mile posts, whilst hauling the \\"Ocean Mails\\" special from Plymouth to London Paddington. This timing was recorded from the train by Charles Rous- Marten, who wrote for The Railway Magazine and other journals. If exact (Rous- Marten's stopwatch read in multiples of 1/5 second), this time would correspond to a speed of , while 9 seconds would correspond to exactly 100 mph. Initially, mindful of the need to preserve their reputation for safety, the railway company allowed only the overall timings for the run to be put into print; neither The Times report of the following day nor Rous-Marten's article in The Railway Magazine of June 1904 mentioned the maximum speed. However the morning after the run two local Plymouth newspapers did report that the train had reached a speed between 99 and 100 miles an hour whilst descending Wellington Bank. This claim was based on the stopwatch timings of a postal worker, William Kennedy, who was also on the train. Rous-Marten first published the maximum speed in 1905, though he did not name the locomotive or railway company: Before his death in 1908 Rous-Marten did name the locomotive as City of Truro. Official confirmation from the Great Western Railway came in 1922 when they published a letter written in June 1905 by Rous-Marten to James Inglis, the general manager, giving further details of the record. This sequence of eight quarter-mile timings is thought to start at milepost 173, the first after the tunnel, with the maximum speed at milepost 171. From 1922 onwards City of Truro featured prominently in the Great Western Railway's publicity material. Doubts over the record centred on the power of the locomotive and some contradictions in Rous-Marten's passing times. However his milepost timings are consistent with a speed of 100 mph or just over. The latest research examines the evidence and uses computer simulation of the locomotive performance to show that a speed of 100 mph was possible and that the timings do indeed support such a speed. This record was set before any car or aeroplane had attained such a speed. However, in May 1904 City of Truro was not the fastest vehicle in the world, as had been reached the previous year on an experimental electric railway near Berlin.

She died from a diabetic coma at age 21, and her masterpiece is Au-del√†, an anthology of poems published by Philippe Godet. Biography Alice de Chambrier was born on 28 September 1861 in Neuch√¢tel, to Alfred de Chambrier and Sophie de Sandol-Roy, belonging to a family who played some part in public affairs at the time. She was only one year old when she lost her mother. She grew up in Neuch√¢tel; vivacity and gentleness was her nature. She spent all her life in Neuch√¢tel, except 18 months during which she travelled to Darmstadt, between 1876 and 1877. She desired to live some time abroad in order to learn German; she learnt it so swiftly that she lost no time in finishing composing some allegorical playlet in German verses to be played by her schoolmates. Back from Darmstadt, the vivacious child had become a young lady who, under the mask of good manners, calm and even temper, was concealing powerful feelings and an extraordinary sensitiveness. She did not write her first work until she was 17. She attended a girls' school, called l'Ecole Sup√©rieure des Jeunes Demoiselles, where her first compositions acquired some popularity. Especially, her poem the Atlandide (Atlantis, in English) telling the ancient legend of the lost continent swallowed up by the sea, was recited in a public performance, by the actress Madame Ernst. Since this event, she has been considered as a poet; and the very day her father authorised her to give herself to poetry she felt fulfilled and declared that her life was now shadowlessly happy. She received precious advice from Madame Breton, n√©e Samson, the daughter of the famous tragedian, and from the Actress Mme Agar who performed in Racine's masterpiece. It was the performances of this tragedian and her affection that really decided the career of the young author. She wrote a number of works, not only poems, but also comedies, dramas, and short stories. She won a lot of awards in various contests, the first of all in 1880 for the 'Phare de Cordouan' at the Acad√©mie des Muses Santones, in Rouen. She also gained a primev√®re d'argent during the spring of 1882 from the Acad√©mie des Jeux floraux in Toulouse for her ballad La Belle au Bois dormant (the sleeping beauty), but was so shy that she could not read it in public. Her library was rather tiny, and only consisted of some magazines, a few historical books, and 'la l√©gende des si√®cles' by Victor Hugo. She did not imitate anybody's style in her verses, but presented herself truly and na√Øvely. Her piety was sincere and without affectation. She looked after poor or ill people devotedly, and called on a sick woman just four days before dying; even her parents ignored this self-sacrificing. She died as she lived, silently.

It is based on a true story. The film premiered on the Lifetime television network in 2004. Plot Michelle Brown (Paisley) is a young woman who buys her first house and has an excellent credit history. As she submits the paperwork to the mortgage lender, one of the employees, Connie Volkos (Sciorra), uses Michelle's credit card number, social security number and address to purchase numerous items, including electronics and other luxuries. Eventually, this gets out of hand to the point that Michelle begins to suspect her identity has been stolen after receiving bills for items she had not paid for. Connie flees her apartment and travels through the country, dying her hair brown and obtaining a false driver license in Michelle's name. After reaching a different state she purchases her own apartment. Within a matter of months, Connie is arrested for attempting to deliver marijuana and flees the jurisdiction after her brother puts up her bail. Coincidentally, Michelle has traveled to the southern United States to observe another school and their teaching methods, but because Connie is still using Michelle's name, Michelle is arrested and detained at an airport. She is later released after Ray explains her predicament. Connie is later arrested and is sentenced to two years in prison for her crimes. Because of the lack of regulations against identity theft at the time, she does not face as severe of charges as an identity thief today would. Yet, this case caused reforms in the United States' laws to increase regulations against identity theft.

Hakim Safdar Hamdani in his book Shian-e-Kashmir has termed him as a Mard-e-Mujahid or an Islamic warrior while others, like Syed Kazimi, has described him as a man who had a hidden and heavenly helping hand behind him. Ayatollah Aqa Syed Ahmed Rizvi Kashmiri  Early life  Ayatollah Aqa Syed Ahmed Rizvi Kashmiri was born at Nabidpore-Zadibal area of Srinagar city in Indian Administrated Kashmir, in a revered religious and pious family and was a descendant of Shi'ite eighth Imam Ali al-Rizha, the son of Imam Musa al-Kadhim through one of the great saints and religious propagators Mir Aqa Syed Hussein Rizvi Qommi, who went to Kashmir from Qom, Iran in the year 821 A.H., during the reign of Sultan Sikander who appointed him as mentor of his son Sultan Zain- ul-Abidin locally known as Budshah.Encyclopedia of Shi‚Äôtes in Kashmir (Urdu), Vol. I by Syed Mohsin Hussaini Kashmiri: Published by, The Indian Sub- continental Literal Revival Centre, Karachi, Pakistan. Haaj Aqa Syed Hussein Rizvi (d. 1942), father of Ayatollah Syed Ahmed Rizvi Kashmiri, was a learned and well known preacher of his time who was famous by name of Mir Haji Hussein. He, along with some other members of his family, used to travel to Skardu, Baltistan, Yarkand and adjoining areas on business trips and besides doing business preached Islam. He was famously known in Skardu, Baltistan as Mir or Master. His descendants, who preferred to settle down there, are still remembered and revered as family of Ba‚Äômir. Haaj Aqa Syed Hassan or Mir Syed Hassan (d. 1928), uncle of Ayatollah Aqa Syed Ahmed Rizvi, was also a well known Islamic scholar, preacher and a spiritual figure who had established a Husseiniyeh or a shrine for commemoration of the Martyrdom of Imam Hussein near his residence in Srinagar. The arranging of gatherings for observing the Martyrdom of Imam Hussein was an ancestral practice prevalent in the family since hundreds of years. The practice prevails even to this time and people gather on the same place to remember the Martyrs of Karbala, which was later- on established by Haaj Aqa Hassan and is famous as Shrine of Haaj Syed Hassan or Mir Hassan. Mir Syed Hassan himself is buried in the said Shrine. The family especially Mir Haaj Syed Hassan Rizvi and Mir Haaj Syed Hussein Rizvi, like their ancestors, had devoted themselves for disseminating the true features and knowledge of the religion of Islam. Ayatollah Aqa Syed Ahmed Rizvi Kashmiri  Genealogy  (Ayatollah) Syed Ahmed son of Syed Hussein son of Syed Muhammad son of Syed Baqar son of Syed Rehmatullah son of Syed Mohammad son of Syed Hidayatullah son of Syed Saleh (Haigam)This great grandfather of Ayatollah Aqa Syed Ahmed Rizvi Kashmiri appears to be the same Aqa Syed Saleh, who was residing in Haigam area of Baramulla in Kashmir and was a grand scholar of his time, who had also written Marsiyeh or dirge in Kashmiri in the memory of Imam Hussein, the Shiite third Imam who was martyred mercilessly in Karbala. This Aqa Saleh is reportedly buried in Kabul, Afghanistan. His great grandson, Aqa Syed Safdar went to Lucknow along with his son Aqa Syed Ali, famously known as Aqa Syed Ali Rizvi Kashmiri. Aqa Syed Ali got educated from Najaf and Karbala in Iraq and was great intellectual, an Ayatollah and a renowned jurist, whose son Ayatollah Syed Abul Hassan Rizvi Kashmiri (Abu Sahab) is credited of having established well-known Shi'ite Islamic School Sultan-ul-Madaris and also helped in establishing the school of Jamia Eimaniyeh, both in Lucknow. This Aqa Syed Ali Kashmiri was also the maternal grand father of great Gnostic and jurist, Ayatollah Syed Murtazha Rizvi Kashmiri. A number of great personalities and Islamic jurists were his descendants, who lived in Lucknow, India. Many of them lived and are buried in Karbala and Najaf in Iraq.References: Oe‚Äôsh te‚Äô A‚Äôab [Kashmiri Language] (Selection of Kashmiri Marsiyah from period of Sultans to Dogra Rule) November, 2009: Pub: Skyline Publications Pvt.

From Lucknow, he went for further studies to the city of Najaf in Iraq, which has remained as the centre of Shitte Islamic seminaries and focus of spiritual subjects for almost fourteen hundred years. In Najaf, he studied in Islamic Seminaries under the prominent scholars and well-known jurists for more than twenty years, attending the lectures of Jurisprudence of Grand Ayatollah Mohammad Hussain Na'ini, Grand Ayatollah Aqa Abul Hassan Isfahani, Grand Ayatollah Syed Hussain Qommi, Grand Ayatollah Aqa Zia-ud-Din Iraqi and many other leading Grand Ayatollahs of that period and, thence, attained the degree of Ijtihad while passing through the heights and zenith of knowledge and character. He learned from the legendary jurists and scholars of Islamic World of his period in Iran, Iraq, Syria and Palestine but he was very much eager to learn and practice spiritual aspects of Islam. Here, his fellow students included Grand Ayatollah Aqa Syed Abul Qasim Khoie, Grand Ayatollah Asadullah Madani, Grand Ayatollah Murtazha al-Khalkhali, Grand Ayatollah Syed Ali Naqai Naqvi (Molvi Naqqan), Allamah Tabataba'I, Ayatollah Syed Abdul Karim Rizvi Kashmiri, etc. Ayatollah Syed Ahmed Rizvi's spiritual education was provided by one of the brightest Spiritual figures of the twentieth century and teacher of Knowledge of Islamic spiritualism, Ali Tabatabaei,ÿ≥€åÿØ ÿπŸÑ€å ŸÇÿßÿ∂€å - Ÿà€å⁄©€å‚ÄåŸæÿØ€åÿß who is considered to be the illustrious and grandest personality of Shiite Gnosticism.ÿ≥€åÿØ ÿπŸÑ€å ŸÇÿßÿ∂€å - Ÿà€å⁄©€å‚ÄåŸæÿØ€åÿß He remained also under the guidance of Ayatollah Muhammad Hussein Kampani for some time. Ali Tabatabaei had himself reached the pinnacle of spirituality and had traversed the highest stations of sair-o-salook (spiritualism). His students included Abul Qasim Khoei, Grand Ayatollah Syed Ruhullah Khoemini, Muhammad Husayn Tabatabaei, Mohammad-Taqi Bahjat Foumani, Abdul Karim Rizvi Kashmiri, Syed Hashim Hadad, Martyred Ayatollah Dastegaib. Imam Khomeini termed Syed Ali Qadhi as the best teacher of Metaphysics in Islam, as he express;- \\"When it comes to cognition of (hidden meanings of) Tawheed, (Ayatollah) Qadhi emerges as a mountain\\" The spiritual development of Ayatollah Syed Ahmed Rizvi Kashmiri reached the culmination under the supervision of his spiritual guide, Ali Tabatabaei. Aqa Ahmed Kashmiri is said to have attained the level and ability of moving soul outside his material body and returning in spiritual workout. He was a renowned religious and spiritual personality (Sahebi Karameh) and, in Kashmir, hundreds of spiritual and miraculous events had been reported about him. Ayatollah Syed Abdul Karim Kashmiri has described him as the strongest disciple of Ayatollah Qadhi while giving him title of Qadhi Saa‚Äôni or Second Qadhi, seconding him to none other than the masterly Gnostic, Ayatollah Syed Qadhi Ali Tabatabai. At another place, Ayatollah Syed Abdul Karim Kashmiri has mentioned him as a great man and a strong (spiritual personality), who remained confined to his room and had idealistic manners., It has also been reported that Ali Tabatabaei had himself described Aqa Syed Ahmed Rizvi Kashmiri to be his strongest disciple.Shining Sun - In the Memory of Allamah Tabataba'i (A Translation of Mihr-i-Taban by Ayatullah Sayyid Muhammad Husayn Husayni Tihrani) Translated by Tawus Raja; London: ICAS Press; Pages 19, 364, 421 Ayatollah Syed Ahmed Kashmiri returned to Kashmir, where he continued his mission of disseminating Islamic message for years and brought a new change in practical Islamic education of Kashmir. Aqa established a Seminary MADRASSA MOHAMMADIA in the Capital of Kashmir, Srinagar, where students learned under the best teachers of Kashmir, but his death was a blow to this educational center. He also used to give lectures on Juristic laws to gatherings of people on every Thursday night and Friday morning at his residence. All the sects of Kashmiri society had a great deal of attachment to Ahmed Rizvi. The then Prime Minister of Jammu and Kashmir, Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah, was very much influenced by Ayatollah Syed Ahmed Rizvi that he usually visited Aqa Rizvi's home for spiritual lessons and had desired to become one of his pupils and even after death of Ayatollah Syed Ahmed used to come to his burial. Ayatollah Aqa Ahmed traveled far flung areas to educate the masses and to spread the teachings of Islam.  Spiritual powers and miracles  It is said once a person named Ghulam Hussein Makhmoor, who was a government official posted at Jammu almost three hundred kilometers away from Srinagar City, had posted a letter to Ayatollah Aqa Syed Ahmed, seeking instructions from him in a complicated matter. He was expecting reply to his letter would come from Ayatollah Ahmed Kashmiri in more than a week's time keeping in consideration the transportation and postal facilities of those days. But he was astounded when he found reply to his letter at his bed, on the same evening and that too in the room, the windows of which were closed and the door of which he had himself locked from outside earlier in the day while leaving for office.Imamiyah Jurisprudence Sources: by Syed Mudasir Hassan Rizvi Kashmiri (Author of the Book is grandson of Ayatollah Aqa Syed Ahmad Kashmiri) It has been reported that when Ayatollah Aqa Ahmed Kashmiri was operated upon in a Hospital in Srinagar, the doctors who were performing the surgery were surprised over what they had seen. As per the doctors, all the vital organs of Aqa Syed Ahmad Kashmiri had been damaged but in spite of that he was alive. The condition of the organs was such that he should have had died several years earlier. Subsequently, groups of doctors would visit Ayatollah Aqa Syed Ahmad Kashmiri to pay their respect till he was alive.  Death  Ayatollah Aqa Syed Ahmed Rizvi died on Thursday the 28th of Safar 1384 Hijri (9 July 1964) at his residence in Srinagar after concluding the congregational- gathering commemorating the departure of Muhammad and martyrdom of Shiite second Imam Hassan the son of Imam Ali.

We find the matrix of eigenvectors \\\\mathbf{P}=\\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\mathbf{p}_1 & \\\\cdots & \\\\mathbf{p}_n \\\\end{bmatrix} and the diagonal matrix \\\\mathbf{D} of eigenvalues \\\\\\\\{\\\\lambda_1, \\\\cdots , \\\\lambda_n \\\\\\\\} sorted by decreasing order such that: :\\\\mathbf{P}^{\\\\mathrm{T}} \\\\mathbf{R}_1 \\\\mathbf{P} = \\\\mathbf{D} and :\\\\mathbf{P}^{\\\\mathrm{T}} \\\\mathbf{R}_2 \\\\mathbf{P} = \\\\mathbf{I}_n with \\\\mathbf{I}_n the identity matrix. This is equivalent to the eigendecomposition of \\\\mathbf{R}_2^{-1} \\\\mathbf{R}_1: :\\\\mathbf{R}_2^{-1} \\\\mathbf{R}_1=\\\\mathbf{PDP}^{-1} :\\\\mathbf{w}^\\\\text{T} will correspond to the first column of \\\\mathbf{P}: :\\\\mathbf{w}=\\\\mathbf{p}_1^\\\\text{T}  Discussion = Relation between variance ratio and eigenvalue  The eigenvectors composing \\\\mathbf{P} are components with variance ratio between the two windows equal to their corresponding eigenvalue: : \\\\mathbf{\\\\lambda}_i = \\\\frac{ \\\\left\\\\ \\\\mathbf{p}_i^\\\\text{T} \\\\mathbf{X}_1 \\\\right\\\\ ^2 }{ \\\\left\\\\ \\\\mathbf{p}_i^\\\\text{T} \\\\mathbf{X}_2 \\\\right\\\\ ^2 }  Other components  The vectorial subspace E_i generated by the i first eigenvectors \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\mathbf{p}_1 & \\\\cdots & \\\\mathbf{p}_i \\\\end{bmatrix} will be the subspace maximizing the variance ratio of all components belonging to it: :E_i={\\\\arg \\\\max}_{E} \\\\begin{pmatrix}\\\\min_{p \\\\in E} \\\\frac{ \\\\left\\\\ \\\\mathbf{p^\\\\text{T} X}_1 \\\\right\\\\ ^2 }{ \\\\left\\\\ \\\\mathbf{p^\\\\text{T} X}_2 \\\\right\\\\ ^2}\\\\end{pmatrix} On the same way, the vectorial subspace F_j generated by the j last eigenvectors \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\mathbf{p}_{n-j+1} & \\\\cdots & \\\\mathbf{p}_n \\\\end{bmatrix} will be the subspace minimizing the variance ratio of all components belonging to it: : F_j = {\\\\arg \\\\min}_{F} \\\\begin{pmatrix}\\\\max_{p \\\\in F} \\\\frac{ \\\\left\\\\ \\\\mathbf{p^\\\\text{T} X}_1 \\\\right\\\\ ^2 }{ \\\\left\\\\ \\\\mathbf{p^\\\\text{T} X}_2 \\\\right\\\\ ^2} \\\\end{pmatrix}  Variance or second-order moment  CSP can be applied after a mean subtraction (a.k.a. \\"mean centering\\") on signals in order to realize a variance ratio optimization. Otherwise CSP optimizes the ratio of second-order moment.  Choice of windows X1 and X2  * The standard use consists on choosing the windows to correspond to two periods of time with different activation of sources (e.g. during rest and during a specific task). * It is also possible to choose the two windows to correspond to two different frequency bands in order to find components with specific frequency pattern.S. Boudet, \\"Filtrage d'artefacts par analyse multicomposantes de l'√©lectroencephalogramme de patients √©pileptiques.\\", PhD. Thesis: Unviversit√© de Lille 1, 07/2008 Those frequency bands can be on temporal or on frequential basis. Since the matrix \\\\mathbf{P} depends only of the covariance matrices, the same results can be obtained if the processing is applied on the Fourier transform of the signals. * Y. Wang Y. Wang, \\"Reduction of cardiac artifacts in magnetoencephalogram.\\" Proc. of the 12th Int. Conf. on Biomagnetism, 2000 has proposed a particular choice for the first window \\\\mathbf{X}_1 in order to extract components which have a specific period. \\\\mathbf{X}_1 was the mean of the different periods for the examined signals. * If there is only one window, \\\\mathbf{R}_2 can be considered as the identity matrix and then CSP corresponds to Principal component analysis.  Applications  This method can be applied to several multivariate signals but it seems that most works on it concern electroencephalographic signals. Particularly, the method is mostly used on brain‚Äìcomputer interface in order to retrieve the component signals which best transduce the cerebral activity for a specific task (e.g. hand movement).G. Pfurtscheller, C. Guger and H. Ramoser \\"EEG-based brain-computer interface using subject-specific spatial filters\\", Engineering applications of bio- inspired artificial neural networks, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 1999, Vol. 1607/1999, pp. 248-254 It can also be used to separate artifacts from electroencephalographics signals. The common spatial pattern needs to be adapted for the analysis of the event-related potentials.M. Congedo, L. Korczowski, A. Delorme and F.

Adalah's goals are \\"achieving individual and collective rights of the Arab-Palestinian minority in Israel\\" and protecting \\"the human rights of Palestinians living under occupation, based on international humanitarian law and international human rights law\\". The organization was founded in November 1996; it is non-partisan and not-for- profit. Adalah's founder and General Director is lawyer Hassan Jabareen. Adalah means Justice in the Arabic language. Mission and philosophy Adalah attempts to influence Israeli public discourse through media outreach and campaigning. Adalah regularly participates in Israeli and international academic conferences.Payes, Shany, 'Palestinian NGOs in Israel: The Politics of Civil Society'(2005), pg 124 Historian Ilan Pappe describes Adalah's philosophy as \\"that the personal autonomy of the individual was a right that had to be fiercely protected, and that this right included also the collective rights of the group to which the individual belonged.\\"Pappe, Ilan, 'The Forgotten Palestinians: A History of the Palestinians in Israel'(2011), pg 208  Legal advocacy  Many of Adalah's cases involve first-time legal challenges and affect Arab citizens as a collective group. Adalah's legal advocacy focuses on appealing to the Israeli Supreme Court. Between 1996‚Äì2000, it brought over twenty cases before the court dealing with equality for Arab citizens, including language rights cases, budgets of the Ministry of Religious Affairs, health and education in the unrecognized Arab Bedouin villages in Israel. Adalah's legal department is divided into three units: Land and Planning; Economic, Social, and Cultural; and Civil and Political (including Criminal Justice and the Occupied Palestinian Territory).  International advocacy  Adalah's international advocacy work focuses on United Nations human rights bodies, European Union bodies, embassies/foreign diplomats based in Israel, and cooperating with international human rights organizations and networks. Adalah has conducted regular interventions to UN Committees in its reviews of Israel's compliance with human rights conventions. Adalah and its partners played a leading role in the passing of an EU Parliament Resolution on 5 July 2012 condemning Israel's practice of forced displacement against Palestinian Arabs in the Occupied Territory (West Bank and East Jerusalem) and in the Naqab (Negev) in Israel. October 2000 events and the Or Commission In October 2000, Israeli security forces used live ammunition and rubber-coated bullets against Palestinian Arab citizens at demonstrations, killing 13 people. A Commission of Inquiry was established and Adalah represented the family members of the 13 Palestinian citizens of Israel killed by the police, and the Arab political leaders who received warnings from the Commission. The Or Commission found that there was no justification whatsoever for the excessive use of lethal forced that caused the deaths of 13 Palestinian citizens of Israel. It found that in October 2000 snipers were used to disperse demonstrations for the first time since 1948, and that this sniper fire, which led to the death and injury of citizens, was illegal and certainly not grounded in the internal regulations of the police governing the use of live fire. Similarly, the Or Commission determined that the firing of rubber-coated steel bullets, which produced fatal results, was also contrary to the internal police. Unrecognized Arab Bedouin villages By the 1990s, there were about 45 Arab Bedouin villages in the Naqab (Negev) that were not officially recognized by the state, even though many of these villages had existed before the state's establishment or residents were moved there by the state itself during the 1950s. Because of their ‚Äúunrecognized‚Äù status, these villages do not receive basic services such as water, healthcare, schools, safe roads and others. In December 1997, Adalah represented 12 of the largest unrecognized villages in the Negev ‚Äúin a demand for the establishment of basic medical clinics‚Äù, where mothers and children seeking treatment had to travel long distances with no public transportation in order to access a health facility. The Bedouin villages in the Naqab have the highest rate of infant mortality in the country as well as the lowest level of immunization.Pappe, Ilan, \\"The Forgotten Palestinians: A History of the Palestinians in Israel\\" (2011), pg 210 By the mid-2000s ten of the 45 villages were accepted by the state as being ‚Äúin the process of recognition‚Äù. However, the state has not provided full services entailed by that recognition and Adalah continues to pressure the government to fulfill its commitments to these villages. The Prawer plan Stopping the implementation of the ‚ÄúLaw for the Regulation of Bedouin Settlement in the Negev‚Äù (the ‚ÄúPrawer plan‚Äù) is a legislative focus of Adalah. According to human rights groups, the Plan will oversee the demolitions of 35 unrecognized Bedouin villages in the Naqab and the forced relocation of 40,000‚Äì70,000 Bedouin citizens to recognized townships. Adalah is representing several villages before the courts to challenge their eviction and demolition orders, including the villages of Umm el-Hieran and Atir, which are to be destroyed to build a Jewish town and a forest on their locations respectively. Adalah regularly submits petitions and letters in partnership with other NGOs and civil society groups, such as the Association for Civil Rights in Israel, Bimkom, the Negev Co-Existence Forum, and the Regional Council of Unrecognized Villages.  Current cases  Among others, Adalah is currently involved in the following legal cases: * Representing Arab MK Mohammed Barakeh (Democratic Front for Peace and Equality - Hadash) on a criminal indictment charging him with four alleged offenses of assaulting or insulting police officers resulting from his participation in anti-Wall and anti-War demonstrations between 2005 and 2007. The court accepted Adalah's arguments concerning parliamentary immunity, and dismissed two of four charges in 10/11. * Representing residents of Al-Araqib and human rights activists on criminal indictments related to protest activities concerning the repeated demolition of the Arab Bedouin village of Al-Araqib in the Naqab. * Demanding the cancellation of an Israel Land Administration (ILA) policy permitting the marketing and allocation of Jewish National Fund (JNF)-controlled lands by the ILA through bids open only to Jewish Individuals. * Seeking the cancellation of evacuation lawsuits against about 1,000 Arab Bedouin citizens of Israel living in the unrecognized village of Atir-Umm el-Hieran in the Naqab and demanding its recognition by the state. * Petitioning the Supreme Court on behalf of Gaza residents and Palestinian and Israeli human rights organizations challenging the ban on Palestinian residents of Gaza from entering Israel to access the courts for tort damages cases filed against the Israeli security forces. The state's prevention of entry is resulting in the dismissal of hundreds of compensation lawsuits. In effect, the state is exempting itself from all damages claims. * Petitioned the High Court of Justice and government ministries to publish public health information regarding Coronavirus disease 2019 in Arabic. Government ministries acknowledged their failure and at last began publishing in Arabic, though they continue to publish more detailed information in Hebrew than in Arabic.

In 1793 he joined the 2nd Grand Kinbourn Dragoon Regiment to help put down the Ko≈õciuszko Uprising. He and his father fought in the battle on the Matsiovitsa Hill and the assault on the heavily fortified Prague suburb of Warsaw and rose to commander and lieutenant colonel. He was granted the Order of St George 4th class on 1 January 1795 In 1796 he fought in the Persian campaign under Valerian Zubov's command at the head of a cossack regiment. On returning from Persia he transferred to the Strarodubov Cuirassier Regiment. He rose to colonel in 1798 but left the army because of illness the same year. The following year he returned to the Strarodubov Regiment under Alexander Rimski-Korsakov's command on its departure for Switzerland and the War of the Second Coalition. He was wounded at the Second Battle of Zurich and rose to general and commander of the Riazan Cuirassier Regiment. In 1800 the regiment was disbanded but he was given the right to continue wearing its uniform. Alexander I's accession allowed him to take command of the 3rd Elizavetgrad Guards Hussar Regiment in 1802. He took part in the War of the Fourth Coalition and fought against the French at Blonav and on 11 December 1806 at Tchanow near Modlin. He was before Alexander Ostermann-Tolstoy's corps and repulsed all the French assaults, keeping his unit together and finally carrying out a bayonet charge, though he himself was wounded in the arm. He was granted the Order of St George 3rd class on 31 January 1807. At Pulstuk and Eylau he was put in command of three dragoon regiments and two hussar regiments. He was then given the Order of St Vladimir 3rd class. At Friedland he saved two captured batteries, for which he was given the Order of St Anne 1st class.
