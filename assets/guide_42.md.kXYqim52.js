The film stars Margot Robbie alongside an ensemble cast, featuring Simon Pegg, Dexter Fletcher, Max Irons, and Mike Myers. The plot follows the intertwining lives of two assassins, a fatally ill teacher, a janitor and a waitress, all of whom become part of an evil mastermind's murderous plan. The film is an international co-production between Ireland, the United Kingdom, Hungary, Hong Kong and the United States. Principal photography took place in Budapest, Hungary during May 2016. Terminal was released in the United States on 11 May 2018, by RLJE Films. The film premiered in the United Kingdom on 26 June 2018 at the Edinburgh International Film Festival as part of the American Dreams Strand. It was released theatrically in the United Kingdom and Ireland on 6 July 2018 by Arrow Films. The film received generally negative reviews from critics, who criticised the plot, narrative, pacing and direction, though some praised Robbie's performance and the visual style. It was also a box office bomb grossing mere $626,799. Plot A young woman meets a mysterious employer in a confession booth, and implores him to employ her as his sole contract killer. To prove her worth, she offers to eliminate his other contractors. In exchange for her efforts, she asks if he can find someone for her. Bill is standing on a deserted train platform, and is told by a limping janitor that no trains will be coming until 4:04 in the morning. The janitor suggests he wait in the 24 hour cafe. There, he converses with Annie, a waitress, who notices that he has a terminal disease, and is suicidal. She discusses various ways he can kill himself. Later, Illing, a hitman, is captured by Annie, who is posing as a prostitute. He awakes to find himself handcuffed to a bed before Annie incapacitates and kills him. Mr. Franklyn, the employer, calls his two hitmen and orders them to pick up a briefcase from the lockers at the terminal. They take it to the cafe, and find a pack of matches and an envelope of money. They wonder why Mr. Franklyn has called on them, and not Illing. The match pack is from a strip joint, where they find a dancer resembling the waitress Annie from earlier. She takes the envelope of money as payment for passing on information about the hit Mr. Franklyn wants them to do. She comes on strong to Alfred, but is dismissive of Vince. The hitmen are told to wait in an apartment, and to shoot a person in the window opposite when told. Vince is also secretly told via a phone call to then kill Alfred. The waitress tells Alfred that Vince will try to kill him, so Alfred should kill Vince once the hit is completed. Mr. Franklyn watches from his lair, with monitors displaying camera footage of the cafe and the hitmen's hideout. Back at the train terminal, the waitress takes Bill to an abandoned air shaft, and tries to talk him into committing suicide. Although he described throwing himself down a deep, dark hole as his final act, he cannot jump. The waitress teases him, and Bill tells the waitress that she is a \\"naughty girl\\". This triggers a memory from his days as a school teacher, where he had two girls in his class that he abused. The waitress reveals that she is one of those girls, and then she stabs Bill in the neck with his pen, and pushes him down the shaft. Meanwhile, Mr. Franklyn calls the hitmen's apartment, and says that they should be ready to take the shot. When Annie appears at the window across the apartment, Alfred pulls his gun on Vince. Annie comes over, and they shoot Vince. Alfred and Annie leave the apartment and run into the janitor, who is arriving to clean up the murder scene. Back in the terminal, the waitress turns on Alfred, tells him that she is not infatuated with him, and shoots him dead. The janitor comes along to clean up the body. The waitress decides to help the janitor take the bodies to the top of the air shaft and drop them both into it. The janitor returns to the terminal, and enters the janitor closet, which is actually Mr. Franklyn's control centre. He is revealed to be Mr. Franklyn in disguise, removing his prosthetic bad teeth and fake latex skin. He stops limping and walks normally. There are dozens of attach√© cases lined up for future jobs. As he leaves his \\"closet\\", he is accosted by the waitress and her doppelg√§nger, revealed to be a set of twins, Annie and Bonnie. The twins tie up Mr. Franklyn and describe how their mother died. She was being pursued by her partner, revealed to be Mr. Franklyn, after she witnessed him murder someone and ran back to her flat to protect her twin girls. Mr. Franklyn poured gasoline in her home, and set it on fire. The mother had time to push the girls out a broken window, but could not save herself. After that, the twins spent the rest of their childhood in an orphanage being molested by Bill. The twins tell Mr. Franklyn that he is their biological father and they are ready to exact their revenge. They lobotomise him, finally kill him, then walk out of the terminal together.

Reception Terminal received generally negative reviews from critics, with many criticising the plot, pacing, direction and narrative, though Robbie's performance and the film's visual style and production values received praise. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 21% based on 66 reviews, and an average rating of 4.26/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Worth seeking out for only the most hardcore of Margot Robbie completists, Terminal lives down to the medical definition of its title in dreadfully derivative fashion.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 27 out of 100, based on 20 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". Rolling Stones Peter Travers panned the film, awarding zero stars, stating, \\"The title of this wretched Tarantino-meets- Blade Runner noir rip-off doubles as a diagnosis\\". Rex Reed of the New York Observer also awarded zero stars, calling the film \\"a turgid, pretentious, and incomprehensible existential joke.\\" David Edelstein of Vulture gave a negative review, criticising the plot's focus, saying, \\"since the film doesn't establish a baseline of reality, it's hard to pick out a premise.\\" David Ehrlich of IndieWire gave the film a D, writing, \\"Vaughn Stein's Terminal takes a mess of dead tropes and Frankensteins them together into a crime saga that's in desperate need of brains. And a soul. And a story.\\" Jacob Knight of Birth.Movies.Death. heavily criticised Stein's direction and wrote, \\"no amount of pretty pictures could save a script this abysmally written. Stein has penned scene after scene after scene of nasty people talking circles around one another, no character defined by anything beyond their comic book-ready aesthetic.\\" Jeffrey M. Anderson of The San Francisco Examiner awarded the film two and a half stars out of four, describing the film as \\"mediocre\\", though praising Robbie's performance, writing, \\"Robbie is a bright one, and even though Terminal isn't much, it offers a chance to watch her shine.\\" Clint Worthington of Consequence of Sound heavily criticised Stein's direction, calling the film a \\"waste of time\\" and \\"An entirely empty exercise in dated, exhausting hyper-stylized filmmaking.\\" Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times praised the film, awarding three out of four stars, writing, \\"The final 15 minutes or so of Terminal are flat-out nutso. One can imagine Robbie, Myers et al., breaking into laughter after hearing \\"Cut!\\" ‚Äî not out of disrespect for the material, but out of sheer giddiness for having the opportunity to try something so audacious. Even when it doesn't work, Terminal is a film with never a dull moment.\\" Kenneth Seward Jr. of IGN gave a mostly positive review, scoring the film a 7.5 out of 10, indicating it is \\"Good\\", stating, \\"Terminal is an interesting revenge story that mostly works. There are a few missteps, namely a few wasted characters and a straight forward plot made needlessly complicated. Still, Vaughn Stein should be pleased with what's here.\\" Colin Covert of the Minneapolis Star Tribune gave a highly positive review, awarding three and a half out of four stars, praising the film's visual style, noting, \\"Every moment of Terminal engages the eye, and ‚Äî unexpectedly ‚Äî the mind. Even the makeup is arresting ‚Äî the arterial red of Annie's lipstick is hypnotic.\\" James Berardinelli of Reelviews gave a mixed review, awarding the film two and a half stars out of four, writing, \\"At its best, Terminal is a tasty, tangy parfait ‚Äì a kaleidoscope of neon-tinged visuals and a twisty storyline with a tortured timeline.\\" However, he criticised the film's ending as \\"generic\\" and \\"anticlimactic\\". John DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter gave a mostly negative review criticising Stein's direction, writing, \\"An airless debut that says much about its writer-director's cultural diet and little about anything else in the world, Vaughn Stein's Terminal blends tropes from several sorts of crime flicks into a soundstagey affair that's more brittle than hard-boiled.\\" Jeannette Catsoulis of The New York Times also gave a negative review, calling the film \\"a flashy, hyperstylized bore.\\" Shaun Munro of Flickering Myth gave a mostly positive review, stating, \\"It's messy and navel-gazingly ostentatious, but fitfully entertaining thanks largely to a scene-stealing, against-type performance from Simon Pegg.\\"  References   External links   2018 films 2018 crime thriller films American crime thriller films American films American films about revenge American neo-noir films British crime thriller films British films British films about revenge British neo-noir films Films about contract killing Films about twin sisters Films produced by David Barron Films produced by Margot Robbie Films shot in Budapest Hong Kong crime thriller films Hong Kong films Hong Kong films about revenge Hong Kong neo-noir films Hungarian crime thriller films Hungarian films Irish crime thriller films Irish films LuckyChap Entertainment films Patricide in fiction ","title":"Terminal (2018 film)"},{"id":"51127400","text":"Basil Rawdon Jackson (20 May 1892 ‚Äì 29 March 1957) was a British businessman, chairman of BP from February 1956 to June 1957.

George Miller (1764 ‚Äì 6 October 1848) was an Irish Anglican priest and historian of Trinity College, Dublin. He developed a course in modern European history at the college after being passed-over for a professorship and appointed assistant to Francis Hodgkinson, professor of modern history at the college, who gave no lectures during his 41-year tenure. Miller's college lectures were published in eight parts between 1816 and 1828 and reissued in four volumes in 1832 as History, philosophically illustrated, from the fall of the Roman Empire, to the French Revolution, which went through three editions. Early life and education George Miller was born in 1764. He held three earned degrees from Trinity College\\"An Irishman's view of universities\\", Garland Downum History of Education Quarterly Vol. 3, No. 4 (Dec. 1963), pp. 210‚Äì214. including doctor of divinity (DD). Academic career Trinity College Library, Dublin, by James Malton (1761‚Äì1803). Miller was elected a fellow of Trinity College, Dublin, in 1789. In 1790, he was elected a member of the Royal Irish Academy and was later a member of the Council of that organisation and a secretary.\\"Report of the Council, March 16, 1849\\", Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy, Vol. 4 (1847‚Äì1850), pp. 309‚Äì313.

John Kearney, provost of the college, whose brother Michael Kearney had enjoyed great success by writing and publishing four lectures on the government of Rome, suggested to Miller that he do something similar in the field of modern history. As a result, Miller developed a lecture series on modern European history that found an audience \\"more remarkable for its intelligence than its numbers\\" at first but which gradually grew in popularity until it had to be delivered in the Examination Hall.\\"Trinity College in 1830 (Part III)\\", R.B.

Bohn. pp. iii‚Äìviii. however, later commentators have described the lecturers as \\"pietistic\\" and Miller devoted considerable space in the preface to the four volume edition (1832) to a description of the method by which he reconciled the more unpleasant parts of historical fact with his religious faith, arguing that he was: > \\"not required by his theory to vindicate, or to censure, any transaction, > all being according to it, conducive, directly or indirectly, to the same > end ... He had only to endeavour to show how each transaction has been by > its consequences a part of a combined whole, having for its general issue > the improvement of human society; how each leading individual, whatever may > have been the motive, or the quality of his conduct, was an agent, though > free and unconscious, in the execution of the plan of a wise and beneficent > providence.\\" Miller's approach has been described as being in the Providential tradition and a review in The Dublin University Magazine in 1839 noted that \\"Dr. Miller advances and establishes his great principles, that God reigneth in the affairs of men, and that the end of the divine government is man's improvement\\"\\"Modern history philosophically considered\\", The Dublin University Magazine, Vol. XIII (May 1839), pp. 571‚Äì579. while The Edinburgh Review in 1830, referring to the first edition, understood Miller's premise to be that \\"all the events of this world have an intrinsic connexion\\" and that \\"the study of human events, as well as of external nature, tends to illustrate the divine perfection\\" before entering into a detailed discussion of how the historian could reconcile the existence of evil in the world with God's omnipotence.Review: \\"Lectures on the philosophy of modern history\\", The Edinburgh Review, January 1830, Vol. L, No. C, pp. 286‚Äì344. In May 1799, Miller wrote to Lord Castlereagh, Chief Secretary for Ireland in the British government,Vane, Charles. (1848) Memoirs and correspondence of Viscount Castlereagh, second marquess of Londonderry. Volume II. London: Henry Colburn. pp. 302‚Äì307. following rumours that the British government was to establish a new college at Armagh. In the letter, which was first published in Castlereagh's correspondence in 1848, Miller offered his views on the curriculum and form of studies that might be offered by such a college and compared and contrasted the universities of England, Scotland and Ireland, finding them all wanting in different respects. The college was never established and, as far as is known, Castlereagh did not reply to the letter, but it provides evidence of Miller's eclectic views on education and accounts of the form of university instruction current at the time. In 1804, Miller resigned his fellowship and took up a clerical living in County Fermanagh. He continued to deliver his history lectures until 1811 for which he received a salary of ¬£100 per annum. After they ceased, history lecturing also ceased at Trinity College for some time. His lectures were first published as Lectures on the philosophy of modern history in eight parts in Dublin between 1816 and 1828 and reissued in four volumes as History, philosophically illustrated, from the fall of the Roman Empire, to the French Revolution in London in 1832 which went through three editions. Clerical career Miller took up a clerical living in Derryvollan, County Fermanagh in 1804, subsequently becoming vicar general of Armagh and the headmaster of the school there. Death and legacy Miller died on 6 October 1848. His grandson was the Irish Anglican priest and historian Beaver Henry Blacker.\\"In memorium\\", by William George, Gloucestershire Notes and Queries, Vol. V.

Tanamor said, \\"During the interview, it was clear that in their minds they thought everyone was staring at them because they were beautiful, but then the juxtaposition was the majority of people who were going, 'What is that?'\\" He thought about why men would act out in this manner, chocking up that a death of a spouse may trigger this behavior.

The author was continually getting confused with his twin by random people ‚Äì mostly women ‚Äì and even his twin's own mother. The long drawn out process resulted in the novella about a straight, boring man who was continuously being mixed up for a gay, fabulous man. Tanamor stated that writing out the story was therapeutic.

Since I was a child, there was this secret obsession with having super powers,\\" Tanamor said.

After the cat brought in a headless bunny, Tanamor started sharing the kills on social media. \\"Part of the reason I started posting them was mainly to document our life in case he was practicing his craft,\\" he said.https://qconline.com/entertainment/book-about-serial-killer- cat-to-benefit-q-c-shelter/article_49af18ef-a48a-5199-9516-f9382957d94a.html \\"If Moo Moo decided to kill my wife and me, I at least wanted Facebook to know where to look first. When people say, 'It's always the boyfriend,' in this case, 'It's definitely the cat.'\\" When the posts became popular, Tanamor put them together and wrote a rhyming story around it. All the proceeds of the book go to the local shelter where Tanamor adopted Moo Moo. \\"I know how much help the shelters need,\\" he said. \\"I figure this would be a good way to donate to an important cause and make it fun.\\" Each book comes \\"paw-tographed\\" by Moo Moo.https://qconline.com/entertainment/book-about-serial-killer-cat-to- benefit-q-c-shelter/article_49af18ef-a48a-5199-9516-f9382957d94a.html  Bibliography  Vampires of Portlandia Drama Dolls Anonymous The Extraordinary Life of Shady Gray Hello Fabulous!

In 1762 and 1763, he gave the Th√©√¢tre-Fran√ßais two comedies with no success. He then published command works: tales, translations, philosophical tracts. The name of Dubois-Fontanelle came out of darkness when another of his plays, √âricie, ou la Vestale, fell under the scissors of censorship. Printed clandestinely, the play was presented in Lyon in 1768, resulting in the conviction of three unhappy peddlers to the galleys.

The current lighthouse built in 1986 is the third to have been constructed near to the town of Adra. The first was washed away, and the second was not tall enough to be distinguished from the lights of the town, and was replaced by the modern tower. History The first project to provide a beacon for Adra dates back to 1861, when the engineer Antonio Molina proposed to construct a light based on the screw pile design of Mitchell, similar to that of La Banya Lighthouse near Tarragona. His proposals were rejected, and instead a wooden tower was built to the east of the town, by the old mouth of the River Adra. It became operational in 1883, but the site was undermined by erosion, and in 1896 it was destroyed by a storm. A second lighthouse was then built nearer the town in 1899. Of similar construction to other 19th century Spanish lights, it had a lantern room on a short tower attached to the rear of a single storey keeper's house. The growth of the town, which included the construction of a harbour in 1910 began to cause problems with distinguishing the light from those of the surrounding buildings, which included the shot tower. The current light was built on a small promontory on the western side of the town in 1986, and consists of a concrete tower, with twin galleries. It has a distinctive daymark or red and white bands. With a focal height of above the sea, its light can be seen for 16 nautical miles, and has a characteristic of three flashes of white light every ten and a half seconds. It is registered under the international Admiralty number E0088 and has the NGA identifier of 113-4424, and is managed and operated by the Almer√≠a Port Authority.

It is headquartered on Naval Station Norfolk, and is commanded by RDML Charles W. Rock.  History of the Region  Navy Region Mid-Atlantic was formed from the former territories of the First, Second, Third, Fourth, and Fifth Naval Districts. The boundaries of the First Naval District, headquartered at Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine, (and later in Boston, Massachusetts), were established on 7 May 1903 in accordance with General Order No. 128, signed by Acting Secretary of the Navy Charles H. Darling. Until late 1915, no personnel were assigned to the district staff. In 1945 the district was headquartered at Boston and consisted of the following geographic areas: Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island (including Block Island). The First Naval District was disestablished on 7 October 1976 and control passed to the Fourth Naval District. Created with the other original districts in 1903, the Second Naval District was the smallest district. It was headquartered in Newport, Rhode Island, and covered only Rhode Island and adjacent waters. It was disestablished and its areas incorporated into the First and Third Districts on March 15, 1919, after the end of World War I. The Third Naval District, headquartered at New York, New York, was established on 7 May 1903 in accordance with General Order No. 128, signed by Acting Secretary of the Navy Charles H. Darling. Puerto Rico was initially part of the district, due to good communications between New York and Puerto Rico. In 1919 Puerto Rico was removed from the district and placed directly under the control of the Chief of Naval Operations. In 1945 the district, still headquartered at New York, consisted of the following geographic areas: Connecticut, New York, the northern part of New Jersey (including the counties of Mercer and Monmouth, and all counties north thereof), and also the Nantucket Shoals Lightship. The Third Naval District was disestablished on 7 October 1976 and functions were transferred to the Fourth Naval District. The boundaries of the Fourth Naval District, to be headquartered at League Island Navy Yard in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, were established on 7 May 1903 in accordance with General Order No. 128, signed by Acting Secretary of the Navy Charles H. Darling. No personnel were assigned to the district staff until late 1915. In 1945 the district, still headquartered in Philadelphia, consisted of the following geographic areas: Pennsylvania, the southern part of New Jersey (including the counties of Burlington and Ocean, and all counties south thereof), and Delaware (including Winter Quarters Shoal Light Vessel). On 7 October 1976 this command absorbed the functions of the First and Third Naval Districts. The Fourth Naval District was disestablished on 30 September 1980. The boundaries of the Fifth Naval District, to be headquartered at the Norfolk Navy Yard in Norfolk, Virginia, were established on 7 May 1903 in accordance with General Order No. 128, signed by Acting Secretary of the Navy Charles H. Darling. Until late 1915 no personnel were assigned to the district staff. In 1945 the district was headquartered at the Naval Operating Base at Norfolk, Virginia, and consisted of the following geographic areas: Maryland less Anne Arundel, Prince Georges, Montgomery, St. Mary's, Calvert, and Charles counties; West Virginia; Virginia less Arlington, Fairfax, Stafford, King George, Prince William, and Westmoreland counties; and the Counties of Currituck, Camden, Pasquotank, Gates, Perquimans, Chowan, Tyrrell, Washington, Hyde, Beaufort, Pamlico, Craven, Jones, Carteret, Onslow, and Dare in North Carolina; also the Diamond Shoals Lightship.

Life and work Born in Thuringia, Franz K√∂cher spent most of his scientific career in Berlin. He is primarily known for his magnum opus \\"Babylonisch-assyrische Medizin in Texten und Untersuchungen\\" (BAM).Markham J. Geller: Renal and Rectal Disease Texts. BAM 7 (2005), p. VII After finishing high school in Gera in 1936, K√∂cher did his undergraduate work in Ancient History, Near Eastern Philology (Orientalische Philologie) and Philosophy at the Friedrich-Schiller- Universit√§t of Jena. His studies were interrupted by his conscription into the Wehrmacht from October 1938 until the end of World War II. During this time he did manage to attend one semester in the winter of 1941/42 at the Friedrich- Wilhelms-University zu Berlin. After being taken as a prisoner of war by the US Army, he was released after a few weeks and worked as a teacher's assistant, until the University reopened in 1946 and K√∂cher was able to resume his studies. It was at this time that his teacher Erich Ebeling started to have a decisive impact on K√∂cher's scientific work. Ebeling was K√∂cher‚Äôs doctoral advisor for his doctorate, which was awarded in Assyriology, Near Eastern Philology (Orientalische Philologie) and Philosophy in March 1949. The subject of his dissertation was \\"Incantations against the demoness Lama≈°tu\\" (Beschw√∂rungen gegen die D√§monin Lama≈°tu). From May 1949 on, K√∂cher first worked as a research assistant and later, beginning in October 1952, as a research associate at the Institute for Oriental Studies (Institut f√ºr Orientforschung) of the Deutsche Akademie der Wissenschaften zu Berlin. Due to the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961, he was forced to abandon his work, since he lived in West Berlin and the Akademie was in the east. Because of his relentless work in the years prior to these events, K√∂cher had already laid the foundations of his afore mentioned magnum opus. His talent for making hand copies of cuneiform tables quickly became apparent when he assisted Erich Ebeling with his volume \\"Literarische Keilschrifttexte aus Assur\\" in 1953. K√∂cher was introduced to cuneiform medicine through, among others, the work on Ebeling's \\"Keilschrifttexte zur assyrisch-babylonischen Drogen- und Pflanzenheilkunde\\" in 1955, which was mostly focused on the pharmacological series URU AN.NA. He kept working on the series even long after his retirement.James Kinnier Wilson: The Assyrian Pharmaceutical Series URU.AN.NA : MA≈†TAKAL. In: Journal of Near Eastern Studies Vol. 64, No.1 (January 2005), pp. 45-52 Thanks to a scholarship awarded to him by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, he was able to continue his work on cuneiform medical texts from December 1961 onwards. In May 1963 K√∂cher became a research associate at the Institute for the History of Medicine (Institut f√ºr Geschichte der Medizin) at the Freie Universit√§t Berlin, where he would spend the remaining nineteen years of his career. After K√∂cher's habilitation in January 1967, he was granted the venia legendi by the Freie Universit√§t. Until his retirement in March 1983, he was a very active and dedicated teacher who had significant influence on many young physicians, historians and assyriologists alike. His magnum opus, \\"Die Babylonisch-Assyrische Medizin in Texten und Untersuchungen (BAM), was of paramount importance for K√∂cher throughout his entire career and is until today among the most important publications for the study of ancient Near Eastern medicine. Volumes 1 and 2 were published in 1963, volume 3 in 1964, volume 4 in 1971 and the volume 5 and in the year 1980. Volumes 7 and 8 are the work of Markham J.

Produced by Famous Studios and directed by Isadore Sparber, it was the 132nd cartoon in the Popeye series of theatrical cartoons released by Paramount Pictures. The cartoon has been criticized for its racist depictions of African-Americans.  Plot  Popeye, shipwrecked and riding a small raft, is overjoyed to come across a tropical island where Joe's Always Inn stands. He is received by Joe himself, who is in fact the king of the island's cannibal tribe. Seeing the delectable newcomer makes him visualize a meaty dish and, after Popeye is given service, Joe turns to his cookbook for ideas. To fatten him, he has the sailor rest comfortably on a hammock while being served various types of potato and starchy sweets. When a little cannibal tries to sandwich one of the guest's legs, Joe turns him away. Later, Joe says to Popeye he is to be initiated into the Secret Order of the Midnight Well. The ceremony involves Popeye taking a hot tub bath in the island clearing, at night. Drums sounding, Popeye enters the tub ‚Äì which is soon dismantled to reveal he is really in a large cauldron. After the young cannibal makes another sandwich out of Popeye's meaty arm, and takes a bite this time, the hero acknowledges his predicament as he sees every native is holding a meat ration book and looking at him hungrily. It takes a horde of natives to overcome Popeye's resistance. They then proceed to flatten him into the shape of a juicy steak ready to be grilled. The sailor-steak manages to get out and eat his spinach, promptly defeating all the tribesmen then going after Joe, who takes shelter in a building from which he shoots many cannons at the hero. Popeye turns his own projectiles against him, however. Joe is sent flying to the water, where two hungry sharks await, only he is hungrier and chases them over the sea. Popeye becomes the tribe's new king, although he has to put up with the boy cannibal trying a Popeye-leg sandwich once again.

Additionally, COMNAVREGSW is responsible for planning and coordinating Department of the Navy response to civil emergencies within the states of Nevada, Utah, Colorado, Arizona and California.  History  Navy Region Southwest comprises the former areas of the Eleventh and Twelfth Naval Districts. The Eleventh and Twelfth Naval Districts, were both established on 7 May 1903 in accordance with General Order No. 128, signed by Acting Secretary of the Navy Charles H. Darling. The Eleventh Naval District was to be headquartered at the Lake Training Station in Lake Bluff, Illinois, while the Twelfth was to be headquartered at the Mare Island in Vallejo, California. Both districts were part of a larger administrative unit known as the \\"Ninth, Tenth and Eleventh Naval Districts\\". In 1919 when the Ninth, Tenth and Eleventh Districts were split, the Eleventh Naval District, then known as Commander Navy Southwest, established headquarters for the first Commander with a staff of seven officers at Naval Station North Island. In 1922, when the Naval Supply Center buildings at the foot of Broadway Street on Harbor Drive were completed, the Naval Base Headquarters moved to its present site. With the outbreak of World War II, San Diego's naval establishment played an important role in coordinating the supply provisioning to the war fronts in the Pacific. Naval bases and stations throughout the region were expanded to provide maximum support to combatant forces of the fleet. With Korea, Vietnam and \\"cold war\\" commitments, fleet support activities under Commander Naval Base San Diego remained at a very high level. At that time, the Eleventh District consisted of New Mexico; Arizona; Clark County, Nevada; the southern part of California, including Counties of Santa Barbara, Kern, and all of the counties south of (and including) San Bernardino. When the Twelfth Naval District was disestablished in 1977, Navy Southwest assumed all its duties and responsibilities, and annexed the areas of Colorado, Utah, the rest of Nevada, and the rest of California The Eleventh Naval District was disestablished on 30 September 1980. However, the Commander, Navy Southwest remained as the commander of Naval Base San Diego.

He rose to fame in 2014 by featuring on Duke Dumont's number-one single \\"I Got U\\". He followed this up with his own singles \\"You Don't Know Me\\" featuring Raye and \\"Instruction\\" featuring Demi Lovato and Stefflon Don in 2016 and 2017, respectively. Jax's debut studio album, Snacks (Supersize), was released on 6 September 2019. It was preceded by the single \\"One Touch\\" featuring Jess Glynne. Personal life Jax grew up in a multi-ethnic household and was exposed to a wealth of influences. His father is Turkish and gave him the name Timucin. He is also of Chinese descent. After his Nigerian stepfather introduced him to afrobeat via Fela Kuti and rap with a tape of a Notorious B.I.G. album, Jax listened to hip hop, R&B;, gospel and traditional African music. His Malaysian mother was into music ranging from Kylie Minogue to Luther Vandross and also influenced him. Producers like The Neptunes, Timbaland and Rodney Jerkins shaped his musical horizons and his fascination with the anatomy of a rhythm section. Having initially studied classical guitar from a young age, Jax took up beat-making at 15 after discovering Cubase on his friend's Atari. On 18 September 2020, Jax announced on his Instagram that his wife had given birth to their daughter, Lawana. Music career =Early beginnings= Performing at open mic clubs around London, Jax eventually came together with Ripperman, a grime producer from Mitcham, at Brixton's Raw Materials Studio, and worked on releases for Big Narstie and Roadside Gs, among others in the scene. His parents encouraged him to go to university at 18. Opting to stay closer to Raw Materials, he declined an interview at the University of Oxford to attend Brunel University in Uxbridge. Despite a two-hour trip, Jax went from lectures to the studio daily to work on his craft, posting beats regularly on Myspace. After graduation, Jax rented a studio in Sydenham after not being allowed back in the family home, bought a Mac tower from Gumtree and worked daily to hone his craft. =2014: Breakthrough= After meeting Duke Dumont, he developed an interest in house music and together they co-wrote and produced \\"I Got U\\", \\"Won't Look Back\\" and \\"Ocean Drive\\".

In July 2016, he released the single \\"House Work\\". Jax says of the track, \\"At the end of the day, I started making beats on a four-track, so it feels right to put that DIY energy into my music\\". In December 2016, he released the single \\"You Don't Know Me\\" based on the sampling of the bassline of M.A.N.D.Y. vs. Booka Shade's 2005 hit \\"Body Language\\". The song became his biggest success, reaching number three in the UK and top five status in several European countries, including Germany, Ireland, Belgium and Norway.

Both countries have full diplomatic relations since the middle of the 20th century, and each has been represented by a full embassy in the other, until 2018. History In 1947, Paraguay was one of the thirty-three countries to vote for the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine, effectively paving way for the creation of Israel. The two countries opened up diplomatic relations in 1949. Israel's embassy in Asunci√≥n was closed in 2002 due to budget cuts, although legal professionals in Israel alleged that it was on religious grounds. It was reopened in July 2015. In 2005, the Paraguayan embassy in Mevaseret Zion was closed, also due to budgetary constraints, and reopened in 2013 in Herzliya. On May 21, 2018, Paraguayan President Horacio Cartes announced that the Paraguayan embassy moved to Jerusalem, becoming the third country in the world, after the United States and Guatemala, to recognize the city as the diplomatic capital of Israel. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu greatly appreciated it; on the very day of the transfer, he attended the opening ceremony and there expressed an enduring friendship. This was reversed in September 2018 by Cartes' successor, Mario Abdo Ben√≠tez. Foreign Minister Luis Castiglioni stated that \\"Paraguay wants to contribute to an intensification of regional diplomatic efforts to achieve a broad, fair and lasting peace in the Middle East.\\" Israel subsequently shut down its embassy and cancelled a delegation aimed at aiding Paraguay‚Äôs economic development.Paraguay reverses Jerusalem embassy move; fuming Israel shuts Asunci√≥n mission.

In June 2016, Netafim sent advanced drip irrigation systems to help Paraguay with a drought through Israel's embassy in Asunci√≥n. Trade relations Israel's exports to Paraguay totaled US $6.69 million in 2014, focusing on electronics and minerals. Paraguay's exports to Israel in the same year totaled US $145 million, made up almost exclusively of frozen meat and soybeans. In 2005, when Israel's exports to Paraguay totaled US $2.5 million, the two countries signed a mutual export agreement, which stipulated that each country would help increase mutual trade. In 2010, Israel and Paraguay also agreed to cooperate on agriculture and signed as customs agreement.

He was the president of the Representative Council of Ubangi-Shari from 1949 to 1952, the institutional predecessor of the Central African National Assembly. Biography =Early life (1920-1950)= Georges Darlan was born in 1920 in Kouango (Ouaka) in Ubangi-Shari. Officially, his date of birth was January 5, although it is impossible to authenticate that date because, although born of a European father and a Ubangi mother,Jacques Serre, Biographie de David Dacko: premier pr√©sident de la R√©publique centrafricaine, 1930-2003, Paris, √âditions L'Harmattan, 2007, Georges Darlan was never entered in the civil register of Kouango, which was exclusively used for European citizens. Indeed, like many of mixed race in the colonies, it seems that Darlan's father refused to recognize him or his older brother Antoine Darlan and abandoned them and their African mother.Abel Goumba, Les M√©moires et les R√©flexions politiques du Resistant anti-colonial, d√©mocrate et militant panafricaniste, v. 1, Paris, Ccinia, 2007, Thanks to his European ancestry, Georges Darlan was enrolled in school, which was a privilege because during the interwar period the enrollment rate in Ubangi-Shari was 1.5%.Pierre Biarnes, Si tu vois le margouillat : souvenirs d'Afrique, Paris, √âditions L‚ÄôHarmattan, 2007, His primary education allow him to join the new institution for indigenous people in French Equatorial Africa, the √âcole Edouard Renard in Brazzaville from 1935. He graduated in 1939 with a teacher's diploma. His assignment in Libreville, Gabon, led him to enlist in the Free French Forces in 1941, from which he was discharged in 1945 with the rank of Staff Sergeant. He returned the following year to Ubangi for a commercial career. Darlan became very interested in the emerging politics of the colony. After supporting the bishop Barth√©lemy Boganda in the November 1946 nomination for deputy to the National Assembly of France, he participated in the elections for the newly created Representative Council, on the Economic and Social Action lists for the Native College. His list won all five seats which were up for election. Darlan was elected councilor for Bangui.Juan Fandos-Rius, ¬´ Conseil Repr√©sentatif de l'Oubangui-Chari ¬ª In Parliament of the Central African Republic, 14 novembre 2007 On 19 October 1947 he was elected general counselor of French Equatorial Africa by his peers, along with his older brother Antoine Darlan.Juan Fandos- Rius, ¬´ Oubangui-Chari representatives to France and Brazzaville (1946-1961) ¬ª In Colonial Rulers of Oubangui-Chari, 2 juillet 2008 In August 1947, he was appointed president of the first local political party, the Ubangi Union (UO) founded by Barth√©l√©my Boganda.Jean-Dominique P√©nel, Barth√©l√©my Boganda. √âcrits et Discours. 1946-1951 : la lutte d√©cisive, Paris, L‚ÄôHarmattan, 1995, The UO was a success; its size increased continuously. Darlan used this organization to introduce cooperatives of cotton producers (COTONCOOP) and of consumers (SOCOOMA) in 1948.Jean-Dominique P√©nel, op. cit., Soon a patronage system formed around DarlanJean-Dominique P√©nel, op. cit., and he became the strong man of Ubangi-Shari. His influence over local officials was encouraged by the colonial administration. In 1948, while the majority of indigenous advisers were moving toward the African Democratic Rally (RDA) under the influence of his very liberal brother Antoine Darlan,Jean-Dominique P√©nel, op. cit., Georges Darlan, who was more liberal,Abel Goumba, Les M√©moires et les R√©flexions politiques du Resistant anti-colonial, d√©mocrate et militant panafricaniste, v. 1, Paris, Ccinia, 2007, exerted all his influence to prevent this movement to the left. Only candidates elected in Bangui joined the RDA. The candidates elected from rural areas chose Georges Darlan to be the head of the Representative Council in 1949.Jean-Dominique P√©nel, op. cit., =Ambitions and setbacks, the woes of COTONCOOP (1950-1951)= Georges Darlan had ambitions of being elected as the deputy to the French National Assembly, in place of Barth√©lemy Boganda, with whom his relations had deteriorated. The break occurred in September 1948, when the Representative Council refused to grant a charter to Boganda's cooperative, SOCOULOL√â, although it had granted one to COTONCOOP a few months earlier. Feeling a sense of betrayal, Boganda resigned from the UO one month later.Jean-Dominique P√©nel, op. cit., The UO survived until 1950. In that year, the president of the Representative Council decided to refocus on COTONCOOP, a more flexible body with 24,000 members, whose executives were politically close to him.Jean-Dominique P√©nel, op. cit., The COTONCOOP did not last very long. In July 1950, the Representative Council was surprised to discover that the collection of contributions is made almost mandatory in some areas \\"in the government's name\\".John A. Ballard, The Development of Political Parties in French Equatorial Africa, Fletcher School, 1964, Strong criticism was levelled at its financial management. Of the thirty-two million CFA francs of subsidies granted by the Representative Council, twenty million were squandered; nine million in the purchase of real estate in Bangui, the rest in various construction projects, purchasing of plants, and management fees.International Co-operative Alliance, Year book of agricultural co-operation, Londres, Horace Plunkett Foundation, 1954, In 1951, during the election campaign, the government took control of the company on account of the number of complaints. The reports sent to the Head of Planning and the Governor General of French Equatorial Africa went without appeal; all the company business operations had been performed in vain. Despite these setbacks, Georges Darlan was still considered by the administration to be the main opponent of Boganda in the legislative election of 17 June.Jean-Dominique P√©nel, op. cit., But his controversial actions in his co-operatives and the fact that he had presided over a tax increase while president of the Representative Council were easily exploited by Boganda.Jean- Dominique P√©nel, op. cit., Darlan was discredited by Boganda's campaign tactics.Jean-Dominique P√©nel, op. cit., On 17 June, he came in third place with 8,288 votes, a mere 12.6% of the electorate.Jean-Dominique P√©nel, op. cit., =Political failures and move to Congo (1952-1965) = In 1952, Georges Darlan decided not to stand in the territorial elections. His withdrawal from political life lasted until 1956. In that year, he founded a party, Ubangi Emancipation, and ran unsuccessfully in the Bangui municipal election against Boganda.Jacques Serre, op. cit., In 1957, Georges Darlan reversed his attitude to the RDA and participated in the reformation of the Ubangi section. Boganda then accused him being a \\"messenger of Moscow\\", a false attack since, from 1950 onwards, the RDA had a liberal orientation. In 1959, the founding leader of the RDA, F√©lix Houphou√´t-Boigny of Cote d'Ivoire, chose Darlan to lead the RDA campaign in the parliamentary elections of April in the Central African RepublicJean-Pierre Bat, La d√©colonisation de l'AEF selon Foccart : entre strat√©gies politiques et tactiques s√©curitaires (1956-1969), t.1, Paris, Universit√© Panth√©on-Sorbonne, 2011, (the name of Ubangi-Shari after December 1958), instead of his brother Antoine Darlan.Jean- Pierre Bat, op. cit., t.1, The RDA obtained 2.4% of the votes and no seats in these elections. Darlan fell out of favor with Houphou√´t-Boigny, who turned his attention to the leader of Congo-Brazzaville, Fulbert Youlou. Georges Darlan was ousted in favor of Kobozo, an unknown. Georges Darlan left the Central African political scene in 1960 and moved to the former Belgian Congo. In 1961, he became the economic adviser to Moise Tshombe in his secessionist government of Katanga. The adventure seemed to have come to an end in 1963 when he settled as a merchant in Brazzaville. But beginning in 1965, accused of political activity on behalf of Tshombe, the Congo-Brazzaville authorities expelled him to Bangui, where the President of the Central African Republic David Dacko imprisoned Darlan on arrival, probably to discourage him from resuming political activity. He was set free after a few weeks. On 8 June 1965, George Darlan died, while attempting to set up a business in Bangui. Abel Goumba raises the possibility of an assassination: Darlan is said to have drunken a \\"glass\\" in the company of a young woman, become ill suddenly, and been hurriedly returned home, where he died. For Goumba, the circumstances are similar to the murder by poisoning of the Cameroonian opposition leader F√©lix- Roland Moumi√© in Geneva in 1960.Abel Goumba, op. cit., References 1920 births 1965 deaths People of French Equatorial Africa Central African Republic politicians ","title":"Georges Darlan"},{"id":"51128633","text":"The Cambridge School was established by Mr. Collins and Mrs. Flavia Albuquerque.

The building was constructed in 1880 and was originally owned by the McKail family. John McKail, a merchant and (briefly) member of parliament, had operated from a warehouse and woolstore on the site until his death in 1871. His family, trading as John McKail & Co., has the current building erected in 1880. McKail also built a wool store behind the building facing the opposite direction with the frontage along Frederick Street. In 1888, following McKail's death, the business and building were acquired by Charles Drew and John Robinson who had recently formed Drew, Robinson & Co. By 1902 the building was being used to house a cafe, the Central Coffee Palace. A fire, which resulted in damage estimated at ¬£6,000, occurred later the same year. It was occupied by John Zervoothakis who was not injured. The neighbouring building, the White Star Hotel, was preserved only by the constant application of wet blankets to the woodwork. The fire gutted the building leaving only the facade and the side walls standing. It was rebuilt in 1903 and was used as a tobacconist, hairdresser, hostel and cafe. Thomas Wardle, owner of Tom the Cheap grocery chain, acquired the building in 1968 along with other with plans to demolish them and build a shopping complex. The building was also being used by the Albany Light Opera Company was housed in the building in the late 1970s before the building became empty and derelict. Acquired in 1980 by Gwen and Morris Blake the building was extensively restored and opened as a bookshop. The building was converted for use as a restaurant in 1987, initially known as Dylan's on the Terrace and now called Dylan's Cafe and Restaurant. A grant of 57,600 was awarded to the owners of the building in 2015 for restoration work including painting the fa√ßade and verandah and installing a new verandah roof.

Location The Itingu√ßu State Park covers a group of mountains along the Atlantic coast to the southwest of the town of Peru√≠be. The park is in the municipality of Peru√≠be on the south coast of S√£o Paulo. It is divided into two sections. The N√∫cleo Itingu√ßu, a conservation unit in the Jur√©ia-Itatins Mosaic of conservation units, receives most of the visitors. The N√∫cleo do Arpoador is only open for visits for the purpose of education or scientific research. To the northeast the Guara√∫ River separates the park from the Balne√°rio Gar√ßa Vermelha. The Atlantic Ocean forms the east and southeast boundary. The Ilhas do Abrigo e Guararitama Wildlife Refuge is offshore to the east. To the south it adjoins the Barra do Una Sustainable Development Reserve. To the west and northwest it adjoins the Jur√©ia-Itatins Ecological Station (ESEC), separated from the ESEC by the Una do Prelado River. The Ilha do Ameixal Area of Relevant Ecological Interest, which lies between two arms of the Una do Prelado, intrudes into the state park. Environment and facilities The Itingu√ßu State Park contains large areas of well-preserved Atlantic Forest, waterfalls, beaches, rocky shores, mangroves and salt marsh forest. It is rich in fauna, especially birds, including 30 species of hummingbirds and woodpeckers. The park has administrative facilities in the Guara√∫ Beach community, an auditorium with capacity for 40 people, a laboratory and a craft store. It is reached from there via the Guara√∫ Road. In the park itself there is parking, food kiosks and toilets. There are several marked trails with stairs and handrails. The park has the infrastructure to conduct educational programs, and provides environmental monitors for groups. History The Jur√©ia-Itatins Mosaic of conservation units was created by law 12.406 of 12 December 2006. It included the Jur√©ia-Itatins Ecological Station and the newly created Itingu√ßu and Prelado state parks, the Despraiado and Barra do Una sustainable development reserves and the Ilhas do Abrigo e Guararitama Wildlife Refuge. The state parks and sustainable development reserves were carved out of the ecological station. On 11 September 2007 the procurer general of the state declared that law 12.406 was unconstitutional. On 10 June 2009 a judgement upheld the finding of unconstitutionality. Law 14.982 of 8 April 2013 again altered the limits of the Jur√©ia-Itatins Ecological Station, re-categorising some areas. These included the Itingu√ßu State Park. The law recreated the Jureia-Itatins Mosaic, which includes the park and other conservation units. The law defined the park as a \\"special zone of ecotourism interest\\". Work and activities in the park were to be mainly performed by the traditional residents of the conservation unit mosaic.

He is member in Locomotiv GT and was member in Omega, a prominent personality of the Hungarian pop music.  Biography  Childhood Born in Budapest in 1948, his parents are G√©za Presser and Uhrman Elvira. His father worked as a poultry dealer in the Great Market hall at Klauz√°l square. After school his son, G√°bor went out to help him. G√°bor Presser started playing the piano at the age of four, the pianist Imre Antal also acknowledged the child's talents and predicted that he would become a great artist. He finished the primary school in Kert√©sz street, and subsequently started his studies at the Music High School, meanwhile he played piano at a street dancing school in Kap√°s street for a 14 HUF hourly rate. He started to deal with composing as a teenager. The family lived at Dob street 46/B on the first floor, and above their home lived the composer and pianist Rezs≈ë Seress. Presser was already a teenager, and he often talked up Seress who showed him records and sheet music as well. Seress was listening every day from 2 pm to 6 pm different arrangements of the Gloomy Sunday, which were broadcast to the surrounding homes. Presser later reflected to these memories in his song Plafon, which Lajos Parti Nagy wrote the text. Omega (1967‚Äì1971) (band) Presser during high school was only interested in classical music at the time, but his classmate Tam√°s Mih√°ly took him to concerts of the band Scampolo, where he was occasionally playing in. Starting 1967 Presser started to write his own songs for Omega (until then they were only playing covers of foreign hits.) In the summer, he became one of their musicians playing on keyboards. The band tried out a unique arrangements: no solo guitarist, but two keyboardists. The arrangement was not very successful and Presser was replaced by Gy√∂rgy Moln√°r guitarist. During this time, he played with Scampolo and started writing songs for L√°szl√≥ Kom√°r. He was called back to be part of the band in 1968, just before the band's British tour. After a few singles, he became the main songwriter of Omega's first three albums and some of those he sang himself. After Presser left the band (1971) he played again live with his bandmates on the Omega‚ÄìLGT‚ÄìBeatrice tour in 1980, at the 25 year anniversary concert in 1987, and later in 1994 and 1999. He also contributed to Omega's album titled Trans and Dance as songwriter for two songs, and as guest keyboardist. Locomotiv GT (1971‚Äì1984) Presser wanted more than to play Omega's music and quit the band to form Locomotiv GT with bass player K√°roly Frenreisz, guitarist Tam√°s Barta, and drummer J√≥zsef Laux. It was the first Hungarian so called 'supergroup'. All of the founding members, except Presser, left the group by 1977. The final act consists of Presser, Tam√°s Soml√≥, J√°nos Kar√°csony and J√°nos Solti. Presser wrote or co-wrote most of LGT's songs. Additionally, Presser also got involved in theater work. His first musical appeared at the V√≠gsz√≠nh√°z (Comedy Theatre of Budapest) in Budapest, an adaptation of Tibor D√©ry's novel titled An Imaginary Report from an American Pop Festival. Presser has written music for several theatre pieces at the Comedy Theatre of Budapest. He has been the music director of the theatre since 1978 and has his own evening shows there. His first solo album came out in 1982, titled Electromantic, which was originally the music for a ballet piece titled The Rehearsal written for electric instruments. Part of the music was used as a title song for BBC's news program. La Baletta No. 2. was used as the title piece for the Budapest Regional News. Since the 1970s Presser has written music for and collaborated with many Hungarian artists such as Sarolta Zalatnay, Ferenc Demj√©n, Andr√°s Kern, Gyula Vikid√°l, Zor√°n, Kati Kov√°cs, Kl√°ri Katona, and S√°ndor R√©v√©sz. The last LGT album was released in 1984. Past LGT years Presser started a new theatre production, which resulted in ‚ÄòA padl√°s‚Äô (The Attic) in 1988. The first real Presser album was released in 1994 titled ‚ÄòCsak dalok‚Äô (‚ÄòOnly Tunes‚Äô) that was followed by Kis t√∂rt√©netek (‚ÄòLittle Stories‚Äô) in 1996. Presser had 9 full house nights at the Comedy Theatre of Budapest in 1995, after them he stopped performing until 2001 when he did a 50 concert tour (this was recorded on CD/DVD). After the year 1998 Presser has been releasing a new compilation album every couple of years. Even though LGT dissolved in the 80s, they had a farewell concert in 1992 (which was also released on a CD). They released two albums with new material in 1997 and in 2002. They had a free concert in 1999, organized a LGT festival in 2002, and performed as the opening at the famous Sziget Festival. They also performed a series of concerts in 2013. In 2009, Presser himself held a concert celebrating his 40-year career with many musician guests. Some of the material from this concert is available on CD. In the next 2 years Presser worked on a 74-minute album that was released in 2011, which consists of Lajos Parti Nagy‚Äôs poetry made into music. In 2013, a Kanye West song, ‚ÄòNew Slaves‚Äô, was nominated for a Grammy that contained about a minute long sample of Omega's big hit from 45 years ago Gy√∂ngyhaj√∫ l√°ny (music written by Presser). In 2015, Presser released an album ‚ÄòSzeren√°d helyett‚Äô that lead the hit list on iTunes.  Albums  This is a simplified list that does not contain all the albums Presser appeared as an artist.

He was one of the leaders of the pro-independence Tunisian national movement, along with Habib Bourguiba and Salah ben Youssef. His assassination is attributed to La Main Rouge (The Red Hand), an armed organisation that favoured a French presence in Tunisia. More recently, on 18 December 2009, it was confirmed to the Al Jazeera news organisation, by a man called Antoine M√©l√©ro, who claimed to be a former Main Rouge member, that the Main Rouge had been a military wing of the French Service de Documentation Ext√©rieure et de Contre-Espionnage (External Documentation and Counter-Espionage Service) or SDECE. Life =Early years= Farhat Hached was born at El Abassia on the Islands of Kerkennah, the son of Mohamed Hached, a sailor, and Hana Ben Romdhane. He spent eight years at the village primary school in Kellabine which was run by a French head teacher. He received his Certificate of Primary Education which might have opened the way to further education, but his father's death obliged him to abandon his studies and take on paid work. In 1930 he took a job as a courier with \\"la Soci√©t√© du transport du Sahel\\", a transport company based at Sousse. In the same year he established a basic trades union at the company which he affiliated to the French Trades Union Confederation (CGT). This was the start of his career in Tunisian trades unionism. He took on a range of union responsibilities locally and in the region and, later, in national administration, working with . As a result, he was dismissed from his job in 1939. During the Second World War, with Tunisia subject to the French puppet government at Vichy, a ban on political and trades union activity made life difficult. Hached therefore volunteered for work with the Red Cross in order to look after the injured, a task which he undertook outside his working hours. In 1942 Tunisia became a significant theatre for the fighting between principal wartime belligerents and the requirements of the Vichy government lost their significance as local administrative responsibilities passed to the Free French colonial government. In 1943 Hached was recruited for government service which meant relocation to Sfax where he was able to resume his trades union activities. The same year he married a kinswoman from Kerkennah, Oum El Khir (Emna Hached). =Trades union leader= As war in Europe continued, at the departmental congress of the CGT in March 1944, recognising the inability of the leadership in \\"Metropolitan France\\" to respond appropriately to the needs of workers in Tunisia, and disappointed by the failure of communists and socialists within it to support \\"the legitimate aspirations of Tunisians for national independence\\", he broke with the CGT. In November 1944, with other Tunisian trades unionists, he took the initiative to launch an autonomous Tunisian trades union, starting with the \\"Union of Free Trades Unionists in the South\\" (\\"Union des syndicats libres du Sud\\") based in Sfax. The focus was on three priorities: social justice, equality between Tunisian workers and those of French provenance, and national independence. In 1945 he established, in addition, the \\"Union of Free Trades Unionists in the North\\" (\\"Union des syndicats libres du Nord\\"), based in Tunis. On 20 January 1946 a joint congress took place at which the \\"Union of Free Trades Unionists in the South\\", the \\"Union of Free Trades Unionists in the North\\" and the \\"General Tunisian Labour Union\\" (\\"F√©d√©ration g√©n√©rale tunisienne du travail\\") which had been founded back in 1936, combined together to form the Tunisian General Labour Union (\\"Union G√©n√©rale Tunisienne du Travail\\" / UGTT). In 1947, still aged only 32, Hached was unanimously elected as the first General Secretary of the UGTT. From the start, for Farhat Hached the Tunisian trades union movement was an integral part of the struggle for independence. Autonomous and independent, it was an important and dependable pillar for the nationalist project, defined and directed by the Neo Destour \\"party.\\" The strikes, demonstrations and street protests in support of independence intensified from 1946, in parallel with demands for improvements in living and working conditions for Tunisians. The UGTT, directed by Hached, played a central role in triggering and choreographing episodes of unrest and in radicalising popular demands. In 1949 the UGTT signed up to the newly created International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU), and Hached joined the executive committee of the international body, building up international contacts within the US/western oriented labour organisation at a succession of meetings within and beyond north Africa. At the fourth congress of the UGTT, in March 1951, Hached provided an account of its achievements after five years under his leadership. Almost 120,000 members, from all sectors and from all regions of the country, had joined the national organisation. A real grass roots guerilla movement was being conducted against the French colonial administration. According to Hached, the UGTT had already won from the colonialists important civil rights and guarantees for Tunisian society as a whole. Furthermore, joining the ICFTU in 1949 ensured an global voice for the UGTT. Beyond that, the construction of a regional trades union federation for north Africa was a priority for Hached, to embrace embryonic union movements in Algeria and Morocco, and create independent trades unions in Libya that could establish appropriate union structures there. Finally, with its social and economic programmes, along with its precepts on freedoms and liberties, the UGTT provided the nationalist movement with a coherent national agenda for the post liberation era. =National leader= In 1952 direct negotiations between the French and Tunisian governments broke down. Repression followed. Habib Bourguiba and the other leaders of the nationalist movement were arrested. Salah ben Youssef, the Tunisian Minister of Justice, was sent by the Tunisian government to the United Nations with a request for statehood: he barely escaped arrest and deportation. On 26 March 1952 M'hamed Chenik and other leaders of the protectorate government were arrested. The French imposed a curfew and a ban on all political activity, while the Foreign Legion conducted mass arrests. In this context of crisis the UGTT found itself in the front line of political and armed resistance against the French protectorate authorities. It retained a level of protection for trades union legislation and from the support of the ICFTU, the labour movement in the US and the Democratic Party, which at this time held power in the United States. As leader of the Labour Union and thereby head of the anti-colonial resistance, Hached secretly organised groups of activists in the regional trades union offices, to head up armed attacks against symbols of French authority. He also led strike actions. The French reacted aggressively, with more than 20,000 trades unionists arrested and placed in prison and concentration camps. In April 1952 Hached travelled to Brussels and New York City under the auspices of the ICFTU in order to represent the voice of Tunisians when Moroccan and Tunisian issues were discussed by the United Nations Security Council. The French government felt obliged to come up with a new reform plan. Hached suggested that the Bey of Tunis should convene a council of forty people representing Tunisian opinions that should study the French plan and present an opinion of it on 2 August: the suggestion was rejected, however. =Assassination= Threats Farhat Hached was marked out because of the danger he represented to the colonial interests in Tunisia and across North Africa more generally. Various departments and agencies of French Intelligence started, in October 1952, to draw up proposals: he could be removed from Tunisian territory, imprisoned, placed under house arrest or murdered. During the next couple of months he became subject to permanent surveillance and there was a proliferation of threatening tracts and leaflets emanating from La Main Rouge (\\"The Red Hand\\"). There were also physical threats against his home and family. Calls for Hached's murder became more insistent. Ambush On the morning of 5 December 1952 an ambush operation was implemented to eliminate Hached. He was followed by a car as he left Rad√®s, the suburb of Tunis where he lived. Machine guns were fired at him from the car which then drove off at high speed. Hached sustained injuries to a shoulder and a hand, but was able to get out of his car. A few moments later a second car appeared carrying three men: observing that he was still alive they approached him and shot him in the head, before depositing his body beside the road less than a kilometer away. The announcement of his death on the radio at midday triggered protests across the country, along with demonstrations in Casablanca,‚Üë Rachida Dumas-Dir√®che [sous la dir. de], Le Maroc de 1912 √† nos jours, √©d. Centre d'√©tudes arabes, 2006, p. 72 () Cairo, Damascus, Beirut, Karachi Djakarta, Milan, Brussels and Stockholm.Abdelaziz Barrouhi et Ali Mahjoubi, ¬´ Justice pour Farhat Hached ¬ª, Jeune Afrique, 21 mars 2010, p. 48 The socialist publication \\"Nord-Matin\\" reported \\"bloody riots in Casablanca. 40 dead and many injured.

Apr√®s l'assassinat de Farhat Hached et les maladresses du r√©sident, les troubles s'√©tendent √† l'Alg√©rie et au Maroc \\"). The French liberal establishment rushed into print to denounce the assassination in newspaper articles, public declarations, petitions and demonstrations. Prominent among these were Daniel Gu√©rin, Roger St√©phane, Claude Bourdet David Rousset, Ren√© Louzon, Alain Savary and Charles-Andr√© Julien. Hached's 22 year old widow was left with four children: Noureddine (8), Naceur (5), Jamila (3) and Samira (6 months). The body His body was transported on a boat from the little port of La Goulette to Kerkennah to be handed over to his family. Eventually, in 1955, the body was taken to Tunis and placed in a mausoleum constructed in the kasbah, on the spot where during his life he used to harangue the crowds. For 2002, which marked the fiftieth anniversary of the assassination, a new mausoleum was constructed to accommodate his remains. The anniversary was celebrated annually till 2012, each 5 December, by the Tunisian president, representatives of important institutions and corporations, and of his family.

Established in 1938, Cameron's boasts a periodical inventory estimated at nearly 100,000 volumes, the shop has become one of the largest vintage magazine dealers in the United States. The store was slated to close in November 2019. However, a successful crowdfunding campaign allowed a longtime employee to purchase the business and continue operations within the same space. History =Bob Cameron= The shop‚Äôs founding owner/operator and namesake Robert Edmond ‚ÄúBob‚Äù Cameron, a graduate of Franklin High School, attended Albany College before finding work with the Multnomah County Library. A devoted philatelist, he‚Äôd long hoped to become a stamp dealer, and, in 1930 at the age of 22, he launched the Cameron Stamp Company inside El Ray‚Äôs bookstore on downtown Portland‚Äôs SW Park Avenue between Yamhill and Taylor, where Director Park currently sits. As clients and personal acquaintances began bringing Cameron other items to sell, Cameron recognized that used books represented his greatest source of revenue. Eight years later, the first iteration of his eponymous bookstore would open. Cameron‚Äôs would relocate seven times, occasionally changing names along the way. By 1956, the shop had moved to 825 SW 3rd Avenue, and, in 1964, it finally found a permanent residence in 1964 on the corner of SW 3rd Avenue and Stark_Street, now known as SW Harvey Milk Street. Their trademark (and long-broken) neon signage first appeared in 1984. A large campaign poster for Wayne Morse, the controversial US Senator from Oregon, has been hanging above their counter since the Vietnam era. Otherwise, as a 2009 Oregonian story about the ‚ÄúPortland institution‚Äù stressed, ‚Äúnot much has changed since. The aisles can be cramped, and the shelves are loaded. But that‚Äôs part of the charm.‚Äù Stamps remained a lifelong passion of Cameron‚Äôs founder. He ensured the bookstore always stocked them and continued to work in the field through his 1977 retirement. Furthermore, he maintained regular shifts as clerk, manning the register for one hour each day until his death 11 years later. In a 1972 Northwest Magazine piece, which suggested Cameron‚Äôs was Portland‚Äôs only store to freely offer customers paper shopping bags with handles, its proprietor was described as ‚Äúthe bookish- looking fellow who appears younger than his 64 years, the one with glasses, pipe, and the dried-pea green cardigan ‚Ä¶ his placid mien and barely audible speech in complete contrast to the hubub around him.‚Äù =Fred Goetz= In 1976, at the age of 58, Frederick James Goetz assumed ownership of Cameron‚Äôs. After an early stint as Baltimore Sun copy boy and occasional gofer for H. L. Mencken, Goetz served in the Merchant Marine during World War II. After settling in Portland, he originated the popular weekly \\"Outdoor Scene\\" column for an early incarnation of the NW Labor Press in 1955, which soon spread his byline through about three dozen union-oriented publications across the country. Taking into account his freelance artticles for such national glossies as Sports Afield and Field & Stream, an NWLP obituary estimated that Goetz reached around 12 million headers at his height as ‚Äúthe most widely- circulated outdoor writer in the United States.‚Äù Perhaps because of this experience, Goetz chose to expand the shop‚Äôs repertoire beyond books and stamps. Cameron‚Äôs had never sold periodicals until then, and a 1985 Oregonian article surmised ‚Äúthat introduction to journalism and magazines in particular‚Äù instilled the former columnist‚Äôs ‚Äúlifelong love affair with periodicals.‚Äù According to a Virginia Quarterly Review profile of the store‚Äôs third owner Jeff Frase, however, they were added simply to ‚Äúdiversify stock and add another revenue stream.‚Äù As Frase told the VQR, there ‚Äújust seemed to be a market that no one else was dealing with locally at the time.‚Äù In any event, within his ‚Äòsecret library‚Äô behind the Employees Only sign, Goetz compiled vast troves, including the first issues of more than 250 separate magazines. As his collection mushroomed with volumes brought by walk-ins or plucked from estate sales, the owner constructed a labyrinthine vault inside the storage area where rickety stairs head up to a catwalk-bisected mezzanine whose walls have been stacked floor to ceiling with vintage media. A narrow passageway lined with lurid paperback novels leads to a small attic with, as the Oregonian wrote, ‚Äúa carefully catalogued library‚Äù holding ‚Äú70 years of The Saturday Evening Post ... Collier's, Look, Esquire, Popular Science, Popular Mechanics, Arizona Highways, Liberty, National Geographic ‚Äì magazines covering everything from fashion and cooking to natural sciences and engineering.‚Äù Marveling at their breadth of adult material, Willamette Week‚Äôs survey of their ‚Äúimpeccably curated magazine bank‚Äù noted ‚Äúthe Playboy archive bleeds into a jaw-dropping glimpse into the evolving American male hive mind as the 1950s' swinging photographer (Sunbather, Pose) turned '60s lothario (Escapade, Ace), '70s rocker (Adam, The Dude) and '80s perv weekender (Nugget).‚Äù =Jeff Frase= In 1982, Goetz brought on a 30-year-old Jeffery Frase as part-time assistant charged with helming the intricate filing system. While laid off from an apartment maintenance job, he‚Äôd been filling in for the vacationing proprietor of the Sellwood neighborhood bookshop King of Rome, who recommended him to Goetz, and, by the next year, Frase had been promoted to manager. With help from a familial loan, he took full ownership in 1989. \\"I was trying out all kinds of little stores like this,\\" Frase told the Oregonian. \\"It could've been a record store. It just so happened Cameron's was hiring.\\" Situated on a block whose northern bookend, the Portland Outdoor Store, has been in business since 1919, Cameron‚Äôs managed to weather its share of dry spells, but changing economic climes had especially ravaged 21st century independent bookstores. By 2011, used magazines represented 40% of store sales. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a tough market,‚Äù Frase told the Oregonian. \\"The big chains came in, then the online sales, and now electronic readers. Those are three big hits.‚Äù Still, they maintained a steady clientele of walk-ins and downtown office-workers, and, when work on downtown Portland‚Äôs Transit Mall redirected bus service down 3rd Avenue from 2007 through 2009, the new influx of bored commuters browsing through spinner racks helped see the shop through the Great Recession. In addition, longtime employee Crystal Zingsheim had long sought to cultivate a digital marketplace that would allow a national consumer base to virtually browse the shop‚Äôs singular cache of rarities. Though at first hesitant about cultivating Cameron's internet presence, Frase eventually began opening the shop's inventory to e-commerce through such websites as AbeBooks and Biblio.com. ‚ÄúWe broke down,‚Äù he admitted, but \\"listing our products online helped out sales.‚Äù (Even past owner Fred Goetz had launched his own e-bookshop midst retirement as means of hawking book-fair finds before his 2002 death.) Their periodical archive had also begun attracting a new clientele of graphic designers, social researchers, machinists, and representatives of advertising agencies and academic institutions. Similiarly, the vintage magazines were prized by film and television crews seeking authenticity for period pieces. \\"When productions around the country need otherwise unavailable periodicals as set props or reference material,‚Äù Zingsheim told Willamette Week, ‚Äúthe filmmakers send us an order specifying time period, historical context, and the mood of the scene they want to develop, and we pull the matching documents from our collection.\\" =Threatened Closure= The store's exterior, 2017 For more than sixty years, the retail space currently housing Cameron‚Äôs had been owned by the bookstore‚Äôs upstairs neighbors ‚Äì the Golden Dragon Restaurant. Beginning in 2008, famed PDX gay bar Silverado would lease the premises for another decade before 18+ adult lounge Golden Dragon Exotic Club opened inside the former Chinese buffet‚Äôs location. In 2018, the strip club‚Äôs ownership group Jdsy 3rd Street LLC purchased the entire building for $3 million. The outgoing landords contractually stipulated that all tenants would continue to pay the same rental costs for one year without increase, and, with that grace period set to expire, then-owner Jeff Frase received a surprise notice to vacate the premises by December 1st 2019. ‚ÄúI kept expecting to hear from them about what was going to happen,‚Äù he told KOIN News, ‚Äúand, instead of making me an offer to see whether I can stay, they just ‚Ä¶ refused to renew the lease.‚Äù Faced with a de facto eviction notice, the 67-year-old Frase had originally planned to retire and shutter the bookstore before one of his employees broached the crowdfunding strategy. Crystal Zingsheim, who‚Äôd learned the rare book trade through a young apprenticeship with her father‚Äôs San Jose business, had worked with Frase for almost 20 years and hoped to take over the business following his retirement. ‚ÄúI want to keep Cameron‚Äôs alive,‚Äù she said to the Oregonian about becoming the bookstore‚Äôs fourth owner. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not about me or Jeff. We are simply caretakers of a legacy.‚Äù To that end, Zingsheim launched a Kickstarter page aimed at attracting enough capital to safeguard the shop‚Äôs inventory and fund its relocation. One month later, contributions from nearly 400 supporters had overshot the campaign‚Äôs stated $30,000 goal by more than $2K. While searching out an appropriate new locale, Zingsheim also negotiated a temporary stay of eviction that allowed the business to stay open through a short-term lease. Frase, who still maintains a presence at the shop as occasional clerk and used book scout, happily signed over Cameron‚Äôs to the new owner on the night before Christmas 2019. Zingsheim has spoken with Doug Whyte , executive director of the Hollywood Theater, about the possibility of moving bookstore operations toward the same not-profit status that allowed the beloved Movie Madness video rental store to survive changing economic conditions under the Hollywood‚Äôs aegis. In addition, she has outlined plans for digitizing large swaths of Cameron‚Äôs archive, which contains periodicals dating back to the mid-1800s, and building an easily-accessible database for both written content and images. ‚ÄúMore than 30% of our collection is the last remaining copy,‚Äù Zingsheim told the Oregonian, adding that ‚Äúthe information ‚Ä¶ encompasses the last couple hundred years of American history. It represents who and what makes up our country.‚Äù Cultural Influence Bishop's House, 2011 Portland City Commissioner and Independent Publishing Resource Center co-founder Chloe Eudaly, who first came to prominence as owner/operator of seminal mid-90s PDX zine emporium Reading Frenzy in 1994, has said an early stint working at Cameron‚Äôs offered her first ‚Äúbasic overview of the book business.‚Äù Longtime downtown resident Thomas Lauderdale, founder of internationally-celebrated PDX lounge-pop troupe Pink Martini, listed Cameron‚Äôs as one of four candidates for his personal ‚ÄòPortland Hall of Fame.‚Äô Pulitzer-winning historian Debby Applegate, raised in the nearby suburb of Clackamas, has credited childhood trips to the bookshop as helping cultivate her love of reading. Given its proximity to downtown Portland's hotel district, the shop regularly attracts visiting celebrities as well. While on tour with country legend Merle Haggard, iconic singer-songwriter Bob Dylan reportedly stepped inside Cameron‚Äôs to purchase a Time feature on Haggard after spotting the cover within their window display. UK film star Richard Harris came into the store looking for a 1967 Life magazine and told former- owner Frase that he had been promised that issue‚Äôs cover until news broke about the surprise defection of Svetlana Alliluyeva, Soviet leader Joseph Stalin‚Äôs only daughter. (Alliluyeva‚Äôs youngest daughter would herself open a curio boutique in NW Portland) Before embarking upon a 2009 global tour that took the avant-rock duo through Brisbane and Beijing, Kill Rock Stars act Panther shot a music video at Cameron‚Äôs as part of The Penny Jam series of tastemaker PDX bands playing unlikely venues. In this clip, frontman Charlie Salas-Humara (Sun Angle founding member, Walter Salas-Humara nephew) and drummer Joe Kelly 31Knots are crammed into the north window display for a hurtling rendition of then-unreleased single ‚ÄúControl Your Ships‚Äù. In 2011, while attending the Wieden+Kennedy12 advertising school, future Nike designers Jin Ryu and Yi-fan Lu filmed a documentary exploring ‚Äúthe strong communities ... built up around the unique secondhand book market\\" that focused on the shop's ‚Äúresurgence amongst the newest generation ‚Äì a group known for their reliance on technology.‚Äù Screened as part of the 38th Northwest Filmmakers' Festival, Willamette Week critic Matthew Singer deemed Cameron's Books ‚Äúbest and most straightforward‚Äù of the short program and wrote that the doc achieved ‚Äúthe tenor of a nature program capturing a creature in the wild just before its species goes extinct.‚Äù See also * Powell's Books References External links * 1938 establishments in Oregon Bookstores of the United States Companies based in Portland, Oregon Retail companies established in 1938 Southwest Portland, Oregon ","title":"Cameron's Books and Magazines"},{"id":"51129094","title":"Ucha, Kapurthala"},{"id":"51129124","text":"On July 18, 2016, Charles Kinsey, a mental health therapist, was shot in the leg by a police officer in North Miami, Florida. Kinsey had been retrieving his 27-year-old autistic patient, Arnaldo Rios Soto, who had run away from his group home. Police encountered the pair while they were searching for an armed suicidal man. Kinsey was lying on the ground with his hands in the air, and trying to negotiate between officers and his patient, when he was shot. The officer who shot Kinsey said he had been aiming at the patient, who the officer believed was threatening Kinsey with a gun. Both Kinsey and his patient were unarmed. Following the shooting, Kinsey said he was handcuffed and left bleeding on the ground for 20 minutes without police giving him medical aid. Authorities said they were investigating the incident, which received significant media attention following the appearance of cellphone video footage. The officer who shot Kinsey, Jonathan Aledda, was arrested in 2017, and charged with attempted manslaughter and negligence. In June 2019, Aledda was found guilty by a jury of culpable negligence. One day after being found guilty, Aledda was also fired from the police force. However, he did not serve any prison time and instead was sentenced to probation and asked to write a 2,500 word essay on policing. He ultimately served a total of less than 5 months of probation before being released. His conviction also will not appear on his criminal record. After Aledda was found guilty, Kinsey and the City of North Miami reached a settlement for an undisclosed amount in a federal lawsuit Kinsey had filed. Background On July 18, 2016, shortly before 5:00 p.m. EDT, a 27-year-old male non-verbal severely autistic man clutching a silver toy tanker truck ran away from his mental health facility, MacTown Panther Group Homes. Charles Kinsey, a 47-year-old mental health worker, followed his patient out of the facility to retrieve him. Kinsey had worked at the facility for over a year, was involved in community efforts to keep local kids in school, and is the father of five children. According to NPR, Kinsey has been a member of the local \\"Circle of Brotherhood\\" group whose mission is \\"Serving and Protecting our Community\\". The police were at the same time responding to reports of a man threatening to shoot himself in the area, at Northeast 127th Street and 14th Avenue. Police received a call around 5:30 p.m. The North Miami Assistant Police Chief, Neal Cuevas, said that the autistic man did not comply with orders when the police arrived on the scene. Shooting While Kinsey lay on the ground with his hands raised, one officer, North Miami Police Department Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) team member Jonathon Aledda, who was away, said he thought the patient was holding the therapist hostage and that the small silver toy truck being clutched by the patient was a gun, following a report made by a passing female motorist, at whom the patient had pointed the toy truck which the motorist believed appeared to be a firearm, and a dispatch to the police officers that there was a \\"male with a gun\\". Aledda said \\"It appeared he [the Black therapist] was screaming for mercy or for help or something. In my mind, the white male [the patient] had a gun. I couldn't hear what the black man was saying. In my mind, I thought he might get shot.\\" Aledda said he had not aimed at Kinsey, but rather had been aiming at Rios-Soto, who he believed was threatening the therapist with a gun. Aledda fired three .223 caliber rounds from his Colt M4 Carbine rifle, which did not have advanced optical sights, with one bullet striking Kinsey in the right leg. The shooting occurred a block from the group home where Kinsey worked at 1365 NE 128th St. Kinsey's lawyer Hilton Napoleon II provided the Miami Herald with a cellphone video of Kinsey lying on the ground, his hands in the air, moments before the shooting. The man who took the video initially thought that the patient had a gun in his hands. In the video Kinsey asks police not to shoot him, while his patient plays with his toy truck. Kinsey said he was trying to convince his patient, who was clutching a small toy truck, to obey officers' commands. The video also shows Kinsey telling police that he is unarmed. In the video Kinsey is seen telling police, \\"All he has is a toy truck. A toy truck. I am a behavior therapist at a group home.\\" Kinsey is also shown telling his patient, \\"Please be still... lay down on your stomach.\\" While two of his fellow officers were close enough to hear what Kinsey was saying, the shooting officer was not. Kinsey said that after he was shot, police turned him on his back, handcuffed him, and left him bleeding on the road for 20 minutes, and that police did nothing to stop Kinsey's bleeding before an ambulance arrived. A second video shows officers carrying rifles and patting down Kinsey and his patient while they lie on the ground. Aftermath A witness to the shooting told the Associated Press that when police arrived, he grabbed binoculars and saw that the autistic man seated in the road, next to Kinsey, was holding a toy truck. He informed an officer that the man was holding a toy and not a gun, but she told him to back up and did not inform other officers. Kinsey was shot shortly afterwards. One officer, about 15-20 feet away, heard Kinsey yelling and said over the radio to \\"use caution\\" because \\"the person advised that it's a toy.\\" A minute later, at least 30 seconds before shots were fired, that officer said over the radio to the other police officers at the scene that he had a visual, and that the item did not appear to him to be a firearm, but appeared to be a toy truck. Kinsey said he was more worried about his patient, who did not have his hands raised, and did not believe he himself would be shot. \\"As long as I've got my hands up, they're not gonna shoot me, that's what I'm thinking,\\" Kinsey said. \\"Wow, I was wrong.\\" Kinsey said that being shot \\"was so surprising, it was like a mosquito bite.\\" He said that when he was shot his life flashed before his eyes, and he thought of his family. According to Kinsey, when he asked the officer why he had shot him, the officer replied, \\"I don't know.\\" Kinsey's lawyer said that when another officer asked the shooting officer \\"why did you shoot this guy\\", the shooter again responded, \\"I don't know.\\" Kinsey survived the shooting after being taken to Jackson Memorial Hospital. Kinsey's wife said, \\"I'm just grateful he's alive and able to tell his story.\\" Following the shooting, the name of the police officer who shot Kinsey was not immediately revealed to the public. Police later announced that the shooter was a 30-year- old Hispanic officer who had worked in the police department for four years, and was a member of the SWAT team. Miami police subsequently identified the officer as Jonathon Aledda. A police department employee told the Herald that the officer fired because the autistic patient did not obey police commands. On July 22, the local president of the Florida Police Benevolent Association chapter in Dade County, John Rivera, said that the officer who fired the bullets was aiming for Kinsey's patient, and was \\"trying to save Kinsey's life.\\" Rivera said that Kinsey \\"did everything right.\\" In response, Napoleon and some media outlets questioned the explanation that Kinsey was shot accidentally, and asked why Kinsey was handcuffed and left bleeding on the ground after being shot. A second officer was initially placed on administrative leave, but prosecutors then found that the officer had not lied when he told investigators he didn't witness the shooting, because he had in fact returned to a police cruiser when the shot was fired. Police announced that the Miami-Dade State Attorney's Office would assist with an ongoing investigation. An inquiry into the shooting was performed by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, at the request of both North Miami police and the state attorney's office. Legal proceedings On August 3, 2016, Kinsey filed a federal lawsuit against Jonathon Aledda, claiming he violated his civil rights and used excessive force and falsely arrested him. In his complaint, Kinsey stated that Aledda violated his Fourth Amendment right to be free from excessive force during police seizures when he shot him in the leg. He also stated that Aledda put handcuffs on him that were too tight, cutting off his circulation. On April 12, 2017, Jonathon Aledda was arrested on charges of attempted manslaughter and negligence for his role in the affair. Search under State Case No. 13-2017-CF-007072-0001-XX On June 15, 2017, Rios Soto's family filed a lawsuit against North Miami on his behalf alleging the police falsely imprisoned him and intentionally inflicted pain and suffering. A confidential settlement was reached in 2019. In March 2019, the case was declared a mistrial as the jury could not reach a verdict on all charges. The jurors voted to acquit Aledda of one misdemeanor count of culpable negligence for shooting at Rios Soto. However they could not reach a decision on the three remaining charges, one of misdemeanor culpable negligence for his shot at Kinsey, and two charges of felony attempted manslaughter. In June 2019, Jonathon Aledda was retried and found not guilty on two counts of attempted manslaughter (felony charges) but guilty of culpable negligence, a misdemeanor. He was not sentenced to prison, and was instead sentenced to one year of administrative probation, 100 hours of community service, and to write a 2,500-word essay on communication and weapon discharges. His conviction would also not appear on a criminal record due to the withholding of adjudication. He was released from probation less than five months later. After Aledda‚Äôs sentencing, Charles Kinsey and the City of North Miami reached a settlement for an undisclosed amount in the federal suit Kinsey had filed against the city and its police. Reactions After the release of the video, Florida Congresswoman Frederica Wilson tweeted that she was shocked and angered by Kinsey's shooting, writing, \\"Like everyone else I have one question: Why?\\" On Thursday after the shooting, Black Lives Matter activists protested outside the North Miami police department, stating that it was Kinsey who was \\"protecting and serving\\" in the incident, and confronting police officials. Protestors demanded that the shooting officer be fired. NPR wrote that the incident \\"has renewed discussions of officers' use of force\\". Abroad, France TV wrote that while the incident could have ended far more tragically, it was \\"no less absurd and worrisome\\", calling the event \\"surreal\\". Le Figaro wrote that the story broke at a time when the United States has been \\"plagued by intense controversy following the death of several black people shot by police, and attacks on five policemen.\\" References 2016 in Florida African-American history of Florida Black Lives Matter July 2016 events in the United States Law enforcement controversies in the United States Law enforcement in Florida North Miami, Florida African- American-related controversies 2016 controversies in the United States Police brutality in the United States History of racism in Florida Non-fatal shootings ","title":"Shooting of Charles Kinsey"},{"id":"51129168","text":"Chrysogorgia is a genus of soft corals in the family Chrysogorgiidae.

The team played its home games in Kelly/Shorts Stadium in Mount Pleasant, Michigan, with attendance of 96,700 in five home games.2015 Media Guide, p. 87. The highlight of the season was a 20‚Äì3 victory over No. 18 ranked Michigan State at Spartan Stadium on September 14, 1991. Michigan State had been favored by 21-1/2 points, and coach Deromedi called it the biggest win in school history. On the opening drive, Michigan State quickly took the ball to the goal line. On fourth down from the one-yard line, Michigan State opted to go for the touchdown rather than kick a field goal. Chippewa linebacker Doug Adler stopped Tico Duckett for no gain, and the goal-line stand was reported to be an inspirational moment for the Chippewas. Adler called the top \\"the biggest play I ever made.\\" Later in the first quarter, Central Michigan tailback Billy Smith scored on a 15-yard run. The Chippewas expanded their lead in the second quarter on a 57-yard touchdown pass from Jeff Bender to Ken Ealy and led 14‚Äì3 at halftime. Chuck Selinger also kicked two field goals in the second half for Central Michigan. Billy Smith rushed for 162 yards on 40 carries in the game. The team's statistical leaders included quarterback Jeff Bender with 1,754 passing yards, tailback Billy Smith with 1,440 rushing yards, and flanker Ken Ealy with 724 receiving yards.

King Melchior is shown kneeling before Child Jesus and offering his gift of gold coins. His removed crown lies at his feet. Behind him King Caspar, with his crown dangling behind his head, takes his gift of frankincense from an assistant in readiness to present it. On the left King Balthasar, portrayed as a dark- skinned king, still wears his crown and holds an orb of myrrh. In the background the retinue of each of the three magi can be seen above their heads. The magi are thus shown twice, once in the foreground and again in miniature in the background, arriving with their retinue from Africa, Europe and Asia. An x-ray examination of the underdrawing shows that originally the European retinue of Melchior had him riding a horse and this was later changed to a dromedary.

First established in 1976 and officially founded in 1980 by CEO Bob Eaton, the company is known for its monthly auctions of rare documents, manuscripts, autographs, and historic artifacts, often exceeding 1,000 lots per sale. The auction house has developed global recognition with a worldwide client base and publishes monthly catalogs in print and online via issuu.  History  In 1976, RR Auction CEO and founder Bob Eaton, then 19 years old and recently graduated from Newton North High School, purchased $1800 worth of sports memorabilia. The memorabilia included a Babe Ruth baseball and Red Sox World Series programs, and he proceeded to sell them for ten times his original purchase price. After this, Eaton established RR Auction and began to sell sports cards and signed memorabilia out of his basement, until he decided in 1980 to send out a mailing list of the items he had available for sale --- thus founding the company in Newton Centre, Massachusetts. In 1995, RR Auction switched from retail sales to auctioning and Eaton decided to bring the business to Amherst, New Hampshire, where the company has an office to this day. The first internet auction occurred the same year. At this time the company also began including items other than autographs. RR Auction launched the option for online bidding in 2004. This has contributed to the growth of the company over the years. In 2009, RR Auction brought in $8 million in annual revenue. This increased by 2014, and this same year the company opened an auction gallery in a new 1,500 square-foot facility in Boston's North End community after expanding considerably after the launch of their website. =Today= The auction house now focuses on artifacts from American history and pop culture, and these are often the themes of their online and live auctions, though autographs are still the most commonly featured item. Their auction website remains active while they still send out monthly catalogues. The mid-sized auction house registers up to $10 million in sales every year and mails out over 1,000 monthly catalogues while their online auction system draws around 6,000 visitors per week. In 2015, an unsuccessful attempt to bring a California class-action lawsuit against RR Auction was thrown out after no other individual was found to join the class;[8] the company characterized the suit as ‚Äúextortion by litigation.‚Äù[9]. The California lawsuit was dismissed in 2017. In a countersuit filed in Federal Court in New Hampshire citing the ACPA, RR Auction sought to protect its reputation and trademark against online attacks by the complainant;[10] this became the basis of an article about \\"malicious cyber-gripers\\" in the New Jersey Law Journal.[11]  Notable Items and Auctions  =Historical= *Documents connected with the Alamo, including receipts signed by William Barret Travis and Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna's map, were featured at auction in November 2011.

The style became popular in the mid to late 17th century, and it reached its peak during the 18th century, when monumental Baroque structures such as Auberge de Castille were constructed. The Baroque style began to be replaced by neoclassical architecture and other styles in the early 19th century, when Malta was under British rule. Despite this, Baroque elements continued to influence traditional Maltese architecture. Many churches continued to the built in the Baroque style throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, and to a lesser extent in the 21st century.https://susanklaiber.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/eahn2018_proceedings.pdf Background Auberge d'Italie, originally designed by Girolamo Cassar in the Mannerist style but later redecorated in the Baroque style Prior to the introduction of the Baroque style in Malta, the predominant architectural style on the island was Mannerist architecture, a variant of Renaissance architecture which was popularized in Malta in around the mid-16th century. The most notable Mannerist architect in Malta was Girolamo Cassar, who designed many public, private and religious buildings in the then-newly-built capital city Valletta. Cassar's style was somewhat austere, and many of his buildings were reminiscent of military architecture. It took about a century for Mannerism to fall out of favour and replaced by Baroque, and according to James Quentin Hughes it may have been Lorenzo Gafa who ignited the new style. Seventeenth century The Wignacourt Arch, built in 1615 by Bontadino de Bontadini According to historian Giovanni Bonello, the Baroque style was probably introduced in Malta by the Bolognese architect and engineer Bontadino de Bontadini in the beginning of the 17th century. In July 1612, Bontadini was entrusted with the construction of the Wignacourt Aqueduct, a project which was completed on 21 April 1615. The aqueduct's decorative elements, namely the Wignacourt Arch, three water towers and several fountains, are probably the earliest representations of the Baroque style in Malta. Hostel de Verdelin, a mid-17th century example of Spanish Baroque architecture in Malta However, according to Leonard Mahoney, it was Francesco Buonamici who introduced Baroque architecture in Malta. In either case Buonamici is accredited for popularizing Baroque after he designed the Church of the Jesuits in Valletta in 1635. Romano Fortunato Carapecchia has managed to transform Valletta from a mainly Mannerist style to a significant Baroque style.https://www.um.edu.mt/library/oar/bitstream/handle/123456789/40464/Ephemeral_manifestations_in_Baroque_Malta_2011.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed;=y In the subsequent decades, many new Baroque buildings began to be constructed by the Order of St. John, while some existing buildings were redecorated or given new fa√ßades. Early examples of Maltese Baroque buildings include Auberge de Provence (renovated 1638) and Hostel de Verdelin ( 1650s). Most Baroque buildings in Malta were influenced by Italian or French Baroque architecture, but a few have characteristics typical of the Spanish Baroque. St. Paul's Cathedral in Mdina, designed by Lorenzo Gaf√† and built between 1696 and 1705 From the 1660s onwards, many churches began to be constructed in the Baroque style, and they were characterized by large domes and belfries which dominated the skyline of the towns and villages. One of the most well-known and influential architects of Maltese Baroque was Lorenzo Gaf√†, who designed many churches between the 1660s and the 1690s. Gaf√†'s masterpiece is St. Paul's Cathedral in Mdina, which was rebuilt between 1696 and 1705 after the original medieval cathedral was damaged in the 1693 Sicily earthquake. Other notable Baroque churches designed by Gaf√† include the Church of St. Lawrence in Birgu (1681‚Äì97) and the Cathedral of the Assumption in Victoria, Gozo (1697‚Äì1711). Meanwhile, many existing churches were redecorated in the Baroque style. The interior of Saint John's Co-Cathedral, then the Order's conventual church, was extensively embellished in the 1660s by the Calabrian artist Mattia Preti, although the Mannerist exterior was retained. Eighteenth century Fort Manoel, a Baroque fortress built between 1723 and 1733 The Baroque style was the most popular architectural style in Malta throughout the 18th century. Examples of Baroque buildings from the first half of the century include the Banca Giuratale in Valletta (1721), Fort Manoel in G≈ºira (1723‚Äì33) and Casa Leoni in Santa Venera (1730). Palazzo Vilhena in Mdina, designed by Charles Fran√ßois de Mondion in 1726‚Äì28 An example of Baroque town planning was Charles Fran√ßois de Mondion's redesign of the former capital city of Mdina in the 1720s. Many medieval buildings within the city had been damaged in the earthquake of 1693, so in 1722 the newly elected Grand Master Ant√≥nio Manoel de Vilhena initiated a building programme under the direction of Mondion. The fortifications were strengthened and many public buildings were built, and at this point significant French Baroque elements were introduced, including the Main Gate (1724), the portal of Greeks Gate (1724), the Torre dello Standardo (1725), Palazzo Vilhena (1726‚Äì28), the Banca Giuratale (1726‚Äì28) and the Corte Capitanale (1726‚Äì28). Castellania, designed by Francesco Zerafa High Baroque was popular throughout the magistracy of Manuel Pinto da Fonseca, and buildings constructed during his reign include Auberge de Castille (1741‚Äì45), the Pinto Stores (1752) and the Castellania (1757‚Äì60). Auberge de Castille was designed by the Maltese architect Andrea Belli, and it replaced Girolamo Cassar's earlier Mannerist building. The auberge's ornate fa√ßade and the steps leading to the doorway were designed to be imposing, and it is regarded as the most monumental Baroque building in Malta. Nineteenth, twentieth and twenty- first centuries Mellieƒßa Parish Church, built between 1881 and 1898 in the Baroque style Neoclassical architecture and other architectural styles were introduced in Malta in the late 18th century, and they were popularized when the island was under British rule in the early decades of the 19th century. Despite the introduction of these new styles, Baroque remained popular for the nobility's palaces, and Baroque features began to appear in traditional Maltese townhouses, such as Casa Nasciaro. The Baroque style remained the predominant style for most Maltese churches throughout the 19th and most of the 20th centuries. Examples of these include the Mellieƒßa Parish Church (1881‚Äì98) and the Rotunda of Xewkija (1952‚Äì78). A few churches built in the 21st century still include significant Baroque elements, such as the Santa Venera Parish Church which was constructed between 1990 and 2005. Historian Giovanni Bonello ranks Maltese Baroque as one of the three \\"treasures\\" of Maltese architecture, along with the megalithic temples and the fortifications.

Arthat Valiyapally also called Paloor-Chattukulangara Church is an ancient church located in Arthat village of Thalapilly Taluk, one mile south of Kunnamkulam town, Thrissur, Kerala, India.This is the first and the oldest church in India founded in AD 52. This church is also known as Chattukulangara pally. It is believed that this church is the most ancient church in this region and is one of the Seven and Half church founded by St Thomas Apostle in AD 52. This church did not participate in the Synod of Diamper. During the invasion of Tippu Sultan the church was arsoned and later reconstructed. History The tradition states that St Thomas came to a region near present-day Kunnamkulam called Paloor or Judakkunnu (Yahuda kunnu) where Jews were colonized. He preached gospel to the Jews and many were converted to Christianity. The Jewish Synagogue in that area was later converted to a Christian church. This church was known as Chattukulangara pally. When St Thomas came to Judakunnu (Jew hill), there occurred a water scarcity in that area at that time. People were in great distress and they appealed to St Thomas for help. He whipped on the land on the top of the hill and there appeared a spring of fresh water. This was later called Chattakkulam. (ml:‡¥ö‡¥æ‡¥ü‡µç‡¥ü‡¥ï‡µç‡¥ï‡µÅ‡¥≥‡¥Ç ) and the church near to it came to be known as Chattakkulangara pally. After the Synod of Diamper, Aleixo de Menezes made a visit to Arthat Church whom didn't attend the Synod and submitted to Menezes. His visit was to allure and subjugate Arthat Church to the Latin leadership. However the native people strongly opposed it and loudly shouted to express their protest. In 1789 Tippu Sultan attacked and arsoned this church. It is said in folklores that Tippu's army killed a priest in the Altar room of this church and the blood spilled over there. Since it was considered impure, some part of the Altar was cut and removed. Hence this church was also called as Vetti muricha pally(ml:‡¥µ‡µÜ‡¥ü‡µç‡¥ü‡¥ø ‡¥Æ‡µÅ‡¥±‡¥ø‡¥ö‡µç‡¥ö ‡¥™‡¥≥‡µç‡¥≥‡¥ø ) or cut altar church. Even now the Altar of this church remain distinct from other churches. After the Coonan cross oath, those who made allegiance to the Roman Catholic church (Syro-Malabar Catholic Church) wanted to take over the church to their fold and because of the dispute the church was closed for a while. In 1805 with the request of the Malankara Nasranis, the then King of Cochin, Sakthan Thampuran himself came to Arthat church to resolve the problem. Both parties agreed for a lucky draw. In the lucky draw the main church and buildings were gone to the Malankara Syrians and the Stone cross of the church gone to the Syro-Malabar Catholic Church. In 1800 Francis Buchanan visited this church and met Ittoop Malpan,(Pulikkottil Joseph Mar Dionysious I / Mar Dionysius II). In 1806 the Arthat Padiyola (resolution) declared to break all the chains of Rome,Babel & Antioch. In 1808 Dr.Claudius Buchanan & Colonel Macauley made a visit and awarded a large gold medal to this principal church in the name of all Syrian churches in Malayalam. This church has the largest cemetery(1 hectare) of all churches in Kerala. The present cemetery wall was built with the initiative of Geevarghese Mar Gregorios of Malankara. The largest cemetery in Kerala Visit of Dr.Claudius Buchanan & Colonel Macauley, 1808 Church architecture The church was earlier built in Kerala Architectural style thatched with coconut palm leaves. During the attack of Tippu Sultan the church was arsoned. Later the church was restructured with wooden roof, thatched with clay tiles. Mar Dionysius II when he was a Ramban was instrumental in restructuring the church in the present state. The present structure was built during 1805-1827 CE. Chattukulangara pally In 1772, Kattumangattu Bishop sent a letter to Sakthan Thampuran (Sakthan thampuran page 289) which states, in Thalappilli there was only one church existing in that region, which is the Chattukulangara palli . There were 2 more chapels also present in that region viz. 1.Chiralayam 2. Pazhanji (dedicated to Geverghese sahada).

It aims to preserve and present the art, history, and culture of the Moravians in America, and it is the third oldest historical society in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The Society is housed in the 1740/1743 Whitefield House on the Ephrata Tract in downtown Nazareth. The Society is affiliated with the Moravian Archives in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, the repository for records of the Moravian Church in North America, Northern Province. The Society collects objects relating to Moravian history in North America, provides research assistance, publishes, and offers lectures, programs, events, and activities for all ages and levels of interest.  Site  The Society owns three acres of land in Nazareth, PA, called the Ephrata Tract. It was on this site that the First House of Nazareth once stood. It operates out of two buildings on the Tract: the 1740/1743 Whitefield House and the 1740 Gray Cottage. = Ephrata Tract = In 1740, a Moravian group from Savannah, Georgia was hired by landowner and British cleric George Whitefield to build a school for orphaned slaves. Whitefield wanted to build his school on a 5000-acre area he called Nazareth, which he had purchased from William Allen that same year. Tensions arising from theological disputes between Whitefield and the Moravians led the Moravians to purchase and begin to establish Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, leaving Whitefield's school building unfinished. When Whitefield later went bankrupt, the Moravians purchased the 5000 acres, which included the Gray Cottage, First House, and the bottom portion of the Whitefield House. This area became known as the Ephrata Tract. The town of Nazareth was laid out in 1771 several blocks to the west. The First House was demolished in 1864, but the Whitefield House and Gray Cottage still stand. The buildings were added to the National Register of Historic Places on May 1, 1980. The marker for the Moravian Historical Society = Whitefield House = Construction on the Whitefield House started in 1740 and completed in 1743. It was originally used to house 32 married couples arriving from England. Through the years, the Whitefield House operated as a place of worship, girls‚Äô boarding school, nursery, the Moravian Theological Seminary, and apartments for furloughed missionaries. Today, the Whitefield House houses the Society's museum, administrative offices, and gift shop. The museum runs a series of permanent and changing exhibitions showcasing the culture of the Moravians and their contributions to American history. = Gray Cottage = The Gray Cottage was constructed in October 1740 by the Moravians as protection from the harsh winter weather ahead. It is an oak log structure, and was originally called the ‚ÄúOld Block House‚Äù from the German word Block, meaning ‚Äúlog.‚Äù From 1743-1745, the building was used as a boys‚Äô school. It has also been used as a girls‚Äô school, a home for widows, a nursery, and a private residence. It is the oldest Moravian building still standing in North America. = First House = The marker designating the First House of Nazareth Constructed in June 1740, the First House sheltered Moravians during the construction of the Whitefield House. It was approximately 30‚Äô wide by 20‚Äô deep, and stood two and one half stories tall. It was demolished in 1864, but the foundation was discovered by archaeologists in September 2014 in the area between the Whitefield House and the Gray Cottage. Several artifacts including redware pottery and a brass horse bell were also discovered. A small stone marker stands on this site.

Biography  Shalom Ronli-Riklis was born in 1922 in Tel Aviv. As a young man, Riklis learned to play the violin and the piano. His piano teacher Vincze-Kraus taught at the Rubin Academy of Music in Tel Aviv University. During his studies at the Hebrew Gymnasium \\"Herzliya,\\" he learned to play the trumpet and later, the French horn, which would become his main instrument. After graduation, he joined the Jewish Brigade. Following a period of service in the infantry, Riklis joined the Orchestra Brigade. Shortly before his release from the Brigade, he was appointed the orchestra conductor. After his release from the Brigade, Riklis graduated from the Academy of Music in piano and conducting. There he took courses under Igor Markevitch at the Mozarteum University of Salzburg from 1953‚Äì56. = His IDF service = Riklis served in the War of Independence, as a member of the first unit of the military police. In 1949 he was invited to conduct the Israel Defense Forces, IDF, orchestra that had been founded shortly beforehand. He served as conductor of the IDF orchestra for 11 years, until stepping down in 1960. During that time, Riklis significantly improved the quality of the IDF brass band. This was the first full brass band in Israel. Under his leadership, it became a prominent musical ensemble in Israel. Many of its members in the brass and percussion sections were among the first Israelis to join the Israel Philharmonic orchestra. IDF at the time was the only army in the world who had two orchestras: the symphonic orchestra, founded by Riklis, and a wind ensemble. The symphonic orchestra toured the country, while the wind ensemble played military parades, light music, and Jazz. His great love was working with teenagers. During his tenure with the IDF Orchestra, he developed the Youth Corps as its conductor. The youth ensemble would go on to win first prize, which was a silver harp, at the Queen Juliana competition for orchestras in Kerkrade, Netherlands, which was attended by over 100 bands. The youth ensemble won three times in a row: 1958, 1962 and in 1966. After three consecutive first prizes, the harp remained permanently in Israel and has been stored in the IDF archives. This band toured in 1967 under his Riklis' baton in the United States and Canada with American star Danny Kaye. They were met with great success. = After his army service = After leaving the army, he worked for many years at the Israel Radio Orchestra in Jerusalem. Riklis headed the faculty and conducted the Chamber Orchestra of the Academy of Music in Tel Aviv University. He is credited with teaching many generations of musicians in Israel. In 1961, he was sent by the Singapore Foreign Ministry to build and consolidate the country's classical music. As part of this work he established a symphony orchestra and worked with various youth orchestras. In 1971, he was appointed deputy of the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra by Zubin Mehta, and in 1984, he founded the Young Philharmonic Orchestra; he remained as its director until 1988. Dozens of his students went on to perform with various orchestras worldwide. Riklis conducted many orchestras in Israel. He also served as a mentor to various musicals and judged numerous music competitions. In 1990 he was the first European to win the Silver Star of Singapore. Riklis died in January 1994 in Tel Aviv, after a long illness. He is buried in the Yarkon Cemetery.

Muskat refined Darcy's equation for single phase flow, and this change made it suitable for the petroleum industry. Based on experimental results worked out by his colleagues, Muskat and Milan W. Meres also generalized Darcy's law to cover multiphase flow of water, oil and gas in the porous medium of a petroleum reservoir. The generalized flow equation provides the analytical foundation for reservoir engineering that exists to this day.  Early life and career Muskat was born in Riga, Russian Empire. He came to the United States with his family in 1911, and became an American citizen in 1914. Muskat attended Marietta College and Ohio State University, then taught physics at Bowling Green University. He earned his doctorate in physics from the California Institute of Technology in 1929. After graduating from CalTech, Muskat joined Gulf Research & Development Company where he started as a Research Engineer and worked his way up to get the position as Chief of the Physics Division, a position he held until 1951. He took a one-year break from Gulf, during World War II, to serve as chief of the Acoustics Division of the Naval Ordnance Laboratory. In 1951 he became technical coordinator of the Production Department, Gulf Oil Corporation in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Dr. Muskat served as the Vice Chairman of the Petroleum Branch of AIME (now the Society of Petroleum Engineers in 1953. In 1961 he was promoted to Technical Adviser to the Executive Group of Gulf Oil, a position he held until his retirement in 1971. Muskat received many honors, including the American Petroleum Institute's Certificate of Appreciation (1965) and Special Scroll (1971), the Society of Petroleum Engineers's Lester C. Uren Award (1969), the American Institute of Mining, Metallurgical, and Petroleum Engineers's Lucas Medal (1953) and honorary (life) membership (1972), membership in the National Academy of Engineering (1983), and CalTech‚Äôs Alumni Distinguished Service Award (1987). He also has fifteen U.S. patents in various fields of science and engineering. In his later years Muskat withdrew from professional life and relocated to Pasadena, California, where he died on June 20, 1998, at the age of 92.  Research and publications  Muskat refined the original version of Darcy's equation for single-phase fluid (or homogenous fluid in Muskat terminology) flow by introducing fluid viscosity in the equation, as pointed out earlier by Charles Sumner Slichter,Slichter C.S.; Theoretical investigation of the motion of ground waters; U.S. Geol. Surv. (1897-1898), 19th Ann. Report Part 2, pp 295-384. and replacing the hydraulic head by pressure and gravity force. The proportionality constant of the porous medium (which were both unconsolidated sand and consolidated sandstone in the laboratory experiments), using the new refined equation, is called single- phase permeability or absolute permeability, and is now a pure rock property as the fluid viscosity is explicit in the new flow equation. The pressure and gravity force link the refined equation to basic properties in physics, which makes the connection to capillary pressure, and thus Leverett J-function, direct and makes the connection to fluid density visible in the new equation. By these refinements Muskat established a refined flow equation for single phase fluid flow that is valid for water, oil and gas, and thus is suitable for use in the petroleum industry. Muskat and his colleagues verified the new equation by experiments. Another problem that faced Muskat and his colleagues, is that an oil reservoir has large horizontal dimensions, and production wells are spread all over it. Where will the oil flow? Today the reservoir engineer will use numerical reservoir simulation to answer that question. In the 1930s there were no computers, so Muskat turned to experimental analogues to fluid flow such as heat flow and electric current. Again Muskat refined Darcy's equation by generalizing to three equations for the three space dimensions, as pointed out earlier by Philipp Forchheimer.Forchheimer P. 1914; Hydraulik; Book published by B.G. Teubner, Leipzig und Berlin, 1914, p 437. The single- phase permeability was generalized to be a 3x3 tensor which is usually represented by a diagonal tensor where the vertical permeability differ from the two horizontal permeabilities. In 1937 Muskat published The Flow of Homogeneous Fluids Through Porous Media. In this book Muskat focused on flow of single-phase fluid in a porous medium, and what type of differential equation can be used to model this flow behavior. Large emphasize is put on discussing results of experimental analogues such as heat flow and electric current. This book also presents and refers to experimental findings made by his colleagues. An oil reservoir usually has an aquifer below the oil leg, and sometimes also a gas cap above the oil leg. As oil is produced from the oil leg, water and gas will flow into this zone where some oil is still flowing. The operating company may also inject water or gas into the oil reservoir in order to increase oil recovery. The equations for reservoir dynamic must therefore include multi-phase flow of water, oil and gas. As water flow from below and gas flow from above the oil leg, the local mixture of fluid phases will usually only be two phases. Muskat, with assistance of geophysicist Milan W. Meres (1906-1963), analyzed results from the steady-state and the transient flow experiments of Ralph Dewey Wyckoff and Holbrook Gorham Botset. The experimental results showed that the flow of a mixture experienced an effective permeability that was reduced compared to the single-phase permeability. The reduced permeability correlated non-linearly with volume fraction of the other phase, and the reduction factor (or function) is denoted relative permeability. The formulation is based on Muskat's theory that the porous medium has a local structure of macroscopic size that is defined by the saturations, or volume fractions, of the fluid mixture. Muskat included the new permeability-reducing parameter in the refined single-phase flow equations, and thus established a new differential equation that governs the flow of multi-phase fluids in porous media. The experimental findings of Wyckoff and Botset and the analytical / theoretical findings of Muskat and Meres were published as two coordinated papers in 1936. In 1949 Muskat published Physical Principles of Oil Production, which advanced the field of reservoir dynamics and reservoir engineering, compared to his 1937 book, and provided the analytical foundation for reservoir engineering that exists to this day.

TWDP models fading due to the interference of two strong radio signals and numerous smaller, diffuse signals. TWDP is a generalized system using a statistical model to produce results. Other statistical methods for predicting fading, including Rayleigh fading and Rician fading, can be considered as special cases of the TWDP model. The TWDP calculation produces a number of fading cases that the older models do not, especially in areas with crowded radio spectrum. Fading Fading is an effect that occurs in many radio- related contexts. It occurs when a signal can take more than one path to a receiver, and the signals are effected differently along the two paths. The simplest case is when one path is longer than the other, but other delays and effects can cause similar results. In those cases, when the two (or more) signals are received at a single point, they may be out of phase, and thus potentially suffer from interference effects. If this occurs, the total signal received can be increased or decreased, but the effect is most noticeable when it makes the signal completely unreceivable, a deep fade. The effect had been noticed from the start of radio experimentation, but was especially notable with the introduction of shortwave communications. It was identified as being due to self-interference due to multiple paths between the transmitter and receiver, which in turn led to the discovery and characterization of the ionosphere. This layer of the atmosphere is reflective, causing the signal to return to the Earth where it can reflect back into the sky, and in this way \\"skip\\" for long distances over the ground. This provided multiple paths to the receiver, with (for instance) a strong signal received after one reflection off the ionosphere and a weaker one after two reflections. The seemingly random fading effects were traced to the slow movement of billows in the ionosphere and the daily variation due to the effects of sunlight.  Modelling fading  Attempts to model the effects of fading started almost immediately after the effect was first characterized. Earlier models included simplifications in order to make the math tractable. Rayleigh fading is named for its use of the Rayleigh distribution of the signal. This is, in effect, the 2D distribution that results from the product of X and Y components that are separately and randomly distributed according to a normal distribution. By varying the parameters of the distributions, one can model different real- world cases. This model is useful when both of the signals are roughly equal in amplitude, as is the case when there is no direct line-of-sight between the transmitter and receiver. Rician fading is similar but uses the Rice distribution instead of Rayleigh, which is characterized by two parameters, shape and scale. This system is most useful when one of the paths is stronger, especially in line-of-sight applications. A more general solution was long sought that did not require arbitrary limits on the distributions or envelopes. The first general solution was presented in 2002 by Durgin, Rappaport, and de Wolf. The new method used the KŒî parameter to characterize the distribution. The new system predicts a number of deep fading scenarios that are not found in the older methods, notably Rayleigh. Jeff Frolik was the first to measure TWDP fading in an aircraft fuselage, coining the term hyper- Rayleigh to denote this and other fading scenarios that result in worse-than- Rayleigh received power outages for a radio link. Subsequently, other researchers have developed alternate, improved expressions for the TWDP distribution and its statistics. Recently, TWDP fading has been discovered for directional and vehicular millimeter wave channels. The formulation of TWDP fading has upended classical RF design by providing a new \\"worst case design\\" scenario in fading in wireless links. Thus, common performance metrics in mobile communications such as bit error rate, outage probability, diversity gains, etc. can be significantly degraded by TWDP fading. Both measurements and theoretical predictions have shown that TWDP fading becomes more common as mobile radio links increase in both frequency and density.  Channel characterization  PDFs and CDFs for Rayleigh, Rician (K=13 dB), and TWDP (K=13 dB, Œî=1) fading. TWDP fading arises in a radio channel characterized by two constant-amplitude waves and numerous, smaller radio waves that are randomly phased with respect to one another. A TWDP-distributed envelope R follows from the following combination of elementary random variables: :R = V_1e^{j2pi U_1} + V_2e^{j2pi U_2} + X + jY where U_1 and U_2 are independent uniform random variables over the interval [0,1); X and Y are independent, zero-mean Gaussian random variables with standard deviation sigma. The two constant amplitude components are referred to as the specular components of the fading model. The X+jY term represents the sum of numerous amplitudes and phases of smaller waves, which by the law of large numbers follows a complex Gaussian distribution. TWDP fading PDF is characterized by three parameters: average power Œ©, ratio of specular-to-diffuse power K, and disparity between specular components Œî. These three parameters are related to the amplitudes of the individual waves by :Omega = V_1^2 + V_2^2 + 2sigma^2 qquad K = frac{V_1^2 + V_2^2}{2sigma^2} qquad Delta = frac{2V_1V_2}{V_1^2 + V_2^2} The K-factor may vary from 0 to infty. A value of K=0 corresponds to Rayleigh fading. A value of K=infty corresponds to the type of two-wave envelope fading experienced on a transmission line with reflections. The Delta parameter varies from 0 to 1, with Delta=0 corresponding to Rician fading and Delta=1 corresponding to specular components of equal amplitude, V_1=V_2. Unlike its special cases of Rayleigh and Rician fading, there is no simple, closed-form solution for the probability density function (PDF) of received envelope for TWDP fading. Instead, the exact PDF is the result of the following definite integral: : f_R(rho) = rho int_0^infty J_0(rho u) J_0(V_1 u) J_0(V_2 u) e^{-frac{ u^2 sigma^2}{2}}, u , d u Numerous techniques have been proposed to approximate the TWDP PDF in closed form or evaluate its statistics directly.

Galizia as Superintendent of Public Works in 1880 Emanuele Luigi Galizia (7 November 1830 ‚Äì 6 May 1907) was a Maltese architect and civil engineer, who designed many public buildings and several churches. He is regarded as \\"the principal Maltese architect throughout the second half of the nineteenth century\\". Victoria Gate in Valletta Our Lady of Sorrows church at the Addolorata Cemetery, Paola Villa Alhambra in Sliema Turkish Military Cemetery in Marsa Biography Galizia graduated as a civil engineer and architect from the University of Malta, and in 1846 entered government service as an apprentice of William Lamb Arrowsmith. He became government perito in 1856 and, four years later, the chief perito, being responsible for all the government's public works. He became Superintendent of Public Works in 1880, which came with a seat on Malta's Legislative Council. Galizia was made a knight of the Order of St. Gregory the Great by Pope Leo XIII, and he became a member of the Order of the Medjidie during Sultan Abd√ºlaziz's visit to Malta in 1867 in recognition of Galizia's completion of the Turkish Military Cemetery in Marsa, which was commissioned by the Sultan. He became a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1886, and a fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1888. That year, the government sent him on a tour of Italy, France and England to broaden his knowledge of Gothic Revival architecture, and possibly also to provide advice on Tower Bridge in London (completed in 1894), and the Victorian restoration works at the Brighton Pavilion. Galizia was also an examiner at the faculty of civil engineering at the University of Malta. He was also commissioned by the Imperial Government to visit Cyprus soon after the British occupation of the island and report upon its possible colonisation. The first visit was made in conjunction with Sir Adrian Dingli and Professor Schinas; subsequently he travelled in the company of Marquis Testaferrata Olivier. The reports of the visits and surveys were printed and published under the authority of the Government at the time.An Institute of Civil Engineers obituary published in 1907 praised his \\"tact and affability [which] endeared him to the whole community, whilst the ability and thoroughness which he displayed in all his work gives him a permanent place in the record of professional achievement in Malta.\\" According to Derek Moss, Galizia > \\"adopted an exotic and flamboyant arabesque style with horseshoe arches and > carvings which he applied to building three large terraced single storey > houses (Alcazar, Pax, Alhambra) in Rudolf Street on the main access into the > heart of Sliema. These were the first scheduled houses in Sliema, surrounded > by fields, which dominated the rural landscape, and were seen from afar. He > also designed the Police Station at the Ferries landing place and St. > Gregory‚Äôs church. The Diana fountain erected in St Anne Square to > commemorate the supply of fresh water to Sliema is also by Galizia‚Äôs hand. > Today this stands in Balluta square.\\"Sliema's Built Heritage, FAA Personal life James became Superintendent of Public works, like his father before him, and then Treasury Secretary in Malta's imperial administration. His second son Godwin, also an architect, was known for his neo-Romanesque architecture such as the Church of Saint Peter in Birzebbugia and the Church of Saint Gregory in Sliema, but his works until recently received less attention than those of his father. Godwin was also appointed by private families to design chapels and mausoleums at the Addolorata Cemetery, which was designed by his father.

It was destroyed by arsonists following direction from the local Ku Klux Klan chapter known as the Christian Knights of the Ku Klux Klan and was later rebuilt afterwards. Four Klansmen were convicted for the crime, and a subsequent civil suit effectively closed the Klan chapter's operation in the county. The successful civil suit was called a \\"wake-up call\\" indicating that racial violence would not be tolerated.  Background  In 1994 the Christian Knights of the Ku Klux Klan (a South Carolina branch of the Ku Klux Klan) set up headquarters in a field near the church, proclaiming that black churches taught their congregations how to manipulate the welfare system and procure government subsidies. The church congregation could hear the Klan's sermons blaring from the building next door on megaphones.  Arson and investigation  On June 21, 1995, Timothy Adron Welch and Gary Christopher Cox of the Christian Knights of the Ku Klux Klan poured gasoline on the floor of the Macedonian Baptist Church and set it on fire. The church was one of several rural black churches burned by arsonists in the mid-1990s. The crimes prompted president Bill Clinton to visit South Carolina in 1996 and pledge federal help in investigating the crimes. Due to the possibility that the arson violated federal civil rights hate crime laws, the arson case was investigated by the FBI. Welch and Cox were apprehended in connection to a stabbing assault on a black man on June 16. The two were charged with assault and battery with intent to kill, first- degree arson, and second-degree burglary of the Mount Zion AME Church in Greeleyville, SC.  Trials  = Criminal trial = Welch, Cox, and two older accomplices, Arthur Haley and Hubert Rowell were indicted on several charges of civil rights violations involving the burning of the Macedonian Baptist Church and other racially charged crimes. Haley and Rowell were also charged with burning a Hispanic migrant camp in Manning, SC, burning a car of a black Manning resident, and illegally possessing firearms. The federal indictment said that Haley selected the Macedonian Baptist Church as the arson target and Rowell instructed Cox and Welch on how to set the fire. All four defendants pleaded guilty to the charges. They received federal prison sentences ranging from 12 to 21.5 years. James E. Johnson and Isabelle Katz Pinzler, co-chairs of the National Church Arson Task Force commended the work of officials and investigators in the case. Rene Josey, U.S. attorney for the District of South Carolina, said \\"Today's sentences should serve as a wake-up call to those individuals who may consider the unlawful use of force and violence to intimidate persons based on their race and religious beliefs.\\" The sentences for Cox and Welch were reduced to 12 years in prison for testifying in the civil suit against the Klan. = Civil suit = A subsequent civil case trial was held in 1998 with the charges that the Ku Klux Klan incited the crime. The case was brought to court by the Southern Poverty Law Center, represented by attorney Morris Dees. The lawyer for the Klan insisted that the criminals acted alone in burning down the church. Defense attorney Gary White painted the Klan Grand Dragon Horace King as a feeble old man merely exercising his right to free speech, saying King never authorized the arson. During the trial, the Church's lawyers showed racist Klan posters and literature and played a videotape for the jury showing King speaking at a Klan rally, saying \\"It's time, people, to wake up and shape up and say this is our country, white people, take it back.\\" The Klan leaders insisted that they never encouraged anyone to break the law, but two of the sentenced arsonists testified against their case. Welch testified, \\"The church fire was Klan business, and we were told we would not go to jail. We were convinced we were untouchable.\\" Both Welch and Cox said that they testified against the Klan to atone for what they'd done. The case was decided by nine black and three white jurors. On July 24, 1998, the jury deliberated for just 45 minutes before it returned a decision that the Ku Klux Klan must pay $37.8 million, $12.6 million more than even lawyers for the church requested. The verdict included $300,000 in actual damages and $37.5 million in punitive damages. King was ordered to pay $15 million, as was the Christian Knights of the Ku Klux Klan Inc. of North Carolina. The Christian Knights' South Carolina affiliate was ordered to pay $7 million, while the four men in prison were ordered to pay $100,000 to $200,000 each. The judgement was the largest ever awarded against a hate group. The amount was later reduced to $21.5 million. King's \\"tiny house, a shed, a chicken coop and seven acres in rural Lexington County\\"https://web.archive.org/web/20160821054956/http://chronicle.augusta.com/stories/1998/08/06/met_235223.shtml were sold, and he died in the early 2000s.  Aftermath  On the day the verdict was read, Welch's younger brother Richard stated that he blamed the Klan for changing his brother. He said he was happy with the verdict, and hoped that it would be enough to keep the Klan away from their town. The civil suit forced the Klan to surrender the land on which its headquarters were built. When the property was sold, the deed included a restriction that the land never be used for white supremacist activities. The SPLC credits this judgement with reducing \\"one of the most active Klan groups in the nation to a defunct organization.\\" After the suit, King stated publicly that he was sorry anyone ever connected with his group was involved in the arson, he refused to admit personal guilt or apologize for inciting the crime. He claimed that he would continue to fight to proclaim his innocence. The Macedonian Baptist Church was later fully rebuilt. Forgotten Fires, a film about the fires and subsequent trials was produced by Michael Chandler & Vivian Kleiman in 1998. The church and trials were discussed in Standing on Holy Ground, a book by Sandra E. Johnson about the spate of arsons targeting black churches in rural South Carolina.

Most typical are his interior scenes but he also painted a number of scenes of vendors selling their wares. Characteristic of his works are the sharply delineated figures.Tavern Scene at the National Inventory of Continental European Paintings His genre scenes are regarded as promoting bourgeois virtues. Continuing in the steps of his father he recreated the atmosphere of his age in a multitude of small paintings that are pleasantly animated and have an old-fashioned charm.

Engine failure and damage sustained in the consequent emergency landing prevented the 28VD from participation in the race. Design and development The Kellner-B√©chereau 28VD was designed to compete in the 1933 Coupe Deutsch, a race around a circuit from Etampes in two flights separated by a refuelling stop. Engines of less than were stipulated; the Delage 12C.E.D.irs engine of the 28VD just met this limit. The 28VD was a low wing, cantilever monoplane. Its wing span was small (; a wing area large enough to keep the wing loading to values comparable to those of World War II fighter aircraft designed a few years later produced an aspect ratio of only 4.2. In plan the wing was carefully faired into the fuselage and had a swept, straight leading edge, rounded tips and a curved trailing edge entirely occupied by ailerons. There were two spars, one perpendicular to the fuselage at mid-chord and one at an angle bearing the ailerons. Its fuselage was slender, with a rounded cross-section. The water-cooled, double- supercharged, inverted V-12 Delage engine drove a large diameter, two blade propeller. Its radiators were in the wing. There were two on each side, one inboard and one outboard, both occupying the full chord and forming the wing skin. An open cockpit was placed a little in front of the trailing edge of the wing, within a narrow dorsal fairing which stretched over half the fuselage, starting close to the nose. The fuselage tapered rearwards to a conventional tail, with a round-tipped triangular tailplane, mounted at mid-fuselage, which had an adjustable angle of incidence. Its vertical tail was tall and slightly rounded and the unbalanced rudder extended down to the keel. The landing gear of the 28VD had retractable mainwheels, mounted on shock absorbing forward- raked, parallel legs from the wing. These were hinged to the lower fuselage on opened U-shaped frames. Retraction was vacuum-powered; to raise the wheels the tops of the legs were translated outward, swinging frames and wheels upwards. The tailskid was fixed to a small ventral extension of the fuselage under the fin. The 1933 Coupe Deutsch de la Meurthe was scheduled to start on 28 May and each aircraft had to make a flight at more than over a course in the period 8‚Äì14 May to participate. The 28VD arrived at Etampes on 3 May to be flown by Vernhol; it is not known how much flying it had done before that, though it was only completed a fortnight before the competition. The early days of the test period were occupied with the refinement of the 28VD but on the 12‚Äì13 May it was reported to have engine problems. During the early tests it was decided to set a finer propeller pitch as the initial setting was producing to much drag on the engine. When the aircraft attempted its qualifying flight on the last allowed day, this change of setting allowed the engine to overspeed. As a result, a rubber joint in the cooling system failed, releasing a cloud of vapour which temporarily blinded the pilot and forced an emergency landing in which the undercarriage collapsed and the aircraft overturned. Vernhol was thrown clear and was not seriously hurt but the 28VD was too damaged to take part in the contest for which it was built.

He has developed computer tools dedicated to crystallographic refinement and computer manipulation of nucleic acids.Westhof E, et al., ¬´ Crystallographic Refinement of Yeast Aspartic Transfer RNA, ¬ª, J. Mol. Biol., (1985), 184, p. 119-145 These have led to excellent three-dimensional RNA structures. For more than a decade, these tools have been used by nucleic acid crystallographers in many countries. At a time when only the structure of the transfer RNA was known, he and Fran√ßois Michel proposed a three-dimensional model of the structure of the core of group I autocatalytic introns.Michel F, et al., ¬´ Modelling of the Three-dimensional Architecture of Group I Catalytic Introns Based on Comparative Sequence Analysis, ¬ª, J. Mol. Biol., (1990), 216, p. 585-610 Ten years later, crystallography confirms the architecture of the model, thus offering a vast field of new applications in structural biology. Folding of other ribozymes (hepatitis delta virus, ribonuclease P, hairpin ribozyme) has also been proposed. Several years after these publications, independent crystal structures have shown the accuracy of the architecture of the folds and interactions responsible for self-assembly. His expertise in RNA structure modeling has led him to collaborate with several groups. Thus, with F. Eckstein and T. Tuschl, the first model of the hammer-headed ribozyme was produced on the basis of fluorescence data.Tuschl, T., et al., ¬´ A three- dimensional model for the hammerhead ribozyme based on fluorescence measurements ¬ª, Science, (1994), 266, p. 785-789 With Dr. Kochoyan, the first models of RNA aptamers modelled from nuclear magnetic resonance data were presented.Yang, Y., et al., ¬´ Structural basis of ligand discrimination by two related RNA aptamers resolved by NMR spectroscopy ¬ª, Science, (1996), 272, p. 1343-1347 With W. Filipowicz and F. Kolb, a DICER double-stranded RNA binding and cleavage model explaining the maturation of microRNAs has been published.Zhang, H., et al., ¬´ Single processing center models for human Dicer and bacterial RNase III ¬ª, Cell, (2004), 118(1), p. 57-68 Analysis of crystallographic structures and comparisons with theoretical models then made it possible to establish predictive rules for RNA folding. With Neocles Leontis, Eric Westhof proposed an ontology of pairs between nucleic acid bases that allows automatic annotation of crystal structures and bioinformatic research of structured regions in RNA sequences;Leontis NB, et al., ¬´ RNA Geometric nomenclature and classification of RNA base pairs ¬ª, RNA, (2001), 7, p. 499-512 This structural bioinformatics work by the RNA has made it possible to identify a set of constraints in sequence allowing architectural models of RNA. This set of rules and constraints, which can be read from sequence alignments and manipulated by computer, allows them to deduce RNA architectures, which is essential for our understanding of the function and structural evolution of RNAs. Eric Westhof has extended his physico-chemical, structural and dynamic studies of RNAs to functional and evolutionary aspects, as well as to the prediction of strong and specific molecular interactions with molecules of therapeutic interest. The crystallographic structures of many complexes between aminoglycoside antibiotics and the site A of the 30S particle of eubacterial ribosomes Vicens Q, et al., ¬´ Crystal structure of paromomycin docked into the eubacterial ribosomal decoding A site ¬ª, Structure, (2001), 9,, p. 647-658 clearly show the origin of the binding specificity and resistance induced by these aminoglycosides. Recently, with Marat and Gula Yusupov and their collaborators, a detailed understanding of decoding errors due to tautomeric forms of the pairs between G and U has been demonstrated.Demeshkina, N., et al., ¬´ A new understanding of the decoding principle on the ribosome ¬ª, Nature, (2012), 484 (7393), p. 256-259 Westhof, E., et al., ¬´ Recognition of Watson-Crick base pairs: constraints and limits due to geometric selection and tautomerism ¬ª, F1000Prime Rep, (2014), 6, p. 19 In parallel with Henri Grosjean, a new representation of the genetic code anchored in ribosome structures related to messenger RNA and transfer RNA and integrating the very numerous observations on the effects of changes in transfer RNAs is of great interest.Grosjean, H., et al., ¬´ An integrated, structure- and energy-based view of the genetic code ¬ª, Nucleic Acids Res, (2016) 44, p. 8020-8040 Other articles based on the analysis of crystallographic and bioinformatic structures have generated a large number of citations. In 1984, Eric Westhof and Marc van Regenmortel's team demonstrated a correlation that proved to be central in immunochemistry: antigen epitopes generally have greater mobility than the less immunogenic regions of proteins.Westhof E, et al., ¬´ Mondragon A, Klug A, Van Regenmortel MHV, Correlation between Segmental Mobility and the Location of Antigenic Determinants in Proteins ¬ª, Nature, (1984), 311, p. 123-126 With Pascal Auffinger, the importance and specificity of halogen atom-mediated bonds in biological macromolecules and nucleic acids was established.Auffinger, P., et al., ¬´ Halogen bonds in biological molecules. ¬ª, Nature, (2004), 101(48), p. 16789-16794 Finally, with the Genolevures consortium,Dujon, B., et al., ¬´ Genome evolution in yeasts ¬ª, Nature, (2004), 430(6995), p. 35-44 they annotated the non-coding RNAs of yeasts in addition to the coding genes and compared them between yeasts.  Nucleic acid base pairs  The natural bases of nucleic acids form a great variety of base pairs with at least two hydrogen bonds between them. These hydrogen bonds can occur between atoms belonging to any of the three edges of the nucleic acid edges. The possible combinations lead to a classification in twelve main families, with the Watson-Crick family being one of them. In a given family, some of the base pairs are isosteric between them, meaning that the positions and the distances between the C1‚Äô carbon atoms are very similar. The isostericity of Watson-Crick pairs between the complementary bases forms the basis of RNA helices and of the resulting RNA secondary structure (covariation). In addition, several defined suites of non-Watson-Crick base pairs assemble into RNA modules that form recurrent, rather regular, building blocks of the tertiary architecture of folded RNAs. RNA modules are intrinsic to RNA architecture are therefore disconnected from a biological function specifically attached to a RNA sequence. RNA modules occur in all kingdoms of life and in structured RNAs with diverse functions. Because of chemical and geometrical constraints, isostericity between non- Watson-Crick pairs is restricted and this leads to higher sequence conservation with coevolution (neutral networks) in RNA modules with, consequently, greater difficulties in extracting 3D information from sequence analysis.  Tautomerism and recognition of nucleic acid base pairs  Nucleic acid helices are recognized in several biological processes like during nucleic acid replication or ribosomal translational decoding. In polymerases and the ribosomal decoding site, the recognition occurs on the minor groove sides of the helical fragments. With or without the use of alternative conformations, protonated or tautomeric forms of the bases, some base pairs with Watson-Crick-like geometries can form and be stabilized. Several of these pairs with Watson-Crick-like geometries extend the concept of isostericity beyond the number of isosteric pairs formed between complementary bases. These observations set therefore limits and constraints to geometric selection in molecular recognition of complementary Watson-Crick pairs for fidelity in replication and translation processes.  Ribosomal decoding fidelity and efficiency  The basic principles of mRNA decoding are conserved among all extant life forms. We present an integrative view all the complex interaction networks between mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA : the intrinsic stability of codon- anticodon trimers, the spatial conformation of the anticodon stem-loop of tRNA, the presence of modified nucleotides, the occurrence of non-Watson-Crick pairs in the codon-anticodon helix and the interactions with bases of rRNA at the decoding site. We derive an information-rich, alternative representation of the genetic code table. The new organization of the 64 codons is circular with an asymmetric distribution of codons that leads to a clear segregation between GC-rich 4-codon boxes and AU-rich 2:2-codon and 3:1-codon boxes. The advantage of integrating data in this circular decoding system is that all tRNA sequence variations can be visualized, within an internal structural and energy framework, for each organism and anticodon. Within this new representation, the multiplicity and complexity of nucleotide modifications, especially at positions 34 and 37 of the anticodon loop, segregate meaningfully and correlate well with the necessity to stabilize AU-rich codon- anticodon pairs and to avoid miscoding in split codon boxes. This structure- based network of interactions results in an energetically uniform decoding of all tRNAs that can adapt to the cellular constraints. The evolution and expansion of the genetic code is viewed as originally based on GC content with the progressive introduction of A/U together with tRNA modifications and the modification enzymes. This allows for a great diversity of codon usage depending on GC content of the genome and on the number and types of tRNAs. The representation should help the engineering of the genetic code to non- natural amino acids. In summary, in order to maximize the diversity in codon usage without increasing the numberf different tRNAs (for decoding the 61 sense codons), cells developed sophisticated arrays of tRNA modifications that are anchored in cellular metabolic enzymatic pathways. The genetic code is not translated universally and several differences exist between organisms and in the three kingdoms of life. In each organism, there is a very strong connectivity between the elements responsible for the reliability and efficiency of the decoding process of the genetic code. The multiplicity of these highly interconnected elements and the integration of the various biological information flows ultimately allow for the maintenance of subtle cellular homeostasis and place the processes of translation at the center of cellular activities.

It was located at the confluence of the Columbia and Spokane rivers and was used to separate the Colville and Spokane tribes on their reservations from the newly established city of Spokane. The fort was last used in 1929 and was later incorporated into the Lake Roosevelt National Recreation Area and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. History =Background= The US Army stationed troops at White Bluffs on the Columbia River, at Foster Creek on the Okanogan River, and at Spokane Falls to manage potential unrest amongst the Colville, Spokane, and Palouse peoples. The troops at White Bluffs and Foster Creek were moved to a post south of Lake Chelan in 1878, closer to Chief Moses. Difficult to supply, Camp Chelan was abandoned and the troops moved to a new site, Camp Spokane. After the Colville Reservation was established in 1982, and the Spokane Reservation in 1881, the US Army assumed policing responsibilities until 1890. =Use as an outpost= Fort Spokane was founded in the fall of 1880 by Lt. Colonel Henry C. Merriam and Second Infantry Regiment as Camp Spokane. It was renamed Fort Spokane in 1882. The Fourth Infantry Regiment took over in 1886, and the Sixteenth Infantry Regiment in 1896. Fort Spokane was strategically located at the convergence of the Columbia River and the Spokane River about 50 mile west- northwest of the city of Spokane, it was the last army frontier post established in the Northwest. In 1884 there were about 25 buildings, including six barracks, a schoolroom, an ice house and a two-story administrative building topped with a glass-sided cupola. Eventually there were about 50 buildings built on the post which included officers' quarters, enlisted men's barracks, a hospital, chapel, post headquarters, morgue, quartermaster warehouses, shops, stables, and post trader store. The post served to consolidate older posts like Fort Colville closer to the population areas, and as a buffer between the Indian reservations and settlers in the area. When the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War broke out in 1898 the troops at Fort Spokane were moved elsewhere and the fort was turned over to the Colville Indian Agency. In 1899 the post became a boarding school for Indian children until 1914, when the post became a tuberculosis sanatorium for the next 15 years. The site was abandoned by the government in 1929. =Preservation and restoration= The National Park Service took over the site in 1960 with only four original buildings remaining from the fort. Four buildings and the site have been preserved and are now part of the Park Service's Lake Roosevelt National Recreation Area. The restoration has saved the 1884 stable, the 1888 powder magazine, the 1889 reservoir and the 1892 guard house.

March Term 1848. Motion for New Trial. S.M. Bay attorney for plaintiffs. Samuel Mansfield Bay (June 1, 1810 ‚Äì May 29, 1849) was an American lawyer who represented Dred Scott in the 1847 Scott v. Emerson case. Bay served in the Missouri Legislature and was appointed as Missouri Attorney General from 1839 to 1845.  Early life  Bay was born in Hudson, New York in 1810. He attended Hudson Academy, where he studied Latin, Greek, and math. Bay's father and grandfather were both lawyers. His father was a contemporary of Martin Van Buren and his grandfather worked at the firm of Ambrose Spencer, who was a judge on the Supreme Court of New York for many years. Samuel Bay had a brother, William Van Ness Bay. Bay often visited his uncle, Dr. Joseph Lovell in Washington City, who was surgeon-general of the United States army. Bay stayed in Washington for about two years, where he attended a private school and was taught by Salmon P. Chase. Chase held many political offices, including governor of Ohio, United States senator, secretary of the treasury under President Lincoln, and chief justice of the Supreme Court. After finishing school, Bay returned to New York and became a clerk in a large French importing house. The firm sent him to Europe on business for five or six months. While away, Bay decided to study law.  Legal career  When Bay returned to the United States from Europe, he traveled to Ohio, where Judge Swayne, a Supreme Court Justice, asked Bay to read law (study) with him in his office. Shortly after his return he also visited Columbia, South Carolina, where he met his grand-uncle, Judge Elihu H. Bay who spent forty-nine years as a judge on the South Carolina Supreme Court. President Jefferson offered Judge Bay a seat on the United States Supreme Court, but he declined. According to Bay's brother William, Samuel Bay's visit with his uncle strongly influenced his desire to become an attorney. Senate election of Samuel Mansfield Bay as attorney general. February 3, 1841. Courtesy of the Missouri State Archives. After completing his studies, Bay moved to Union, Missouri. He was elected to the Missouri Legislature in 1836. When his term in the Legislature ended, Bay moved to Jefferson City, where he established a law practice. He was appointed to the position of Missouri attorney general by Governor Boggs. Bay held the position of attorney-general from 1839 to 1845. Bay earned a wide reputation for his prosecution of Dedimus Buell Burr (1813-1842), who was convicted and executed for the murder of his wife Sally. Sally, Burr's third wife, had fallen ill and died after suffering from a fever for several weeks. Doctors were unable to explain the illness, but there was no suspicion of foul play until one of Burr's apprentices in his blacksmith shop said he believed Burr had been putting pounded glass in his wife's medicine, eventually killing her. Although the funeral procession for Burr's wife was already underway, the body was returned to the city for a post mortem examination, where the examiner found a large quantity of pulverized glass in the woman's stomach. Burr was arrested, but many thought he would be acquitted. Bay found that Burr refused to have anyone else administer medicine to his wife and had also had two previous wives die under similar conditions. The defense could not overcome this argument and Burr was convicted. Before being executed, Burr admitted that he was guilty of this murder and the other two and said he was simply tired of each wife and wanted another. Bay had a partnership with Abiel Leonard in Jefferson City until 1846 or 1847. Around that time, Bay moved the practice to St. Louis and was appointed attorney for the State Bank.  The Dred Scott Case  In 1847, Dred Scott made his first legal contest for freedom in St. Louis, Missouri. Judge Alexander Hamilton presided over the case and Samuel M. Bay acted as Scott's attorney. Francis B. Murdoch was the Scotts' original attorney and filed three suits against Irene Emerson, Dred and Harriet's former owner for trespass and false imprisonment. Murdoch was replaced by Charles D. Drake. More than a year passed from the time of Scott's first petition filed with the court and by the time the case was ready for trial, Drake had left St. Louis, in May or June 1847. Drake prepared the case, but Bay handled the proceedings in court. To argue his case, Bay needed to prove that Scott had been taken into a free state and that he was presently a slave owned by Irene Emerson. Bay established that Scott had been a slave taken into free territory, brought back to Missouri, and was being held there as a slave. Testimony attested to this fact, establishing that Scott was Irene Emerson's slave in Missouri and had accompanied her to Forts Armstrong and Snelling. It was also established in testimony that Mrs. Emerson still claimed Scott as her slave in Missouri. Bay thought at this point he had all the evidence to secure Scott's freedom. However, the defense argued that Scott had not legally proven that Mrs. Emerson was claiming him as a slave. During cross examination of Samuel Russell, who had testified that he hired Scott from Mrs. Emerson, thus establishing her ownership of Scott, Russell admitted that it was in fact his wife who had hired Scott. Russell's testimony was dismissed as hearsay. The Scotts lost their case. Irene Emerson was allowed to keep Dred and Harriet as slaves because no one could prove that they were her slaves. After waiting on the case for a year, the Scotts were ultimately denied their freedom. Although the Dred Scott case is well known today, Dred Scott v. Irene Emerson did not incite much reaction in St. Louis or any other part of the country. The litigants involved were not well known, nor did the case involve controversial principles of law. Only one St. Louis newspaper mentioned the case, and only in a daily list of cases in the city courts.  Later Life & Death  Bay died relatively young and was survived by a widow, three sons, and a daughter. He died of cholera in the 1849 epidemic.

It is a small oil on canvas painting measuring 48.9 √ó 77.5 cm. It now hangs in the reading room of the Frick Art Reference Library alongside the Regatta in Venice. Both paintings were gifted to the Frick Collection by Helen Clay Frick after her father's death. In the painting, Guardi captures a typical scene of Venetian life on the canals. In this particular veduta, Guardi depicts a section of the northern bank of the Cannaregio Canal, one of Venice‚Äôs largest canals, located in the Cannaregio sestiere (district) of the city. The Palazzo Surian Bellotto is the most prominent building in the painting, named after the two different families who owned the palace: first the Surian family and then the Bellotto family. The Ponte dei Tre Archi connects the northern bank with the small fragment of the southern bank. The bridge‚Äôs arch acts as a viewfinder, focusing the viewer‚Äôs gaze onto the tiny patch of pure blue, breaking up the otherwise entirely urban landscape. Another building that features in this view is the Santa Maria delle Penitenti. It is recognizable by its circular window below the roof and placement behind the Ponte dei Tre Archi. This church was designed by Giorgio Massari in 1725 and the fa√ßade was never completed. Guardi takes care to ensure its recognizability despite its modest appearance.

Jeffrey Kluger, in his 2014 book The Narcissist Next Door suggested that our society, still largely patriarchal, is more likely to tolerate male narcissism and aggressiveness than these of females. This assertion was voiced, although without definite proof, by a number of other researchers. In 2015 a number of media outlets reportedJeffrey Kluger, \\"Why Men Are More Narcissistic Than Women\\"\\"Proof at last: men really are bigger narcissists than women\\" about a study at the University of Buffalo which analyzed 31 years of data of narcissism research and concluded that men consistently scored higher in the first two of three aspects of the Narcissistic Personality Inventory: leadership/authority, exploitative/entitlement, and grandiose/exhibitionism.\\"Study: Men tend to be more narcissistic than women\\", A University of Buffalo news release, March 4, 2015\\"Gender differences in narcissism: A meta-analytic review.\\", Grijalva, Emily; Newman, Daniel A.; Tay, Louis; Donnellan, M. Brent; Harms, P. D.; Robins, Richard W.; Yan, Taiyi, Psychological Bulletin, Vol 141(2), Mar 2015, 261-310. (article text available from DigitalCommons@University of Nebraska-Lincoln) The team leader of the research, Emily Grijalva, commented that on average this difference is slight (a one-quarter of a standard deviation) and there was almost no difference in the exhibitionism dimension (which covers such aspects as vanity, self- absorption and attention-seeking). She notices that a similar degree of difference is observed for other personality traits, e.g., slightly higher neuroticism for women or slightly higher risk-taking for men.\\"Narcissism increases the chance you'll be seen as a leader, especially if you're a man\\", Emily Grijalva, Monday 9 March 2015, The Guardian The reasons of reported gender difference were outside the scope of the study, however the authors speculated that it is rooted in historically established social conventions about what is acceptable for a particular gender and what are the traditional social roles for genders. A number of earlier studies (on smaller scales) reported similar bias.Joshua D. Foster, W. Keith Campbell, Jean M. Twenge, \\"Individual differences in narcissism: Inflated self-views across the lifespan and around the world\\", Journal of Research in Personality, Volume 37, Issue 6, December 2003, Pages 469‚Äì486, . Quote: \\"The results suggest that (1) reported narcissism declines in older participants, (2) consistent with previous findings, males report being more narcissistic than females, (3) that ethnic differences in reported narcissism are generally comparable to those found in the self-esteem literature, and (4) that world region appears to exert influence on narcissism, with participants from more individualistic societies reporting more narcissism.\\" A further indication for the trend was a 2008 finding that the lifetime narcissistic personality disorder is more prevalent for men (7.7%) than for women (4.8%).Grijalva et al.

Academic career  Dutton completed his DPhil at the University of Oxford before teaching Arabic at its Faculty of Oriental Studies from 1993 to 1995, Arabic and Islamic studies at the University of Edinburgh from 1995 to 2006, and Arabic at the University of Cape Town from 2006 to 2018. Research Dutton's research into early Islamic law focused on the jurisprudence of Malik ibn Anas and his use of the practices of the people of Medina (amal ahl al-madina) as a source of law. He is of the view that in addition to the Quran, amal ahl al-madina was an overruling authority for Malik, more so than hadith. Using the issue of the placement of hands during prayer, i.e. sadl vs qabd, Dutton makes a distinction between the sunnah as preserved by amal and the sunnah as preserved by hadith.

Since the 1960s, Miller has shot and collected an impressive number of Fluxus related materials, including the 1978 Interview with George Maciunas. The interview that Miller conducted with Maciunas shortly before the latter's death is an outstanding documentation, which has made a great contribution to the reconstruction of early Fluxus history in particular.Hendricks, Geoffrey.

Miller and Seagull met in the early 1970s under the mutual influence of Fluxus artist Robert Watts who taught film and mixed media at Rutgers University from the 1950s to the 1980s and remained a lifelong friend of both artists. Miller's performance residencies have included Portland School of Art, Maine; Lafayette College, Easton, Pennsylvania; Walker Art Center, Minneapolis; and Santa Barbara Museum, California and has taught and lectured at colleges and universities throughout the country. In 1986, Miller was the subject of a retrospective and catalogue, As If the Universe Were An Object at the Anderson Gallery, Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond and Washington Project for the Arts, Washington, D.C. Miller and Seagull live in New York City. They maintain a studio near New Paltz, NY. Work with Fluxus Miller's official association with the Fluxus group dates to 1969 when the founder of the group George Maciunas took him on as a protege, leading to close collaborations. Many of Miller's original compositions have become part of the Fluxus collective's standard repertoire of works. Miller has become a frequent interpreter of \\"classic\\" Fluxus scores and is credited with enlarging the group's works to a wider audience, often straddling the boundaries between research, art, and producer.Bloch, Mark.\\"Flux-Labyrinth: an Interview with Larry Miller\\" New York City 2015. http://artistorganizedart.org/commons/2015/06/flux-labyrinth-larry-miller.html Through Miller, Fluxus attracted media coverage such as the worldwide CNN coverage of Off Limits exhibit at Newark Museum, 1999.Marter, Joan M. and Anderson, Simon.

Because when we did it we were trying to engage all these aspects of experience‚Äî aural, optic, olfactory, epithelial and tactile,\\" Miller told post-Fluxus artist Mark Bloch in a 2015 interview. \\"The fundamental idea behind the Flux-Labyrinth is Maciunas was taking that essential idea of the puzzle of consciousness... and trying to translate it in basic 20th Century terms which to me were existential.\\" Miller created a new version of the Flux Labyrinth at the In the Spirit of Fluxus exhibit at the Walker Art Center in 1994, where Griel Marcus said, \\"Miller was... fine tuning the monster.\\"Marcus, Griel.

During the opening night of George Brecht - A Heterospective at Museum Ludwig, Cologne in 2005, Miller organized fellow Fluxus artists Alison Knowles, Ben Vautier and others to convey the ideas behind Brecht's original \\"event\\" scores in a performance program that embodied the subtleties of the genre including a rare reenactment of Brecht's 1960 Motor Vehicle Sundown (Event) For John Cage, featuring more than 40 vehicles in the historic Dom Platz adjacent to the famous Cologne cathedral the following day. With a large local audience in attendance, the event spectacle, broadcast live on German television, utilized fire trucks, police and military vehicles and vintage automobiles as sound instruments to bring Brecht's classic score to life.

A notable contribution to the spirit of Fluxus-related works by Miller has been the \\"Flux-Tour\\", a form of performance whereby artist-performers conducted alternative museum and gallery tours in which guides focused attention to the architectural spaces themselves rather than discussing or interpreting works of art on display, resulting in the examination of minute detail such as the floors, structural elements and lighting present in the spaces.

Beginning in 1861, he also attended classes at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts; passing his final exam in 1866. He began to have showings at the Charlottenborg Spring Exhibition and in 1869 was awarded the Neuhausenske Prize (De Neuhausenske Pr√¶mier) For several years, he worked to perfect a method to improve the reproduction of drawings by printing press.

She also served in the state Senate and, under President Franklin Roosevelt, in the Federal Bureau of Narcotics. She was inducted into the Rhode Island Heritage Hall of Fame in 2014. Early life and education Isabelle Florence Ahearn was born in 1880 in Woonsocket, Rhode Island, the youngest of thirteen children of Mary J. (O'Connor) Ahearn and Daniel Ahearn. She was raised in Providence, Rhode Island, and was educated at the Boston College of Drama and Oratory. She also took physical education classes at Harvard University. She married John Aloysius O'Neill in 1907; they had one child who died as an infant. The couple separated after three years but did not divorce because she was a Catholic. Stage and film career O'Neill began her career as a teacher, founding her own Ahearn School of Elocution in 1900, at the age of 20. Her students gave recitals at the Providence Opera House. Ahearn also worked as an actor for nearly two decades (1900‚Äì18), taking both lead and supporting roles in primarily summer stock and vaudeville shows in Rhode Island and New York. In 1915, she began to take roles in silent films like Joe Lincoln's Cape Cod Stories (Joseph C. Lincoln's Cape Cod Stories) made by the Providence-based Eastern Film Corporation. Career in government In the 1910s, O'Neill became an active suffragist and began to campaign for Democratic candidates in Rhode Island. She eventually left the stage and took her elocutionary skills into a career in politics. In 1922, she was elected to the Rhode Island House of Representatives from the 15th Assembly District, making her the first woman to hold office in the Rhode Island Legislature. She stayed in the House for eight years, supporting better protections for women in the workplace, better pay for teachers, and pensions for widows with children. A canny public speaker, she gave speeches in French and Italian to reach a broader cross-section of the electorate. She rose to the position of deputy Democratic floor leader before moving over to the state Senate in 1932. In 1924 she served as the temporary chair of the Democratic National Convention. At the request of President Franklin Roosevelt, she left the state Senate after only two years to serve as the president's legislative liaison to the Federal Bureau of Narcotics. In 1943, she resigned and returned to her home state, where she took an executive position at the Rhode Island Labor Department. O'Neill retired in 1954 and died in 1975. Her papers are held by the Rhode Island Historical Society and include scrapbooks from her years as an actor and elocution teacher, as well as a brief autobiographical sketch. Honors and awards The resolution passed by the Rhode Island House of Representatives recognizing March 8, 2007, as \\"Women's History Day\\" specifically mentioned Ahearn's accomplishment in becoming the state's first woman legislator \\"just two short years after women gained the right to vote\\". In 2011, the YWCA of Rhode Island created the Isabelle Ahearn O‚ÄôNeill Award in her memory to honor the state's women leaders. In 2014, she was inducted into the Rhode Island Heritage Hall of Fame.

Bogard examines the effects of this loss on human physical and mental health, society, and ecosystems, and how it might be mitigated. The book has been translated into Chinese, German, Japanese, Korean, and Spanish. Synopsis The nine chapters of Bogard's book map to the nine levels of the Bortle scale, which attempts to quantify the subjective brightness and suitability for astronomy of the sky in different environments. Bogard has said of the scale, invented in 2001, \\"one of the reasons why identifying different depths of darkness is so important is that we don‚Äôt recognize that we‚Äôre losing it, unless we have a name to recognize it by.\\" Bogard begins at a Bortle level 9 environment, by the Luxor Sky Beam, the brightest spotlight on Earth, located on the Las Vegas Strip. He explores the nighttime landscapes of London and Paris, and examines the planning, or lack thereof, in each city's lighting. He visits locations throughout the continental US, as well as Florence, the Canary Islands, and the isle of Sark, in his quest to understand the nature of light pollution. He experiences firsthand the deleterious effects of night shift work, talks with a former prison inmate about the psychological effects of uninterrupted light, and shares his own fear of the dark. Bogard ultimately finds a Bortle level 1 environment: an environment so perfectly free of stray light that the Milky Way casts noticeable shadows. Bogard argues against the long-held assumption of a correlation between bright light and reduced crime, citing research that finds no such link. Rather than suggesting a return to the completely unlit nights of centuries past, however, he argues for a careful consideration of where and how light is deployed, in order to provide sufficient nighttime illumination for safety, without creating glare and other unwanted effects. Reception Telegraph reviewer Stephanie Cross wrote that \\"the appeal of Bogard‚Äôs book derives not just from his often wide-eyed enthusiasm for his subject, but also from the constellation of characters he encounters on his journeys into the night.\\" In The Guardian, novelist Salley Vickers wrote that \\"Bogard sets about his investigations with an energetic purposiveness and enterprise,\\" but complained that \\"the book comes to seem a little thin, moving too rapidly from one chatty anecdotal meeting to another.\\" The Wall Street Journal questioned Bogard's statements on the relationship between light and safety, and concluded ambivalently: \\"The End of Night delivers a forceful, if incomplete, critique of our overexposed world.\\" =Awards= The book was awarded the 2014 Nautilus Silver Award. It was named an Amazon Best Book of the Month and Nonfiction Editor's Pick for July 2013, and Gizmodo selected it as one of its Best Books of 2013. The book was shortlisted for the PEN/E. O. Wilson Literary Science Writing Award, and was a finalist for the Sigurd F. Olson Nature Writing Award.

The river signifies the split between the Northern and the Southern Netherlands that occurred with the Beeldenstorm. In the original painting the Protestant fishermen had successfully fished up some believers while the Catholic nets were empty. The \\"souls\\" near the Catholic boats were added later. On the left bank are the two princes of Orange behind an orange tree branch; Maurice and Frederick Henry. They are accompanied by Frederick V, Elector Palatine, King James I of England and the young Louis XIII of France with his mother Maria de' Medici. On the right bank of the river are the Catholic cardinals carrying their pope accompanied by Albert and Isabella. The various attributes of the fishermen (nets, boats, etc.) are labelled with Latin text to clarify the meaning. A large fly is painted on as a trompe l'oeil wink to Jan Brueghel the Elder who created many similar amusing allegories with visual jokes in them. Provenance This painting can be seen hanging in a 19th-century sketch of the gallery of the Trippenhuis before the collection was moved to its present location in 1885 This painting has been considered a highlight of the collection since it was bought in 1808 and has been included in all Highlights of the Rijksmuseum catalogs. It was appropriated for the national art collection in September 1798 during the French occupation for the National Kunst Galerie in the Hague, from the collections of Prince Willem V. This appropriation was a tactical move to secure certain works from being abducted by the French to Paris, which had happened with the larger part of Prince Willem's gallery in 1795 after the prince fled to England.

He showed very promising form in his four races as a juvenile in 1992, winning the Group Three Vintage Stakes and finishing a close second in the Group One National Stakes. He had problems with injuries as a three-year-old and won one minor race from only two starts in the autumn. As a four-year-old he ran consistently, finishing second in the Brigadier Gerard Stakes, International Stakes and Park Stakes but appeared to be just below top class. On his final appearance however, he produced by far his best performance as he led from the start and won the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes at odd of 66/1 from opponents including Barathea, Bigstone, Distant View, Turtle Island, East of the Moon and Sayyedati. He was retired to stud at the end of the year and had some success as a sire of winners in New Zealand. He died in 1999. Background Maroof was a bay horse bred in Kentucky by his owner Hamdan Al Maktoum's Shadwell Farm. His sire Danzig, who ran only three times before his career was ended by injury, was a highly successful stallion who sired the winners of more than fifty Grade I/Group One races. His offspring include the champions Chief's Crown, Dayjur and Lure as well as the important stallions Green Desert and Danehill. Maroof's dam Dish Dash was a high-class racemare who won the Ribblesdale Stakes at Royal Ascot and finished third in the Yorkshire Oaks in 1982. She became equally successful as a broodmare with her other descendants including Desert King and the Oaks d'Italia winner Contredanse. Hamdan Al Maktoum opted to race Maroof in Europe and sent him into training with Robert Armstrong at his St Gatien stable in Newmarket in Suffolk. He was ridden in ten of thirteen his races by the Scottish jockey Willie Carson. Racing career =1992: two-year-old season= Maroof began his racing career in a maiden race over five furlongs at Lingfield Park Racecourse on 20 June. Starting at odds of 4/1 in a nine-runner field he took the lead after two furlongs and won by a length from Young Ern (later to win the Hungerford Stakes). In July he was moved up in distance for the Black Duck Stakes over six furlongs at York Racecourse and finished second of the three runners, beaten half a length by the Paul Cole-trained favourite Splendent. At the end of the month the colt was moved up in class and distance for the Group Three Vintage Stakes over seven furlongs at Goodwood Racecourse. He started at odds of 8/1 in a ten-runner field with his opponents including the Chesham Stakes winner Humam (the 4/1 favourite), Ancestral Dancer (a three-time Listed race winner in Italy) and Port Lucaya (later to win the Premio Vittorio di Capua). Maroof turned into the straight in fifth place behind the outsider Persian Revival, took the lead a furlong out, and won by a length and a half from Humam. On 19 September, Maroof was sent to Ireland and stepped up to the highest class for the Group One National Stakes over seven furlongs at the Curragh Racecourse and started 9/4 second favourite in a five-runner field. He took the early lead and set a steady pace before accelerating a quarter of a mile from the finish but was caught in the closing stages and beaten half a length by the Vincent O'Brien-trained favourite Fatherland. =1993: three- year-old season= Maroof had training problems in 1993 and missed the spring and summer before returning in September for a minor race over one mile at Newbury Racecourse. Ridden by Richard Hills he started the 7/4 favourite and led for most of the way before winning by one and a half lengths from Redenham. In October he was sent to France for the Group Two Prix du Rond Point over 1600 metres on heavy ground at Longchamp Racecourse. He finished third behind Voleris and Alflora with the favourite Gold Splash back in eighth place. =1994: four-year-old season= Maroof began his third season in the Lockinge Stakes at Newbury on 13 May and finished fifth of the eleven runners, six lengths behind the winner Emperor Jones. Later that month he was moved up in distance for the Brigadier Gerard Stakes over ten furlongs at Sandown Park Racecourse and finished second to Chatoyant. He was then sent to Ireland for the International Stakes at the Curragh on 26 June. He raced in second behind Alflora before taking the lead a furlong out but was caught in the final stride by the rallying Alflora and beaten a short head. The colt was dropped to Group Three class over ten furlongs at Ayr Racecourse in July and finished fourth behind Beneficial. In August he was back in Ireland and started favourite for the Desmond Stakes but ran poorly and beat only one of his nine opponents in a race won by Bin Ajwaad. Richard Hills resumed his partnership with Maroof in the Park Stakes at Doncaster Racecourse on 8 September. He led for most of the way before being caught in the final strides and beaten a neck by the four-year-old gelding Soviet Line. Hills retained the ride when Maroof returned to Group One level for the first time in over two years for the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes on good to soft ground at Ascot on 24 September. He was widely expected to serve as a pacemaker for his owner's more fancied runner Mehthaaf, winner of the Irish 1,000 Guineas who was ridden by Carson. The rest of the nine-runner field looked exceptionally strong, including Distant View, East of the Moon, Turtle Island, Ski Paradise (Prix du Moulin), Bigstone, Barathea and Sayyedati with Maroof the complete outsider at odds of 66/1. Hills sent Maroof into the lead from the start and set the pace from Distant View and Sayyedati whilst the other runners were restrained by their jockeys. In the straight Maroof showed no signs of weakening and stayed on \\"gamely\\" to win by one and a quarter lengths and a length from Barathea and Bigstone. Immediately after the race Robert Armstrong said \\"He has had an unlucky season, he was very well, he had his ground and the only amazing thing to me was the price. I thought he'd run a big race, and I backed him\\". On his retirement from training in 2000, Armstong explained \\"Willie Carson always said Maroof needed to be held up, but Richard Hills, who rode him a lot of work, said: \`This horse wants be allowed to run'. We tried it at Doncaster, just before Ascot, and he was only just beat. In the QE2 I knew that if he could accelerate twice in the straight he'd win, and he did just that-eight Group 1 winners behind him and not the trace of a fluke about it.\\" Stud record Maroof was retired from racing to become a breeding stallion at the Cambridge Stud in New Zealand. He had early problems with fertility which led an insurance claim before he was bought back by the stud's owner Patrick Hogan. His fertility improved and he became quite successful, with his best offspring included Natural Blitz (Hong Kong Sprint), Maroofity (Manawatu Sires Produce Stakes), Figures (Champions Mile), Majestically (Summer Cup (ATC)) and Beat The Fade (Emancipation Stakes). He died of a ruptured blood vessel on 30 December 1999.

In 1920 he graduated Tokyo Imperial University and entered Imperial Japanese Navy as an Engineer officer. Military career Seiji Naruse started his military career on July 21 (1920) in Yokosuka Naval District as an engineer of naval weapons. Then, he was promoted to the position of assistant division chief at the Kure Naval Arsenal on December 23, 1922. The year 1925 was a major turning point for him. He was promoted to the position of development management officer in the Imperial Japanese Navy Technical Department, and sent to the United Kingdom from May 20, 1925 to October 15, 1926. The purpose of this tour of duty was obtaining aerial torpedo technology, which did not exist in Japan at that time. Therefore, he diligently visited arsenals in the UK. After he returned, he began a project to develop the first (and last) domestic Aerial torpedo. He started development of this aerial torpedo at the Yokosuka Naval Arsenal on May 1, 1927. On December 1 (1930), he moved to the Combined Fleet for the examination of the prototype. Finally, he engaged the production and subsequent deployment of the completed ‚ÄúType 91 torpedo‚Äù as the development management officer in the Imperial Japanese Navy Technical Department from December 1, 1931. He and his team continuously improved the Type 91 torpedo at the Yokosuka Naval Arsenal (from December 1, 1932), the Kure Naval Arsenal (from July 1, 1936), and the Yokosuka Naval Air Technical Arsenal (from June 15, 1940). There were multiple revisions. On April 1 (1943), the Imperial Japanese Navy created the Torpedo Development Division for him, and he worked as the director of this new division until the end of World War II. During the World War II, the Type 91 torpedo was used as a main weapon for Naval warfare, affixed to and deployed from the underbelly of aircraft. =Dates of Rank= *Lieutenant Junior Grade (July 21, 1920) *Lieutenant (December 1, 1922) *Lieutenant Commander (December 1, 1927) *Commander (November 15, 1933) *Captain (November 15, 1938) *Rear Admiral (March 1, 1944) Post war On September 30 (1945), with the dissolution of the Imperial Japanese Navy (following the Surrender of Japan), Seiji Naruse retired from his post.

Chieftainship On the death of the McGovern chief, his uncle Maghnus 'Ruadh' M√°g Samhradh√°in in 1408, Tom√°s took the chieftaincy and moved to the chief‚Äôs residence in Ballymagauran. In 1427 his brother Brian died. The Annals of the Four Masters for 1427 state- Brian, son of Farrell Magauran, son of the chieftain of Teallach Eachdhach (Tullyhaw), died.

John was attended by only seven persons, while his opponents were forty; and being overpowered by numbers, he was thus slain. Maguire, i.e. Thomas, proceeded with a great host into Teallach Eachdhach, to take vengeance on the inhabitants for the death of his kinsman. He plundered, spoiled, and ravaged the territory, and slew many of the chiefs of it. He also burned Ballymagauran, and then he returned home in triumph.

Brian Blind-eye, son of Mag Samradhain, that betrayed him and Brian himself and a multitude of his people fell the same day by John, in expiation of their evil proceeding. And John was there with but seven and Brian was there with two score, or three score. Mag Uidhir, namely, Thomas, son of Thomas, went with a large host into Tellach-Eathach to avenge his kinsman upon them. The country was therefore successfully harried and burned by him and the town of Mag Samradhain and the donjons of the country likewise were burned by him on that occasion. And many of the magnates of the country were slain by Mag Uidhir on that occasion. Mag Uidhir returned to his house on that expedition after triumph of victory and overthrow and so on.

The Annals of Loch C√© for 1457 state- Mac Samhradhain, i.e. Thomas, died. Family Tom√°s had several consorts who bore him children. Whether he was legally married to all of them is unknown. The earliest seems to have been Barduib√≠ √ì' Imaire who bore him two sons, Brian C√°ech (d. 1431) and Tighearn√°n. His next consort seems to have been the daughter of Corman Mac Tadhg who bore a son Maol Sheachlainn Dubh (d. 1455).

The cash security system that is based on identifiable banknotes, was invented and first introduced in 2014 by AI-specialised British-Austrian technology company EDAQS. The system claims that its MRC or RFID-equipped banknotes and other securities are registered to a centralized and safe system and can be considered as unforgeable, which contributes to solve cash-related problems and helps in the fight against the black economy, crime and terrorism. One of the main goals of DICE is that the whole banking and retail sector, as well as all entities with regular cash circulation will participate in this passively controlled cash system. In a second note, the DICE procedure is meant to be an alternative to the abolition of cash by offering all benefits of a cashless economy, while driving down the global crime of violently obtaining cash. Similar to the IBNS, registered DICE banknotes that have been neutralized, cannot be brought back into circulation and can be directly linked to a crime related issue.  Concept  The concept relies on the registration of banknotes through connected readers called DICE clouds. A fast registration of the banknote through the DICE-cloud device, which does not influence the day-to-day business in terms of time delay, offers a full protection of the registered cash assets for the DICE user. During the registration-procedure, the DICE user will be informed about the legitimacy of the incoming banknote and warned, whether the banknote is part of a crime, is forged or has been degraded for a certain reason. Once the banknote has been successfully assigned to the user‚Äôs account, a robbery but also a destruction of the banknote through other catastrophes, such as a fire or a flood, would result in an executive remote devaluation of the notes. The victim would receive new banknotes. DICE is also considered as an effective technology to limit the circulation of black money and combat the black economy.  Technology  The basic process consists of an identifiable banknote, which carries the identification module (Machine Readable Code or microRFID-chip), a blockchain-enabled cloud device, which scans, reads and registers the banknotes as well as a composition of AI-driven automated systems that are based on several sub-systems. The mechanism of the systems is based on a proprietary consortium blockchain that provides a centralized registry of banknotes (CEDIRE hyperledger), a digital dye pack system that deactivates or re-activates illegal and degraded banknotes remotely (RENODE) and in the further course the DICE Automated Security Unit, whose task is to monitor the system‚Äôs functionality.  RFID-Banknotes  In addition to MRC- equipped banknotes, DICE also introduced banknotes that use a specifically designed microchip that was developed for high security application and is perfectly suited for paper currencies, as the chip will not be damaged by any harsh handling in daily use as well as during the Intaglio process. EDAQS claims that the so-called RFIT microchip, which is developed by Australian partner RFIT Limited, is the most secure and robust development in RFID tagging technology to date as well as the smallest On Chip Antenna (OCA) UHF RFID tag in the world. With an overall size of only 0.45mm x 0.45mm x 0.2mm, the patented technology places the antenna directly onto the chip silicon. Every other aspect of the RFIT chip conforms to Electronic Product Code (EPC) Class 1, Gen2 ISO 18000-6C. As both the EPC and Data areas are programmable, the RFIT inlay offers individualized secure electronic tracking. Requiring a specially designed Near Field Antenna (NFA) to activate the passive UHF RFIT tag, the read range is limited up to 3mm, which in itself provides a security feature when compared to standard RFID tags. As an additional level of security, a normal UHF RFID reader is not able to activate and read the tag.  Reception  The DICE banknote system would allow central and national banks to supervise and analyze the entire registered cash circulation. While this is one of the main reasons that have caused the trend for national banks to favor a cashless economy, it is also a serious issue in terms of privacy. EDAQS affirmed that the citizen‚Äôs privacy rights are not being touched with their system and that anonymous circulation data would open a wide range of new development models not only for the governments and national banks, but also for economic analyses and stability research. The public response on the introduction of DICE ranged from a tremendous fear about chip-equipped banknotes to a strong support in improving public safety. The Keesing Journal, an opinion leading publication in the document security industry, called DICE- equipped banknotes as the \\"banknote of the future\\", despite harsh critics from different political parties, including the German and Austrian Pirates Party . In another note, the DICE benefits cover and solve almost all cash-related issues that are seen by governments to be a motivation for the progressive abolition of cash.

Because the women of the Mughal court lived sequestered under purdah, the administration of their living quarters was run entirely by women. The division of the administrative tasks was dictated largely by the vision of Akbar, who organized his zenana of over 5,000 noble women and servants. The women tasked with the protection of the zenana were commonly of Habshi, Tatar, Turk and Kashmiri origin. Kashmiri women were selected because they did not observe purdah. Many of the women were purchased as slaves, and trained for their positions. They are mentioned as early as the reigns of Babur and Humayun, and were proficient in weapons combat, specifically lance, and archery. Mughal emperors spent a great deal of their leisure time in the zenana, and slept there at night, therefore the women assigned to protect the women's quarters were also part of the larger system in place to protect the emperor. The urdubegis of the Mughal court were very skillful warriors. In 1719 Farrukhsiyar hid in his harem, fearing for his life, and the armed guard of the mahal readied themselves for battle.

EPIC was founded by veterans of the Gulf War in 1998 in Washington, DC including executive director Erik Gustafson. History Trade and economic sanctions against Iraq and the Saddam Hussein regime throughout the mid-1990s contributed to conditions of inadequate healthcare, few public education opportunities, and a critical shortage of food across the country. Iraqis who sought to convince Hussein to comply with UN demands or conspire to remove him from power were frequently jailed or killed by the regime. In that context, EPIC was founded in 1998 by veterans of the Gulf War. Early organizers created a grassroots movement to share the concerns of everyday Iraqis living under sanctions with Members of Congress, thought leaders, and the American public. Leading up to the U.S.-led 2003 invasion of Iraq, EPIC urged the American public to support a peaceful approach and to prevent war through the use of e-mail petitions and a speakers bureau of volunteer military veterans who discussed their opposition to the invasion on college campuses and in front of civic organizations. In the aftermath of the invasion, including the years of sectarian violence and occupation of territory by the so-called Islamic State, EPIC's mission shifted to include humanitarian work on-the-ground. Current programs EPIC currently conducts the following programs in three categories, according to its website: = Enhance understanding = * Blog - EPIC's Blog includes written analyses of urgent socio-political issues facing the country, such as anti-corruption reform, infrastructure development, and access to healthcare. * Iraq Matters Podcast - The Iraq Matters podcast involves interviews conducted with notable Iraqis, humanitarian experts, academics, and government officials. Episodes are released at least quarterly and are available on the organization's website. * Iraq Speakers' Bureau - The Speakers' Bureau enables those who have a close connection to Iraq to share their knowledge and experience with the American public, helping to correct misconceptions about Iraq and the needs of refugees fleeing violence. Iraq thought leaders are connected to local speaking engagements wherever they live to help tell Iraq‚Äôs story. = Monitor the crisis = * Iraq Security and Humanitarian Monitor - The weekly e-mail publication and Blog post is available to policymakers, scholars, aid workers, journalists, and anyone interested in analysis of ongoing humanitarian, political, and security developments in Iraq.

The most famous of the Maelii was probably Spurius Maelius, a wealthy merchant who purchased grain from the Etruscans during a famine in 440 BC, and sold it to the poor at a nominal price.

A few days later these claims were revealed to be false when a video of the event was given to the police which showed that the entire encounter was consensual. Ndonye retracted her claims, was suspended from school and required to undergo mental health treatment. The prosecutor described her as \\"a deeply troubled woman\\". No charges were pressed. Allegation and incident Ndonye accused five men of raping her on the morning of September 13, 2009. She stated that they had stolen her cell phone at a college party and then used it to lure her into a bathroom stall where they tied her down and took turns raping her as she screamed. She claimed she tried to call for help not realizing all five men were together. The four of the five men were arrested, held on $350,000 bail, spent three days in jail under protective custody, and all charged with first-degree rape, which carries a possible 25-year sentence. Rondell Bedward was also suspended from Hofstra. Kevin Taveras, one of the men accused, said that Ndonye was accidentally separated from her boyfriend at an on-campus party and began making out with his nephew, Felipe. Taveras told investigators Ndonye invited them to her dorm room. Taveras told her he had friends to which she replied \\"Bring 'em along. It'll be hot\\". Felipe asked her if she was sure, she replied \\"Yeah, sure, I want to\\". A few days later a fifth member of the group who recorded the encounter released the video which showed the encounter to be consensual. The 5 minute video showed Ndonye having sex with two of the men. Ndonye admitted that the sex was consensual and said that she had lied because she did not want her boyfriend to think of her as a \\"slut\\". All charges were subsequently dropped and Bedward was reinstated at Hofstra. Aftermath Ndonye agreed in a private deal with Nassau County District Attorney, Kathleen Rice, to 250 hours of community service and one year of psychiatric counseling instead of facing charges. Emily Bazelon of Slate stated that cases like this invoke \\"raucous commenters [to] say women can't be trusted when they have sex they're not proud of\\" associating the incident with gray rape. The men involved stated, in prison, the false accusation made them \\"fear for their lives\\" and were \\"hounded as the lowest type of criminal\\". Stalin Felipe said the ordeal \\"traumatize[d] us\\" and that his \\"name is forever tarnished\\". Amanda Hess of Washington City Paper stated \\"the meaningless squabbles between the two camps tend to overlook the fact that people concerned about rape and people concerned about fake rape accusations are both fighting against the same thing: rape culture\\". Anna Rittgers of The Washington Times writes that in such cases \\"these young men suffered the threat of expulsion, imprisonment, incurred extensive legal costs, and had their reputations trashed in the media in the process. Worst of all, there are those who will always think those men are rapists, despite all evidence to the contrary\\". In 2012, Ndonye agreed to settle a federal lawsuit filed against her by Rondell Bedward, but declined to discuss the terms of settlement.

The story starts with Hetty arriving at an inn in her late mother's old village a few weeks after the events of Sapphire Battersea.  Plot  The story starts with Hetty Feather searching for her long-lost father in Monksby, her late mother's old village. She finds most residents of the village are cold and unwelcoming, and has very little success identifying her mother by her old name, Ida. She finally locates her father, Bobbie Waters, who is emotional and guilty about having abandoned Hetty's mother and never having known he has a daughter - he welcomes her into his family and reveals to Hetty her mother's real name - Evie. However, he already has a family of his own - his wife Katherine, with whom Hetty shares an instant hatred and rivalry, and their children Mina and Ezra, who are equally reluctant about her. Katherine doubts Hetty's parentage due to the fact that Hetty has only known her mother by a moniker, and cannot confirm whether she's the same person Bobbie abandoned. Hetty establishes an uneasy friendship with her half- siblings, but finds it difficult to fit in the tight-knit, fishing-oriented community of Monksby. At one point, she writes to Sarah Smith, her friend and governor at the Foundling Hospital, to confirm her parentage. Miss Smith soon writes back, confirming her mother's real name and, by extension, her being Bobbie's daughter. Hetty realizes she has more family in Monksby - namely Samuel, her maternal grandfather, whom she resolves to visit. Samuel is aggressive towards Hetty and threatens her off his property. She bitterly realizes she won't fit in Monksby, and soon receives a letter from Jem, telling her the news of her foster father's death. She decides to leave to attend the funeral. Though Hetty feels equally unwelcome among her foster family, she receives a warm welcome from Jem and befriends his childhood friend, Janet. After the funeral, she starts living with Jem and taking care of their disabled mother while Jem works at the farm. Soon after, Gideon, her other foster brother, returns from the Army with a missing eye. Hetty starts to become fed up with doing the same things every day. Jem and Hetty spend Christmas with Janet's family. Hetty soon finds Janet's diary and discovers that Janet is in love with Jem. The circus returns and Hetty reunites with her childhood idol, Madame Adeline, and meets a little girl called Diamond, who is terrified of her abusive master, Beppo.

He represented Belgium at the 2004 Summer Paralympics in Athens where the team ended sixth overall. As well as his Paralympic appearance Genyn was also part of the Belgium team at two IWRF World Championships, at Christchurch in 2006 (finishing 8th) and Vancouver in 2010 (7th). His highlight as a Wheelchair rugby player came in 2009 when he was part of the Belgium team that beat Sweden in the final of the 2009 IWRF European Championship. Genyn followed this with a second Paralympic appearance when Belgium qualified for London 2012 after finishing third in the 2011 European Championship. Genyn's wheelchair rugby career came to an end in November 2013 after he broke his leg. Athletics After the end of his wheelchair rugby career Genyn switched to track and field athletics.

From there, Patriarch Gavrilo traveled to Russia in 1654, taking with him two books for printing: Lives of Serbian Emperors and Patriarchs and Typikon against Latin Heresy of Saint Nil Kabasilas. He was welcomed by Russian Patriarch Nikon and Russian Tsar Michael Romanov. He also participated in the famous Moscow Synod in 1658 which approved Nikon's reforms. Since he decided to stay in Russia, he wrote to Serbian metropolitans to elect a new patriarch. Soon after, he changed his mind and left Russia arriving back to Ottoman Empire in 1659. Upon return, he was accused by the Turks of being responsible for the Russo-Turkish War. he was also accused of attempting to convert some Turks to Christianity.

Since its foundation, the company has operated as a non-profit, donating all its proceeds to Oxfam. The profits donated to Oxfam are then invested in projects throughout the world to reduce poverty. Dr. Jane Cherrington setup Good Books NZ in early 2006. She worked as Chief Executive of the Mental Health Foundation in New Zealand. She currently works in advertising as head of brand strategy for String Theory. The initial offering was an online bookstore, which donated all its profits to charity. Good Books International signed a partnership with Oxfam recently, to donate the company's profits from book sales to joint venture projects with the charitable foundation. The company received critical acclaim in 2012 for their viral online video, promoting the Good Books ethos. It compared how other large online booksellers often made huge profits on book sales while other parts of the world struggled. The advertisement went on to win a gold and bronze award at the London International Awards later that year, as well as many others including the coveted D&AD; Yellow Pencil for Film Advertising Craft. The digital campaign known as \\"Good Books Great Writers Series\\", where each short film attempts to creatively tell the Good Books story in the style of the world's most famous literary talents, and hand-picked directors donate their skill and time, free of charge, to create films for the charity. The series had a follow-up advertisement in late 2012. Named ‚ÄòHavana Heat‚Äô, it was written as a steamy love letter to Good Books, in the bodice-ripping language made famous by Mills & Boon books. In 2014, it was announced that the non-profit had begun to work on a similar project with Oxfam Canada, as well as Oxfam New Zealand. During an interview, it was stated that it had taken over five years for the deal to be reached. The reason for the project's delay was due to the innovative nature of the project. Good Books again received attention in 2015 for the third installment of the Good Books Great Writers Series, We Need to Talk About Alice, an ethereal rendition of Alice in Wonderland, which was a finalist in the 2016 AXIS Awards For Good category. Oxfam partnership Good Books have run a number of schemes with Oxfam to provide charitable donations to fund projects in partnership with Oxfam. Each time a book is purchased from Good Books, a percentage is given to Oxfam to fund these projects. Much of the work carried out by the projects has been based in the Oceanic regions of Asia including, East Timor, Fiji and Papua New Guinea. Their work varies dependent on the region, but includes clean water, sanitation, agriculture development and access to education. As part of the scheme, Good Books International also suggests that customers sign up to Oxfam's donation service.

At the centre stands Mazu surrounded by the four Dragon Gods () and various lesser deities. Distant behind Mazu stands the Sun Goddess (). Chinese traditional religion is polytheistic; many deities are worshipped in a pantheistic view where divinity is inherent in the world. The gods are energies or principles revealing, imitating and propagating the way of Heaven (Tian ), which is the supreme godhead manifesting in the northern culmen of the starry vault of the skies and its order. Many gods are ancestors or men who became deities for their heavenly achievements; most gods are also identified with stars and constellations. Ancestors are regarded as the equivalent of Heaven within human society, and therefore as the means connecting back to Heaven, which is the \\"utmost ancestral father\\" ( zƒìngz«îf√π). Gods are innumerable, as every phenomenon has or is one or more gods, and they are organised in a complex celestial hierarchy. Besides the traditional worship of these entities, Confucianism, Taoism and formal thinkers in general give theological interpretations affirming a monistic essence of divinity. \\"Polytheism\\" and \\"monotheism\\" are categories derived from Western religion and do not fit Chinese religion, which has never conceived the two things as opposites. Since all gods are considered manifestations of q√¨, the \\"power\\" or pneuma of Heaven, some scholars have employed the term \\"polypneumatism\\" or \\"(poly)pneumatolatry\\", first coined by Walter Medhurst (1796‚Äì1857), to describe the practice of Chinese polytheism. In the theology of the classic texts and Confucianism, \\"Heaven is the lord of the hundreds of deities\\". Modern Confucian theology compares them to intelligence, substantial forms or entelechies (inner purposes) as explained by Leibniz, generating all types of beings, so that \\"even mountains and rivers are worshipped as something capable of enjoying sacrificial offerings\\". Unlike in Hinduism, the deification of historical persons and ancestors is not traditionally the duty of Confucians or Taoists. Rather depends on the choices of common people; persons are deified when they have made extraordinary deeds and have left an efficacious legacy. Yet, Confucians and Taoists traditionally may demand that state honour be granted to a particular deity. Each deity has a cult centre and ancestral temple where he or she, or the parents, lived their mortal life. There are frequently disputes over which is the original place and source temple of the cult of a deity. Terminology In Chinese language there is a terminological distinction between sh√©n, d√¨ and xiƒÅn. Although the usage of the former two is sometimes blurred, it corresponds to the distinction in Western cultures between \\"god\\" and \\"deity\\", Latin genius (meaning a generative principle, \\"spirit\\") and deus or 'Deva' ( sanskrit ) and 'divus; d√¨, sometimes translated as \\"thearch\\", implies a manifested or incarnate \\"godly\\" power. It is etymologically and figuratively analogous to the concept of di as the base of a fruit, which falls and produces other fruits. This analogy is attested in the Shuowen Jiezi explaining \\"deity\\" as \\"what faces the base of a melon fruit\\". The latter term xiƒÅn unambiguously means a man who has reached immortality, ( Xian sounds similar to Sanskrit word Chiranjeevi, The Immortal one) similarly to the Western idea of \\"hero\\". God of Heaven Like other symbols such as the swastika, w√†n (\\"myriad things\\") in Chinese, and the Mesopotamian íÄ≠ Dingir/An (\\"Heaven\\"), pp. 97‚Äì98, note 26. and also the Chinese w≈´ (\\"shaman\\"; in Shang script represented by the cross potent ‚ò©), TiƒÅn refers to the northern celestial pole ( Bƒõij√≠), the pivot and the vault of the sky with its spinning constellations. Here is an approximate representation of the TiƒÅnm√©n (\\"Gate of Heaven\\") or TiƒÅnsh≈´ (\\"Pivot of Heaven\\") as the precessional north celestial pole, with Œ± Ursae Minoris as the pole star, with the spinning Chariot constellations in the four phases of time. According to Reza Assasi's theories, the wan may not only be centred in the current precessional pole at Œ± Ursae Minoris, but also very near to the north ecliptic pole if Draco (TiƒÅnl√≥ng ) is conceived as one of its two beams. Chinese traditional theology, which comes in different interpretations according to the classic texts, and specifically Confucian, Taoist and other philosophical formulations, is fundamentally monistic, that is to say it sees the world and the gods who produce it as an organic whole, or cosmos. The universal principle that gives origin to the world is conceived as transcendent and immanent to creation, at the same time. The Chinese idea of the universal God is expressed in different ways; there are many names of God from the different sources of Chinese tradition. The radical Chinese terms for the universal God are TiƒÅn and Sh√†ngd√¨ (the \\"Highest Deity\\") or simply D√¨ (\\"Deity\\"). There is also the concept of T√†id√¨ (the \\"Great Deity\\"). D√¨ is a title expressing dominance over the all-under-Heaven, that is all things generated by Heaven and ordered by its cycles and by the stars. TiƒÅn is usually translated as \\"Heaven\\", but by graphical etymology it means \\"Great One\\" and a number of scholars relate it to the same D√¨ through phonetic etymology and trace their common root, through their archaic forms respectively *Tee≈ã and *Tees, to the symbols of the squared north celestial pole godhead (Dƒ´ng ). These names are combined in different ways in Chinese theological literature, often interchanged in the same paragraph if not in the same sentence. =Names of the God of Heaven= Obatala is known by many names. Besides Shangdi and Taidi, other names include Yudi (\\"Jade Deity\\") can change into Obatala, and Taiyi (\\"Great Oneness\\") who, in mythical imagery, holds the ladle of the Big Dipper (Great Chariot) providing the movement of life to the world. As the hub of the skies, the north celestial pole constellations are known, among various names, as TiƒÅnm√©n (\\"Gate of Heaven\\") p. 190. and TiƒÅnsh≈´ (\\"Pivot of Heaven\\"). p. 343, note 17. Other names of the God of Heaven are attested in the vast Chinese religio-philosophical literary tradition: * TiƒÅnd√¨ ‚Äîthe \\"Deity of Heaven\\" or \\"Emperor of Heaven\\": \\"On Rectification\\" (Zheng lun) of the Xunzi uses this term to refer to the active God of Heaven setting in motion creation; * TiƒÅnzh«î ‚Äîthe \\"Lord of Heaven\\": In \\"The Document of Offering Sacrifices to Heaven and Earth on the Mountain Tai\\" (Fengshan shu) of the Records of the Grand Historian it is used as the title of the first God from whom all the other gods derive. * TiƒÅnhu√°ng ‚Äîthe \\"King of Heaven\\": In the \\"Poem of Fathoming Profundity\\" (Si'xuan fu), transcribed in \\"The History of the Later Han Dynasty\\" (Hou Han shu), Zhang Heng ornately writes: ¬´I ask the superintendent of the Heavenly Gate to open the door and let me visit the King of Heaven at the Jade Palace¬ª; * TiƒÅng≈çng ‚Äîthe \\"Duke of Heaven\\" or \\"General of Heaven\\"; * TiƒÅnj≈´n ‚Äîthe \\"Prince of Heaven\\" or \\"Lord of Heaven\\"; * TiƒÅnz≈´n ‚Äîthe \\"Heavenly Venerable\\", also a title for high gods in Taoist theologies; * TiƒÅnsh√©n ‚Äîthe \\"God of Heaven\\", interpreted in the Shuowen Jiezi as \\"the being that gives birth to all things\\"; * Sh√©nhu√°ng ‚Äî\\"God the King\\", attested in Taihong (\\"The Origin of Vital Breath\\"); * L«éotiƒÅny√© ()‚Äîthe \\"Olden Heavenly Father\\". Tian is both transcendent and immanent, manifesting in the three forms of dominance, destiny and nature of things. In the Wujing yiyi (, \\"Different Meanings in the Five Classics\\"), Xu Shen explains that the designation of Heaven is quintuple: * Hu√°ng TiƒÅn ‚Äî\\"Yellow Heaven\\" or \\"Shining Heaven\\", when it is venerated as the lord of creation; * H√†o TiƒÅn ‚Äî\\"Vast Heaven\\", with regard to the vastness of its vital breath (qi); * M√≠n TiƒÅn ‚Äî\\"Compassionate Heaven\\", for it hears and corresponds with justice to the all- under-Heaven; * Sh√†ng TiƒÅn ‚Äî\\"Highest Heaven\\" or \\"First Heaven\\", for it is the primordial being supervising all-under-Heaven; * CƒÅng TiƒÅn ‚Äî\\"Deep-Green Heaven\\", for it being unfathomably deep. All these designations reflect a hierarchical, multiperspective experience of divinity. Lists of gods, deities and immortals Main altar and statue of Doumu inside the Temple of Doumu in Butterworth, Penang, Malaysia. A temple dedicated to Pangu in Zhunan, Miaoli. Many classical books have lists and hierarchies of gods and immortals, among which the \\"Completed Record of Deities and Immortals\\" (, Sh√©nxiƒÅn T≈çngji√†n) of the Ming dynasty, and the Biographies of the Deities and Immortals or Shenxian Zhuan by Ge Hong (284-343). There's also the older Collected Biographies of the Immortals or Liexian Zhuan. Couplets or polarities, such as Fuxi and Nuwa, Xiwangmu and Dongwanggong, and the highest couple of Heaven and Earth, all embody yin and yang and are at once the originators and maintainers of the ordering process of space and time.

The British Museum =Cosmic gods= * Yudi ( \\"Jade Deity\\") or Yuhuang ( \\"Jade Emperor\\" or \\"Jade King\\"), is the popular human-like representation of the God of Heaven. Jade traditionally represents purity, so it is a metaphor for the unfathomable source of creation. * Doumu ( \\"Mother of the Great Chariot\\"), often entitled with the honorific Tianhou ( \\"Queen of Heaven\\") is the heavenly goddess portrayed as the mother of the Big Dipper (Great Chariot), whose seven stars in addition to two invisible ones are conceived as her sons, the Jiuhuangshen ( \\"Nine God-Kings\\"), themselves regarded as the ninefold manifestation of Jiuhuangdadi (, \\"Great Deity of the Nine Kings\\") or Doufu \\"Father of the Great Chariot\\"), another name of the God of Heaven. She is therefore both wife and mother of the God of Heaven. p. 19. * Pangu (), a macranthropic metaphor of the cosmos. He separated yin and yang, creating the earth (murky yin) and the sky (clear yang). All things were made from his body after he died. * Xiwangmu ( \\"Queen Mother of the West\\"), identified with the Kunlun Mountain, shamanic inspiration, death and immortality. She is the dark, chthonic goddess, pure yin, at the same time terrifying and benign, both creation and destruction, associated with the tiger and weaving. Her male counterpart is Dongwanggong ( \\"King Duke of the East\\"; also called Mugong, Êú®ÂÖ¨ \\"Duke of the Woods\\"), who represents the yang principle. ** Yi the Archer (H√≤uy√¨ ) was a man who sought for immortality reaching Xiwangmu on her mountain Kunlun. * Yanwang ( \\"Purgatory King\\") the ruler of the underworld, assisted by the Heibai Wuchang ( \\"Black and White Impermanence\\") representing the alternation of yin and yang principles, alongside Ox-Head and Horse-Face, who escort spirits to his realm. * Yinyanggong ( \\"Yinyang Duke\\") or Yinyangsi ( \\"Yinyang Controller\\"), the personification of the union of yin and yang.

He is often represented as a human with horns and other features of an ox. * W«îd√¨ ‚Äî Five Deities, also W«îfƒÅng Sh√†ngd√¨ ( \\"Five Manifestations of the Highest Deity\\"), W«îfƒÅng TiƒÅnsh√©n ( \\"Five Manifestations of the Heavenly God\\"), W«îfƒÅngd√¨ ( \\"Five Forms Deity\\"), W«îtiƒÅnd√¨ ( \\"Five Heavenly Deities\\"), W«îl«éoj≈´n ( \\"Five Ancient Lords\\"), W«îd√†osh√©n ( \\"Five Ways God(s)\\"); they are the five main \\"horizontal\\" manifestations of Heaven and according with the Three Potencies they have a celestial, a terrestrial and a chthonic form. They correspond to the five phases of creation, the five constellations rotating around the celestial pole and five planets, the five sacred mountains and five directions of space (their terrestrial form), and the five Dragon Gods which represent their mounts, that is to say the material forces they preside over (their chthonic form). ** Hu√°ngd√¨ ‚Äî Yellow Emperor or Yellow Deity; or Hu√°ngsh√©n ‚Äî Yellow God, also known as XuƒÅnyu√°n Hu√°ngd√¨ ( \\"Yellow Deity of the Chariot Shaft\\"), is the Zh≈çngyu√®d√†d√¨ ( \\"Great Deity of the Central Peak\\"): he represents the essence of earth and the Yellow Dragon, and is associated with Saturn. The character hu√°ng, for \\"yellow\\", also means, by homophony and shared etymology with hu√°ng, \\"august\\", \\"creator\\" and \\"radiant\\", identifying the Yellow Emperor with Shangdi (the \\"Highest Deity\\"). Huangdi represents the heart of creation, the axis mundi (Kunlun) that is the manifestation of the divine order in physical reality, opening the way to immortality. As the deity of the centre, intersecting the Three Patrons and the Five Deities, in the Shizi he is described as \\"Yellow Emperor with Four Faces\\" ( Hu√°ngd√¨ S√¨mi√†n). As a human, he is said to have been the fruit of a virginal birth, as his mother Fubao conceived him as she was aroused, while walking in the country, by a lightning from the Big Dipper (Great Chariot). She delivered her son after twenty-four months on the mount of Shou (Longevity) or mount Xuanyuan (Chariot Shaft), after which he was named. p. 246. He is reputed to be the founder of the Huaxia civilisation, and the Han Chinese identify themselves as the descendants of Yandi and Huangdi. ** CƒÅngd√¨ ‚Äî Green Deity; or Qƒ´ngd√¨ ‚Äî Blue Deity or Bluegreen Deity, the D≈çngd√¨ ( \\"East Deity\\") or D≈çngyu√®d√†d√¨ ( \\"Great Deity of the Eastern Peak\\"): he is T√†ih√†o , associated with the essence of wood and with Jupiter, and is the god of fertility and spring. The Bluegreen Dragon is both his animal form and constellation. His female consort is the goddess of fertility Bixia. ** Hƒìid√¨ ‚Äî Black Deity, the Bƒõid√¨ ( \\"North Deity\\") or Bƒõiyu√®d√†d√¨ ( \\"Great Deity of the Northern Peak\\"): he is ZhuƒÅnx≈´ (), today frequently worshipped as Xu√°nw«î ( \\"Dark Warrior\\") or Zhƒìnw«î (), and is associated with the essence of water and winter, and with Mercury. His animal form is the Black Dragon and his stellar animal is the tortoise-snake. ** Ch√¨d√¨ ‚Äî Red Deity, the N√°nd√¨ ( \\"South Deity\\") or N√°nyu√®d√†d√¨ ( \\"Great Deity of the Southern Peak\\"): he is Shennong (the \\"Divine Farmer\\"), the Yandi (\\"Fiery Deity\\"), associated with the essence of fire and summer, and with Mars. His animal form is the Red Dragon and his stellar animal is the phoenix. He is the god of agriculture, animal husbandry, medicinal plants and market. ** B√°id√¨ ‚Äî White Deity, the Xƒ´d√¨ ( \\"West Deity\\") or Xƒ´yu√®d√†d√¨ ( \\"Great Deity of the Western Peak\\"): he is Sh«éoh√†o (), and is the god of the essence of metal and autumn, associated with Venus. His animal form is the White Dragon and his stellar animal the tiger. * SƒÅnguƒÅn or SƒÅnguƒÅnd√†d√¨ ‚Äî Three Officials [of Heaven] or Three Officer Great Deities: Yao the Official of Heaven (TiƒÅnguƒÅn ), Shun the Official of Earth (DeguƒÅn ), and Yu the Official of Water (Shu«êguƒÅn ). In mythology, Huangdi and Yandi fought a battle against each other; and Huang finally defeated Yan with the help of the Dragon (the controller of water, who is Huangdi himself). pp. 156-157 This myth symbolises the equipoise of yin and yang, here the fire of knowledge (reason and craft) and earthly stability. Yan is flame, scorching fire, or an excess of it (it is important to note that graphically it is a double huo, \\"fire\\"). As an excess of fire brings destruction to the earth, it has to be controlled by a ruling principle. Nothing is good in itself, without limits; good outcomes depend on the proportion in the composition of things and their interactions, never on extremes in absolute terms. Huangdi and Yandi are complementary opposites, necessary for the existence of one another, and they are powers that exist together within the human being. =Gods of celestial and terrestrial phenomena= Temple of the Wind God in Tainan. * L√≥ngsh√©n ‚Äî Dragon Gods, or L√≥ngw√°ng ‚Äî Dragon Kings: also S√¨h«éi L√≥ngw√°ng ( \\"Dragon Kings of the Four Seas\\"), are gods of watery sources, usually reduced to four, patrons of the Four Seas (sihai ) and the four cardinal directions.

The worship of mother goddesses for the cultivation of offspring is present all over China, but predominantly in northern provinces. There are nine main goddesses, and all of them tend to be considered as manifestations or attendant forces of a singular goddess identified variously as the Lady of the Blue Dawn (B√¨xi√° Yu√°nj≈´n , also known as the TiƒÅnxiƒÅn Ni√°ngni√°ng , \\"Heavenly Immortal Lady\\", or T√†ishƒÅn Ni√°ngni√°ng , \\"Lady of Mount Tai\\", or also Ji«îtiƒÅn Sh√®ngm«î , \\"Holy Mother of the Nine Skies\\") or Houtu, the goddess of the earth. Bixia herself is identified by Taoists as the more ancient goddess Xiwangmu, The general Chinese term for \\"goddess\\" is n«ösh√©n, and goddesses may receive many qualifying titles including m«î ( \\"mother\\"), l«éom«î ( \\"old mother\\"), sh√®ngm«î ( \\"holy mother\\"), ni√°ngni√°ng ( \\"lady\\"), n«éinai ( \\"granny\\"). The additional eight main goddesses of fertility, reproduction and growth are: * BƒÅnzhƒõn Ni√°ngni√°ng, the goddess who protects children from illness; * Cuƒ´shƒìng Ni√°ngni√°ng, the goddess who gives swift childbirth and protects midwives; * N«éim«î Ni√°ngni√°ng, the goddess who presides over maternal milk and protects nursing; * P√©ig≈´ Ni√°ngni√°ng, the goddess who cultivate children; * P√©iy«éng Ni√°ngni√°ng, the goddess who protects the upbringing of children; * S√≤ngzi Ni√°ngni√°ng or Z«ês≈´n Ni√°ngni√°ng, the goddess who presides over offspring; * Y«énguƒÅng Ni√°ngni√°ng, the goddess who protects eyesight; * Y«ênm√©ng Ni√°ngni√°ng, the goddess who guides young children. Altars of goddess worship are usually arranged with Bixia at the center and two goddesses at her sides, most frequently the Lady of Eyesight and the Lady of Offspring. A different figure but with the same astral connections as Bixia is the Goddess of the Seven Stars ( Qƒ´xƒ´ng Ni√°ngni√°ng). There is also the cluster of the Holy Mothers of the Three Skies ( SƒÅnxiƒÅo Sh√®ngm«î; or SƒÅnxiƒÅo Ni√°ngni√°ng, \\"Ladies of the Three Stars\\"), composed of Yunxiao Guniang, Qiongxiao Guniang and Bixiao Guniang. The cult of Chenjinggu present in southeast China is identified by some scholars as an emanation of the northern cult of Bixia. pp. 349-350. Other goddesses worshipped in China include C√°nm«î ( Silkworm Mother) or C√°ng≈´ ( Silkworm Maiden), identified with L√©iz«î (, the wife of the Yellow Emperor), M√°g≈´ ( \\"Hemp Maiden\\"), S«éoqƒ´ng Ni√°ngni√°ng ( Goddess who Sweeps Clean), SƒÅnzh≈çu Ni√°ngni√°ng ( Goddess of the Three Isles), and Wusheng Laomu. Mother goddess is central in the theology of many folk religious sects. =Gods of northeast China= Northeast China has clusters of deities which are peculiar to the area, deriving from the Manchu and broader Tungusic substratum of the local population. Animal deities related to shamanic practices are characteristic of the area and reflect wider Chinese cosmology. Besides the aforementioned Fox Gods ( H√∫xiƒÅn), they include: * Hu√°ngxiƒÅn ‚Äî Yellow Immortal, the Weasel God * Sh√©xiƒÅn ‚Äî Snake Immortal, also variously called Li«îxiƒÅn ‚Äî Immortal Liu, or Ch√°ngxiƒÅn ‚Äî Viper Immortal, or also M«éngxiƒÅn ‚Äî Python or Boa Immortal * B√°ixiƒÅn ‚Äî White Immortal, the Hedgehog God * HƒìixiƒÅn ‚Äî Black Immortal, who may be the W≈´yƒÅxiƒÅn ‚Äî Crow Immortal, or the Huƒ´xiƒÅn ‚Äî Rat Immortal, with the latter considered a misinterpretation of the former =Gods of Indian origin= Temple of the Four-Faced God in Changhua, Taiwan. Gods who have been adopted into Chinese religion but who have their origins in the Indian subcontinent or Hinduism: * GuƒÅnyƒ´n ‚Äî \\"She who Hears the Cries of the World\\", a Chinese goddess of mercy modeled after the bodhisattva Avalokite≈õvara * S√¨mi√†nsh√©n ‚Äî \\"Four-Faced God\\", but also a metaphor for \\"Ubiquitous God\\": The recent cult has its origin in the Thai transmission of the Hindu god Brahma, but it is important to note that it is also an epithet of the indigenous Chinese god Huangdi who, as the deity of the centre of the cosmos, is described in the Shizi as \\"Yellow Emperor with Four Faces\\" ( Hu√°ngd√¨ S√¨mi√†n). * Xi√†ngt√≥ush√©n ‚Äî \\"Elephant-Head God\\", is the Indian god Ganesha p. 311. =Gods of northern people= * G√©s√†ƒõr or G√©sƒ´ƒõr (+ w√°ng or + sh√©n) ‚Äî \\"King Gesar\\" or \\"God Gesar\\", an interethnic culture hero of a namesake epic poem, worshipped by Tibetans, Mongols, Han Chinese and other ethnic groups. He derives from Divus Caesar of ancient Rome through a cultural transmission from the peoples of Central Asia. * Genghis Khan ( Ch√©ngj√≠sƒ´h√°n), worshipped by Mongols and Chinese under a variety of divinity titles including Sh√®ngw«î Hu√°ngd√¨ ‚Äî \\"Holy Military Sovereign Deity\\", F«étiƒÅn Q«êy√πn \\"Starter of the Transmission of the Law of Heaven\\", and T√†iz«î ‚Äî \\"Great Ancestor\\" (of the Yuan and the Mongols).

Mac n' Cheetos were first introduced in late June 2016 and sold at Burger King in limited supplies. The original product contained five pieces and was initially served with a side of ranch dressing. Today, Mac n' Cheetos are available frozen at grocery stores around the United States. Many publications have pointed out that Mac n' Cheetos is part of a larger trend of blending fast foods with well-known snack foods, as well as reflecting the current state of fast food alliances.  Product description  Mac n' Cheetos are fried macaroni and cheese bites shaped and coated to resemble Cheetos brand cheese curls. The fried shell of a curl is crunchy, and is flavored and colored like Cheetos. Burger King president Alex Macedo described the food item as a \\"triple threat\\", because it combines Burger King, Cheetos, and macaroni and cheese. Mac n' Cheetos is a portmanteau of mac n' cheese and Cheetos. Currently, there are two known varieties of Mac n' Cheetos: \\"Creamy Cheddar\\", and \\"Flamin' Hot\\".  History  Fried macaroni and cheese had existed prior to the introduction of Mac n' Cheetos. The Cheesecake Factory and Wayback Burgers have sold similar products in the past. Other fast food restaurants like Taco Bell have previously employed a similar strategy. In 2012, Taco Bell, which is owned by Yum! Brands, introduced the Doritos Locos Taco, whose taco shell is composed of the Doritos chip. Offshoots followed as Cool Ranch, Nacho Cheese and Fiery Doritos. Consumerists Laura Northrup compared them to 7-Eleven's Doritos Loaded and Hostess Brands's deep-fried Twinkies sold at participating Walmart locations. In 2015, Burger King entered into a partnership with PepsiCo's Frito-Lay, which also owns the Doritos and Ruffles brands. Mac n' Cheetos marked the first time the Cheetos brand extended beyond chips into hybrid foods. On June 22, 2016, Burger King announced that they would begin selling the product the next week. The product was initially test-marketed at Burger King restaurants during a product trial in Southern California. Mac n' Cheetos were introduced nationwide on June 27, 2016. In an interview, Burger King president Alex Macedo said, \\"We‚Äôre partnering up with one of Americans‚Äô favorite brands. It's quite unique.\\" Later, Burger King offered Cheeto Chicken Fries, based on their BK Chicken Fries. Mac n' Cheetos, including other Burger King products like the recently introduced Oscar Mayer hot dogs, reflects the fast-food alliances restaurants have with other companies. While PepsiCo owns Frito-Lay's Cheetos, the American restaurants sell Coca-Cola beverages. Despite this recent product, Macedo remarked, \\"It‚Äôs not a plan for us to migrate to Pepsi. Our relationship with Coke is as good as it is with PepsiCo.\\" However, Macedo has also said, \\"We‚Äôre working on a few other menu items. There‚Äôs room for us to do more together in the future.\\" Mac n' Cheetos have also been sold at U.S. convenience store/gas station Sheetz stores in North Carolina and Ohio. On May 18, 2017, Burger King returned the Mac n' Cheetos to its menu for a limited time. Frito-Lay also introduced a \\"Flamin' Hot Mac n' Cheetos\\" based on a spicier variant of Cheetos. In response to fan interest following the popularity of the Burger King limited time releases, Frito-Lay released frozen Mac n' Cheetos in grocery stores.  Reception  Fox News described them as \\"bright orange\\" with a \\"pretty unusual\\" shape. The Chicago Tribunes Joseph Hernandez called the color of the menu item \\"neon-orange\\". Consequence of Sounds Ben Kaye remarked that they were \\"new cat poop-shaped fried mac and Cheeto cheese curls\\". Consumerists Ashlee Kieler perceived its color as \\"glowing, orange-ish\\". The Verges Dami Lee commented that they were \\"coagulated orange clumps of processed cheese\\". Bloomberg Newss Leslie Patton said it was \\"portable macaroni-and-cheese bites are similar to mozzarella sticks\\". Food & Wines Mike Pomranz said \\"Like a car crash, this bizarre mashup is just too intense to ignore.\\" The Raw Storys Brad Reed saw it as \\"radioactive-orange\\" and \\"Trump-colored\\", but remarked \\"do look marginally more appetizing than the terrifying bright-red Whopper Burger King released earlier this year\\". Vices Alex Swerdloff noted the product as \\"a chode-like mass\\" and resembling \\"the lovechild of E.T.‚Äôs finger and a bloated corpse that was given a spray tan\\". Yahoo! Styles Claire Lower called them \\"orange nuggets\\". The Denver Posts Megan McArdle reported it \\"bearing the same resemblance to real food as a plastic Lego tree does to a stately elm\\". The Guardians Joshua David Stein said the Cheetos crust was \\"bright orange\\". The Capital Timess Rob Thomas said they were \\"five stubby cylinders that look like mozzarella sticks, dusted heavily with orange Cheeto dust\\". Business Insider performed a blind taste test for Mac n' Cheetos. About half of the testers were repulsed by the product. Fox News Channel's Chew On This enacted a blind taste test for Mac n' Cheetos in the streets of New York City. Reception proved positive. In the web series Juggalos Review Foods, two Insane Clown Posse fans (or Juggalos) tried the Mac n' Cheetos with a more mixed reception. One of the hosts appraised the food product with \\"this tastes like processed weird gross mac and cheese-like gimmicky piece of crap food item from Burger King\\". USA Todays Ted Berg said \\"they‚Äôre not good\\" but also \\"not totally awful\\" either. Kotakus Mike Fahey said \\"pleased to report that Mac n‚Äô Cheetos taste much better than they look\\" but also that they do not taste like the cheese puff but rather like the Kellogg's cracker Cheez-It. Chicago Tribunes Joseph Hernandez described the meal as \\"gritty, fried nugget of Easy Mac, rolled in the remains of the bottom of a bag of Cheetos\\". Yahoo! Styles Claire Lower said \\"I liked them but, maybe this is because my standards for stunt food are much too high, I didn't love them.\\" The Capital Timess Rob Thomas reviewed the interior of the Mac n' Cheetos favorably stating \\"does indeed have the satisfying cheesy blandness of a container of quick-zapped microwave Easy Mac, salty and starchy\\". However, Thomas was critical of how it did not taste like Cheetos saying \\"[i]t‚Äôs very disappointing\\". When the menu item was brought back in October 2016 by Sheetz, Consumerists Laura Northrup described them as \\"orange breaded carbohydrate globs.\\" Fortunes Michal Addady called it \\"essentially fried mac and cheese coated with flavoring from Cheetos, a PepsiCo brand.\\" Bustles Claire Warner described Mac n' Cheetos returning via Sheetz as \\"the Internet basically threw a party.\\" When the food item returned to the Burger King menu on May 18, 2017, Eater.coms Amanda Kludt described it as \\"novelty dish and millennial-bait.\\" Brit + Cos Maggie McCracken ranked Mac n' Cheetos #1 on the list \\"10 Most Popular Mac and Cheese #Cheatday Meals on Instagram\\" with \\"a WHOPping (get it?)\\" 35,000 likes on Instagram. Bustles Claire Warner said \\"it sounds like what happens when you accidentally drop a glob of macaroni and cheese into a half-consumed bag of Cheetos resting on your lap, and a few hours later, you decide to eat said glob because it's 2 a.m. and nobody's watching. You already know if this is something you're into.\\"  Price  Mac n' Cheetos contains five pieces and was originally priced in Burger King at about $2.50 In New York City, the total cost including New York state sales tax is $3.26. USA Todays Ted Berg was critical of the price choice, as he thought it would be 99¬¢ at Taco Bell. When the food item was brought back in October 2016 at Sheetz, it was priced at $2.99. Sheetz offers it available for pickup via the Sheetz Apps menu. However, it costs $3.49 in Altoona, Pennsylvania. In May 2017, the Mac n' Cheetos was priced $2.69 at Burger King.  Advertising  Burger King called its product a \\"dangerously cheesy re-imagination\\".

The artwork was designed by Eric Larsen and painted in 1990 by North Pacific Sign and Design, but was destroyed during the building's 2008 renovation to become the new headquarters for Mercy Corps.The Oregonian: The mural received a generally positive reception, though in 1997 the president of the company that owned the building expressed his desire to replace the artwork, which he considered a free advertisement for the Oregon Zoo. He wanted to replace it with an illustration that promoted the Old Town Chinatown neighborhood. His search was met with resistance by building tenants, particularly employees of the advertising agency Young and Roehr, who began displaying \\"Save Packy\\" signs and campaigning for the art's preservation. Description and history The mural was designed by commercial artist Eric Larsen, who created the piece after winning a competition. It was painted on the north wall of the Skidmore Fountain Building (also known as the Reed Building and Packer-Scott Building)National Historic Landmark Nomination: in 1990 by North Pacific Sign and Design. The artwork depicted Packy (born at the Oregon Zoo on April 14, 1962), an Asian elephant who was the first elephant born in the Western Hemisphere in 44 years. Co-sponsors of the artwork included Gango Gallery, the Oregon Zoo, and Security Pacific Bank. In 1997, Mike Hashem, who served as president of Skidmore Management Corporation‚Äîthe owner of the Skidmore Fountain Building‚Äîexpressed his desire to replace the mural. He said the artwork served as a free advertisement for the Oregon Zoo, and should be replaced with something that promoted the Old Town Chinatown neighborhood. The Historic Preservation League of Oregon (now Restore Oregon) and the State Historic Preservation Office of the Oregon Parks and Recreation Department raised no concerns about the mural's removal, since the artwork was not designated as an official city landmark or recognized as having historic significance. The league's development coordinator said, \\"We can't say that you can't do anything to a sign. Traditionally, people kept advertising new products. Who is to say the way it is today is the way it should be frozen?\\" A planner with the Portland Bureau of Planning, however, said that local sign regulations prevented the mural, which the agency considered a \\"painted wall decoration\\", from being replaced by a private advertisement of the same size, but that it could be replaced with another mural. Building tenants, particularly those who worked for the advertising agency Young and Roehr, began displaying \\"Save Packy\\" signs and campaigning for the mural's preservation. Young and Roehr reportedly offered to fund the artwork's refurbishment. Hashem said he also received offers from other potential advertisers, and claimed the space was worth $2,000 per month. Hashem estimated that repainting the mural would cost $5,000‚Äì8,000. One owner of North Pacific Sign and Design, who had painted the mural with his father, brother, and two assistants, said the work could be cleaned and \\"touched up\\" for significantly less. Larsen was flattered by peoples' positive reaction to the artwork, but was indifferent about the mural's future. He told The Oregonian, \\"People usually look at my work for about five seconds. I'm not emotionally attached to any of it.\\" In April 2002, citywide celebrations for Packy's fortieth birthday raised money to restore the faded mural. In addition, the mural has been used as an example of a decorative outdoor wall painting in articles about the city's sign regulations. =Destruction= The renovated headquarters for Mercy Corps in 2011 In 2008, the mural was destroyed during the building's renovation to become the new headquarters for Mercy Corps.The Oregonian: The top part of the artwork was painted on the building's uppermost floor, which had a stucco exterior and was removed to restore the building to its historic state. Windows were also installed along the wall on which the mural was painted. Mercy Corps planned to \\"pay tribute to the mural\\" in the updated building's ground floor. A spokesperson for the organization confirmed that they consulted with the mural's artist and the Oregon Zoo, the neighborhood association, and the Regional Arts & Culture Council. She said: > We understand that it is an important part of the neighborhood's history. > ... We're renovating the Skidmore Fountain Building to its historic > condition. That means that the mural begins to come down. And then > additionally, we have to restore the condition of the brick, which is > crumbling and disintegrating and eventually would become unstable. ... > Historically, a lot of it had been warehouse space and didn't need windows, > but we're going to utilize all the square footage for our offices. ... We > have documents of the mural in its condition since we've taken ownership of > the building and we've talked to the zoo, which has some of the original > photographs. Reception The Oregonian Sura Rubinstein said of the mural's public reception: \\"Some see a charming tribute to an elephant who's captivated the heart of the city since 1962. ... Some see a painting that's become an integral part of the city's landscape. ... \\" In 1997, when the mural's fate was uncertain, the Oregon Zoo's marketing manager said, \\"It was hoped the mural itself would become something of a landmark. A lot of people love it.\\" See also * 1990 in art * Art destruction * Cultural depictions of elephants * Da Tung and Xi'an Bao Bao (2002), bronze sculpture in Portland's North Park Blocks * List of public art in Portland, Oregon References External links * 1990 establishments in Oregon 1990s murals 2008 disestablishments in Oregon Elephants in art Lost paintings Murals in Oregon Old Town Chinatown Southwest Portland, Oregon ","title":"Packy mural"},{"id":"51132434","text":"The CWI/WIPA Awards are a set of annual cricket awards given jointly by the Cricket West Indies (CWI) and the West Indies Players' Association (WIPA). The awards recognise and honour the best West Indian international and domestic cricketers of the past season. The awards were known as WIPA Awards until 2013 when the CWI, then known as West Indies Cricket Board (WICB), and WIPA decided to jointly host the awards function. History The West Indies Players' Association (WIPA) started the WIPA Awards in 2004, with First Citizens Bank as its title sponsor. The awards were called \\"First Citizens WIPA Awards\\" for the first nine years, after which WIPA and the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) agreed to jointly organize and fund the awards with the function being renamed as \\"WICB/WIPA Awards\\". After West Indies Cricket Board was renamed as Cricket West Indies, the awards have come to be known as \\"CWI/WIPA Awards\\". The winners of the awards are selected by a panel of judges which mainly consists of eminent former cricketers from the West Indies. The panel of judges for the inaugural awards in 2004 included Ian Bishop, Joey Carew, Tony Cozier, Gordon Greenidge, Gus Logie, Vivian Richards and Ricky Skerritt. Brian Lara won the first ever WIPA Player of the Year Award in 2004 and went on to win it the following two years as well to complete a hat-trick. Apart from Lara, three cricketers have won the award more than once: Shivnarine Chanderpaul (2008 and 2009), Chris Gayle (2007 and 2011) and Marlon Samuels (2013 and 2016). Chanderpaul has won the Test Player of the Year award four times (2008, 2009, 2013 and 2014), the most by any player, while the ODI Player of the Year has been won twice each by Chanderpaul, Gayle and Samuels. The T20I Player of the Year award was introduced in 2010 and only Sunil Narine has won it more than once (in 2013 and 2014). The only award in women's cricket, Women's Player of the Year, has been won by Stafanie Taylor for a record nine times, including eight wins in succession from 2009 to 2016.

The work was co-commissioned by The Proms and the Philadelphia Orchestra and was completed in 1998. Its world premiere was performed by the Hilliard Ensemble, the BBC Symphony Orchestra & Chorus, and the Westminster Cathedral Boys' Choir under the direction of Andrew Davis at Royal Albert Hall, London, on 5 September 1999. The journalist Damian Thompson of The Spectator described it as \\"one of MacMillan's masterpieces.\\" Composition =Background= Quickening is set to text by the British poet and frequent MacMillan collaborator Michael Symmons Roberts. It is written in Aramaic and English, but also features the use of glossolalia (speaking in tongues). The religious theme of the work draws upon the phenomenon of childbirth, with a boys' choir particularly used to evoke the journey of an unborn child. =Structure= The piece has a duration of roughly 48 minutes and is composed in four movements: #Incarnadine #Midwife #Poppies #Living Water =Instrumentation= The work is scored for a countertenor, two tenors, baritone, children's choir, SATB chorus, and a large orchestra consisting of two flutes, piccolo, three oboes (3rd doubling cor anglais), three clarinets (3rd doubling bass clarinet), two bassoons, contrabassoon, four horns, four trumpets, three trombones, tuba, timpani, four percussionists, harp, piano (doubling celesta), chamber organ, grand organ (or synthesizer), and strings. Reception Quickening has been highly praised by many music critics. Reviewing the United States premiere in Philadelphia, Peter Dobrin of The Philadelphia Inquirer wrote, \\"The best thing about Quickening - one of the orchestra's centennial commissions - is that it is very much of our time. MacMillan's musical language is all his own, and the emotional message behind it speaks for this era in a way that very few works do. It's chaotic, vaguely spiritual, obstreperous, and full of simultaneously conflicting messages about what we should be feeling.\\" Despite noting that \\"a lot of the concrete associations [MacMillan] tries to get across in the piece didn't ring true\\" with him, Dobrin concluded, \\"But music doesn't need, or even always benefit from, a tangible relationship with real life. The pure sonic experience is more than enough reason to justify the investment of mental adrenaline needed to listen.\\" John von Rhein of the Chicago Tribune later described the piece as an \\"arresting meditation\\" and wrote, \\"None of MacMillan's effects come across as meretricious, certainly not the murmurous Babel of mixed choral voices at the beginning or the magical hush of 'unborn' children's voices with solo violin at the end. Those two sections, 'Incarnadine' and 'Living Waters,' frame two darker central tableaux, 'Midwife' and 'Poppies,' that erupt in spasms of orchestral agitation undergirding powerful surges of choral declamation.\\" Lawrence A. Johnson of the Chicago Classical Review similarly remarked, \\"Quickening is a big, complex and multifaceted work with a lot to take in at first hearing. MacMillan's distinctive brand of musical 'muscular Christianity' is here at his most flamboyant and audacious, with largely successful results. The composer wields his vast forces with skill and panache, particularly in his writing for brass and his favored percussion, often making a dazzling and brilliant effect.\\" Andrew Achenbach of Gramophone called it, \\"A powerful experience, in sum, and a work well worth getting to know.\\" Putting a contrary view (reviewing the work's premi√®re) was John Allison in The TimesSeptember 7 1999, p.44, who found the work \\"...\\"big\\" only in terms of its duration and the vast forces it employs: the absence of developed, large-scale ideas in MacMillan's music is becoming a worrying trend...\\". Allison went on to say that \\"the score is no greater than the sum of its parts: acclaim has come easily to MacMillan, but now it is surely time for less self-indulgence\\". Recording A recording of Quickening was released through Chandos Records on 27 January 2009. The recording was performed by the Hilliard Ensemble, the CBSO Chorus & youth chorus, and the BBC Philharmonic under the direction of MacMillan.

Gameplay Pac-Man being pursued by ghosts while eating Pac-Dots. Pac-Man Championship Edition 2 builds upon the gameplay introduced in Championship Edition and Championship Edition DX, which add faster gameplay to the traditional Pac-Man formula. Taking control of Pac-Man, players go through various mazes collecting pellets while avoiding roaming ghosts. Gathering enough pellets reveals either a piece of fruit that sends Pac-Man to the next maze, or a Power Pellet that can be used to eat ghosts. Unlike previous iterations of Pac-Man, in which touching ghosts would instantly kill Pac-Man, ghosts can now be bumped into up to three times in succession before they enter an Angry state, during which touching them will cause Pac-Man to lose a life. Similar to Championship DX, passing by sleeping ghosts will add them to a trail behind the other ghosts, allowing for large point bonuses when eaten. Players can also use jump pads to jump over parts of a maze and bombs to instantly return to the start of a maze. The game features two main modes: Score Attack, in which players must try and rack up a high score within a time limit, and Adventure, which requires players to clear several objectives, including fighting giant bosses.http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/pac-man-championship- edition-2-review/1900-6416518/ The Nintendo Switch 'Plus' version also features a co-op mode.

She is the second ship of the Philippine Navy to be named after Andr√©s Bonifacio, a Filipino revolutionary leader, regarded as the \\"Father of the Philippine Revolution\\" and one of the most influential national heroes of the Philippines. She was originally designated upon commissioning as \\"FF-17\\". In February 2019, the Navy downgraded the status of the entire class from frigate to patrol ship and redesignated her to \\"PS-17\\". Design The ship was designed with a high level of habitability and provides fairly comfortable accommodations, including air conditioning. =Propulsion= The Andres Bonifacio employs the shipboard application of aircraft gas turbine jet engines with the use of controllable pitch propellers. She is equipped with two Pratt & Whitney gas turbines and can propel the ship at speeds up to . Ramon Alcaraz also has two Fairbanks-Morse diesel engines, capable of driving the ship economically at for up to without refueling. A retractable/rotatable bow propulsion unit provides manoeuvrability in tight situations. =Armament= Prior to turn- over to the Philippine Navy, the ship was armed with a Mk.75 Oto Melara 76mm/62cal Compact main gun, two Mk.38 25 mm Bushmaster chain guns at midships, and a Phalanx CIWS system aft. The CIWS and chain guns were removed prior to its turn-over, with the Mk.75 gun remaining. =Flight support= Andres Bonifacio has a flight deck and hangar capable of handling helicopters. The Philippine Navy uses the AgustaWestland AW109E Power naval helicopter as its standard helicopter for the entire class. =Modernization= The Philippine Navy plans to modernize the entire ship of the class, with an initial program to upgrade the ship's sensors, and another program to improve its weapon systems. Several systems were acquired through US Foreign Military Sales (FMS) and Foreign Military Financing (FMF), which includes the BAE Systems Mk. 38 Mod. 2 machine gun system, the SAAB AN/SPS-77 Sea Giraffe AMB 3D air/surface search radar, and the FLIR Systems SeaFLIR 230 Electro- Optical/Infra-Red Camera. Meanwhile, the Philippine Navy will launch a program to acquire, install and integrate several other sensors into the ship, as part of the Horizon 2 phase of the Revised AFP Modernization Program. Among those to be acquired are new Combat Management System (CMS), Hull Mounted Sonar (HMS), and a Radar Electronic Support Measures (R-ESM). Future upgrades are planned to install defensive and offensive missile systems and torpedo launchers, although funding is still being secured and might only be included in the next phase of the Navy's modernization program. History From 1967‚Äì2016 the ship was a high endurance cutter of the United States Coast Guard that was named . The U.S. decommissioned the cutter in early 2016 and the Philippines acquired it under the Excess Defense Articles and the Foreign Assistance Act. The frigate was formally received by the Philippine Navy on July 21, 2016, and commissioned to service on the same day at the USCG base at Alameda, California. She arrived in Manila on December 9, 2016 after port visit in Guam on December 5, 2016. Notable operational deployments In April 2019, the BRP Andres Bonifacio had an unplanned encounter at sea with the frigate Wu Chang (FFG-1205) of the Taiwanese Navy near the Mavulis Island in Batanes. The two ships implemented the Naval Code for Unplanned Encounters at Sea (CUES) during the encounter.

Life Archer was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, on 27 September 1827, the daughter of Andrew and Ann Archer, and was one of four children. Her elder brother, James Archer, was a notable artist. When she was 14 she went to live with two unmarried aunts and she attended a private school.Roderick R. McLean, \\"Archer, Georgina (1827‚Äì1882)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 29 December 2016. Archer lived in Berlin since the mid-1850s, and worked as an English tutor. She is the founder of the Victoria- Lyzeum in Berlin, which opened in January 1869. Archer had organized teachers, funds to pay them and a board of directors. This was a pioneer institution, but it was launched with modest ambitions so as to not intimidate potential pupils. This was a private venture that was supported by Crown Princess Victoria. The ambition was not to start a university but to provide lectures to women whose education had ceased after they left school. Archer, known as Miss Archer, gave some of the lectures but guests included Friedrich Paulsen, Erich Schmidt and Hugo von Tschudi. By 1875 they had more than 900 students taking courses in the history of art, German and French literature, botany, physics, geology, chemistry and pedagogy. Archer had allowed two separate attempts at offering philosophy lectures, but after two teachers were considered unacceptable, the subject was abandoned. Archer's death occurred on 18 November 1882 in Montreux, Switzerland, where she was trying to recover from overwork. Her role in leading the Lyceum was taken on by Alix von Cotta, who had like Archer been educated in England. Cotta introduced even more advanced courses, and the Lyceum trained many women to teach advanced courses at Prussia's 200 public schools for girls.Rita McWilliams Tullberg, \\"Cotta, Alix von (1842‚Äì1931)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 29 December 2016.

He earned regional fame as the \\"Paul Revere of the West\\" or the \\"Prairie Paul Revere\\" for riding on the night of April 19‚Äì20, 1866, first to warn others of an expected Native American attack and‚Äîwhen the threat proved false‚Äîback through a spring blizzard to intercept his request for reinforcements from the U.S. Army. Though the ordeal left him dependent on a wheelchair for the rest of his life, he went on to serve as an educator, civic leader, advocate for Native Americans, and historian. Early life Sam Brown was born on March 7, 1845, in Iowa Territory near Lake Traverse, a location which is now in the state of South Dakota. His father was Joseph R. Brown, who would go on to be a notable Indian agent and politician. His mother was Susan Freniere Brown, a mixed blood descendant of Dakota chief Tatanka Mani. Sam Brown was thus one-eighth Dakota and an accepted member of the Sisseton band. Brown was 17 when the Dakota War of 1862 broke out. He was among the numerous mixed-blood and noncombatant Dakota taken captive by their warring cousins during the conflict. Most were freed during the surrender at Camp Release, Brown included, and he joined the Minnesota militia as a scout while Western Dakota continued to resist U.S. expansion. Under the command of his own father, Brown was ultimately posted to Fort Wadsworth beyond the border of Minnesota in Dakota Territory. This fort, later renamed Fort Sisseton, was established in 1864 to protect non-hostile Eastern Dakota and guard against further attack on white settlers. Among a semi-military scouting unit composed of white frontiersmen, mixed-bloods, and allied Eastern Dakotas, Brown helped locate hostile encampments, rode patrols, provided escorts, and served as an interpreter and courier. He distinguished himself in his duties and was promoted to scout inspector in March 1866, the month he turned 21. He was soon supervising scouts for the entire district. The ride On April 19, 1866, a Dakota chief known as O√ºiduze reported to Brown that five days earlier he had seen moccasin tracks from what he took to be a war party heading from the James River near Jamestown, North Dakota, toward white settlements at the head of the Minnesota River. Brown immediately dispatched a warning to Lieutenant Colonel C. P. Adams, in command of the area's largest U.S. force at nearby Fort Abercrombie. He then set off himself to alert a scout encampment deep in unfriendly territory on the Elm River near present-day Ordway, South Dakota. Brown left Fort Wadsworth just as night was falling and rode the across the dark, nearly featureless prairie in just five hours, navigating by the North Star. However when Brown reached the Elm River station at midnight with his warning, chief scout Joseph Rouilliard assured him that the tracks had been left by messengers dispatched by Brown's own father to call Dakotas in western Minnesota to a peace council at Fort Rice. Brown immediately realized that the false alarm he'd sent to Fort Abercrombie could mistakenly lead U.S. soldiers into provoking an actual war. Despite his exhaustion, Brown knew he had to correct his mistake. Nor could he wait till daylight, when a lone horseman on the prairie would be vulnerable to any genuinely hostile natives. Rouilliard provided a fresh horse and Brown set off to retrace his journey. However the sky had clouded over, covering the North Star, and he could see a storm approaching from the west. He had just passed the halfway point thinking he would outrun the storm when a violent wind nearly tore him from the saddle. This was followed by freezing rain that turned to hail then snow, and soon enough Brown found himself in the grip of a freak spring blizzard. With no landmarks or stars, he simply kept the wind on his back to stay on course. Twice his mount broke through ice, spilling Brown into frigid rivers. At daybreak Brown found himself on the western slope of the Coteau des Prairies. From the ridgeline, however, he found to his dismay that the wind must have shifted during the night, leading him southwest of Fort Wadsworth. The blizzard still raged and now Brown was forced to face into the wind as he corrected course. Soon his legs, fingers, and face were numb from the cold. He could have taken shelter in a wooded ravine, but Brown was determined to fulfill his mission. He reached Fort Wadsworth's scout headquarters around 8:00 in the morning. He dismounted and immediately collapsed, his legs unable to support him. He managed to see to his horse before crawling into the scout cabin and falling unconscious. He woke up in mid-afternoon and stumbled a quarter mile to the next scout's cabin, where he was able to get word to his commanding officer Lieutenant James F. Cochrane, who dispatched a courier to Fort Abercrombie to cancel the alert. Sam Brown was just 21 when he made his epic ride, covering in 15 hours in horrific conditions. He was never able to walk again, and spent the rest of his life dependent on a wheelchair. Brown also wrote that the ride \\"deranged my eyes, dimmed my eyesight, paralyzed my muscular powers, deprived me of the use of my legs, and of all natural power of motion, and permanently impaired my general health.\\" Later life Brown's father Joseph gained title to and founded a town in Minnesota which became known, after his death in 1870, as Browns Valley. Brown Senior had the scout headquarters building moved there, where father and son used it as a private residence, trading post, and stagecoach inn. Sam Brown opened a post office in the building and became the town's first postmaster. Two years later, in 1867, he became the first notary public in Traverse County. One-eighth Dakota, Sam Brown became closely involved in native‚Äìwhite relations. He was an advocate for the local Dakota bands, campaigning, for example, to secure annuities for native scouts who had assisted the U.S. Army. He worked to provide educational and religious services to Native Americans as a teacher and lay preacher at an Episcopal mission, superintendent of a trade school, and editor of a publication called Daylight. He was also involved in various business dealings, primarily real estate. Marrying, he and his wife Phebe would have four children. Later in life he became interested in history, writing several articles and corresponding with other historians about frontier life and the Dakota War of 1862. Of his famous ride, though, he would merely say \\"it is nothing to talk about. I did my duty as I saw it. That is all.\\" He died in Browns Valley on August 29, 1925, at the age of 80. Legacy Sam Brown earned regional fame for his 1866 ride, enhanced by his civic achievements and relation to a major figure in Minnesota history. Shortly after his death, citizens of Browns Valley successfully lobbied the state to establish a memorial. Now known as Sam Brown Memorial State Wayside, it includes interpretive signage and the 1864 scout headquarters building, which is operated by the Browns Valley Historical Society as a museum.

The most visible way for graduates of Texas A&M; to recognize each other is by the Aggie Ring. The Aggie Ring is worn by current students and alumni, and is one of the most well-known symbols of the Aggie Network.  History and appearance  The Texas A&M; ring was formally adopted in 1889. The current Aggie Ring was designed by E. C. Jonas in 1894, and the design has remained relatively unchanged since, with the only major change coming when the school's name was changed from the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas to Texas A&M; University in 1963. The top of the Ring depicts an eagle and shield. The shield at the top of the Ring symbolizes protection of the reputation of the alma mater. The thirteen stripes in the shield represent the thirteen original states and symbolize patriotism. The five stars in the shield refer to the facets of student development: mind, body, spiritual attainment, emotional poise, and integrity of character. The eagle denotes agility, power, and ability to reach great heights. On one side of the Ring is a large star, borrowed from the seal of the state of Texas. The oak leaves symbolize strength. On the other side of the Ring are a cannon, a saber, and a rifle, symbolizing Aggies' preparedness and valor in defending their land. The crossed flags of the United States and Texas symbolize allegiance to both nation and state. Traditionally, students wear their Rings with the class year facing them to signify the fact that their time at A&M; is not yet complete. At the annual Ring Dance, or at the end of the student's collegiate career, the student turns his Ring around so that the class year faces away, symbolizing readiness to \\"face the world.\\" For decades, though unsanctioned and discouraged by the University, an unofficial tradition among willing students involves \\"dunking\\" the newly acquired Aggie Ring. The Ring is dropped in a pitcher of beer and the student chugs the entire pitcher and catches the Ring in his or her teeth. The Dixie Chicken, among other bars, has been one of the more popular venues for dunking Aggie Rings, though it no longer endorses the activity. Some students choose to dunk their Rings in alternative substances, including ice cream or nonalcoholic beverages.  Requirements to receive the ring  The Aggie Ring cannot be purchased unless specific requirements are met: a current student must be in good standing with a minimum 2.00 GPA on a 4.00 scale. In addition, the student must have completed 90 hours of coursework, including at least 45 hours at A&M.; Graduate students may receive a Ring after 75% of their graduate coursework is completed. If a graduate degree requires a thesis, the ring will be delivered on Aggie Ring Day if the thesis has been defended by the deadline set by the Office of Graduate Studies. If the thesis has not been defended by this date, the Aggie Ring will be held until the qualification is met. A Ph.D. student may receive their Ring if they have completed all formal coursework in the degree plan, has a cumulative GPA of 3.0 or above, has successfully completed the residency requirement, has successfully passed the preliminary exam, and has an approved research proposal on file. A Ring may be purchased upon graduation if a student, either undergraduate or graduate, did not meet these criteria while pursuing the degree. Many students receive their Rings on Aggie Ring Day, which is held at the Clayton W. Williams, Jr. Alumni Center three times yearly. Aggie Ring Day is a special time for Aggies, their family, and their friends to celebrate being a part of the Aggie Network. The Association of Former Students gave out over 11,000 Rings at Aggie Ring Days in 2012.

He founded the Yarmouk Martyrs Brigade, which became connected to the Islamic State under his leadership and which he led until his death. Biography Muhammad al-Baridi was born in 1970 in the village of Jamla, Daraa Governorate, Syria. He was born into the Baridi family/clan that is local to the Yarmouk Valley. The Baridis are prominent landowners in the area. His father was a well-known and wealthy landowner working in agriculture and his son followed in his father's footsteps from the beginning of his working life. Muhammad then moved into selling produce in the Deraa markets while not abandoning agricultural work. Due to his wealthy family, he had a relatively good education. He studied Arabic language for a time at Damascus University, though he does not appear to have graduated with a degree. =Ideology= The group he led, the Yarmouk Martyrs Brigade, originally had a nationalist orientation, working in cooperation with Syrian rebel groups. It later switched its orientation to an Islamic one, and it is believed that Muhammad held radical views for many years prior to the outbreak of the Syrian Civil War. =Imprisonment= At some point he was imprisoned by the Syrian government of Bashar al-Assad. The charges he was subject to are in dispute, with claims that he was imprisoned on account of thefts of antiquities from archaeological sites and other claims that it was on account of 'extremist' tendencies. Two men speaking to Aymenn Jawad Al-Tamimi, an expert in the dynamics of the war in Southern Syria, assert that he had been imprisoned by the regime twice before the revolution- each time for less than a year. It is said that Muhammad al-Baridi desired the implementation of Islamic law before the revolution. Another sources says he was imprisoned because \\"he was interested in extremist thought\\" and had been released after the beginning of the revolution as part of the \\"second amnesty\\" issued by the regime for a number of political prisoners over some months in 2011. On this reading it is likely he was imprisoned in Sednaya Prison. It is said that he wished to go to Iraq but could not because the Syrian mukhabarat caught up with him. =Death= He was assassinated 15 November 2015, alongside several other members of his top leadership in his hometown of Jamla in a suicide attack carried out by Jabhat al-Nusra. =Family= He had six daughters and two sons. Of the two sons, he did not see one of them as his wife gave birth to this son two months after his death.

In January 2002, Cabcharge acquired Combined Communications Network to provide taxi booking and dispatch services in Sydney. Today, it provides taxi booking and dispatch services through Taxi Networks in New South Wales (Combined Communications NetworkCombined Communications Network) and 13CABS in Victoria.13CABS Today, over 7,000 taxis operate on Cabcharge booking and dispatch networks in Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide and Newcastle. In March 2003 it acquired Black Cabs, Melbourne's second largest taxi company, to be followed by Newcastle Taxis and Melbourne's Arrow Taxis. In 2001, Cabcharge formed a joint venture with Singapore-based DelGro Corporation (now ComfortDelGro) to form CityFleet Networks in the United Kingdom, in which Cabcharge held a 49% interest. In 2005, Cabcharge formed another joint venture company with ComfortDelGro to form ComfortDelGro Cabcharge (CDC) in Australia, in which Cabcharge held a 49% interest. CDC purchased the Westbus Group and later the Baxter's Bus Lines and Blue Ribbon. In 2009, CDC purchased the Kefford Corporation in Victoria, and expanded by acquiring other bus operations.

Outline A2B Australia's principal activities include: * provision of charge account facilities for businesses and individuals to enable non-cash payment of taxi fares. * development of a point-of-sale system that allows taxi users to pay their fare using third party charge, credit and debit cards and Cabcharge products. The system requires passengers to pay a 10% surcharge on their fare although the surcharge is currently being reviewed by the Reserve Bank of Australia following public comments and complaints that the surcharge is excessive.\\"Reserve moves to tackle card fee\\", Peter Martin, The Age, 21 March 2012. The surcharge has been limited in New South Wales and Victoria to 5%. * software development. * provision of taxi booking and dispatch services. Additional capture of taxi owners, operators and drivers is practised through provision of services including repairs and installation of in-vehicle equipment, insurance, vehicle leasing and training. * development of taxi- related hardware and software like taxi security camera systems, meters, and transaction processing equipment. Federal Court action by ACCC In June 2009, the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission (ACCC) began proceedings in the Federal Court of Australia against Cabcharge alleging that Cabcharge had breached the Trade Practices Act (TPA) by misusing its market power and entering into an agreement to substantially lessen competition. The action centered on Cabcharge's conduct in refusing to deal with competing suppliers to allow Cabcharge payments to be processed through EFTPOS terminals provided by rival companies and supplying taxi meters and fare updates at below actual cost or at no cost.; . On 24 September 2010, Cabcharge admitted to three contraventions of the TPA to settle the proceedings. The Federal Court approved the settlement, and declared that Cabcharge had breached the TPA by taking advantage of its substantial degree of power in the Australian markets for the supply of services to enable non-cash payments for taxi fares and charges by taxi passengers and non-cash instruments that could be used only for the payment of taxi fares and charges. The Court imposed the highest ever penalty for misuse of market power, imposing a fine of $15 million ($14 million in civil penalties and $1 million in costs).

At 12 years old, she joined the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). Civil rights leader At only 13 years old, Savage helped to integrate the Capital Theater in Trenton, New Jersey, when she refused to sit in the balcony, which was the designated seating area for blacks. Savage's first job was in the sheriff's office, where she continued to speak out against discrimination. In 1957, while Savage was raising funds for King's Southern Leadership Conference, she was introduced to civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. King and his wife, Coretta Scott King, became Savage's close friends. After Martin's death, Savage worked with Coretta to found the King Center. In 1964, Savage and then first lady of New Jersey Helen Meyner went on a presidential mission to integrate a school in Mississippi. Savage and Meyner met with local women in an effort to convince the locals to allow for the school to be integrated peacefully. Later that same year, she organized the New Jersey Democratic Coalition. In 2017, she was a keynote speaker at the Women's March in Trenton. Other activities Savage was the coordinator of the Mid-Atlantic States Poor People's Campaign of SCLC in 1968. President Jimmy Carter appointed her as a U.S. Delegate at the World Women‚Äôs Conference in Houston, Texas in 1977. Besides promoting civil rights, Savage wanted to combat problems in the African-American community through education. She believed the importance of parenting and mentoring to give children role models. Personal life On October 28, 1993, Savage married C. Donald Jennings. Rosa Parks attended the wedding and Coretta Scott King served as maid of honor. Her husband died on June 19, 2011 at age 94. Death Savage died on November 12, 2017 at her home in Trenton, New Jersey at the age of 93. Awards and honors Savage received more than 100 awards and honors for her work in Civil Rights. She was inducted into the New Jersey Women's Hall of Fame in 2011. The city of Trenton proclaimed February 19, 2016 as Edith Savage-Jennings Day.

It was discovered in 2007 in stored samples of human respiratory secretions collected by the Karolinska Institute, after which the virus is named. Discovery KI virus was discovered in 2007 in samples of human respiratory secretions being systematically searched as part of a program for identifying novel human viruses. It was identified by sequence homology to known human polyomaviruses BK virus and JC virus, and simian polyomavirus SV40. KI virus was the third human polyomavirus described and the first to be discovered since BK and JC in 1971. A very similar respiratory virus, WU virus, was also reported later in 2007. Genome Genome structure of the WU virus. KI virus has a near-identical structure with a slightly different length of 5040 base pairs. The complete genome of the KI virus has been sequenced and found to be a circular double-stranded DNA genome of 5040 base pairs containing genetic material characteristic of polyomaviruses, encoding five viral proteins: three capsid components, major capsid protein VP1, VP2, and VP3; and two additional proteins involved in replication, the large tumor antigen and small tumor antigen. Prevalence The prevalence of KI virus as detected by the presence of its DNA in human samples is generally estimated in the 1-5% range in various locations and populations, with some indication of age-dependence. The virus has been detected in the respiratory secretions of children with respiratory infections in multiple locations. By contrast, one 2009 study placed seroprevalence - that is, prevalence of antibodies against the virus (in this case the VP1 coat protein) - as high as 55% among a population of American adults and 56% among a population of American children. Another 2009 study found around 70% seroprevalence for adults, with age patterns indicating that infants may inherit maternal antibodies against both WU and KI. A 2016 study of polyomavirus seroprevalence found WU virus in 91.3% of samples from another American population. Primary infection is generally believed to occur in childhood. Disease association KI virus, like its close relative WU virus, is not known to be associated with any clinical disease despite its presence in respiratory secretions. The rate of co-infection with other respiratory viruses is high, so it is difficult to assign causality to KI virus even where clinical symptoms are present. Some polyomaviruses are well known as carcinogenic, including the human polyomavirus Merkel cell polyomavirus, but KI virus has also not been associated with cancer. While no clear association with clinical symptoms has been identified, there is weak indication that WU and KI viruses may have pathogenic potential in immunocompromised patients. Nomenclature and classification KI virus got its name from the Karolinska Institute, the institutional affiliation of the researchers who discovered and reported the virus. Among the human polyomaviruses, KI is most similar to WU virus. A 2010 proposed classification recommended the division of the polyomaviruses into three genera, containing one genus of avian viruses and two of mammalian viruses; one of the latter was designated Wukipolyomavirus to indicate its two founding members.

Records from the 1600s refer to the church as , so it was likely dedicated to Saint Jacob. The medieval church stood on the site for centuries and over time it was renovated, repaired, and rebuilt. Records show that from 1734-1740, the church underwent an extensive renovation project to repair the very old church. It is likely that by then the church bared little resemblance to the original church but rather looked like a patchwork of old an old stave church and newer timber-framed construction. Around the turn of the 19th century, the old church was torn down and a new building was constructed on the same site. The new cruciform church was partially completed in 1803 when it was put into use. It was finished over the next four years and it was consecrated on 8 July 1807.

When Wilson Fisk is released from prison, Murdock must decide between hiding from the world or embracing his life as a hero vigilante. The season is set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), sharing continuity with the films and other television series of the franchise. It is produced by Marvel Television in association with ABC Studios, with Erik Oleson serving as showrunner, and series creator Drew Goddard acting as consultant. Charlie Cox stars as Murdock and Vincent D'Onofrio portrays Fisk, with Deborah Ann Woll, Elden Henson, and Stephen Rider also returning from previous seasons; Joanne Whalley, Jay Ali, and Wilson Bethel join them. Former series regular Ayelet Zurer also returns in a guest role. The season was ordered in July 2016, with Oleson announced as new showrunner for the season in October 2017. Filming began the following month and ended by June 2018, with the season adapting elements from the \\"Born Again\\" comic storyline. The 13-episode season was released on October 19, 2018. Netflix canceled the series on November 29, 2018. Episodes Cast and characters =Main= * Charlie Cox as Matt Murdock / Daredevil * Deborah Ann Woll as Karen Page * Elden Henson as Franklin \\"Foggy\\" Nelson * Joanne Whalley as Maggie Grace * Jay Ali as Rahul \\"Ray\\" Nadeem * Wilson Bethel as Benjamin \\"Dex\\" Poindexter * Stephen Rider as Blake Tower * Vincent D'Onofrio as Wilson Fisk / Kingpin =Recurring= * Peter McRobbie as Paul Lantom * Danny Johnson as Benjamin Donovan * Stephen Rowe as Nicholas Lee * Kate Udall as Tammy Hattley * Sunita Deshpande as Seema Nadeem * Noah Huq as Sami Nadeem * Geoffrey Cantor as Mitchell Ellison * Peter Halpin as Theo Nelson * Amy Rutberg as Marci Stahl * Holly Cinnamon as Julie Barnes * Royce Johnson as Brett Mahoney * Joe Jones as Felix Manning * Kelly McAndrews as Mrs. Shelby =Notable guests= * Matt Gerald as Melvin Potter * John Patrick Hayden as Jack Murdock * Annabella Sciorra as Rosalie Carbone * Ron Simons as Strieber * Ayelet Zurer as Vanessa Marianna-Fisk Production =Development= At San Diego Comic-Con International 2016, Marvel and Netflix revealed the series had been renewed for a third season, with the expectation that Doug Petrie and Marco Ramirez would return as showrunners from the second season. In October 2017, it was announced that Erik Oleson would replace Petrie and Ramirez as showrunner for the season. The season had yet to be scheduled for release by the end of July 2018, and television critics wondered whether the quality of the season was to blame on this. Netflix VP Cindy Holland responded that the scheduling of the various Marvel Netflix series, especially the crossover miniseries The Defenders which required cast members from all of the series to come together, was to blame for the delay, and that the company had no issue with the quality of the season; on the contrary, Holland described the season as \\"fantastic\\" and felt it was a \\"real return to form\\" for the series. =Writing= The ending of the miniseries The Defenders, which sees Matt Murdock waking up in a convent surrounded by nuns after being presumed dead, implied elements of the season would be inspired by the \\"Born Again\\" story arc. Charlie Cox was excited to adapt \\"Born Again\\", calling it \\"an amazing story\\" and that the implications of the story on the season \\"would be exciting\\". He cautioned, however, that it would not be a \\"page-for-page\\" adaptation, \\"because if you do [that], then you become a foregone conclusion. There may be elements from \\"Born Again\\", but I'm sure there will be elements that are unfamiliar and surprising and different in order for the show to be compelling to fans who know the comics very well.\\" Oleson crafted an original story for the season, taking \\"pieces of some of my favorite comic book runs, that told a larger story\\". When pitching his ideas to Marvel, Oleson expected \\"more pushback\\" from them, but said \\"Marvel was incredibly excited about the storyline\\" and gave him \\"complete freedom\\". Executive producer Jeph Loeb did note that despite this apparent freedom, Oleson was still required to deal with Murdock's death in The Defenders which was part of \\"a fairly good idea as to what [Marvel] wanted to tackle in terms of story\\" before Oleson presented his ideas. Oleson drew inspiration from \\"Born Again\\" and \\"Guardian Devil\\" for the tone of the season. Building the season structurally, Oleson felt if any viewer was \\"a devout Catholic... you could read into the events of the early episodes as a message from god to Matt\\". At the start of the season, Oleson noted that Murdock would be \\"broken physically, broken emotionally, and broken spiritually\\", with his heightened senses failing him. Oleson added, \\"He's angry at God, he's angry at the fact that he had risked his life to do God's work, and he's questioning whether or not he was a fool.\\" This results in Murdock donning his original black suit, similar to the one he wore in season one, since he \\"goes to pretty much the darkest place you can\\" and is at a point, Oleson notes, \\"[w]hen he realizes that he's incapable of being Daredevil, [and] he would rather just end it than go forward in his life without abilities.\\" This also allowed Oleson to return the character \\"to the core idea\\" of being a boxer's son, \\"where his fighting style was more brutal and kind of close in combat\\". Oleson also wanted \\"to make the action sequences matter in ways that reflected on characters, or had real stakes\\". He added, \\"the best writing is one where the action sequences are an inherent part of the story and you cannot predict that the action is going to turn out a certain way.\\" Regarding the return of Wilson Fisk / Kingpin, Oleson called him \\"smarter, more calculated, and more manipulative,\\" and felt his inclusion allowed the ability to \\"tell a story that‚Äôs relevant to the world around us. I looked at the show as a way to examine how tyrants manipulate in order to push their own agenda and cause fear and distrust.\\" Loeb felt the season went \\"back to the world of the crime story\\". Karen Page's backstory is further explored in the season, with Woll explaining it reveals \\"why shooting someone [James Wesley] and covering it up is a bit more in her wheelhouse,\\" while Foggy Nelson's family and additional backstory is also seen. All of the supporting characters in the season were treated \\"as emotionally real people as opposed to treating them as props or devices\\". Oleson wanted them to be \\"the protagonist of their own journey\\", modeling this approach after the series Breaking Bad, Game of Thrones, The Sopranos, and The Wire. Benjamin \\"Dex\\" Poindexter does not go by Bullseye in the season. In the season's final sequence, Dex's spine is being operated on before the camera zooms into his face and a bullseye appears in his eye. Oleson \\"was very interested in telling an origin story not only about how a character we know from the comics as a full-blown psychopath and killer, but how somebody in real life could be turned into something like that.\\" This origin also spoke to the overall theme for the season of fear, which touched the story arcs of Murdock, Page, and Fisk as well. Psychiatrists and psychologists were consulted to help create \\"a realistic portrait of Dex and how he might be able to turn into Bullseye\\". =Casting= Cox, Woll, Henson, and D'Onofrio all return in the season, reprising their roles as Matt Murdock / Daredevil, Karen Page, Foggy Nelson, and Wilson Fisk / Kingpin, respectively. Rider also returns as Blake Tower. In November 2017, Wilson Bethel was cast as a new series regular, Benjamin \\"Dex\\" Poindexter, and in January 2018, Joanne Whalley was revealed to have been cast as Maggie Grace, a nun who cares deeply about Murdock's safety, and was mentioned at the end of The Defenders. Jay Ali was cast as Rahul \\"Ray\\" Nadeem, another FBI agent, by March. Recurring characters in the season include Peter McRobbie as Paul Lantom, Danny Johnson as Benjamin Donovan, Geoffrey Cantor as Mitchell Ellison, Amy Rutberg as Marci Stahl, and Royce Johnson as Brett Mahoney, all of whom are reprising their roles from earlier seasons. Other recurring characters include Stephen Rowe as Nicholas Lee, one of Fisk's lawyers; Kate Udall as Tammy Hattley, the Special Agent in Charge of the FBI; Sunita Deshpande as Seema Nadeem and Noah Huq as Sami Nadeem, Ray's wife and son, respectively; Peter Halpin as Theo Nelson, Foggy's brother created for the series; Holly Cinnamon as Julie Barnes, a friend of Dex; Joe Jones as Felix Manning, Fisk's fixer; Kelly McAndrews as Mrs. Shelby, Fisk's surveillance technician; and Matthew McCurdy, Don Castro, Scotty Crow, Richard Prioleau, David Anthony Buglione, Sam Slater, and Andrew Sensenig as FBI agents Wellers, Arinori, Lim, Doyle, Johnson, O'Connor, and Winn, respectively. Characters making guest appearances from the first two seasons and other MCU media include Matt Gerald as Melvin Potter, John Patrick Hayden as Jack Murdock, Annabella Sciorra as Rosalie Carbone, following up on her character's introduction in the second season of Luke Cage, Ron Simons as NYPD captain Strieber, following his appearance in The Defenders, and former main cast member Ayelet Zurer as Vanessa Marianna-Fisk. Former Daredevil comic writer and editor Roy Thomas has a cameo appearance as prison inmate in episode 4. =Design= Costume designer Liz Vastola noted Daredevil's black suit was \\"purposely ripped and jagged to highlight Matt‚Äôs state of mind\\" throughout the season. Vastola described Page's wardrobe as \\"fucking fierce\\" as Page transitions into more of an investigative journalist. Foggy Nelson's look is a \\"complete 180\\" from what he was wearing in season one, with the character now wearing suits made by Martin Greenfield Clothiers. =Filming= Filming for the season began on November 13, 2017, in New York City. A week of filming for the season in March 2018 took place in the town of Windham, New York, with set photos revealing that the town was representing Fagan Corners, Vermont, the hometown of Karen Page in the comics. The production paid for the renovation of a local store to portray a diner for the series, and used the town's emergency helicopter pad. Additional filming locations for the week included nearby ski areas and a country club. The exterior of the Lotte New York Palace Hotel served as the building of Fisk's penthouse while under FBI surveillance. An abandoned prison in Staten Island was used for the riot sequence in episode four.https://www.vulture.com/2018/10/daredevil- season-3-one-take-fight-scene.html Filming for the season was completed by mid-June 2018. \\"Blindsided\\" features a long action sequence filmed in a single take. Oleson credited the episode's director Alex Garcia Lopez, writer Lewaa Nasserdeen, and the stunt team for conceiving the idea. Once the sequence was decided, Oleson asked Marvel to give them a full day to rehearse the sequence, which \\"no one had ever done before\\", since \\"it required every single member of the crew to work in perfect sync.\\" Oleson said once \\"the crew finally pulled it off, it was something spectacular that injected adrenaline into the crew for the remainder of the season.\\" The sequence, which does not feature any hidden edit cuts, was meant to be a \\"homage, and then one-upping\\" of the sequence from season one. Several moments were included in the sequence where the editing team could add a cut if needed, though they did not need them. While editing the episode, Oleson increased the lighting in certain shots \\"so that the audience could see that we never cut the camera\\". Cox called the completed sequence \\"amazing\\", adding it was \\"a real testament to the stunt team\\". =Music= Composer John Paesano once again returns for the season. A soundtrack album for the season was released digitally by Hollywood Records on October 19, 2018. All music composed by John Paesano, unless otherwise noted. Marketing By mid-June 2018, discussions were underway regarding the season being promoted at San Diego Comic-Con that year. A teaser trailer for the season was included as a post-credits scene at the end of the second season of Iron Fist. A full trailer for the season was released on October 4, 2018, which also confirmed Bethel's role as Benjamin Poindexter in the season. Cox, Henson, Woll, D'Onofrio, Whalley, Bethel, and Ali promoted the season at New York Comic Con on October 6, 2018. Release The third season of Daredevil was released on October 19, 2018 on the streaming service Netflix, worldwide, in Ultra HD 4K. Initially thought to be releasing in 2017, Netflix COO Ted Sarandos stated in July 2016 that the season would not debut until 2018 at the earliest, after The Defenders released on August 18, 2017. Cox was hopeful the season would debut in 2018, and in October 2017, Marvel revealed the season was indeed expected to release in 2018. In mid-September 2018, the season's release date was revealed. Critical response The review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 97% approval rating based on 64 reviews, with an average rating of 8.06/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"The Man with No Fear returns to top form with a third season that begins tediously slow but gradually generates comic book thrills, immeasurably helped by the welcome return of Vincent D'Onofrio's menacing Kingpin.\\" Metacritic reported a score of 71 based on 6 reviews.

They find the watch of another contestant, Pierce Higgins (Logan Miller) in the contestant's possession and deduce that he may be a suspect. Adalind (Claire Coffee) turns out to be living in Vienna and meets with Renard's brother, Eric (James Frain). He reveals that while they share the same father, Renard's mother was a Hexenbiest. Renard is only half-royal and, because of his bastard status, he and his mother were forced to move to Portland. Pierce deduces that his mother (Mary Page Keller) is the killer and calls Nick and Hank. However, Pierce discovers he is in fact the killer, as his mother altered him before he was born to be a L√∂wen and a Genio Innocuo at the same time, and his L√∂wen part is committing the crime. He escapes and attempts to commit suicide, but is stopped by Nick at the last minute. He is placed in prison and uses his L√∂wen side to attack inmates. Renard's condition continues deteriorating, and he decides to find an antidote from Monroe (Silas Weir Mitchell) in the spice shop. Monroe states that the antidote may be difficult to find if he does not discover who is the person he is getting affected by and whom it could also affect. Renard debates whether or not to tell him, as Nick could know.

The A.V. Club's Kevin McFarland gave the episode a \\"C+\\" grade and wrote, \\"Early in its run, Grimm used its epigraphs as a way to introduce whatever fairy tale was the topic of the episode's major plot. As the show progressed, the epigraphs became indicative of some thematic resonance between a tale and an episode. Now, the writer's seem to be combing any and all fairy tale-adjacent material for quotes to fit a plot that never sprang from the Grimm tales themselves. I understand why the source material can be limiting, but the writers have shown a range of literary influences. Episodes that contrast strong in-show mythology with a scramble to tie in fairy tale elements shows how over- complication of this world may not be playing to Grimms advantage.\\" Emily Rome of EW wrote, \\"This episode, called 'The Other Side,' was not without some forward momentum for the continuing stories of Juliette and Renards potion- induced obsession with each other and of Adalind's return. Once the show established the group of ill-fated academic decathlon kids, it moved on to Nick and Juliette getting ready for a dinner in Renard's honor ‚Äì he received an award for his work with the Portland Police. A thank you from Nick to Juliette for accompanying him to a dinner he hopes isn't too dull is met with Juliette's response of, 'Of course. This is what couples do ‚Äì they go to each other's boring work functions.'\\" Nick McHatton from TV Fanatic gave a 4.0 star rating out of 5, stating: \\"'The Other Side' sets its procedural story up as one large metaphor for the upcoming drama that is about to unfold. I just wish the killer kid story hadn't been used back-to-back. Thankfully, Pierce being the culprit isn't the main takeaway from the story ‚Äì it's his genetics. Pierce is half Lowen, half Genio Innocuo, and, because of that, if he can't keep his emotions in check his violent side comes out. It's a light twist to what Renard is going through.\\" Shilo Adams from TV Overmind, wrote: \\"In the world of Grimm, knowledge is the type of leverage needed to survive. Nick had to learn quickly about the Wesen world in order to become a better Grimm, Hank's reaction to the news that Nick can see creatures as well was one of comfort, and Juliette has been trying to get her memory back in order to fully love her partner once again. With Monroe having to pick up information at the spice shop in Rosalee's absence, Renard continuing to obsess over Juliette with no end in sight, and Adalind attempting to get in good with the royal family to get vengeance for her mother, knowledge played a big part in 'The Other Side'.\\" Josie Campbell from TV.com wrote, \\"Up until the ending, 'The Other Side' was a great Wesen-of-the-week episode that did a nice job of balancing Adalind's plotting and mythology with cop-procedural action. It was fun to see Monroe geek out about the spice shop and Hank get upset about the Grimms' bloody past. Plus Renard is such a strong character that I even liked the Juliette storyline. But Nick and Hank's cynical shrugging-off of a mentally unbalanced kid who desperately needed help not only felt out of character for both of them, it also destroyed the whole premise of Grimm ‚Äî that Nick, despite being a Grimm, is still a good guy.\\" References External links Grimm (season 2) episodes 2012 American television episodes ","title":"The Other Side (Grimm)"},{"id":"51133607","text":"Giovanni Barbo (died 16 January, 1547) was a Roman Catholic prelate who served as Bishop of Pedena (1526‚Äì1547).\\"Bishop Giovanni Barbo\\" Catholic- Hierarchy.org.

In June 2009, the ACCC began proceedings in the Federal Court against Cabcharge alleging that Cabcharge had breached section 46 of the Commonwealth Trade Practices Act (TPA) by misusing its market power and entering into an agreement to substantially lessen competition. The action alleged predatory pricing by Cabcharge and centred on Cabcharge's conduct in refusing to deal with competing suppliers to allow Cabcharge payments to be processed through EFTPOS terminals provided by rival companies and supplying taxi meters and fare updates at below actual cost or at no cost. In September 2010, to settle the action, Cabcharge admitted a number of contraventions of TPA and the Federal Court imposed a fine of $15 million ($14 million in civil penalties and $1 million in costs), the highest ever penalty imposed for misuse of market power. The judgement was delivered by Justice Raymond Finkelstein on 17 November 2010. Background Cabcharge provides various products and services in Australia and overseas, predominantly to taxi drivers, owners and networks (the firms that provide booking and dispatch services to drivers and owners). The services that Cabcharge provide include non-cash payment processing systems for taxi fares, payment processing systems for taxis and provision of taxi meters. The company holds a dominant market position in these services across Australia as it supplies almost 97% of Australian taxis with its electronic payment system. The ACCC began proceedings in June 2009 in the Federal Court against Cabcharge Australia Ltd. The ACCC action alleged that Cabcharge had breached section 46 of the Trade Practices Act (TPA) by misusing its market power and entering into an agreement to substantially lessen competition. The action alleged predatory pricing by Cabcharge and centred on Cabcharge's conduct in refusing to deal with competing suppliers to allow Cabcharge payments to be processed through EFTPOS terminals provided by rival companies and supplying taximeters and meter updates at below actual cost or at no cost. At the relevant date, to breach Section 46 of the TPA, a corporation must have misused its substantial market power to: * eliminate or substantially damage a competitor * prevent the entry of a person into that market or any other market; or * deter or prevent a person from engaging in competitive conduct in that market or any other market. Section 46 of the TPA was amended numerous times since September 2007 to strengthen the ACCC's ability to successfully bring proceedings for alleged contraventions. For example, in September 2007, a sub-section 46(1AA) was introduced into the TPA to prohibit corporations with substantial market share from engaging in predatory pricing. Predatory pricing occurs when a company sets its prices below cost for a sustained period for one of the anti- competitive purposes referred to above. In November 2008, the TPA was amended again to make clear the circumstances when corporations had 'taken advantage' of their market power. This change sought to deal with the evidentiary difficulties the regulator encountered in establishing this element in earlier cases. Since January 2007, the courts have also been given power to impose a civil penalty for each act or omission contravening the TPA. Civil penalties can now be imposed up to the greater of $10 million, three times the value of the benefit obtained from the misconduct, or 10% of the annual Australian turnover of the company involved. Resolution =Cabcharge admissions= To settle the proceedings, Cabcharge admitted to three contraventions of the TPA. The company agreed to the issue by the court of declarations, compliance orders, civil penalties of $14 million and costs of $1 million. = Cabcharge settlement = On 24 September 2010, Justice Finkelstein approved the settlement of the action and declared that Cabcharge had breached the TPA by taking advantage of its substantial degree of power in the Australian markets for the supply of services to enable non-cash payments for taxi fares and charges by taxi passengers and non-cash instruments that could be used only for the payment of taxi fares and charges. Judgement =Refusal to deal= It was found that since 2005 Cabcharge had unreasonably refused to deal with a potential competitor (namely Travel Tab which had changed its name to Mpos in January 2007) in the payments and instruments markets by refusing to allow Travel Tab/MPos to process Cabcharge instruments (e.g., Cabcharge cards) on Mpos EFTPOS equipment. It was found that: \\"With respect to both refusals, Cabcharge acknowledges that although there would have been time and costs involved in developing appropriate interfaces, there was no technical reason that would prevent any electronic taxi-specific payment product from being processed by any EFTPOS terminal as long as that taxi-specific instrument and the relevant EFTPOS terminals complied with all relevant banking/financial industry protocols, including security protocols.\\" It was found that: \\"Cabcharge‚Äôs refusals were for the purpose of preventing Travel Tab/MPos from processing Cabcharge instruments electronically and resulted in Cabcharge‚Äôs payment processing system remaining the only system that processed Cabcharge‚Äôs instruments electronically.\\" =Predatory pricing= Between September 2004 and October 2007 Cabcharge acquired taximeters at a cost of $250 per meter. Of these, Cabcharge supplied approximately 727 units free of charge and approximately 5613 units at an invoiced price of $100 (of which it did not obtain any payment for approximately 758 units). At the time its competitors sold meters for between $430‚Äì550 plus GST. Cabcharge installed 197 meters free of charge at an estimated cost of $120 to $160 per installation. From 9 November 2007, it sold meters at a retail price of $250. In addition, Cabcharge supplied meter updates free to networks and operators, notwithstanding that it incurred costs of around $75,000 to supply these updates. At the time its competitors charged $70 to $110 plus GST per update. Cabcharge funded its losses from profits it made from its payment processing systems. It was found that Cabcharge took advantage of the substantial degree of power it had in the payment processing market for the purposes of: (1) affecting the profitability of other suppliers of meters and updates; (2) ensuring that other suppliers of meters and updates could not match or be price competitive with Cabcharge; and (3) ensuring that alternative suppliers did not commence supplying electronic processing services.

As there was a political instability in Sri Lanka after the Anuradhapura Era, which lasted more than 500 years, kings didn't take much effort to build up the religious side of the people. So there were no monks with Upasampada and people had no much education about Buddhism. So with the start of Kandyan Kingdom, the monks got Upasampada, and started to teach people the Buddhism. As people didn't know many things, monks (Specially Sangaraja Maha Nahimi) advised the kings to paint the walls of the temples with Jataka Stories so that anyone could understand even he didn't know to read. That's the start of frescoes of the Kandyan Era.  Special features of Kandyan era frescoes  The walls of the Kandyan Era were built by clay which was stuck in between sticks. Then after they used Makulu Meti, a white colored clay, to smooth the walls in temples and palaces as it was only allowed for palaces and temples to built in white color at that time. The frescoes were drawn after dividing the wall of the image house into horizontal rows. After dividing, drawing the whole Jataka Story was started from right to left, then left to right in the next row (Zigzag) in Akhanda Kathana Kramaya [akha·πá·∏ça-kathana-kramaya] or painting the whole story in fresco. To separate different scenes, the artists have drawn a tree, a river, or a house. The pictures of people were drawn in Parshawa Darshi Kramaya [pƒÅr≈õava-dar≈õƒ´-kramaya] , or drawing the faces and legs facing to a side. The background of the frescoes were painted in a dark red color, and flowers like Lotus, Pandanus flowers are used to fill the blanks. These frescoes were drawn in very fine lining.National Institute of Education, Grade 10 Art Syllabus. 2016Flower patterns at Upper Shrine, Budugehinna = Flower patterns = The blanks of the Kandyan Frescoes have been filled with traditional flower patterns. Not only for filling blanks, these patterns have been used to decorate the Udu Viyan (Ceilings). As flowers, mainly lotus flowers are used. Instead of them, Pandanus flowers, Binara flowers, Beraliya flowers, Jasmine flowers have been used. = Paints = Almost all the paints which were used in Kandyan Frescoes were natural. Those were made up from trees, fruits, etc. mixed together with juices or oils. These were made by artists themselves.left  Red color  Sadilingam, Ixora was mixed to get red color. Red color was also taken from red clay and rocks.  Yellow color  Yellow was made from mud limestone. Sometimes it was also made from Clusiaciae juice.  Blue color  Blue color was made from Fabaceae. Sometimes sea sand was heated and mixed with Arrack to make black color.  Green color  This was made from mixing some blue powder with yellow color. Dahamsonda Jathakaya, Kudakatunoruwa Reswehera Rajamaha Viharaya  White color  White color was always taken by Makulu Meti, a white clay.  Golden color  Golden was made by mixing limestone and golden limestone in same amounts. Or else it was made by mixing limestone with milk of CLUSIACEAE, mercury, white lead, Seenakkaran, and Salt.  Black color  Black color was made by mixing charcoal of coconut shells with Dorana Oil. Dahamsonda Jathakaya, Kudakatunoruwa Reswehera Rajamaha Viharaya = Brushes = Brushes was made by the artists themselves. A grass type called Theli was used for this. The hair from the tails of cats and squirrels, hair from downside of deer, horses and stags, beard of cats have been used for this. Even camel hair sometimes. These were tied to a handle and then used. Some popular artists have been offered from golden handles from king. A fresco at Akurassa Godapitiya Rajamaha Viharaya = Plastering = First, if it is in a cave, then it is roughed and then plastered. This plastering was made by clay and hay. Then a layer of white clay is plastered. Then after clothes were pasted and then started to paint. = Dividing the wall = The wall was divided into horizontal rows in Kandyan Era Frescoes. A small space was left between two rows to write the story. Sometimes it was written in the fresco in a rectangle. The height of the row varies from 30\\" to 40\\" range in low country, while some upcountry temples have range of 5\\"‚Äì6\\". Then after the fresco was painted.  Themes  Jataka Stories and Episodes of the Lord Buddha‚Äôs Life have been the major themes of Kandyan Frescoes. Other than them, Suvisi Vivarana or Bodhisattva Gautama getting blessings from 24 Previous Buddhas, Bodhisattva Gautama in Thusitha Heaven, first council of Arahaths, Atamasthana (8 famous Buddhist Religious Places), Solosmasthana (16 famous Stupa and Buddhist Religious Places), Other Bodhisattva, Thousand Buddhas, and History of Sri Lanka and of the Buddhism of Sri Lanka (e.g.: War of Elara and Dutugamunu) have been themed. Actually the religious rise-up made the artists to draw mostly Buddhism Related Frescoes. And those flowers used to fill blanks are Traditional Flower Patterns.left  Regional variations  Sri Subhodharamaya As the whole country was ruled by the Kingdom of Kandy in early times, this influence of the Kandyan Frescoes was distributed in all over the country. But with the start of Portuguese, Dutch, and British Eras, the European Arts influenced the Kandyan Frescoes. As Portuguese and Dutch only ruled coastal areas, this influence can be seen very largely in coastal areas than upcountry areas. According to these changes Kandyan Frescoes can be divided into two as, # Up Country Kandyan Era Frescoes # Low Country Kandyan Era Frescoes = Temples which contain up country Kandyan era frescoes = # Temple of the Tooth # Degaldoruwa Temple # Madawala Tampita Viharaya # Gangarama Temple ‚Äì Kandy # Ridi Temple ‚Äì Kurunegala # Suriyagoda Temple # Theldeniya Bambaragala Viharaya # Nilagama Thissamaharama Rajamaha Viharaya # Yapahuwa Rajamaha Viharaya # Gampola Lankathilaka Viharaya # Mahanuwara Gangaramaya # Matale Dambawa Rajamaha Viaharaya # Dehipagoda Agrabodhi Viharaya # Makulugaswewa Budugehinna Viharaya # Kundsale Viharaya # Isurumuni Rajamaha Viharaya # Dodanthale Viharaya A low country Kandyan Era frescoare some temples with Up Country Kandyan Era Frescoes. These frescoes are very simple and anyone can easily understand the story. But there are Minor European Influences. For an example, the 'Demons' of the fresco of Mara Parajaya are holding European Guns. = Temples which contain low country Kandyan era frescoes = # Kathaluwa Viharaya # Subodharamaya ‚Äì Karagampitiya, Dehiwala # Mulkirigala Temple # Walalgoda Temple # Samudragiri Temple # Kadolgalla Subdraramaya # Pathgama Rahularamaya # Kosgoda Ganegodalle Viharaya # Thotagamuwa Subadraramaya # Welihnida Sudarshanaramaya # Ambalangoda Sunandaramaya # Thelwaththe Aluth Pansala # South Kaluthara Duwe Pansala # Mihiripanne Ariyakara Viharaya # Hikkaduwe Jananandaramaya # Koggala Dewala Building # North Payagala Ethagama Sumananramaya # Bambarande Kurumbure Viharaya # Matara Walgama Kotikagoda Viharaya A fresco at Muruthawela Sri Narendrarama Viharaya These are very complex and a bit hard to understand. Here there are many European influences. For an example, these frescoes contain ladies who wearing frocks and gentlemen who are wearing trousers, Western style houses, etc. Sri Subodharamaya  Artists of Kandyan era  It is believed that there were many artists in Kandyan Era. The variations of the style, not from temple to temple, but sometimes in the same temple. Artists who painted the marvelous Kandyan Frescoes are not much popular. Instead of their names, their clans were popular. The more refined, detailed drawings with fine lines are often the work of the artists of 'Central School'. They received the direct patronage of the king. The simpler, less sophisticated drawings with thicker lines are often work of 'Provincial Schools' maintained by regional leaders and villagers. = Respect and patronage of the kings to an artist at Kandyan era = An artist was a person who was well respected in the society at Kandyan era. Kings also gave their patronage to artists. There is a folk story about an artist in Kandyan Era. > \\"One day, Devaragampola Silvath Thana, the chief artist who worked in > Dambulla Renovations was on the scaffolding, painting. Not able to go out to > split out wad of betel he was chewing as he worked, he called out his > henchman and handed it down to be thrown away. Then that person threw it out > and came back, asked from the artist 'How long have you been up there to > have chewed such a lot of betel?'. The artist tilted the flame and peered > down as the voice was not that of his attending henchman. It was the > king...\\"A Folk Tale from Sri Lanka This story shows how much the king respected artists at that time. So the respect of the society is clear.

In some temples, photographing these frescoes without permission have been prohibited. It seems that renovation, new construction and over painting, rather than conservation and preservation were the Sri Lankan Tradition. It still is, expect where Archaeological Department of Sri Lanka has stepped in. The present day paintings at Dambulla Temple, have been done over about 2000 year old frescoes of Anuradhapura Era, in the 18th century. Now only a small piece of Anuradhapura Era Frescoes can be seen. But thanks to the archaeological department, conservation of these frescoes are up to a certain level.

She was the first Lord Mayor of Darwin, Northern Territory from 1975 to 1980. She is best known for her work following the destruction of Darwin due to Cyclone Tracy.  Early life  Stack was born in Sydney in 1929, the daughter of William and Elizabeth Stack. She attended Brigidine Convent in Randwick and went on to study piano at the Conservatorium of Music in Sydney Stack married Thomas (Tom) Lawler, an agricultural scientist, in 1957. They have three sons.  Medical career  Stack graduated with a Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery from the University of Sydney in 1956. She then became a Fellow of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners and worked in obstetrics and gynaecology. She worked in Wee Waa and Narrabri in the Namoi Valley before moving to Darwin in 1961. Working at a clinic in Parap, she was one of only two private practitioners in Darwin at the time. After her time as Lord Mayor of Darwin, she completed a Masters of Public Health from the University of Sydney. She then returned to Darwin, becoming the first Assistant Secretary of the Division of Aboriginal Health at the Department of Health of the Northern Territory. She became the Chief Medical Officer of the Northern Territory in 1987. Stack was instrumental in the establishment of Menzies School of Health in 1985. Stack wrote about and commented publicly on public health and community issues such as abortion and women rights.  Cyclone Tracy and life in Darwin  After moving to Darwin in 1961, Stack became increasingly interested in politics. She was elected to the Darwin City Council in 1969 and became Deputy Mayor in 1974. Stack and her family survived Cyclone Tracy, despite the destruction of their house. Stack decided not to evacuate Darwin, instead running an emergency clinic at Darwin High School, which became the main shelter and evacuation centre after the cyclone. She was responsible for the health care of 11,000 people who passed through the centre. \\"Not only did I look after the people that came in, but also people came and lived here,\\" she said. \\"They brought their sodden old mattresses with them... I used to do a ward round every day and call them the sodden mattress lot.\\" Stack was pivotal in establishing the Darwin Disaster Welfare Council, that would later become the Northern Territory Women's Advisory Council. Stack became involved in reconstruction efforts. She was elected mayor in May 1975 and automatically became a Member of the Darwin Reconstruction Commission. Stack was re-elected Mayor of Darwin on 30 April 1978. Stack became the first Lord Mayor of Darwin in 1979 when it became a capital city. She was the first female Lord Mayor of an Australian capital city. Stack was made Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1979 for services rendered to the people of Darwin following the cyclone. Stack resigned as Lord Mayor in May 1980 to run for the Country Liberal Party as candidate in the seat of Fannie Bay in the June election. She lost to the incumbent, Pam O'Neil. In 1985, Stack served as the Northern Territory representative on the first National Australia Day Council.

HM Ship Tiger Taking the Schakerloo in the Harbour of Cadiz, 23 February 1674 Both Schellinks brothers visited Italy. Willem Schellinks was in Rome in 1664.

They are almost all based on works by his elder brother Willem. Dani√´l's profession was a silk trader and he was only an amateur artist. It is believed that many of his works have been wrongly attributed to other artists. Dani√´l and his brother Willem form part of the Dutch landscape and genre artists active in the 16th and 17th centuries who depicted Italian scenes, either real or imaginary. They are referred to as the 'Italianates'.Sheila D. Muller, Dutch Art: An Encyclopedia, Routledge, 4 July 2013, p. 401 They were influenced by Italian models and attempted to capture the Mediterranean light through a colourful style of painting with delicate atmospheric effects. While a number of the Italianates visited and even worked in Italy, some never did but relied for their Italianate scenes on the works of artists who had in fact been there and had brought the Italianate style to their native country upon their return. The Dutch architectural painter Jan van der Heyden, for instance, likely never visited Italy but is believed to have used some of Dani√´l Schellinks' drawings for his Italianate paintings.Peter C.

The production of the Type 512 started in the late 1950s. The radar operates as a surface search and navigational radar on board naval vessel. Produced by the State Factory N. 720 in Nanjing. It was the only naval radar produced by China at the time. Type 512 radar is mainly installed on small vessels such as torpedo boats, missile boats, or gunboats, and some Chinese naval auxiliaries. The 80-kW radar operates at S-band and has an effective range of 20km. Type 512 has been replaced on the 1980s for more advanced radars, after more than three decades of service in the Chinese navy.

Type 382 radar program had already begun in the early 1990s, before the start of the negotiation of importing Russian Sovremennyy-class destroyer in 1994. Type 382 is designed to be a successor of earlier Type 381, but development had run into technological bottleneck for the next generation passive phased array radar due to the technical and industrial limitations in the early and mid-1990s China had at the time. The import of Russian MR-710 radar had provided a significant boost in the development of Type 382 radar in that designers of Type 382 can borrow ideas of MR-710, and as a result, Type 382 has become a cross between Type 381 and MR-710. L Chinese designers abandoned the development of passive phased array radar and decided to adopt the planar array of MR-710 with the same back-to- back configuration of MR-710, because Chinese industry at the time could not provide a new generation passive phased array with the reliability and performance level required by Chinese navy. The more matured planar array of MR-710 not only provided better reliability, but also proved to be more capable than the domestic Chinese passive phased array designed in the mid-1990s. However, Chinese passive phased array Type 381 does have its advantage over its Russian counterpart in that the equipment below deck is far more compact and reliable. Type 382 design was hence altered to combine the best of two systems by integrating the planar array of MR-710 above the deck and the electronic cabinets and operator consoles of Type 381 below deck together. As a result, the original more than 20 cabinets of MR-710 is drastically reduced on the Type 382. However, the most significant difference between MR-710 and Type 382 is that the former is only a single band radar operates at E-band, while the latter is a dual band radar operates at two frequency bands: S (E/F) and C (G/H) bands. Hence Type 382 also has a name: Sea Eagle (Hai-Ying, Êµ∑Èπ∞) S/C, named after the frequency bands it operates at. Maximum power of Type 382 is increased to 100 kW from the 90 kW of the original MR-710., while the maximum range against a fighter sized target is increased to 250 km from the original 230 km of MR-710. In addition to stronger power and higher precision, the rotation rate of Type 382 is increased from the original 12/min to nearly 30/min and scan rate is also nearly doubled.

History  MR-331 Mineral-ME radar system consists of Mineral-ME1 active radar and Mineral-ME2 passive radar mounted in a back-to- back configuration, and Mineral-ME3 mutual data exchange, navigation and joint combat operation control station, Mineral-ME radar system is designed to detect, track and record (including over-the-horizon) surface targets, provide and receive information to and from other sources. Typical detection range against a destroyer sized target in the active mode in up to 250 km, while that of the passive mode ranges from 80 to 450 km. Active and passive subsystems of MR-331 Mineral-ME can operate in conjunction. MR-331 Mineral-ME is installed on Sovremennyy-class destroyer sold to China, and China also purchased additional sets for its own destroyers. China was thoroughly impressed by the performance of Russian MR-331 Mineral-ME naval radar and proceeded to develop its own version designated as Type 366. The major Chinese modification of the Russian system is in the data exchange and operator console, where China has improved mode of operations. Like its Russian predecessor, Type 366 radar operates in five different frequency bands and when working in the active mode, the number of targets can be handled is three times of that of when in passive mode. Type 366 radar is claimed to be superior than its Russian predecessor is when active and passive subsystems work in conjunction. In comparison to the original surface search function of its Russian predecessor, China expanded the functions on Type 366 radar by also using it as a low-altitude 2-D air search radar against sea-skimming anti-shipping missiles. With improved software, Type 366 radar is proven to be effective against sea-skimming target with radar cross section of 0.1 to 1 square meter by detecting such incoming targets at distance of 20 to 35 km range.

In addition to CIWS, Some models of Type 349 is also used to control larger caliber guns. Type 349 radar is frequently but erroneously referred by many as either Type 347 or Type 348, because externally, all three radars look very similar, and all three are developed as fire control radar for small caliber guns. In reality, the three radars are different and they can be easily distinguished by the following features: When electro-optics (EO) are integrated with radar, EO is installed on the portside of Type 347 radar antenna, but for Type 348 and Type 349, EO is installed on the starboard side of the radar antenna. Furthermore, when incorporated as part of CIWS, Type 349 is slaved to Type 730 CIWS gun and thus does not rotate, because the gun rotates when searching/tracking. In contrast, Type 348 is not slaved to the Type 76 37mm twin guns, but instead, installed separately from the gun mounts, and thus Type 348 rotates when searching/tracking. The shape of antenna is also an important visual cue to distinguish three radars. The tip of Type 349 radar is a conical, which is missing on Type 347. Instead, the tip of Type 347 radar antenna is a small circular flat surface, missing the tip of the cone. The antenna of Type 348 radar differs from both Type 347 and Type 349 radars in that most of the cone is missing, only the base remains, so the antenna of Type 348 radar has a very large circular flat surface, resulting in Type 348 radar resembles a scaled down version of another larger fire control radar for larger caliber guns (76 mm or greater), Type 344. Several models of Type 349 radars have been deployed by PLAN, with the first and most widely used version as the one installed on Type 730 CIWS. Another model used to control larger caliber guns is installed separately from the gun mount and rotates when searching/tracking. A derivative LR66 can control both the small and larger caliber guns.

He is Emeritus Professor and Senior Honorary Research Fellow in Roman Archaeology and History at the University of Western Australia. Biography David Kennedy completed a Bachelor of Arts (BA (Hons)) in Ancient History and Archaeology at the University of Manchester in 1974, and was awarded a Doctor of Philosophy (D.Phil) by the University of Oxford in 1980. He taught at the University of Sheffield (1976-1989) and Boston University (1989‚Äì90) before taking up a position at the University of Western Australia in 1990, ultimately as a Winthrop Professor. He retired in October 2017, returned part-time on a research grant in 2018 and retired again in January 2020. He has been a Tweedie Exploration Fellow (1976-7), a Cotton Fellow (2004-5), a Member (1986-7 and 2004) and Visitor (2005, 2012 and 2017) at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, a Stanley J Seager Fellow at Princeton University (2005-6 and 2013) and Visiting Fellow at Brasenose College, University of Oxford (2013). In 1986-87 he held a Senior Fulbright Travel Scholarship (UK to USA) a University of Western Australia 75th Anniversary Award in 1993. He is a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London (1985- ) and of the Australian Academy of the Humanities (1995- ). In 2002 Kennedy was awarded a Centenary Medal by the Australian Federal Government \\"for services to ... archaeology\\". He is Chair of the Roman Archaeology Group (RAG), Perth, established in 2004 to promote interest in Roman Archaeology. Scholarship David Kennedy‚Äôs research focus is on the Roman Near East, with an emphasis on Jordan. His interests encapsulate Roman landscape studies, military studies, as well as Roman infrastructure in the Near East. Kennedy established (1978) and directed (until 2018) the Aerial Photographic Archive for Archaeology in the Middle East (APAAME), a project designed to investigate, document and photograph archaeological sites throughout this region using remote sensing.APAAME website This includes historical imagery and mapping, satellite imagery and aerial photography. The project is designed both to develop a methodology suited to the region and to illuminate settlement history in the Near East. Between 1997 and 2018 Kennedy conducted annual aerial reconnaissance over Jordan - the Aerial Archaeology in Jordan (AAJ) project, as part of the Aerial Archaeology in Jordan project. the first - and until recently, only such programme in the Middle East. The project digitises and makes use of international collections, as well as increasing availability of satellite imagery through programs such as Google Earth and Bing in order to conduct wider surveys of the region. A brief video made by Google for its 'Search' series David Kennedy: Ancient Ruins has been published on YouTube which explains the development of this process. For two years from January 2018 to 2020 he was Director of the Aerial Archaeology in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (AlUla) (AAKSAU) and Aerial Archaeology in Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (Khaybar) (AAKSAK) projects. His other projects have included the Jarash Hinterland Survey with Fiona Baker (2005-2011), a rescue project at the Classical city of Zeugma on the Euphrates (1993-2001) and currently the Aerial Photographic Archive for Archaeology in the Middle East. David Kennedy's work on aerial photography and satellite surveys has also resulted in part of his research being directed towards more ancient archaeological remains in the Near East, such as Desert Kites. Kennedy has been working on making research more accessible by publishing in iBook format, the first of which is the Kites in Arabia ibook which was made available on iTunes.Kites in ‚ÄòArabia‚Äô. iBook (2014) (with R. Banks and P. Houghton). See also http://www.apaame.org/2014/09/publications-kites-in-arabia-ibook.html In February 2016 an article titled 93-Mile-Long Ancient Wall in Jordan Puzzles Archaeologists was published on LiveScience which showcases some of the recent activity in this research area undertaken by David Kennedy and his team.

Built in 1840, it is one of the state's little-altered examples of a period town hall building, retaining a number of distinctive features, including benches for sex-segregated seating. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. Description and history The Wayne Town House stands near the center of the rural community, on the north side of SR 133 a short way west of Pond Road. It is a modest single-story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof, clapboarded exterior, and granite foundation. Its modest Greek Revival touches are limited to the door surround, which has wide molding topped by blocks. The main facade is symmetrical, with the entrance flanked by twelve-over-eight sash windows, with a third in the gable above. The interior has a single large open space, its original plaster walls covered in wallboard, and original wooden plank benches lining the two side walls. These are set at a raised elevation above the center, resulting in stepped bleacher-style seating. with The town house was built in 1840 by Peter Fifield for $350.25, and was the town's first purpose-built meeting house, its earlier town meetings having taken place in other private facilities. Of Maine's surviving municipal buildings of this period, it is one of the ones with a very small number alterations. The survival of its benches is of particular note: men sit on one side, and women (who originally were not allowed to vote) sat on the other side.

The album chronicles the group's recordings as the Five Torquays, which was a traditional beat band, up to their demo sessions as the Monks in late 1965. It exemplifies a period in the Monks' musical career in which their rebellious avant-garde style was in its primitive stages. Most of the songs on The Early Years 1964-1965 were featured on the band's only studio album Black Monk Time in 1966. The compilation marks the third time that the demos have been released; however, this latest installment includes much more extensive liner notes and rare photographs. Background Formed in 1964 by five American G.I.s, the Monks, originally known as the Five Torquays, began as a conventional rock and roll ensemble which covered the classics of the 1950s American rock scene. Late in the year, the group released an independently recorded single, \\"There She Walks\\", with 500 copies distributed at the Five Torquays' live performances. Compared to the group's later demo sessions and the album Black Monk Time, the record hardly hinted at the experimental songs the band composed as the Monks. With the help of the German management duo Walther Neimann and Karl Remy, the group slowly evolved into the Monks after leaving the army, placing emphasis on rhythm, and innovating unique sound manipulation in the studio. Guitarist Gary Burger said \\"It probably took us a year to get the sound right\\", as he recalled the Monks' demo sessions in September 1965. Music critic Mark Deming described the tracks on The Early Years 1964-1965: \\"the almost psychotic zeal and ferocious energy that set the album's performances on edge aren't quite in evident; this music may stomp and clank, but it doesn't bite, and that's a big difference\\". Another noticeable difference from the songs on Black Monk Time is the altered lyrics on some demos, which, in comparison, are less blunt than the album versions. It also saw keyboardist Larry Clark open with a brief instrumental, reminiscent of a hymn, followed by an introduction by Burger; however, the practice was short- lived. The two tracks \\"Hushie Pushie\\" and \\"Space Age\\" are two tracks from the sessions which did not appear on Black Monk Time, but were featured in the Monks' concerts. The Early Years 1964-1965 was released on April 14, 2009, corresponding with an expanded reissue of Black Monk Time by Light in the Attic Records. It marks the third time that the Monks' September 1965 demo sessions have been released, with the others being Five Upstart Americans and Demo Tapes 1965. Deming labels the album as an \\"aural document of the Monks as they were trying to sort out the proportions of their singular approach\\". Each album includes a detailed 36-page booklet written by Kevin \\"Sipreano\\" Howes and lyrics to each song. In a review for Pitchfork, critic Joe Tangari praised \\"how clearly the band's vision had already crystalized-- the recording is structured something like a musical mass, with little churchy organ interludes from Larry Clark and a bit of banter from Burger\\". Tangari also noted that \\"For a fan, to hear them honing their rhythmic attack is gratifying-- their sound was no accident\\". Commenting on the musical inventiveness of the group, music critic Ken Shane wrote \\"They were punks years before we used the term to describe a genre of music\\". Writer Rob Nay of Exclaim! magazine reported the album \\"conveys a keen sense of the group's antics on tracks such as 'Boys Are Boys' and 'Higgle-Dy-Piggle-Dy', and the package as a whole adds \\"to the mystique of the Monks\\".

Quantico is an American television series created by Joshua Safran and produced by ABC Studios. Priyanka Chopra stars as Alex Parrish, a bright FBI recruit, who after graduating from the FBI Academy, joins the agency and later becomes a prime suspect of a terrorist attack on Grand Central Terminal. The main cast include Priyanka Chopra, Jake McLaughlin, Yasmine Al Massri, Johanna Braddy, Tate Ellington, Graham Rogers, Anabelle Acosta as her fellow recruits, and Josh Hopkins and Aunjanue Ellis as their trainers at the FBI academy, Quantico, Virginia. In the second season, Russell Tovey, Pearl Thusi, and Blair Underwood were added to the main cast following the CIA plot elements. In the third season, Marlee Matlin and Alan Powell were added to the main cast. Main characters =Alex Parrish= Priyanka Chopra Alexandra \\"Alex\\" Parrish (portrayed by Priyanka Chopra), a former top recruit at Quantico as well as a promising FBI agent was considered a prime suspect in the Grand Central Terminal bombing. She was later pardoned after the real mastermind terrorist behind the Grand Central bombing and the Command Center bombing in New York was revealed. After the negative publicity to the FBI stemming from Liam O'Connor's treachery as well as Simon Asher's death at Quantico, Alex is fired by the organization. Two months after the presidential election ended, Alex is approached by CIA director Matthew Keyes, who provides an opportunity for her to join and work for the organization. After working as a CIA analyst for six months, she is given an undercover assignment by the FBI. She is tasked to pose as a CIA recruit at The Farm in order to expose the rogue faction within the agency called the AIC. Months after leaving The Farm, a hostage crisis at the G-20 summit in New York is declared by a terrorist group called the Citizens Liberation Front. Two weeks after the end of the crisis, former President Claire Haas and CIA director Matthew Keyes put forth a covert joint task force, between the CIA and FBI. Alex was reinstated to work as an FBI agent. Shortly after the task force is formed, Clay Haas was assigned as the leader of the group. Alex and the team were tasked to expose a syndicate of eight collaborators that were secretly involved in orchestrating the hostage crisis. After a national scandal involving the resignation of President Claire Haas along with the disbandment of the task force, Alex resorted to a final strategy. She released U.S classified intelligence to the public at the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia, implicating newly inaugurated President Henry Roarke in a deadly conspiracy. As a result of her actions at the Convention, she is branded as a fugitive of the United States. After being issued a Red Notice for her arrest by Interpol, she leaves the country with Ryan Booth on a plane to Thailand in order to evade the authorities. =Liam O'Connor= Josh Hopkins Liam O'Connor (portrayed by Josh Hopkins; season 1), a seasoned FBI agent who had a fling with Miranda Shaw in the past. Years ago, he and Alex's father had graduated from the FBI academy together and one of their first undercover operations in Omaha was a blown sting killing over 200 people. Years later, he worked a sting operation against some militia groups in Chicago. Just before the case went south, ending in a shootout with three confirmed casualties including Drew's fianc√©e and unborn child, he had told Ryan that he would take the blame and that Ryan would be his replacement. However, it was later revealed that Ryan took the blame for the incident, later losing his position within the Bureau. One year prior to the Grand Central bombing, it was revealed that Liam was demoted from his position within the Bureau. However, Miranda pulled strings to allow him to work as an instructor at the Academy. During his time at the Academy, he had a one-night stand with one of the recruits, Alex, on New Year's Eve. Although Miranda discovered the incident, she was shortly dismissed prior to pursuing the misconduct case with Liam. Sometime later Liam was promoted to the position of Assistant Director, replacing Miranda's former role at the Academy. Months after Alex's cohort graduated from Quantico, Liam was assigned to work in a field office based in Washington. After the Grand Central bombing occurred, Alex was considered a main suspect in the case. As a result, he pursued her until she managed to clear her name. Three months after the Command Center bombing occurred, it was revealed that he testified against Elias Harper in the congressional hearing case. Later Miranda discovered that he was the true terrorist behind the two bombings in New York, right before he shot her. It was subsequently revealed that he had used hidden cameras and tracking devices to plan the bombings, and had gathered intelligence to blackmail Elias and frame both Alex and Simon. His objective was to destroy the Bureau before the organization got an opportunity to destroy the country. Initially, he tried to frame Miranda, but Alex and the others discovered his plan to plant a bomb at the FBI Academy, the day the new cohort were graduating. He was unsuccessful; the bomb was later defused by Simon's actions. Prior to that, he was killed by Alex and Ryan. =Ryan Booth= Ryan Booth (portrayed by Jake McLaughlin) is a former Marine and FBI Special Agent. During his time at Quantico, Ryan was undercover as a recruit, tasked to surveil Alex by Liam, but fell in love with her instead. Liam later revealed to him that he was, in fact, in retraining. During this time, he has a relationship with Alex. Afterwards, he takes over Miranda's role as staff counselor. After the Grand Central Terminal bombing, Ryan is working in the New York Office and is in a relationship with Natalie Vasquez and, along with their friends, helps Alex clear her name. However, when Alex persists in investigating when everyone believes Elias Harper was the terrorist, he becomes suspicious of her and is determined to stop her. After his ex-wife, Hannah Wyland, is suspended from active duty after an incident with Senator Haas, Ryan takes over her position under Liam's orders. He finally realizes Alex is innocent and helps the team find the true terrorist, Liam, and he and Alex shoot him. He and Alex reconcile thereafter, but their travel plans are thwarted by Alex's CIA job offer. In the future timeline, he becomes a CIA case officer after completing his training at Camp Peary. At the end of the second season, he is branded as a criminal and leaves the United States in order to evade the authorities. In season 3 he marries Shelby Wyatt (even though he still has feelings for Alex Parrish), as it is revealed in the premiere of the season. In this same episode Ryan tries to save Shelby, who has been kidnapped by The Widow (who will free her if he gives her a code Alex has). =Miranda Shaw= Aunjanue Ellis Miranda Shaw (portrayed by Aunjanue Ellis; seasons 1 & 2), Assistant Director of the FBI Academy at Quantico, director of the training program at Quantico and Alex's mentor.

After the Grand Central Terminal bombing, Miranda is one of the people who believes in Alex's innocence and takes great risks to help her. At the end of the first season, Miranda is named Deputy Director of the FBI. In the future, she is shown to be a representative of the terrorist group, the Citizens Liberation Front. Sometime later, Miranda is incarcerated in a federal prison due to orchestrating what appears to be an attempted murder of Alex Parrish at the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia. =Caleb Haas= Caleb Haas (portrayed by Graham Rogers; season 1, main; 2, guest) was an FBI trainee who originally flunked out of the Academy as an agent, but was brought back to train as an analyst, and then reinstated as an agent-trainee again. He is the son of FBI Deputy Director Clayton Haas and Senator Claire Haas. At 17, he joined a cult called Sistemics but his father pulled him out. During his time at Quantico, he uses the name Mark Raymond in an undercover operation to infiltrate Sistemics, in an operation coordinated with his father to lure out Sistemics' leader and Kentucky bombing suspect Dan Berlin. Prior to the Grand Central Terminal Attack, Caleb was stationed as an analyst in San Diego, but requested a transfer to New York. During the Command Center bombing, his father saved his life before he died when the building fell over him. As a result, Caleb became a drug addict and his mother locked him up at her home so he would not affect her election chances. Caleb left with Alex and he went through withdrawal, with Alex and Shelby's help. He later helped track down the true terrorist, Liam. In the second-season premiere, Shelby mentioned that he resigned from the FBI and commenced study at a law school in UC Berkeley. After the 2018 Hostage crisis ended, it was revealed that Caleb vacated in Tulum, Mexico prior to visiting his mother and brother in Washington, D.C.

The aggressive and secular Nimah desperately wants to be a special agent but is not quite up to the physical and mental challenge, while the more religious Raina is better suited to the role, but only entered training because Nimah wanted it so much. Eventually, they are allowed to be revealed to the NATs. The main physical difference between the two is that Raina wears the hijab and is a devout Muslim and Nimah doesn't and isn't. In the future timeline, Nimah and Raina are working undercover in a terrorist cell. Three months after the second bombing hit, Nimah is working as an agent in the New York branch, and Raina has left the FBI because Nimah reported her for being too emotionally involved with Hamza, whose terrorist cell they were infiltrating prior to the Command Center bombing. Raina initially moved home to Dearborn, Michigan, but later became a high-level diplomatic translator, while Nimah stayed on at the FBI. In the future, Nimah joins the terrorist organization, the Citizens Liberation Front, while Raina becomes the conference interpreter at the 2018 G-20 summit in New York. Shortly after the 2018 Hostage Crisis event, the twin sisters are arrested. Sometime later, they are freed from prison and pardoned for their earlier case arrests. =Shelby Wyatt= Shelby Wyatt (portrayed by Johanna Braddy) is Alex's best friend and an excellent markswoman.

Shelby's parents were supposedly killed on 9/11, when she was 16, leading her to join the FBI to try to stop future terrorist attacks within the United States. Shelby thought she had a half-sister named Samar Hashmi, who she sent money regularly until Caleb found out she was a con artist. Also with Caleb's help, she later learned her parents faked their deaths after unknowingly selling weapons software to the Taliban. Her parents meet her in Canada, but Caleb discovered they were only interested in conning more money from her. Though Caleb tried to protect her from the truth, when she learned it, she contacted Deputy Director Haas to bring them to justice. She had a relationship with Caleb in the Academy, and later, she had an affair with Caleb's father, FBI Deputy Director Clayton Haas, before he was killed in the second bombing. After the scandal, Shelby was no longer considered an FBI agent because her relationship with Clayton was exposed as part of the process of the congressional testimony for the Command Center bombing. She returned to running her family company. After she mended her friendship with Alex, she tried to infiltrate the FBI computer systems, in order to help Alex stop the mastermind terrorist from plotting another bombing.

After being kicked out of the FBI academy, he worked as an IT tech. When Alex is framed for the Grand Central bombing, she reached out to him to help her. Without her knowing, he was a deep cover FBI informant who had to turn her in, as an order from Clayton Haas. However, he believed and helped her, even falling in the hands of the terrorist, who forced him to build an atomic bomb. Drew helped him escape, at the cost of his own life, and Simon managed to get to Alex on time.

References  ","title":"List of Quantico characters"},{"id":"51134555","text":"The Municipal Association of Victoria (MAV) is the legislated peak body for representing the local governments in Victoria.  Aims  The overall purpose of the MAV is to represent the interests of the 79 local governments in Victoria. Its stated roles are to support councils and councillors, provide a platform for advocacy, and promote the role of local government. The organisation also provides services to its member councils. These services include joint procurement, insurance, and policy advice.  History  The Association was created in 1879 to represent the interests of local governments in Victoria. The Municipal Association Act 1907 of the Parliament of Victoria formally recognised the organisation as a peak body, primarily for the purpose of creating the Municipal Officers Fidelity Guarantee Fund. = 1994 council amalgamations = During the amalgamation of local councils in Victoria in the early 1990s, the MAV campaigned against the compulsory competitive tendering introduced for the 78 new councils created after the process, arguing that it had significant impacts on both council employees and residents. Following the amalgamations and return of democratic government in 1996/97, the MAV ran a number of programs to monitor and support councils restructuring in the new process. This included the Step Asset Management Program, which eventually assessed a large number of primarily rural councils as being financially unsustainable. = 2015 Victorian Auditor-General's Report = In February 2015, the Victorian Auditor-General published a report into Local Government Victoria and the MAV on the effectiveness, efficiency and economy of the support provided to councils. It found serious structural and governance deficiencies in the MAV, prompting significant media coverage on its findings. The report questioned many aspects of the organisation's operations, including value for money of its procurement activities and lack of public accountability. The report's conclusions prompted Frankston City Council to leave the MAV in August 2015. It rejoined in August 2017 after a new council resolution was passed. Many other councils expressed similar concerns and considered ceasing their memberships, including the City of Monash, the Shire of Mitchell, and the City of Boroondara. Councillors from the cities of Yarra and Melbourne also expressed concerns over the report. Boroondara later withdrew its representation from the Association after a lengthy and public court battle with the City of Darebin, citing issues presented in the Auditor-General's report. The MAV's initial response to the report disputed some of its key conclusions, including the premise that the MAV could be subject to the direction of the state government. However, following the appointment of a new board in March 2015 and a motion from the State Council in early 2016, independent auditors and consultants through Ernst & Young and Deloitte have been appointed to oversee the implementation of the report's recommendations.  Structure  = Board = The Board of the MAV is made up of councillors from its members‚Äô councils. It consists of 12 members elected by councils in each region and a directly elected president. Elections are conducted once every two years. = State Council = The State Council operates as the governing body of the Association. It is made up of single representatives from all member councils who formulate, debate, and vote on the operations of the MAV. This includes association rules, policies, and strategic planning.  Members  All Victorian local governments are members of the MAV. The City of Frankston withdrew in 2015 but rejoined in August 2017 after a new council resolution was passed.
