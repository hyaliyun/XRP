From 1927 onwards, he was dogmatics professor at the Protestant Faculty of Theology in Paris. (achev√© d'impr., 1932)-1938 quoted in the BNF catalogue quoted in the BNF catalogue As a specialist in Jean Calvin, he authored several books and articles on Reformed dogmatics. thumb  Early life  Auguste Lecerf was born in London on September 18, 1872, to communards anti- clerical and agnostic parents who had sought refuge in England at the end of the Paris Commune in 1871.Calvin and His Influence, 1509-2009, Philip Benedict Pg, 242 At the age of 12, He was religiously awakened in an Evangelical Sunday School in London. Later he converted to Protestantism at age 17 after reading Romans and Calvin's Institutes of the Christian Religion. He was then baptized at 17.The History and Character of Calvinism By J.T. McNeill Page 430 Influence One of the first traces of reformational scholarship [in France] can be found in the writings of Auguste Lecerf. The third chapter of his famous Introduction √† la dogmatique r√©form√©e (Lecerf, 1938) deals with \\"Calvinism and philosophy\\". There the reader may be surprised to discover that long before Dooyeweerd lectured in France, Lecerf (1938: 41) mentions \\"les philosophes r√©form√©s Dooyeweerd et Vollenhoven\\" and shows familiarity with their ideas. Even more surprising is the fact that he discussed the two reformational philosophers before 1938, in a series of scattered articles which were published posthumous with the title Calvinist studies (Lecerf, 1949). Those studies were the object of intense dialogue with the famous French philosopher √âtienne Gilson (1884-1978) who argued with Lecerf from a Roman Catholic point of view, in his Christianity and philosophy (Gilson, 1936). With this, reformational thinking was brought to the attention of the \\"top level\\" philosophers of France.Renato Coletto, Traces of neo-Calvinism in France and Italy. Koers, 75(1):149-172: He was a major influence on two other key French Reformed theologians Pierre-Charles Marcel and Pierre Courthial. It was Lecerf who encouraged Pierre Marcel to study Herman Dooyeweerd.Thomas Reid (2002) 'The heritage of Auguste Lecerf' Evangelical Times (March) In France and French-speaking Switzerland, Auguste Lecerf's teaching and writing succeed in creating a whole new Calvinist movement within Protestantism. With his friend pastor Jacques Pannier, Auguste Lecerf launched the Calvinistic Society of France and he was the first editor of its Bulletin.Bernard Reymond, Le protestantisme et Calvin: que faire d'un a√Øeul si encombrant ? Publisher: Labor et Fides, 2008, 134 pages, , p. 107 He studied at the Faculty of Protestant Theology in Paris. His thesis was on determinism and responsibility in Calvin's system. He was involved in pastoral ministry for almost twenty years in Normandy and for four years was a military chaplain. In 1932 he returned to Paris to become a professor in the Protestant Faculty of Theology, University of Paris. He remained there until his death in 1943. Lecerf was strongly influenced by Jonathan Edwards.Auguste Lecerf, Le determinisme de la responsabilite dans le systeme de Calvin (Paris: Imprmerie Jouve, 1894. The introduction to this work indicates his debt to Edwards He studied under Auguste Sabatier but turned away from that teacher's vague spirituality to write a thesis of his own on entitled: Determinism and Responsibility in Calvin's System, (1895). His subsequent theological work is much influenced by Herman Bavinck and Dutch Neo-Calvinism.Kevin Davis, A Guide to Reformed Systematic Theology Texts (blog) Among his most influential followers are: * French pastor Pierre-Charles Marcel (1910‚Äì1992) who launched in 1950 La Revue R√©form√©e * French pastor Pierre Courthial (1914‚Äì2009), leader of the evangelical wing of the Reformed churches in France, from the evangelical theology seminar of Aix-en-Provence * Andr√© Schlemmer (1890-1973), a French medical doctor with a strong Reformed church involvement, author of several books among which a collection of Auguste Lecerf's writingsAuguste Lecerf, Etudes calvinistes, recueillies et annot√©es par Andr√© Schlemmer, Delachaux et Niestl√©, Neuch√¢tel et Paris, 1949, 148 pages, recension par Emile G.

The Intellec computers were among the first microcomputers ever sold, predating the Altair 8800 by at least two years. Introduction The first series of Intellecs included the Intellec 4 for the 4004, the Intellec 4 Mod 40 for the 4040, the Intellec 8 for the 8008, and the Intellec 8 Mod 80 for the 8080. The Intellec 4 and 8 were introduced at the June 1973 National Computer Conference in the New York Coliseum. The Intellec computers were sold to the general public, and a very limited number were built. The Intellec 8 retailed for $2,395. Features The Intellecs have resident monitors stored in ROMs. They also included an assembler, linker, and debugger, as well as the ability to act as an in-circuit emulator. Additionally, a PL/M compiler, cross-assembler and simulator were available, which allowed writing programs in a higher-level language than assembly. FORTRAN compilers were also available. The Intellec 8 supported a Teletype operating at 110 baud, a high speed punched paper tape readerIntel Microcomputer Peripherals: imm8-90 Intellec 8 High Speed Paper Tape Reader Google Docs. and a CRT terminal at 1200 baud.Intellec 8 Bare Bones 8 and Microcomputer Modules Google Docs. The Intellec 8 is able to address up to 16K of memory and came with 5K pre-installed. The Intellec 4 came with 1K of PROM and 4k of RAM for instruction memory, as well as 320 4-bit words of data memory, expandable to 2560 words. The Intellec 8 ran with a two-phase clock of 800kHz, resulting in an instruction cycle time of 12.5us. The Intellec 4 ran at a slower clock rate of 750kHz, but had a faster instruction cycle time of 10.8us. Both systems were available in \\"Bare Bones\\" editions, which omitted the front panel, power supply, and completed chassis; instead, it is designed to mount into a rack. Both systems also weighed . Usage Intel MCS8 Intellec microcomputer with the cover removed Intel MCS8 Intellec microcomputer showing the rear of the chassis Intel did not market the Intellec as a general-purpose microcomputer, but rather as a development system. As the first microprocessors were intended to run embedded systems such as in calculators, computer terminals and digital watches, the Intellec was used for programming programmable memory chips used by embedded systems, e.g. the 2048-bit (256-byte) Intel 1602A programmable read-only memory (PROM) or erasable 1702A EPROM chips which were plugged into a ZIF socket on the Intellec-8's front panel.Freiberger & Swaine (2000).

His pastoral career was spent in Lyon, La Voulte-sur- Rh√¥ne, and Paris. He helped establish theological study centres in France, and in later life completed two volumes of theological writing.  Early life  Pierre Courthial was born in Saint-Cyr-au-Mont-d'Or, France, August 1914. His father was a businessman and was Protestant; his mother was Catholic. At sixteen, Courthial read works by John Calvin and his colleague, Pierre Viret. These writings established a theological foundation for his studies that continued throughout his lifetime. Temple de Passy-Annonciation, 19 rue Cortambert, Paris XVI  Education  Courthial began studying business, but after only one year he decided to pursue theology. He studied formally at the Protestant Faculty of Theology in Paris from 1932 to 1936, where he learned from Reformed theologian Auguste Lecerf. After completing his studies at the university, he returned to stay with his family until he was awarded a scholarship to begin doctoral work at the Free University of Amsterdam. However, his plans were interrupted when the Protestant Church in Lyon asked him to pastor the church for one year until their new minister was able to arrive. As it turns out, Courthial never continued his studies, but worked as a pastor for much of the rest of his life.  Ministry  alt= During his pastoral ministry, Courthial studied Scripture and Reformed theology. Despite being firmly centered in Reformed doctrine, he strongly upheld ecumenism and found this to be centered on the four grand dogmas of the Church: the dogmas of the Trinity, the Incarnation, salvation by grace, and the authority of Scripture. A year after he became a pastor in Lyon in 1937, he was sent as a delegate to the Synod at Lyon, which decided to reestablish the Reformed Church of France. When in 1941 Courthial was named pastor of a Reformed parish in La Voulte-sur-Rh√¥ne, he befriended an orthodox theologian; the two met often to read and discuss the Church Fathers. It was during this time Courthial learned much about modern orthodox theologians. During his time at L‚Äô√âglise R√©form√©e de l‚ÄôAnnonciation in Paris (1951-74), Courthial continued to study theology diligently, dedicating significant time to sermon preparation, all while caring for his congregation. He served there for twenty-three years. In addition to his pastoral work, Courthial served as co-editor of La Revue r√©form√©e, for which he also contributed articles. He served on several missions and educational boards and in 1967 formed the Center of Evangelical Theological Studies. In the 1970s Courthial expanded his personal studies to translate works from well-known Dutch theologians into English, and he translated the works of many respected Americans as well. Thus began his concentration on the significance of what he called ‚Äútota scriptura‚Äù (he preferred this term to ‚Äúsola scriptura‚Äù), which is the application of God‚Äôs word to every area of life. This eventually led to a line of theology that would come to be known as ‚Äúthe ecumenism of Athanasius‚Äù, which is the application of Scripture to all aspects of life, or the ecumenism of those who live and work ‚Äúagainst the world‚Äù as Athanasius did.  Reformed Seminary at Aix-en-Provence  alt= In 1973, Courthial helped found a faculty of Protestant Reformed theology in Aix-en-Provence. Paul Wells, Eugene Boyer, Pierre Filhol, and Peter Jones all visited him and asked him to join them. He accepted their invitation, moving to Aix-en-Provence, where he served as the first dean at the Free Faculty of Reformed Theology and taught apologetics and practical theology until his retirement in 1984. He lived at 33 Avenue Jules Ferry from 1974 to 1984. William Edgar (now a professor at Westminster Theological Seminary, Philadelphia) and Pierre Berthoud (who succeeded him as dean) also joined the faculty. During these years Courthial traveled to South Africa, the United States, and Canada. In September 1979, he traveled to Philadelphia at the invitation of Westminster Theological Seminary to speak at their 50 year Jubilee, where he was one of four distinguished recipients chosen to receive Westminster‚Äôs first honorary doctorates.  Theological works  After his retirement in 1984 Dr. Courthial applied himself to his two major writing projects, Le jour des petits recommencements (The day of small new beginnings), 1996, and De Bible en Bible (From Bible to Bible), 2001. Courthial undertook the first of these with the encouragement of his good friend in Switzerland, Jean-Marc Berthoud, brother of Pierre Berthoud. Courthial completed Le jour des petits recommencements at the age of 82. Over the course of the next ten years, until his death in 2009, Courthial stayed in contact with friends and theologians from his home in Paris. His theology was strongly influenced by John Calvin, Pierre Viret, August Lecerf, Pierre du Moulin, Blaise Pascal, Abraham Kuyper, John Murray, J. Gresham Machen, Cornelius van Til, Rousas John Rushdoony, Paul Wells and others. Pierre and Helene in D.C. 1966  Death  Pierre Courthial died on April 23, 2009.

The KRA reopened factories which ahd shut down because they were not economically viable. They also promoted the substitution of more readily available materials for scarce materials. One example was the use of the Haber-Bosch process of ammonia production, when the Allied Powers' blockaded the importation of Chilean saltpeter. By 1918 it had 2,500 employees.

She played a vital role in the creation of the Rainbow House in 1977, a child abuse prevention program and crisis nursery, the first of its kind, which paved the way for later organizations such as the Child Abuse Network and the Parent Child Center. She has served as a community leader in race and ethnic relations with the Oklahoma Conference for Community and Justice. In 2007, Creveling was inducted into the Oklahoma Women's Hall of Fame for her volunteer and advocacy work. Early life Ginny Creveling was born in Manila, Philippines to Filipino parents. Her father was in the Filipino Army, and was commissioned on the battlefield into the U.S. Army, which at that time made him a U.S. citizen, making his wife and Creveling's mother also a legal U.S. citizen. All seven of their children also qualified for citizenship, and when they moved to the United States, most of Creveling's childhood was spent at numerous army bases. She was the oldest of seven children and had a large responsibility with the rearing of her younger siblings as a child, as her mother worked. Creveling graduated from Lawton High School in 1964. College was highly encouraged by her parents, so Creveling attended the University of Oklahoma, where she entered a nursing program. A few years later, her mother fell ill, so she returned to California to care for her. Soon after, Creveling was married and moved back to Oklahoma, where she had two children. When they were old enough to be in school, she re-entered a nursing program at the University of Tulsa, taking a class a semester. She earned her nursing degree in 1984, and later went back to school again and earned her MBA in 2000. While Creveling was a stay-at-home mother, she was involved with numerous volunteer organizations, and one of these involvements led to a job. Career Through her volunteer efforts, Creveling was offered a position as PR director at the Westin Hotel, where she worked part-time for approximately eight years. The hotel eventually closed and Creveling was offered a position to head staffing for the National Governors Association meeting held in Tulsa in 1993. After this event, she was offered a job from ONEOK. The company created a position for Creveling in community relations. When the ONEOK Foundation was established in 1997, she was there from the beginning as Executive Director. Community involvement Creveling played a vital role in the creation of Rainbow House, a child abuse prevention program and 24/7 crisis nursery that was the first of its kind. Eventually the program had to be closed due to loss of funding, but was merged with the Children‚Äôs Registry at Hillcrest Medical Center, which then merged with Parents Anonymous, which is now the Parent Child Center. Her early advocacy work with child abuse led to a greater discourse in the community which paved the way for other programs to flourish in Tulsa. Creveling has also played a large part in developing The Oklahoma Center for Community and Justice, a human relations organization dedicated to fighting bias, bigotry and racism and promoting respect and understanding through education and advocacy. Other community groups which Creveling is involved include: *Association of Women in Communications *Funders Roundtable *Tulsa Press Club *Advisory council of Habitat for Humanity *Advisory council for Tulsa Young Professionals *Advisory council for the University of Oklahoma-Tulsa and University of Tulsa College of Business Administration *Board of Directors for the Oklahoma Jazz Hall of Fame *Former president and currently board of directors for the Child Abuse Network *American Heart Association *Big Brothers & Sisters *Domestic Violence Intervention Services *Leadership Oklahoma and Leadership Tulsa *Sister Cities International *Tulsa Ballet Theater *Magic Empire Council of Girl Scouts Awards and recognition *Oklahoma Women's Hall of Fame inductee (2007) *Juliette Low Leadership Award (2006) *Tulsan of the Year from Tulsa People magazine (2005) *Fifty Making a Difference by the Oklahoma Journal Record (2003 and 2005) References External links *Oklahoma Women's Hall of Fame Oral History Project -- OSU Library * Child Abuse Network * Parent Child Center Year of birth missing (living people) Living people American people of Filipino descent People from Tulsa, Oklahoma People from Manila University of Oklahoma alumni University of Tulsa alumni ","title":"Ginny Creveling"},{"id":"47077821","text":"One World is a televised series of in-depth interviews hosted by Deepak Chopra, and directed and executively produced by Martine Dubin.

Branigan (1933 ‚Äì June 27, 1999) was a Canadian politician and medical doctor, best known as a former mayor of Whitehorse, Yukon. As a medical doctor, he was also noted for his frequent legal conflicts with medical licensing bodies opposed to his use of holistic medical practices such as acupuncture. Background Born in Loverna, Saskatchewan, Branigan trained as a medical doctor at the University of Alberta. Practicing as a rural family doctor, he was mayor of the town of Manning, Alberta, a Liberal Party of Canada candidate for Peace River in the 1968 federal election, and a candidate for the leadership of the Alberta Liberal Party in its 1969 leadership race, before moving to Yukon. Move to Whitehorse He later moved to Whitehorse, where he resumed his medical practice. In this period, he began to introduce holistic therapies into his practice, resulting in frequent conflict with the Yukon Medical Council and other authorities. The Whitehorse General Hospital revoked his hospital privileges in 1979; although they denied that the revocation had anything to do with his holistic practices, they did not publicize an alternate reason. In 1985, the council revoked his license to practice medicine, although it was reinstated a month later. In 1988, the medical council charged him with 103 counts of fraud relating to his medical billing practices, although 42 of the charges were withdrawn in the trial phase and he was acquitted of the other 61 charges in 1989. Politics He ran three times for election to the Yukon Territorial Council, losing in the 1970 election to Norman Chamberlist and in the 1974 election to Willard Phelps. He filed a petition against Phelps' election on conflict of interest grounds, which resulted in Phelps' election being voided in 1975. He then ran in the by-election to succeed Phelps, but lost to Walt Lengerke. He served as mayor of Whitehorse from 1979 to 1982, and from 1984 to 1991. As mayor, he was noted for some quirky ideas, such as suggesting that Whitehorse handle its sewage treatment needs by building a large ultrasonic blaster, and having a pyramid built over the council chambers at Whitehorse City Hall as a spiritual conduit, but was also highly regarded for his practical focus on economic development in the Yukon ‚Äî in particular, he frequently called attention to the fact that the territory's wealth of natural resources offered it many opportunities to become more economically self-sufficient by expanding into manufacturing industries. He ran twice in the electoral district of Whitehorse North Centre for the Legislative Assembly of Yukon, as an independent candidate in the 1982 territorial election and as a Yukon Liberal Party candidate in the 1989 territorial election. Federally, he ran as a Liberal candidate for Yukon in the 1972 election, the 1987 by-election resulting from the retirement of Erik Nielsen and the 1993 election, and as an independent candidate in the 1997 election. He did not win any of the elections to the higher offices. Upon his retirement as a medical doctor, he moved to Carcross where he died on June 27, 1999 after a collapsing from a heart attack.

Biography Veƒçtomov first studied piano and cello with his father, cellist/composer Ivan Veƒçtomov (1902‚Äì81), a soloist in the Czech Philharmonic. He continued at Prague Conservatory under the tutelage of his father, and later at the Academy of Performing Arts in Prague alongside and under cellist/pedagogue . He then pursued his graduate studies at Moscow Conservatory under until 1957, and master classes at Accademia Musicale Chigiana under French cellist Andr√© Navarra. In 1951, together with Josef Suk (violin) and Ji≈ô√≠ Hubiƒçka (piano), Veƒçtomov established the concert ensemble Suk Trio. In 1956 he took over from Milo≈° S√°dlo playing cello in the Czech Trio, in which he continued to perform concerts and record until his death 33 years later. He recorded many works on LP and CD as a solo performer, as well as for radio and television broadcasts. He also performed and recorded with his brother, the guitarist Vladim√≠r Veƒçtomov, as Prague String Duo, releasing phonograph recordings on the Supraphon, Panton, and Melodiya labels. In 2015 the Czech music label Uneventful Records released a CD and digital album of Prague String Duo's archive recordings.Prague String Duo, Archive Recordings (Prague: Uneventful Records, 2015). Along with S√°dlo, Veƒçtomov was considered one of Czechoslovakia's leading classical artists, drawing comparisons in the international press to Russian cellist Mstislav Rostropovich, who had been his contemporary at the Moscow Conservatory. Veƒçtomov was best known for his inimitably sweet tone. ‚ÄúAs the concerto develops, it is clear that Veƒçtomov, so august a member of the Czech Trio, was certainly a big enough concerto soloist, but one who does not seek to impose his personality onto the music. Instead he illuminates it from within.‚Äù Of the same recording, Fanfare observed: ‚ÄúI am glad to have discovered Sa≈°a Veƒçtomov‚Äôs playing, for on this evidence he was a world-class artist ‚Ä¶ his aristocratic playing deserves a hearing, and the disc should certainly be of interest to cellists and collectors.\\" left Regarding the unusual combination of cello and guitar in Prague String Duo, Veƒçtomov commented that a piano absorbs some of a cello's gentler shades of tone, which thus become superfluous; that the guitar can respond more sensitively than the harpsichord to the means of expression of the solo cello; and that it can differentiate all tones and produce vibrato and glissando transitions. Moreover, the cello/guitar combination, he said, is more tender, more sensitive, and better integrated than any other, as the two instruments are also much alike in the technical respect. According to the music historian Ludom√≠r ƒåesenek, \\"The 'string duet' combination is much more than a novelty in scoring musical compositions. It constitutes an experiment rooted in the tradition of the technique of music, an endeavor to discover the sources of musical expression, a renaissance of an approach which, while overtaken by the past development, has lost nothing of its aesthetic validity or of the potential to resurrect it and develop it in the modern spirit.\\" As a professor, Veƒçtomov taught at the Academy of Performing Arts in Prague. His pupils included Michaela Fukaƒçov√°, , and . His pedagogical method focused intently on detail, and he was known for his friendly manner. Veƒçtomov played on two instruments, a 1712 Alessandro Gagliano and a 1754 Giovanni Battista Guadagnini. It is said that in his playing technique he had mastered 30 distinctive glissandi. Accolades Veƒçtomov was awarded prizes in 14 international contests, including the 1955 Prague Spring International Music Competition 1st prize. Throughout his career he was particularly associated with the work of Bohuslav Martin≈Ø, whose Cello Concerto No. 2 he interpreted as a world premiere as well as his Variations on a Slovak Folk Song. Veƒçtomov recorded ten of Martin≈Ø's major works and in 1970 was awarded the Grand Prix du Disque for his 1965 Supraphon recording of Cello Concerto No. 2.

The term is sometimes used sincerely to promote men's rights and equal rights. Members of these groups are known as meninists. History The term meninism was used in the early 2000s to describe a male who opposed sexism and supported women's right for equality in society, politics and at work. See also: this link. By the next decade, the term was used on social media to make jokes which mocked and criticised radical feminism. In 2013 the BBC reported that the hashtag #MeninistTwitter was being used on Twitter, first to share jokes about feminism, but later to share more serious difficulties facing modern men. Meaning The true meaning of menism is to advocate for men‚Äôs rights. Correspondingly, the term menists should be a label for the men who speak for the welfare of first sex. The term has partially evolved into a movement promoting awareness of the issues affecting men, opposition to the oppression men face in the 21st century, opposition to feminism, and modern dating. Women can sometimes also identify as meninists. According to Martin Daubney of The Telegraph, some meninists have used the term to discuss serious issues affecting men, such as domestic violence against men; fathers' rights and divorce issues; and disproportionate male prison sentences, suicide rates, and rates of homelessness. According to Radhika Sanghani of The Telegraph, the hashtag is most commonly used on Twitter to mock feminism, but has also been used as a way to draw attention to men's issues, similar to \\"The Red Pill\\" forum on Reddit. Sanghani says that the movement's reaction to feminism is based more on the label than feminism's views. Abigail James writing for Catholic Online said that while meninism raises legitimate issues which should be taken seriously, its heart is based on a misinterpretation of the meaning of feminism. Antifeminism is also associated with the Meninist movement. Usage Mintified, an India-based media website, started the #BlameOneNotAll hashtag to discourage generalisations of men. According to Victoria Richards of The Independent, the campaign was part of the meninist movement. The campaign received backlash for shifting focus away from the victims of rape and implying that basic decency should be rewarded. In an opinion piece for The Economic Times Shephali Bhatt criticised the use of the movement and International Men's Day to sell deodorant, saying \\"...for an initiative to become a social phenomena, it needs to be rooted in truth. And the truth is that [men are] a sufficiently privileged gender, comparatively.\\" James Millar used the phrase in the New Statesman stating that for meninists \\"fighting, cat-calling and barbecuing is basically all [they‚Äôve] got\\". The hashtags have also been used for T-shirts and similar, with self-portraits of people wearing the clothes widely shared on social media. Several outlets reported that the clothes and images were widely mocked, and often Photoshopped sarcastically.

His monument in Westminster Abbey was the first ever to be erected by Parliament at public expense. Early life and career He was born in 1698, the youngest son of Henry Cornewall and his second wife Susanna, and was baptised at Moccas on 17 November 1698. His naval career began as a Volunteer-per-order, serving first upon from March 1721 before transferring to in December of the same year. Three years later he was given his first independent command, being promoted to become captain of the Fifth- rate on 3 April 1724. He spent four years aboard this ship, principally in the waters off Boston, protecting trade and suppressing piracy. John Knox Laughton compares this phase of his life to \\"the opening chapters of Fenimore Cooper's Water Witch and Red Rover.\\" While in Boston, Cornwall drew the ire of provincial authorities for heavy-handedness. When local authorities raised a crew and provincial naval vessel to hunt pirates in the summer of 1726, Cornwall stopped them and fired on the vessel when the provincial sailors refused to stop for him. He returned to England in August 1728, and made an unsuccessful attempt to represent the seat of Weobley on 30 January 1730, losing to John Birch. When Birch was expelled from Parliament due to his involvement in the fraudulent sale of the Derwentwater estates, Cornewall stood again and defeated him on 14 April 1732. In December of that year he was back at sea, this time commanding ,Foljambe and Reade (1908) p.111 names this ship as which he sailed to the coast of Morocco establishing friendly relations with the Barbary pirates of Sal√© and the bashaw of T√©touan. In March 1734 he was back in England, where he unsuccessfully attempted to retain his seat in the General Election of that year, losing once again to John Birch. In June he took command of and served in the English Channel and was part of a fleet commanded by Sir John Norris sent to the Iberian Peninsula to protect Portugal from Spanish attack. Cornewall had sought to overturn the result of the 1734 election on the basis that \\"the right of election [at Weobley] was in the occupiers or owners of certain 'ancient vote-houses' and not in the householders at large.\\" By the time the House came to consider this petition, Birch was no longer alive to defend his side of the argument, resulting in Cornewall once more being appointed to the seat on 3 March 1737. He was not able to spend much time in the House, only recorded as voting twice and speaking once. In early 1737 he was commander of , regulating the trade in slaves and other goods along the West African coast. He was rumoured to have carried a cargo of slaves to Barbados himself, but the Admiralty were unable to find any evidence to support this allegation. In 1739 he was given command of and sent to cruise the waters off the Azores with and prey upon Spanish ships. A plan that would have seen him lead a small flotilla to the China Seas fell through, and instead he was given command of in 1741 and sent to the Mediterranean the following year with Admiral Thomas Mathews. In 1743, still sailing in Mathews' Mediterranean fleet, he took up his final command: . On 11 February 1744 he was next astern of Mathews' flagship, , during the botched Battle of Toulon. Marlborough and Namur bore the brunt of the Spanish fire, with Marlborough losing 43 killed and 120 wounded from its crew of 750 men. Amongst the killed was Cornewall, with both his legs carried away by a chain- shot early in the action, living only long enough \\"to express the agony he was in, by shaking his head at the surgeon.\\" Command passed to his cousin,Technically, his third cousin once removed Frederick Cornewall, who was First Lieutenant aboard the Marlborough, but he too was severely wounded and lost his right arm. Captain Cornewall was buried at sea. News of Cornewall's death was greeted by a public show of grief comparable with that following the loss of Nelson sixty years later, though the man had led a solid but unspectacular naval career. As Horace Walpole later put it, \\"In the present dearth of glory [Cornewall] is canonized, though poor man! he had been tried twice the year before for cowardice.\\" Family Cornewall never married, but he had an Illegitimate son by a Mrs Hannah Southwark of Boston named Thomas Cornewall (d. 1796), to whom he left ¬£4000 in his will. Thomas would follow his father into the Royal Navy and became a Captain himself in 1757. The bulk of James Cornewall's estate was left to his Half-brother Henry Cornewall, with instructions that it should pass to their brother Velters on Henry's death. Memorials In 1747 a monument to Cornewall was commissioned to stand in Westminster Abbey. Designed by Sir Robert Taylor, it was unveiled in 1749 and was the first ever monument to be erected by Parliament at public expense, as well as probably being the earliest representation of Britannia on a monument. It stood at the West end of the nave near the entrance of St George's Chapel. In 1882 the monument was modified to make a doorway into the chapel, and in 1932 it was moved altogether when St George's was made a war memorial chapel. It now stands in the entrance archway to the Abbey's Cloister. An earlier attempt to move the monument to make room for one to Lord Salisbury was dropped after navy objections. A ship named in honour of the Captain was launched in 1761. Frederick Cornewall was its first commander.

It is the active chemical constituent responsible for the medicinal properties of the plant, which have been used for centuries by the Khoisan people of southern Africa to treat diverse health disorders, including fever, diabetes, hypertension, and various blood related diseases.  Biosynthesis  Harpagoside is characterized as an iridoid glycoside, which is a product of the mevalonate pathway present in the metabolism of eukaryotes, archaea and some bacteria. The iridane skeleton found in iridoids is monoterpenoid in origin and contains a cyclopentane ring fused to a six- membered oxygen heterocycle. The iridoid system arises from geraniol, which itself is synthesized from geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP) by geraniol diphosphate synthase (E1). A p450 type enzyme, geraniol 8-hydroxylase (E2), then hydroxylates geraniol at the 8 position to form 8-hydroxygeraniol. The diol then undergoes two oxidation steps catalyzed by 8-hydroxygeraniol dehydrogenase (E3) to form the dialdehyde, 8-oxogeranial. NADPH catalyzed monoterpene cyclase (E4) then forms three possible iridodial isomers. Instead of further oxidation to the iridotrial, which is the branchpoint precursor to secologanin and downstream alkaloids, the keto form equilibrates into a hemiacetal and isomerizes to form 8-epi-iridodial. Carboxylation followed by glycosylation leads to the glycoside. Subsequent decarboxylation and three p450-type oxidations leads to harpagide. Cinnamoyl esterification at the 3-hydroxyl position leads to the natural product harpagoside. Figure 1: Proposed biosynthetic pathway of harpagoside.  Biological activity  Harpagoside is widely used as a folk remedy to treat rheumatic complaints. Subsequent studies have shown that extracts have good- anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities. An assessment of 15 studies on the pharmacology of harpagoside concluded that daily doses of at least 50 mg are effective for treating arthritis. Clinical studies have confirmed an increase in pain relief for 60% of patients with an osteoarthritic hip or knee. Biochemical studies have elucidated the mechanism of action of pure harpagoside, showing that it moderately inhibited cyclooxygenases 1 and 2 of the arachidonic acid pathway ( COX ‚Äì 1/2) and overall nitric oxide production in human blood. COX 1 and 2 are key enzymes of the arachidonic acid pathway and it has been shown that inhibitors of these cyclooxygenases have implications for treating rheumatoid arthritis.

At age twelve he was taught memory drawing at the Moseley Road School of Art. Here under his teacher Mr Wiley, who he refers to as 'Baggy' he learnt the method of not drawing from an object but instead to sit and visualize the subject for some time first before drawing it, which was a method he adhered to for the rest of his life. He continued this technique at the Birmingham School of Art and his talent allowed him to obtain a scholarship at the Royal College of Art. Ball then taught at the Birmingham School of Art, until he became principal at the Stroud Art College. His preferred mediums were printing, painting and wood engraving. He was an Associate of both the Royal Birmingham Society of Artists and the Royal Institute of Engravers in 1943, and became a full Member of the RBSA in 1949. Ball is considered to be the greatest printmaker of his generation. He created etchings and engravings based on the subject matter of life in Birmingham. This included images of industrial life, people at work and portraits. An interest for Ball was, in particular, the image of the labourer prior to the invention of mechanization. This can be seen in his work, The Quarry at Rowley Regis (1939) shows how humans worked as a machine, using all their power to push the laden hopper up the steep hill. After Ball's death in 2008 an exhibition named Family Perspectives was held, showcasing art from five generations of his family, next to his own paintings, engravings and drawings.

He died of his injuries two days later. Thornton, only 22 at the time of his death, was a volunteer with No. 1 Hook and Ladder Company, as were all his fellow firefighters, with the exception of the Chief Engineer. He worked as a teamster, and supported his mother and two sisters. In a profile of Thornton, in the Torontoist, Kevin Plummer remarked that \\"Little is known of Thornton.\\". He described how former firefighter Robert Kirkpatrick, author of Their last alarm, a book about firefighters who lost their lives in the line of duty in Ontario, was shocked to learn that Thornton had been buried in an unmarked grave. Kirkpatrick researched the approximate location of Thornton's grave and firefighters dedicated a monument to him in 2003. Thornton was inside a burning office building near the southeast corner of Church and King streets, where he was hit by falling masonry. Plummer noted that Thornton was brought to the fire hall for treatment by Dr. Walter Telfer, who cleaned his wounds and treated him with a phlebotomy‚Äîbleeding. Plummer reported that, according to The Globe and Mail \\"About two inches square of the skull was driven into the brain,\\". After his phlebotomy Telfer \\"sent him home to recuperate.\\" In June 2015 a recommendation was made to Toronto City Council that when Toronto Fire Services replaced the Sora with another former Canadian Coast Guard vessel, the Cape Hurd, as its second string fireboat, she should be christened the William Thornton in remembrance of him.

Also in the making is a graphic novel collaboration between the project's original creator, Jasmine Aliara, and horror artist Vince Locke. The project features several portraits both commissioned and licensed from fantasy artist Ken Kelly as well as Locke. Origins Lyraka was originally conceived by Jasmine Aliara in 2006, as the result of a lifetime fascination with fantasy creatures and tales. Around that time composer-guitarist Andy DiGelsomina suggested making the project into something resembling a Wagnerian Gesamtkunstwerk, incorporating music, graphic novels, fiction, and ultimately film. As Aliara put together a website and script corresponding to her vision, DiGelsomina began composing music for the soundtrack. Story Aliara's story is based upon a fictional teenager named Neires, who finds a magic guitar buried in his homeland of Errandia. The guitar transmits a siren's call to the ocean's depths (the latter containing the underwater empire of Lyraka), and the story centers around the protagonist's journey there. Other characters are the main antagonist, Lilliput, who tyrannically rules the aforementioned desert land; her vizier Semmonet; Pinador the dragon; Scatherus, a demonic servant of the ocean's abyss; Locke, the head of the underwater empire's palace guards, and the empress of Lyraka, Jasmine.

Originally designed and built for ferrying passengers and vehicles around the Bay of Biscay and Gibraltar, the promise and success of the Sunward would be short- lived. The restriction on English currency and the closing between the borders of Spain and Gibraltar placed a fate on the newly built ship. Ted Arison, an Israeli businessman, contacted Kloster about the possibility of converting the Sunward into a cruise ship in Miami. The Sunward operated as a cruise ship under the newly established Norwegian Caribbean Line. The ship proved to be a success that Norwegian Caribbean Line commissioned newer, larger ships into the fleet, replacing the Sunward. She was sold to Compangnie Generale Transm√©diterran√©enne in 1973, and later on with several companies. In 2004, the former Sunward was sold to Bangladeshi breakers for scrap. The vessel appeared in the 1970 dramatic film, \\"Darker than Amber\\" and the 1989 comedy \\"Going Overboard\\". History In June 1966, Norwegian businessman and owner of Klosters Rederi A/S, Knut Kloster, commissioned a car ferry for cruise- ferry service between Southamptom, Vigo, Lisbon, and Gibraltar under the operation of its new subsidiary Kloster Sunward Ferries. Designed by Copenhagen-based naval architect Tage Wandborg of Knud E. Hansen A/S, the Sunward was constructed as a large, purpose-built passenger-and-car liner that provided a safe and comfortable ride for passengers en route to the Mediterranean via the often-stormy waters of the Bay of Biscay. While she had great success in the first few months in service, it would be proved short- lived. The United Kingdom enacted a law that restricted the currency which U.K. citizens could take out of the country, and Spain‚Äôs General Franco closed the frontier between Spain and Gibraltar, meaning that U.K. tourists couldn‚Äôt get past the border into Spain.Gallagher 2006, p. 9 Later during the autumn season, representatives from Silja Line were interested in a possible purchase of the Sunward, but turned down since it was not an ice class vessel. The Sunward in September 1970 Meanwhile, Ted Arison, owner of the shipping firm T. Arison Company Inc., was in troubled waters after the Nili, a cruise ship, was seized in November 1966 by the Israeli government after its owner, Nili- Somerfin Car Ferries, Ltd., failed to meet mortgage payments. After five days of legal fighting, a frustrated Arison canceled the operations planned for the Nili and Bilu, which left Arison with large numbers of advance bookings without a ship. Arison would later learn the fate of Kloster‚Äôs Sunward, and emerged with the possibility of transforming her into a cruise ship in Miami. Arison contacted Kloster about the decision of having the ship go on three- and four-day cruises to the Bahamas. Both men joined forces the same year to establish a Florida-based cruise operation called Norwegian Caribbean Line. On December 19, 1966, the Sunward sailed from Miami with 540 passengers on the first three- and four- day cruises to be offered year-round by Norwegian Caribbean Line between Miami and the Bahamas. An immediate success, Norwegian Caribbean Line led the way with its introduction of a fleet of sleek, new ‚Äúwhite ships‚Äù: MS Starward (1968), MS Skyward (1969), MS Southward (1971), and MS Sunward II (1971), replacing the original Sunward. The pioneering Sunwardwas sold to the French state-owned Compagnie Generale Transmediterranee (CGTM) in 1972, entering service as the Ile de Beaute the following year. Ile de Beaute was transferred to Soci√©t√© Nationale Maritime Corse M√©diterran√©e (SNCM), but was eventually sold to Eastern Gulf, Inc. due to its small size for the fleet. Eastern Gulf, Inc. renamed the Ile de Beaute as the Grand Flotel converted for hotel use in Sharjah, United Arab Emirates in 1977. In 1979, she was sold to Amar Line, a joint venture between the Monaco-based Vlasov Group and the Saudi entrepreneur Gaith Pharaon. She was renamed Saudi Moon I and entered service between Jeddah and Suez. In 1988, Saudi Moon I was sold to Ocean Quest International of New Orleans, and renamed Ocean Spirit, which she undertook cruises on routes to New Orleans-Cozumel-Belize-Cancun and St. Petersburg-Belize Reef-Cozumel-Roaten-Guanaja. Ocean Quest International eventually chartered the Ocean Spirit to International Shipping Partners in 1990, and was renamed as the Scandinavian Song and placed into service to its subsidiary SeaEscape. SeaEscape returned the Scandinavian Song the following year to its owner so it can be used by Danish Cruise Lines for cruises from San Juan, Puerto Rico, in November. In 1993, Danish Cruise Lines returned the Scandinavian Song back to SeaEscape, which began cruises-to-nowhere and weekly trips on April 16 to Freeport, Bahamas. In December 1993, the Italian company Fratelli Cosulich, and Havanatours went into a joint venture to sail the 300-passenger ship‚Äì‚Äìnow known as the Santiago de Cuba‚Äì- to different Cuban ports, as well as trips to Cozumel and Montego Bay, Jamaica. Cruising of the Santiago de Cuba was not successful as its cabins never filled to full capacity and was operating at a continual loss, thus the joint venture folded within a couple months of operating the ship. Soon she was chartered to Empress Cruises Ltd., which used her for short cruises from Port Klang until 2003, when she was sold to Indian company Jaisu Shipping. In 2004, the aging vessel was finally sold off to the breakers for scrap in Chittagong, Bangladesh.

Background Prior to the 2010 general election, Conservative party leader David Cameron proposed replacing the Human Rights Act with a new \\"British Bill of Rights\\". After forming a coalition with the Liberal Democrats, these plans were shelved and reinstated only after the Conservative party won an overall majority in the 2015 general election. Former Prime Minister David Cameron then vowed to put right what he termed the \\"complete mess\\" of Britain's human rights laws, on the 800th anniversary of the passage of the Magna Carta by the Kingdom of England, one of the predecessor states to the United Kingdom. Tensions have arisen between those on the political right in the UK, and the European Court of Human Rights, over issues such as prisoner voting. Differences from the Human Rights Act Specific details on the specific legislation at this point are unknown, due to sparse information being published as of yet, however, some proposed differences between current legislation and a \\"British Bill of Rights\\", have already been made apparent, due to the way in which the Westminster system operates. Currently, in order to change the text of the European Convention on Human Rights, there must be broad to unanimous agreement between member states of the Council of Europe. With a \\"British Bill of Rights\\", however, rights would be set forth by the UK parliament or by another body directly on its behalf, operating under the principle of parliamentary sovereignty. The ability to alter what constitutes a \\"right\\" would thus ultimately rest with the current parliament of the time. As a result of this difference, the European Convention on Human Rights and the case law of the European Court of Human Rights would no longer be directly enforceable before domestic courts. However, the UK would remain bound under international law by the convention. Moreover, the Convention provides that its provisions are minimum standards, that a member party can enact laws granting rights. Thus, a British Bill of Rights must reflect all the provisions of the ECHR. Ultimately, any person who had exhausted domestic remedy could refer their case to the European Court which has obtained before and since the enactment of the HRA 1998. The proposals for the Bill of Rights appear not to include denunciation of the ECHR, only repeal of the HRA 1998 which incorporated c1-12 and 14 of the ECHR. This would mean that, taking the previous paragraph into account, people in the UK would access their basic ECHR rights via the proposed Bill and the courts' interpretation of the Bill and its relationship to the ECHR. Denunciation would not free the UK from the provisions of the ECHR in that any matter which occurred prior to the date of denunciation would remain within the jurisdiction of the Court of the ECHR as provided by the convention.

It was part of a chain of fortifications that defended Marsaxlokk Bay, which also included six other batteries, the large Saint Lucian Tower, two smaller De Redin towers, four redoubts and three entrenchments. Construction of the battery cost 1109 scudi. The battery originally consisted of a semi-circular gun platform, with a parapet containing eight embrasures. Its gorge had a large rectangular blockhouse protected by a redan. The battery's entrance was located within the redan. It was originally armed with cannons.

It shows the tragic actress √âlisa Rachel F√©lix, better known as Mademoiselle Rachel, at the time one of the most acclaimed actresses in France. The subject is not shown looking at the artist, but glancing anxiously out of the picture with tears in her eyes. The work was probably painted during one of Rachel's tours of London in the 1840s. It appears unfinished, suggesting that it was painted in a single sitting and Rachel did not return to give Etty the opportunity to complete it. Background William Etty was born in 1787, the son of a York baker and miller. He began as an apprentice printer in Hull. On completing his seven-year apprenticeship he moved at the age of 18 to London. Over the following years he became a significant history painter, specialising in nude figures in historical, literary and mythological settings. He was elected a full Royal Academician in 1828, at that time the most prestigious honour available to an artist. Although almost exclusively known for his nude history paintings, he also occasionally painted portraits, despite portraiture at the time being considered a lower art form than history painting. Subject alt=Two young women in elaborate clothing Portrait of Mlle Rachel depicts the French actress √âlisa Rachel F√©lix, commonly known as Mademoiselle Rachel. Rachel was born in 1821 to poor Jewish parents, and in 1838 made her debut in Paris in Pierre Corneille's Horace, a performance described as causing \\"a revolution in public taste\\". She rapidly became one of the most respected actresses in France, and \\"the ornament of every fashionable drawing-room of Paris\\". Although contracted to the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise, she was important enough to the company that she was able to negotiate four months of leave each year, allowing her to perform abroad with other companies. In May 1841 Rachel visited London, giving a series of extremely well regarded performances. Rachel returned to London for further tours in 1842, 1846 and 1847. It is not certain when and how Etty and Rachel met, but it may well have been through his friend William Macready, then the manager of the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. In keeping with the tragic roles in which she then specialised, Rachel is not shown looking at the artist, but glancing anxiously out of the picture with moist eyes. The painting appears to be unfinished, suggesting that it was painted in a single sitting and Etty did not have the opportunity to have Rachel pose again. Despite this, Etty's 1958 biographer Dennis Farr has described it as a work \\"of extreme sensitivity and perception\\". The painting is painted on millboard, and has an oil sketch by Etty of a crouching nude woman on the reverse side. Legacy alt=Woman in elaborate robes Although Etty painted a number of private portraits of his friends and acquaintances, he produced very few publicly exhibited portraits, fewer than 30 of which were shown during his lifetime. Mlle Rachel was not exhibited during his lifetime; it was possibly among the more than 800 paintings from his studio sold after his death. Etty died in November 1849 and soon fell out of fashion; by the late 19th century the values of all his paintings had fallen below their original prices. Mademoiselle Rachel remained a prominent figure in French society, and was the mistress of Alexandre Colonna-Walewski (with whom she had a son), Louis-Napol√©on Bonaparte and Napol√©on Joseph Charles Paul Bonaparte. On her death in early 1858, attempts by newspapers to publish pictures of her on her deathbed led to the introduction of privacy rights into French law, which have remained in place since. The ownership of Mlle Rachel in the years following Etty's death is not recorded. The painting was untitled, and its attribution as a painting of Rachel is based on its similarity to other depictions of her. It was bought by the York Art Gallery in 1961, where it remains. It formed part of a major exhibition of Etty's work in 2011‚Äì12. A pastel drawing also attributed to Etty, showing a much younger Mademoiselle Rachel, entered the collections of Sir Robert Witt (1872‚Äì1952), and on Witt's death was bequeathed to the Courtauld Institute of Art.

Life Harald Metzkes was born and grew up in Bautzen, a long-established mid-sized town in eastern Saxony. His father was a doctor. In 1945 he undertook war service, but he was able to pass his school leaving exams in 1945/46 at the local secondary school, and progress to the study of art. In 1946 he studied watercolor painting under Alfred Herzog. Between 1947 and 1949 he was apprenticed as a stonemason with the Bautzen sculptor Max Rothe. After that, between 1949 and 1953, he studied painting at the Dresden Academy of Fine Arts where his teachers included Wilhelm Lachnit and Rudolf Bergander. From 1953 till 1955 he worked as a freelance artist in Bautzen. Between 1955 and 1958 he was a , studying under Otto Nagel, at the Arts Academy in Berlin. In 1957, with Werner St√∂tzer, along with John and Gertrud Heartfield, he undertook a three-month study trip to China. In 1959 Metzkes settled on the southside of Berlin, moving into a studio-workshop apartment in 1960: he embarked on a career as a free-lance artist, identified in some quarters by the soubriquet \\"The C√©zannist of Prenzlauer Berg\\". The first exhibition devoted to his work took place in Berlin in 1963. 1963 was also the year in which he contributed illustrations for a book by Vladimir Pozner, \\"The enchanted one\\". During the ensuing 27 years he contributed illustrations for a further fifteen books, mostly by high-profile authors, including Marino Moretti, William Heinesen, Pier Paolo Pasolini, Franz F√ºhmann, Christa Wolf, Hermann Bang, August Strindberg and even Theodor Fontane.

The Thapsos Culture was the subject of great interest of scholars like Paolo Orsi and Luigi Bernab√≤ Brea. The research of Voza have confirmed the existence of three evolutionary phases: * Thapsos I prior to Pantalica Culture, * Thapsos II coeval to the latter, * Thapsos III until the end of the Bronze Age. The type of burial found in the necropolis is characterized by large rock-cut chamber tombs and often of tholos-type that some scholars believe it to be of derivation Mycenaean, while others derive it from the shape of the hut. The housing, in small number, are made up of mostly circular huts bounded by stone walls. Some huts have also rectangular shape. The economy was based on farming, herding, hunting and fishing. There are numerous evidences of trading, in particular of bronze vessels and weapons of Mycenaean production. They have established close relationships with the Milazzo Culture of Aeolian Islands and with Apennine culture of the mainland Italy.

In 1914, he was diagnosed with tuberculosis and had to be hospitalized. The following year, he returned home and, in 1916, collaborated on producing the humorous weekly newspaper Miau!, which not only included contributions from his old friends in Paris, now also returned to Portugal, but attracted art work from Steinlen, Lucien M√©tivet, Paul Iribe, Francisque Poulbot, Bagaria, Olaf Gulbransson and others outside Portugal as well. He also served as Editor for several long-forgotten humorous journals. He succumbed to his illness in 1923, after moving to the countryside in search of a better climate.

Red arrow shows material entering the mill. Blue arrows show compressed air entering and circulating in the mill. Green arrow shows small particles leaving mill. A jet mill grinds materials by using a high speed jet of compressed air or inert gas to impact particles into each other. Jet mills can be designed to output particles below a certain size while continuing to mill particles above that size, resulting in a narrow size distribution of the resulting product. Particles leaving the mill can be separated from the gas stream by cyclonic separation. Particle size A jet mill consists of a short cylinder, meaning the cylinder's height is less than its diameter. Compressed gas is forced into the mill through nozzles tangent to the cylinder wall, creating a vortex. The gas leaves the mill through a tube along the axis of the cylinder. Solid particles in the mill are subject to two competing forces: # Centrifugal force created by the particles traveling in circles # Centripetal force created by the drag from the gas as it flows from the nozzles along the wall to the outlet in the center of the mill streamlines, drag force Fd and force by gravity or centrifugal force Fg. Fd points toward the center of the mill, and Fg points to the wall. The drag on small particles is less than large particles, according to the formula derived from Stokes' law, :V = frac{2}{9}frac{left(rho_p - rho_fright)}{mu} g, R^2, where V is the flow settling velocity (m/s) (vertically downwards if œÅp > œÅf, upwards if œÅp < œÅf ), g is the gravitational acceleration (m/s2), œÅp is the mass density of the particles (kg/m3), œÅf is the mass density of the fluid (kg/m3), Œº is the dynamic viscosity (kg /m*s), and R is the radius of the spherical particle (m). The formula shows that particles will be pulled toward the wall of the mill according to the square of their radius or diameter. Large particles will continue the comminution process, until they are small enough to stay in the center of the mill where the discharge port is located.

Often these methods are applied in the field of palaeobiology to gain a deeper understanding of fossilized footprints.  Neoichnological Methods  Experimental setup for a neoichnological study working with living animals  Working with Living Animals  Typically, when working with living animals, a race track is prepared and covered with a substrate, which allows for the production of footprints, i.e. sand of varying moisture content, clay or mud. After preparation, the animal is lured or shooed over the race track. This results in the production of numerous footprints that constitute a complete track. In some cases the animal is filmed during track production in order to subsequently study the impact of the animal‚Äôs velocity or its behavior on the produced track. This poses an important advantage of working with living animals: changes in speed or direction, resting, slippage or moments of fright become visible in the produced tracks. After track production and prior to reuse, the track can be photographed, drawn or molded. Changes in the experimental setup are possible throughout the experiment, i. e. regulation of the moisture content of the substrate. As an alternative, also tracks of free living animals can be studied in nature (i.e. nearby lakes) and without any special experimental setup. However, without the standardized environment of the lab, matching the tracks with the behavior of the animal during track production is undoubtedly harder.  Working with Foot Models or Severed Limbs  Another field of methods is the experimental work done with foot models or severed limbs.Milan, J., & Bromley, R. (2006). True tracks, undertracks and eroded tracks, experimental work with tetrapod tracks in laboratory and field. Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology ( 231), S. 253-264. With these methods, the natural behavior of the animal is excluded from the analysis. In a typical experimental setup, the prepared foot is pressed into the substrate of interest, which again allows for the production of a footprint. Other than in the methods previously mentioned, the experimenter has now the opportunity to regulate manually the pressure, direction and speed of foot touchdown. Because of that, the effects of those manipulations can be studied more directly. The layering of differently colored substrates furthermore allows to study the consequences of touchdown in lower substrate layers.

Arising from the efforts to fill the female leads of a yet-to-be-made theatrical film titled Moving Still, this behind-the-scenes documentary tracks the deliberations and creative process of casting. It includes footage taken from the auditions of 350 actresses in Berlin, Boston, Chicago, London and Los Angeles that depict the attempts of a director to find performers for three characters and the struggle of the actors to win roles in his film. The film is directed by Barry Hershey and produced by Lewis Wheeler. Synopsis 350 professional actresses responding to calls from casting directors in five cities present themselves for three major roles in a dramatic film to be set in the late 1940s. They converse with the film‚Äôs writer/director about their background, training, professional experience and skills. They then perform prepared pieces from established works, followed by their presentation of the character in readings from the script of the project, all the while guided and evaluated by the director. Before the project was placed on hold, the casting footage was intended to be integrated into the theatrical film itself as a reflection of its themes of fiction overlapping reality, voyeurism and intimacy.  Critical Reception Matt Zoller Seitz of The New York Times wrote: Casting About is \\"A solid documentary about how art is made...\\". Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times called it \\"A fascinating and surprisingly involving film... remarkable... made with awe and admiration, a tribute to people whose life work is as much a calling as a career.\\" Gerald Peary of The Boston Phoenix wrote \\"...this lovely, almost embarrassingly intimate documentary... What raw, exposed moments! The tryouts reveal so much!\\" Richard Kuipers of Variety considered that: ‚ÄúThe acting process is joyously celebrated in Casting About, a captivating documentary... that pays uplifting tribute to acting traditions and female spirit in equal measure.‚Äù Ty Burr of The Boston Globe wrote: \\"Still, the film's a striking piece of work that, in the end, is just an inspired stunt.\\" Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter described the film as \\"A simultaneously dispiriting and inspiring portrait of the auditioning process‚Ä¶\\" review by Frank Scheck, The Hollywood Reporter, June 14, 2007 References External links  *TV Guide http://www.tvguide.com/movies/casting-about/review/287787/ ","title":"Casting About"},{"id":"47079150","text":"Philomena Lynott (22 October 1930 ‚Äì 12 June 2019) was an Irish author and entrepreneur. She was the mother of Thin Lizzy frontman Phil Lynott, and her autobiography, My Boy, documents their relationship. She was the proprietor of the Clifton Grange Hotel in Manchester, which provided accommodation for a number of bands in the 1970s including Thin Lizzy. Biography Philomena Lynott was born on 22 October 1930 as the fourth of nine children to Frank and Sarah Lynott in Dublin, and grew up in the Crumlin district of the city. She left school aged 13 and worked in an elderly people's home. In 1947 Lynott took advantage of a viable job market in England, that needed labour to rebuild damage caused by World War II, finding work as a nurse in Manchester. She began a relationship with Cecil Parris, which led to Philip's birth on 20 August 1949. She suffered prejudice because Philip was illegitimate and mixed race and decided it would be best for him to be raised by her parents in Dublin. Lynott had two other children that she put up for adoption. She remained close to her son throughout his life but because she only saw him sporadically felt they were more like sister and brother or friends instead of a typical mother and son relationship. In 1964 Lynott began a relationship with Dennis Keeley and the couple took over management of the Clifton Grange Hotel in Whalley Range, Manchester. Though they had no experience in running a hotel, they bought the property after six months and remained there for the next 14 years. The hotel became well known in northwest England for being frequented by the show business trade. Lynott took advantage of hotel licensing laws, which meant the bar could be open at 2 am when all other local venues had shut. When Thin Lizzy became commercially successful in the 1970s, the band looked forward to gigging in Manchester as Philomena would accommodate them and put on an after-show party. Guitarist Brian Robertson recalls Philomena insisting on washing his hair before a television appearance, and later said she was \\"like everyone's mum, rolled into one.\\" When the Sex Pistols played Manchester on the Anarchy Tour in December 1976, she was the only hotelier willing to accommodate them. In 1980 Lynott and Keeley moved to Howth, County Dublin, into a house Philip bought for them. They later moved to Glen Corr. She was unaware of her son's history of drug abuse until late 1985, and was present at Philip's bedside when he died on 4 January 1986 in Salisbury General Infirmary. Philomena suffered depression following her son's death and found it hard to come to terms with. She had a difficult relationship with her daughter-in-law, Caroline Crowther, after Philip's death and was forced to apply for a court order to see her grandchildren. Statue of Phil Lynott on Harry Street, Dublin In the early 1990s, Lynott was approached by publishers asking if she would like to write her memoirs. She found the experience of re-examining the relationship with her son difficult, but rewarding. The book My Boy: The Philip Lynott Story was published by Hot Press Books in 1995. She regularly attended rock concerts around Dublin, and continued to commemorate Philip's life. She was a key figure in getting a bronze statue of him made and placed in Dublin in 2005, and was the special guest at Thin Lizzy fan events. Lynott criticised the US Republican Party for using Thin Lizzy's \\"The Boys Are Back in Town\\" as a promotional song. She believed that Republican policies were at odds with the hardship and poverty she had to endure in the 1950s when Philip was young. Lynott died on 12 June 2019, after suffering from cancer for a number of years. The Irish President Michael D. Higgins praised her work campaigning for LGBT rights and against drug use.

The Shames formed in 1964 as the Dimensions. Later they changed their name to the Cryin' Shames, as a comment about the disparaging remarks they would receive about the length of their hair (something to the effect of \\"...what a cryin' shame...\\").

Beckhard and Ewing Scott. The film stars Frances Farmer, John Howard, Roscoe Karns, Robert Cummings, Grant Withers and Samuel S. Hinds. Border flight was based on the exploits of the US Coast Guard pilots, based in San Diego. In Aviation in the Cinema (1985), aviation film historian Stephen Pendo considered Border Flight, a drama that \\"detailed the aerial activities of the United States Coast Guard fighting a gang of smugglers.\\"Pendo 1985, p. 243. Plot Lieutenant Pat Tornell (Grant Withers) and Lieutenant Bob Dixon (Robert Cummings) are sworn into the United States Coast Guard Air Patrol, West Coast division. Pat hates to follow rules, but works with his former rival from school, Lieutenant Dan Conlon (John Howard). Pat starts flirting with Dan's beautiful girlfriend, Anne Blane (Frances Farmer). Former ace pilot Calico Smith (Roscoe Karns), intervenes between Pat and Dan. When Commander Moseley (Samuel S. Hinds) is criticized for having allowed fur smugglers elude the Coast Guard, he sends his men out to bring the smugglers in. Dixon is shot in the attempt, and goes down with his aircraft. The Coast Guard then arms their aircraft with machine guns. During gunnery practise, Pat flies dangerously. Reprimanded by Moseley, who warns both men to end their rivalry, but Pat doesn't listen. On another patrol, Dan is able to shoot down a smuggler's aircraft. On the day that Anne is expected to return from a short trip, Pat as officer of the day, tells Dan that he can leave his post early. The real reason for this gesture is that Pat leaves a welcome home message in the sky to Anne over her ship When Pat buzzes the ship, the captain calla Moseley to complain. Pat's antics finally force to asks for Pat's resignation. Pat quits and begins flying for the smugglers while continuing to pursue Anne, who believes that he is actually working undercover for the Coast Guard. Pat and Anne are kidnapped by the smugglers who take them to their hideout. Anne, whom Dan has taught to use a short-wave radio, manages to get loose from her restraints and calls Dan, alerting him to their location. Dan flies out to rescue her, and Calico follows, determined to help. When Dan arrives, the smugglers are on a boat off the beach, and fire upon him, wounding him in the leg and blowing up his aircraft. Dan tells Pat and Anne to escape in Pat's plane, but Anne vows to stay by Dan, while Pat takes off. Pat realizes that he can still make everyone proud. After sending a farewell message to Anne, he crashes into the smugglers' ship, destroying the ship, the smugglers, his aircraft and himself. Cast *Frances Farmer as Anne Blane *John Howard as Lt.

Governor of Damascus Uthman Pasha was appointed governor of Damascus Eyalet in 1761. He was nominated to this position as a reward for directing the Ottoman imperial authorities to As'ad Pasha's hidden stores of wealth. In addition to the governorship of Damascus, he was appointed beylerbey (governor-general) of the adjacent Tripoli Eyalet and awarded contracts for the districts of Hama and Homs. His rule brought stability to the province and he lowered its inhabitants' taxes. As governor, one of Uthman Pasha's principal goals became bringing an end to the autonomous rule of Zahir al-Umar, who ruled the Galilee (largely part of Sidon Eyalet) and some of its neighboring regions. al-Umar had previously clashed with the al-Azm governors of Damascus and Sidon and when he annexed the port city of Haifa in 1761, Uthman Pasha began making moves against Zahir. Uthman Pasha obtained an order from the Porte to officially annex Haifa to Damascus Eyalet and he dispatched a ship from Beirut with 30 soldiers and a French captain to take the port. Zahir, having had advance notice of this action, had the ship confiscated and its crew arrested.Yazbak, 1998, p. 14Philipp, 2013, p. 39 In 1764, Uthman launched an attack against the Jarrar clan under their sheikh, Muhammad al-Jarrar, attacking their throne village of Sanur and the city of Nablus. Uthman's forces were defeated.Zertal, 2007, p. 240Parkes, 1949, p. 160Patai, 1967, p. 219 Also in 1764, while Uthman was leading the annual Hajj pilgrimage, he had a violent confrontation with Ali Bey al-Kabir, an influential mamluk from Egypt.Gray, 1975, p. 33 When Ali Bey was exiled by the governor of Egypt to Gaza (part of Damascus Eyalet) in 1766, Uthman attempted to drive him out.Crecelius, 1981, p. 80. Uthman managed to have his son, Darwish Pasha, appointed as the governor of Sidon in November 1770 and sometime prior to that, had his other son, Muhammad Pasha, appointed as governor of Tripoli.Philipp, 2013, pp. 39-40. In 1771, Ali Bey, by now the rebellious governor of Egypt, had dispatched an army under commanders Abu al- Dahab and Ismail Bey to subdue Damascus. Together with Zahir, the combined armies of Egypt and Palestine defeated Uthman's army outside of Damascus and Uthman fled north to the city of Homs. The city fell shortly thereafter, although they did not capture the Citadel of Damascus, which was subsequently besieged. However, Abu al-Dahab suddenly withdrew from the area,Holt, 1966, p. 126. citing his fears of violating Islamic principles since seizing an Ottoman province was in effect a direct challenge to the authority of the Ottoman sultan, who held the highest religious honor as the caliph of Islam.Rogan, 2012, p. 51 Removal from office In October 1771, Uthman was removed from governorship of Damascus and also was stripped of his control over the district of Maarrat al-Nu'man. He was succeeded by Muhammad Pasha al-Azm.Gibb, 1954, p. 925. Uthman was transferred to the governorship of Konya and his sons Muhammad Pasha and Darwish Pasha were dismissed from their posts and subsequently assigned to the governorships of Mosul and Karaman, respectively.Joudah, 1987, p. 86. Uthman succeeded in protecting the Hajj caravans for ten years as amir al-hajj and consistently attempted to end the autonomous rule of Zahir al-Umar, and thus his failure to defend Damascus from the Egyptian Mamluk army was the likely reason for his reassignment.Joudah, 1987, p. 87.

After Queen Victoria authorised Dominion and Colonial governments on 31 May 1895 to adopt the Meritorious Service Medal, as well as the Distinguished Conduct Medal and the Army Long Service and Good Conduct Medal, and to award them to their local military forces, the Cape of Good Hope and Natal instituted their own versions of the Meritorious Service Medal.Stephen Stratford Medals site - British Military & Criminal History - 1900 to 1999 - Army MSM (Accessed 20 June 2015) Other territories which took advantage of the authorisation include Canada, India, New South Wales, New Zealand, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria and, from 1901, the Commonwealth of Australia.New Zealand Defence Force ‚Äì New Zealand Long Service and Good Conduct Medals - The New Zealand Meritorious Service Medal (Access date 21 June 2015)Australian Government - It's an Honour - Imperial Awards - Meritorious Service Medal (1902-1975) (Access date 21 June 2015) Union Defence Forces The Union of South Africa was established on 31 May 1910 in terms of the South Africa Act, 1909, enacted by the Parliament of the United Kingdom.

Adoption The Meritorious Service Medal was adopted by the Union as the Meritorious Service Medal (South Africa) in 1914, but unlike the earlier Meritorious Service Medal (Cape of Good Hope) and Meritorious Service Medal (Natal), the name of the country was not inscribed on this medal's reverse. Instead, the South African medal is identical to the United Kingdom's Meritorious Service Medal, but with a ribbon exclusive to South Africa. Award criteria Recipients of the Meritorious Service Medal (South Africa) were usually already holders of a long service and good conduct medal such as the Army Long Service and Good Conduct Medal (Cape of Good Hope), Army Long Service and Good Conduct Medal (Natal) or Permanent Forces of the Empire Beyond the Seas Medal. Until 1920, the award of the medal was coupled to a Meritorious Service Annuity. It could be awarded to selected warrant officers and senior non-commissioned officers of the Permanent Force who had completed twenty-one years of meritorious service. The medal and annuity were awarded sparingly and only to selected candidates, usually upon retirement as a reward for long and valuable service, upon recommendation by their commanding officers and selected from a list by the Commander-in-Chief of the Union Defence Forces, the Governor-General of the Union of South Africa. Gallantry Meritorious Service Medal (United Kingdom), first King George V version During the First World War, as approved by Royal Warrant on 4 October 1916, non-commissioned officers below the rank of Sergeant and men also became eligible for the award of the Meritorious Service Medal, without the annuity, for acts of gallantry in the performance of military duty, not necessarily on active service, or in saving or attempting to save the life of an officer or soldier. For acts of gallantry, however, only the Meritorious Service Medal (United Kingdom) was awarded, irrespective of the recipient's nationality, and recipients were entitled to use the post-nominal letters \\"MSM\\". A Bar to the medal was instituted by Royal Warrant on 23 November 1916, which could be awarded to holders of the Meritorious Service Medal for subsequent acts of gallantry.Australian Government - It's an Honour - Imperial Awards - Meritorious Service Medal (1916-1928) (for non-operational bravery or meritorious service directly connected with the war effort) (Access date 25 June 2015) Order of wear In the order of wear prescribed by the British Central Chancery of the Orders of Knighthood, the Meritorious Service Medal (South Africa) ranks on par with the Meritorious Service Medal (United Kingdom).

Early life  Whitcher was born on March 31, 1815 in Laurens, New York. She was the youngest of four children, with a brother and two sisters. When Whitcher was eleven years old her family moved to the Canterbury Shaker Village in New Hampshire. The site of the Canterbury community was the old homestead of Mary's grandfather, Benjamin Whitcher, who in 1782 dedicated his farm to the Society as a basis and the nucleus for the people of the newly formed Shaker community.  Mid life  Whitcher became officially a part of the Canterbury Shakers in 1826. In time she ultimately became a trustee, family eldress, and schoolteacher of the community. She also served as a kitchen deaconess. According to The Farmer's Monthly Visitor agriculture journal in 1839 Whitcher is 25 years old and a schoolteacher instructing the girls of the Canterbury Shakers. She was a trustee in the Canterbury Society for some 20 years and became recognized as an ideal Shakeress.  Mature life  Whitcher became an active leader in the Ministry of the Shakers. This was composed of two male members and two female members. It presided over the two Societies of Canterbury and Enfield. It was the highest office in the Society.  Death  Whitcher died on January 6, 1890. Her exact age is recorded by The Manifesto published by the Shakers in the obituary section as 74 years, 9 months, and 6 days.  Works  Whitcher often contributed to the Shaker literature with poems. Historian Robinson says she could have been referred to as the Shaker poetess because of her poetic work. Some example titles are \\"The Snow Storm\\", \\"First Morning Thought\\", and this one titled \\"Assurance\\": \\"Who hath a God, hath all the world beside In which to live and move and to abide; But he who trusteth not to power divine, Doth well distrust beyond the scenes of time.\\"  Cookbook  Whitcher was well recognized nationally for her 34-page booklet titled Mary Whitcher's House-Keeper that has a drawing of her on the cover. It promoted Shaker medicines, cooking, and philosophy. Her booklet is the first Shaker cookbook published. It was originally printed in Boston in 1882 and also gives a short history of the Shakers. Whitcher designed a cookbook that had a basic economical meal for each day of the week that was different. This was a novelty for most of the New England homes of the nineteenth century. Many of the recipes she obtained from her friends. She hoped that the readers would use the daily recipes as a basis for more elaborate meals. The first meal was on Sunday and the last on Saturday. After this she gave many miscellaneous recipes including several deserts and credited many to whom she obtained the recipe or desert from. Whitcher brings up some pointers of etiquette for the dinner table at the very end of her cookbook.

Background Governor Scott Walker created the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation to replace the Wisconsin Department of Commerce. WEDC grants loans that would give assistance to a company's attempts to grow and employ more workers within the state of Wisconsin. According to Wisconsin Public Radio, \\"The agency has been plagued by mismanagement and questions about handing out loans without properly vetting recipients.\\" Walker introduced a state budget in February 2015 which removed all elected officials, including himself, from the board. This was revised by the Legislature's budget committee who altered it to only remove the Governor; subsequently, Governor Walker signed the budget in July 2015. In 2020 in response COVID-19 outbreak the WEDC gave out grants for small businesses including an Ethnic Minority small business grant, which they worked with the Wisconsin LGBT Chamber of Commerce to promote, and WEDC representatives said would include LGBTQ owned businesses, however, during vetting for the grant, LGBTQ owned businesses were not considered ethnic minority, so they were not qualified for the grant. Criticism WEDC has received criticism for having poor financial controls. A 2011 legislative audit reported that the organization \\"awarded some grants, loans, and tax credits to ineligible recipients, for ineligible projects, and for amounts that exceeded specified limits.\\" It also reported that WEDC \\"did not consistently perform statutorily required program oversight duties such as monitoring the contractually specified performance of award recipients.\\" In July 2013, WEDC adopted a new policy requiring written reviews on all program awards.

Like this brother, Albert Howell was a right-arm bowler, though he was described as fast-medium rather than fast. He made a few first-class appearances for Warwickshire in 1919 and 1920, but was a fairly regular member of the team in 1921, his best season, when he took 31 wickets at the, for the time, rather high average of 32.61 runs per wicket. The season included his only five-wicket haul, figures of five wickets for 65 runs in the second innings of the match against Middlesex at Lord's. He was not successful in 1922 and did not play for the county after that season. Howell moved to North-East England and between 1926 and 1936 he played in Minor Counties cricket for Durham, at that stage not a first-class county team. At this level of cricket, he was highly effective and in 1929 he was picked for the Minor Counties representative team that met Lancashire in a first-class fixture: the match was ruined by rain and Howell failed to take a wicket, but it was his last first-class cricket appearance.

Gorman (April 9, 1909 ‚Äì July 4, 2005) was the sixth director of the United States Women's Army Corps (WAC) from 1962 to 1966. She was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal for her service during the Cold War. Early life and education Emily C. Gorman was born in New York on April 9, 1909. She was valedictorian of her graduating high school class in Pulaski, New York, and she graduated from Cornell University in 1931. At Cornell, she was a member of the Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority. Gorman also completed graduate work in education and English literature at both Syracuse University and the University of Rochester. She worked as a teacher in New York until she enlisted in the Women's Army Corps in 1942. Gorman graduated from the Women's Army Corps Officer Candidate School in October 1942. After graduating, she was appointed as chief of the School's administration school. In 1944, Gorman was appointed as the staff director for the Women's Army Corps surgeon general in Washington, D.C. Military career World War II and early career In August 1945, Gorman was assigned to Berlin, where she worked as executive security officer of the Allied Control Council. In February 1947, she was demobilized and returned to the states. Soon afterward, she was categorized as active duty and aided in the organization and planning of a new Women's Army Corps center. In 1948, Gorman became a training officer at Camp Lee. Two years later, she was promoted to lieutenant colonel. She served as commander of the basic training battalion until 1951, when she re-joined the Women's Army Corps as staff adviser at Fort Meade. In 1954, Gorman also represented the Women's Army Corps on the Defense Advisory Committee for Women in Washington. Gorman worked as deputy director at Fort Meade until January 1957, when she became deputy chief of the Plans and Training Division at Fort Monroe. Women's Army Corps and Vietnam war Under Secretary of the Army Stephen Ailes cuts the ribbon to open the WAC Exhibit Unit on The Pentagon concourse with Gorman and enlisted members of the newly formed WAC Exhibit Team. In May 1962, President Kennedy received Gorman and the former WAC directors at the White House to publicly celebrate the 20th Anniversary of the Women's Army Corps. Gorman was sworn in as WAC director and promoted to colonel on 1 August 1962 by new secretary of the Army, Cyrus R. Vance. In 1963, she chose Lt. Col. Mary E. Kelly as her deputy director. Gorman enrolled the Women's Army Corps in an exhibit program to increase public awareness of the Corps' functions. The exhibit was unveiled at the Pentagon on May 14, 1963. Gorman had assigned Lt. Col. Mildred I. C. Bailey as the head of the exhibit's planning team. The exhibit, \\"The Women's Army Corps‚ÄìServing with Pride and Dignity,\\" toured the country for six and a half years. In 1963, Gorman approved and enforced a new policy to increase the role of enlisted women in the U.S. Army. The plan included special dispensations for female soldiers based on the demands of currently enlisted women. These changes included increased security in living environments and designated living spaces accessible only by female personnel. Female personnel had also requested locks on the doors to their private dormitories, and Gorman's plan provided these. Through the policy, female soldiers were also permitted to decorate and personalize some areas of their living space. Between 1962 and 1966, reports showed that Gorman's policy had increased enlistment around 12%. Gorman continued to push for improvements in housing for female personnel throughout the 1960s. In 1963, she adjusted some of her policy's plans for all-female housing, stating that female soldiers in some cases could live in gender-specific wings of male dorms, although they were ideally to be provided female-only entrances. In 1964, Gorman selected American female soldiers to assist in the structuring of a Women's Armed Forces Corps in Vietnam. These women were assigned to support female Vietnamese soldiers in training and supporting a new infrastructure following the departure of American forces from the country. In the last year of Gorman's career as director of the WAC, she pushed for military engineers to maximize living space in bathrooms, private bedrooms and kitchens for female personnel. In 1966, the Women's Army Corps held a groundbreaking ceremony for its newly designed barracks, and Gorman refused to attend, believing the engineers had not made adequate changes. Gorman retired from her position as director in July 1966. Post-military career Upon her retirement, Gorman was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal for her military service during the Cold War. Over the course of her career, Gorman also received an Army Commendation Medal, a WAC Service Medal, American and European-African-Middle Eastern campaign medals, a World War II Victory Medal, an Army of Occupation Medal, a National Defense Medal and a General Staff Identification Badge. After retiring from the military, Gorman worked at the Office of Economic Opportunity, aiding the implementation of programs against poverty. Lt. Col. Gorman died in 2005 at age 96. She is buried at Pulaski Village Cemetery in Pulaski, New York. Personal life In 1962, Gorman received the Kappa Kappa Gamma Alumnae Achievement Award. She was a member of the American Association of University Women, the Business and Professional Women's Foundation, the National Association of Women Deans and Counselors, Robert Edwards American Legion Post 358, Monday Historical Club and Northern Oswego County Ambulance.

A daughter of Storm Cat out of the champion filly Serena's Song she was sold for $3.7 million as a yearling and raced in Europe for the Coolmore Stud organization. Racing as a two-year-old, she won only one minor race but was placed in the Queen Mary Stakes, Silver Flash Stakes, Lowther Stakes, Moyglare Stud Stakes and Cheveley Park Stakes. In the following year she won the Prix de la Grotte and finished second in the Poule d'Essai des Pouliches before recording her biggest success in the Coronation Stakes at Royal Ascot. She was retired at the end of the year and had some success as a broodmare. Background Sophisticat was a dark bay or brown mare bred in Kentucky by Robert and Beverly Lewis. She was sired by Storm Cat, a high-class racehorse who won the Young America Stakes and finished second in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile in 1985. He went on to become an exceptionally successful breeding stallion, and was the Leading sire in North America in 1999 and 2000. The best of his progeny included Aljabr, Bluegrass Cat, Cat Thief, Forestry, Giant's Causeway, Hold That Tiger, Jalil, Life Is Sweet, One Cool Cat, Storm Flag Flying and Tabasco Cat. Sophisticat was the second foal of her dam Serena's Song an outstanding racemare who won eleven Grade I races and was voted American Champion Three-Year-Old Filly in 1995. In July, the yearling filly was consigned by the Lewises to the Keeneland sale and was bought for $3.4 million by the bloodstock agent Dermot \\"Demi\\" O'Byrne, acting on behalf of John Magnier's Coolmore organisation. She was sent to Europe and entered training with Aidan O'Brien at Ballydoyle. Like many Coolmore horses, the details of Sophisticat's ownership varied for race to race: she was sometimes listed as the property of Michael Tabor, whilst on others she was described as being owned in partnership by Tabor and Susan Magnier. She was ridden in nine of her twelve races by Mick Kinane. Racing career 2001: two-year-old season Sophisticat began her racing career in a five furlong maiden race at Leopardstown Racecourse on 13 May in which she was ridden by Colm O'Donoghue and finished second to High Society. On 4 June the filly was moved up in distance for a six furlong maiden at Naas Racecourse. She started the 2/7 and won \\"comfortably\\" by four lengths from Real Delight and eight others. Sophisticat failed to win again in six attempts in the rest of 2001 but was placed in several major races. In June she was sent to England to contest the five furlong Queen Mary Stakes at Royal Ascot and finished second of the twenty runners, half a lengths behind the winner Queen's Logic. In July she started 1/3 favourite for the Silver Flash Stakes at Leopardstown but was beaten a length by the Dermot Weld-trained Agnetha after failing to obtain a clear run in the straight. Kinane's performance on the filly resulted in a two-day suspension for careless riding. In August she returned to England and faced Queen's Logic and the Cherry Hinton Stakes winner Silent Honor in the Lowther Stakes at York Racecourse. She took the lead approaching the final furlong but was overtaken by Queen's Logic in the closing stages and finished second again, one and a quarter lengths behind the winner. Ten days later she was moved up in distance for the Group One Moyglare Stud Stakes over seven furlongs at the Curragh in which she was ridden by Seamie Heffernan, with Kinane riding her more fancied stablemate Quarter Moon. Sophisticat took the lead a quarter of a mile from the finish but was overtaken in the final furlong and finished third behind Quarter Moon and Dressed To Thrill. On her last European appearance of 2001, Sophisticat started second favourite behind Queen's Logic in the Group One Cheveley Park Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse on 2 October. After being restrained by Kinane in the early stages she moved up into second place behind the favourite in the last quarter mile but could make no impression on the British and finished second, beaten seven lengths. In November Sophisticat was sent to the United States to contest the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies over eight and a half furlongs at Belmont Park. Racing on dirt for the first time, she finished fifth of the nine runners, six lengths behind the winner Tempera and one place ahead of Take Charge Lady. 2002: three-year-old season On her three- year-old debut, Sophisticat was sent to France and started 9/5 favourite for the Group Three Prix de la Grotte over 1600 metres at Longchamp Racecourse. Ridden by Jamie Spencer, she was restrained at the back of the six-runner field until the last 300 metras. She was then switched to the outside, took the lead 100 metres from the finish and won by three quarters of a length and half a lengths from Dublino and Firth of Lorne. Aidan O'Brien commented \\"she did it very sweetly\\". A month later, Sophisticat returned to France for the Poule d'Essai des Pouliches over the same course and distance. Starting at odds of 13.6/1 in a seventeen-runner field she turned into the straight in ninth place before making steady progress to finish third behind the John Gosden-trained Zenda and the favourite Firth of Lorne. Sophisticat faced Zenda again in the Coronation Stakes at Royal Ascot and started the 11/2 third choice in the betting. The favourite was the Luca Cumani-trained Gossamer, whose wins included the Fillies' Mile and the Irish 1000 Guineas, whilst the other contenders included Dolores (fourth in the 1000 Guineas) and Misterah (Nell Gwyn Stakes). Racing on good to firm ground she was held up towards the rear of the field before making progress in the straight, but failed to obtain a clear run when Kinane attempted to make a challenge along the inside. When she was switched to the outside with a furlong to run she accelerated strongly, overtook Zenda in the final strides and on by a neck. Dolores finished two and a half lengths back in third ahead of Misterah. O'Brien commented \\"Sophisticat has an unbelievable amount of pace and when Mick got clear she really flew. She has been very unlucky as things have to go her way - she is a brilliant filly but she has plenty of attitude. She kept meeting Queen's Logic last year when circumstances did not work in her favour but she is a filly with an awful lot of ability\\". On her final appearance, Sophisticat started 3/1 second favourite for the Matron Stakes on 7 September at Leopardstown in which she was matched against older fillies and mares. Despite being accompanied by two stablemates who acted as pacemakers, she never looked likely to win and finished sixth of the nine runners behind Dressed To Thrill. After the race she was reported to be in \\"respiratory distress\\". Breeding record At the end of her racing career, Sophisticat was retired to become a broodmare for Coolmore's Pacelco branch. She has produced seven foals and three winners: *Suppose, a bay filly, foaled in 2004, sired by Danehill. Failed to win in four races. *Sefroua, bay filly, 2005, by Kingmambo.

They were built in the 17th century to defend the Margraviate of Baden from French invasion. Together with their adjoining defensive lines, the Black Forest fortifications formed a defensive system over 200 kilometres long that ran from north to south.  Construction  These defensive positions were built during the time of the conflicts between the House of Habsburg and the Kingdom of France in the 17th and 18th centuries, mainly during the War of the Palatine Succession and the War of the Spanish Succession. After the events of 1689 (including the destruction of Heidelberg Castle), Margrave Louis William of Baden-Baden (1655‚Äì1707), who was also known as \\"Turkish Louis\\" thanks to his distinguished service in the Great Turkish War, was given the imperial command of the defence of Germany against the advancing French. Between 1692 and 1701, the margrave had an extensive system of fortifications built on the Upper Rhine in the form of linked schanzen. These fixed defensive bulwarks built into the so-called \\"lines\\" of defence could be quickly enhanced by other earthworks. Several of the schanzen had already been built at the time of the Thirty Years' War or integrated even older, sometimes late medieval fortifications into their system. The positions were built by inhabitants of the local villages and towns who were forced to work on them; in later years soldiers were also used.  Location and main sites  Star schanze at the B√∂llener Eck near Neuenweg The extensive fortification system runs for over 200 kilometres through the Black Forest between the High Rhine in the south and Heidelberg in the north. Between Bad S√§ckingen and Feldberg the system is divided into an older \\"Rear Line\\" (Hintere Linie), which dates to the 1680s and 1690s, and a more recent \\"Forward Line\\" (Vordere Linie). Its beginning is marked by the Rothausschanze west of Murg, which was built during the Thirty Years' War. It was investigated archaeologically and geophysically in 2007 when the new A98 motorway was built. This showed that the redoubt was protected by a ditch, 8.3 metres wide and at least 3.6 metres deep. The defensive wall, with a thickness of about 2 metres, was a dry stone wall set into the inner flanks of the ditch. Especially well preserved are the works at the so-called B√∂llener Eck (\\"B√∂llen Corner\\") near Neuenweg, where there is a star schanze and a square redoubt that belong to the Forward Line. The defensive system is partly coextensive with the Landhag, a late medieval fortification. The five-pointed star schanze has a diameter of about 30 metres and ditches that are still about 2 to 3 metres deep today. The square redoubt has sides 20 metres long. Between the two positions there are traces of a schanze line, that consists of a ditch and bank and which continues southwards. The epitaph of the schanze commandant, Johann Marckloffksy von Zabrak, who died in 1691, is on the eastern side of the church at Neuenweg. Another important defensive line exists in the Wagensteig valley near Kirchzarten where, in the late 17th century, a system of redoubts, banks and ditches was built. It starts above the H√∂llental valley and finishes in the north near the Hohle Graben. In 1690 fighting is recorded near Breitnau, but by the early 18th century most positions had lost their military importance. The northern site at the Hohle Graben is the largest schanze of the whole defensive system and was built before 1638. In 1679 over 4,000 men were garrisoned here and in the years that followed there were numerous isolated battles. 1734 is the year when the last construction work on the schanze is documented; its military significance came to an end after the last battle in 1796. Baroque Schanze at the H√∂chst near Oberprechtal Another important route across the Black Forest runs through the Kinzig valley, which is why there are numerous schanze positions here. Several sites are located near the Kinzig, others protect by roads. On the watershed between the Elz and Gutach is a fortification system that was built to guard the crossing to Hornberg. The line starts west of the Rensberg and continues over the Schnallenkopf and the Ziegelkopf eastwards to Hornberg. Another line runs over the Horniskopf and the H√∂chst to the Scheibeneck and guarded the road from Oberprechtal to Gutach im Breisgau, where the L107 runs today. In the north the Black Forest lines link up with the Eppingen lines that stretch from Pforzheim to Neckargem√ºnd and were built between 1695 and 1697. After the construction of the French fortress of Fort Louis on the Rhine north of Strasbourg towards the end of the 17th century, Louis William had the B√ºhl- Stollhofen Line built which ran from the fort through the Baden Rhine Plain to the Black Forest and, following its destruction in 1707, was replaced by the Ettlingen Line.  Development and inventorying  Until 2002, only about six to eight schanzen positions were known and documented in the literature. Thanks to the work of the firm of AG Minifossi at the Friedrich Ebert School in Schopfheim other schanzen were discovered so that, today, over 100 sites are known. As part of its activities the project also supported the reconstruction of the schanze of Gersbach-Mettlen, where the Forward and Rear Lines divide. This reconstruction was opened on 21 May 2008 and is freely accessible. Around Gersbach the roughly 10-kilometre-long Schanzenweg footpath runs past several of the defensive works. The historical schanzen are still recognisable in places in the terrain; in other places they are only known from archaeological traces. The inventorying of the numerous works is under way.

He was an influential member of the Caodong school of Chan Buddhism. Biography Wansong was born into the Cai family from Jie county in Hezhong (modern Yuncheng in Shanxi). At the age of fifteen he went to Xingzhou (modern Xingtai in Hebei) where he became a monk, taking the religious name Xingxiu. He then travelled to Cizhou (modern Ci County) to study under Chan Master Xueyan Huiman () (1136‚Äì1206). Later he returned to Xingzhou where he lived in the Wansong (\\"ten thousand pines\\") Studio, and called himself the \\"Old Man of Ten Thousand Pines\\" (Wansong Laoren ). In 1193 Wansong came to the attention of Emperor Zhangzong of Jin (reigned 1189‚Äì1208), who invited him to court in order to expound Buddhist teaching. Impressed by his knowledge the emperor presented Wansong with a brocade monk's robe, and asked him to move to the central capital Zhongdu (modern Beijing). In 1197 Wansong moved to Bao'en Temple () to the west of the central capital, where he resided in the Congrong hermitage (). In 1215 the Jin capital of Zhongdu was sacked by the Mongols, and the Jin capital was relocated to Kaifeng. However, Wansong remained at Bao'en Temple, outside the city now renamed Yanjing. In 1223 the Khitan statesman Yel√º Chucai (1190‚Äì1244), who had surrendered to the Mongols in 1218, visited Wansong to receive Buddhist instruction from him, and thereafter he frequently visited Wansong to ask his advice. In 1230 Wansong was made abbot of Wanshou Temple () in Yanjjing. Wansong died at the age of 81. Just before his death he composed a gatha: \\"Eighty-one years old, only this one saying; cherish and value all people, and never make a false move\\" (). He was succeeded as master of Bao'en Temple by Linquan Conglun (). Works Wansong wrote two important commentaries on k≈çan compiled by Hongzhi Zhengjue (1091‚Äì1157). In 1224, at the urging of Yel√º Chucai, he published a commentary to a collection of one hundred songgu () k≈çan by Hongzhi under the title Congrong Lu (), known in English as the Book of Equanimity or the Encouragement (Hermitage) Record. Wansong's commentary edition ensured the survival of Hongzhi's k≈çan, and came to be regarded as one of the seminal texts of the Caodong school. Wansong also wrote a commentary on Hongzhi's niangu () k≈çan, entitled Qingyi Lu (), known in English as Record of Seeking Additional Instruction. He also wrote a collection of sayings entitled Wanshou Yulu (), with a preface dated 1235. Pagoda of the Old Man of Wansong After the death of Wansong, his disciples built an octagonal seven-storeyed brick pagoda, in height, in Yanjing (modern Beijing) to house his remains. In 1753, during the reign of the Qianlong Emperor of the Qing dynasty, a new nine- storeyed brick pagoda, in height, was built around the original pagoda, and it was not until 1986 that the original Yuan dynasty pagoda was rediscovered to be still intact inside the later pagoda.

Early life Blake was born on 7 February 1846 in Newtown Anner House, near Clonmel, County Tipperary. Though her date of birth is often cited at 1845. She was the eldest daughter of Catherine Isabella Osborne and Ralph Bernal Osborne, who took his wife's surname following their marriage in 1844. The Osbornes appear to have become estranged early in their marriage, with her father living in London, seeing Edith and her Grace raised by her mother alone. Mrs Osbourne was a talented artist, and encouraged both her daughters to take up artistic pursuits. Artists often stayed at Newtown Anner, including Thomas Shotter Boys and Alexandre Calame, and it is possible the sisters received tuition from them. Edith developed an interest in botany around this time, corresponding over the years with Newtown Anner's garden designer Joseph Paxton. Fanny Currey was a frequent visitor to the house, with the pair collaborating on illustrating envelopes from 1858 to 1868. In 1874 she married widower and Royal Irish Constabulary sub-inspector Henry Arthur Blake. As her parents did not approve of the marriage and had been arranging a suitable marriage for her, the couple eloped. Following the marriage, Edith was disinherited. They were sheltered for a time by friends Richard and Harriet Bagwell of Marlfield House. The couple went on to have two sons and a daughter. They first moved to Belfast, seeing Henry appointed resident magistrate (RM) in 1876 and a \\"special RM\\" during the land war. When he received assassination threats, Edith would travel with him armed with a gun. Despite her husband's work, Blake was sympathetic to romantic nationalism and became friends with Anna Parnell. Illustration and writing Blake toured Europe in 1872, visiting Austria, (Germany), Italy, Sicily, Greece, and Turkey. During these visits she took sketches of the local architecture, art, and culture which she published in her first book Twelve months in southern Europe (1876). Blake's second publication was The realities of Freemasonry in 1879. Blake's husband received his first appointment in the British colonial service in 1884, as governor of The Bahamas 1884 to 1887, followed by Newfoundland 1887 to 1888, Jamaica 1889 to 1897, Hong Kong 1898 to 1903, and Ceylon 1903 to 1907. Blake travelled with him, and rather than entertaining the local English expatriate community, she focused on her time on botany and painting. She studied local flora and fauna in watercolour, which she painted from nature. These were exhibited at the Museum of Science and Art, Dublin in 1894. 196 of her studies of the life stages of Jamaican lepidoptera are in the entomology library of the Natural History Museum, London, and more of her work is held by the National Botanic Gardens, Dublin. It is said that whilst in the Bahamas she was painted with a pet snake wrapped around her waist. Blake produced landscapes, and painted the opening of the 1888 Newfoundland Placentia Railway. She contributed to a number of English and American scientific journals, and was heavily involved in the development of the countries the couple lived in. The National Museum of the Native American in New York holds her collection of over a 100 Native American artefacts from the Bahamas. She was an accomplished linguist, speaking 9 languages including Irish, Russian, and Chinese. The couple's three children were painted by Winslow Homer in Arabian dress. In 1907, Blake opened a Buddhist nunnery which was named in her honour in Sri Lanka. Later life Upon Henry's retirement in 1907, the Blakes returned to Ireland. They settled in Myrtle Grove, Youghal, County Cork, where many of Blakes sketchbooks are still held. The staircase was decorated by her with botanical illustrations. As Lady Blake she published 3 plays: Samhain's eve, The quest of Edain, and The swan, all adapted from Irish mythology. Following her husband's death in 1918, Blake lived as a near recluse wearing widows weeds, but continued to paint. She died in Myrtle Grove on 18 April 1926. The couple are buried in the garden of the house. Her collection in Natural History Museum, London was conserved in 1984 and are noted for their scientific value.

It is located on the northern edge of the mountain plateau on which central Jerusalem lies. The neighborhood was established in the late 1960s by Rabbi Mordechai Elefant, in co-operation with the Jewish Agency for Israel, to encourage American Jewish immigration to Israel. The small neighborhood is usually associated with the larger, adjoining neighborhoods of Kiryat Mattersdorf to the west or Unsdorf to the northeast. History Small playground beside buildings of Kiryat Itri Kiryat Itri was established in 1967 by the Israel Torah Research Institute (ITRI) of New York City, under the leadership of Rabbi Mordechai Elefant, institute dean. Elefant established Yeshivas Itri in the southeast of the city the following year. The housing development was undertaken in co-operation with the Jewish Agency for Israel, to encourage American Jewish immigration to Israel. Construction costs exceeded 30 million Israeli liras (USD$7.5 million, or $ in current dollar terms). The neighborhood was planned along the northern edge of the mountain plateau on which central Jerusalem lies, adjacent to the newly built neighborhood of Kiryat Mattersdorf. Its viability was threatened before construction even began, when, in the spring of 1967, it was found that the site abutted a rock quarry to the south in Romema, which bombarded the area with dust and noise from explosions. Elefant and the owners of the quarry appeared before a district planning committee to discuss the relocation of the quarry. Kiryat Itri was planned for 250 families. Three high-rise apartment buildings were erected on the south side of the street, and five low-rise apartment buildings on the north side. The flats were small by American standards. A supermarket and postal agency occupy the ground floor of 14 Sorotzkin, the westernmost building. The main street, Rechov Sorotzkin, is named after Rabbi Zalman Sorotzkin. The first residents, comprising 85 individuals and 65 families, arrived in Israel from the United States in August 1968. Singles and young people were temporarily lodged in a former British hospital in Beit Safafa and in the Orient House hotel to await completion of their apartments, while families were lodged in rented homes. Occupancy began in 1969.

The story follows a teenager who plays an online video game about defending against an alien invasion, only to find out that the game is a simulator to prepare him and people around the world for defending against an actual alien invasion. Wil Wheaton, who narrated the audiobook version of Cline's previous novel, Ready Player One, performs the audiobook of Armada as well. Plans for a film adaptation are also in process.  Summary  Zack Lightman, a high school senior with a reputation for getting into trouble, is one of the top players in the world of the video game Armada, an online combat flight simulation game in which the Earth Defense Alliance attempts to save the earth from extraterrestrial invasion. One day, Zack sees a ship outside his classroom window that resembles one of those from Armada, and returns home to look through his late father Xavier's notebooks about a conspiracy theory involving pop culture films (Star Wars, Flight of the Navigator, The Last Starfighter), novels (Ender's Game), and video games about alien invasions and military simulations. Later, at the video game shop where Zack works part-time, his boss Ray surprises him with a fancy new controller for Armada as an early graduation gift. He tries it out on one of the new special missions on Armada that involves attacking the home planet of the aliens, but the Earth team fails. The next morning, while Zack is fighting bully Douglas Knotcher at his school, a shuttlecraft with the Earth Defense Alliance (EDA) logo lands. Ray is one of the passengers, and he invites Zack to join him at a top-secret military facility in Nebraska. There, he learns that the EDA is real, that there are actually aliens from Europa (dubbed Sobrukai) planning to invade the planet with ships as shown in the Armada game, and that the EDA had been using Armada to identify and train skilled soldiers to pilot drone ships to protect Earth from the Europans. The EDA reveals that the Europans have planned a three-phase full-scale attack in less than eight hours. Shortly after the briefing, the Nebraska base is attacked by a scouting party, during which Zack disobeys orders by chasing down an invading ship into one of the deploying tunnels, where the ship self-destructs and destroys several hundred EDA drones. Although Zack is scolded by Admiral Vance for the action, he and other top performing Armada players are deployed to Moon Base Alpha, where he will be reporting to his father Xavier, who had faked his death in a factory accident to serve as an EDA general. In the first wave of attacks, the EDA moon base is attacked by Europan drones. The new recruits attempt to defend it, but ultimately fail and flee to Earth. Zack and his father theorize that the entire Europan invasion is only a test to discover how Earth would respond to a civilization-ending threat, given that the aliens could have easily wiped them out at any time, but had let them have opportunities to fight back and win. They determined that a probe that Earth had sent to Europa decades ago was actually a warhead called Icebreaker designed to destroy the Europans, meaning that Earth had struck first and had initiated the entire war. They realize that a second Icebreaker warhead had been deployed to detonate on Europa around the time of the second wave, which would result in mutually assured destruction. With the second wave starting, Xavier raids an EDA base containing the pilots who are escorting the warhead and sacrifices himself. Zack then activates his drones near Europa to defeat the escorts and destroy the Icebreaker, resulting in the alien ships powering down and falling to Earth. An icosahedron arises from Europa and identifies itself as the Emissary, a machine that was created by a galactic community of civilizations called the Sodality. The Emissary had orchestrated the entire situation as a test to see if humanity could exist peacefully with their group, and declares that Earth has passed. Zack accepts the membership in the Sodality on behalf of Earth, and the third wave of alien ships arrive to aid the survivors and to restore the planet. Zack later accepts a job as ambassador to the Sodality, in order to learn the aliens' true motives. Reception Armada was a New York Times bestseller,New York Times Best Seller List / Hardcover Fiction: August 2, 2015 debuting at #4 and remaining on the list for five weeks. Reviews of the book were generally negative. The Washington Post described it as \\"nostalgic narcissism\\", The Boston Globe praised it for being \\"screenplay- ready\\", but called it \\"a tedious exercise in nostalgia and sci-fi clich√©\\" and criticized it for engaging in \\"the worst sort of nerdy wish-fulfillment fantasy\\", and The Globe and Mail complained that the book had predictable plots and characters and that it failed to do \\"anything stimulating\\" with its pop culture references other than reminding readers of them. Io9 said the novel is a \\"mostly worthwhile read\\" and \\"perfectly suited for the cinema\\" despite the fact that \\"doesn't quite live up to expectations\\", The Verge described it as \\"a pretty fun ride\\" but complained about the predictable plot and \\"the lack of depth you'll find in most characters\\", and Slate described it as \\"a book-length love letter of cultural hyperlinks that refer you elsewhere but contain no meaningful content themselves\\" and said it embodied \\"everything wrong with gaming culture\\". Michael J. Nelson's and Conor Lastowka's podcast series 372 Pages We'll Never Get Back analysed and criticised Armada in 2018. Contest As he did with the paperback release of his debut novel Ready Player One, Cline held a video game contest to celebrate the release of the paperback of Armada.Wired Magazine: ARMADA NOVEL GETS HIGH-SCORE CONTEST, TOTALLY 80S VIDEO Readers could play a web browser version of Pha√´ton (the faux-retro shooter game featured in the book) and the top scorer won an Oculus Rift. All players who scored at least 525 points in the game won an embroidered \\"Earth Defense Alliance\\" patch, another reference to the book and a nod to the Activision patch promotions of the 1980s. Film adaptation In December 2015, Cline announced the sale of Armada's film rights to Universal Pictures for a reported seven-figure sum. In April 2018, Universal hired Dan Mazeau to write a new draft of the screenplay, in collaboration with Cline and producers Dylan Clark and Dan Farah.

Barbera van Meerten-Schilperoort (3 January 1778, Geestbrug - 14 February 1853, Gouda), was a Dutch women's rights activist.  Early life  She came from a burgher family, and married the vicar Hendrik van Meerten (ca 1760-1830) in 1794. She was given an education in a finishing school, which was described as shallow, as was the custom for education offered in the schools for girls at that time.  Career  Because of the poverty of the family caused by the French invasion in 1795, she started to give private lessons to contribute to the income of the family. She eventually opened a small girls' school. In 1815, her spouse was appointed school inspector, and through him, she introduced a petition of training courses for teachers in 1816, which was, however, not accepted. She also published several books on education, advice to women, novels, and other works. In 1821‚Äì1835, she was the editor of the paper Penelope. Her school became one of the most notable institutes of education for women in the Netherlands. She spoke for difference feminism, and argued that women should be given a more public role in the service of the state. In 1832, she started philanthropic work for the betterment of the conditions of female prisoners, and in 1841, she founded the charity association Hulpbetoon aan Eerlijke en Vlijtige Armoede, which was the first women's organization in the Netherlands. She has been referred to as the founder of the organized women's rights movement in the Netherlands. References * Bonnie G.

Norman is the founder and director of Ari D Norman Ltd, international supplier of sterling silver designs to the trade and consumer market, and creator of the Ari D Norman brand. Norman was the first and only silversmith to win the Queen‚Äôs Award for Export Achievement in 1989 and was awarded Freedom of the City of London in 1992 for services rendered to the British Silver industry. He currently lives and works in North West London with his two sons, Lee and Adam. Early life Ari Norman‚Äôs paternal grandfather, Leibish Nussbaum, a Polish diamond cleaver was arrested in Marmande in the Southern French region of Lot-et-Garonne in 1942, where he and his wife were in hiding during WWII and taken via Drancy to the concentration camp Auschwitz where he was killed as part of the Holocaust. Some of his other family went into hiding in Lot-et- Garonne, including his grandmother Perla, his aunt Laura and her husband Nathan. They were hidden by a Resistance member, called Lucienne Deguilhem, who had a large house in Monbahus. Norman‚Äôs cousin Jacques was born during this time in hiding. Norman‚Äôs father, Shabse Nussbaum (later Sydney Norman), escaped the Holocaust by boarding a ship he thought was headed for the South of France only to discover he was headed for England. There he stayed, married Phillys Larkham who had originally taken him in as a Belgian refugee, and continued to work in the diamond industry for many years. In 1956, with his mother and four older sisters, Ari Norman went to live in Liberia, aged nine, with two pet chimps, a pygmy deer and a couple of pygmy hippos, whilst his father pursued his passion for discovering diamonds in West Africa. His father had an eventual breakthrough and was one of the first people to help discover diamonds in the rivers and jungles of Liberia. He was honoured by the Liberian President Tubman in the 1960s. Having studied to become a Civil Engineer, Norman returned to Liberia in his 20s to help build roads and bridges for his father‚Äôs expanding diamond mine but chose not to focus on Civil Engineering as a career path. Instead he travelled across North and South America through his 20s and 30s. His father's diamond mine became unworkable due to its location in such an unstable region and he sold it on, only to be given it back for free a few years later. In May 2014, Lucienne Deguilhem was posthumously awarded ‚ÄòJust Amongst Nations‚Äô by Yad Vashem, World centre for Holocaust research, to coincide with the first National Day of Resistance in France. Career Queen's Award for Export Achievement Certificate Certificate of the Freedom of the City of London Ari Norman had decided that wherever he travelled in the world, he would pick up local craft samples and send them back home. As Norman was on his world travels, he collected a wide range of items including ethnic jewellery and clothing and shipped them all home. Once back in London, Norman and his father decided to offer these unique items for sale to retailers in the West End and around the King‚Äôs Road. Mexican Silver proved to be the most popular. Norman sold every sample he had shipped home and received future orders for items he didn‚Äôt have. He returned to Mexico where he had found the silver pieces and his business took off. Norman originally bought from retailers in Mexico City but soon moved onto the town of Taxco where the silver craftsmen were based and he could buy from them wholesale. International Jewellery and Crafts was officially born in 1974, run from Norman‚Äôs parents‚Äô house in Willesden, London and would become Ari D Norman Ltd in 1976. Norman initially bought silver jewellery and gift items from Mexican artisans in order to sell directly onto retailers. He then started to design his own work, at first adapting and modify pieces, later creating more and more original pieces until Norman eventually developed his own antique style that would become globally heralded and often copied. Norman took great interest in the Art Nouveau and Art Deco movements and began to design jewellery that reflected these styles. He then drew inspiration from further back in time and would design items heavily influenced by the Victorian art era. These were considered the 'antiques of tomorrow' and drew influence from artists such as Charles Rennie Mackintosh, William Morris, Georges Fouquet, Victor Horta, Rene Lalique and Alphonse Mucha. Norman and his father began to attend trade exhibitions throughout the United Kingdom, branching out to major European exhibitions followed by residencies in North American and Far Eastern trade exhibitions. The Ari D Norman brand grew its global identity throughout the 1980s and 1990s with Norman often attending around 36 international exhibitions a year and exporting to 80 countries. Ari claimed the world record for participating in the most trade exhibitions worldwide. Ari D Norman revived an interest in small sterling silver accessories such as perfume bottles, thimbles, snuffboxes and collectable pillboxes. Norman moved the business from his parents‚Äô house to an office building in Northwest London called Argenta House. He managed to campaign the council for a name change of the local road where the office was situated and it was renamed Argenta Way. Ari D Norman Ltd became 'the brand behind the brand'. Norman was commissioned to create work for many large brands including Parker Pens, The Orient Express and Wedgewood. For Parker Pens, he created a new version of their classic Snake Pen which is now a collectors item. Certificate from Royal College of Arms for Ari Norman Familial Coat of Arms In recognition of his international work, Norman was awarded the Queens Award for Export Achievement in 1989 and was invited to Buckingham Palace. He was unable to attend this event as he was exhibiting abroad but sent his mother along instead. In 1992, he was invited to join the Worshipful Guild of Goldsmiths in recognition of his services to the silver industry and his promotion of the hallmarking system, and was awarded the Freedom of the City of London. Following these awards, Norman was given the right to apply for his own family Coat of Arms. Norman spent a number of years designing the Coat of Arms and created a collection of personal familial symbols as part of the Coat of Arms that would represent his family name over the coming generations. This was presented to Norman by the Royal College of Arms in 1996. Ari Norman has long been an advocate for the hallmarking system and has promoted the system globally. Norman travelled the world explaining the hallmarking system so that clients could understand the craftsmanship and quality that a hallmark signifies. The system is the oldest form of consumer protection in existence. All the silver produced by Ari D Norman Ltd bears the full British Hallmark with the exception of pieces too small or too delicate to bear it, in which case they are marked 925. When Ari D Norman Ltd became the first British silversmith to receive the Queen‚Äôs Award for Export Achievement, to recognise the achievement and the fact that Ari Norman had been one of the most vocal advocates of the system globally, the Queen‚Äôs Award Mark was applied as an additional hallmark to their silver items. This hallmark is unique only to Ari D Norman and has never been authorised to any other silversmith since. It can be found in Bradbury‚Äôs book of Hallmarks. In 2012, Norman commissioned a series of urban art murals to be painted by a local artist, Abe Sesay, across the facade of their headquarters in London depicting a number of race issues from the Olympic Games including the members of the Israeli Olympic team who were murdered at the 1972 Munich Olympics, Tommie Smith and John Carlos who stood for the Black Power movement at the 1968 Olympics and sprinter Jesse Owens who raced at the 1936 Olympics. Ari Norman continues to develop the Ari D Norman brand across the globe and most recently created a new fashion jewellery brand called JewelAri. Personal life Norman cites his grandfather‚Äôs murder at the hands of the Nazis in Auschwitz as a major influence on his actions and character and continues to have a ‚Äòholocaust‚Äô mentality, where nothing in one's life should be taken for granted. \\"I was brought up by a father who was gravely affected by the Holocaust, because his own father was murdered at Auschwitz. I learned the hard way that you have to stand up and be counted, not be scared to show that you're Jewish, and be ready to fight for your independence.\\" Norman was originally born Leon Norman but officially changed his name as a teenager to Ari to reflect his true Jewish heritage. The name Ari is the equivalent Hebrew version of Leon and means Lion. Politically active and a keen traveller, Norman travelled across Europe aged 16 with a friend in order to emigrate to Israel but was detained by Interpol when they got to Italy and sent back home by the British consulate because his friend had not told his parents where they were going. Norman volunteered during the Israeli 6 Day War of 1967 as many of his friends and family were travelling in the opposite direction back to the UK to avoid the conflict. In 2010, his thatched house caught fire and he was forced to watch from over the road for the next eight hours as 8 fire engines tried to put out the roof blaze.

The effort was supported by US-led coalition airstrikes. The Iraqi Army was widely expected to launch the planned operation to retake the actual city of Mosul in the Spring of 2015, but the offensive was postponed to October 2016, after Ramadi fell to ISIL in May 2015.  Background  Ever since the city of Mosul fell to ISIL forces on 10 June 2014, the United States and the Iraqi Government had been planning to retake the city. Initially, the original plan called for an assault on Mosul in July or August 2015, even though some US officials claimed that an attack at that point would be \\"too late.\\" On December 25, 2014, after Hassan Saeed Al-Jabouri, the ISIL governor of Mosul, was killed by a US-led Coalition airstrike in Mosul, it was revealed that the US planned to retake the city of Mosul in January 2015. In late January 2015, Iraqi Army forces began preparing for the assault on Mosul.  Offensive  On 21 January 2015, 5,000 Kurdish Peshmerga soldiers liberated multiple villages neighboring Mosul, amid speculation that the Iraqi Army was preparing for an assault on Mosul. The Peshmerga forces also disrupted essential ISIL supply routes between Mosul, Tal Afar, and Syria, and they reclaimed over 500 kilometers of land in the region. However, Kurdish officials states that they do not plan to move beyond primarily-Kurdish areas, and that retaking the city of Mosul itself was the responsibility of the Iraqi Army. An estimated 200 ISIL fighters were killed. Among the ISIL militants killed was the new ISIL governor of the Nineveh Governorate. Peshmerga forces also positioned themselves on three fronts to the northwest of Mosul, near Badush Dam. Kurdish forces reported firing 20 Grad missiles into Mosul, upon receiving intelligence that ISIL militants were gathering to meet near the city's Zuhour neighborhood. Firing from about 12 miles north of Mosul, Captain Shivan Ahmed said the rockets hit their targets. ISIL claimed that the rockets hit civilians.. On 22 January 2015, the US increased its number of airstrikes near Mosul to a record number of 16. The airstrikes struck two large ISIL units, two ISIL tactical units, an ISIL building, an ISIL mortar team, and destroyed six ISIL culverts, two ISIL bridges, three ISIL buildings, an ISIL artillery system, 11 ISIL vehicles, an ISIL fighting position, six ISIL staging positions, two ISIL heavy weapons, an ISIL VBIED, and four ISIL armored vehicles. The Royal Canadian Air Force has also destroyed numerous ISIL targets around Mosul in support of ground forces. On 23 January 2015, the heightened US airstrike campaign continued, with 8 airstrikes being carried out in and near Mosul. The airstrikes struck three ISIL tactical units and a large ISIL unit, and destroyed seven ISIL vehicles, two ISIL VBIEDs, an ISIL bulldozer, four ISIL buildings, an ISIL artillery system, an ISIL heavy weapon system, two ISIL armored vehicles, an ISIL shipping container, and an ISIL bunker. On 27 January 2015, ISIL launched a surprise attack on the oil-rich Kurdish city of Kirkuk, in an attempt to draw Kurdish Peshmerga fighters away from Mosul. However, Peshmerga forces managed to staunch the attack and regain some lost territory in the region, with the US ramping up their airstrikes near Kirkuk to 19 on 1 February 2015, in response to the ISIL advance. On 4 February 2015, Jordan began launching airstrikes on ISIL positions in Iraq, in retaliation for ISIL's brutal killing of Jordanian pilot Muath al-Kasasbeh. The airstrikes killed 55 ISIL militants in Mosul, including a senior ISIL commander known as the \\"Prince of Nineveh.\\" On 6 February 2015, an RAF Tornado GR4 patrol worked closely with a coalition surveillance platform to provide air support for Peshmerga forces, who were engaged in close combat with ISIL terrorists near Mosul. When an ISIL mortar position opened fire on the Peshmerga, the Tornados responded with a Brimstone missile, scoring a direct hit. On 9 February 2015, John Allen, the U.S. coordinator for the international coalition against ISIL, stated that the Iraqi Army, backed by Coalition airstrikes, will launch a ground offensive \\"in the weeks ahead\\" to regain the territory lost to ISIL, including the city of Mosul. On the same day, Coalition sources reported that the Peshmerga had recaptured additional territory near Mosul. On 10 February, it was revealed that Peshmerga forces were only 6 to 9 miles away from the city center of Mosul, in the northwestern outskirts, and that they had managed to retake the Nineveh plains area (more specifically, the majority of the Tel Keppe District) to the northwest of Mosul.. However, the Kurds stated that they were waiting for further orders to enter the outskirts of Mosul city.  Airstrikes  Between 12 February and 21 June, at least 91 Coalition airstrikes took place near Mosul, striking 23 ISIL tactical units and destroying 31 ISIL fighting positions, 13 vehicles, 12 heavy machine guns, 12 excavators, 11 ISIL buildings, seven armored vehicles, nine staging areas, five rocket and four mortar firing positions, two bulldozers, two IED factories, a checkpoint and a trench system. The sorties included British RAF Tornado GR4 patrols which attacked ISIL defenses around Mosul with Paveway IV laser-guided bombs and Brimstone missiles. The airstrikes killed or wounded dozens of ISIL militants. One round of Coalition strikes on 5 April, killed a total of 18 ISIL militants in Western Mosul, while from 25 to 26 March, US-led Coalition airstrikes were reported to have killed over 150 ISIL militants in Mosul.  Continuing ISIL‚ÄìKurdish clashes, planning, and delays  On 17 February, Iraqi Colonel Masoud Salih stated that the battle to liberate Mosul would probably take 30,000 soldiers, and at least 10 months. Also, he stated that another Iraqi official had estimated a minimum of 12,000 ISIL militants present in the city, dismissing rumors of 30,000 militants being present as \\"ISIS propaganda.\\" In late February 2015, it was revealed that around 25,000 well-trained Iraqi ground troops, trained by American forces, will be deployed to retake the city of Mosul. Additionally, it was revealed that the Iraqi Army should join the liberation effort by April or early May 2015, with the intention of avoiding having to fight during Iraq's summer heat around Ramadan. It was also reported by US General Lloyd Austin that small numbers of US troops could join the fray, if they are needed. On 6 March, it was reported that Shakir al-Hamdani, ISIL's third Governor of Mosul, was killed in a US-led Coalition airstrike. In early March 2015, it was reported that Turkey was planning to send ground troops to participate in the Liberation of Mosul, although a Turkish senior official stated that Turkey may limit its contributions to logistics. On 4 March, the Iraqi Defense Minister stated that Iraq could retake Mosul without help from foreign ground forces. On 11 March, ISIL threatened on loudspeakers to behead any civilian who tries to leave Mosul. The announcement came one day after US planes dropped paper pamphlets into the city, warning of an imminent military confrontation, and advising all civilians to evacuate the city. Also, on the same day, the US-led Coalition carried out five airstrikes in and around Mosul, which struck an ISIL tactical unit, an ISIL outpost, and destroyed an ISIL armored vehicle. On 16 March, the Peshmerga bombed ISIL strongholds in the Forest area of central Mosul from Mount Baashiqa, killing and wounding dozens of ISIL fighters. Eight days later, Peshmerga forces clashed with ISIL forces in eastern Mosul, killing 13 ISIL militants. On 3 May 2015, the Guardian reported that ISIL leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was recovering from severe injuries he received from an 18 March 2015 airstrike, in a part of Mosul. In the meantime, Abu Alaa Afri had assumed control of ISIL as Deputy Leader. It was also reported that al-Baghdadi's spinal injury, which left him incapacitated, means that he may never be able to fully resume direct command of ISIL. On 11 June, Iraqi General Najim al-Jubouri, the commander of the planned operation to retake Mosul, reported that Iraqi special forces were massing to the north of Baghdad and Baiji, in preparation for the coming battle. Units from the 15th and 16th Divisions of the Iraqi Army, federal police, and Golden Brigade were said to have been dispatched. General al- Jubouri also stated that the Iraqi forces deployed had been trained, and that they will be equipped with advanced weapons when the assault begins. He also said that the operation would be accompanied by an intense Coalition air campaign against ISIL positions in Mosul. On 12 June 2015, Head of Ninawa Operations Command General Najim al-Jubouri stated that the planned offensive for Mosul had begun, with Iraqi forces, along with Shi'ite Popular Mobilization Forces fighters, being deployed to the city of Baiji, on the road to Mosul. US-led Coalition warplanes were also reported to be pounding ISIL positions in Mosul. However, it was noted that the only one who could officially declare the start of the battle was the Iraqi Prime Minister Haidar al-Abadi, which he did not. In addition, two days earlier, The Daily Beast interviewed the general who said the date to begin the operation, \\"may be very close but I can't tell you when exactly\\". When pressed he said it would take place in less than a year and that more than 30,000 soldiers would take part, which some analysts found hard to believe since the Iraqi military was still decimated and rebuilding following the successful ISIL offensive of June 2014. The news agency described the general's plan to retake the city as \\"fantasy\\". Another contributing factor to the delay of the offensive was the ISIL capture of Ramadi, the provincial capital of Anbar province, in May 2015. As of late June, Iraqi General al-Jubouri said that forces were still being marshaled for an assault on Mosul, while city residents were becoming increasingly disappointed at the constant delays of the offensive. On 15 June, US airstrikes in Mosul killed Ali Awni al-Harzi, a Tunisian ISIL operative who was a CIA person of interest, and had suspected links to the 2012 Benghazi attack. He was also said to operate closely with ISIL militants in North Africa and across the Middle East. He was the brother of Tariq bin al-Tahar bin al-Falih al-'Awni al-Harzi, who was killed in Syria the following day. On 23 June, Zaalan al-Afari, the finance minister of ISIL, was killed with four other ISIL militants by a booby-trap on the road while returning from the town of Gayara to Mosul. On 13 September, U.S. envoy John Allen said that the battle led by the coalition against ISIL is a long-term battle, but that Mosul would be captured \\"within months\\". Iraqi forces also announced that they had now trained 20,000 soldiers to recapture Mosul. On 14 September, ISIL reportedly killed 15 of its own handicapped, bedridden fighters. The fighters had lost their limbs from waist down while fighting Iraqi and Peshmerga forces and ISIL was said to have killed them due to \\"the inability\\" to provide them with the necessary care. On 21 September, 90 US troops arrived at the base in Makhmur, southwest of Iraq's Kurdish capital Erbil, to train, advise and assist missions in preparation for the campaign on Mosul. It was furthermore speculated that they may take on an active role in the assault itself. On December 17, 2015 ISIL mounted a major offensive against Kurdish positions but were repelled by the Peshmerga and included contact between Canadian special forces on the ground and ISIL. On January 21, 2016, even after the Coalition airstrikes and battlefield losses from previous offensives, it was estimated that ISIL still had up to 10,000 fighters defending Mosul, which would require 24,000+ highly trained Iraqi soldiers to dislodge from the city. On January 23, 2016, it was reported that 400+ ISIL fighters had been killed in clashes with the Peshmerga and other local forces, during the past few days. On February 4, it was reported that 700,000 civilians were still living under ISIL rule in Mosul.

Early life Bramer was born on 15 February 1588 in Felsberg, Germany to a Protestant minister father. The minister later died when Bramer was three years old. This led him to be adopted by his brother-in-law, Jost B√ºrgi, who was a prominent mathematician at the time. He moved to B√ºrgi's home in Kassel after being adopted. B√ºrgi educated Bramer from a young age, particularly in the fields of mathematics and architecture. When Bramer was 16 he stayed in Prague with his foster father after B√ºrgi was appointed to the imperial court. Bramer would stay there for five years before returning to Kassel to begin his career. Career One of his first jobs was as an architectural adviser to Count Christian von Waldeck. He advised him to construct a new church in the town of Widungen, but the out break of the Thirty Years' War caused him to begin focusing on the design of military fortifications. One such fortification was the Rheinfels Castle which he improved for the Count of Solms. In 1635 he became the master builder of Ziegenhain Fortress. Bramer's first scientific publication was in 1617. Titled Problema wie aus bekannt gegebenem sinu eines Grades, Minuten oder Sekunden alle folgenden sinus aufs leichtests zu finden und der canon sinuum zu absolvieren sei he described various measures to calculate sines. He also published a work on vacuums titled Kurze Meldung vom Vacuo oder leerem Orte, neben anderen wunderbaren und subtilen Quaestionen, desgleichen Nic Cusani Dialogus von Waag und Gewicht. In 1630, he constructed an early pantograph enabling him to draw accurate geometric perspective which he described in an earlier 1617 publication titled Trigonometrica planorum mechanica oder Unterricht und Beschreibung eines neuen und sehr bequemen geometrischen Instrumentes zu allerhand Abmessung. Although he is typically not credited with the invention of the pantograph, his early design is superior to the pantograph invented by Christoph Scheiner.

The altarpiece was painted for the Church of SS. Annunziata in the Italian town of Ascoli Piceno, in the region of Marche, to celebrate the self-government granted to the town in 1482 by Pope Sixtus IV. The painting was removed to the Pinacoteca di Brera in Milan in 1811, but passed to Auguste-Louis de Sivry in 1820, and had reached England by the mid-19th century. It has been housed in the National Gallery in London since it was donated by Henry Labouchere, 1st Baron Taunton in 1864. Themes The light ray from the heaven represents Mary's impregnation by the Holy Spirit. The closed passage into the depth at the left and the flask of pure water in Mary's bedroom conventionally refer to Mary's virginity. The winged angel Gabriel is depicted with Saint Emidius, the patron saint of Ascoli Piceno carrying a model of that town. The apple in the foreground represents the forbidden fruit and associated fall of man. The cucumber symbolizes the promise of resurrection and redemption. The peacock symbolizes associated immortality, because it was believed that its flesh never decayed. An oriental carpet adorns the loggia on the first floor of the Mary's house. The bottom portion of the painting features the coats of arms of Pope Sixtus IV and the local bishop, Prospero Caffarelli. The Latin words libertas ecclesiastica (church liberty) refer to the self-government of Ascoli Piceno under the general oversight of the Catholic Church. In fringe theories, the halo of the Holy Spirit on the painting is sometimes interpreted as an UFO. According to historian Massimo Polidoro who says what you are actually seeing is \\"a vortex of angels in the clouds, another frequent representation of God in Medieval and Renaissance sacred works of art\\". Painters at this time used \\"symbolic meanings that were anything but random.\\" Polidoro calls the UFO explanation, \\"reinterpreting with the eyes of twenty-first-century Europeans the product of other cultures\\".

Course The headwaters of the river rise in the Great Dividing Range and flow in a north easterly direction along the northern border of the Jardine River National Park. The creek eventually discharges into Kennedy Inlet then Newcastle Bay and onto the Torres Strait. Catchment The creek's catchment occupies and area of , of which an area of is made up of estuarine wetlands. The area is composed of a variety of habitat and contains great ecological diversity. The southern end of the catchment holds the white silica sand dunes of the Shelburne Bay area with perched freshwater lakes. Savannah woodlands are found at the western side of the catchment, with the Escape River-Kennedy Inlet system, the site of Australia's largest mangrove forest as well as Queensland‚Äôs biggest pearl oyster site found to the north. The only tributary of the creek is Spear Creek which joins shortly before reaching Kennedy Inlet. The hilly areas at the tip of Cape York are made up of Carboniferous volcanic rocks, while further south the geology is Jurassic-Cretaceous sandstone. The lower lying country of the Jardine River National Park is made up of Cainozoic sands and gravels. A total of 31 species of fish are found in the creek, including the glassfish, Pacific Short-finned Eel, kabuna hardyhead, treadfin silver biddy, mouth almighty, concave goby, coal grunter, barramundi, oxeye herring, mangrove jack, eastern rainbowfish, Obbe's catfish, Spotted Blue-eye and Gulf Saratoga. History The traditional owners of the area are the Unjadi and Ankamuti peoples who have lived in the area for thousands of years. The creek is named for the Aboriginal guide, Jackey Jackey, who acted as a guide for Edmund Kennedy during his expedition through the Cape York area in 1848 which resulted in Kennedy's death.

Education Bliss graduated from Yale College in 1812. Early legal career Upon graduation from Yale he entered his father's law office to read the law and study for the Massachusetts Bar Examination, and on being admitted to practice, in September 1815, established himself in Monson, Mass., where he remained for 7 years. He then returned to Springfield, entering into partnership with Jonathan Dwight Jr., whose daughter Mary he married in April 1825. In 1827 he entered public life as a member of the House of Representatives of Mass., and was re-elected in 1828, 1829 and 1853, serving in the last instance as Speaker; he was also chosen a member (and President) of the Massachusetts State Senate in 1835. Among many public enterprises which occupied Bliss' attention, the chief was his bringing the Western Railroad, between Worcester and Albany, to a successful completion. On retiring from the Presidency of this road, in 1846, Bliss visited Europe, and after his return became interested in other railroad schemes, chiefly at the West, in conducting which he gained an enviable reputation.

As an extra attraction he offered every vacation home a Shetland pony and a small carriage. During Pentecost the holiday park opened with twenty-four homes.

It is currently a Lutheran church and part of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Brunswick, which owns around 480 churches. History Exterior The first mention of the community of Lehre was in 888 in old manuscripts at the Fulda monastery. Construction of the church began in the late 12th century or early 13th century. A date inscription found on the tower dates the construction and possible completion of the church to 1214. The church consists of a large square tower with two tall spires, each with four-sided, pyramidical roofs. They give the church a unique look. The two spires are connected by a wooden bridge, jokingly said to be the highest bridge in Lower Saxony. The main tower has round-arched windows facing each direction. During the next several centuries, the church underwent a series of reconstructions and additions. In 1489, a porch was added to the southern wall. A semicircular choir on the eastern wall was also added in the 15th century. There is still a small walled-arched window on the north wall that dates from the first phase of the Romanesque period. Holy Cross Church ‚Äì Lehre Following the Thirty Years' War, Pastor Bernhard Friedrich Lasdorff, who arrived in 1646, became a strong advocate for reconstructing the semi-dilapidated church and spearheaded a number of major changes beginning in 1649. A new bell was cast, weighing , with the inscription, \\"Zu Gottes Ehre in Lehre (To the Glory of God in Lehre)\\". The roof and walls were expanded by while the gabled roof was upgraded with a polygonal design. Large, pointed-arch windows of the nave and chancel also date from this time. Upon completion of the repair work, the church was given the name \\"Holy Cross\\" and given the patron St. Laurentius. Since the surrounding community was unable to fund the reconstruction, they relied heavily on large donations. Donations were received from the larger cities of L√ºneburg, Braunschweig, and Fallersleben. Other donations came from dukes, monasteries, and well-off citizens. In 1674 another bell was cast weighing over . In the 18th century the two steeples were renovated along with the two church clocks. One clock is located on the western wall of the main tower structure and the other faces east on the roof of the southern steeple. Interior The basement is supported by two large arches. In 1649, along with numerous exterior changes, the nave was redesigned in a Baroque style with ornate murals, a flat stucco ceiling was installed, and depictions of Martin Luther and Philipp Melanchthon were also added. In 1766 the pulpit was moved to the south wall and the northern and western mezzanines were restored to include paintings of 20 Old and New Testament scenes. Wall paintings and panel decorations were rediscovered after being painted over in 1833; these were restored in 1910 by . An organ reredos dating to 1833 was removed in 1965. Additional restoration of paintings was completed between 1987 and 1991. Today The church currently houses an Evangelical Lutheran congregation.

The castle lies beside the Kelsie Burn, at the centre of a estate. Originally a 16th-century castle, it was extended and rebuilt as a country house in the early 19th century. After a time as a convalescent home, it is now a private residence once more. History The castle was originally built during the 16th century, and is described as having been in the style of feudal mansions of that period, with a large square tower, narrow spiral staircase, and other indications of the time to which it belonged. An armorial panel dated 1585 is still in place on the castle wall. Towards the close of the 16th century it was in the possession of Walter Mure, a scion of the Auchendrane family, and cousin of the Laird of Auchendrane who devised the murder of Sir Thomas Kennedy of Culzean. This Walter Mure of Cloncaird was the perpetrator of the murder, and was assisted in the execution of his crime by his boon companion, Kennedy of Drumurchy.Millar, A H. (1885) The castles and mansions of Ayrshire illustrated in seventy views with historical and descriptive accounts. Edinburgh Cloncaird was purchased by Henry Ritchie of Craigton and Busbie in the early 19th century. Born in 1777, Henry Ritchie was a descendant of James Ritchie, 'merchand burgess' of Glasgow; whose name appears in the Commissary Register in 1674. The family was settled in Craigton, Lanarkshire in 1746, and Henry's father, James, acquired the estate of Busbie, Ayrshire in 1763 and married 1765 Catharine, daughter of Robert Kerr of Newfield, a grandson of the 1st Marquess of Lothian.History of the Counties of Ayr and Wigton, vol. 3: Cunninghame, by James Paterson, 1866 Ritchie made Cloncaird his chief residence, and in 1814 he had the front entirely re-built and modernised, giving the castle its current appearance. Ritchie succeeded his father at Busbie and Craigton in 1799, and was twice married: to Elizabeth Cathcart (died 1836); then in 1838 to Catherine, daughter of James Fergusson of Kilkerran, 4th Baronet. Ritchie died in 1843 having had three unmarried daughters by his first wife, and the estates passed to his sister's son, William Wallace of Cairnhill. In 1905 Cloncaird was sold by Colonel Wallace to a Mrs Dubs, who he then married in 1908. The castle was extensively renovated at this time. Mrs Dubs died in 1947, and from 1949 the mansion was used as the Dubs Memorial Convalescent Home, operated by the local authority. When this closed the castle returned to private ownership. It was purchased before 2003 by Ephraim Belcher, chairman of Belcher Food Products. The house is a category B listed building.

Pallister commanded bomber squadrons and served as a vice commander of Pease Air Force Base in New Hampshire. During his childhood, Pallister captained the first American high school hockey team to play overseas in Europe. Early life and education Pallister was born to Claude Vincent Pallister and Hortense Pollister on January 24, 1915, and he grew up in Mountain Lakes, New Jersey. Claude Vincent Pallister served as the chief legal adviser to the Reformed Church in America. and as the first mayor of Shoreham, New York. He also served as a commodore of the Port Jefferson Yacht Club in Port Jefferson, New York on Long Island. In 1934, Pallister graduated from the Morristown School (now Morristown-Beard School) in Morristown, New Jersey. He then earned his bachelor's degree at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire. After graduating, Pallister attended New York Law School in Manhattan. In 1992, Morristown-Beard School elected Pallister to the school's Athletic Hall of Fame. During high school, Pallister played forward on Morristown School's ice hockey team. (His brother, Claude V. Jr., also played on the team.) Pallister served as team captain in his senior year. He led the hockey team on an overseas trip to play hockey clubs from Germany, Switzerland, and France between December 1933 and January 1934. The rarity of this sports trip for the time led to extensive coverage in The New York Times and The Literary Digest; the United Press International story carried a headline of \\"Hockey Team Invades Europe\\". The team also received a personal telegram from President Franklin D. Roosevelt wishing them luck: \\"The President sends them [the players] his best wishes for their success in this new field of competition, and wishes them to know of his conviction that they will live up to the best traditions of American sportsman.\\" Military career Pallister enlisted with the U.S. Army Air Corps on January 20, 1942 to serve in World War II as a pilot. After the war ended, Pallister served with the New York Air National Guard. He flew B-26 Invader light bombers for the 114th Bombardment Squadron at Floyd Bennett Field. (The 114th Squadron is now the 114th Fighter Squadron of the Oregon Air National Guard.) During the 1950s and 1960s, Pallister commanded bombing squadrons in California and Illinois. He commanded the 441st Bombardment Squadron with the 320th Bombardment Wing at March Air Force Base in California. After transferring to Orchard Place Airport (now O'Hare International Airport), Pallister commanded the 338th Bombardment Group. He then served as the assistant deputy commander for operations of the 100th Air Refueling Wing at Pease. Pallister later served as the vice commander of Pease. After returning to squadron command, Pallister commanded the 23d Tactical Air Support Squadron in the 504 Tactical Air Support Group between 1967 and 1968. The 504th provided air support for U.S. operations from Nakhon Phanom Royal Air Force Base in Thailand during the Vietnam War. Ship rescues Pallister served as a Shoreham police officer responsible for beach patrol. In 1937, he rescued passengers of a yawl that went adrift on Long Island Sound during an intense thunderstorm. Strong winds from the storm had broken both mainmasts on the 25-foot ship during a journey from Mattituck, New York to Port Jefferson. This had left it floating haphazardly two miles from shore. After rowing a 12-foot dory (a lightweight rowboat) to the ship, Pallister threw its two passengers a connecting line. He then used his rowboat to tow the ship to shore. At the age of 16, Pallister also participated in a rescue of three passengers of a capsized canoe near Rocky Point, New York. He and two friends were mooring their motor boat after a fishing trip when a beachgoer's telescope on North Shore beach observed the overturned canoe. Setting back out, Pallister and his friends (Gilbert Frei and Wentworth Eddy) journeyed to the canoe. They helped the canoe passengers who could not swim (because of their clothing) aboard the motorboat, and toed the canoe to the beach. Family Pallister married Beatrice Imhoff Pallister in 1939. Beatrice Pallister worked as a professional model and volunteered with the U.S. Air Force's Family Services Department. They had two children together: David Pallister, Jr. and Sara D.

The pass provides a strategically important route as an access for ground transport traveling between the Tashkent and Namangan Regions in the Fergana Valley bypassing neighboring Tajikistan. It connects the capital city of Tashkent with Osh, the second- largest city in neighboring Kyrgyzstan. The peak of the pass reaches above sea level. Route For centuries, the Kamchik Pass was part of Central Asia's Silk Road trade route that connected the markets of Asia and Europe. The Tashkent-Osh (A373) international highway now winds through the pass. Approximately 10,000 to 15,000 vehicles travel through the Kamchik Pass each day. Weather The Kamchik Pass is frequently closed in the winter due to avalanche hazards. Mudslides and landslides are also threats to vehicles along the route and the nearby villages. In February 2015, the United Nations Development Programme announced it would help aid a disaster risk-reduction project for the Kamchik Pass. The plan is to improve an early warning monitoring system, emergency assistance and education for the people living in remote and rural disaster-prone regions nearby. The project is funded by the European Commission's Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection Department (ECHO). Railway pass In March 2013, Uzbek Railways announced plans to build a new railway through the Kamchik Pass to allow freight traffic to bypass neighboring Tajikistan. The long electric rail line connects existing railways at Angren and Pap in order to create a direct route between the cities of Tashkent and Namangan. The new rail allows Uzbekistan to abandon the Soviet- era line that cuts across Tajikistan's Sughd Region, saving Uzbekistan a reported $25 million in transit fees it pays to Tajikistan each year.

The Ritz's financial backers began negotiations in 1901 and purchased the Walsingham simultaneously with the Bath Hotel. Though the Walsingham was of fairly new construction, they determined it was too \\"inelegant\\" and demolished the building. One of the considerations that made the transaction appealing to the city was that they would be able to widen Piccadilly when the Walsingham and Bath Hotels were demolished. History An 1869-1874 map of the area showed the Bath Hotel on the corner of Arlington Street and next to it a string of small businesses‚Äîa coach builder, coal merchant, stationer and Cockburn‚Äôs spirits. These were purchased in 1886 and demolished by Lord Walsingham to create the Walsingham House, luxury residential mansion flats, fully staffed and with restaurant facilities. Lord Walsingham had the lavish accommodations built in 1887, by the architect C W Stephens. The eight-storey, red-brick building, designed by Alfred Burr, featured flats which accommodated six bedrooms with en-suite bathrooms, each containing 12,323sq ft of living space. The construction was completed in 1888. Around the turn of the century, the residential mansion-flat concept was transitioned to smaller hotel suites. A decoration of a room at Walsingham House 1897. One of its early residents was Beno√Æt-Constant Coquelin who carried on correspondence with Henry Irving and Lillie Langtry from his residence there. In 1898, the Hotel opened a new dining room which was in the house which the Isthmian Club operated for many years at 105 Piccadilly. Lord Walsingham hired artist Cesare Formilli to complete the decoration of the new dining room, based upon designs that had been presented the previous year at the Paris Salon. Formilli selected the interior furnishings specifically for the room and surrounded it with columns featuring bas-reliefs of dancing girls. On the walls and ceilings were nine frescos, featuring hunting and fishing scenes. According to the tax record description of the property, it was composed of two blocks of buildings, one fronting Piccadilly and the other fronting Arlington. There were two separate entrances and 1/10th of the building was occupied by Lord Walsingham and his servants as a private residence. The remaining building consisted of Block A on Piccadilly and Block B on Arlington, which shared between them staircases and elevators. Block A contained six stories with an attic above. Each floor was accessed by a front staircase for residents and guests and a servant's staircase. On each landing were corridors from where one gained access to the chambers. Each suite featured an entry room, so that the private living chambers were not exposed to anyone entering the unit. The floor arrangement was: 1st floor 8 bedrooms and 9 strong rooms divided amongst 6 chambers, 2nd floor 8 chambers each with a single bedroom and strong room, 3rd floor 10 chambers, 4th floor 12 chambers, 5th floor 10 chambers and 6th floor 9 chambers (6 of which were used as servants' bedrooms). Block B on Arlington was smaller and had 3 chambers on each of four floors and on the fifth floor, 2 bedrooms for servants. The building was demolished in 1904 to make way for the Ritz Hotel.

Published in 1995 by Avon Books, it is the third installment of her D√©bauch√©s series. Set in 1828, the story follows the Marquess of Dain, an aristocrat known as \\"Lord Beelzebub\\" and the \\"Lord of Scoundrels\\" for his unscrupulous, immoral behavior. The son of an English father and Italian mother, Dain is hardened due to a difficult childhood and meets his match in Jessica Trent, a 27-year-old bluestocking more than capable of trading wits with him. Chase had a love for Italian culture, and decided that this background would provide ample motivation for Dain, being the product of his parents' inability to understand each other's cultures. As with many of her stories, Chase made her heroine a strong female, deciding to model Jessica after the type of women who lived a few generations previously and who had \\"a more practical, frank attitude toward sex\\". Lord of Scoundrels is a retelling of the fairytale Beauty and the Beast, with the author stating that like the Beast, Dain is an outcast and misfit among his society. Lord of Scoundrels was positively received upon its release, and in 1996 it earned the RITA Award for \\"Best Short Historical\\", a prize given annually by the Romance Writers of America. Also during that year, Lord of Scoundrels won the Romantic Times \\"Regency Historical Romance\\" award. Literary critics and romance readers have since described it as one of the best historical romances ever written, praising the novel for its wit and well-developed characters. Plot summary ;Background In the story's prologue, Sebastian Ballister is born in Devon to the 2nd Marquess of Dain and his Italian wife, Lucia Usignuolo. The Marquess is disgusted with the child, describing him as the \\"Devil's spawn\\" and a \\"wizened olive thing with large black eyes, ill-proportioned limbs, and a grossly oversize nose\\". Eight years later, the tempestuous Lucia abandons her husband for her lover. Unloved by his father and told that his mother is an \\"evil, godless creature\\", Sebastian is sent off to Eton where he is teased by his classmates over his appearance. The boy grows up learning to hide his feelings; given no inheritance by his father, Sebastian acquires clever ways to make his fortune and uses money to unscrupulously get his way. ;Plot The story begins in 1828, Paris. Sebastian, now the intelligent but immoral 3rd Marquess of Dain, meets his match in Miss Jessica Trent, who has arrived in the city to rescue her unintelligent, nearly penniless brother Bertie from Dain's bad influence. Dain and Jessica are instantly attracted to the other, though each seeks to hide their feelings. Dain has developed a hard, sarcastic personality; he is hostile to noblewomen, as he believes they care only for money. Jessica, a 27-year-old beautiful, strong-willed bluestocking, has refused dozens of marriage proposals over the years and wishes to maintain her independence. The two exchange wits; Jessica requests that Dain send her brother back to England in exchange for a valuable religious icon she will sell him, while Dain wants the icon or else he will destroy her reputation and ruin her brother. They reach an impasse, and while her reputation remains intact, Dain spends the week personally overseeing Bertie's disintegration from excessive drinking and gambling. Jessica angrily confronts him and the two unexpectedly kiss. Later, at a party they almost consummate their relationship before being discovered by other party-goers. Dain coldly departs, assuming Jessica invited the others to force him to honorably marry her, leaving her angry that he would leave her reputation in tatters so casually. Jessica sues him for the loss of her reputation. To her surprise, Dain converts this proposition into a marriage proposal, and they are wedded in London several weeks later. En route to his estate in Devon, Dain assumes she is repulsed by his \\"gross blackamoor's body\\", when the opposite is true. Filled with self-loathing over his appearance and personality, Dain initially avoids consummating their relationship despite Jessica's efforts to seduce him. They eventually do, and Dain apologizes for what he realizes has been his difficult behavior. Later, they enter into a disagreement over his illegitimate son; Dain despises the eight-year-old boy's calculating mother and wants nothing to do with them, while Jessica sympathetically wants to rescue the boy from his poor living conditions. The boy, Dominick, is becoming ill-behaved and reminds Dain self-loathingly of himself at his age. Eventually, with Jessica's prodding, Dain is persuaded to rescue the neglected boy from his mother's clutches. While doing so, the Marquess comes to terms with his mother's abandonment and realizes that Dominick is just as scared and lonely as he was as a boy. Dominick is invited to live at the Ballister estate, while the boy's mother, to her pleasure, is given a large stipend and told to find her fortune in Paris. Background and development American author Loretta Chase began her writing career in 1987 by crafting traditional novels in the Regency romance literary subgenre; Lord of Scoundrels, published in 1995, was her ninth such novel released. It was the third installment of her D√©bauch√©s (also known as Scoundrels) series, following The Lion's Daughter (1992) and Captives of the Night (1994). As such, some of the characters who feature in Lord of Scoundrels, such as the Comte d'Esmond and Francis Beaumont, also appear in previous Chase works. In 2007, Chase said Lord of Scoundrels was her only book \\"that came to me as a gift from the writing gods. Every other book is a struggle, some bloodier than others. This book was pure fun from start to finish\\". Possessing a love for Italian culture, Chase decided to make her male protagonist, Dain, a \\"mongrel English aristocrat\\" and half-Italian. By giving Dain Italian ancestry through his mother, Chase was able to develop his character and justify his motivations. She explains, \\"Having Dain be half-Italian fit so many aspects of his story: his background as well as his behavior, which does get operatic at times\\". Chase adds that Dain's difficult childhood stemmed from his parents' inability to accept each other's cultures, which then \\"warps him and makes him a misfit. In a loving household, he would have grown up with a better self-image, and would have dealt with bullying at school in a different way, and thus would have grown up into someone altogether different from the man Jessica meets in that antique shop\\". When writing the novel, Chase knew that her female protagonist had to be strong enough to equal Dain's forceful personality. Chase admits that because the novel is set in the period leading up to the Victorian era, a woman like Jessica could not have dealt with Dain, writing that \\"if Jessica were like what we assume to be the typical young lady of her time, she could never handle Dain, and he‚Äôd think her too boring to live\\". Chase instead modeled Jessica after the type of women who lived a few generations previously and who had \\"a more practical, frank attitude toward sex\\". Wishing to depict Jessica as the \\"Extreme Female\\", Chase emphasizes her clothing and gives Dain \\"a chance to exercise his caustic wit\\", as he deems the latest fashions to be ridiculous. Upon their first meeting he silently observes that Jessica is wearing \\"a blue overgarment of some sort and one of the hideously overdecorated bonnets currently in fashion\\". Jessica differs from many other Chase heroines by being interested in fashion; the author felt that \\"the way they dress, to a great extent, tells us who they are, in the same way that other heroines‚Äô simpler or less fashionable attire expresses something about them\\". Analysis Lord of Scoundrels has been described as a modern retelling of Beauty and the Beast (1874 representation pictured) Lord of Scoundrels is typically classified as a Regency romance novel, though its story is set in the post-Regency era of 1828. It features a strong female heroine, a characteristic that Chase has become known for including in her romances. The author explains that \\"for most of history, and in too many cases today, women are considered (and too often consider themselves) lesser beings who do not matter. In my books, the women are not lesser, and they do matter. In other words, I make the world the way I think it should be\\". Romantic fiction scholars have identified Jessica Trent as a \\"feminist heroine\\" with whom the \\"alpha male hero\\" has met his match. Chase inverts many qualities typical of the archetypical romantic hero and heroine. Near the end of the story, Jessica is the one who initiates consummation of their marriage, by seducing Dain. Afterwards, Jessica promptly falls asleep, causing her husband to seethe \\"that was what he was supposed to do\\". In her entry for The Bloomsbury Introduction to Popular Fiction, Maryan Wherry posits that Lord of Scoundrels represents a modern retelling of the classic fairytale Beauty and the Beast, suggesting Chase's story is a morality tale of \\"restoring humanity\\" that is directed at \\"all levels of society\\" (rather than at the lower classes as classic fairytales were intended). Chase makes direct reference to this fairytale in the novel, when Dain silently compares his relationship with Jessica to that of Beauty and the Beast. In a 2007 interview, the author described the novel as her \\"Beauty and the Beast story\\", stating that like the Beast, Dain is an outcast and misfit among the novel's society. Chase describes Dain as \\"truly awful: rude, overbearing, and intimidating... He consciously uses his monstrousness in the same way he uses his vast wealth and his social position: to control his world and protect himself. It's sad, in a way, because he‚Äôs isolated, like the Beast of the fairy tale trapped in his castle. But Dain is not pitiful by any means: He‚Äôs smart, cynical, and sarcastic, with a sharp eye for the ridiculous. He has a sense of humor and is adept with clever comebacks and putdowns\\". Jessica represents the Beauty of the story, someone who \\"enters the Beast‚Äôs lair of her own accord\\" as his equal \\"no matter how awful\\" he acts. Leading up to the couple's marriage, Dain cynically makes many assurances that he will provide for Jessica financially. At one point, Jessica brings a defamation lawsuit against Dain before they agree to convert it into a prenuptial agreement, leading English professor Jayashree Kambl√© to liken their relationship to \\"a take-over bid\\". Kambl√© has studied the presence of capitalism and modern economics on storylines in the contemporary romance genre. To her, while Lord of Scoundrels is a Regency romance novel and thus less apt to depict the types of economic pairings seen in many contemporary romances, Kambl√© argues that Dain's repeated monetary promises still contain \\"echoes of the kind of wealth, monetary security, and financial reward that the heroes of Harlequin Mills and Boon promise as husbands\\". The couple is physically attracted to each other, while financial considerations also play a factor. Release and reception Lord of Scoundrels was released in January 1995 by Avon Books, the same publisher that had released Chase's last two novels. According to Chase's website, the novel has been published in over fourteen languages. A Spanish translation was released in 2006, while a Japanese translation was released in 2008. Its e-book edition, published by HarperCollins, landed on The New York Times Best Seller list in August 2011. In 1996, the novel earned the RITA Award for \\"Best Short Historical\\", a prize given annually by the Romance Writers of America. It also won the 1996 \\"Regency Historical Romance\\" award, granted by the Romantic Times. In a review by that publication, M. Helfer praised Chase for being \\"an exquisite storyteller who creates sharply original characters and moves them in new and exciting ways. One of the true treasures of the genre, she epitomizes the essence of excellence in every word she writes\\". Soon after its release, the book also won accolades from other award bodies, including \\"Best Historical Single Title Romance\\" by Romance Readers Anonymous and \\"Best Historical Romance\\" by Reader's Voice. In 2014, romance novelist Madeline Hunter recalled Lord of Scoundrels being \\"the 'must read' of the season\\" when it was published in 1995, and described it as \\"witty, heartfelt, with a flawed hero and an indomitable heroine, [and with] pacing so perfect a reader could only hold on for the ride. It was no surprise that a book that pushed so many peoples' happy buttons ended up winning a RITA that year. I think there would have been a revolt if it had not\\". The novel's popularity has endured and it is still considered one of the best historical romances ever published. The website \\"All about Romance\\" voted it in first place for four years, and it was also deemed the \\"Best All-Time Historical Romance\\" by Romance Readers Anonymous for four years. In a 2010 list of \\"must-reads in romance\\" for Kirkus Reviews, Sarah Wendell deemed it her favorite historical romance and believed her successful recommendation to a male professor proved its worth. Author Anne Browning Walker, in a similar list of \\"Smart Romance Books\\" for Publishers Weekly, included Lord of Scoundrels and observed Chase's penchant for \\"creating smart, thoughtful, witty, and well-meaning heroines\\". Also writing for Publishers Weekly, author Beverly Jenkins called Lord of Scoundrels an example of \\"Chase at the top of her game\\" and opined that its \\"characters are full-bodied and evenly matched. The passion is to die for, and every romance reader I know has this book on their keeper shelf\\". Elissa Petruzzi of RT Book Reviews wrote in 2014, \\"Some consider Loretta Chase‚Äôs epic tale to be the best Regency ever written\\". Novelist Eloisa James recommended Lord of Scoundrels for readers interested in trying historical romance for the first time, saying the novel is \\"just brilliant, hysterically funny, sexy dialogue\\". Chase herself has expressed surprise at the novel's enduring popularity, writing that she \\"saw no indication it would become such a reader favorite\\".

The Ritz' financial backers began negotiations in 1901 and purchased the Bath in 1902 simultaneously with the acquisition of the Walsingham. One of the considerations that made the transaction appealing to the city was that they would be able to widen Piccadilly when the Walsingham and Bath Hotels were demolished. History Located on the corner of Arlington Street and Piccadilly the hotel was in existence no later than the mid-1780s, since John Adams stayed there with his family when he served as the American Minister to Great Britain, starting in 1785. In 1789, an ad for a lost dog offered a reward for anyone who returned the dog to the Bath Hotel. The hotel was located on the site of the original building where the Old White Horse Cellar operated, and offered luxury hotel suites to its clients. In 1895 the property was offered for sale, indicating that there were profitable rents to be obtained from leaseholds of the booking agent and the wine and spirit retailer on the premises. It is mentioned in the classic novel, Little Women by Louisa May Alcott. The building was demolished in 1904.

She served as regent for her son in his minority and for a short period afterward in the interregnum period when the royal succession of Mangareva was in doubt.  Biography  Maria Eutokia was the second wife of King Gregorio I Maputeoa. Christianity was introduced to the Gambier Islands in her lifetime by French Picpus priests, Honor√© Laval and Fran√ßois Caret with the support of her husband Maputeoa and his uncle Matua, the high priest. She was baptized with the name Maria Eutokia after her conversion to the new faith. Maria Eutokia and Maputeoa had five children, two sons and three daughters, which survived infancy. The royal couple's five children include the eldest surviving son Joseph Gregorio II, a second son named Jean N√©pomuc√®ne after Saint John of Nepomuk, and three daughters: Agn√®s Tepairu, Philom√®le, and Catherine, two of these girls became nuns in the Rouru Convent on Mount Duff. In 1857, Maputeoa died and Joseph Gregorio became king at the age of ten. Because of his minority, Queen Maria Eutokia assumed the regency for the young monarch. Considered a sickly child, Joseph Gregorio died on 21 November 1868 without leaving issue. Because the throne of Mangareva could only pass to a male heir, another regency was installed with Maria Eutokia at the head pending the birth of a male heir from one of Maputeoa and Maria Eutokia's two surviving daughters. At the time, other factions in the kingdom were in support of ending the monarchy and either becoming a Republic or a theocracy under the guidance of Father Honor√© Laval and the French mission. Queen Maria Eutokia relied on the advice and counsel of Father Laval just as over a decade earlier, Queen P≈çmare IV of Tahiti looked to British consul and missionary George Pritchard.Scott, L., \\"French Aggressions in the Pacific\\", The Foreign Quarterly Review, Vol. 34, 1844 The ruins of Rouru Convent, where Queen Maria Eutokia retired to in later life as a novice After serving as Queen Regent for another year, Maria Eutokia retired and entered the Rouru Convent on Mount Duff becoming a novice in her later life. Akakio Tematereikura, a cousin of Maputeoa's and son of his uncle Matua, succeeded as regent. However, because Akakio predeceased Maria Eutokia by three days, she was responsible for choosing the next regent for Mangareva. She considered choosing Father Laval as the new regent and turu (guardian) of her two surviving daughter Agn√®s and Philom√®le but Laval refused the offer. Instead, Aarona, a paternal uncle of her children, was chosen to succeed as regent and another chief Bernardo Putairi became the guardian and tutor of the two girls. Maria Eutokia died shortly afterward on 27 August 1869. Her eldest daughter Agn√®s died on November 1873 and Philom√®le, considered an idiot, blind and a hunchback, died before 1881. After the demise of most of the royal family (togo ªiti), the Gambier Islands steadily fell under colonial influence, becoming a French protectorate in 1871 and fully annexed to the territory of French Oceania in 1881, today part of the overseas country of French Polynesia.

Built in 1847, it is one of Penobscot County's few examples of Gothic Revival architecture. The house was built by Daniel Sargent, one of the major lumber barons of the Penobscot area in the mid-19th century. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. Description and history The Sargent House stands at the southwest corner of South Main Street (Maine State Route 15) and Town Landing Road in far southwestern Brewer. It is a large 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a main roof line running east-west and cruciform gables (two south, one north) projecting from each side. The gable ends are all decorated with a distinctive vine-like vergeboard. A square tower rises at the northeast corner of the eastern and northern gables, capped by a steeply-pitched pyramidal roof with a finial at the top. A lower octagonal turret stands at the southeast corner. A single- story porch, now enclosed, stands between the southern gables. The house was built in 1847 by Daniel Sargent, owner of a shipyard and lumber mill. Sargent was one of the area's preeminent \\"lumber barons\\", whose business dominated the Brewer-Bangor area. The house is a high quality and relatively little-altered example of the Gothic Revival, of which only three examples are known in the county. The alterations include the removal of a porch front the front (which was similar in style to that on the south side), and the addition of the square tower, probably in the 1880s or 1890s.

She is married to Victor, a successful painter. To celebrate the sale of one of his paintings to a museum, Victor decides to rent a house for the summer where he can paint. Sara is annoyed at his plan because she wanted to spend the summer in the city researching a paper she is writing on ecstatic experiences and knows that her access to books will be limited in a small town. She feels as though Victor doesn't value her work in academia compared to his work as an artist. Nevertheless, after finding a house they both adore she agrees to go with him for the summer. At the rented house Victor becomes obsessed with painting local women, befriending one in particular, a Puerto Rican woman named Celia. Jealous, Sara goes back to the city for a few days to act in a student film that one of her students has begged her to participate in. She meets Duke, the filmmaker's uncle, who plays her love interest in the movie and who is immediately attracted to her. Sara brings Duke up to the rented house, and Victor is immediately jealous of him. Victor is also jealous when his friend and mentor Carlos starts flirting with Celia. In the morning, seeing Victor aggressively playing around with Celia, Sara grows angry and tells him to stop his flirting in front of her. Leaving him, she talks to her mother saying she feels out of control and on shaky ground, despite being known for her steady, contemplative nature. Returning to the city, Sara completes her final scenes for the film.

Arkansas, 1890 - d. Michigan, April 28, 1960) was a master bamboo fly rod maker, fly tyer and fly fishing innovator. The work of Paul Young is greatly admired by anglers and collectors today.  Early life  Paul Young was born in Cherry Valley, Arkansas. He fished as a child in the Mississippi River and the Ozarks. He was a hunter and taxidermist and graduated from the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville in 1912. He traveled throughout the U.S. and Canada fishing and hunting.Schwiebert, Ernest (1984). Trout. New York, New York: E.P. Dutton. Shortly after marrying Martha Marie in 1921, he moved to Detroit, Michigan, and three years later, opened a fishing tackle store there. It became a popular destination for serious fly fisherman of the mid-west.  Fly Rod Developments  Paul Young was one of the most experimental craftsmen in rodmaking. He was a restless artisan who pushed the boundaries of fly rod design, although he made a relatively limited number for his time.  Restless Artisan  It has been said that Young was not as interested in the aesthetics of a fly rod as much as he was in lightweight and functionality. One example was the deliberate use of two differently-tapered tip sections to give the angler two different casting actions in one outfit. He used a specially shaped grip with an impression for the caster's thumb. This idea had been used many years earlier by Granger. His use of a \\"ventilated grip\\" (already used by Wes Jordan for his South Bend fly rods,http://fishinghistory.blogspot.com/2008/04/get-grip-south-bend-paul- young-and.html which left spaces between the cork rings for a skeletal appearance), aluminum for his reel seats and ferrules. His desire to shed as much weight as possible from a fly rod created an aesthetic all its own. The Paul H. Young Company outsourced fishing rod construction to companies: Heddon, South Bend Bait Company and E.W. Edwards.Garner, Patrick C. (2009). Playing With Fire, The Life and Fly Rods of E.W. Edwards. Cincinnati, Ohio: Whitefish Press.  Ring of Fire  Young developed a ringed gas jet to heat temper the bamboo for his rods. This \\"ring of fire\\" gave his rods a greater power to weight ratio and the rich, flamed appearance that was signature to his designs. He used a surplus military bomb hoist to construct a bamboo binder and was greatly assisted by August Pernack, who set up the milling machine and also developed a ferrule-making operation.  The 'Para' Paradigm  Young's signature tapers (measured diameter of a rod, determining its performance characteristics) were known as parabolic, a term coined by Everett Garrison, a rodmaker who used the term to describe a prototype fly rod made by Charles Ritz and were more radical than other contemporary designs of its type.Garrison, Everett and Carmichael, Hoagy B. (1997). A Master's Guide To Building A Bamboo Fly Rod. Far Hills, New Jersey: Meadow Run Press. Paul Young was most famous for his 'Midge', a four weight rod measuring six feet, three inches. Originally intended for the challenging, light-tackle needs of sophisticated chalk-stream fly fisherman, the 'Midge' rod was put to uses its creator never intended, such as landing Atlantic Salmon.McClane, A.J. (1974). McClane's New Standard Fishing Encyclopedia. New York, Chicago, San Francisco: Holt, Rinehart and Winston Arnold Gingrich said in his The Joys of Trout: \\"He was venerated in the last decade of his life as \\"the Stradivari of the Midge rod\\", and died enjoying near-legendary status as a cult figure.\\"Gingrich, Arnold (1973).

Pre-fight career Francisco Bejines made his professional boxing debut on September 16, 1977, against undefeated (2‚Äì0) Rodolfo Quintero at the Arena Coliseo in Guadalajara. He outpointed his rival over eight rounds. His very next fight was his first ten round test, as he battled undefeated (7‚Äì0‚Äì1) Miguel Navarro, who knocked Bejines out in round eight on October 21 of the same year, also at the Arena Coliseo. On November 25, only one month and four days after his first loss, Bejines was back in a ring as a professional, facing David Vera (6‚Äì3). Bejines scored his first professional knockout win when he beat Vera in round eight of a scheduled ten rounds. Bejines' first 1978 bout took place on February 17 at the Arena Coliseo when he took on 1‚Äì4 Anastacio Chavez, beating Chavez by ten round decision. Six months later, he faced undefeated Rosendo Alonso, 6‚Äì0‚Äì1 coming in, and lost to him by ten round decision on August 11. On September 8, Bejines returned to the winning column, notching a ten round points victory against Agustin Macias, 5‚Äì2 coming in. Bejines' last fight in 1978 was a rematch with Rodolfo Quintero, who by then had a record of 2‚Äì2, and who was again beaten by Bejines, this time by decision over ten rounds, on November 3. 1979 proved to be, boxing-wise, a busy year for Bejines, as he fought nine times, beginning with a February 2 fifth round knockout of undefeated but also inexperienced (1‚Äì0) Lupe Torres; a March 16 technical decision loss to Manuel Luna (2‚Äì5) in what constituted a small upset when a clash of heads in round six left Luna, who was winning the bout on the judges scorecards, unable to continue; a June 8 second round knockout win against debuting Jorge Martinez; a June 22 first round knockout win versus the also debuting Jesus Garcia; a July 13 third round knockout win against 0‚Äì1 Victor Hernandez; a step-up in class to face 22‚Äì10 boxing veteran Francisco Javier Nunez-whom he beat by three round technical decision August 10 when Nunez slipped to the canvas and sustained a dangerous cut, not being able to continue and Bejines winning the Jalisco state Bantamweight championship; a first round knockout on October 12 of 5‚Äì4 Jorge Manuel Vera; a November 16 fight against 0‚Äì1 Leonardo Martinez; beaten by knockout in two, and Bejines' first defense of the Jalisco state Bantamweight title, when he lost by a twelve round decision in a rematch with 15‚Äì3‚Äì1 Rosendo Alonso, on December 14. Bejines had a less busy year in 1980. Nevertheless, he still fought seven times that year, including twice in a seven-day span and twice in a six-day one. On May 24, he faced 5‚Äì6‚Äì1 Hector Cortes, winning by a ten round decision. On June 26, he followed that victory with a losing effort; this time against 3‚Äì4 Ramiro Garcia in a minor upset, in what was his first fight outside Guadalajara, the bout being held at Uruapan, Michoacan de Ocampo. Three months and a half later, on October 4, Bejines fought Fabian Palma, 4‚Äì7‚Äì2 coming in, and knocked him out in round one in what was Bejines' Mexico City debut. Seven days later, on October 11, Bejines boxed world ranked Ecuadorian Hector Cortez (no relation to Bejines' earlier rival on the same year), 30‚Äì6‚Äì3, winning by first round knockout which made him ranked among the world's top ten Bantamweights by the WBC. On November 16, Bejines re-matched Leonardo Martinez, now 0‚Äì2, and beat him by a second round knockout, and on November 22, he beat 8‚Äì3 Freddy Martinez by a third round knockout before making his debut abroad, his first fight in the United States, against future Jeff Chandler beater and world title challenger Oscar Muniz, who outpointed Bejines over ten rounds on December 11 at the Olympic Auditorium, in Los Angeles, California. 1981 saw Bejines fight Jose Resendez, 13‚Äì17‚Äì1, beaten on points in ten rounds on January 22 at the Olympic Auditorium; 2‚Äì3 Gilberto Villacana, knocked out in three rounds on February 22 at Houston, Texas; 12‚Äì6‚Äì4 Franco Torregrosa, outpointed over ten rounds on March 19 at the Olympic Auditorium; 2‚Äì12‚Äì1 Calvin Sheppard, beaten by unanimous ten round decision on August 1 at the Olympic Auditorium; undefeated (9‚Äì0) Adriano Arreola, who'd' later last ten rounds against Julio C√©sar Ch√°vez and beat Lupe Pintor-and whom Bejines defeated by six round knockout on August 20 at the Inglewood Forum; 2‚Äì4‚Äì1 Ruben Solorio, defeated by Bejines by way of a ten round decision on October 1 at the Olympic Auditorium, and 22‚Äì2, former WBA and Ring Magazine world Bantamweight champion, Puerto Rican Julian Sol√≠s, who was dropped four times by Bejines before Bejines prevailed by a seventh round technical knockout, also at the Olympic Auditorium. By then, Bejines was well known and popular among boxing audiences in the United States' southwest as well. Bejines continued his rise on the WBC's Bantamweight rankings during 1982, meeting and defeating several ranked fighters and losing only to one, including Javier Flores, 25‚Äì12‚Äì3, beaten by seventh round knockout on January 20 at the Olympic Auditorium, Venezuelan Jovito Rengifo-who later in the year challenged Lupe Pintor for the WBC world title-whom Bejines outpointed over ten rounds at the Olympic Auditorium on March 5, recent Pintor challenger Hurricane Teru, who had gone fifteen rounds with Pintor before getting knocked out in another world title fight; taken out in four rounds by Bejines June 3 at the Olympic Auditorium, and another Venezuelan, Edgar Roman, who in 1984 would challenge Richie Sandoval for his WBA world Bantamweight title and who beat Bejines by a fifth round knockout on August 12 at the Olympic Auditorium. World title fight On the wake of the death of South Korean boxer Duk Koo Kim, who died five days after challenging Ray Mancini for the latter's WBA world Lightweight title, the WBC voted to have its world title fights reduced in distance from 15 rounds to 12, effective 1983. The first world title fight with the reduced distance as scheduled was between WBC Junior Bantamweight champion Rafael Orono of Venezuela and Pedro Romero, Orono retaining the title by a fourth round knockout. Meanwhile, WBC world Bantamweight champion Lupe Pintor suffered a vehicular accident and was sidelined by injury. The WBC then ordered Bejines and Alberto Davila to fight for the WBC's vacant interim world title, in a twelve round bout to take place September 1, 1983. The fight's referee was the experienced Puerto Rican of German descent, Waldemar Schmidt. Bejines and Davila boxed for eleven rounds without landing particularly hard punches. Bejines was leading on two of the three judges scorecards before the final round began. About 25 seconds into the round, Davila, realizing he was behind on the scorecards, landed a left jab which stunned Bejines, followed by a hard right to the chin which dropped Bejines, who hit his head against the lower rope. Bejines tried to get up, but referee Schmidt stopped the bout. After the fight Ringside physicians tried to revive Bejines, but he did not respond to treatment. He was then taken to California Hospital, from where he was airlifted to Los Angeles County-University of Southern California Medical Center, where several attempts were made at saving his life the following days, including the removal of part of his brain and skull and of a blood clot to try to diminish his brain pressure. Bejines was held on a respirator machine until he died on September 4. Bejines' death was the first in professional boxing since Kim's; it was also the first involving a boxer after a fight at the Olympic Auditorium since Johnny Owen's after his unsuccessful challenge of Pintor in 1980. Davila was later named full champion by the WBC once Pintor decided not to return to the Bantamweight division. The WBC, on the other part, was criticized for sanctioning this bout, especially since Bejines had lost his prior fight. Bejines had a record of 27 wins and 8 losses in 35 bouts, 16 wins by knockout. Personal Bejines' wife was pregnant with his baby when he died. His brother, Oscar Bejines, was also a professional boxer of note during the 1980s and 1990s.

Although not officially named, it was often referred to as the Great Eastern Express, Kalgoorlie Express or Kalgoorlie Passenger. Following the opening of the Trans-Australian Railway in October 1917, its importance increased with the commencement of the Trans- Australian Express from Port Augusta in South Australia. By May 1921, a separate overnight express (later named The Westland) for interstate passengers and mail was introduced and it became the connecting train with the Trans-Australian Express. The existing service remained to service intrastate passengers and was named The Kalgoorlie on 3 December 1962. Following the conversion of the Eastern and Eastern Goldfields lines to standard gauge, The Kalgoorlie was scheduled to be replaced by The Prospector. However delays in delivery of new rolling stock saw the existing narrow gauge service continue. As it was the only narrow gauge train traversing the Northam to Merredin section of the Eastern line, it was diverted via Wyalkatchem in October 1970 to allow the old line to close.

It was not recognized during Soviet era, but in recent decades the issue became an important topic of discussion in Ukrainian society and among academic scholars. Current situation Nuzhat Ehsan, UN Population Fund representative in Ukraine, stated in February 2013 ‚ÄúUkraine really has an unacceptable level of violence, mainly by men and mainly due to high level of alcohol consumption‚Äù. He also blamed loopholes in the legislation contribute to the problem of domestic violence, ‚ÄúYou can violate women and still if you are a high-level official or from a high-level official family, you can get away with it‚Äù. In the view of traditional morale norms the Ukrainian women are supposed \\"to be beautiful and to be a mother\\". Moreover, the gender traditions in Ukraine tend to restrict women from holding positions of political power, while standards of male behaviour include being protective of women. The ongoing War in Donbass in Ukraine's Donbass region is believed to have reinforced the separation of gender responsibilities. But the UN reports the Ukrainian women living in the conflict zone are at significant risk due to weak law enforcement, high concentration of military groups and proliferation of weapons. In 2015 the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights expressed a deep concern about rapidly worsening situation with violence against women in Ukraine.OHCHR publishes alarming report on increased violence against women in Ukraine (2 March 2015) According to the estimation of OSCE the violence towards women is widespread in Ukraine and it is associated with three times more deaths than the ongoing War in Donbass in the Donbass region of Ukraine.The OSCE draws attention to violence against women in Ukraine (7 March 2018) History and extent According to latest UN Report around 45 percent of Ukraine‚Äôs population (45 million) suffers violence ‚Äì physical, sexual or mental ‚Äì and most of them are women.Kyivans join global rally to end violence against women, Kyiv Post (14 February 2013) From the historical point of view the problem of violence against women in Ukraine was always surrounded by silence. There are not too many sources of official statistics to estimate how deep the problem is. This fact also brings understanding that the mass media is unsure how to approach the issue, the authorities do not know how to deal with the manifestations of the violence and the nation doesn't know how to mobilize the public to end the violence. As a result all national anti- violence efforts rely on considerable support from Western donors A few available statistics indicate that the violence inherent in the poverty where most part of Ukrainian women live. The recorded data also demonstrate that the observed value is just a minor fraction of a real figure due to a combined influence of traditions and personal shame. Domestic violence In Ukraine domestic violence towards women has a long history. There are evidences that the model of male aggressiveness directed towards women is transferred from generation to generation. Recent studies reveal that violence against women is not limited to any particular segment of the Ukrainian population and occurs across all social layers. There are not many Ukrainian women who have achieved economic independence and own their own home. According to recent research violence against women remains a hidden problem, but it is clear that the ongoing War in Donbass in Ukraine leads to an increase in its prevalence. In early 2020 there were barely any women's shelters in Ukraine. Sexual exploitation The sexual exploitation of women is also a broad and serious problem in Ukrainian society. This issue consists of women's trafficking on the transnational markets and coercive prostitution. It comes up as a result of many factors including the impoverishment of significant part of population, soft pornography widely used by Ukrainian mass media to catch an attention of customers, and so on. Statistical data reported by NGOs state that up to one third of young jobless Ukrainian women have been involved to some degree in illegal sex business activities. Violence against children A survey of young Ukrainian girls performed by All-Ukrainian Committee for the Protection of Children reveals that a sexual abuse of them accounts for high proportion of the abuse victims. For example, it was reported that one Ukrainian girl out of three had experienced sexual harassment, one out of five had suffered physical sexual abuse, one out of ten had been raped. Criminal statistics reports that 55% of registered sexual assaults in Ukraine are directed towards youth under 18, and 40% of them or 22% in total - towards children under 14 . Legal base In February 2019 domestic violence was made a criminal offense in Ukraine meaning perpetrators could be fined, or sentenced to community service or a prison sentence. Previously perpetrators could be subjected to a maximum of administrative punishment. Where they will not find, The Ukrainian Week, (16 February 2020) According to The Ukrainian Week about 5% of victims report violence to the Ukrainian police.

The opera premiered at the Teatro San Salvador in Venice on 13 December 1674. Background and performance history Little is known about the opera's librettist, Tebaldo Fattorini, apart from the fact that he came from a prominent family in Chioggia and was employed as a \\"house poet\\" for the Teatro San Salvador in Venice. In addition to writing Eteocle e Polinice, he also significantly revised Nicol√≤ Minato's libretto for a new version of Cavalli's Scipione africano in 1677 and may also have revised Giovanni Giovannini's original libretto for its setting by Legrenzi as Adone in Cipro in 1675. The libretto for the premiere performances of Eteocle e Polinice at the Teatro San Salvador in 1674 was dedicated of the \\"most noble ladies of Venice\\" (\\"Consacrato alle nobilissime dame di Venetia\\"). Subsequent productions of the opera with new dedications were staged in Naples (1689), Milan (1684), and Modena (1690). The opera consists of a total of 101 musical pieces, including arias, duets, quartets, etc. Its most well known aria, \\"Che fiero costume\\" (also known by its English title, \\"How void of compassion\\"), has been recorded by several well known opera singers, including Luciano Pavarotti, Ezio Pinza, and Richard Tucker. A manuscript score from the 1689 Neapolitan production has survived. Richard Strauss made specific reference to this opera in Die schweigsame Frau, recomposing \\"Dolce Amor\\" as a duet which is sung in the course of the music lesson scene in act 3, as one of many such reappropriations of preexisting music Strauss used to create an \\"antique\\" atmosphere.

It ended with the principal characters all dying tragically through murder, suicide, or grief. However, Tebaldo Fattorini's libretto has a happy ending in which Antigone is reunited with Tideo, Prince of Aetolia, and Eteocle is reunited with the warrior-princess Deifile. The victorious Adrasto, the King of Argos who had been the ally of Polynices, supervises the return to peace and harmony.

The actual period of this Vevu is unknown, however sandstone used in construction is evidence pointing to the pre-Islamic period (500BCE-1153AD). The symmetry of the two wells also suggest it may have been part of a temple. These types of baths are found in other parts of Maldives. Coral stone is also seen in some of the baths and mosques. This supports the theory that the Vevu was built earlier than most coral stone mosques. Vevu are constructed by layering sandstone blocks approximately a meter below the water line till about half a meter above ground. There is an octagonal ledge cantilevered at low tide level for people to access the well. According to recorded history, Maamigili has been uninhabited for at least 200 years and during this time the Vevu has been damaged by natural and human interference, yet still it is considered a fine example of a pre-Islamic coralstone structure.

He played college football at the University of Georgia. His uncle is former Cowboys player and Broncos coach Dan Reeves. High school career Andrews attended Wesleyan School in Peachtree Corners, Georgia, where he was a two-way lineman. In his sophomore year, Wesleyan won the 2008 GHSA Class A state championship. For his junior and senior seasons, his coaches attributed him with over a hundred knockdown blocks while not allowing a quarterback sack. Andrews was named 2010 Gwinnett County Offensive Lineman of the Year and made the All-County First Team Offense of the Gwinnett Daily Post. Regarded as a three-star recruit by Rivals.com, Andrews was ranked as the No. 9 center prospect in the class of 2011, which was headed by Reese Dismukes. Andrews had offers from Duke and Michigan but, as a ‚Äúlifelong die-hard Bulldogs fan,‚Äù waited for Georgia to offer and committed ‚Äúpractically on the spot‚Äù when he got the offer in February 2010. College career In his true freshman season at Georgia, Andrews appeared in ten games. He earned Athletic Director's Honor Roll distinction for fall semester. In his sophomore year, Andrews filled the void left at center by the graduation of Ben Jones. Andrews started all 14 games, helping to protect quarterback Aaron Murray. After the Auburn game in early November, he was named SEC Offensive Lineman of the Week as he graded out at 88 percent and had six ‚Äúdominator‚Äù blocks and three knockdowns. As a junior, Andrews was named to the preseason watch list for the Rimington Trophy. He started all 13 games at center and protected quarterback Murray such that Georgia ranked second in passing in the SEC. At the conclusion of spring practice of his senior year, he was named Offensive MVP, and also preseason Third Team All-SEC by Phil Steele. Andrews added another 13 starts in as many games over his senior season, totaling 50 games for his college career. He won Georgia's Vince Dooley Most Valuable Player Award, was selected second-team All-SEC by the Associated Press, and was named one of six finalists for the Rimington Trophy. Professional career Andrews went undrafted in the 2015 NFL Draft, but signed with the New England Patriots as a free agent on May 8, 2015. He stood out at Patriot training camp and played more than expected in preseason, starting every preseason game due to injuries to starting center Bryan Stork and reserve center/guard Ryan Wendell. Andrews made the Patriots 2015 53-man roster and started at center in Week 1 against the Pittsburgh Steelers after Stork was placed on injured reserve with the designation to return and Wendell was inactive. Andrews started every game through Week 10, playing every snap over the first half of the season. Although he was not selected to the 2016 Pro Bowl, Andrews finished in the top two in fan voting at the position. As a result of his high snap count and low salary, Andrews received a performance-based pay bonus of $237,427.11, the second-highest of any Patriot in 2015 (after cornerback Malcolm Butler). In 2016, Andrews faced competition from Bryan Stork for the starting center job and ultimately won, leading to Stork's release from the team. He started all 16 regular-season games for the Patriots on an offensive line that led the team to a 14‚Äì2 record. Andrews started in Super Bowl LI against the Atlanta Falcons in the first overtime game and largest comeback in Super Bowl history; the Patriots trailed 28‚Äì3 late in the third quarter, but rallied to win by a score of 34‚Äì28. On May 12, 2017, Andrews signed a three-year contract extension with the Patriots through the 2020 season. The deal has a base value of $9.6 million, with a $1.6 million signing bonus, and an additional $2.1 million in incentives. On September 5, 2017, Andrews was named a Patriots captain for the first time in his career. Andrews started 17 of 19 games for the Patriots, including their Super Bowl LII loss to the Philadelphia Eagles. Andrews once again started all 16 games at center for the Patriots in 2018. Andrews helped the Patriots reach their third straight Super Bowl appearance after they defeated the Los Angeles Chargers and Kansas City Chiefs in the playoffs; they defeated the Los Angeles Rams by a score of 13‚Äì3 in Super Bowl LIII. Andrews had a fumble recovery in the victory. On August 26, 2019, it was revealed that Andrews was diagnosed with a pulmonary embolism, putting his 2019 season in jeopardy. He was placed on season-ending injured reserve on August 31, 2019. Andrews returned to the Patriots starting lineup in 2020 after missing all of 2019. On September 26, 2020, he was placed on injured reserve after undergoing surgery on his thumb.

It was built in 1865. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 28 May 2004.  History  The Heiner Road railway overpass was probably constructed in 1864 over the Main Line railway that connected the government wharf on the Bremer River with the North Ipswich railway workshop site. It consists of a modern bridge over substantial stone abutments that are a rare survivor of the earliest railway infrastructure in Queensland and evidence for the way in which the railway network was established. A reliable transport network was essential to allow the development of the colony of Queensland and the transport of settlers, goods and raw materials. It is very rare for a first railway to start from a provincial town, rather than the capital and the fact that it did reflects the early history of European settlement. The first settlement in Moreton Bay had been a penal colony, established in 1824. By 1842, the colony had closed and the area was thrown open for free settlement, though two years before this, squatters had arrived on the Darling Downs and had moved sheep, wool and supplies overland to Sydney, rather than to Brisbane, as it was then was closed to civilian traffic. Ipswich, at first called Limestone, was first used by the penal colony as a source of lime for building. Being on a navigable river, the Bremer, when free settlement began, it soon developed into a thriving trading centre. By 1843, the Moreton Bay region was represented in the New South Wales Parliament and questions concerning the development of the area raised the importance of transport. In 1856, a route from the Darling Downs to Brisbane through Ipswich was surveyed. Planning continued, but in 1859, the long sought separation of Queensland from New South Wales was proclaimed. Elections for the Queensland Legislative Assembly were held in 1860 and a Select Committee appointed to look into transport. By 1845 the Bremer had a regular river trade but could not take large vessels. Bridges and roads were few and subject to the vagaries of the weather. At the time however, the provision of a rail system was normally considered the province of private enterprise. Following a failed private scheme to set up a horse- drawn tramway, the Queensland Government stepped in. The first Railway Bill was presented in August 1863. There was heated debate about the cost, route and construction of the proposed line. Economy was necessary as the population was small and unlikely to make a railway immediately profitable. Moreover, the terrain over the main range to the Downs was difficult. Abram Fitzgibbon, an Irish engineer with international experience in railway construction, was engaged and recommended a narrow gauge track to allow economic construction. This too was controversial but was accepted. The Queensland railway was the first in the world to be constructed as a government enterprise. Surveys for the first section of line between Ipswich and Bigge's Camp were completed by the end of 1863. It was decided to run the line from Ipswich to the Darling Downs because Ipswich was already accessible by water. Tenders were called at the end of 1863 and that of Peto, Brassey and Betts, a well-known British firm, was accepted. Most of the materials, including locomotives in knock-down form, were sent from Britain to Ipswich by river steamer and the first sod was turned at North Ipswich on 25 February 1864. The first consignment of materials arrived by steamer on 15 August 1864. A line was laid down to the wharf to receive consignments of materials and move them to a workshops site on level ground above. Public pressure for a bridge across the river resulted in a change of plan and the terminus was moved to South Ipswich in the business centre. A bridge was constructed to carry both road and rail and was just completed in time for the opening of the first section of rail to Grandchester on 31 July 1865. Following the principles used to keep costs down, most bridges on the first line and on subsequent lines were timber. The Bremer River Rail Bridge was the most important of four metal bridges and it, and the Heiner Road overpass had stone abutments in a similar style. The abutments of the bridge were later rebuilt and the bridge itself superseded, carrying road traffic only. The Wharf Line continued in importance until Ipswich was linked to Brisbane by rail in 1874, following which river traffic diminished in importance. The line was later extended to Hancock's sawmill and was in use for many years. The railway workshop activities soon outgrew the area near the overbridge and a new site for the North Ipswich Railway Workshops was chosen in 1884. Only the 1870s stores building remains on the original site. The importance of the Heiner Road overpass diminished considerably when the new David Trumpy Bridge across the Bremer was opened in 1965 and the (1865) road bridge was demolished, leaving only its abutments. The overbridge abutments have weathered considerably and some stone from the upper section is missing. The bridge itself has been replaced at least once and the current concrete and timber bridge does not extend across the full width of the abutments. It is now surfaced with gravel. The rail and sleepers of the wharf line were subject to replacement over the years and have been removed, as has the wharf.  Description  The overbridge abutments are situated on the north side of the Bremer River near the abutments of the 1865 Bremer River bridge and behind the early goods store (tarpaulin store), which was part of the first Railway Workshops at Ipswich. The overbridge carries a road, but the railway track that ran between the abutments has been removed. Traces of its route can still be discerned in some places by the presence of depressions formed under sleepers and hand forged spikes. The abutments are apart and are supported by flanking walls on each side. They are constructed of large coursed blocks of medium to coarse grained and pebbly sandstone with lime mortar. The stone has become considerably weathered, though traces of edge dressing can be seen on some blocks. Ponding and drips of poured lead are visible between and on the front surface of some blocks. The concrete bridge over the cutting is recent and is marked LXXXX (1990). It does not cover the full width of the abutments and is finished with plain timber handrails.  Heritage listing  Heiner Road Railway Overpass was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 28 May 2004 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Heiner Road Railway Overpass is important in illustrating a vital step in the development of Queensland when the first stage of the new colony's railway network was established, opening in 1865. The Wharf Line predated the construction of the main line between Ipswich and Grandchester. Because Ipswich was a river port and the majority of components for the railway were delivered by ship from Britain, the line connecting the government wharf with the workshops, where assembly took place, was laid first and was an essential part of the construction strategy. The plans for the substantial masonry abutments that carried the road connecting with the rail and road bridge over the Bremer River over this line survive and are evidence for the importance accorded to this overpass and to the inauguration of the transport network essential to develop the colony. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. It is a rare survivor of the earliest railway infrastructure in Queensland and is also one of the very few overpass abutments in Queensland carried out in stone.

It was built from 1887 to 1999. It is also known as Imperial Hotel. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992. The building has traded as the Jets Leagues Club since 1998.  History  The first hotel to operate on this site was the Unity Hotel which opened in 1880 run by William Frederick Larter. In 1883 James Cooper took over the hotel and in 1887 he changed the name to the Imperial Hotel and an article in the Queensland Times of 19 April 1887 announced that he was trading out of the \\"recently erected and furnished\\" Imperial Hotel, on the corner of Downs and Lowry Streets, North Ipswich. The competition from this new hotel seems to have led to the closure within a year of the Royal Engineer's Hotel on the corner of Downs Street and The Terrace, which had been operating since the mid 1860s. The Queensland Times of April 1888 reported the transfer of the lease to John Abbott, but by April 1889 the Queensland Times reported that the hotel was part of John Abbott's Estate, and on 3 August 1889 the Queensland Government Gazette announced that John Cooper had regained the licence. There was a push by Ipswich residents to close a number of hotels, as their numbers were then in excess of that allowable by legislation. John Cooper's Imperial Hotel was one of three that consequently lost their licences, as reported in the Queensland Times of 2 April 1891. However, in July 1891 there was an application by the National Workmen's Club for a club licence for the premises. Despite some reservations about whether the club had adequate control of the premises to satisfy the requirements for the licence, it was granted. The Government Gazette on 28 January 1904 announced the granting of a licence to Thomas Murray at the then-named Hotel Cecil. In 1904 the licensee was transferred to Thomas Murray, and in 1905 the licence passed to W Osborne. By 1911 it had passed to Alexander G Burnett, and in 1918 appears to have passed to his wife, Catherine. There has been a succession of licensees since this time. In 1998, the venue was acquired by the Ipswich Jets rugby league club, ceased operation as a hotel, and began trading as a licensed club, the Jets Leagues Club. In 1999 the hotel was expanded along the Lowry Street frontage which houses a new dining and poker machine area. The middle section of the building previously accommodated a drive through bottle shop and is now a dining courtyard. The exterior of the extension has been designed to replicate the exterior of the original hotel on a single storey level.  Description  The Hotel Cecil is a two storeyed rendered masonry hotel located on the corner of Down and Lowry Streets at North Ipswich. Built in 1887, the Hotel is constructed of brick with a rendered ruled ashlar finish with a continuous sill to the ground floor walls upon which semi circular headed openings with cement rendered architraves finish on plinth blocks. The main entry to the building is from Down Street through a large 6 panel timber door with sidelights and a semi headed fanlight decorated with leadlights that include the name 'Hotel Cecil 1887'and stained glass panels depicting native flora. There are additional entrances at the truncated corner of the building and two further along Lowry Street. The arched windows to the main bar areas at the main corner of the building comprise pairs of semi headed double hung windows with circular lights above. Verandahs on timber posts with cast iron valance extend over the footpath with balconies above to both street frontages. The balconies have timber posts with cast iron balustrade and brackets. Pairs of frenchlights with fanlights above open onto the balconies. Above the curved balcony roof the masonry walls are articulated by a cornice punctuated with pilasters in low relief the project above the coping on the parapet which conceals the corrugated iron roof. Centrally located on the parapet of each street frontage is a curved gable which bears the words HOTEL CECIL A.D. 1887 in raised lettering. The interior of the hotel has been recently renovated in a style that replicates details from the period in which the building was constructed. Surviving original interior elements on the ground floor level include the cornices, ceilings and roses, the cedar fireplace mantle and staircase and the walls to the stairhall. The upper floor is in a comparatively intact condition and contains much of its original layout and joinery. The rear verandah has been enclosed and the rear stair survives. The hotel was extended in 1915 with a skillion roof addition which included three windows to Lowry street. The recent extension has included the removal of the skillion roof and the extension of the building by several bays with a gable roof and verandah that then adjoins a single storey end wing with parapet. The end wing houses the bottle shop and new entrance to the hotel. These recent additions closely replicate the details of the original building.  Heritage listing  Hotel Cecil was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The former Hotel Cecil demonstrates the pattern of development in Ipswich in the 1880s when more substantial public buildings were replacing former more modest structures signifying the growth of Ipswich as a residential centre and its strength as an industrial and commercial centre. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The former Hotel Cecil demonstrates aesthetic significance as a mid-Victorian hotel with high streetscape value. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The hotel has special association with the local community as a place of social activity since its opening in 1887.

It was designed by Vincent Price and built in 1919. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  The Ipswich Railway Workshops War Memorial was unveiled on the 27 September 1919 by Queensland Governor, Sir Hamilton Goold-Adams. The stone memorial was designed by Queensland Railway architect Vincent Price and honours the 300 local men who left the workshops to serve in the First World War. In July 1915 a mass meeting of the Railway Workshop employees was held to consider what could be done to perpetuate the memory of their 300 fellow employees who had left to serve in the war. By the end of the war 28 of these men had been killed and 3 had died on service. At the meeting a committee was established to consider what form the memorial should take. It was decided to erect a monument and permission for its erection in the workshop grounds was gained from the Commissioner for Railways, Col. Barnard Charles Evans, CMG. The grandeur and comparatively high cost () of the monument is reflective of the patriotic spirit of the railway yard workers. The unveiling on Saturday 27 September 1919 was a public event involving approximately 160 returned soldiers who marched from the Ipswich railway station under the charge of Lieutenant C W King. They were escorted by a Military Band to the workshops where they formed a guard of honour for the Governor. Australia, and Queensland in particular, had few civic monuments before the First World War. The memorials erected in its wake became our first national monuments, recording the devastating impact of the war on a young nation. Australia lost 60,000 from a population of about 4 million, representing one in five of those who served. No previous or subsequent war has made such an impact on the nation. Even before the end of the war, memorials became a spontaneous and highly visible expression of national grief. To those who erected them, they were as sacred as grave sites, substitute graves for the Australians whose bodies lay in battlefield cemeteries in Europe and the Middle East. British policy decreed that the Empire war dead were to be buried where they fell. The word \\"cenotaph\\", commonly applied to war memorials at the time, literally means \\"empty tomb\\". Australian war memorials are distinctive in that they commemorate not only the dead. Australians were proud that their first great national army, unlike other belligerent armies, was composed entirely of volunteers, men worthy of honour whether or not they made the supreme sacrifice. Many memorials honour all who served from a locality, not just the dead, providing valuable evidence of community involvement in the war. Such evidence is not readily obtainable from military records, or from state or national listings, where names are categorised alphabetically or by military unit. Australian war memorials are also valuable evidence of imperial and national loyalties, at the time, not seen as conflicting; the skills of local stonemasons, metalworkers and architects; and of popular taste. In Queensland, the digger statue was the popular choice of memorial, whereas the obelisk predominated in the southern states, possibly a reflection of Queensland's larger working-class population and a lesser involvement of architects. Many of the First World War monuments have been updated to record local involvement in later conflicts, and some have fallen victim to unsympathetic re-location and repair. Although there are many different types of memorials in Queensland, the digger statue is the most common. It was the most popular choice of communities responsible for erecting the memorials, embodying the ANZAC spirit and representing the qualities of the ideal Australian: loyalty, courage, youth, innocence and masculinity. The digger was a phenomenon peculiar to Queensland, perhaps due to the fact that other states had followed Britain's lead and established Advisory Boards made up of architects and artists, prior to the erection of war memorials. The digger statue was not highly regarded by artists and architects who were involved in the design of relatively few Queensland memorials. Most statues were constructed by local masonry firms, although some were by artists or imported. The monument at Ipswich involved several makers and is an unusual example of the work of Queensland Railway architect, Vincent Price. Price was born in Brisbane in 1868 and began his architectural career articled to Richard Gailey. He established his own practice in Brisbane in 1890 but soon became a draftsman in the Chief Engineers Office of Queensland Railways. He remained with the railways until he retired in 1933, his last position being that of Principal Railway Architect. The digger statue is one of only two in Queensland designed by John Whitehead and Sons, sculptors of London. The pedestal was produced by A L Petrie and Sons of Toowong and the metal plates by Chas. Hanford of Brisbane. The masonry firm of A L Petrie and Son at Toowong was the largest monumental masonry works in Queensland at this time and were responsible for producing many of the state's First World War memorials.  Description  Railway Workshops War Memorial, Ipswich, 1925 The First World War Memorial is situated within the grounds of the North Ipswich Railway Workshops. It sits in a small grassed enclosure at the eastern end of the traverser, directly inside the main gate. The monument stands directly in front of a guyed flagstaff and is surrounded by a path which leads up to it. Large camphor laurel trees with circular seats are located nearby. The memorial stands from the ground and comprises a pedestal and obelisk surmounted by a digger statue. The granite and bronze memorial sits on a painted concrete stepped base, surrounded by two steps of kerbing. Surmounting the base is a Victorian granite pedestal with a bronze Coat of Arms on the front face. The pedestal is square in section and the front and rear faces display ornate bronze plaques with the Queensland Coat of Arms and the Queensland Railway Badge. The names of the 300 (approximately) men who left the works to fight for King and Empire in the European War are listed on the plaques with letters in columns after the names to indicate the 28 who were killed and the 3 who died on service. The plaques also bear the names of the 28 members of the memorial committee and trustees as well as historical inscriptions regarding the signing of the Armistice and Peace Treaty. The pedestal is capped by four triangular pediments which support a tall obelisk of Victorian granite. A bronze Coat of Arms is located on the front pediment and the dates of the First World War are in bronze on the front face of the base of the obelisk. Surmounting the obelisk is a digger statue, which at seven feet, is larger than life sized. The bronze statue portrays an Australian Infantry Soldier standing to attention with his rifle held upwards by his side.  Heritage listing  Ipswich Railway Workshops War Memorial was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. War Memorials are important in demonstrating the pattern of Queensland's history as they are representative of a recurrent theme that involved most communities throughout the state. They provide evidence of an era of widespread Australian patriotism and nationalism, particularly during and following the First World War. It is also an uncommon example of a monumental memorial erected in a workplace and is a historical record of the participation and sacrifice of a Queensland government agency. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. As a digger statue it is representative of the most popular form of memorial in Queensland, but is also unusual as one of only two bronze digger statues in the state supplied by a London sculptor. It is also an uncommon example of a monumental memorial erected in a workplace and is a historical record of the participation and sacrifice of a Queensland government agency. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The monuments manifest a unique documentary record and are demonstrative of popular taste in the inter-war period. Unveiled in 1919, the memorial at Ipswich Railway Workshops demonstrates the principal characteristics of a commemorative structure erected as an enduring record of a major historical event. This is achieved through use of appropriate materials and design elements. As a digger statue it is representative of the most popular form of memorial in Queensland, but is also unusual as one of only two bronze digger statues in the state supplied by a London sculptor. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The memorial is of aesthetic significance both for its design qualities and as a landmark within the railway precinct.

The tuhuna are not only adept at wood carving, but are also skilled at tattoo art and adze manufacture. Marquesan wooden crafts are considered among the finest in French Polynesia; they are highly sought after, and of consistently high quality, although weaving, basket-making, and pareu painting is more popular, especially among women artisans. Paul Gauguin noted the artistic sense of decoration of the Marquesas and appreciated the \\"unheard of sense of decoration\\" in their creative art forms. History Wooden figures from Marquesan prehistory can reveal much about the early practices of the local peoples. The popularity of Marquesaan wood carving was due to its increasing demand in foreign countries. This was also a consequence of the introduction of imported metal carving tools in the late 19th century. As a result, new styles emerged in wood carving such as decorating the full surface of an artifact with low-relief designs which had similarities to tattoo designs. This was done to meet the growing demand for souvenirs in the late 19th century. Wood cultivation Material used to make artifacts includes Oceania rosewood (Miro or Mi'o), oceania walnut (tou), iron wood (aito), the coconut tree (tumu ha'ari or tumu'ehi) as well as Pacific rosewood (Thespesia populnea) and temana (Calophyllum inophyllum); iron wood (Casuarina equisetifolia) is used to carve war clubs and other artifacts. Sandalwood was cleared out of the Marquesas between 1814 and 1817. It is important to the Marquesan people to use wood from the islands, because of its quality and it follows the tradition of their ancestors. Typically, the wood is dried for up for 10 years, and then treated against pests. While some craftsmen cultivate trees in their own gardens for their wood products, they also purchase it from vendors who grow it in the valleys. Products A display of wood carvings In 1961, the Anthropological Papers of the American Museum of Natural History documented that \\"the number of Historic period wooden figures collected in the Marquesas attests to the amount of wood carving for monumental purposes\\". Ua Huka is particularly well known in the area for its wood carvings. Common objects include sculptural representations of Polynesian gods, humans and animals, and utilitarian items such as decorated bowls, paddles, and clubs. Toewood and rosewood are featured in the wood carvings from Nuku Hiva, with bowls and spears made from the former, while tables and chessboards are carved from the latter. The tiki figurine, \\"an anthropomorphic figure portrayed with huge oval eyes, arching brows and open mouth\\", is typical of the Marquesan arts. Though tikis are most common as stone statues, they are also familiar motifs in wood carving and tattoos in the islands. Patterns used for both wood carving and body decorating have been noted, such as the honu kea (woodlouse), mata hoata (brilliant eye), ka'ake (underarm curve), poka'a (wood block), and enata (man).

He was a Cinnamon Press Poetry Award winner (2012) and his first book of poetry was A Force That Takes (Cinnamon Press, 2013). In 2007 he co-founded Dragon Phoenix Wine Consulting with his wife, the wine expert, Fongyee Walker, Master of Wine (MW). In 2010 he was the first foreigner to become an Associate Professor in the Department of Foreign Languages and Literatures (est. 1926) at Tsinghua University. In 2019 Ragg also became a Master of Wine (MW) as well as wine reviewer for Chinese wines for The Wine Advocate.  Early life and career  Ragg was born in Stockton-on-Tees, England and grew up in the Stockton and Billingham area. He was educated locally before winning academic and music scholarships to Oundle School (1988-1995). In 1994 Ragg won a scholarship to Keble College, Oxford where he completed a BA in English Language & Literature (with First Class Honours). His tutors included the poet Bernard O'Donoghue, Nigel Smith and Malcolm Parkes. In 1999 Ragg completed an MA in Publishing at Oxford Brookes University before being admitted to Selwyn College, Cambridge as a graduate scholar (1999-2005), completing an M.Phil. in American Literature and Ph.D. on the work of Wallace Stevens (1879-1955). This led to his major critical study Wallace Stevens and the Aesthetics of Abstraction (Cambridge University Press, 2010) which was awarded a Choice Reviews Outstanding Academic Title for 2011 and was praised by J. Hillis Miller for its 'brilliant close reading of difficult poems'. His first published poem appeared in the Cambridge May Anthology (2001 ed. Michael Donaghy) and, since 2004, he has published in international journals, anthologies and in book form. His poems 'Mutton Fat Jade' and 'Punctuation Points' were both prize- winners, respectively, at the 2009 and 2014 Troubadour International Poetry Prizes. During 2004-05 Ragg was a Fellow of the Rothermere American Institute, Oxford University, where he co-organised, with Bart Eeckhout, the first major British conference on the work of Wallace Stevens in celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the appearance of Stevens' Collected Poems, first published in England by Faber & Faber in 1955. In 2007 Ragg and his wife moved to Beijing, China and co-founded Dragon Phoenix Wine Consulting, an independent wine education and consultancy service. Around this time, Ragg's poems in response to contemporary China began to be translated into Mandarin by leading contemporary Chinese poet Wang Ao, who has also translated the work of Seamus Heaney, W. H. Auden, Hart Crane and Wallace Stevens. In 2010 Ragg was appointed an Associate Professor in the Department of Foreign Languages and Literatures (est. 1926), Tsinghua University, where he taught classes in literature and wine. He is also an Editorial Board Member of The Wallace Stevens Journal (est. 1977).. In 2017 he left Tsinghua University to focus on his writing and studies for the Master of Wine qualification. In 2019 Ragg became a Master of Wine.  Reception and criticism  A Force That Takes (2013) was reviewed by S. J. Holloway in Orbis Issue 167. Holloway observed: 'In reading this first collection, I made a common mistake: doing so in one sitting. Hence the spaces between each piece became blurred, leaving too little time for reflection and interpretation. And that‚Äôs exactly what this fine book demands. Not only do the poems need space between them, the reader is sometimes asked to pause between the stanzas or lines, so intricate and particular is the language'. Holloway concluded: 'If you give this work the space it needs, and the time it deserves, it will reward you greatly [‚Ä¶] Ragg allows the poet‚Äôs voice to carry its secrets, and sometimes, that is all we would want [...] It is meticulous, crafted poetry.' Leading American academic critic Charles Altieri also commented of the collection: 'Perhaps the most important feature of Ragg‚Äôs poetry is the movement of strong enjambment that carries a feeling of thought taking place. Thoughts arrive by traversing space and overcoming the resistance constantly of the poem for a moment being suspended before acts of thinking determine a path. This is a very important aspect of contemporaneity despite the lack of pretentious avant-garde status. I want to note the lovely intricacy of the idea of portraiture in ‚ÄòArriving on the Scene‚Äô and the great love poem ‚ÄòIf Only‚Äô that personalizes purpose and possibility.‚Äô Poet and reviewer Emma Lee concluded her review of A Force That Takes: 'Edward Ragg manages to combine the philosophical with personal observations without becoming didactic by a careful choice of words aimed at engaging the reader. His is an assured, undramatic voice that allows his poems to speak for themselves.' One of the poems from A Force That Takes, 'Anthem at Morning', was also selected for the prestigious 2014 Forward Book of Poetry chosen by judges Jeanette Winterson, Paul Farley, Sheenagh Pugh, the actor Samuel West and journalist David Mills from a pool of 161 other poetry collections published in the UK in 2013. Ragg's second collection Holding Unfailing (2017) was described by Sarah Howe as offering the reader '[i]ntriguing, supple poems that range across the world and across the landscapes of the mind.' The attention to place and landscape, especially in relation to contemporary China, was noted by Penelope Shuttle in her account of the book: 'This collection has for its central focus scenes from contemporary China, observing with detachment and direct emotional intent those personal landscapes which fan out from Ragg‚Äôs experiences of a country undergoing profound change. Such landscapes and the burdening memories accompanying them create poems of concentrated philosophical energy. They search and question. Ragg explores paths and places across a world shot through with colour. Yet he reins back from the expected celebratory note, in order to sift truth from falsehood, to travel from height to abyss. This is a wide-ranging and thought-provoking collection.' Exploring Rights (2020) is Ragg's third collection and represents greater formal experimentation than in the earlier work. Maureen N. McLane observes of the volume: 'Exploring Rights could not be more timely but is not only that: this book has the sustaining resonance of true works of art. This is formidably intelligent yet also tender and approachable poetry‚Äîa poetry of care, linguistic brio, philosophical range, sharp assessment, and occasionally savage indignation. Ragg modulates expertly between dispassionate attention and impassioned song. In Ragg ‚Äî an Auden for our moment ‚Äî delicate lyricism and discursive command co-exist. Exploring Rights registers our modernity and its human (and more-than-human) challenges, from Europe to China to the US to the Arctic. Ragg is a varied maker‚Äîa wizard of sampled documents, archival materials, legalese, spam, bots. Ranging from Catullus to Himmler to our era of surveillance, Ragg‚Äôs many- tongued verse shimmers with a complex intellectual and sensual music. Ragg tests his art on the most difficult yet urgent question: how and whether to pursue ‚Äòthe luxury of the poem‚Äô in these days.'https://www.waterstones.com/book/exploring-rights/edward- ragg//9781788640732 Penelope Shuttle also observed of Exploring Rights: 'This is a complex and intently-reasoned collection which addresses historic and contemporary issues with unflinching attention. There is mordant wit, formidable energy, and a relish for analysis of various appetites. A prevailing and chilling concentration is sustained throughout. These poems witness the urgency of recording and understanding our past and present human darknesses.'https://www.waterstones.com/book/exploring-rights/edward- ragg//9781788640732  Bibliography   Poetry: Books  Exploring Rights (Cinnamon Press, 2020) Holding Unfailing (Cinnamon Press, 2017) A Force That Takes (Cinnamon Press, 2013) ‚Äì Cinnamon Press Poetry Award winner (2012)  Poetry: Anthologies  2014 Forward Book of Poetry (London: Faber & Faber, 2013) - contributor Lung Jazz: Young British Poets for Oxfam ed.

The parish is part of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Birmingham and a part of the Rugby Deanery. The current Parish Priest is Fr. Michael Gamble. The parish is jointly administered with the neighbouring parish of Our Lady of the Sacred Heart, Bulkington (whilst still remaining technically separate). Working alongside the diocesan clergy are a group of Sisters of Providence of Saint Mary-of-the-Woods. Brief history The church was originally opened in June 1883. Casting a tentative shadow over Rye Piece, (a little side-street in the middle of the town), it was built at a time when Catholics were, unfortunately, still viewed with suspicion. It was a modest, oblong structure built in traditional Victorian redbrick with a small schoolroom running along the west side. The money to build it was raised by the priest, Fr Pius, not entirely from his sparse congregation but by simply begging all over the country. Funds for further development were supplemented by two long-running novenas dedicated to St Peter of Alcantara and St Francis Xavier. In 1894 a school was built close to the church. Originally big enough to accommodate some 150 pupils aged from 4 to 14 years, eventually it was superseded by a new school. It is now a nursery. The church itself was extended finally into its present form to be consecrated on 4 September 1923 and one of the hundreds of Catholic churches built following the Catholic Emancipation Act of 1829. A memorial to all the dedicated priests and parishioners of the past, particularly Fr Francis (1892 ‚Äì 1912). He was a legend in his own lifetime whose French background undoubtedly influenced the unique character of the church. He acquired land around the church to build the new school, the presbytery, to build social housing and he bought an old brewery to serve as a social club. So the Catholic community which had first congregated in a disused shop in one of Bedworth's many yards, then a small chapel, finally had its own church, yet with the sanctuary at the west end and opposite to the original. Today it is in need of repair and modernisation to conform to health and safety legislation. During its long life the church has survived wars and recession, the upheavals of Vatican II, town re-development and the ebb and flow of congregations and priests. Now it stands proudly and prominently, a Victorian gem on the busy Rye Piece ring road surrounded by beautiful gardens and enhanced by a Calvary and a grotto in honour of Our Lady of Lourdes.

They were built from 1847 to . They were also known as Australasian Steam Navigation Wharf and William Collins and Son Wharf, J & G Harris Wharf, and Walter Gray and Co Wharf. They were added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 31 July 2006.  History  Ipswich paddlesteamer at Ipswich wharves, 1870 The remnants of Ipswich Town Wharves are an archaeological site that contains visible remains of two wharves. Horizontal timbers extending from the riverbank, together with an associated stone wall are probably the remnants of the Australasian Steam Navigation Wharf (). Vertical piles projecting out of the river a short distance downstream are probably the remains of the J and G Harris landing (ca1862). The site was also the location of a wharf owned by Walter Gray & Co (1847 - ) and was used by William Collins and Son in the first part of the twentieth century. Archaeological deposits originating from the wharves also exist on the riverbed. Ipswich commenced as a convict outstation known as \\"Limestone\\" in 1827. After free settlement began in 1842, the township developed as an important regional centre because of its location at the head of navigation of the Brisbane and Bremer Rivers and at the junction of routes to the Brisbane Valley and the Darling Downs. Goods from these regions were channelled through Ipswich en route to the coast and this trade contributed significantly to Ipswich's rapid growth and prosperity. The people of Ipswich, together with the Darling Downs pastoralists wielded considerable political influence and agitated for Ipswich, rather than Brisbane, to be made the colony's capital. One of the key factors in favour of Ipswich was its role as an inland port. It was argued that goods could be shipped from Ipswich directly to Moreton Bay, by-passing Brisbane. There were sound practical reasons why this was a viable proposition. Poor road conditions meant that it was more convenient for the pastoralists to transport bulk goods from Ipswich to the coast along the Bremer and Brisbane Rivers using riverboats. This meant that goods had to be transferred from the riverboats to ocean-going vessels in Moreton Bay but this was necessary even for goods shipped from Brisbane because the Brisbane Bar prevented large vessels entering the river. A pastoralist, James Pearce, started the first steamer service from Ipswich in 1846 using the vessel, Experiment. In 1848, a committee of townspeople was formed to upgrade the Ipswich \\"landing place\\" to a proper wharf with improved road access. By the 1860s a wharf precinct had developed between the present location of the railway bridge and The Basin, a section of the Bremer River downstream from the town centre that was wide enough to permit steamers to turn. River trade peaked in the 1860s and 1870s, especially after Ipswich became the eastern rail terminus. In 1860, the Port of Moreton Bay was extended to Ipswich. At least six wharves lined the south bank of the Bremer between The Basin and the bridge. The wharves were linked to large stores built along the north side of Bremer Street. Bales of wool and cotton were slid down chutes to smaller wharf-side sheds. The wharf remnants presently located on the site were once among the largest and most important in the precinct. Walter Gray's wharf, which was located at Site One, was one of the first wharves to be established in the precinct. In 1847, Gray, a Scottish immigrant, occupied a block of land that extended from Bremer Street to the riverbank at Site One. He commenced business as a general storekeeper and agent trading in wool and other produce which he conveyed to Brisbane using Reid and Boyland's punts. His business reputedly became the largest mercantile house in the district operating extensive stores capable of holding several hundred bales of wool. Gray became a prominent member of the Ipswich community. He was treasurer of the committee of Ipswich businessmen that built the Ipswich town wharf in 1848. He supported establishing Cleveland as the colony's main port and, in the 1850s, together with other Ipswich businessmen, bought land and signified his intention to build jetties there where punts could load and unload cargoes. Gray promoted cotton cultivation and was a shareholder and director of the Ipswich Cotton Company. In 1860 when the Port of Moreton Bay was extended to Ipswich, his facilities were licensed as the bonded store where dutiable goods could be stored. In 1856, a surveyor described the wharf as \\"not a properly built wharf, but more of an earth bank\\". Associated facilities included a shed enclosed on one side with bark near the river, a slab and shingle wool store higher up the bank, a wooden slide down to the wharf from the store, and a road \\"cut into the bank and made with stone\\". By 1861, wool presses, at least one of which was steam powered, were located on either side of the stores fronting Bremer Street. A steam- powered cotton gin was added, probably in early 1862. Gray also had a store on the corner of Bell and Bremer Streets. Walter Gray died in 1862 and, by 1865, John and George Harris, merchants and agents from Brisbane, had taken over the wharf site. Harris's and Gray had jointly acted as agents for at least one ocean- going ship just prior to his death. J and G Harris built a large brick store on the southern side of Bremer Street on the Bell Street corner opposite the wharf. They probably also upgraded the wharf to a more substantial timber landing with a new wharf-side shed in the early 1860s. The upstream side of the new shed was shaped in a \\"v\\" configuration to withstand water pressure on the regular occasions that the Bremer flooded the site. In 1867 J & G Harris was paying rent for a water frontage of . This was the third largest frontage in the precinct. Harris's appears to have ceased operation at the site by 1878 when they applied to the Ipswich Town Clerk to remove their buildings. The Australasian Steam Navigation Company (ASN) wharf was established next to Gray's wharf between 1856 and 1861. ASN had an interest in the Ipswich shipping trade as early as 1856 when Gray acted as their agent. In 1860 they launched a steamer, Ipswich, specifically for trade between Brisbane and Ipswich. By July 1861, the company had acquired the site next to Gray's and had completed improvements on it. Originally formed in Sydney in 1839/40 as The Hunter's River Steam Navigation Company, ASN had become the principal shipping firm in the Australian coastal trade by the 1850s. The company commenced a regular service to Moreton Bay when it opened to free settlement in 1842 and in 1844 they established their first wharf facility in Brisbane. The company's activities contributed significantly to the expansion of settlement in Queensland. Initially, the ASN wharf was a small timber wharf or an \\"earth bank\\" similar to Gray's wharf. A shed was located immediately adjacent to the wharf and a store fronted Bremer Street. A slide linked the wharf-side shed and the store. ASN rebuilt most of their wharf facilities in 1867 after a flood had destroyed their earlier buildings. A new shed was built next to the wharf, with of this partitioned off for customs use. The walls were high and the centre beam, high. The structure was fastened with iron ties and braces and roofed with galvanised iron. Like Harris's shed, the upstream wall was shaped in a \\"v\\" configuration to deflect floodwaters. A new wharf was also built at this time. In 1867, ASN were paying rent for a river frontage of , the largest in the precinct. ASN had probably ceased operations from the Ipswich wharf by 1874 and in 1879 their wharf lease terminated. After 1875, when the rail link to Brisbane was opened, the period of intense riverboat activity ended. A partial revival of river trade occurred in the 1890s, probably due in part to the lack of a rail link to Brisbane after the loss of the Albert Bridge at Indooroopilly in the 1893 flood. However, the economic and political motives that had stimulated the trade in the 1860s and 1870s no longer existed, and it became difficult to justify expending money on keeping the river route viable. Nevertheless, two commercial river services operated in the early 20th century from the site. In 1903 William Collins & Son used a wharf next to the remains of Harris's wharf. Collins operated a number of vessels between Brisbane and Ipswich including the Mary, Eucalypta, Essex, Myora and Advance. A \\"stiff legged\\" timber crane was used to unload goods at the wharf. Increasingly unable to compete with road transport, Collins ceased the river service cira 1927. In 1932 Percy Manders commenced trading using the cargo vessel MV Eclipse. Manders made three trips weekly carrying of all kinds of merchandise. He initially used the former Collins wharf and crane. Virtually no further development took place at the site from the time of Manders' operation until 2006 when the area was landscaped as part of the River Terraces development. Prior to this development, in January 2006, archaeological surveys were completed at the sites. These surveys mapped the remains of the wharves and recovered artefacts.  Description  The wharf remains are located in the River Terraces development at Ipswich, between the railway bridge and the David Trumpy road bridge.  Site 1  The central position on the riverbank of this site is approximately . Two timber piles are extant on the site projecting out of the water at low tide. These are apart and each average in diameter. They stand from the riverbed to top. They are constructed from a dark red timber, possibly iron bark. An associated artefact field on the riverbed extends up to downstream from the downstream pile and upstream merges into the artefact field associated with Site 2. It extends up to into the river channel.  Site 2  The central position of this site is approximately . Three timber bearers measuring about in diameter project up to horizontally from the riverbank. The outer ends are modified (scarfed) on the underside to enable them to sit onto piles or a wharf head. The timber may be turpentine. A stone wall underneath these bearers is built into the riverbank. This wall is covered at high tide. An associated artefact field extends upstream from the site and downstream merges with artefacts associated with site 1. The field extends up to into the river channel.  Heritage listing  Remnants of Ipswich Town Wharves was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 31 July 2006 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Remnants of Ipswich Town Wharves on the town reach of the Bremer River, are important in demonstrating the evolution of Queensland's history insofar that they are surviving evidence of the important early river commerce between Ipswich and the coast. Ipswich was one of the first river ports to be established in the colony. As the westernmost point of access to Moreton Bay via the Bremer and Brisbane Rivers, the town was a major port for the Darling Downs and West Moreton until the railway opened to Brisbane in 1875. During this period, the Bremer and Brisbane Rivers below Ipswich constituted one of the most important mercantile routes in the colony. The wharf remnants are evidence of this commerce and Ipswich's key role in it. The wharf remnants are also physical evidence of an important aspect of the historical rivalry between Ipswich and Brisbane. The river trade, in which the wharves played a vital role, underpinned Ipswich's rapid growth and prosperity and was the key to its viability as an alternative export port to Brisbane. The river commerce was an important factor in the town's bid to become the colony's capital. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The Remnants are rare as surviving physical evidence of the early commerce between Ipswich and the coast along the Bremer River and Brisbane Rivers. There are no other known remains of this important early trade route. The remnants of the wharves are uncommon insofar that they constitute a largely undisturbed archaeological site in an urban setting. The site functioned as a wharf precinct from the 1840s until at least the 1930s. From that period until 2006, no significant built development took place on the riverbank or in the river. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Queensland's history. As an archaeological site, the remnants of the wharves have the potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the historical river trade along the Bremer and Brisbane Rivers and Ipswich's role in this. They also have the potential to contribute to our knowledge of trade to and from the Darling Downs and West Moreton, regions that made an important contribution to the development of Queensland. Most of the goods being conveyed to or from these areas prior to 1875 were channelled through the Ipswich wharves. The site has the potential to contribute to our knowledge of the Australasian Steam Navigation Company (ASN). An ASN wharf occupied the site from ca 1861 to ca 1874. ASN was the principal shipping firm in the Australian coastal trade by the 1850s. Its activities contributed significantly to the expansion of settlement in Queensland.

After living with and learning the languages of many of the tribes in the area, he was a go between and peacemaker between American miners and local Native Americans, in the Southwestern United States. Early life John T. Moss was born in Utica, New York on March 4, 1839. He moved west with his family to Mitchel County, Iowa. In 1857, he left his family and traveled west for two years. During this time he trapped, and rode for the Pony Express. He became acquainted with and lived with the Paiute of Utah and the Hopi, Yavapai, Mohave and Pima of Arizona. He scouted for a short time for the Army at Fort Mohave, and claimed that in April 1861, he had floated alone down the Colorado River on a raft from Lee's Ferry through the Grand Canyon to Fort Mohave. But there were no witnesses to confirm this claim.Dan L. Thrapp, Encyclopedia of Frontier Biography: G-O, U. of Nebraska Press, August 1, 1991 p.1026 Early mining ventures In 1861, he was one of the more successful discoverers of rich silver lodes in El Dorado Canyon on the west side of the river above Fort Mohave. There he prospected, staked out claims for the Techatticup and Queen City Mines, in what became the Colorado Mining District then rushed to San Francisco to spread the word of the strike and sold his claims to mining speculators including George Hearst for a huge profit. In 1862, he discovered the Moss Mine on the east side of the Colorado River, 9 miles from Fort Mohave in what became the San Francisco Mining District in the Spring of 1863. He dug out an estimated $250,000 in gold in a small pocket. He went to San Francisco claiming his mine was the most immense strike on record, surpassing the Comstock Lode, with ore assaying as much as $24,000 a ton and running for more than three miles with an average width of 100 feet. He then sold the claim for $30,000 to the Philadelphia Ophir Company whose backers included Thomas A. Scott.Mohave Daily Miner, April 29, 1987, p.5George Ernest Webb, Science in the American Southwest: A Topical History, University of Arizona Press, 2002, p.41 Later in 1863, he went into the Hualapai Mountains and organized the Wauba Yuma Mining District, named for his friend the Hualapai chief Wauba Yuma. Trips to Washington In a bid to get the job of Indian Agent for the new Colorado River Indian Reservation Moss took Irataba, a chief of the Mohave and Antonio Azul, of the Pima, to New York by sea from San Francisco via Panama and to Washington D. C. in early 1864. Returning in June he went back the next year but failed to get the appointment. Later mining ventures For a time he prospected in the Sierra Nevada Mountains in California. He then crossed the Mohave Desert on foot, then returned to visit Iowa in 1871. He then returned to prospect in the desert regions of San Bernardino County. He became involved, innocently, on the periphery of the diamond hoax of 1872. In 1873, Moss moved on to help to open the San Juan mining region in the southwest of Colorado. He established Parrott City in La Plata County, Colorado, named from one of his San Francisco backers. In September 1874 he guided the photographer William H. Jackson to the site of Mesa Verde. In 1875, he married Alida Olson in the first marriage in La Plata County. He was elected to the state legislature from his county. Afterward he returned to San Francisco. Death He died in San Francisco on April 11, 1880. as a result of complications from a gunshot wound he reportedly received from an Indian in Southern California.

For example, American nationality law provides (with limited exceptions) that anyone born on US territory is a US citizen (jus soli), including those who leave as infants or young children, even if neither parent is a US citizen (as in the case of Boris Johnson). US law also ascribes American citizenship to some children born abroad to a US citizen parent (jus sanguinis), even if those children never enter the United States. Since the early 2000s, the term \\"Accidental American\\" has been adopted by several activist groups to protest tax treaties and Inter-Governmental Agreements which treat such people as American citizens who are therefore potentially subject to tax and financial reporting (e.g. FATCA and FBAR) requirements--requirements which few other countries impose on their nonresident citizens. Accidental Americans may be unaware of these requirements, or their US citizen status, until they encounter problems accessing bank services in their home countries, for example, or are barred from entering the USA on a non-US passport. Furthermore, the US State Department now charges USD 2350 to renounce citizenship (or otherwise obtain a Certificate of Loss of Nationality), while tax reporting requirements associated with legal expatriation may pose additional financial burdens. Nationality law U.S. nationality law provides for both jus soli and jus sanguinis (see ), as well as derivative citizenship upon the naturalization of a parent (). Birth or parental naturalization in the U.S. Children born in the U.S. are U.S. citizens, regardless of their parents' citizenship or immigration status or whether the family lives in the U.S. after the child is born; the only exception recognized under current law is for children born to foreign diplomats. Many babies who grew up in towns along the Canada‚ÄìUnited States border were born in a hospital on the opposite side of the border and thus acquired the citizenship of the other country this way. Also, when an immigrant to the U.S. becomes a naturalized citizen, under the Child Citizenship Act of 2000, the immigrant's minor children become U.S. citizens along with their parent as long as they are living in the U.S. as lawful permanent residents at the time of the parent's naturalization or later enter the U.S. under LPR status in their minority. In each of these cases, the child becomes a U.S. citizen automatically, without any choice in the matter. Mumbai tax lawyer Poorvi Chothani stated that many Indians living in the U.S. on work visas \\"eagerly obtain U.S. citizenship\\" for their children but \\"do not even examine the long-term implications of this\\", and that she even has a client who is suing his own father for the reason of such an unwanted U.S. citizenship. Birth abroad and role of registration U.S. law also states that a child born outside of the U.S to a U.S. citizen parent who previously spent sufficient time in the U.S. is a U.S. citizen at birth, regardless of whether the child also has the citizenship of the country of birth or another citizenship. U.S. citizens married to fellow U.S. citizens can transmit U.S. citizenship to their children if either parent has ever had a residence in the United States (without any minimum time limitation on how long they held that residence.) However, for U.S. citizens married to non-U.S. citizens, the required period of residence is longer; under the Nationality Act of 1940 and the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, the required period of residence was set to ten years, five of which had to be after the age of 14. The Immigration and Nationality Act Amendments of 1986 reduced this to five years, two of which had to be after the age of 14. This makes it possible in some cases for \\"accidental American\\" status to be passed down over multiple generations, for example if an accidental American spends sufficient time in the U.S. to meet the physical presence requirements to pass down their U.S. citizenship to their own children born outside of the United States. Previously, this had been most likely to occur in the case of the child of an unmarried U.S. citizen mother and non-American father. Under , only one year of continuous physical presence in the United States is required for an unmarried mother to pass down citizenship to children born abroad. However, in 2017 the Supreme Court struck down the distinction between unmarried mothers and unmarried fathers as a violation of the Equal Protection Clause (resolving an earlier split between the Second and Ninth Circuits), holding instead that all American parents married to non-Americans should be required to meet the same longer five-year standard of residence to pass citizenship to their children. Under a strict reading of U.S. nationality law, consular registration is not required in order for a child born outside of the U.S. to a qualifying parent to \\"become\\" a U.S. citizen; the child is a U.S. citizen from the moment of birth. However, for practical reasons, if a child's birth is not reported to a U.S. consulate or United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, the child would not have any proof of U.S. citizenship and the U.S. government might remain unaware of the child's citizenship status. Retired U.S. State Department official Andrew Grossman wrote in 2007 that in cases of \\"doubtful nationality\\" in which a child's derivative U.S. citizenship remained undocumented and unreported to the U.S. government, the child was not regarded as a U.S. citizen either for tax or other purposes, and he expected that it would be quite difficult for tax authorities to make determinations of jus sanguinis citizenship on their own. Karen Christensen, also of the U.S. State Department (Deputy Assistant Secretary for Overseas Citizens Services, Bureau of Consular Affairs), stated that \\"it is the process of being documented as a U.S. citizen that would result in official government recognition of the child‚Äôs U.S. citizenship status\\". This ambiguity has resulted in American emigrant parents, particularly those married to people of other nationalities, choosing not to report the births of their children born in other countries to U.S. consulates, in the hopes that this would allow the children to escape notice by the U.S. government. Mark Matthews of Caplin & Drysdale stated, \\"When clients who have lived abroad for years come in, concerned about whether they have an obligation under FATCA, they sometimes react to the suggestion that their kids might be American the way one might react to a horrible medical diagnosis.\\" Retroactive restoration of citizenship Retroactive restoration of U.S. citizenship previously lost might occur when a statute regarding loss of U.S. citizenship is declared unconstitutional. The issue ultimately arises from the fact that obtaining a Certificate of Loss of Nationality has never been necessary under U.S. nationality law to trigger loss of citizenship, but is merely a document which confirms the loss of citizenship caused by an earlier act. In earlier years, an unknown number of people who lost U.S. citizenship according to contemporary law simply ceased to exercise the benefits of U.S. citizenship (for example, no longer voting, letting their U.S. passport expire) and began identifying themselves to the U.S. government as foreigners (for example, by using foreign passports to enter the United States) without obtaining a CLN. Additionally, the U.S. government has asserted that even a person who has been issued a CLN, but under a provision of law later found unconstitutional, remains a U.S. citizen all along. In 1998, the State Department estimated that there were several thousand individuals of this latter type, who had never contacted the U.S. government seeking to have their CLNs vacated. One early case causing retroactive restoration of citizenship was Schneider v. Rusk (1964). In that case, the Supreme Court considered , which provided for loss of U.S. citizenship by a naturalized citizen taking up residence in a country of which he or she had previously been a citizen. The Court found that the statute unconstitutionally discriminated between native-born and naturalized citizens. This ruling protected plaintiff-appellee Angelika Schneider from unwanted loss of her U.S. citizenship, against which she had protested by taking her case to the Supreme Court. However, in the aftermath the U.S. government took the position that all persons who had lost U.S. citizenship under Section 1482 should be treated as never having lost citizenship, regardless of whether they made a subsequent claim to the benefits of U.S. citizenship, were ignorant of their restored citizenship, or were even unwilling to have it restored. A more complicated situation arose from Vance v. Terrazas (1980). In that case, the Supreme Court considered , providing that U.S. citizens could expatriate themselves by performing certain acts involving citizenship or allegiance to a foreign country, including swearing an oath of allegiance to a foreign country. The State Department at the time argued that those acts themselves constituted evidence of intent to give up citizenship, but the Court disagreed and required that the intent be proven by the party asserting the loss of citizenship through the preponderance of the evidence, encompassing not only the act itself but the individual's other statements and conduct. Again, this ruling protected the individual involved, who asserted his citizenship against State Department efforts to demonstrate that he had relinquished it. However, this effectively imposed a new requirement on other people, without notification to them and without regard to whether they preferred to be U.S. citizens: before they only had to commit the act to relinquish U.S. citizenship, but afterwards if they sought to obtain a CLN, they had the affirmative burden of proving intent contemporary with the act, otherwise the U.S. government would deem them to have been U.S. citizens all along. The issue of retroactive restoration of citizenship interacts with birth abroad as mentioned above, in that children born during a period in which the parent believed him or herself not to be a U.S. citizen might themselves be regarded as citizens at birth due to a retroactive restoration of the parent's citizenship to the year in which the child was born. Awareness of U.S. citizenship Preclearance screening by U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers stationed overseas may reveal that a traveller with a non-U.S. passport has a U.S. birthplace, leading to questions over the traveller's citizenship. Accidental Americans may become aware in various ways that the U.S. considers them to be its citizens. First, accidental Americans born in the United States may encounter difficulties when attempting to enter the U.S. on a non-U.S. passport, as U.S. law () requires all U.S. citizens to use U.S. passports when entering the country. An airline employee or U.S. Customs and Border Protection official who notes the U.S. place of birth in the passport might refuse to allow the person to board a flight, or demand that the person pay a fee to apply for a waiver of the passport requirement. Famously, the current Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Boris Johnson was denied boarding on a flight which transited the U.S. in 2006, after which he first claimed that he wanted to renounce his U.S. citizenship, but instead applied for a U.S. passport some years later. In the past, Canadians were unlikely to encounter such difficulties, because passports were not required to cross the Canada‚ÄìUnited States border, but in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 attacks, the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative tightened documentary requirements for entering the United States by land or by sea, and so Canadians crossing into the United States had to show proof of Canadian citizenship; if they used a Canadian passport as such proof, it would indicate their place of birth. Furthermore, in the aftermath of the 2009 UBS tax evasion controversy, the U.S. government began concerted efforts to identify U.S. citizens who held non-U.S. financial accounts. A major limb of this effort was the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA), passed in 2010, which imposed additional taxes on the U.S. income of non-U.S. banks which did not sign an agreement with the IRS to collect information about their customers' citizenships and to provide the IRS with any information on customers identified as having \\"U.S. indicia\\", including a U.S. place of birth. Following FATCA's passage, many banks began inquiring into the birthplaces and parentage of their customers, raising awareness among accidental Americans that the U.S. government might consider them to be citizens. FATCA also resulted in closures of bank accounts belonging to people identified as U.S. citizens; a 2014 survey of U.S. citizens in other countries by Democrats Abroad found that 12.7% of respondents had been denied financial services by their banks. Often, banks requested CLNs from customers born in the United States who asserted they were not U.S. citizens, leading to difficulties both for customers who had been U.S. citizens all along without knowing it, and for those whose U.S. citizenship had been restored retroactively without their knowledge. Allison Christians of McGill University noted that whether or not the IRS is interested in pursuing non-wealthy accidental Americans, banks had been known to \\"overreact\\" to customers' potential ties to the United States, due to the banks' own fears of IRS penalties for errors. Tax consequences Taxation of non-residents Systems of taxation on personal income Like the United States, many other countries have laws for transmission of citizenship by descent, but those countries impose tax filing obligations only on people who reside or earn income in those countries; the United States and Eritrea are the only countries which impose taxation and reporting requirements on the income which citizens living abroad permanently earn in their countries of residence. Despite their lack of personal or business ties to the United States, accidental Americans have the same U.S. tax filing and payment obligations as do self-identifying \\"Americans abroad\\" who are aware of their U.S. citizenship status, and are subject to the same fines for failure to file. Tax treaties generally do not serve to mitigate the double taxation and filing burdens such people face, as all U.S. tax treaties give the U.S. the power to tax U.S. citizens residing in other countries as if the treaty did not exist; such treaties generally only benefit business entities and dual-resident non-U.S. citizens. The result, as tax attorney Gavin Leckie put it, is that \\"people who have no sense of being American find themselves caught up in a maze of rules really aimed at the U.S. resident citizen seeking to defer or evade U.S. taxes by holding assets offshore\\". People who once had U.S. permanent residence status (\\"green card holders\\") may also face similar tax issues as accidental citizens, combined with similar unawareness of their status. Green card holders generally have the same U.S. tax filing obligations as U.S. citizens, regardless of their actual residence. Many green card holders later emigrated from the U.S. and let their green cards expire, believing that since they were no longer entitled under immigration law to live in the U.S., they also correspondingly had no further tax obligations. However, provides that a green card holder's tax obligations do not end until a formal administrative or judicial determination of abandonment of U.S. residence; this generally requires the green card holder not just to move out of the United States, but to file Form I-407 with United States Citizenship and Immigration Services. About eighteen thousand people per year file this form, but it is likely that many more green card holders moving out of the U.S. are unaware that this procedure is required. Filing and compliance difficulties Accidental Americans have faced difficulty obtaining Social Security numbers, which U.S. citizens must possess in order to file taxes with the Internal Revenue Service. The Internal Revenue Code provides for a foreign earned income exclusion allowing non-resident U.S. tax filers to exclude wage income up to a certain threshold ($99,400 for the 2013 tax filing season) from U.S. taxation, as well as credits for taxes paid to other countries. The result is that accidental Americans often do not owe U.S. income tax, but must spend thousands of dollars in accounting fees to prove that fact, and face potential fines of tens of thousands of dollars for paperwork errors. The reason is that the foreign earned income exclusion does not affect filing obligations nor the treatment of non-U.S bank accounts and investment plans. Tax lawyers state that compliance with the foreign trust and passive foreign investment company rules can be particularly onerous, because their definitions are so broad as to include mutual funds, retirement accounts, and similar such structures owned by accidental Americans in their country of residence; people with savings in these kinds of plans will face higher taxes and compliance burdens than U.S. residents who keep money in similar U.S. investment plans. Those who have spent their lives planning for their retirement without considering the U.S. tax consequences of the non-U.S. financial instruments they hold may find that U.S. taxation, in particular PFIC taxation, wipes out most of their returns on investments; as Allison Christians states, \\"the PFIC regime is designed to be so harsh that no one would ever knowingly own one unless they were treating it like a partnership, and marking it to market annually with the assistance of sophisticated tax counsel\\". Even Canada's Registered Disability Savings Plan (RDSP) falls under U.S. foreign trust reporting requirements. RDSPs and other registered Canadian accounts for education and retirement savings are exempt from FATCA reporting by banks under the FATCA agreement between Canada and the United States, but this agreement does not relieve the U.S. individual income taxes owed on such plans, nor the individual owner's obligation to file the non-FATCA-related trust or PFIC forms. Under the 2011 Offshore Voluntary Disclosure Initiative, people residing outside of the U.S. who stated that they did not file U.S. tax and asset-reporting forms because they were unaware of their U.S. citizenship faced fines of 5% of their assets. In many cases, it has also proven difficult for accidental Americans born abroad to obtain Social Security numbers (SSNs), which are required for them to file U.S. taxes. In response to this issue, the State Bar of California's Taxation Section issued a proposal in 2015 for the IRS to allow Americans citizens without SSNs residing in other countries to obtain Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers (ITINs) instead. Current regulations () require all U.S. citizens to use SSNs as their Taxpayer Identification Number, while ITINs are only available to non-citizens; however, the underlying statute () does not require this, and so the California Bar suggested that their proposal could be accomplished by issuing new Treasury regulations without needing to wait for Congress to pass any new legislation. Giving up U.S. citizenship Overview A U.S. citizen who voluntarily performed an act specified in may declare to a U.S. consulate that he or she intended to relinquish U.S. citizenship through that act and obtain a Certificate of Loss of Nationality (pictured) documenting that fact. Accidental Americans who become aware of their U.S. citizenship status have the option of looking into ways of renouncing or relinquishing it. Although it is possible for children to acquire U.S. citizenship \\"accidentally\\" without any voluntary action on their part, under current law they cannot lose that citizenship status accidentally or automatically as adults; instead, they must take voluntary action to give it up. United States nationality law () formerly provided for automatic loss of U.S. citizenship by dual citizens resident abroad, but this was repealed by the Immigration and Nationality Act Amendments of 1978 (; ). The Quarterly Publication of Individuals Who Have Chosen to Expatriate, which lists names of certain people with respect to whom the IRS received information on loss of citizenship during the quarter in question, in 2011 began showing a sharp rise in the number of names included. Lawyers disagree whether the Quarterly Publication is a complete list of all people giving up U.S. citizenship, or whether it only includes covered expatriates (people with certain levels of assets, tax liabilities, or tax filing or payment deficiencies). Regardless, various U.S. lawyers have commented, based on their experiences with clients, that the majority of the early 2010s increase in renunciations of U.S. citizenship is probably attributable to accidental Americans, rather than the popular stereotype of wealthy people who move to a tax haven after becoming rich in the United States. As a practical matter, renunciation of U.S. citizenship became markedly more difficult in 2014, meaning that even accidental Americans who were aware of their U.S. citizenship status and wanted to rid themselves of it faced obstacles: in addition to the cost of making the required tax filings with the IRS, the State Department raised the fee for renunciation to US$2,350, roughly twenty times the fee charged by other high-income countries, and wait times for renunciation appointments at some U.S consulates grew to ten months or longer. Expatriation tax The Internal Revenue Code imposes an expatriation tax on people giving up U.S. citizenship. Payment of the tax is not a prerequisite to giving up citizenship; rather, the tax and its associated reporting forms are paid and filed during the following year, on the normal tax return due date. People who had both U.S. and another citizenship at birth, reside in their country of other citizenship, and have not been U.S. residents in more than 10 of the past 15 tax years, may be exempt from this tax (); this provides a potential exception for some accidental Americans. However, this exception only applies to those who can state, under penalty of perjury, that they have fulfilled all of their U.S. tax filing and payment requirements for the preceding five years, and people who were not aware of their status as U.S. citizens are unlikely to have made the required filings and payments. Furthermore, accidental Americans who do not reside in their country of other citizenship but rather a third country, for example due to work or family ties there, cannot qualify for this expatriation tax exemption either. In the late 1990s, the newly tightened U.S. expatriation tax system allowed individuals who would otherwise be subject to the tax to apply for a private letter ruling (PLR) that their termination of U.S. citizenship was not tax-motivated. (The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 terminated the PLR exception to the expatriation tax.) The very first such PLR request came from a British citizen who stated that he was unaware of his U.S. citizenship; Willard Yates, a retired tax attorney then with the IRS' Office of Associate Chief Council (International) who handled that PLR request, initially expressed disbelief at the possibility that anyone could be unaware of their U.S. citizenship, but states that later, \\"after working a bunch of 877 PLRs, I realized we didn‚Äôt know anything about anything when it came to U.S. citizens working overseas, accidental or otherwise.\\" Proposed remedies President Barack Obama's proposed United States federal budget for 2016 included provisions to exempt certain accidental Americans from both the payment of U.S. tax on non-U.S. source income, and the expatriation tax, if they gave up U.S. citizenship within two years from the time they became aware of it. The proposal was limited to those who had been dual citizens at birth, had maintained citizenship of a foreign country since birth, had not lived in the United States since age 18¬Ω, and had only held a United States passport in order to depart from the United States in compliance with . The Congressional Budget Office estimated that this proposal would cost the United States roughly $403 million in tax revenue over the following ten years, with the majority ($208 million) of the revenue loss occurring in the first three years. Temple University law professor Peter Spiro described this as possible evidence that the U.S. government was beginning to conclude \\"that the imposition of U.S. taxes on accidental Americans is unsustainable.\\" Roy A. Berg of tax law firm Moodys Gartner believed that the proposal had little chance of being passed by Congress, but that the executive branch might be able to implement similar relief solely through regulatory amendments. More broadly, advocacy groups including American Citizens Abroad and Republicans Overseas have also proposed that the U.S. switch to the system of residence- based taxation followed by nearly all other countries in the world. In August 2014, the Republican National Committee, at the urging of Republicans Overseas, unanimously adopted a resolution calling for an end to citizenship- based taxation.

The memorial was erected to commemorate the heroism of police constable James Sangster who drowned attempting to save two people. It was designed and built in 1898 by C Wilson & Co. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 18 September 2008.  History  James Sangster Memorial, circa 1940 The James Sangster Memorial, located at Brown's Park, North Ipswich, was dedicated on Saturday 7 May 1898 with funds raised by the people of Ipswich. It was erected to commemorate the heroism of police constable James Sangster who drowned, aged 25 years, in February 1893, whilst attempting to rescue two people trapped by floodwaters. The 1893 floods were the outcome of the \\"Mooloolah rainfall event\\", the highest recorded rainfall in south-east Queensland to that date, with of rain falling in 72 hours. From 30 January 1893 the rain effects of three tropical cyclones affected south-east Queensland and northern New South Wales in quick succession. Over of rain in the Brisbane River catchment caused heavy flooding and extensive damage. Approximately were flooded as the river rose or more above normal level in some places. Over a two-week period from 1‚Äì14 February 1893, 35 people were killed, 500 were injured and over 5,000 were made homeless. Over 600 houses were destroyed; 150 of these were washed away, many out to sea. Several of the 35 deaths occurred as houses were swept away and others as people tried to use boats in the torrent. In Ipswich the Bremer River overflowed its banks on Friday 3 February with the water reported at being approximately deep in Brisbane Street that night. On Saturday, 4 February, the Brisbane River rose close to the Jackson family home at Blackwall, near Kholo, about from Ipswich. Mr Jackson, an engine driver on the Ipswich line, was at work at the time. Mary Jackson remained in the house with John Rowe, a farm worker, whilst Mrs Jackson and her other children, including 17-year-old Kate, rowed to shore. The plan was that, after reaching the riverbank, Kate, who was described as an excellent rower and swimmer, was to return to the house for the other two. As the boat neared the riverbank, however, it overturned. Mrs Jackson and one of her daughters sought refuge in a tree and were rescued by nearby railway workers. In spite of her swimming ability, Kate was not strong enough to hold the other three children (two sisters and a brother) and all four drowned. Their bodies were recovered the following Tuesday. With waters rising Mary Jackson and John Rowe, who had remained in the house, climbed onto the roof. As the waters rose, the house was lifted and carried downstream crashing into a large tree. Both managed to cling to the tree and climb into branches above the water. Constable James Sangster had arrived at the riverbank on horseback, meeting a rescue party with a boat. He and another man attempted to reach the two but the boat was swamped. Sangster, who could not swim, reached a sapling as the other man swam safely to shore. Rescue attempts continued however the sapling snapped and Constable Sangster disappeared with onlookers powerless to help. His body was never recovered. Mary Jackson and John Rowe remained in the tree for 22 hours until the waters receded and they were rescued safely. Constable James Sangster Sangster had applied for admission into the Queensland Police Force on 21 May 1890 and was sworn in on 4 August 1890, aged 22 years. He had been living in the colony for three years residing for some of that time in Charters Towers. Originally from Aberdeenshire in Scotland, he had no relatives in Queensland. He arrived in Ipswich in November 1890 and was based at the North Ipswich Police Station. After the tragedy, members of the Jackson family decided to raise funds by public subscription to erect a memorial in Sangster's honour. A memorial fund committee was established to erect a monument in Brown's Park, North Ipswich. The government contributed to the fund. The memorial, occupying a prominent position in Brown's Park, was completed by Messrs C Wilson & Co. and was unveiled on Saturday 7 May 1898 by Alfred John Stephenson, the Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly for Ipswich at a well-attended ceremony and to the sounds of the Brisbane Police Band. A marble lion's head was located immediately above the fountain's bowl. The James Sangster Memorial is the only known monument in Queensland erected by public subscription to commemorate a police officer serving at the time of his death. The Queensland Police Museum records other police officers who have had headstones and memorials erected by police colleagues, including Senior Constable Alfred Wavell who had a memorial headstone erected \\"by comrades in conjunction with the government of Queensland\\" at Corinda, south-west of Burketown in October 1889, after being fatally shot whilst on duty. Another officer, Senior Constable William Conroy, had his headstone erected by the \\"Queensland government and officers and men of the Queensland Police Force\\" in July 1895. Senior Constable Conroy had been stabbed during a domestic dispute on Thursday Island. The Sangster memorial was erected at a period when public memorials honouring prominent local citizens were popular expressions of public sentiment. Other Queensland public memorial drinking fountains erected to commemorate an individual include: * the Eagle street Fountain, Brisbane (Mooney Memorial Fountain), erected between 1878 and 1880, dedicated to firefighter James Mooney who lost his life whilst fighting a fire in Queen Street in 1877 * the Mary Watson's Monument, Cooktown, erected in 1886 by the citizens of Cooktown to honour Mrs Mary Watson, who perished, along with her infant son and her Chinese employee Ah Sam, from thirst and exposure on one of the islands of the Howick group, northeast of Cooktown, in October 1881 * the Dr EA Koch Memorial, Cairns, erected in 1903 by the citizens of Cairns, to honour the doctor's work in tropical medicine in Cairns and district in the late nineteenth century * the FDA Carstens Memorial, Port Douglas, erected -1908 by his widow to honour her husband's work with the Douglas Divisional Board In 1989 conservation works were undertaken to the James Sangster Memorial by Thomas Andrew Farrell, stonemason and sculptor. At this time some of the stonework and the plaque were replaced. The stone came from Helidon with the original stone coming from Denmark Hill. The original lead-lettered, marble memorial plaque has been removed to the Queensland Police Museum in Brisbane. The James Sangster Memorial is now the focus for the annual Police Remembrance Day service in Ipswich. Since 1989, National Police Remembrance Day has been observed in Brisbane and many regional centres throughout Queensland on 29 September, which coincides with the Feast of the Archangel St Michael who was said to have always fought evil. The memorial was restored again in 2006 with the Queensland Government contributing $9,600 through the Community Memorial Restoration Program and $1,000 donated by the Queensland Police Service. At this time, the monument was moved back from the road further into the park to accommodate widening of the street. Following the restoration the monument was re-dedicated on 4 August 2006, the same day on which Constable Sangster had been sworn into the Queensland Police Force in 1890.  Description  The James Sangster Memorial is constructed of sandstone and stands high. It sits on the Downs Street boundary of Brown's Park, flanked by boundary tree plantings to each side and the rest of the park behind it. It acts as a closure to views east along Canning Lane. The memorial is capped by a broken obelisk, symbolising a life cut short with its floral wreath motifs symbolising remembrance of the dead. The stepped base on which the memorial fountain stands is relatively plain. Above this base the pedestal carries the bowl at the front, with a column recessed into each corner. Above this is a heavy projecting label mould, which at the front, receives the shaped top of the dedication plaque and on the other three sides bears a laurel wreath. Above the plaque is a wreath, carved chiefly of roses. Dropping from the centre of the broken obelisk is another wreath and under this there is a floral motif located on each face. The dedication on the replacement plaque reads: > Erected by public subscription in memory of Constable James Sangster who > lost his life in a gallant attempt at rescue in the flood waters of the > Brisbane River 5 February 1893  Heritage listing  James Sangster Memorial was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 18 September 2008 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Dedicated on 7 May 1898, the James Sangster Memorial Fountain is significant for its symbolic association with the impact of the devastating floods of 1893 that affected south-east Queensland. Constable Sangster lost his life attempting to save lives in the floods in the North Ipswich area, his heroism being acknowledged by the community and the colonial government with the construction of the memorial fountain. The James Sangster Memorial is the only known monument in Queensland erected by public subscription to commemorate a police officer serving at the time of his death. The memorial fountain is distinctive as it provides a tangible and poignant reminder of the impact of the 1893 floods and illustrates how one community worked through a grieving process after it was affected by one of the highest floods recorded in the colony to that date.

Salhi was arrested and charged with murder and attempted murder linked to terrorism. Three other people were questioned by the police but released without charge. Salhi committed suicide in jail in December. The attack occurred on the same day as several other Islamist terrorist attacks, which have subsequently been named the 2015 Ramadan attacks, though any relationship between the various incidents is disputed. French authorities believe that Salhi has links with the Islamist terrorist group the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). The attack occurred during heightened public fears over Islamist attacks in France, a few months after the √éle-de-France attacks in January 2015, including the Charlie Hebdo shooting. Attack At around 09:30 CEST (07:30 UTC) on 26 June 2015, Yassin Salhi, a delivery driver, gained entrance to the grounds of an Air Products factory in Saint- Quentin-Fallavier near the city of Lyon. He was driving a van with his dead 54-year-old boss, Herv√© Cornara, inside it. He had tricked Cornara into getting into the van earlier that day, after which Salhi knocked him unconscious and strangled him. He then decapitated Cornara just before reaching the factory. Salhi had made regular visits to the factory, so he was known to employees at the site. He placed Cornara's severed head on a fence railing and planted two Jihadist flag banners alongside it. The head had a cloth thrown over it with the Shahada written on it: \\"There is no god but Allah and Muhammad is his prophet.\\" The headless body and a knife were found on the ground nearby. Salhi attempted to blow up the factory by ramming several gas cylinders, causing an explosion. Two other people were injured in the process. Video surveillance footage showed that the perpetrator also tried to open canisters containing flammable chemicals before being subdued minutes later. He shouted \\"Allahu Akhbar\\" as he met and was overpowered by firefighters responding to the scene. The perpetrator had also photographed himself with the slain victim and sent the image to at least one other person via WhatsApp, a French man who later joined ISIL. Perpetrator Yassin Salhi (25 March 1980 ‚Äì 22 December 2015) was reported as the primary attacker, although he may not have acted alone. French police opened a file on Salhi in 2006, over suspected links with a radical Salafist group, but it was not renewed in 2008. In 2012, he was involved in an anti-Semitic attack on a Jewish teenager; the attack took place on a train travelling from Toulouse to Lyon. At the time of the 2015 attack, he was believed to be living in Saint- Priest, with his wife and three children. Six years prior to the attack, Salhi spent a year in Syria with his wife and children, claiming he was there to learn Arabic. At the time of the attack, Salhi was also in regular contact with the French jihadist Sebastian Yunis, known to have left for Syria to join ISIS. Salhi claims his reason for the attack was solely based on personal motives, saying a fight with his employer who fired him as well as a dispute with his wife pushed him to do it. French authorities have linked him to the terrorist group ISIS. Salhi's mother was Moroccan and his father, who died when Salhi was 16, was Algerian. Salhi grew up in Pontarlier, where he was tutored in Arabic by Amar Remimi, treasurer of the Philippe Grenier mosque association. In the mid-2000s, Salhi met and was radicalized by Fr√©d√©ric Jean Salvi, who had served time at the nearby prison in Besan√ßon until 2001. Salvi himself had converted to Islam while in prison, where he then became known as \\"Grand Ali\\". Salvi attended the same mosque in Pontarlier as Salhi, where he at one point was expelled for challenging the imam during a sermon. A coworker at the transport company, Abdel Karim, stated that Salhi had once asked him his opinion of Daesh. After hearing Karim's opinion, Salhi would no longer speak with him other than to say hello and goodbye. According to his lawyer, Salhi had been earlier reprimanded by Cornara for dropping equipment from a pallet, and had attacked his former boss for personal reasons. On 30 June, Salhi was charged with murder and attempted murder linked to terrorism, as well as destruction by means of an explosive substance. On 22 December 2015, Salhi committed suicide in Fleury-M√©rogis Prison by hanging himself with his bed sheets on the bars of his cell. Related arrests Another man was arrested hours after the attack at his home in Saint-Quentin-Fallavier. He was believed to be driving around the factory in a Ford Fusion car before the attack in a suspected reconnaissance attempt. On 26 June, he was released without charge. Salhi's wife and sister were also arrested later that day. They were released without charge two days later. Earlier, his wife gave a radio interview, in which she denied the alleged terror links to the family. Victim The decapitated victim, Herv√© Cornara, was the 54-year-old manager of a transport company based in Chassieu, about 20 miles from the attack. He was married and had a son. He had employed Salhi as a delivery truck driver starting in March.  Air Products  The company Air Products is a United States chemical company based in Allentown, Pennsylvania. Its president and CEO since July 2014, Seifi Ghasemi, is an Iranian-born Shia Muslim. In April 2015 the company won a contract to build, own and operate the world's largest industrial gas complex in Jazan, Saudi Arabia. Air Products officials said security had been increased at its operations around the world as a precautionary measure. The company has facilities in more than 50 countries employing more than 21,000 people. Domestic reaction The President of France, Fran√ßois Hollande, left an EU summit in Brussels to return to France. Hollande said, \\"The attack bears the hallmarks of a terrorist attack.\\" The French Minister of the Interior, Bernard Cazeneuve, was also reported to be traveling to the scene. Other Islamist attacks The attack in Saint- Quentin-Fallavier was one of five Islamist attacks that took place on the same day around the world, including in Tunisia, Kuwait, Somalia, and Syria. These attacks came three days after an audio message by ISIS senior leader Abu Mohammad al-Adnani was released that encouraged militant sympathizers to attack one year after ISIS declared themselves a state, during the month of Ramadan.

Watt commissioned Wyatt to design Heathfield Hall. Watt died in the house in 1819, and was buried at nearby St Mary's Church. His garret workshop was then sealed, and few people were ever allowed to visit it.

Life  Prince David was a son of Prince Bagrat of Imereti by his wife Mariam, n√©e Eristavi of Guria. He was, thus, a grandson of King Alexander V of Imereti, a nephew of King Solomon I, and a cousin of King Solomon II. By the time of the Russian conquest of Imereti in 1810, he lived in his family estate in Argueti. The Russian commander-in-chief in the Caucasus, General Tormasov, ordered to remove from Imereti all members of the royal family, who might have had \\"pernicious influence on the people\\". General Simonovich, a Russian commander in Imereti, interceded and asked Tormasov to allow Prince David to remain in homeland on account of his being \\"mentally retarded and not having any influence on the people\\". Tormasov refused with contempt and ordered that David be deported to Tiflis, noting that \\"the Imeretian people are even more retarded and, out of their insanity, can follow anyone.\\" In June 1819, the people of Imereti rose in rebellion against the Russian encroachment on the local church. The uprising then spread to Guria and Mingrelia. Prince David became on the leaders of the movement in which the clerics, nobles, and peasants were involved. By July 1820, the Russian army under General Velyaminov was able to contain the revolt in Imereti; David and some other rebels withdrew into the mountains of Racha, where suffered a major defeat at the castle of Kvara. David was killed in the fighting; \\"the tsarevich David, son of Bagrat, one of the evilest brigands, is killed\\", the Russian commander- in-chief in the Caucasus, General Yermolov, reported to the Chief of General Staff Prince Volkonsky on 8 October 1820.  Family and descendants  Prince David was married to Princess Darejan, daughter of Vakhtang, of the Eristavi of Racha family. He fathered four sons and two daughters. * Prince Ivan Bagration (1810‚Äì1869), who was married to Princess Elisabed Tsereteli, with issue; * Princess Mariam Bagration (born 1812), married to Prince Ivan Eristavi of Racha; * Prince Teimuraz Bagration (1816 ‚Äì c. 1855), lieutenant- colonel of the Imperial Russian army; * Prince Nikoloz Bagration (1818‚Äì1820); * Princess Ekaterine Bagration (1819‚Äì1890), married to Prince Nikoloz Eristavi of Guria (1817‚Äì1914); * Prince Beri Bagration (fl. 1820).

The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant claimed responsibility for the attack. Kuwait's Emir arrived at the location of the incident after a short period of time.H.H The Emir arrives the incident's location ‚Äì Arabic Kuwaiti al-Watan newspaper ‚Äì 26 June 2015 Twenty-seven people were killed and 227 people were wounded. Twenty-nine suspects were taken to court and after approximately ten sessions, most of them public, 15 were found guilty, with 7 to receive capital punishment (5 in absentia). Those include Adel Eidan, who drove the bomber to the mosque and admitted his intention to bomb the mosque and claimed that he wanted the mosque itself to be bombed, but \\"not the people\\", and Mohammed and Majid az-Zahrani (in absentia), who delivered the explosives to the terrorists in Kuwait and were arrested by Saudi authorities. Three other Islamist attacks took place on the same day in France, Tunisia, and Somalia. The attacks followed an audio message released three days earlier by ISIS senior leader, Abu Mohammad al-Adnani, encouraging militants everywhere to attack the stated enemies of ISIS during the month of Ramadan. No definitive link between the attacks has yet been established. One attack, at a French factory, resulted in the beheading of one person; another, at a Tunisian beach resort, killed 38, most of them British tourists; and the other, an attack on an African Union base undertaken by Al-Shabaab, killed at least 70.  Background  The only prior bombing attacks in Kuwait took place in 1983 and 1985, which caused at least five fatalities - the perpetrators themselves. Sectarian tensions have been generally low in Kuwait. The Imam Ja'far as-Sadiq Mosque is one of the oldest mosques in Kuwait, located in the Sawabir district in Sharq area, which is a part of the Capital Governorate. The mosque is attended mainly by Shia Muslim worshippers. This attack was a part of the strategic terrorism of Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), which considers Shia Islam to be heresy. In late May 2015, after the Qatif and Dammam mosque bombings, ISIL released a voice message calling on Muslims to clear the Arabian Peninsula of its Shia population.  Bomb explosion  A suicide bomber attacked the mosque during Friday prayers in Muslim holy month of Ramadan, factors that made the mosque more crowded than usual. At least eight people were immediately killed in the blast, which heavily damaged parts of the building. A witness said that the bomber entered the last row between the worshipers and detonated his device. Another witness, Parliament member Khalil al-Salih, who was in the mosque during the attack, said the same. He added \\"The explosion was really hard. The ceiling and wall got destroyed\\". He added that more than 2,000 people were praying there at that time.  Victims  Twenty-seven people were killed, consisting of 18 Kuwaitis, three Iranians, two Indians, one Saudi, one Pakistani and one Bedoon. Another 227 people were wounded in the attack, of whom 40 were still hospitalized on 28 June. Eight of the deceased victims were sent to Peace Valley cemetery, in the Shia holy city of Najaf, Iraq, by an official state plane.  Responsibility and investigation  The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant identified the bomber as Abu Suleiman al- Muwahhid, and said in a statement posted on social media that he had targeted a \\"temple of the rejectionists\\" ‚Äì a derogative term used towards Shias. By the following day, Kuwaiti authorities had arrested several people in connection with the attacks, including the driver of the car that took the bomber to the mosque, and the owner of the house he stayed in, which initial investigations showed that he is a supporter of \\"extremist and deviant ideology\\". The Ministry of Interior released a statement on its website two days after, identifying the perpetrator as Fahd Suleiman al-Qabba (born 1992), a Saudi citizen. The statement added that the terrorist arrived in the country on a commercial flight on the day of the attack. In his Instagram account, the arrested owner of the car, posted pictures of him giving lessons to kids in a mosque in the Sulaibiya area. His account was suspended in accordance with Instagram terms. According to local newspapers, the perpetrators were told 20 days before to commit an operation that will \\"Shake Kuwait up\\", and let them choose the time and location. After picking the location, they contacted ISIL leaders about their plans via WhatsApp and e-mail, and checked the mosque for a two-week period. The source says that the explosives arrived at terrorist's house by partners from Saudi Arabia. Accordingly, the driver stopped at the parking lot of the mosque, along with suicide bomber at 11:00 am. Both of them waited until the mosque got crowded with worshipers. The suspected suicide bomber then went out holding a device, and when he opened his hand the bomb exploded. CCTV clip indicates that the suicide bomber walked into the mosque with his left hand crossed at his stomach. After the crime, the perpetrators were planning to escape Kuwait, but the rapid response of the Ministry of the Interior left them with no time to do so. The day of the attacks has been dubbed \\"Bloody Friday\\" by international media. Two weeks later, Saudi authorities said that they had arrested three brothers suspected to be involved in the attack. On 14 July, the public prosecutor charged twenty-nine people involved in the attack - including the two Saudi brothers  and one still at large. The public prosecutor demanded the death penalty for eleven suspects.  Trial  = Criminal Court = Most sessions were public. Eleven suspects were released after the 6 August session, and the trial was deferred to the 10 August to assign new lawyers to those suspects without legal representatives. After the trial, the lawyer of the 9th and 11th suspects stepped down from defending the ninth suspect, as his testimony contradicted that of the eleventh. The lawyer of the 26th suspect also stepped down for \\"private reasons\\". The first suspect's lawyer also stepped down claiming the same reason. The first suspect's, Adel Eidan, the man who drove the bomber to the mosque and brought the explosives from the Saudi brothers near the Kuwaiti-Saudi border and gave shelter to the bomber after he arrived from Saudi Arabia, made the claim that he wanted to bomb the mosque without killing anyone. On the 15 August session, a lawyer was fined 100 KWD (~$330) for not showing up without an excuse, and another attorney was assigned for his clients. On the same session, one of the suspect's claim that he was tortured was refuted by the Forensic Medicine doctors. All session were public except the fourth session, and the suspects were able to see and contact their lawyers. Some females suspects were charged with hiding and destroying important evidence. For example, the twentieth suspect destroyed Fahd al- Qabba's (the bomber's) mobile phone. On 14 September 2015, the court ruled that 15 out of the 29 suspects had been found guilty, with seven receiving death sentences (five in absentia).  Appeals and Cassation Court  The Appeals court reduced the sentence of ISIS leader in Kuwait Fahad Muharib to 15 years in prison, and upheld Eidan's sentence. With this, Eidan is the only defendant in Kuwait to receive the death penalty. The cases of the five other defendants sentenced in absentia were not brought before the higher courts as their charges can only be challenged when they appear. The Cassation Court upheld all of the Appeals Court's sentences.  Aftermath  The Kuwaiti Emir Sheikh Sabah al-Sabah was on the scene minutes after the attack, as was the speaker of the Kuwaiti parliament, who called for an urgent meeting.ŸàŸÇŸàÿπ ÿßŸÜŸÅÿ¨ÿßÿ± ŸÅŸä ŸÖÿ≥ÿ¨ÿØ ÿßŸÑÿ•ŸÖÿßŸÖ ÿßŸÑÿµÿßÿØŸÇ ÿ®ŸÖÿØŸäŸÜÿ© ÿßŸÑŸÉŸàŸäÿ™ ‚Äì ÿ¨ÿ±ŸäÿØÿ© ÿßŸÑÿ±ÿßŸä ‚Äì 26 ŸäŸàŸÜŸäŸà 2015 The cabinet convened an emergency session later in the afternoon.

Funeral  The condolence acceptance was held in Grand Mosque, the country's largest Sunni mosque on Saturday, 27 June. The Emir, Crown Prince, Prime Minister, former Prime Minister, other ministers, MPs, and high-ranked officials all attended. According to the Arab Times, thousands paid their respects. At least 35,000 Kuwaitis, expatriates and mourners from the GCC countries attended the burial at Ja'fari Cemetery in Sulaibikhat. Paramedics were on site and helped those who fainted due to the hot temperature which reached 45 ¬∞C. Parliament Speaker Marzouq Al-Ghanim said at the funeral: \\"The unity of the people of our country is incredible [...] If you look around you will see Sunnis and Shias, Kuwaitis and non-Kuwaitis, all present to give their condolences to the families of the victims.\\"  First anniversary and Mosque's restoration and Emir's visit  The Mosque was renovated and reopened about one year later in June 2016. The Emir of Kuwait, along with Sheikh Nasir al-Sabah, the former Prime Minister of Kuwait, and other members of the royal family visited the mosque and led a voluntary prayer there. Sheikh Nawwaf al-Sabah, the Crown Prince of Kuwait, was quoted praising national unity, adding \\"Kuwait's leaders, government and people are a single family that are united through both good and trying times.\\" The Minister of Justice and Minister of Islamic Affairs Yaqoub al-Sane' was also present. Relatives of the victims applauded the visit, saying it was a reflection of the national unity the terrorists were trying to undermine.

The EXCOR system includes paracorporeal, pneumatically-driven polyurethane blood pumps. Each pump consists of a blood chamber and an air chamber which are separated by a multilayer flexible membrane. The movement of air in and out of the air chamber is controlled by a driving unit. It moves the membranes, which draw blood into the blood chamber and push it back into the body. Like the heart, EXCOR blood pumps have valves which ensure that the blood only flows in one direction. The blood pumps are connected to the heart and blood vessels via silicone cannula. The EXCOR product range covers blood pumps and cannula of various sizes and types. While EXCOR Adult is specifically designed for adults, EXCOR Pediatric includes devices for young patients (from newborns to adolescents).  Trivia  In 2018 Chloe Caldwell became the first pediatric patient to be flown for a medical treatment from the United States to Germany. Caldwell had been implanted a VAD manufactured by Berlin Heart after severe heart problems. A team of doctors at the Berlin's Deutsches Herzzentrum Berlin (DHZB) removed the VAD successfully and she is expected to make a full recovery, without the need of a heart transplant.

Her mother Beryl Gordon (n√© Beryl Valentine‚ÄìHagart) was English and her father Harold John Gordon RIBA (n√©: Hans Julius Goldberg) an Austrian refugee who left Vienna in 1938. Gordon studied Theater and Performance at Dartington College of Arts.Dartingtong College of Arts alumni (now part of Falmouth University) During this time she performed and worked with the People Show, Edward Bond‚Äôs King Lear with Bob Hoskins and Jenny Harris's Combination at the Albany. Gordon gained her British Equity Card working as a deputy stage manager on plays at the Royal Court Theatre Upstairs in Sloane Square, London. She was the stage manager for the first production of the writer in residence Sam Shepard‚Äôs play Action (play) as well as Bird Child by David Lan. Gordon performed in avant-garde social/political theatre in the 1970s ‚Äì 1980s, acting and touring throughout Europe. Most notably in the late 1970s and early 1980s Gordon collaborated, performed and acted for several years with The Pip Simmons Theatre Group.

PAC- Card : Patient‚Äôs Action Communication Card  In 2011, prompted by her own hospital experiences, Gordon developed the PAC-Card (Patient's Action Communication Card). The PAC-Card contains a checklist of essential support questions, for patients to use in any interaction with a health professional. The PAC-Card was tested in a medical trial at OLVG (a large Amsterdam Hospital) by Jeanet Rooseman, Vanessa Scholtes and Dr. R. W. Poolman assessing the effectiveness of the PAC-Card, the following was concluded: ‚ÄòThe primary analysis with regard to patient satisfaction in patient-caregiver communication showed that the PAC-Card had a positive impact on two aspects of patient satisfaction in the intervention group. Patient satisfaction regarding quality of care and the way of communication improved significantly in the intervention group. To support patients in a more structured way of communicating the PAC-Card is recommended to be used by patients. It helps patients communicate more effectively and patients are more satisfied with the quality of care and communication.‚Äô Netwerk Palliatieve Zorg Zeeland, Zo praat je met je artsJeroen Bosch ZiekenhuisDialoogzorg, twee minuten aandacht voor het verhaal van de pati√´nt  The Patient's Guide  In order to facilitate the use of the PAC-Card in 2014 Gordon published The Patient‚Äôs Guide - Think.

ERP system is a computer software that serves to unify the information intended to manage the organization including Production, Supply Chain Management, Financial Management, Human Resource Management, Customer Relationship Management, Enterprise Performance Management. Common ERP systems are SAP, Oracle E-Business Suite, Microsoft Dynamics.  Review  ERP system integrates business processes enabling procurement, payment, transport, human resources management, product management, and financial planning. As ERP system stores confidential information, the Information Systems Audit and Control Association (ISACA) recommends to regularly conduct a comprehensive assessment of ERP system security, checking ERP servers for software vulnerabilities, configuration errors, segregation of duties conflicts, compliance with relevant standards and recommendations, and recommendations of vendors.Security issues in ERP http://www.isaca.org/Knowledge-Center/Research/ResearchDeliverables/Pages/sap- erp.aspx  Causes for vulnerabilities in ERP systems   Complexity  ERP systems process transactions and implement procedures to ensure that users have different access privileges. There are hundreds of authorization objects in SAP permitting users to perform actions in the system. In case of 200 users of the company, there are approximately 800,000 (100*2*20*200) ways to customize security settings of ERP systems.ERP Security and Segregation of Duties Audit: A Framework for Building an Automated Solution https://csbweb01.uncw.edu/people/ivancevichd/classes/MSA%20516/Extra%20Readings%20on%20Topics/Database/ERP%20Security.pdf With the growth of complexity, the possibility of errors and segregation of duties conflicts increases.  Specificity  Vendors fix vulnerabilities on the regular basis since hackers monitor business applications to find and exploit security issues. SAP releases patches monthly on Patch Tuesday, Oracle issues security fixes every quarter in Oracle Critical Patch Update. Business applications are becoming more exposed to the Internet or migrate to the cloud.  Lack of competent specialists  ERP Cybersecurity surveyERP Cybersecurity survey 2017 https://erpscan.com/research/white-papers/erp- cybersecurity-survey-2017/ revealed that organizations running ERP systems \\"lack both awareness and actions taken towards ERP security\\". ISACA states that \\"there is a shortage of staff members trained in ERP security\\" and security services have the superficial understanding of risks and threats associated with ERP systems. Consequently, security vulnerabilities complicate undertakings such as detecting and subsequent fixing.  Lack of security auditing tools  ERP security audit is done manually as various tools with ERP packages do not provide means for system security auditing. Manual auditing is a complex and time-consuming process that increases the possibility of making a mistake.  Large number of customized settings  The system includes thousands of parameters and fine settings including segregation of duties for transactions and tables, and the security parameters are set for every single system. ERP system settings are customized according to customers' requirements.  Security issues in ERP systems  Security issues occur in ERP systems at different levels.  Network layer  Traffic interception and modification * Absence of data encryption In 2011, Sensepost specialists analyzed DIAG protocol used in SAP ERP system for transferring data from the client to the SAP server. Two utilities were published that allowed to intercept, decrypt, and modify client-server requests containing critical information. This made attacks possible including Man-in-the-middle attack. The second utility operates like a Proxy and was created to identify new vulnerabilities. It allowed modifying requests coming to client and server.ERPScan warns about new vulnerabilities of DIAG protocol in SAP * Sending password in cleartext (SAP J2EE Telnet / Oracle listener old versions) In the SAP ERP system, it is possible to perform administering functions via Telnet protocol, which encrypts passwords. Vulnerabilities in encryption or authentication protocols' * Authentication by hash * XOR password encryption (SAP DIAG) * Imposing the use of outdated authentication protocols * Incorrect authentication protocols Vulnerabilities in protocols (e.g. RFC in SAP ERP and Oracle Net in Oracle E-Business Suite). RFC protocol is used (Remote Function Call) to connect two systems by TCP/IP in SAP ERP. RFC call is a function that enables calling and running a functional module located in a system. The ABAP language that is used for writing business applications for SAP have functions to make RFC calls. Several critical vulnerabilities were found in SAP RFC Library versions 6.x and 7.x:SAP RFC Library Multiple Vulnerabilities http://www.cnet.com/forums/post/7986898c-0a03-43d4-af70-b8427164c8e2 * RFC function \\"RFC_SET_REG_SERVER_PROPERTY\\" allows determining an exclusive use of RFC server.

Exploiting vulnerability allows executing arbitrary code or gain information about RFC server configuration. * Error in RFC function \\"TRUSTED_SYSTEM_SECURITY\\". Exploiting vulnerability allows obtaining information about existing users and groups in RFC server.

SAP data becomes accessible to remote users via NFS an SMB * File access rights. Critical SAP and DBMS Oracle data files have insecure access rights such as 755 and 777 * Insecure hosts settings. In the trusted hosts, servers can be listed and an attacker easily accesses them  Application vulnerabilities  ERP systems transfer more functionality on the web applications level with a lot of vulnerabilities: * Web application vulnerabilities (XSS, XSRF, SQL Injection, Response Splitting, Code Execution) * Buffer overflow and format string in web-servers and application-servers (SAP IGS, SAP Netweaver, Oracle BEA Weblogic) * Insecure privileges for access (SAP Netweaver, SAP CRM, Oracle E-Business Suite)  Role-based access control  In ERP systems, RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) model is applied for users to perform transactions and gain access to business objects.Security for Enterprise Resource Planning Systems http://www.utdallas.edu/~bxt043000/Publications/Journal- Papers/DAS/J46_Security_for_Enterprise_Resource_Planning_Systems.pdf In the model, the decision to grant access to a user is made based on the functions of users, or roles. Roles are a multitude of transactions the user or a group of users performs in the company. Transaction is a procedure of transforming system data, which helps perform this transaction. For any role, there is a number of corresponding users with one or multiple roles. Roles can be hierarchical. After the roles are implemented in the system, transactions corresponding to each role rarely change. The administrator needs to add or delete users from roles. The administrator provides a new user with a membership in one or more roles. When employees leave the organization, the administrator removes them from all the roles.Role-Based Access Controls http://csrc.nist.gov/rbac/ferraiolo-kuhn-92.pdf  Segregation of Duties  Segregation or Separation of duties, also known as SoD, is the concept according to which a user cannot make a transaction without other users (e.g. a user cannot add a new supplier, write out a cheque or pay to a supplier)ISACA Glossary Terms http://www.isaca.org/Knowledge- Center/Lists/ISACA%20Glossary%20Terms/DispForm.aspx?ID=1700 and a risk of fraud is much lower.A risk-based approach to segregation of duties http://www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/EY_Segregation_of_duties/$FILE/EY_Segregation_of_dutie/s.pdf SoD can be implemented by RBAC mechanisms, and a notion of mutually exclusive roles is introduced. For instance, to pay a supplier, one user initiates payment procedure and another accepts it.R. A. Botha and J. H. P. Eloff Separation of Duties for Access Control Enforcement in Workflow Environments In this case, initiating payment and accepting are mutually exclusive roles. Segregation of duties can be either static or dynamic. With static SoD (SSoD), a user cannot belong to two mutually exclusive roles. With dynamic SoD (DSoD), a user does but cannot perform them within one transaction. Both of them have their own advantages. SSoD is simple, while DSoD is flexible.Simple Search http://www.bth.se/fou/cuppsats.nsf/all/52d12689b4758c84c12572a600386f1d/$file/mcs-2006-16.pdf Segregation of Duties is explained in SoD matrix. X and Y matrixes describe system roles. If the two roles are mutually exclusive, there is a flag at the interception of the corresponding rows and columns.

Coire Gabhail (Corrie of the Bounty, or The Hollow of Capture) is a high level glen in the Bidean nam Bian mountain massif to the south of Glen Coe, Highland, Scotland. Its narrow entrance up the hillside conceals the width of the glen beyond, and it is commonly known as the Hidden Valley or Lost Valley of Glencoe. Access from a bridge crossing the River Coe is by a steep path up beside a narrow wooded ravine. Access from Glen Coe, via a wooded ravine between Beinn Fhada and Gearr Aonach, seen over River Coe Coire Gabhail runs southwestwards between the steeply-sided ridges of two of \\"The Three Sisters\\"; on its left, Beinn Fhada (Long Hill) is the eastmost sister, and the central sister Gearr Aonach (Short Ridge) on the right of the corrie forms its western side. Further to the west of Gearr Aonach, Coire nan Lochan is enclosed by Aonach Dubh (Black Ridge). The southern end of Coire Gabhail is marked by the peak of Stob Coire Sgreamhach on the ridge which then slopes down westwards to its low point at Bealach Dearg, then continues up above cliffs to the summit of Bidean nam Bian. History View up to the ridge access at Bealach Dearg, with the peak of Stob Coire Sgreamhach to the left of centre. The flat valley floor, looking north to the narrow entrance, and beyond that the Aonach Eagach ridge on the other side of Glen Coe. This corrie was formed, like Glen Coe, by the movement of glaciers. The principal glacier in the glen below was larger and heavier, and carved out a deeper trough than that of Coire Gabhail. When the glaciers melted a hanging valley was left, high above the glen. Debris from the glaciers left moraines in the mouths of the glens and corries, often resulting in a lake forming behind them. In time these waters found their way through the debris and the lake drained leaving a relatively flat-bottomed alluvial plain which now forms the floor of the corrie. The name Coire Gabhail (Corrie of the Bounty, or The Hollow of Capture) refers to former times when the corrie was used by members of Clan Macdonald to hide cattle and other livestock, whether their own or stolen from others. Like other clans in the area, cattle were the mainstay of their economy, both herding and raiding: young men boastfully sang of getting cows from the Mearns. The wide flat glen is well suited for this purpose since from Glen Coe it appears to be a normal v-shaped glen approached only by a steep narrow gorge. The Macdonalds commonly had feuds with Clan Campbell. This culminated tragically in the 1692 massacre of Glencoe when Campbell soldiers turned on Macdonald clansfolk who fled in a winter blizzard, and a number made their way up to Coire Gabhail while their houses were burned. Those that survived the night then left Glen Coe, fearing the return of the soldiers. Access At the corrie entrance, the top of the path beside the ravine. The path from Glen Coe up beside the gorge into Coire Gabhail is a popular short walk (around each way, ascent ), the path is rough in places involving use of hands on rock for balance or as a step-up, and crossing a river by stepping stones. A car park on the south side of the A82 road, a short distance west of Allt-na-reigh cottage, has a path heading down eastwards to a footbridge across the River Coe. From here, rough stone steps lead up beside the ravine, with views of waterfalls. The top of the path leads out onto the shoulder formed by the ancient landslip, with views and a rough path to the flat corrie floor. Seen from high up near the ridge, the hill path snakes down to the corrie floor. On the other side of Glen Coe, the A82 road passing Allt-na-reigh cottage is visible below the slopes of Am Bodach. This forms a common access route for hill walkers tackling the Stob Coire Sgreamhach and Bidean nam Bian Munros. A rough steep path climbs from the flat corrie bottom traversing the side of Gearr Aonach and gaining height to reach Bealach Dearg. Here rubbly steep rocks and a narrow chute of earthy red scree lead up onto the ridge, with an option of steep broken rocks to the left. Descent is disconcerting, and an alternative is to continue a traverse of the range, returning down by Coire nan Lochan.

Born in Wonogiri, Tan took an early interest in Javanese culture, studying under Mas Ngabehi Mangoenwidjaja of Wonigiri and at the Sunanate of Surakarta. After spending time at a Chinese publishing house in Surakarta, he moved to Kediri and established his own company, publishing at least 279 works, written by a variety of authors and on a wide range of subjects, before his death. Though his son continued the Tan Khoen Swie Publishing Company, it closed soon afterwards. Early life Tan was born in Wonogiri, then part of the Residency of Surakarta. Sources disagree as to the year of his birth. The newspaper Kompas and the writers Sam Setyautama and Suma Mihardja give 1883, while the sinologist Leo Suryadinata gives 1894. As a child, Tan was interested in Javanese culture, and he would often visit the palace in Surakarta. He also studied locally, under Mas Ngabehi Mangoenwidjaja. While still in his youth, Tan moved to Surakarta and began working at the Sie Dhien publishing house. He would later marry Lie Gien Nio; the couple had three children. Tan maintained a personal appearance which was commonly remarked upon. Suryadinata likens Tan's long hair and moustache to those of a \\"modern day hippie\\", while Ardus M. Sawega of Kompas suggests that this hairstyle was intended as a form of resistance against the Dutch colonial government. Publishing Tan later moved to Kediri, in eastern Java, and established his own company, the Boekhandel Tan Khoen Swie (Tan Khoen Swie Publishing Company). Through his company, Tan published works by a variety of writers, including Ranggawarsita, Mangkunegara IV, Ki Padmosusastro, and Yosodipuro. Authors would often come to Kediri from their hometowns‚Äîsome from as far away as Cilacap‚Äîto meet their publisher. Tan would also publish books under his own name, though in a 2002 interview his great-grandson suggested that he did not write these works, but compiled text from a variety of anonymous sources. Every year Tan would release a catalogue of his recent publications; Setyautama and Mihardja write that at least 279 books were released through the company. Tan's publications covered a wide variety of subject matter, including wayang, law, theology, philosophy, and agriculture. The works, which were generally not thick, were written in either Javanese or Malay. Tan's publications, which were outside of the colonial-government run Balai Pustaka network, introduced the works of authors to wider audiences than possible in the traditional method of hand-copying manuscripts. Though printed publications in Javanese had been around since the mid-19th century, such works had remained relatively uncommon in Java, and the Javanese language was still undergoing the transition from oral literature to written literature.

Among the Chinese community of Kediri, he was involved with the Tiong Hoa Hwe Koan and Hoa Chiao Tsing Nien Hui, and served as a teacher at the Hoe Lie Hiap Hwee school for girls. Tan was also known as a mystic, constructing a cave in his yard for meditation. Tan died in 1953; though his son Michael Tanzil (Tan Bian Liong) continued the publishing company, it folded soon after. Tan's family continued to live in the house in Kediri, located at 165 Dhoho street, into the 2000s. Legacy Sawega wrote that Tan's name remained inexorably linked with the popular literature of early 20th century Indonesia. However, owing to a lack of documentation of his publications, in 2002 the Kediri city government organized a team to research Tan's oeuvre and his life. A spokesman for the team stated that they intended to make Tan's former residence into a tourist attraction.

History  In 2007, the AdMeTech Foundation's International Prostate MRI Working Group convened the key global experts, including members of the European Society of Urogenital Radiology (ESUR) and the American College of Radiology (ACR). In March 2009 in Vienna an ESUR Prostate MRI Committee was formed, with the aim to produce minimal and maximal standards for acquisition and reporting of prostate MRI. This standardization was endorsed by the results of a consensus meeting in London in December 2009 Dr. Jelle Barentsz published with the ESUR Prostate MRI Committee the first PI-RADS (v.1) version in December 2011. Following this initiative the ACR, ESUR, and the AdMeTech Foundation formed a Joint Steering Committee, and by 2016 published a second version of PI-RADS (v.2) in European Urology. This paper enabled acceptance of the urologists of prostate MRI and was awarded ‚ÄúBest clinical scientific paper of 2016 in European Urology‚Äù. In 2019 the PI-RADS Steering Committee published an updated version: PI-RADS v2.1. Prostate MRI using PI-RADS to detect clinically significant cancer is now widely by European urologists, as is illustrated with the '2020 EAU Innovators in Urology Award' for Dr. Barentsz.  Purpose  The aim of prostate MRI using PI-RADS is to assess the risk of clinically significant prostate cancer being present. Furthermore, the PI-RADS v2 system is designed to standardize prostate MRI. The focus is especially to provide good image quality and reporting. Performance Various studies have compared the predictive performance of PI-RADS v1 for detecting significant prostate cancer against either image-guided biopsy results (definitive pathology) and/or prostatectomy specimens (histopathology). In a 2015 articles in the Journal of Urology, Thompson reported multi-parametric MRI detection of significant prostate cancer had sensitivity of 96%, specificity of 36%, negative predictive value and positive predictive values of 92% and 52%; when PI-RADS was incorporated into a multivariate analysis (PSA, digital rectal exam, prostate volume, patient age) the area under the curve (AUC) improved from 0.776 to 0.879, p<0.001. A similar paper in European Radiology found that when correlated with histopathology, PI-RADS v2 correctly identified 94-95% of prostate cancer foci ‚â•0.5 mL, but was limited for the assessment of GS ‚â•4+3 (significant) tumors ‚â§0.5 mL; in their series, DCE-MRI offered limited added value to T2WI+DW-MRI. Other applications for which PI-RADS may be useful include prediction of termination of Active Surveillance due to tumor progression/aggressiveness, detection of extraprostatic extension of prostate cancer, and supplemental information when considering whether to re-biopsy patients with a history of previous negative biopsy. PI-RADS v2 is designed to improve detection, characterization and risk stratification in patients suspected of prostate cancer with a goal of better treatment decisions, improved outcomes and simplified reporting. However, multi-center validation trials are needed and expected to lead to modifications in the scoring system.

Working for UBS France in Paris, she has in particular played a decisive role in blowing the whistle on the practices of tax evasion and laundering of tax fraud in organized group of UBS AG (Switzerland) with the complicity of UBS France.  Biography  After studying languages in Lille, France, she worked for TransManche Link (TML, the Channel Tunnel), the embassy of the United States of America, the RC Lens football club and UBS wealth management in Paris. She joined UBS in 1999 where her mission was to develop partnerships with luxury brands and organise client events in France. She has played a key role in blowing the whistle and making public the fact that UBS AG has encouraged tax evasion and money laundering practices with the complicity of UBS France. She has been acting as a whistleblower since 2008 working with French authorities and namely with the French customs. She has also been listened by the Belgian authorities (UBS Belgium being under investigation). She published a book where she explained the practices of UBS (translation into English available in Sept. 2015). Anticor ethics prize 2015 She received the Anticor ethics prize in January 2015 before being invited to testify by the \\"Tax Ruling\\" commission of the European Parliament in Brussels. In June 2015, she was officially invited to an audition at the embassy of Argentina in Paris by Ricardo Echegaray, minister of finance of Argentina and the members of the argentinian \\"commission bicamerale\\" who are working on the mechanism of tax evasion. Stephanie Gibaud has publicly asked Argentina to bring to the G20 the question of the protection of citizens who put themselves at risk for standing up in the public interest. On Septembre 10, 2015, St√©phanie Gibaud was nominated for the Sakharov Prize 2015, together with two other whistleblowers, Edward Snowden and Antoine Deltour.  The UBS case  During 8 years with UBS France, her job was to develop partnerships with luxury houses and to organize events for wealth clients of the bank on the French territory. In 2007, the American banker Bradley Birkenfeld story gets out. His disclosures to the United States government led to a massive fraud investigation against the Swiss bank UBS and other banks that had enabled tax evasion by U.S.taxpayers. All the internal procedures of the bank are thus modified everywhere in the world where UBS has offices. In June 2008, Stephanie Gibaud was requested by her manager to delete the content of her hard drive because the office of the Paris general director was searched. These files contained the names and coordinates of clients and prospects of the bank as well as the names of their respective client advisors in France, Switzerland, Luxembourg, Belgium, Monaco etc. Stephanie Gibaud refused to comply with the instruction, her manager repeated her request and will also ask her to toss the content of her paper archives. A tug-of-war then started and Stephanie Gibaud complained of harassment, exclusion and discrimination. Several executives of the bank confirmed to her that sales service proposed by Swiss client advisors is illegal in France. They further explained that UBS France has implemented a parallel accounting named \\"milk notebook\\" that gathers on a monthly basis the tax evasion transactions of French clients to offshore locations. UBS France tried to dismiss her in 2009 but the dismissal was refused. In 2010, UBS France filled in a complaint against her for defamation but lost their trial. She was finally made redundant in 2012. As a whistleblower by the French labor inspection as of 2008 and by the public prosecutor when filling a complaint against her employer at the end of 2009, Stephanie Gibaud has been listened to by the brigade of repression of the crime against the people (BRPD, part of the French financial brigade) in February 2011 and in March 2015 and several times by the customs, judicial investigations in 2011 and 2012. She was also listened to by Belgian investigators as part of the indictment of UBS Belgium in July 2014 and several times in 2015.http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/french-tax-evasion-_ubs- whistleblower-criticises-banking-s--code-of-silence-/40894464 In 2012, Stephanie Gibaud was listened to by Eric Bocquet, senator and reporter of the tax evasion commission and then by Yann Galut, deputy, in July 2013. Her name appears in the reports of the senate commission of inquiry dated July 17, 2012. and October 17, 2013 In February 2014, she published \\"La Femme qui en savait vraiment trop\\" (the woman who knew too much) at the Cherche Midi publisher. She explains various dysfunctions of the bank, namely about the illegal sales service of the Swiss client advisors on the French territory and tax evasion. Antoine Peillon, investigation journalist, who signed the postface of her book clearly explained that Stephanie Gibaud has been one of the sources of her book entitled \\"Ces 600 milliards qui manquent √† la France\\" (these 600 billions which lack in France), published in March 2013. On march 5, 2015, the labor court ruled in favor of Stephanie Gibaud and condemned UBS to pay a fine of ‚Ç¨30,000 for harassment. The bank did not appeal the case. In May 2015, Stephanie Gibaud and her publisher received a complaint from UBS France for defamation.http://sans-langue-de-bois.eklablog.fr/stephanie-gibaud- lanceuse-d-alerte-ma-vie-apres-l-alerte-a117433046 On May 11, 2015 she was being listened to by the tax ruling committee in the European Parliament in Brussels, invited by Alain Lamassoure. Eva Joly, European deputy, who was seating in the commission, evoked her support to Stephanie Gibaud in an interview given to France Inter (radio) on January 24, 2015. In June 2015, Stephanie Gibaud co-wrote a tribune in L'Express magazine with Nicolas Dupont- Aignan to defend the cause of the whistleblowers. On June 17, 2015, Stephanie Gibaud was officially received by Ricardo Etchegaray (AFIP) at the embassy of Argentina in Paris.

Through his professional career, he contributed to expand what is considered as contemporary art as well as create a dialogue between different cultures and ethnic groups. Biography Son of Paul Martin, curator of the Historical Museum in Strasbourg (Bas-Rhin region in Eastern France), and of Paulette Rieffel, Jean-Hubert Martin studied at Lyc√©e Fustel de Coulanges in the same village before getting his bachelor's degree in Art History at La Sorbonne in Paris. He received his diploma in 1968 before becoming a curator in the French National Museum system in 1969. After a short period of working at the Louvre, he started his career in Paris at the Mus√©e National d'Art Moderne (French National Museum of Modern Art) located at the Palais de Tokyo and directed by Jean Leymarie. There, he organized significant exhibitions of Man Ray, Alberto Burri and Richard Lindner. He played a key role in Francis Picabia‚Äôs revolutionary exhibition in 1976 at the Grand Palais, which showed for the first time his entire work, including his figurative period. Having demonstrated a great interest in the art of the current time, he was named curator of the Contemporary Art department by Pontus Hulten then in charge of the creation of the Centre Pompidou. In this position, he organized exhibitions of the works of Kazimir Malevich, Jean Le Gac and Pierre Molinier as well as ¬´ Paris-Berlin ¬ª and ¬´ Filliou et Pfeufer: La Fondation Po√ØPo√Ø pr√©sente un hommage aux Dogons et aux Rimbauds ¬ª (Filliou and Pfeufer: the Po√ØPo√Ø Foundation pays tribute to the Dogon and the Rimbaud) in 1978, ¬´ Paris- Moscou ¬ª (Paris-Moscow) in 1979 and Man Ray in 1982. That same year, he was named curator of the French pavilion at the Sydney Biennale and became director of the Berne Kunsthalle, directed by Harald Szeeman 20 years before. It is the start of his career as director of European institutions: after working at the Berne Kunsthalle (1982‚Äì1985), he became director of the National Museum of Modern Art in Paris (1987‚Äì1990), artistic director of the Ch√¢teau d‚ÄôOiron (1991‚Äì1994), director of the National Museum of African and Oceanic Art (1994‚Äì1999), general director of the Museum Kunst Palast in D√ºsseldorf (1999‚Äì2006, the museum opened in 2001), and artistic director of the PAC (Padiglione d‚ÄôArte Contemporanea), in Milan. Throughout the course of these experiences, he initiated some important exhibitions which significantly modified museology theory and practice, especially ¬´ A Pierre et Marie ¬ª (To Pierre and Marie ‚Äì Curie), a participatory exhibition in 1982/84, ¬´ Magiciens de la Terre ¬ª (Magicians of the Earth) in 1989, ¬´ Art et publicit√© ¬ª (Art and Advertising) in 1990, ¬´ Alt√§re (Autels) ¬ª in 2002, ¬´ Africa Remix ¬ª in 2004. He developed his views in memorable biennales like ¬´ Universalis ¬ª in S√£o Paulo in 1996 or ¬´ Partages d‚Äôexotisme ¬ª (Exotic Sharing) in Lyon (Rhones- Alpes Region in France) in 2000. In 2006, he was named Project Manager within the French National Museum system at the Culture and Communication Ministry. He occupied that position until 2010. Since then, he continues to develop his practice as an independent curator for internationally acclaimed exhibitions: ¬´ Dali ¬ª at the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris in 2012, ¬´ Theatre du Monde ¬ª (Theatre of the World) at the Museum of Old and New Art in Hobart in Tasmania and at the Maison Rouge-foundation Antoine de Galbert in Paris in 2013 and ¬´ Le Maroc contemporain ¬ª (Contemporary Morocco), at the Institut du Monde Arabe in Paris in 2014. He also directed the FRAME (French Regional & American Museum Exchange) in France in 2008 and 2009. He is currently president of the SAM award for Contemporary Art selection committee (since 2010), president of the Palais de Tokyo steering committee (since 2011) and president of the artistic, scientific and cultural council at the Cit√© de la C√©ramique (Ceramic museum) in S√®vres (since 2015). Works Born in the heart of Europe and raised in a bicultural environment, Jean-Hubert Martin supported the Europeanization of art, and then its true globalization, exposing artists of the entire world and setting up convincing traveling exhibitions.https://www.msu.edu/course/ha/491/buchlohwholeearth.pdf After Claude Levi-Strauss, he recognizes the value of cultures with no writing skills. He looks to develop new lines of inquiry beyond the Western way of thinking. He initiates new exhibition practices creating visual correspondences instead of categories and classifications. This opens new perspectives for institutions and artists alike. In 1989 \\"Magiciens de la terre\\" (Magicians of the Earth) is thought to be the first truly international exhibition. For the first time in Europe Western art and art from the Third World were placed at the same level.http://www.stedelijkstudies.com/journal/revisiting-magiciens-de-la- terre/ In the tradition of the Dada movement, \\"Magiciens de la terre\\" (Magicians of the Earth), allowed unknown artists to come to the forefront. Jean-Hubert Martin detects in Dada the first signs of \\"postmodernism\\" and of the extension of the idea of art. Moreover, his research leads to other new perspectives, notably he reactivated the practice of the \\"cabinet de curiosit√©\\", wherein the esthetic pleasure mingles with the scientific interest, for the Chateau d‚ÄôOiron. Jean-Hubert Martin was a key actor in the discovery of the Russian \\"avant-gardes\\" in Europe, especially through the exhibition and publication of the works of Ilya and Emilia Kabakov. He also brought forward a number of cutting edge French artists from the beginning of their careers, among these: Christian Boltanski, Daniel Buren, Bertrand Lavier, Annette Messager and Sarkis.

Populist right wing groups have shared a number of causes, which typically include opposition to globalisation, criticism of immigration and multiculturalism, and opposition to the European Union. The ideological spectrum of the radical right extends from right-wing populism to white nationalism and neo-fascism. Terminology and definition The Friedrich Ebert Foundation, in a 2011 book, defines the terms \\"right wing extremist\\" and \\"right wing populist\\" differently. In 1996, the Dutch political scientist Cas Mudde noted that in most European countries, the terms \\"radical right\\" and \\"extreme right\\" were used interchangeably. He cited Germany as an exception, noting that among political scientists in that nation, the term \\"radical right\\" (Rechsradikalismus) was used in reference to those right-wing groups which were outside the political mainstream but which did not threaten \\"the free democratic order\\"; the term was thus used in contrast to the \\"extreme right\\" (Rechsextremen), which referred to groups which did threaten the constitutionality of the state and could therefore be banned under German law. The term \\"radical right\\" originated in U.S. political discourse, where it was applied to various anti-communist groups active in the 1950s era of McCarthyism. The term and accompanying concept then entered Western Europe through the social sciences. Conversely, the term \\"right-wing extremism\\" developed among European scholars, particularly those in Germany, to describe right-wing groups that developed in the decades following the Second World War, such as the West German National Democratic Party and the French Poujadists. This term then came to be adopted by some scholars in the U.S. Defining Europe's populist right In his study of the movement in Europe, David Art defined the term \\"radical right\\" as referring to \\"a specific type of far right party that began to emerge in the late 1970s\\"; as Art used it, \\"far right\\" was \\"an umbrella term for any political party, voluntary association, or extra-parliamentary movement that differentiates itself from the mainstream right\\". Most commentators have agreed that these varied radical right parties have a number of common characteristics. Givens stated that the two characteristics shared by these radical rights groups were: :\\"They take an anti-immigrant stance by proposing stronger immigrant controls and the repatriation of unemployed immigrants, and they call for a national (i.e., citizens only) preference in social benefits and employment (\\"welfare chauvinism\\"). :In contrast to earlier extreme right or fascist parties, they work within a country's political and electoral system. Although they do not have the goal of tearing down the current political system, they are anti- establishment. They consider themselves \\"outsiders\\" in the party system, and therefore not tainted by government or mainstream parties' scandals.\\" In 2000, Minkenberg characterised the \\"radical right\\" as \\"a political ideology, the core element of which is a myth of a homogeneous nation, a romantic and populist ultranationalism which is directed against the concept of liberal and pluralistic democracy and its underlying principles of individualism and universalism. The contemporary radical right does not want to return to pre- democratic regimes such as monarchy or feudalism. It wants government by the people, but in terms of ethnocracy instead of democracy.\\" Journalist Nick Robins-Early characterised the European radical right as focusing on \\"sometimes vitriolic anti-Euro, anti-immigrant sentiment, as well as renewed security fears\\" within European nations. According to political scientist Andrej Zaslove, populist radical right parties \\"employ an anti‚Äêstate, anti‚Äêbureaucratic, anti‚Äêelite, anti‚ÄêEuropean Union political message.\\" The European migrant crisis has caused a significant uptick in the populist support for right-wing parties. A 2016 article in the New York Times argued that the \\"once-unthinkable\\" British vote to leave the EU is the result of \\"Populist anger against the established political order\\". Support base The 2005 paper in the European Journal of Political Research argues that the two groups most likely to vote for populist right parties are \\"blue-collar workers ‚Äì who support extensive state intervention in the economy ‚Äì and owners of small businesses ‚Äì who are against such state intervention\\". A 2014 article by the Friedrich Ebert Foundation argued that economic inequality is growing the gap \\"between the winners of globalisation and its losers. The first group live in urban areas, have relatively stable jobs and access to modern communications and transport, but fears nevertheless that it will soon share the fate of the second group. The second group, meanwhile, are threatened by unemployment or stuck in poorly paid and precarious jobs. They belong to the working class or consider themselves part of the lower middle class and fear ‚Äì for themselves or their children ‚Äì (further) social decline. Such people live in de-industrialised areas, or rural or semi-urban areas, on the periphery of globalised metropolises to which they have no access.\\" Scholars have argued that neoliberalism has led to European \\"social and economic insecurity\\" in the working and middle classes, leading to the growth of right wing populism. Minkenberg termed the supporters of the radical right \\"modernization losers\\", in that they are from the sectors of society whose \\"social and cultural capital is shrinking and they are intent on defending it against encroachments on their traditional entitlements.\\" He described this base as those who exhibit \\"unease, rigid thinking, authoritarian attitudes and traditional values ‚Äî all of which reinforce each other.\\" Connections and links French radical right protesters in Calais hold banners saying \\"Reimmigrate\\" and \\"Diversity is a code word for white genocide\\", 8 November 2015 A number of radical right elements express a desire for fascist or neo-Nazi rule in Europe. Political scientist Michael Minkenberg stressed that the radical right was \\"a modern phenomenon\\", stating that it is only \\"vaguely connected\\" to previous right-wing movements because it has \\"undergone a phase of renewal, as a result of social and cultural modernisation shifts in post-war Europe.\\" As such he opined that describing it using terms such as \\"fascism\\" or \\"neo- fascism\\", which were closely linked the right-wing movements of the early 20th century, was an \\"increasingly obsolete\\" approach. The Swedish Neo-Nazi Nordic Resistance Movement group marching through Stockholm, 2007 Minkenberg argued that the radical right groups in Eastern Europe, including in Eastern Germany, were distinct from their counterparts in Western Europe. He added that \\"the East European radical right is more reverse-oriented than its Western counterpart, i.e. more antidemocratic and more militant\\" and that because of the relatively new establishment of liberal democracy in Eastern Europe, violence still could be used as a political tool by the Eastern radical right. Jeffrey Kaplan and Leonard Weinberg's 1998 book The Emergence of a Euro- American Radical Right says that populist right wing movements are supported by extra-parliamentary groups with electorally unpalatable views, such as Christian Identity movements, anti-Semitic conspiracy theories, the promotion of scientific racism and Holocaust denial, and neo-Nazi economic theories like Strasserism. Connection to U.S. radical right In 1998, the political scientists Jeffrey Kaplan and Leonard Weinberg argued that the interaction of right-wingers and the transmission of ideas between right-wing groups in Western Europe and the United States was common, having been aided by the development of the internet. They believed that in the late 20th century a discernible \\"Euro-American radical right\\" that would promote a trans-national white identity politics, promoting populist grievance narratives around groups who feel besieged by non-white peoples through multiculturalism. This concept of a unified \\"white\\" race was not always explicitly racialist, in many cases instead being conceived of as being a bond created by \\"cultural affinity and a sense of common historical experience and a shared ultimate destiny\\". Kaplan and Weinberg also identified differences in the radical right movements of Europe and North America. They noted that European radical right parties had been able to achieve electoral successes in a way that their American counterparts had failed to do. Instead, radical right activists in the U.S. had attempted to circumvent the restrictions of the two-party system by joining right-wing trends within the Republican Party. They also noted that legal restrictions on such groups differed in the two continents; in the U.S., the First Amendment protected the free speech of radical right groups, while in most West European nations there were laws prohibiting hate speech and (in several countries) Holocaust denial, thus forcing European radical right groups to present a more moderate image.

These extra-parliamentary rightist groups are often religious in nature, affiliated either with Christian Identity or with Odinism, reflecting a greater racial mysticism than was present in earlier right-wing movements. Such groups often believe that Western governments are under the control of a Zionist Occupation Government (ZOG), thus expressing explicitly anti-Semitic views. Such groups are also less enthusiastic about capitalism and free markets as the radical right political parties are, instead being influenced by Strasserism and favouring greater state control of the economy. Such extra-parliamentary groups often exhibit ritual or ceremonial practices to commemorate perceived past achievements of the right-wing, for instance by marking Adolf Hitler's birthday or the death date of Rudolf Hess. They are also associated with violent activities, with such violence often being utilised not just for political aims but also as an expressive and enjoyable activity. There are also more intellectually-oriented radical right organisations which hold conferences and publish journals devoted to the promotion of scientific racism and Holocaust denial. Material promoting Holocaust denial is typically published in the United Kingdom or United States and then smuggled into continental Europe, where the publication of such material is widely illegal. Examples A 2015 study on modern populism by Kirk A. Hawkins of Brigham Young University used human coding to rate the level of perceived populist rhetoric in party manifestos and political speeches. Parties with high populism scores included the British National Party, the Swiss People's Party, the German NPD, the French National Front, the Belgian People's Party, the Spanish National Democracy, the Swedish Sweden Democrats, The Dutch PVV and Forum for Democracy. The political scientists Robert Ford and Matthew Goodwin characterised the UK Independence Party as being on the radical right.

It lies about 4 kilometres east of the town of Todtnau.  Location and topography  The dome of the Silberberg is visible immediately left of the Herzogenhorn (left, above the cable car cabins) The central highlands of the Southern Black Forest are formed by the Feldberg region () in the north and the group of mountains around the Herzogenhorn in the south, both separated by the Feldberg Pass and the deep valley of Trogtal through which the upper Wiese runs. The rocky dome of the Silberberg drops steeply to the north by a good 550 metres forming one of the highest mountain faces in the Feldberg region. To the southeast the mountain is bounded by the upper reaches of the Pr√§gbach. The latter runs parallel to the Wiese, but 400 metres above it, the southeastern mountainside descending only relatively gently. It transitions to the high pastures of the upper Pr√§gbach valley. The forested northern mountainside is divided by cirque-like niches and craggy ridges that are like ar√™tes in places.  Rocks and minerals  The Silberberg, like the whole upper Wiese valley is mostly made of paragneisses. Also present here, are several vein-line porphyry deposits, which were probably formed towards the end of the Variscan mountain building phase,Mineralienatlas Deutschland, retrieved 5 May 2012 and amphibolite. Both are very resistant to weathering and tend, therefore, to form crags. A number of mineral lodes run through the Silberberg with a total length of several kilometres and of medium thickness up to 1.2 metres. In the quartz, fluorspar, baryte, calcite and dolomite veins are galena, chalcopyrite and silver ores. The Silberberg is also the only place in the Black Forest to date where tremolite has been found.  Mining  The name of the mountain recalls the silver mining of bygone years. It is part of the Todtnau mining region, in which silver was mined as early as the Middle Ages. The oldest record of ore mines on the Silberberg dates to 1028. In the western, neighbouring cirque of Zimmerwinkel the Dr. Tholus Brunnen gallery was worked by the Gewerkschaft Finstergrund from 1968 until 1970 in order to extract fluorite and baryte.Mineralienatlas Deutschland, retrieved 5 May 2012  Tourism  A rock path runs up the steep, northern slopes of the Silberberg that was originally blazed by the Black Forest Club but, like the Alpine Path on the Feldberg has been abandoned. The very varied footpath has a few exposed sections but is still passible.

A picture of a bruise above McMillan's right breast was taken a day after she was arrested, and was introduced as evidence to support her claims. However, McMillan's medical records failed to support this, with the prosecutor emphasizing \\"nowhere in records from doctors, a social worker or a psychologist who treated McMillan in the hours after her arrest is there an allegation that a police officer grabbed McMillan's breast\\".

Officer Bovell testified he encountered Ms. McMillan flailing her arms and shouting curses at a female officer, who was never located and did not testify. Officer Bovell said he told Ms. McMillan to leave the park, and when she refused, put her hand on her shoulder to steer her out. Bovell testified \\"I remember her saying to someone: 'Are you filming this? Are you filming this?'\\" before \\"crouching down and lunging with her elbow and hitting me in the face\\". A video supported his account, showing McMillan \\"bending her knees, then throwing her right elbow into the officer's eye\\". The video also shows her as she \\"lurches forward, runs a few steps, then is tackled by several officers\\". McMillan claimed to have suffered a seizure after \\"being wrestled to the ground during her arrest\\". Prosecutors claimed that McMillan faked a seizure in order to resist arrest, noting that four separate doctors failed to diagnose McMillan with any form of seizure following her arrest. Assisting defense attorney Erin Choi noted that McMillan's chief complaint in the hospital was \\"difficulty breathing\\", rating her pain on a 1-10 scale \\"a 1 or a 2\\", but telling another doctor two days later that it was a \\"10\\". An attending physician claimed that McMillan had told him she was \\"doing well at this time, apart from current legal status\\". An officer testified that McMillan was \\"writhing back and forth and complaining she couldn't breathe\\", so she \\"gave McMillan a coat and pulled down her lime-green miniskirt to prevent her from exposing herself, and held her head to prevent her from hitting it on the pavement while she writhed on the ground\\".

Upon admittance into the order, she assumed the name of \\"Maria Ludovica\\". She initially served in Italy, but moved to Argentina where she devoted her time to children and the children's hospital in La Plata. She died there in 1962. Pope John Paul II beatified her in 2004. Life Antonina De Angelis was born in San Gregorio, Italy on 24 October 1880 as the first of eight children and was baptized on the date of her birth. As a child, De Angelis enjoyed nature and she worked daily in the fields near her home. Somewhat reserved, she decided to pursue a religious vocation. She entered the congregation of the Daughters of Our Lady of Mercy on 17 November 1904 and was granted the name of \\"Maria Ludovica\\". On 14 November 1907, she left Italy for Buenos Aires, Argentina, traveling by boat and arriving on 4 December. She was assigned in 1908 to work as the manager of the kitchen, linens and pantry for the Children's Hospital of La Plata (now known as Sor Mar√≠a Ludovica Hospital de Ni√±os), When she arrived at the hospital, it had only 60 beds and two wooden chambers. Sister Maria Ludovica was later made the supervisor and head administrator of the children's hospital. She focused on expanding services for the children, securing funds to build additional patient and operating rooms, acquire medical equipment, and construct a convalescent center. She also was instrumental in the building of a chapel and creation of a farm to provide fresh produce for the children of the hospital. She was also instrumental in securing a grant from the Municipality of La Plata to maintain the hospital, which guaranteed its longevity. After her death, the city took over the administration of the facility. De Angelis died in 1962 in La Plata. Beatification Her beatification began when the current Superior of the children's hospital, Sister Emilia Paternosto, was told of \\"divine favor\\" some had received when praying to Sister Maria Ludovica. Paternosto initiated the process of canonization in 1985 and the following year Antonio Quarracino, Archbishop of La Plata, elevated the case to the diocesan level. After investigations were completed, the title of Servant of God was conferred upon her in 1990. In 1992, after claims by a mother that her daughter with spina bifida was able to walk after intercession from Sister Maria Ludovica, a team of doctors examined the evidence and the Vatican concluded the healing was \\"scientifically inexplicable\\". In 2001, she was declared to have lived a life of heroic virtue and was granted the title of Venerable by Pope John Paul II. On November 18, 2003, the Congregation for the Causes of Saints signed the authenticity of a miracle and John Paul II approved the findings the following month. He beatified her on 3 October 2004. Claims of a second miraculous healing and investigation of the claim began in 2007 and investigation was still on-going in 2010.

He served as a Member of Parliament for the Grand National Assembly from 1999 to 2011 and again from 2015 to 2018 as a member of the Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP). Early life Fƒ±rat was born in the district of Kahta in Adyaman on 8 August 1943. His grandfather, Hacƒ± Bedir Fƒ±rat, was an MP during the first, second and third Parliaments of the Turkish Republic, serving from Malatya for the first and second and from Kars for the third Parliament. His uncle H√ºseyin Fehmi Fƒ±rat was a Democratic Party politician who also served as an MP for three terms. His cousin, Mehmet Sƒ±rrƒ± Turanlƒ±, was an MP for Adƒ±yaman in the 11th Parliament and was later also a senator. In Kurdish, the name 'Dengir' means \\"great voice\\" while the name 'M√Ær' means bey (local leader). Mir Mehmet was the name of one of Fƒ±rat's forefathers. From a Kurdish background, Fƒ±rat's grandfather was given a medal by Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk.http://www.radikal.com.tr/haber.php?haberno=223380&tarih;=06/06/2007 After graduation, Fƒ±rat served as a freelance lawyer, a farmer and an export tradesman. He was a member of the Executive Board of the Mediterranean Exporters Association. Political career Felicity Party, 1999-2001 Fƒ±rat was elected as a Member of Parliament for Adyaman from the Islamist orientated Virtue Party (FP) in the 1999 general election. The party saw a split between traditionalist Islamists and moderate conservatives over the course of the Parliament, with a party leadership election contested by the most modern Abdullah G√ºl and traditionalist incumbent Recai Kutan yielding a victory for Kutan. In the 2000 presidential election, Fƒ±rat put his name forward as a candidate, but withdrew and was defeated by cross-party candidate Ahmet Necdet Sezer. The party was closed down in 2001 by the Constitutional Court for violating state secularism, after which traditionalist MPs formed the Felicity Party (SP) while moderate conservatives formed the Justice and Development Party (AKP). Fƒ±rat was one of the founding members of the AKP and joined the party after the FP's dissolution. Justice and Development Party, 2001-14 As one of the founders of the AKP, Fƒ±rat served as a Deputy leader of the party under Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan. He was elected in the 2002 general election as a Member of Parliament for Mersin and re-elected in the 2007 general election as a Member of Parliament for Adana. He did not contest the 2011 general election. Despite the AKP forming a majority government in both 2002 and 2007, Fƒ±rat was not made a Minister despite being one of the AKP's founders. In an interview given to the New York Times in 2008, Fƒ±rat caused controversy after criticising Atat√ºrk for his secular revolutions for causing a 'trauma' within society. Serving as the party's deputy leader, Fƒ±rat resigned from this role in November 2008 after accusations of corruption during a live debate with Kemal Kƒ±lƒ±√ßdaroƒülu, the parliamentary group leader of the Republican People's Party. He resigned from the AKP completely on 27 July 2014, positing his decision on Facebook. Peoples' Democratic Party, 2015-2019 Fƒ±rat defected from the AKP to the HDP in February 2015, with the intention of running for Parliament from Mersin as a HDP candidate. He claimed that the HDP could become the main opposition party in future elections. His defection was one of the high-profile defections that the AKP had suffered to the HDP, which was perceived to be taking large portions of the AKP vote in the Kurdish south-east of Turkey. He was elected to Parliament in the June 2015 general election after his party succeeded in surpassing the 10% election threshold needed to gain seats in Parliament. He was subsequently put forward by the HDP as their candidate for Parliamentary Speaker in the June‚ÄìJuly 2015 speaker elections, but was eliminated in the third round. He died on 11 July 2019, aged 75, from lung cancer.

Many of the victims, who refused to cooperate with the authorities, were of high-society stock. The Pierre Hotel, located in mid-Manhattan, is rated as one of the most luxurious in the world, hosting celebrities, affluent personages, and high ranking statesmen. Furthermore, The Pierre Hotel Affair sets forth and reconstructs how fourteen months prior to the caper, two of the gunmen, Robert Bobby Comfort and Sammy the Arab Nalo, held captive and robbed the Italian actress, Sophia Loren. Comfort and Nalo relieved her of approximately $520,000 in jewelry. (Refer to New York Magazine April 30, 1973 issue page 46).

The day of attacks was dubbed \\"Bloody Friday\\" by Anglophone media and \\"Black Friday\\" () among Francophone media in Europe and North Africa. One attack at a Tunisian beach resort killed 39; a bombing at a Shia mosque in Kuwait City killed 27 and injured several; while in Koban√Æ a large-scale massacre by ISIL resulted in more than 223 civilians murdered, in line with over 79 assailants (including 13 suicide bombers) and 23 Kurdish militiamen, dubbed the second-largest massacre by ISIL since summer 2014; a suicide bombing by ISIL in Al-Hasakeh, also in Syria, resulted in 20 fatalities; Al-Shabaab militants killed 70 African Union soldiers from Burundi in Leego, Somalia; finally, one man was decapitated, while several were injured during the Saint-Quentin-Fallavier attack in France. Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant senior leader Abu Mohammad al-Adnani had released an audio message three days earlier encouraging militants everywhere to attack during the month of Ramadan.Terrorist Attacks in France, Tunisia and Kuwait Kill Dozens ‚Äì The New York Times ‚Äì 26 June 2015 ISIL also claimed responsibility for the attacks in Tunisia, Syria and Kuwait. According to The Guardian, there is no evidence that the attacks were coordinated among the perpetrators, but their timing on a single day received significant coverage. One security analyst said the attacks added up to \\"an unprecedented day for terrorism.\\" In total, more than 403 people died and 336 were injured, not including any attackers involved. Background On 7 June, the Institute for the Study of War released a statement predicting that simultaneous terror attacks would take place at around 29 June, marking the one-year anniversary of the terrorist group ISIL declaring itself to be a state. The statement noted that the ISIL's precursor organization Al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) had a history of elevating violence during Ramadan. The paper said that ISIL was \\"likely preparing a surge of operations\\" during Ramadan to stoke regional sectarian and religious war, and to create military momentum. The paper argued that AQI had a history of promoting sectarian violence though the 2006 al-Askari mosque bombing, and that ISIL would use the movement of religious pilgrims during Ramadan to infiltrate soldiers into Shi'a areas, and also \\"likely target Shi‚Äôa populations outside of Iraq and Syria, particularly in Yemen and Saudi Arabia and possibly further abroad.\\" Three days before the attack, ISIL's Abu Mohammad al-Adnani called on jihadists to \\"make the month of Ramadan a calamity on the apostates\\" by initiating attacks and seeking \\"martyrdom\\". The three attacks in France, Kuwait and Tunisia were launched early on Friday morning. Question of coordination of the attacks The attacks took place three days before the one-year anniversary of ISIL declaring itself a caliphate on 29 June 2014. Writing for The Guardian, journalist Kareem Shaheen wrote that, \\"There was no evidence that the near-simultaneous attacks were coordinated, but they highlighted the growing threat of attacks by jihadists, some of them inspired by Isis rhetoric, across Europe, Africa and the Middle East.\\" British professor Sajjan Gohel, the international security director for the Asia- Pacific Foundation think tank, said the attacks added up to \\"an unprecedented day for terrorism,\\" and that while details of the planning were still unclear, it involved individuals \\"buying into the ... doctrine that groups like ISIS articulate.\\" They also occurred on Friday, during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, following an ISIL leader's call to make the month of Ramadan a time of \\"calamity for the infidels.\\" Journalist Vivienne Walt wrote for Time that the attacks in France, Kuwait and Syria left \\"an impression that the group had adopted a new tactic of launching punitive external attacks rather than just focusing on state-building and territorial acquisition.\\" The three attacks plus the killings in Koban√Æ \\"do not appear to have any military purpose and may suggest that ISIS has decided to pursue its war for territory in tandem with its war against the world of unbelievers, which includes almost everyone,\\" Walt wrote. Long-term impact On 27 June, Politico reported that U.S. intelligence agencies were reassessing their previous characterization of ISIL as a ‚Äúregional threat.‚Äù In a February 2015 report, Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper classified ISIL as a \\"regional threat\\" and wrote: ‚ÄúIn an attempt to strengthen its self-declared caliphate, ISIL probably plans to conduct operations against regional allies, Western facilities, and personnel in the Middle East.‚Äù U.S. Congressman Ed Royce, the chairman of the U.S. House Committee on Foreign Affairs, told Politico, ‚ÄúThese attacks show that the [ISIL] threat is spreading well beyond Iraq and Syria. A continued safe-haven there means more attacks across the region, Europe and even here at home.... We also must destroy the online messaging that attracts so many young people with the counter message that [ISIL] offers no peace, no community, and no future.‚Äù Attacks Koban√Æ On 25 June, ISIL fighters launched an attack on the Kurdish-held town of Koban√Æ, Syria, infiltrating the city en-masse and killing scores of civilians with guns and a series of suicide bombs. The attacks resulted in over 230 civilians dead, as well as 79 ISIL assailants and 23 YPG militia men. It was named the second largest civilian massacre by ISIL since it declared itself a caliphate on 29 June 2014. Saint-Quentin-Fallavier On 26 June, Islamist delivery driver Yassine Salhi decapitated a man and rammed a company van into gas cylinders at a gas factory near Lyon, causing an explosion and injuring two others. Three other people, including Salhi's wife and sister, were later arrested. Kuwait City A suicide bombing took place on 26 June in Kuwait at a Shia mosque. The attack was claimed by ISIL. The Emir of Kuwait visited the location of the incident minutes after it happened.H.H The Emir arrives the incident's location ‚Äì Arabic Kuwaiti al-Watan newspaper ‚Äì 26 June 2015 The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) has claimed responsibility for the attack, and called the perpetrator \\"Abu Sulaiman al-Muwahhid.\\" Sousse The Sousse attacks occurred on 26 June in the Tunisian town of Sousse. At least 39 people, mostly European tourists, were killed when an armed gunman attacked two hotels on the beach. ISIL claimed responsibility for the attack. Reports have since surfaced of alleged involvement and co-operation between the gunmen Seifeddine Rezgui and Ansar al-Sharia in Tunisia.

Ulius Louis Amoss (1895‚Äì1961) was a US intelligence officer who wrote the original essay on Leaderless Resistance in the 1950s after he retired and was upset with what he wrote was bad operational practices of the Central Intelligence Agency. According to Amoss, resistance cells with members who made contact with U.S. intelligence agents or √©migr√© ethnic anticommunist organizations were being penetrated by Soviet and Soviet Bloc intelligence agencies, broken up, the members tortured, and sometimes executed. Therefore, Amoss urged U.S. intelligence policy be shifted from an old-fashioned hierarchical model such as that used in World War II with resistance organizations, and refocused on encouraging ‚ÄúLeaderless Resistance to destabilize and subvert Soviet occupation of Eastern European countries such as Poland, the example he cites in detail in his essay. Amoss warned that traditional hierarchical underground cells organized by the CIA in Eastern Europe were being penetrated and liquidated by Soviet and Eastern Bloc counterintelligence operations. Amoss: ‚Äúwe do not need ‚Äòleaders‚Äô; we need leading ideas. These ideas would produce leaders. The masses would produce them and the ideas would be their inspiration. Therefore, we must create these ideas and convey them to the restless peoples concerned with them.‚Äù In 1961 leaflets were airdropped over Cuba by anti-Castro Cuban exiles and their allies with close ties to the Central Intelligence Agency. The leaflets used the concept of Leaderless Resistance and called for the creation of ‚ÄúPhantom Cells‚Äù (Celulas Fantasmas). There was no apparent connection between Amoss and the leaflets, according to Michael Paulding, who is writing a book on an early OSS figure and has studied Amoss and his work. Amoss died in November 1961, a few months after the failed CIA-orchestrated Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba. Amoss's Leaderless Resistance essay is republished posthumously in 1962 in the INFORM newsletter, having been rewritten from the 1953 original by a freelancer, according to Paulding.Chip Berlet, Ulius Louis Amoss, Civil Liberties Hall of Fame, Defending Dissent Foundation, 2015 References 1895 births 1961 deaths Military intelligence Guerrilla warfare United States Army soldiers ","title":"Ulius Louis Amoss"},{"id":"47084586","text":"Sutoc (possibly from Quechua sut'u drop; point, -q a suffix, \\"drippy\\" or \\"point-shaped\\") is a mountain in the Urubamba mountain range in the Andes of Peru.
