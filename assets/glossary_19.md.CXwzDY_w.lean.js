Career Burton was built for the Tacoma and Burton Navigation Company, whose principals had once been partners with the owners of a rival steamer Norwood on runs from Tacoma to points on Vashon Island. Burton was intended to compete with Norwood. Once Burton was completed, daily competition for fares meant both steamers were racing each other from landing to landing. Norwood was soon replaced with the faster and newer Vashon, and the racing continued with Burton every day until 1907, when Burton was replaced on the route by Magnolia. Burton was sold to the Kitsap County Transportation Company (KCTC) in 1912. By 1924, Burton had been taken out of service, and was laid up in Gig Harbor, and in that year a fire started on board and destroyed the vessel.

History Old Chapel was originally constructed in Richardson Romanesque-style between 1884 and 1887 at a cost of $ (equivalent to $ in today's dollars), to serve as a library, museum, and assembly hall. The building was designed by Worcester architect Stephen C. Earle, and is a roughly square stone structure with a tower at its southeast corner. It is made primarily of granite, with sandstone trim and a slate roof. The tower features an open belfry with rounded arches, above which are gabled peaks with clock faces, and a diagonally set four-sided steeple at the top. According to the school, John F. Kennedy supposedly spoke at the Chapel during his 1952 U.S. Senate campaign, although this has never been confirmed. The chapel's original bell, \\"Old Aggie,\\" was added in 1892, but has since been replaced by 44 carillon bells. Although the tower underwent a $1.65 million renovation in 1999, Old Chapel has been uninhabited since 1996, when the University of Massachusetts Minuteman Marching Band moved out due to unsafe conditions within the structure. Since then, a movement amongst alumni was created to further renovate the interior of the building so that the structure could be used again. Restoration of Old Chapel began in 2015 after a 2013 campaign by Chancellor Kumble R. Subbaswamy to restore and repurpose the interior of the structure. This included a nomination by Preserve UMass to place the structure on the National Register of Historic Places, which occurred on May 11, 2015.

Located in the village of Tiltonsville along the Ohio River shoreline of Jefferson County, the mound is a prehistoric earthwork and archaeological site, and it has been named a historic site.Owen, Lorrie K., ed. Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 2. St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 800. During the nineteenth century, white residents of the village of Tiltonsville founded a cemetery around a small hill on the northern side of their village. A round, cone-shaped knoll with a tree growing from its top, the hill is surrounded by gravestones as old as the 1870s. At some point since that time, erosion of the hillside revealed human bones, including a skull with evidence of artificial cranial deformation. This practice was common among the prehistoric Adena culture; consequently, the bones allowed archaeologists to determine that the hill was a burial mound built by the Adena, who are believed to have inhabited the area at some point between 500 BC and AD 500., Ohio Historical Society, 2007. Accessed 2011-04-13. Although the Hodgen's Cemetery Mound has never been excavated, it is a significant archaeological site — disproportionately large numbers of Adena burials with cranial deformation were societal élites who were typically buried with significant grave goods, and the intact state of the mound means that its original contents are likely to remain in their place. The mound has been disturbed by the digging of modern graves into its southwestern side, but the graves have not deformed the mound's general conical shape significantly. In 1975, the Hodgen's Cemetery Mound was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, qualifying because of its archaeological value in the local area. It is one of two Jefferson County archaeological sites on the Register, along with the Speedway Mound in nearby Rayland.

Previously he had been awarded the Distinguished Service Cross. Svehla joined the Army in 1951.Service Profile By June 12, 1952, Svehla was a private first class serving in Korea as a rifleman with Company F, 32nd Infantry Regiment, 7th Infantry Division. On that day, his platoon came under heavy fire and he charged forward to attack the enemy. When a grenade landed amidst his group, he smothered the blast with his body in order to protect those around him. He was killed in the explosion. His remains have never been recovered. For these actions, Svehla was awarded the Medal of Honor by President Barack Obama on May 2 during a White House ceremony. His sisters Dorothy Mathews and Sylvia Svehla accepted the medal on his behalf. Also receiving a Medal of Honor at the ceremony was the family of Private First Class Anthony T. Kahoʻohanohano, a fellow 7th Infantry Division soldier killed in the Korean War. A White House press release describes Svehla's actions: > Coming under heavy fire and with his platoon's attack beginning to falter, > Private First Class Svehla leapt to his feet and charged the enemy > positions, firing his weapon and throwing grenades as he advanced. > Disregarding his own safety, he destroyed enemy positions and inflicted > heavy casualties. When an enemy grenade landed among a group of his > comrades, without hesitation and undoubtedly aware of the extreme danger, he > threw himself on the grenade.  Medal of Honor Citation  The President of the United States of America, in the name of Congress, takes pleasure in presenting the Medal of Honor to (Posthumously) to Private First Class Henry Svehla (ASN: RA-21748254), United States Army, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations against an armed enemy of the United Nations while serving with Company F, 2d Battalion, 32d Infantry Regiment, 7th Infantry Division. Private First Class Svehla distinguished himself by extraordinary heroism in action against enemy aggressor forces at Pyongony, Korea, on 12 June 1952. That afternoon, while Private First Class Svehla and his platoon were patrolling a strategic hill to determine enemy strength and positions, they were subjected to intense enemy automatic weapons and small arms fire at the top of the hill. Coming under heavy fire, the platoon's attack began to falter. Realizing the success of mission and the safety of the remaining troops were in peril, Private First Class Svehla leapt to his feet and charged the enemy positions, firing his weapon and throwing grenades as he advanced. In the face of this courage and determination, the platoon rallied to attack with renewed vigor. Private First Class Svehla, utterly disregarding his own safety, destroyed enemy positions and inflicted heavy casualties, when suddenly, fragments from a mortar round exploding nearby seriously wounded him in the face. Despite his wounds, Private First Class Svehla refused medical treatment and continued to lead the attack. When an enemy grenade landed among a group of his comrades, Private First Class Svehla, without hesitation and undoubtedly aware of extreme danger, threw himself upon the grenade. During this action, Private First Class Svehla was mortally wounded. Private First Class Svehla's extraordinary heroism and selflessness at the cost of his own life, above and beyond the call of duty, are in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflect great credit upon himself, his unit and the United States Army.

The company was founded in 1898 as the Hansen Transportation Company. Hansen Transportation Pier 3 (now Pier 54) in Seattle, circa 1910. The Kitsap County Transportation Company grew out of a business known as the Hansen Transportation Company. The founder of Hansen Transportation was Capt J.J. Hansen who moved to Tacoma from Minnesota in 1888. In Minnesota, and later in Boxton, North Dakota, J.J. Hansen had been in the business of selling farm equipment. J.J. Hansen had two sons who joined him in the steamboat business, Captains Henry A. Hansen and Ole L. Hansen (1875–1940), as well as a son-in-law, Capt. Alf Hostmark. The business was formally organized in 1898, but started earlier.Kline and Bayless, Ferryboats, at 107-108. Hansen Transportation initially acquired the steamer Quickstep and put it on the mail route between Port Madison and Poulsbo. Business proved good, and the business was able to acquire the Hattie Hansen, trading the Quickstep for machinery to build another steamboat, the Sentinel. The Hansens then become involved in a rate war with the Moe Brothers who were running the steamer Reliance on the Dogfish Bay route in against the Hansens' Sentinel.  Formation  The rate war was settled when Kitsap County businessman Warren I. \\"Colonel\\" Gazzam (b. 1863) bought Reliance. Gazzam also had some business allies acquire a major stake in the Hansen company. Gazzam arranged to have Reliance left on the Dogfish Bay route, while transferring Sentinel to a longer route, Harper – Colby – West Bainbridge Island – Brownsville. With Gazzam in charge as president, the company officially changed its name, in March 1905, to the Kitsap County Transportation Company. The company's official emblem as painted on the ships' smokestacks, was a white band (called a \\"collar\\") painted around the stack, with the letter \\"K\\" in black or red on each side. The company was capitalized at $200,000. Acquisitions The Kitsap County Transportation Company acquired a number of steamboats, including Kitsap, Hyak, Burton, Falcon, Vashon II, Tolo, and Kitsap II. In March 1905 KCTC bought Reliance for $20,000. In December 1906 the company purchased Burton for $11,225. In June, 1909 the company bought Hyak, paying $51,101.72. In April 1914 the company purchased Suquamish for $23,807.73. In November 1915, KCTC bought Camano from the Capt. H.B. Lovejoy's Island Transportation Company for $15,000 and renamed the vessel Tolo.Public Service Commission of Washington, Complainant, v. Kitsap County Transportation Company, Respondent, Case No. 4274, published in State of Washington, Public Service Commission, Annual Report (1916), at page 150 (accessed 06-04-11)] Suquamish, sometimes referred to at the time as \\"Hyak's pup\\" was notable for being the first diesel-powered passenger vessel in the United States.Kline and Bayless, Ferryboats – Legend on Puget Sound at pages 111, 113, and 115. Waterfront property As of January 1, 1917, the company owned of waterfront property at Brownsville, Washington, valued for rate-paying purposes at $6,600, and a dock at Suquamish, valued at $1,800. In 1927, Kitsap County Transportation Companyand Puget Sound Freight Lines (PSFL) formed a joint venture company called the Ferry Dock Company, which took out a long-term lease on the Grand Trunk Pacific dock in Seattle, which was then in a rundown condition. The dock became the main terminal and for both lines.Kline and Bayless, Ferryboats – A Legend on Puget Sound, at pages 181, 188, 196, and 200. In 1929, the stockholders of KCTC and PSFL reached agreement with Wilbur B.

Foshay however was financially ruined in the October 1929 stock market crash and the transaction never went through.

Early life  Raghavaiah was born in a Telugu-speaking family from the northern part of the Madras Presidency.

He is credited with having reformed the electoral system in Travancore. However, Raghavaiah's diwanship is remembered as a period of turbulence and discontent. In 1920, he raised the tuition fees for students in government colleges. This was followed by protests all over the state. Untouchables had been prohibited from entering the Vaikom temple since time immemorial. In the early 1920s, however, though the efforts of politician T. K.

It was written by José Rizal as a response to the accusation of Indio or Malay indolence. He admits the existence of indolence among the Filipinos, but it could be attributed to a number of reasons. He traces its causes to factors such as the climate and social disorders. He defends the Filipinos by saying that they are by nature not indolent, because in fact, even before the arrival of Spaniards, Filipinos have been engaged in economic activities such as agriculture and trade. Indolence therefore has more deeply rooted causes such as abuse and discrimination. A similar work was written by Syed Hussein Alatas, entitled The Myth of the Lazy Native.Syed Hussein Alatas (2010). The Myth of the Lazy Native: A Study of the Image of the Malays, Filipinos and Javanese from the 16th to the 20th Century and Its Function in the Ideology of Colonial Capitalism. Routledge. . Summary =Chapter 1= Rizal acknowledges the prior work of Gregorio Del Pilar and admits that indolence does exist among the Filipinos, but it cannot be attributed to the troubles and backwardness of the country; rather it is the effect of the backwardness and troubles experienced by the country. Past writings on indolence revolve only on either denying or affirming, and never studying its causes in depth. One must study the causes of indolence, Rizal says, before curing it. He therefore enumerates the causes of indolence and elaborates on the circumstances that have led to it. The hot climate, he points out, is a reasonable predisposition for indolence. Filipinos cannot be compared to Europeans, who live in cold countries and who must exert much more effort at work. An hour's work under the Philippine sun, he says, is equivalent to a day's work in temperate regions. =Chapter 2= Rizal says that an illness will worsen if the wrong treatment is given. The same applies to indolence. People, however, should not lose hope in fighting indolence. Even before the Spaniards arrived, Rizal argues, the early Filipinos were already carrying out trade within provinces and with other neighboring countries; they were also engaged in agriculture and mining; some natives even spoke Spanish. All this disproves the notion that Filipinos are by nature indolent. Rizal ends by asking what then would have caused Filipinos to forget their past. =Chapter 3= Rizal enumerates several reasons that may have caused the Filipinos' cultural and economic decadence. The frequent wars, insurrections, and invasions have brought disorder to the communities. Chaos has been widespread, and destruction rampant. Many Filipinos have also been sent abroad to fight wars for Spain or for expeditions. Thus, the population has decreased in number. Due to forced labor, many men have been sent to shipyards to construct vessels. Meanwhile, natives who have had enough of abuse have gone to the mountains. As a result, the farms have been neglected. The so-called indolence of Filipinos definitely has deeply rooted causes. =Chapter 4= According to Rizal, Filipinos are not responsible for their misfortunes, as they are not their own masters. The Spanish government has not encouraged labor and trade, which ceased after the government treated the country's neighboring trade partners with great suspicion. Trade has declined, furthermore, because of pirate attacks and the many restrictions imposed by the government, which gives no aid for crops and farmers. This and the abuse suffered under encomenderos have caused many to abandon the fields. Businesses are monopolized by many government officials, red tape and bribery operate on a wide scale, rampant gambling is tolerated by the government. This situation is compounded by the Church's wrong doctrine which holds that the rich will not go to heaven, thus engendering a wrong attitude toward work. There has also been discrimination in education against natives. These are some of the main reasons that Rizal cites as causing the deterioration of values among the Filipinos. =Chapter 5= According to Rizal, all the causes of indolence can be reduced to two factors. The first factor is the limited training and education Filipino natives receive. Segregated from Spaniards, Filipinos do not receive the same opportunities that are available to the foreigners. They are taught to be inferior. The second factor is the lack of a national sentiment of unity among them. Because Filipinos think they are inferior, they submit to the foreign culture and do everything to imitate it. The solution, according to Rizal, would be education and liberty.

In terms of production, the film was for many years the last extant Oswald cartoon directed by Walt Disney; until late 2015, when Sleigh Bells, the Oswald cartoon made after Tall Timber, was rediscovered. Plot summary Oswald is canoeing down a rough river. Upon reaching his destination, which is the lake, Oswald brings out his rifle and decides to go duck hunting. The ducks, however, are quite clever, and Oswald ends up shooting a hole in his boat, thus sinking it. He was unintendedly brought to dry ground by a moose. While walking downhill, Oswald is chased by a boulder. His efforts to outrun the large rock are in vain as it rams him flat against a tree. In an attempt to restore his normal shape, Oswald drops a smaller rock on top of himself. This results in him having a more spherical physique, making it difficult for him to walk. As he goes walking, Oswald stumbled and starts tumbling on the ground. In his path, two bear cubs are drinking syrup from maple trees. Oswald runs into one of them, causing that bear to be thrown upward. The cub's fall is cushioned when Oswald rolled back. Amazed by Oswald's bloated shape and bouncy qualities, the bears use him as a trampoline. Not willing to share with each other, the bears pull Oswald from opposite sides, stretching him back to his original form. Annoyed by their antics, Oswald chases one of the bears to what looks like a tree stump. The stump turns out to be the mother of the two bears who then chases Oswald into a cave. Upon entering the cave, Oswald and the big bear go into a tussle. Ironically, the big bear comes out with no fur on her torso and runs in embarrassment.

His most famous works include Křemílek and Vochomůrka, Rumcajs, Manka and Cipísek, and Víla Amálka. He primarily wrote fairy tales for children, and some of his works have been adapted on the Czech children's television program Večerníček. On 4 April 2011, Google celebrated his 100th birthday by replacing the original Google logo with a doodle celebrating his works for a day on Google Czech Republic.  Biography  Čtvrtek was born in Prague, however, he spent a part of his childhood in Jičín, the town which later became the setting for his stories and fairy tales. He studied at gymnasium (graduated in 1931) and continued his studies at the Faculty of Law of the Charles University in Prague.Menclová (2005), p. 129 Initially, he worked as a clerk, and only after the World War II he began contributing to the children's magazines, such as Mateřídouška and Ohníček. In 1949, he was engaged as a dramaturgist in the Czechoslovak Radio, where he participated in broadcasting for children and youth. From the late 1950s, he created scripts for cartoons produced by the Czechoslovak Television. In collaboration with illustrator Radek Pilař and voice actors Karel Höger, Vlastimil Brodský, Jiřina Bohdalová and Jiří Hrzán he created some of the most popular cycles of the television programme Večerníček.

Filipinas dentro de cien anos () is a socio-political essay written in four parts (1889-1890) in the magazine La solidaridad by José Rizal. It is one of the most significant political works of the movement in Spain, Rizal tracing the circumstances that brought about the awakening of the Filipino and consequently the birth of the Filipino spirit of a nation. He underscores the need to establish a new kind of political relationship between Spain and the Philippines if the former does not wish a total break-up with the latter. Spain is being given a sort of ultimatum: reform or independence. But more than a warning, the article is a sensible request of an affectionate son who sincerely wishes to avoid a bloody separation between Spain and the Philippines. He ends his article with a prediction on the possible political intervention of European or neighboring powers or even that of the United States of America should the Philippines declare itself independent from Spain. He dismisses that possibility, given the existence of other more enticing economic prospects.

The native name is Nuumte Oote 'True Voice'. A vibrant, albeit minority, language until the middle of the 20th century, the language suffered after the introduction of compulsory education in Spanish, urbanisation, and migration of its speakers. Nowadays there are approximately 15 speakers whose ages range from 67 to 90. In 2010 a story started circulating that the last two speakers of the Ayapaneco language were enemies and no longer talked to each other. The story was incorrect, and while it was quickly corrected it came to circulate widely. Daniel Suslak, an Assistant Professor of Anthropology at Indiana University, is one of the linguists working to prepare the first dictionary of the language. Since 2012, the Instituto Nacional de Lenguas Indígenas (INALI) (also known as the National Indigenous Languages Institute) has been supporting the Ayapa community's efforts at revitalising their language. In 2013 Vodafone launched an advertisement campaign in which they claimed to have helped the community revitalize the language, proposing an erroneous story of enmity between Don Manuel and Don Isidro. The commercial appeared on YouTube. According to Suslak and other observers the actual help provided to Ayapan and the Ayapaneco language by Vodafone was extremely limited and did not address the actual necessities of the community.

Background Tchernavin was born in 1887 in Tsarskoye Selo, near St. Petersburg, Russian Empire, into a noble family of modest means. After his father died in 1902 he took part as a collector-zoologist in expeditions to the Altai region with the Russian explorer Vasili Sapozhnikov. Later he became the leader in a series of scientific expeditions to the Altai Mountain and Sayanskii Mountain, Mongolia, the Tian Shan Mountains, the Amur River region, and the Ussuriysk region on the Siberian-Manchurian border and to Lapland. In the period from 1912-1917 Tchernavin studied at St. Petersburg University but his studies were interrupted by the war. He was conscripted and served in the army, but was wounded and invalided out in 1915. He resumed his studies at the renamed Petrograd University, and graduated in 1916. Career Food shortages were very severe in Russian cities at this time, and Tchernavin took a lecturing post at the Petrograd Agronomical Institute in order to obtain the daily issue of milk from the Institute's herd to members of staff, for the baby. Here he completed a thesis and obtained an advanced degree. From 1923, he was Professor of Ichthyology at the Institute, and from 1926 he moved to Murmansk as Director of Production and Research Work of the Northern Fisheries Trust, the State-owned industry which had been set up to deal with the fishing sector in the region along the Arctic Ocean. He gave up the management of production in 1928, in order to concentrate on research work. His main academic research to this point had been study of skeletal development and re-development in salmon species, and its application to systematics and evolution: these publications were not available outside the USSR in his lifetime. His family remained in Leningrad (Saint-Petersburg), where Tatiana worked as curator in the Section of Applied Arts of the Hermitage. In 1930 some of his colleagues were arrested by the Soviet secret police, the Gosudarstvennoye Politicheskoye Upravlenie (State Political Directorate) or \\"GPU.\\" He was also questioned by GPU officers. While on a visit to Moscow, 48 leading figures and intellectuals in charge of Russia's state food industry were convicted in show trials and executed for 'wrecking' activities. A number of the executed persons were personal friends and colleagues of Tchernavin. =Arrest and conviction= He then decided not to return to Murmansk but to join his family in Leningrad. Here he was arrested at his home and his apartment was searched. He was imprisoned in the Shpalernaya prison in Leningrad. He was interrogated and threatened with execution should he refuse to confess. To put more pressure on him, the GPU also arrested his wife in January 1931. He refused to confess in the knowledge that a confession would mean certain death. He was later moved to the Kresty prison. On 25 April 1931, Tchernavin was convicted for \\"wrecking\\" under Article 58, Paragraph 7 of the Soviet Penal Code and was sentenced to 5 years of Gulag labor camps. He was able to have a brief meeting with his son before his transport to the camps. =Gulag life= He was put on a prison transport to the Solovetsky labor camp on 2 May 1931. Initially sharing with other inmates hard labour such as loading logs he was subsequently translated to the camp of Kem where he worked as an ichthyologist in the Fishery Department of the camp. Here he started making preparations for his escape. He learned that his wife had been released from prison. He was able to arrange that as part of his prison work he could travel extensively throughout Kem district without an escort with the purpose of setting up new fishing points and study the possibility of using fish for animal feed. He used these travels to make further preparations for his family's escape. He had a first meeting with his wife and son in November 1931. For a while he was \\"rented\\" by the prison authorities as a lecturer and trained managers of collective fish farms. The better treatment that he received during this period allowed him to remain fit for his planned escape. =Escape= In August 1932, his wife and son visited him again and they then set out on their epic escape. After 22 days of trekking through rugged terrain and suffering hardships due to a lack of provisions and poor weather, they were finally able to reach Finland. (Tchernavin's son gave an account of the escape, filmed on location in the Russian arctic, in Angus MacQueen's documentary Gulag (2000). ) Life after the Gulag Tchernavin's wife Tatiana began to write her account of their escape during a period she spent in hospital recovering from the adverse effects of the journey on a heart condition. The book was published first in London in October 1933. The Tchernavins were still living in Finland in 1933, but in April of that year, a letter from Vladimir, entitled \\"Methods of the OGPU\\" was published in The London Times. The letter was a rebuttal from his personal experience of the statement by Andrey Vyshinsky at the then current trial in Moscow of Metropolitan-Vickers engineers that '...in U.S.S.R. the accused are not put to torture...'. A subsequent letter from Sir Bernard Pares strongly suggests that Pares had helped to bring about Vladimir's publication, and in March 1934 Pares presided at Tatiana's public lecture in London, entitled \\"The fate of the intellectual worker in Soviet Russia\\". In 1934 Tchernavin and his family moved to England, where he continued his scientific work as an ichthyologist. He worked in the Natural History Museum in London until his death. (Tatiana became a translator in the UK Ministry of Information for the remainder of World War II and helped subtitle Noël Coward's war propaganda film In Which We Serve. Andrei became a civil engineer and designed the Bow Flyover.) Personal life and death Tchernavin married Tatiana Vasilievna Sapozhnikova (1887–1971), an arts graduate from the same university. They had one child, a son Andrei (Andrei Vladimirovich Tchernavin, 1918–2007). Tchernavin died in 1949 in England. Tchernavin, his wife, and son are all interred at the St. Mary Churchyard in South Perrott, West Dorset District, Dorset, England. Legacy Tchernavin's I Speak for the Silent: Prisoners of the Soviets (1935) and his wife's book Escape From The Soviets (1934) were among the first to give testimony of life under the Soviets, the GPU's operations and the Gulag. The New Masses (a literary, communist magazine in New York City) decried Tchernavin's I Speak for the Silent as a \\"vicious\\" attack on the Soviet Union by a member of the \\"nobility.\\" The review stated: > Tchernavin poses as the intellectual who is above political intrigue and is > anxious to do his job, but prevented by persecution as a class enemy... > Under the guise of a \\"scientific analysis\\" he points out that the control > figures \\"dictated\\" by the Central Planning Buro were impossible and absurd, > because of the shortage of labor, skilled and unskilled, the physical > handicaps, and inefficiency of party members... The rest of the book deals > with Tchernavin's prison experiences and his attempts to escape. Here the > scientist's mask is dropped and we enter the dime novel world... Tchernavin > makes a show of scientific objectivity but essentially his is the story of a > man who through class drawbacks was a misfit in a new society.

Eric Sahlström (1912-1986 CE) was a Swedish player of the nyckelharpa, and riksspelman awardee from Tobo in northern Uppland, Sweden. Sahlström won great respect for his musicianship in an era when folk music was not yet an established art form. He was hired by Bo Nilson in 1962 to play in a new work at the Venice Biennale. In 1968 he received the Swedish Local Heritage Federation's medal from Gustaf VI Adolf and the same year the Royal Swedish Academy of Music's Medaljen för tonkonstens främjande (\\"Medal for Music Promotion\\"). He was nominated as a music professor at the Royal College of Music, Stockholm. In 1976 he was recognised for \\"artistic quality and importance for Swedish culture\\", as the first musician to receive that award. Eric Sahlström is one of those who most contributed most to the renaissance of the nyckelharpa (\\"key fiddle\\") in modern times. The instrument at that point had some small popularity amongst a handful of musicians in Uppland, but Sahlström as a design engineer and luthier further developed the instrument, including refining the chromatic nyckelharpa which can play any key. He also composed a large number of folk songs. Among the most famous include the waltz Spelmansglädje (\\"Fiddler Joy\\") and the polskas Stormyren and Hardrevet. A bronze statue of Sahlström made by Ingvar Jörpeland in 1992 was installed by the church of Tegelsmora his burial-ground. The Eric Sahlström Institute in Tobo is named after Sahlström.

This lets web pages avoid unsupported features by informing the user their browser isn't supported or loading a polyfill. Modernizr aims to provide feature detection in a consistent and easy to use manner that discourages the use of failure-prone browser sniffing. Overview Many HTML5 and CSS 3 features are already implemented in at least one major browser. Modernizr determines whether the user's browser has implemented a given feature. This lets developers take advantage of new features that browsers support, yet create fallbacks for browsers that lack support. In both 2010 and 2011, Modernizr won the .net Award for Open Source App of the Year, and in 2011 one of its lead developers, Paul Irish, won the Developer of the Year award..net Awards 2011:#7. Open Source App of the Year: Modernizr 2.0, #16. Developer of the Year: Paul Irish Function Modernizr uses feature detection, rather than checking the browser's property, to discern what a browser can and cannot do. It considers feature detection more reliable since the same rendering engine may not necessarily support the same things in two different browsers using that engine. In addition, some users change their user agent string to get around websites that block features for browsers with specific user agent settings, despite their browsers having the necessary capabilities. Modernizr offers tests for more than 250 features, then creates a JavaScript object (named \\"Modernizr\\") that contains the results of these tests as boolean properties. It also adds classes to the HTML element based on what features are and are not natively supported. To perform feature detection tests, Modernizr often creates an element, sets a specific style instruction on that element and then immediately tries to retrieve that setting. Web browsers that understand the instruction will return something sensible; browsers that don't understand it will return nothing or \\"undefined\\". Modernizr uses the result to assess whether that feature is supported by the web browser. Many tests in the documentation come with a small code sample to illustrate how a specific test can be used in web development workflow. Running When it runs, it creates a global object called Modernizr that contains a set of Boolean properties for each feature it can detect. For example, if a browser supports the canvas API, the Modernizr.canvas property will be true. If the browser does not support the canvas API, the Modernizr.canvas property will be false: if (Modernizr.canvas) { // Let's draw some shapes...! } else { // No native canvas support available :( } Limitations The library is simply a feature-detection method and as such, does not add missing functionality to older browsers.

Organocerium chemistry is the corresponding science exploring properties, structure and reactivity of these compounds. In general, organocerium compounds are not isolable, and are rather studied in solution via their reactions with other species. There are notable exceptions, such as the Cp*3Ce(III) complex shown at right, but they are relatively rare. Complexes involving cerium of various oxidation states are known: though lanthanides are most stable in the +3 state, complexes of cerium(IV) have been reported. These latter compounds have found less widespread use due to their oxidizing nature, and the majority of literature regarding organometallic cerium complexes involves the +3 oxidation state. In particular, organocerium compounds have been developed extensively as non-basic carbon nucleophiles in organic synthesis. Because cerium is relatively non-toxic, they serve as an \\"environmentally friendly\\" alternative to other organometallic reagents. Several reviews detailing these applications have been published. Structure The solution structure of organocerium reagents remains unclear, although there is agreement that it depends heavily on the manner in which it is prepared. In particular, those derived from organolithium reagents likely are believed to form something similar to a 'true' organocerium structure, \\"R-CeCl2,\\" while those derived from Grignard reagents are more appropriately characterized as -ate complexes of the form \\"R-MgX•CeCl3\\". Furthermore, the solvent seems to alter the solution structure of the complex, with differences noted between reagents prepared in diethyl ether and tetrahydrofuran. There is evidence that the parent chloride forms a polymeric species in THF solution, of the form [Ce(μ-Cl)2(H2O)(THF)2]n, but whether this type of polymer exists once the organometallic reagent is formed is unknown. Preparation Organocerium compounds are typically prepared via transmetallation from the respective organolithium or Grignard reagent. The most common cerium source for this purpose is cerium (III) chloride, which can be obtained in anhydrous form via dehydration of the commercially available heptahydrate. Precomplexation with tetrahydrofuran is important for the success of the transmetallation, with most procedures involving \\"vigorous stirring for a period of no less than 2 hours\\". Reagents derived from alkyl, alkynyl, and alkenyl organometallic reagents as well as cerium enolates have been described. The stability of each is approximately the same regardless of origin (i.e. lithiate or Grignard), with the exception of alkenyl reagents, which tend to be more stable when derived from the corresponding lithiate. The reasons for this are still poorly understood. Functional groups compatible with the parent organometallic compound are generally also stable upon transmetallation to cerium. The figure below summarizes the kinds of organocerium compounds that have been prepared. Examples of various organocerium reagents previously reported. Reactions Organocerium reagents are used almost exclusively for addition reactions in the same vein as organolithium and Grignard reagents. To this end, they have a number of particularly useful characteristics that distinguish them from their more common counterparts. They are incredibly nucleophilic, allowing additions to imines in the absence of additional Lewis acid catalysts, making them useful for substrates in which typical conditions fail. Nucleophilicity of organocerium reagents Despite this high reactivity, organocerium reagents are almost entirely non-basic, tolerating the presence of free alcohols and amines as well as enolizable α-protons. Non-basic tendencies in organocerium reagents The oxophilicity of cerium imparts strong 1,2-selectivity in reactions with conjugated electrophiles similarly to organolithium reagents. At the same time, organocerium reagents can be used to synthesize ketones from acyl compounds without over-addition, as seen with organocuprates.

Organization The National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians (NASHIP) or \\"Kassenärztliche Bundesvereinigung (KBV)\\", based in Berlin, is the co-ordinating body of all 17 State Associations of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians in Germany. As of 2018, it represented about 175,000 office-based physicians' and psychotherapists. NASHIP is a body under public law and part of the medical self-government in Germany. It consists of a governing board of 3 directors, elected for a 6 year term by a delegates’ meeting of 60 representatives of the regional ASHIPs. As of 2020, the chairman is Andreas Gassen, in charge of care provided by medical specialists, vice Chairman Stephan Hofmeister, responsible for services provided by general practitioners and Thomas Kriedel, expert in the digitalization of public healthcare and economics. NASHIP has about 370 employees. Activities The organization lobbies for office-based physicians (physicians in private practice) and physiotherapists in legislative processes: As a member of the Federal Joint Committee it is one of the organizations, which determines the benefit catalogue. NASHIP makes contracts with the national confederations of the health insurance funds and other parties of the health care sector devising and revising physician fee schedule, the so-called \\"Uniform Assessment Standard\\". and thus physician salaries. As of 2016, these vary enormously. NAHIP does not publish its budget or annual reports, and has been criticized for its non-transparency. History NASHIP´s precursor was the \\"Kassenärztliche Vereinigung Deutschlands\\" (Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians), founded in 1931 to settle disputes between physicians and health insurance funds. As early as 1935, all managing directors of the Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians were summoned for ideological training in a \\"School for leadership for the German medical profession\\" (Führerschule der deutschen Ärzteschaft) in Alt Rehse, initially under the direction of Hans Deuschl. After 1936, the school belonged to the Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians; between 1935 and 1941 an estimated 10,000 to 12,000 physicians were indoctrinated in courses there, lasting from 7–10 days. As of 2018, NASHIPs role in the Third Reich was still to be investigated. An interim report of academic study by the Center of Antisemitic Studies at the TU Berlin was expected to be published in December 2019. Criticism In 2012, a rare glimpse on NASHIPs inappropriate financial transactions showed, that it had offered a credit of 56 million Eiuro to its own real estate company. In 2012, then Director Andreas Köhler made headlines with a salary of 350,000 Euro, and retiring in 2014 with 270,000 Euro. As of 2015, infighting, intrigues and power struggles caused such dysfunction, that a law was enacted to allow closing doctors offices in areas of high physician density (\\"überversorgte Gebiete\\") and allowing physicians to open a new office in medically underserved areas. In 2016, governmental oversight ordered NASHIP to reverse inappropriate pension payments to leading figures.

The species is solely known from copal found on the beach near Sambava, on the northeast coast of Madagascar. History and classification Garcorops jadis is known only from one fossil, the holotype. The single, adult male individual is preserved in a clear Hymenaea verrucosa copal specimen. The copal measures with several dipterans, a cockroach, a mite and a juvenile araneid spider also included within. The copal is currently housed in the Royal Museum for Central Africa in Tervuren, Belgium. G. jadis was first studied by Jan Bosselaers, with his March 2004 type description being published in the journal Zootaxa. The specific name was coined by Jan Bosselaers as a reference to Jadis, the White Witch from the 1950 children's fantasy novel The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe by C. S. Lewis in reference to the beautiful quality of preservation in the holotype specimen, which seems \\"enclosed in ice, frozen in time forever\\". In September 2004 paleoarachnologist Jörg Wunderlich published the description of ?Anyphops cortex, for which he was uncertain of the generic placement. After reviewing the type specimens of both ?Anyphops cortex and Garcorops jadis, David Penney, Hirotsugu Ono & Paul A. Selden determined the two specimens were from the same species belonging to Garcorops. As a result of the name Garcorops jadis being published first, ?Anyphops cortex was declared a junior synonym. Description Garcorops jadis is with a carapace that is . The carapace is a yellow-brown in color with some darker marking still visible and a coating of white hairs while the abdomen is also yellow-brown with some darker markings and pale pointed hairs. The legs are a similar in coloration to the body and show faint dark banded markings. The overall structure and positioning of the eyes indicates placement into the genus Garcorops. Of the extant species of Garcorops, G. jadis is most similar to the endemic G. madagascar. Both species have a well developed cymbial dorsal scopula with long embolus circling the bulbus. However the retrolateral tibial apophysis on the pedipalps of Garcorops jadis is more pointed then that of G. madagascar. Due to the preservation of the holotype and only known specimen in copal, it is uncertain as to the age and status of the species. It is possible that Garcorops jadis is an extant species which has not been recovered as live specimens. It is also possible, however, that the species is already extinct.

On her trial trip, Clara Claritas original engine proved so ineffective it was removed before the vessel entered service and replaced by machinery from a different supplier. Jerome sold the yacht after only a short time and she was converted into a towboat, becoming the fastest such vessel in New York Harbor, before being converted into a fireboat in the same locality. In the 1870s, Clara Clarita underwent a third conversion, into a passenger steamer, in which role she set an all-time speed record for a steamer on Penobscot Bay. Her final conversion was into an oceangoing tug, some time after which her crew and captain were presented with a heroism award for a rescue at sea. The vessel was abandoned in 1908 after a long and varied 44-year career. Construction and design Clara Clarita was built for Leonard Jerome in 1864 at Williamsburg, New York by Lawrence & Foulks,\\"Mr. Jerome's Yacht\\", Scientific American, New Series, Volume 11, Issue 7, p. 106, 13 August 1864. a company with a reputation for building fast and elegant steamers.Morrison 1909, p. 163. Her construction was supervised throughout by W. W. Vanderbilt, Chief Engineer of the Pacific Mail Steamship Company. The vessel was named after Leonard Jerome's wife Clara and/or his daughter Clarita, also known as Clara. Clara Claritas frames and outer planking were of white oak, the latter inches thick. The cabin hatches and combings above deck were mahogany, \\"plainly but beautifully finished\\". The vessel was in length along the keel, and on deck, with a beam of and hold depth of . She had a high bow, two raking masts, schooner-rigged, and a single raked smokestack. For protection, she was armed with two steel 12-pounder (5.4 kg) Wiard boat howitzers with brass carriages. Overall, she was described as a vessel \\"of an exquisite model, every graceful line proclaiming her speed.\\"Day, p. 92. =Interior= Clara Claritas interior was designed by one of America's leading shipjoiners, William Rowland,\\"The Clara Clarita Controversy\\", The New York Times, 10 February 1864. the \\"Lorenzo Ghiberti\\" of his trade.Swann, p. 56. Below deck, the steamer contained sleeping berths, two cabins, one forward and one aft, a pantry and \\"a dainty little wash-room aft\\". The panelwork in the after cabin was white with \\"faint pink tints\\" and gold highlights, while the forward cabin was \\"handsomely furnished\\". The berths were fringed with green silk curtains lined with canary-yellow satin, and a black walnut beaufet held the silverware. In her memoirs, Jerome's daughter Jennie (later Lady Randolph Churchill and the mother of Sir Winston Churchill) recalled the \\"dismay\\" on her mother's face when she first saw the ship's extravagant velvet and silver fittings, installed as a result of the free rein extended by Jerome to the upholsterer.Churchill, p. 43. Total cost of the vessel was $125,000 (). =Original engine controversy= While Clara Clarita was under construction, Jerome was persuaded by a number of acquaintances to avail himself of the services of E. N. Dickerson, a prominent patent lawyer with some novel engineering ideas. Impressed by Dickerson's claim that he could adapt an ordinary land engine to power Clara Clarita, saving both space and weight at no cost in performance, Jerome decided to hire him.\\"Mr. E. N. Dickerson and the Steam Yacht Clara Clarita: Note From the Owner of the Yacht\\", The New York Times, 6 February 1864. Contemporary cartoon published anonymously by a U.S. Navy officer, mocking Dickerson's engineering skills For the adaptation, Dickerson purchased a $5,000, stationary horizontal engine, with a cylinder and stroke, built by the Fishkill Landing Machine Works.\\"Local Intelligence: The Metropolitan Fair\\", The New York Times, 26 April 1864. Dickerson took eight months to adapt the engine to the yacht, at an overall cost of $16,178.08. On Clara Claritas trial trip, Dickerson's engine adaptation proved a complete failure. After Dickerson failed to return to rectify the problems, Jerome hired two qualified engineers, who, after another trial, agreed that the machinery was unfit for service. Because Dickerson was also known for his vocal criticism of the Chief of the US Navy's Bureau of Steam Engineering, Benjamin Isherwood, whose warship engine designs for the ongoing Civil War Dickerson claimed were slow and inefficient,\\"Mr. Dickerson and Engineering: Note from Mr. E. N. Dickerson\\", The New York Times, 13 February 1864.Bennett, pp. 517-526. the failure of Clara Claritas engine soon came to public attention. After Dickerson was perceived to be attempting to shift the blame to others for the failure of his engine adaptation in a letter to The New York Times, his claims were rebuffed in the pages of the Times by several parties, including Jerome himself. Jerome described Clara Claritas initial trial trip in the following terms: > We started from the Continental Works down the river. The day was fine, > everything was in order, the model of the boat was pronounced perfection, > and we started off with flying colors. Her machinery alone remained to be > tried. To the best of my recollection we made one mile and a quarter in just > two hours and a half. It was ... a brief if not a pleasant trip, to all on > board—including myself--especially considering that I had waited eight > months for the adaptation of this machinery. I could have had fifty engines > built during this time notwithstanding the \\"Government pressure\\". We should > have proceeded further down the river, but at Corlear's Hook we were driven > back--by the tide. Jerome's account, including his cited average speed of only , was corroborated by two further letters to the Times, from E. Riggs and Clara Claritas commander, Captain Alex Smith. In his response, also published in the Times, Dickerson did not deny the abysmal performance of his engine adaptation, confining his comments instead to a denial of the charge that he had lied in his previous letter. The spectacular failure of the engine was not lost on Dickerson's enemies in the Navy Department, some of whom quickly published a satirical piece on him entitled Uncle Samuel's Whistle And What It Costs.Weir. The piece was later reproduced in Frank M. Bennett's book The Steam Navy of the United States.Bennett, pp. 919–948. =Re-engine= After the failure of Dickerson's engine, Jerome went to a leading marine engineering firm, the Novelty Iron Works of New York, for a replacement. The Novelty Works supplied a pair of single-cylinder, inverted direct-acting engines with bore and stroke, designed by J. V. Holmes and built under the supervision of W. W. Vanderbilt. The engines, described as \\"beautiful specimens of workmanship\\", were made more compact by the use of the engines' frame as the surface condenser, while the air-pump gearing was arranged to balance the moving parts. The engines operated a single four-bladed iron screw propeller, with a diameter of and pitch of . In a new trial trip on 28 July 1864, the engines attained a rate of 96 rpm, equivalent to about , while maintaining a \\"remarkably smooth and regular\\" action. It was noted however that the engines could be expected to \\"run much faster\\" in future. Service history Steam yacht Clara Clarita in 1864, as originally designed =Jerome ownership, 1864-65= In July 1865, about a year after Jerome took possession of Clara Clarita, a public clamour arose for the repair of the Gulf of St. Lawrence submarine telegraph cable, linking Newfoundland with the North American mainland, in time for the arrival of a new telegraph cable then being laid between Great Britain and Newfoundland by the steamship . Jerome decided to make Clara Clarita available for the task.\\"Mr. Leonard W. Jerome and His Yacht Clara Clarita\\", The New York Times, 20 July 1865. Accordingly, Clara Clarita departed New York with two cable experts and their assistants on 23 July,\\"Naval Items\\", The New York Times, 24 July 1865. arriving at Halifax, Nova Scotia, on the 28th, having shown herself on the voyage to be \\"an excellent sea-boat\\".\\"Arrival of the Clara Clarita at Halifax\\", The New York Times, 29 July 1865.\\"The Clara Clarita\\", The New York Times, 25 July 1865. At Halifax, some brief preparations were made before the vessel continued on to Aspy Bay on Cape Breton Island, where the cable retrieval operation began.\\"Local and Other Matters\\", Morning Chronicle, p. 2, 29 July 1865. Clara Claritas return was awaited with great anticipation, but when she finally arrived in the port of North Sydney, Nova Scotia on 11 August, it was with the disappointing news that the cable was damaged beyond repair.\\"The St. Lawrence Cable Gone\\", The New York Times, 12 August 1865. Clara Clarita returned to New York a few days later via Newport, Rhode Island.\\"The Yacht Clara Clarita at Newport\\", The New York Times, 17 August 1865. Jerome's enthusiasm for yachting is said to have been considerably dampened by his experiences with Clara Clarita.Clews, p. 669. In early November, after owning the vessel for only some 20 months, he sold her to the Pacific Mail Steamship Company for use as a towboat.\\"Sale of the Yacht Clara Clarita\\", The New York Times, 11 November 1865. =New York towboat and fireboat, 1865-early 1870s= Clara Clarita was converted into a towboat at Novelty Iron Works, after which, Pacific Mail employed her to tow its Atlantic Line vessels in and out of dock. In her new role, Clara Clarita soon established a reputation for herself as the fastest towboat in New York Harbor. In May 1870, the vessel was listed as a $30,000 asset in a Pacific Mail report.Dana, p. 65. Clara Clarita came into the possession of the New York Harbor Protective Company in 1870, when she was converted into a fireboat.\\"United States District Court--In Admiralty\\" (pdf), The New York Times, 25 October 1871. In August 1870, Clara Clarita was towing a burning ferryboat out of harm's way when the tow rope burned through, allowing the ferry to collide with a schooner and set it on fire. In a later landmark ruling, the courts ruled that although the damage was caused by the ferry not the tug, and regardless of whether or not the schooner was anchored improperly, the tug was still at fault through negligently using a rope rather than a chain to tow the ferry.Canfield, p. 166.Farwell, pp. 233-235. =Passenger steamer, 1870s= By 1873, Clara Clarita had undergone another conversion, to a passenger steamboat, although she retained the heavy brass fire monitors from her fireboat days. At this time, she was acquired by the Fox Island and Rockland Steamboat Company of Maine as competition for a rival steamer Ulysses, which had proven faster than the company's existing steamer Pioneer on the Vinalhaven to Rockland route. Clara Clarita quickly drove the challenger away with her superior speed, and as long as she remained on the route, was a popular vessel among passengers. Her owners, however, considered her a \\"coal hog\\" and soon replaced her with a more economical vessel. In this period of her career, Clara Clarita recorded the fastest ever time by a steamer across Penobscot Bay.Richardson, pp. 73-75. =Maine tugboat, 1880s-1897= By the mid-1880s, Clara Clarita had passed into the hands of the Knickerbocker Steam Towage Company and been converted into an oceangoing tug. Along with Ice King, Clara Clarita was one of the company's largest tugs.\\"Bath Locals\\", Lewiston Evening Journal, p. 2, 20 July 1885. On 22 August 1887, the steamboat City of Richmond struck a rock near the entrance to Millbridge and was immediately beached to prevent her sinking.\\"A Steamer is Beached\\" (pdf), The New York Times, 23 August 1887. Clara Clarita was dispatched with wrecking pumps from her homeport of Bath, Maine the same day to help refloat the vessel.\\"Maine Town News - Bath\\", Lewiston Evening Journal, p. 3, 23 August 1887. City of Richmond was successfully hauled off the following day and towed to Mitchell's cove, where the damage was assessed as less than at first thought.\\"Other Items\\", Lewiston Evening Journal, p. 1, 23 August 1887. =Massachusetts tugboat, 1897-1908= Probably about 1897, Clara Clarita was sold to the Boston Towing Company,Hewitt, Rich: \\"Church's columns quarried on Vinalhaven\\", Bangor Daily News, pp. A1-A2, 19 December 2001. after which she was homeported briefly at Gloucester, Massachusetts and finally at Boston.See relevant editions of Merchant vessels of the United States and Annual List of Merchant Vessels of the United States for confirmation. Spanish–American War Following the outbreak of the Spanish–American War in April 1898, Clara Clarita was assigned to tow the ageing Civil War-era monitor to a defensive station at Boston. On 3 May, Lehigh was towed to shelter in Vineyard Haven by Clara Clarita due to threatening weather in Vineyard Sound.\\"The Lehigh Compelled to Harbor\\", Lewiston Evening Journal, p. 7, 3 May 1898. The two vessels set off for Boston once more the following day, but Clara Clarita blew a boiler tube and was obliged to return to port.\\"In Newport Harbor\\", Manufacturers and Farmers Journal, p. 3, 5 May 1898. According to one report, Lehigh continued on without the tug's assistance,\\"Monitor Lehigh Steaming Alone\\", The Philadelphia Record, p. 2, 5 May 1898. while another states that both Clara Clarita and Lehigh returned to port for a quick repair to Clara Claritas boiler tube, which was expected to be completed in a few hours. Various duties In June 1898, Clara Clarita was used to tow \\"a string of eighteen new knock about yachts\\" from Marblehead, Massachusetts to New York.\\"Salt Water Notes\\", The Day, p. 13, 8 June 1898. In August, Clara Clarita towed two specially-outfitted, chemically refrigerated barges, Fillid and J. K. Manning, to Burgeo, Newfoundland, for the purpose of loading herring and squid bait for American fishing bankers. The Newfoundland authorities however prohibited the transaction on the grounds that it would \\"completely revolutionize the purchase of bait\\" from Newfoundland by Americans. This decision cost the companies involved an estimated $50,000, who were described as \\"very foolish\\" for not seeking the approval of the local authorities beforehand.\\"Our Vessels Refused Bait\\" (pdf), The New York Times, 1 September 1898. The following year, in November, Clara Clarita departed Boston with steam pumps and a lighter bound for Swan's Island, Maine, to salvage the coal cargo of the ship Pottsville which had sunk there.\\"Will Discharge Coal\\", The Lewiston Daily Sun, 15 November 1899. Rescue at sea In December 1902, while towing an oil barge from Rockland to Saint John, New Brunswick, the Standard Oil tug Astral was wrecked on Mount Desert Rock, Maine. The revenue cutter managed to tow the barge and its crew to port on the night of 12 December, but due to heavy seas was unable to effect a rescue of Astrals crew, and was forced to return to Portland to re-coal. Clara Clarita, which had been in the vicinity preparing to salvage a sunken schooner, was called upon to stand by while Woodbury was absent.\\"Rockland\\" (pdf), The New York Times, 14 December 1902.\\"Capt. Sorensen Again Honored\\", Boston Evening Transcript, p. 2, 13 January 1903. On the 15th, Clara Claritas crew effected the rescue themselves, braving the hazardous conditions by twice sending one of the tug's boats to retrieve Astrals crew from the Rock. The following January, Clara Claritas captain, Alfred Sorensen, and two of his crew received heroism awards for the Astral rescue from the Massachusetts Humane Society. Since Sorensen had already received the Society's gold medal for an earlier rescue, he received a gold clasp, while the other two crew members received a bronze medal and $5 each.\\"Bravery Rewarded\\", The Lewiston Daily Sun, p. 1, 13 January 1903. Cathedral columns In March 1899, the Bodwell Granite Company of Vinalhaven, Maine was contracted to supply eight massive granite columns for New York's Cathedral of St. John the Divine, then under construction. By 1903, the first of the columns was ready. A specially constructed barge, Benjamin Franklin, was built to transport the columns, two at a time, from Vinalhaven to New York. Clara Clarita was assigned the duty of towing the barge.\\"Vinalhaven granite work to be featured in exhibition\\", Bangor Daily News, p. 33, 2 March 1999. The first transport mission went smoothly enough, with Clara Clarita delivering the first two 130-ton columns after an eight-day voyage to the 134th Street Pier, Hudson River, New York, on 10 July 1903. During a later shipment in November, Clara Clarita ran into a gale off Cape Cod and the barge carrying the columns was almost sunk, forcing both vessels to put into Newport to await an improvement in the weather.\\"Big Pillar Nearly Lost\\" (pdf), The New York Times, 1 December 1903. After the delivery of all eight columns, it took more than a year to install them at the Cathedral site and begin work on the walls. After a long and varied career spanning some 44 years, Clara Clarita was abandoned by her owners in 1908.\\"Will gives lithograph\\", Bangor Daily News, p. 20, 20 April 1982. Note that a couple of details in this article are incorrect, namely the claims that the vessel was homeported in Bath in 1865 and that she went to the West Coast as a mail steamer. She is said to have retained her yachting \\"speed wheel\\" to the last. In 1982, a color lithograph of the vessel was donated to the Farnsworth Art Museum.

The region derives its name from the medieval Werdenfels Castle north of Garmisch- Partenkirchen. The castle acted chiefly to secure the military and trade route that ran through the Loisach valley and linked trading posts in Italy and Upper Bavaria. It is sometimes called the Goldener Land after the wealth derived in the Middle Ages and Renaissance from the traffic along this Rottstraße, the main route over the Alps to Augsburg.  Municipalities  The cultural centre of the land is the town Garmisch-Partenkirchen. The following municipalities also belong to Werdenfelser Land proper: *Farchant *Grainau *Krün *Wallgau *Mittenwald Werdenfelser territory, or at least culture, is also by some sources said to include the Ammertal municipalities of: *Ettal *Oberammergau *Unterammergau The widest definition includes all of the Loisach and Ammer valleys as far north as the edge of the Alps along the line of the Bayersoiener See-Staffelsee-Riegsee lakes, incorporating the additional municipalities of: *Oberau *Eschenlohe *Bad Kohlgrub *Saulgrub *Bad Bayersoien *Ohlstadt *Schwaigen *Seehausen *Uffing *Murnau *Großweil  Geography  The southern Werdenfelser Land is bordered by the Wetterstein Mountains and the Karwendel. The Zugspitze lies southwest of Garmisch-Partenkirchen and, at , is the highest peak in Germany. Both the valleys and the Alpine Foreland have been heavily influenced by the last ice age. The lakes were partially formed by groundwater filling the hollows carved out by the glaciers. Later the lakes silted up and formed moors like the Murnauer Moos.  History  In the early Iron Age the Werdenfelser Land was settled by Illyrians. Even at this early stage there were close contacts with Upper Italy over the route of the present-day Brenner-Scharnitz road. From about 500 B.C. Celts invaded this region and mixed with the indigenous population. The Romans in turn conquered the Celts around 15 B.C. and annexed the region to the Province of Raetia. Occasionally the Romans adopted settlement and river names of Veneto-Illyrian or Celtic origin, some of which have survived to the present day (Partenkirchen – Partanum, Isar – Isara). The trade route that was already established by 195 A. D. was upgraded. The Via Claudia Augusta now ran from Augsburg via Partenkirchen and Mittenwald to the Brenner Pass and continued to Bozen (Pons Drusi), where it formed a junction with the older Reschen Pass branch. The Roman road station of Partanum was the predecessor of modern-day Partenkirchen. After the collapse of the Roman Empire and the end of the Migration Period, Bajuwaren settled from about the 6th century A.D. in the valleys. Werdenfels Castle, erected by Duke Otto of Wittelsbach in 1180 northwest of Partenkirchen, was transferred in 1294 to the Prince-Bishopric of Freising. Control of the northern approaches of the important European trading route by the Freising archbishopric enabled the population of the County of Werdenfels to become relatively wealthy over a long period of time. With the onset of the Modern Period there was a significant economic boom as a result of stronger trade relations with Italy (see also: Fugger, Welser). The nickname Goldenes Landl (\\"Little Golden Land\\") for the Werdenfelser Land comes from this period. This development was ended by the Thirty Years' War and the population became impoverished. Later wars, such as the Wars of the Spanish and Austrian Succession in the early 18th century and Napoleonic Wars of the 19th century, also severely affected the population. In 1803, as a result of Napoleonic rule, the Prince-Bishopric of Freising was toppled and the Werdenfelser Land was given to Bavaria. 1889 saw the advent of a new source of income as the new railway link with Munich brought tourists to the region.

It is intended to serve as a reference for accessing stories printed the previous year in the newspaper. It was created by publisher Adolph Simon Ochs, who wanted to compete with the New York Sun by offering a series of special features. The index, he believed, would be attractive to librarians and other researchers by making reliable source material widely available to the public. The index was the only one published by an American newspaper through at least the 1930s, and helped make the Times known to libraries and students nationwide as a primary source for research. Initially published quarterly, it was released in annual editions starting in 1930. In recent years, volumes of the index have been designated to cover specific months or weeks. After the success of the index was well established, the Times began publishing the New York Times Obituaries Index. In the 1960s and 1970s the Times began releasing indexes from before 1913 that had been produced for internal use. This required compiling indexes for the first time for periods 1858-62 and 1906-12 when indexing had halted \\"for reasons that cannot now be determined,\\" according to the Foreword of those volumes. In 2009, the Times began releasing metadata associated with the index to programmers and the general public.  References  * \\"Annual Times index available to public\\", The New York Times.

Their firm were also involved in other projects such as the already demolished Manager's House, the Public Suite, the Beatty Park Pool kiosk. Personal life It was during the days of working with Stephenson and Turner which Donald met his wife Janet. As for Janet, she was often seen playing the role of hostess to many RAIA committees and meetings. Initially Donald had been working with Stephenson and Turner in Melbourne. He was then given an opportunity for an overseas stint to work in England and Canada and travelling in Europe and North America for five years. He only returned to Australia in mid–fifties. Putting a couple of his notable projects aside, Donald Bailey is also the chief executive of the national secretariat of RAIA consisting of four divisional directors and a staff of eleven, including the practice division based in Melbourne. His tasks includes assisting the President in representing the Institute at the highest levels of government and in the national consultative bodies of the professions and the building industry and also the advising of RAIA Executive on policy matters in order to keep in touch with the broad spectrum of Institute activities at top level. It is widely known that different presidents have found Donald Bailey's reign within the Institute invaluable.

Vashon was the first steamboat constructed by the Martinolich Shipbuilding Company, which in 1904, under the company's founder, John Martinolich, a Croatian immigrant, had set up a shipyard on Vashon Island at the small settlement of Dockton. The Vashon Navigation Company intended Vashon to replace their steamer Norwood which had not performed well against the Burton, a new vessel placed in service in 1905 by the rival Tacoma and Burton Navigation Co. Vashon competed with Burton, and later Burton's replacement, Magnolia by racing from landing to landing trying to be the first to pick up passengers or embark freight.

In model species such as the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the primate Homo sapiens (See RANGAP1) and the plant Arabidopsis thaliana, it acts as a GTPase-activating protein, catalysing the conversion of cytosolically-bound RanGTP to RanGDP. It has the opposite function of the RCC1, a nuclear-located protein that converts RanGDP to RanGTP. Together, RanGAP and RCC1 maintain what is known as the ran gradient, where RanGDP is in higher concentrations in the cytosol, while RanGTP is in higher concentrations in the nucleus. It is this ran gradient which provides the energy necessary for the transport of proteins into and out of the nucleus by karyopherin proteins. Location in cell In mammalian and plant cells, RanGAP is located at the nuclear envelope during interphase. Animal RanGAP is bound to the nuclear pore component RANBP2 (Nup358). Plant RanGAP proteins do not contain the protein domain necessary for association with Nup358 but are targeted to the nuclear rim by the plant-specific WPP domain. In contrast to plant and animal cells, yeast RanGAP is located in the cytosol. RanGAP and the origin of eukaryotes Together with RCC1 and components of the nuclear pore, RanGAP has been suggested to have evolved at the origin of eukaryotes.

It encourages communication and connects the people of the community and across cultures. History Since the commencement of Community Radio in the early 1990s, it has become increasing popular, especially in rural communities. Community radio’s rise in South Africa is attributable to the dismantling of apartheid and an example of building a democracy and civil society within the country. The community radio division was officially formed in 1993 by a parliamentary Act – Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA) Act. This was formed to democratise the radio broadcasters, to encourage ownership and to ensure that there was no meddling from the South African government at the time From 1994 onwards, the IBA began issuing community stations with temporarily 12-month licenses to broadcast. Two years later, in 1996, South Africa’s regulations for Community Radio allowed four year licensing When the request to apply for a four year licensing was issued, the supervisory body received about 252 applications, when they had been expecting much less Today, there are over 100 community radio stations, in all nine provinces which are licensed to broadcast, which includes ethnic and religious stations Funding Funding can be an immense problem, especially when radio stations are serving communities and are incapable to support it, because of various social and economic underdevelopments There are many struggling stations who find it difficult to generate an income, because of the impoverished communities they serve. Most community radio stations are funded by external donor countries and international development agencies while other stations rely on advertising, sponsorship and voluntary services; however the lack thereof leads to a lack of funds to reward their presenters sufficiently. As a result, numerous community radio stations have inexperienced staff members. Stations are managed by a board of directors and a committee which is elected by the community. Smaller community radios operate with minimal equipment. Added to this, there are some stations functioning on temporary one-year licenses, as an alternative to the full four-year licenses, which is adding additional difficulty to the production of income and financial planning. President of the World Association of Community Broadcasters (AMARC, by its French initials), Steve Buckley noted that state subsidies for community media are the norm in Europe and North America, but it largely lacking in Africa, particularly in South Africa. Licensing Licensing for community radio broadcast services is considered necessary, as it ensures fair and equitable access the radio spectrum. Licensing should be designed to support the development of the radio station, which should not restrict them in any way, or to be controlled and monitored by the South African government over broadcast content as well as ownership. The entire process should be clear of government interference. Licensing procedures should be fair and apparent and set out in law. It should be the responsibility of an independent licensing body. There should be no unnecessary obstacles that would exclude communities from having a radio broadcaster. The process of applying must be responsive to the demands of the community, as it is community based. There ought to be no unreasonable technical, economic or other barriers to gain entry for a license. Criteria for the station should be primarily based on demonstrating social purpose and benefit and sufficient requirements for the community participation in ownership and function of the service.

He lives and paints in Kolkata (former Calcutta), West Bengal. While his early works were mainly oils and sketchy portraits, Basu later worked with acrylics on canvas and occasionally pencil or charcoal drawings. Personal life Sukanta Basu was born in Calcutta (now Kolkata) on 13 June 1929 to the scientist (Chemistry) Rajani Kanta Basu and Sneha Sarit Basu. For part of his childhood he was raised in Muzaffarpur in North Bihar, where his father had a permanent post in the British India's Bihar Educational Service. The family moved to Bankura, West Bengal, for a few years due to threat of Japanese attack. =Family= Rajani Kanta and Sneha Sarit Basu raised nine sons and three daughters; Sukanta is the couple's ninth child. Sukanta, Prashanta (10th sibling) and Sushanta Basu (11th sibling) had an especially thick bond strengthened by their communist ideals, under the influence of the 7th sibling Abani Kanta. On abortion of the Communist connection, Sukanta went on to study Art, Prasanta - Medicine and Sushanta – Humanities (English Literature). The Basu family had literary and artistic inclinations; for example the eldest sister Arati (2nd sibling) was schooled at home, studied music, wrote in Bengali and drew pictures. The 3rd sibling Niladri was passionate about Rabindra Sangeet and the 5th brother Rabindranath is a published story writer. Minati, the second sister and 8th sibling went to school, studied music and wrote elegant Bengali prose. The youngest sister Pranati studied to receive a post graduate degree in Philosophy. =Education= While Basu was still in school in Bankura, he earned the affectionate nickname Chitrakar (painter/artist) from the Bengali scholar Acharya Jogesh Chandra Ray Vidyanidhi who also lived in Bankura. After his matriculation, Basu went to college in Calcutta, but soon dropped out feeling alienated in the system. He took some time away from institutional education, later passed his intermediate science exam and joined the Chemistry Honours programme at St. Xavier's college, Calcutta. Basu experienced a lack of interest and got involved with student politics; he dropped out again. Finally, he prepared himself to practice arts, and attended the Indian Art School for a few months, in order to prepare himself for the Government College of Art and Craft at the University of Calcutta. At art school, he trained under artist Prodosh Das Gupta. As schoolmates, Bijon Chowdhury, Somnath Hore and Sukanta Basu were friends during this period. When the student's movement in Bengal became very intense, and the Communist Party of India was banned under B.C. Roy's regime, Somnath Hore and Bijon Chowdhury had to leave school. The three remained close friends even thereafter. Basu graduated in 1954. =Marriage= Basu married the late Iola Leela Lawton, a South Indian, a gold-medallist & one of the first women graduates of the Government School of Art, Calcutta; she was the first Asian to win a National Design Diploma in all of UK, 1954. Returning to India to work with The All India Handicrafts Board both as Deputy Director & designer for master- craftsmen, the couple met in New Delhi. Basu's stepdaughter Pria Devi, works as a writer [ art & culture], in New Delhi; she writes poetry and is working on a novel. Mr & Mrs Basu had no children. Iola died in 2003. Sukanta returned to Kolkata in 2004. Career Basu had difficulties to maintain a fluent course as a full-time artist, and did survival jobs for his basic upkeep and materials. On graduating from art school in 1954, Basu joined B.N. Academy in a small town called Suri, Birbhum district, as a drawing teacher. By the autumn break Basu fell ill and could not return to Suri to his job. By the year end, he joined a printing press- Calcutta Chromotype in Calcutta. There he engaged with technical aspects of colour analysis and feasibility testing. After a year of working with the press, Basu was jobless as a result of a lock-out at the factory. His friend and well-wisher Dilip Das Gupta got him a teaching job at the Indian Art College where he worked alongside his old friend Somnath Hore. In 1959 Basu applied to the National Gallery of Modern Art, New Delhi for the post of a conservator, was appointed and worked with the gallery until his retirement in 1985. He is the first appointed conservator in India. Basu was sent to Rome, Italy to be trained for a year in 1960 and in 1977 for a month in London at the Courtauld Institute of Art. In the early 1980s, Sotheby's claimed works by European artists including Thomas Daniell, which Prime Minister Indira Gandhi almost agreed to give away. Basu was part of the group which opposed this move, and worked to retain these works which were then categorized as 'Indian Art of European Origin'. He also played a significant part in the creation of The National Museum Institute of History of Art, Conservation and Museology in 1983. Basu has handled some of the most controversial works of Amrita Sher-Gil (donated to NGMA by her sister Indira Sundaram) at the outset of his conservation career, and has restored valuable works by the Bengal school of art, Jamini Roy, Tagore, Petar Lubarda among others, now part of the gallery's permanent collection. During his tenure, he was an advisor and friend to artists like Vasudeo S. Gaitonde, Biren De, and close friends with Tyeb Mehta, who helped Basu exhibit his works in Pundole gallery (former Bombay). Basu continued to paint and showed his works in New Delhi and Bombay, but from the late 1970s to circa 1997 he was dormant as a painter, because of his position at National Gallery of Modern Art, and from 1983 at the National Museum, New Delhi. In 1990, Basu set up the New Delhi unit of the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH). He worked there till his retirement from conservation in 1997. Basu began painting again in the late 1990s. Since then, he has occasionally been showing his work in New Delhi, Kolkata and Pune. Art Until the early 1960s Basu worked with oils on canvas rendering landscapes, made sketchy portraits and drawings, he then turned to non-representational works. While the range of Basu's works may be thematically located within post-colonial and post-modern, his style remains distinct and difficult to label as such. None of his works are titled. His works are characterized by an appearance of vastness, regardless of the canvas dimension. Post 1960s, one sees a consistent engagement with an unknown source of light, in an attempt to decipher the grammar of an art, which does not need words to support it. The artist is prudent in terms of adventurous experimentation, and minimalistic; his works seldom have more than three colours, and he does not use a palette or an easel. Instead of colour, line and form as primary requirements, Basu's approach uses colour and surface as foundational elements.

The case decided that an employee had to consent before a burden was placed on him by a change in employer. Facts Mr Nokes had worked for the Hickleton Main Co Ltd until 4 June 1937, when the Chancery Court gave an order for the business to be transferred under the Companies Act 1929, section 154(1), on arrangements and reconstructions to Doncaster Amalgamated Collieries Ltd. Mr Nokes was absent and would be liable to pay damages to the new business under the Employers and Workmen Act 1875, section 4, if he had a service contract with the company, which he denied. However, the Divisional Court and the Court of Appeal ordered him to pay 15s (approx. £50 today) in damages and 10s (approx. £33 today) in costs. He appealed to the House of Lords. Judgment The House of Lords held, by a majority, that Mr Nokes did not have to pay the fee because his employment could not be transferred without his consent. Viscount Simon LC said that it is 'a fundamental principle of our common law... that a free citizen, in the exercise of his freedom, is entitled to choose the employer whom he promises to serve, so that the right to his services cannot be transferred from one employer to another without his assent'.[1940] AC 1014, 1020 Lord Atkin vigorously denied that Employers and Workmen Act 1875 could result in a fine for the worker and went so far as to say that he regarded any automatic transfer rule would be 'tainted with oppression and confiscation'. He wrote the following.[1940] AC 1014, 1026-1030 Lord Thankerton and Lord Porter concurred. Lord Romer dissented.

It focuses on fostering interfaith dialogue on a grassroots level and creating interreligious harmony. The JICRC is currently run by its founder and director, Father Nabil Haddad.  History  King Abdullah II. Father Nabil Haddad established the JICRC in 2003. He founded the center on what he described as “the belief that an approach of togetherness is needed to expand upon the conviction that all values, morals, and religions guide us to peace. JICRC calls for mutual respect and dignity for all people as human beings by emphasizing that we are all children of Adam.”  Location  The JICRC is based out of its headquarters on Jebel Al- Weibdeh in Amman, Jordan. It is situated in between Luzmilla Hospital and the site of the oldest cathedral in Jordan. Work The JICRC participates in many interfaith dialogue events. It has worked with the US Department of State and the US nonprofit Amideast program. Public figures including John Kerry and Laura Bush have publicly commended the JICRC for its interfaith dialogue work. The JICRC plays an advisory role to both the Jordanian Government and other non-governmental organizations. The center also holds events in collaboration with the government to promote interfaith harmony, such as its February 2011 “Harmony: Jordan as a Model”, a celebration of the United Nations’ World Interfaith Harmony Week held in concert with the Jordanian Ministry of Islamic Affairs under the patronage of Prince Ghazi bin Mohammad. The JICRC frequently hosts visiting groups of students, religious leaders, politicians, and academics. The JICRC also offers an internship program for current students and recent graduates. Programs The JICRC continues to be globally active through hosting and attending various conferences to promote interfaith dialogue and peaceful coexistence among different faiths. Over the past decade, the JICRC has launched several successful programs which seek to foster positive interfaith relations in Jordan, in the Middle East, and around the world. \\"Imams for Coexistence\\" is an effort to present to other societies the moderate voices of the Muslim world working for harmony, tolerance, moderation, and peaceful coexistence with others. This program brought imams to the United States in order to introduce young, progressive leaders to the culture, history, and society of the West and allow them to witness how different religions are expressed and peacefully in the western realm. \\"Imams for Coexistence\\" also gives the imams opportunities to interact with western societies in a positive and constructive way through participating in dialogues at public events, where they can discuss Islamic perspectives on human rights, democracy, and gender, while allowing them to address misconceptions and misunderstandings of Islam prevalent in a post-September 11 American and western society. \\"Women for Coexistence\\" consists of initiatives of workshops, camps and conferences, which provide an open forum for women to interact using the core interfaith values as a foundation for building harmony, religious coexistence, cultural understanding, gender equality, and peace. \\"Youth for Coexistence\\" provides a venue for Muslim and Christian youth to dialogue and to build relationships of respect and understanding. Youth who have the passion and the capacity to promote peace and understanding between the faith traditions will become the most effective future spokespersons for the cause of peaceful coexistence. The program includes conferences, camps and workshops. The purpose of this program is to involve youth in the development of grass roots program initiatives related to the JICRC’s Document on Islamic- Christian Interfaith Coexistence. \\"Media and Coexistence\\" is a newer project which seeks to promote balanced portrayal of interfaith relations in Jordanian media, empowering young journalists to use social media and learn more about the Jordanian model of interfaith harmony.

It is among the few short films of the series Disney worked on before leaving that same year. Overview Previously in 1927, Oswald had an oval face, a chubbier waist, and pants with a single suspender. By 1928, he's given a makeover, having a rounder head, a slimmer waist, and shorts. Despite this change, the rabbit's 1927 appearance would still appear on the title cards until High Up. His shorts would be his only outfit until 1930. Plot summary A show composed of a concert, circus acts, and broadway is taking place at a theater in the city. One of the stars of the show is a lady cat dancer whom Oswald suddenly has affection for upon seeing a poster. For admission, patrons have to pay 50 cents. Unfortunately for Oswald, his pockets are empty. Oswald notices a stage entrance where performers and certain officials can come in, and admission is unnecessary. Because of this, Oswald comes up with an idea of impersonating a performer by bulging his chest (possibly pretending to be a stuntman). The guard by the door isn't deceived and prevents the penniless rabbit from coming in. After a bit of a struggle, Oswald ties the guard to a lamp post and proceeds toward the inside of the theater. However, he is forced back outside by the glaring performers. While thinking of a way to get back in, Oswald sees a man in a thick fur coat coming out of a taxi and heading towards the theater entrance. Oswald hides under the man's shadow. As the man with the coat enters, the guard becomes suspicious upon noticing a lump on the shadow. Thinking he made it inside undetected, Oswald comes out but doesn't notice the guard approaching him. When he realizes the guard was right behind him, Oswald quickly makes his move. Oswald prevails in losing the guard by going inside a cage. However, he is met with more trouble when the cage contains a jaguar. The jaguar chases him into the stage where acrobats are doing a balancing act with a long pole. Oswald climbs up the pole and grabs the ceiling for his safety. One of the acrobats also goes up the pole and clings onto the rabbit's legs. Bothered by having someone hanging under him, Oswald grabs a mallet and strikes off the acrobat. Oswald plunges down and drops on the jaguar. The jaguar is angered more than ever and the frightened Oswald flees the stage. Other vicious animals, such as the lions, break out of their cages, forcing everyone else to leave the theater. Believing everyone disappeared from the scene, Oswald comes out of a toilet booth, only to realize that one lion is still in the vicinity. The lion chases him into the horizon as the cartoon ends. Versions The cartoon has two versions that differ in the soundtrack used. One of them features a couple of jazz tunes (the second of which is Tiger Rag). The other features calliope music which is used throughout the entire film, as well as some footage played in reverse.

His rule began in 115 BC and ended with his death in 112 BC. In Vietnamese history, he is considered a king of Vietnam. In 113 BC, Emperor Wu of Han sent Anguo Shaoji (安國少季) to summon Zhao Xing and the Queen Dowager Jiu to Chang'an for an audience with the Emperor. The Queen Dowager Jiu, who was Han Chinese, was regarded as a foreigner by the Nanyue people, and it was widely rumored that she had an illicit relationship with Anguo Shaoji before she married Zhao Yingqi. When Anguo arrived, quite a number of people believed the two resumed their relationship. The Queen Dowager feared that there would be a revolt against her authority so she urged the king and his ministers to seek closer times to the Han. Xing agreed to and proposed that relations between Nanyue and the Han should be normalized with a triennial journey to the Han court as well as the removal of custom barriers along the border. The prime minister Lü Jia (呂嘉) held military power and his family was more well connected than either the king or the Queen Dowager. According to the Shiji and Đại Việt sử ký toàn thư, Lü Jia was chief of a Lạc Việt tribe, related to King Qin of Cangwu by marriage, and over 70 of his kinsmen served as officials in various parts of the Nanyue court. Lü refused to meet the Han envoys which angered the Queen Dowager. She tried to kill him at a banquet but was stopped by Xing. The Queen Dowager tried to gather enough support at court to kill Lü in the following months. When news of the situation reached Emperor Wu of Han in 112 BC, he ordered Zhuang Can to lead a 2,000 men expedition to Nanyue. However Zhuang refused to accept the mission, declaring that it was illogical to send so many men under the pretext of peace, but so few to enforce the might of the Han. The former prime minister of Jibei, Han Qianqiu (韓千秋), offered to lead the expedition and arrest Lü Jia. When Han crossed the Han-Nanyue border, Lü conducted a coup, killing Xing, Queen Dowager Jiu and all the Han emissaries in the capital. Xing's brother, Zhao Jiande, was declared the new king. The Temple name of Zhao Xing was not mentioned in both Shiji and Hanshu. But according to the Vietnamese historical text Đại Việt sử ký toàn thư, Zhao Xing's Posthumous name was Ai Vương (哀王, pinyin: Āi Wáng).

The two-hour special featured two heterosexual men competing for a $50,000 prize based on their ability to pass as gay for a week, including convincing their friends and family that they, the competitors, were actually gay. At its conclusion, the two would be judged by a panel of gay men, including Jared Sullivan, who had been told one of them was gay. The contestant selected by the panel as gay would win the money.Fox Drops 'Seriously, Dude, I'm Gay' Seriously was produced by Rocket Science Laboratories, the same company that produced other Fox-aired reality series including Joe Millionaire, Temptation Island and My Big Fat Obnoxious Fiance.Fox cancels 'Seriously, Dude, I'm Gay' reality special Criticism Seriously drew the condemnation of the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, which called the special \\"an exercise in systematic humiliation\\". Among the objectionable content, GLAAD noted the contestants' description of their experience as \\"their worst nightmare\\" and being \\"trapped in gay hell\\". One contestant had to tell a former wrestling teammate that his participation in the sport was based on his desire for \\"close contact with sweaty boys\\" and later had to trick an unsuspecting gay man on a blind date with him to agree to a second date. GLAAD scheduled a meeting with the network to discuss its concerns. On May 26, within hours of setting up the meeting, Fox announced that the special had been pulled from the schedule. Fox publicly attributed the decision to \\"creative issues\\" but an anonymous source inside Fox said that GLAAD's intervention was welcomed following the failure of the network's earlier gay-themed reality program, Playing It Straight. In addition to the program's content, Fox also received criticism for its promotional material, including describing the gay judges as a \\"jury of their queers\\". The network later apologized for its \\"failed attempt at humor\\" that was \\"ill-chosen and inappropriate\\".FOX apologizes for \\"inappropriate\\" joke Several of the gay men involved with the production of Seriously sharply criticized GLAAD for its response to the special. \\"It's unfortunate that a group as well-intentioned as GLAAD is going to set themselves up as censors and judge what other people should be allowed to air or see. Our primary purpose was to be funny, but if people actually got to see the show, they would probably be more tolerant of gay people in the future,\\" said creative consultant Christian McLaughlin. Executive producer Ray Giuliani concurred, saying, \\"I am gay; I have a boyfriend; I live in West Hollywood; I have gay friends. The idea that I would do something I would consider homophobic is crazy. [The contestants] walked away learning something about what it feels like to be a gay man in the middle of a straight world.\\" Jackie Beat, a drag performer who appeared on the series in his male identity as a \\"mantor\\" (adviser) to the contestants, said, \\"GLAAD should have no problem with the show because gay people do not come across negatively in any way. What they don't see is that it's obviously poking fun at the straight dudes.\\" One of those \\"straight dudes\\", Larry Anderson, who was at the time of filming a 28-year-old salesman from Massachusetts, credited Seriously with helping him conquer his own homophobia and believed it would have shown that stereotypes about gay men are not accurate.

It is today part of Carlin America. Background The company was founded in Los Angeles in 1945 by Austrian-born Julian Aberbach and his business partners Milton Blink and Gerald King, who owned Biltmore Music.Ronnie Pugh, Ernest Tubb: The Texas Troubadour, p.117 Aberbach's brother Jean joined in the early 1950s after working for Chappell Music, and thereafter the two shared control of the company, with Jean Aberbach being based in the Brill Building in New York City. After initially finding success representing Spade Cooley and Bob Wills, the company became active in the country music industry, particularly in Nashville, and at one point were reportedly responsible for three-quarters of all the music produced in Nashville. In 1955, the Aberbachs were responsible for setting up an unprecedented arrangement in which the publishing rights to all songs recorded by emerging star performer Elvis Presley were split 50:50 between the Hill & Range company and Presley and his management. The Aberbach brothers established their younger cousin, Freddy Bienstock, as head of Elvis Presley Music - in effect, a subsidiary of Hill & Range. It also employed writers (including Leiber and Stoller) to provide songs for Presley's films and albums. This arrangement effectively precluded Presley from recording material not licensed to Hill & Range, from the mid-1950s through to the early 1970s.John Shepherd, Continuum Encyclopedia of Popular Music of the World, Volume 1, p.586 Biography of Julian Aberbach by Jason Ankeny at Allmusic Autobiography at Julian Aberbach website Hill & Range gradually expanded to become the largest independent music publishing company, with worldwide interests. The company employed many of the top pop songwriters of the day, including Doc Pomus, Mort Shuman, and Phil Spector, as well as Leiber and Stoller.John Broven, Record makers and breakers: voices of the independent rock 'n' roll pioneers, p.269 In 1964, it bought Progressive Music, the publishing company operated by Atlantic Records. In 1973, Julian Aberbach suffered an incapacitating heart attack, and in 1975 his brother Jean sold much of the business to Chappell Music, then a subsidiary of the PolyGram organization, although it retained control of the companies connected to Presley. Chappell Music was in turn acquired in 1984 by Bienstock.

It is located in the Albertinum in Dresden. The collection of the Dresden Skulpturensammlung ranges in age more than five millennia, from classical antiquity to the art of the Renaissance, Baroque, and Expressionism until the 21st century. Sculptures from the likes of Polycletus to Giambologna and Permoser, and from Rodin to Lehmbruck are included in the collection. History Edgar Degas, Little Dancer of Fourteen Years The origins of the museum can be traced back to the Kunstkammer founded in 1560. However, it was August the Strong who established the “Collection of Antique and Modern Sculptures” and turned Dresden into a centre of Baroque architecture and sculpture. After the arrival of antiquities from Rome at the end of 1729, the collection was displayed in the palace in the Großer Garten, surrounded by masterpieces of contemporary sculpture. In 1786 the collection was rearranged and exhibited in the Japanisches Palais. After the archaeologist Georg Treu (1843–1921) took over as director of the museum in 1882, the collection particularly flourished. Over the three decades of his tenure, Treu instituted a systematic acquisitions policy to build up the collection. The Renaissance Zeughaus (Arsenal) on the Brühlsche Terrasse was converted for use as a museum and in 1889 the Antiquities Collection was able to move into the building, which was thereafter called the Albertinum. Treu continued the tradition of displaying antiquities alongside contemporary works. The collection was the first to acquire numerous works by Auguste Rodin and Constantin Meunier in Germany. Although the Albertinum was partially destroyed in February 1945, most of the collection survived the Second World War, but for some large plaster casts. Almost all the original sculptures were taken to the Soviet Union, but were returned to Dresden in 1958. Following the restoration and refurbishment of the Albertinum, the Skulpturensammlung and the Galerie Neue Meister will only now display works from the Romantic period to the present day. The antiquities will be on view in display storerooms until they are able to move back into their old home in a few years’ time. The Osthalle (eastern wing) of the Semperbau was designed in the mid-19th century by Gottfried Semper specifically for the antique sculpture collection. Exhibition Auguste Rodin, The Thinker The exhibition of the Skulpturensammlung begins with works by the French sculptor Auguste Rodin. He heralded the age of modern statuary and sculpture and is regarded as the forerunner of the numerous styles developed during the 20th century. The sculpture of the classical modern period and post-1945 exhibited in the Albertinum amplifies Rodin’s principle of the subjectivity of art. This principle continues to be visible within the contemporary sculpture of today. The exhibition also pays particular attention to art created during the GDR era through works by artists such as Wieland Förster, Werner Stötzer, and Helmut Heinze. The Albertinum now includes two new galleries displaying works of a specific theme. The Klingersaal was designed by the Skulpturensammlung and the Galerie Neue Meister as a space in which both sculpture and paintings can be harmoniously exhibited together. The Klingersaal is devoted to the art of the late 19th century movement the ‘Fin de siècle’. The ‘Fin de Siècle’ movement is illustrated through various works by Arnold Böcklin and Max Klinger to those of Franz von Stuck and Sascha Schneider. The Mosaiksaal is dedicated to the theme of morality, which is exemplified by sculptures from the Classicist period with the particular emphasis of those by Ernst Rietschel. The Skulpturensammlung holds works dating from more than five millennia: from the cultures of classical antiquity to the various periods of European statuary from the early Middle Ages to the sculpture of today. In a few years’ time, the core holdings of the collection, with the inclusion of the Antiquities Collection (comprising sculptures such as the “Dresden Boy”, as well as vases, bronzes, and terracotta), will be presented in a new exhibition within the Osthalle (eastern wing) of the Semper Building. The Osthalle was originally designed by Gottfried Semper to house the classical sculpture collection. Until that time, visitors may get a preview of the future exhibition by looking in the experimental display storeroom on the ground floor of the Albertinum, where a selection of the Antiquities Collection is currently on display.

The large number of Christian religious finds from the site have prompted its identification with a monastery described by a pilgrim, Theodosius the archdeacon, in his De Situ Terrae Sanctae, a work of the early 6th century. The building was constructed in the 4th century on the remains of an earlier Herodian building identified with the Second Temple courthouse, and was destroyed during the Persian sack of Jerusalem in 614. Excavations The southern Wall of the Temple Mount. The Monastery of the Virgins lies beyond steps leading up to the Triple Huldah Gate The building identified as the Monastery of the Virgins was unearthed in Area XV of Mazar's excavations of the Ophel on behalf of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Carried out between 1968 and 1977, the excavations revealed that a crowded residential neighbourhood stood in the area to the immediate south of the Temple Mount enclosure during Jerusalem's Byzantine Period. from the Triple Huldah Gate, at the foot of the Temple Mount's southern wall, the excavators revealed a structure whose plan resembled a typical Byzantine courtyard house, with wings arranged around a central courtyard. Built on top in the remains of a large Second Temple Period building and an older burial cave, the house featured three stories of which the basement and ground floor were well preserved. The excavation of the building yielded earlier Iron Age II shards, including a LMLK seal and the head of a fertility figurine. However, as a result of the building's excellent state of preservation digging beneath its floors was abandoned in order to allow its display to the public. Measuring by , the structure was built in the early 4th century as a single spacious unit. Its ground floor included the courtyard, a kitchen, shops and staircases leading to the basement and the floor above, which housed a chapel. In the mid-6th century the northern and southern wings of its ground floor were modified and sealed off from the rest of the building. A destruction layer testifies to the destruction of the building in a great conflagration, probably during the Persian sack of the city in 614. In the destruction layer were found the remnants of the upper floor, which collapsed into the floor below. The remains of weapons, probably the defenders', were also found at the site. These include a sword, a scabbard, a pickaxe, a dagger and an umbo, a rare feature of the Byzantine weapons repertoire. While adjacent areas were built over during the subsequent Islamic periods, the building in area XV was left undisturbed. This allowed for its excellent state of preservation. It is currently accessible to visitors to the Jerusalem Archaeological Park at the foot of the Al-Aqsa Mosque. =Finds= Multiple items of ecclesiastical nature were found in the structure. These include fragments of marble chancel screens, an altar table and a Second-Temple era stone ossuary in use as a reliquary and containing a skull. Crosses were ubiquitous, including on roof tiles, oil lamps, door knockers, and several bronze crosses, one of which was in length. Several fragments of a chancel screen depict two deer, Christian symbols of faith and devotion mentioned in , facing a cross planted on the Hill of Golgotha. A stone lintel was found depicting a cross enclosed within a wreath. Additional finds include copper alloy chains and incense bowls,Mazar 1999, pp. 17 copper alloy lock and clasps decorated with the image of an arched entrance to a church,Mazar 1999, pp. 15 a sinuous dragon-headed arm from a multi-armed copper candelabra, and a copper hearth with decorative animal legs complete with rings for suspension.Mazar 1999, pp. 41-42 In the northern section of the building which included the kitchen and several storage rooms, were found multiple storage jars. In some of these were found remnants of the food they once contained, including lentil and chickpea.Mazar 1999, pp. 37 Identification =Monastery of the Virgins= The large number of Christian items found in the structure have led to its identification with a monastery described by Theodosius the archdeacon in his De Situ Terrae Sanctae (On the Topography of the Holy Land). Theodosius describes a monastery of nuns at the foot of the Temple Mount's southeastern corner: The excavators believe that the monastery had initially occupied the entire structure. In the 5th century, however, Jerusalem was granted patriarchal status and the following century saw the city develop and expand. As population density in Jerusalem grew, the needs of numerous pilgrims to the holy city led to a reduction in the Monastery's area in favour of public facilities. In the mid 6th century, two wings were detached from the monastery and sealed off, the northern wing to act as a public kitchen and the southern converted into a row of shops. Food for the monastery was prepared in the public kitchen and delivered through two windows left open between the two sections of the building. Adjacent buildings have aided the identification of the building as a monastery. from the Temple Mount wall, behind the monastery, stood a vaulted chamber with a sloping floor. This has been identified as a collection vat for wine, above which once stood a winery, a common feature of Byzantine monasteries. A two story structure to the east of the Monastery may have served as a hospice. Thirty well-preserved rooms were found on its ground floor, as was a red cross painted on a lintel in the building, and large watering pool on the outside. While the building certainly was a monastery, certain finds nevertheless cast doubt on its identification with Theodosius' Monastery of the Virgins. Theodosius's description dates from the early 6th century, while the structural modifications isolating the central portion have only been dated to the mid 6th century, and possibly later. Furthermore, Greek inscriptions found in the building feature no women, only men, including one reading \\"for the offering and salvation of the Timotheus the priest\\". The identification of the site with Theodosius' monastery was first proposed by Yizhar Hirschfeld. Yoram Tsafrir has suggested that the monastery may have been located on the slopes below of the Temple Mount which have not yet been excavated or even in the hollows of the Temple Mount itself, within Solomon's Stables. No evidence has been found to corroborate either suggestions. =Second Temple Courthouse= Underneath the coarse stones of the Byzantine walls, the walls of the monastery were built of large finely dressed stones, plastered and molded at the joints, a feature of Herodian construction. The monastery had been built over the remains of a large Second-Temple-era building which had stood adjacent to a major entrance to the Herodian Temple Mount. Benjamin Mazar had suggested that this may have been a courthouse of the Sanhedrin, the supreme Jewish judicial and legislative body, a building referred to in the Mishnah, Tractate Sanhedrin 11.2. Additional support for this identification comes from a fragment of a Hebrew inscription found nearby. The inscription contained the word \\"[z]\\" (elders), probably referring to the Sanhedrin. Publication Although completed in 1977, the results of the Temple Mount excavations had not been published by Benjamin Mazar's death in 1995. In 1996 the Institute of Archaeology of the Hebrew University authorized his granddaughter, Eilat Mazar, to publish the finds. Eilat Mazar had been her grandfather's research assistant, an area supervisor in the nearby City of David excavations, and had directed her own excavation in the Ophel in 1986-1987. The excavation report for area XV and the Monastery of the Virgins was finally published in 2003.

Relatively easy to build with unskilled, often forced labour, but still militarily formidable, these castles were built across northern Europe from the 10th century onwards, spreading from Normandy and Anjou in France, into the Holy Roman Empire in the 11th century. The Normans introduced the design into England and Wales following their invasion in 1066. Motte-and-bailey castles were adopted in Scotland, Ireland, the Low Countries and Denmark in the 12th and 13th centuries. By the end of the 13th century, the design was largely superseded by alternative forms of fortification, but the earthworks remain a prominent feature in many countries.

(Archibald George) Thornton (1886–1969) was a British novelist, short story writer and journalist. He authored three popular novels which were noted for their realism and humour.  Life and works  Thornton was born in Secunderabad, India, the son of James Thornton, a physical drill teacher, and Mary Thornton. The family returned to England soon after, and Thornton was raised in Hornsey, Middlesex. In 1911, their residence was 8 Summerhill Road, South Tottenham, London.Census 1911 He became a well-known journalist after be began writing humorous articles in The Star.The Bookman, Vols 66–67, Hodder and Stoughton, 1924, p.30 He later joined the literary staff of the Daily Chronicle. Between 1920 and 1951, Thornton contributed 27 short stories to The Star. He won the 1923 Andrew Melrose prize for his humorous novel An Astronomer at Large. It tells how a famous astronomer, past middle age, discovers that real life has eluded him in his devotion to his work and sets out to recapture what he has missed. The Bookman commented: “An Innocent Abroad on Epsom Downs, fun from cover to cover.\\"https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http://64.62.200.70/PERIODICAL/PDF/Bookman-1924oct/86-89/&chrome;=true Thornton also wrote John Comes Home and Summer Sowing, both published in 1927.Frederick Wilse Bateson, The New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature, Volume 5, Page cccxciv According to The Spectator John Comes Home: \\"describes the evolution of a boy who wins his way from humble circumstances to become a successful business position. John Presber, the son of a mechanic, is destined by his father for an engineering \\"hand.\\" But, by dint of pluck, economy and perseverance, his mother gets him into a solicitor's office. John's home and Mrs. Presber's subtle mastery of her husband are well represented, as also are John's early days in the City of twenty years ago, his first flirtations, and his friendships with Victor Godfrey, a gadfly youth who lures him into perils from which he emerges safely at last into the arms of his first true love. The story is spun of homely stuff but deserves attention for its fidelity to life and its humour.The Spectator, 29 April, 1927, p. 24 The same year, his short story \\"The Second Chance\\" appeared in John O'London's Weekly (30 July 1927). In 1960, Thornton published a philosophical-religious work The Ultimate You, in which he countered what he saw as contemporary pessimism by arguing for the centrality of man in the universe.

The original language was superseded by ZPL II, but it is not fully compatible with the older version. Meanwhile, ZPL II is emulated by many label printers of various producers. Later, the Zebra BASIC Interpreter (ZBI) was integrated into printer software, which is seen as an advancement to ZPL II by the producer and is ANSI BASIC oriented. Primarily, it is intended to avoid a refactoring of code when changing the printer, if the old printer software was written by a label printer of a competitor. A possible use of ZBI could be for when the Zebra printer receives a foreign label format, which it would then convert to ZPL II on the fly so it can be printed. Commands The language commands always start with a caret ('\`^\`') or tilde sign ('\`~\`'). Currently, more than 170 commands exist in ZPL II. Each format has to start with the command \`^XA\` and end with \`^XZ\`.

Life The parlour from 2 Henrietta Street, London, the main panels have been attributed to Vincenzo Damini, Victoria and Albert Museum Damini was born in Venice towards the end of the 17th century. He was a pupil of Giovanni Antonio Pellegrini, whom he accompanied to England in about 1720. His portrait of the London scenery painter John Devoto is known from a mezzotint after it, made by John Faber. In the north transept of Lincoln Cathedral, he executed a wall painting of four bishops beneath Gothic canopies, replacing an older version of the same subject; his assistant while working on it was the English artist Giles Hussey. Also in Lincoln, he painted a fresco of the Ascension in the chancel and apse of the church of St Peter-at-Arches. The church was demolished in the 1930s, but Damini's oil modello for the work survives. Previously in the Parish Church of St Giles in Lincoln, the modello was sold at Christies in 2009 Five decorative paintings inset into the plaster ceiling of a room designed by James Gibbs for a house in Henrietta Street, London, are attributed to Damini. The entire room, dating from around 1727-32 is preserved in the Victoria and Albert Museum. He returned to Italy in 1730, accompanied by Giles Hussey, whom, according to Edward Edwards he abandoned in Bologna, making off with his belongings. By 1737 he was in L'Aquila, in Abruzzo, where, in that year, he painted an altarpiece at the church of the monastery of San Giuliano. There are three works by him in the collection of the Museo Nazionale d'Abruzzo: Il battesimo di Gesù (1740), San Tommaso d'Aquino incatena l'eresia (1739) and Carlo d'Angiò ai piedi della Vergine e San Tommaso d'Aquino (1741).

It is published in English, with Afrikaans mixed in. In late 2013, the Daily Voice was the most-read daily newspaper in the Cape Town metropolitan area with 456,000 readers, and a total daily readership of 528,000. History and focus Daily Voice was launched on 16 March 2005 in the Western Cape, selling at the price of R1.50. Its publication was a reaction to the success of the tabloid Daily Sun, published by Media24 and begun in 2002, and was part of a \\"tabloidisation\\" wave in the country. The Daily Voice was also modelled after the tabloid The Sun in the UK. Initially, the paper focused stories on their tag-line \\"sex, scandal, skinner, sport\\". Daily Voice has a team of local journalists to report on stories which are original, relevant and produced for their specific audience. The motto of the paper in Afrikaans is \\"Ons skrik vir niks\\" (English: \\"We are not scared of anything\\"). The former executive editor, Karl Brophy, explained that the paper accommodates the socioeconomic classes who have perhaps been left out by the rest of the country’s newspapers. The Daily Voice attracts a dominant Cape Coloured community. The targeted readership speaks a mixture of English and Afrikaans, which is typical of the Cape Flats and is why the paper is multilingual. The Daily Voice has a section where readers can share their views on stories and social issues by sending an SMS to the Rek Jou Bek (Have your own opinion) feature. The Daily Voice has since been sold for R4.00 in Cape Town and surrounds, while its Afrikaans edition was distributed on the West Coast, in the Winelands, the Overberg and even as far as Oudtshoorn. The Afrikaans edition of the Daily Voice was discontinued in June 2013. Page 3 controversy Page 3 of the Daily Voice used to depict a naked woman, which caused quite a stir. Many people saw the publication was defining women as sex symbols and this caused complaints and disapproving comments. In response to this, the chief executive, Tony Howard, of the paper's publishing house, Independent Newspapers, said that sex would be a key element, as with all tabloids, but it would complement rather than dominate other key selling parts. The nude Page 3 girl was dropped from the paper in 2010, and has been replaced by celebrity news. Team of journalists The former executive editor of the Daily Voice was Karl Brophy. Brophy had been a spin doctor for the Irish Government and worked for the Daily Mirror in London, the Irish Examiner, and the Irish Independent. Brophy handed over to Elliott Sylvester in 2008. In 2011, the Irishman Shane Doran became editor. Doran was part of the Irish team sent to South Africa to oversee the Irish group's newspaper assets. In July 2013, Doran stepped down and returned to Ireland after Independent Newspapers was sold to Sekunjalo Investments. The Daily Voice chief sub-editor Taariq Halim was appointed acting editor, and in 2015 officially appointed as the new editor. ;Editorial *Taariq Halim (Editor) *Kim Kay (Online Editor) *Mandy King (Deputy Editor) *Warda Salvester (News Editor) ;Journalists *Genevieve Serra *Saafia February *Robin Lee Francke *Monique Duval *Venecia Valentine *Solly Lottering (Freelance) ;Sport *Dudley Carstens (Sport Editor) *Matthew Marcus *Travis Arendse ;Columnists *Taariq Halim *Robert Jean-Jacques *Bobby Brown *Waseef Piekaan *Nick Feinberg *Dudley Carstens *Matthew Marcus *Julia Stuart *Megan Baadtjies *Saafia February Distribution areas { class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" style=\\"text-align:center; width:400px; height:150px;\\" +Distribution  align=\\"center\\" style=\\"background:#f0f0f0;\\"  align=\\"center\\" style=\\"background:#f0f0f0;\\"2008  align=\\"center\\" style=\\"background:#f0f0f0;\\"2013 - ! scope=\\"row\\" Eastern Cape  Y  Y - ! scope=\\"row\\" Free State   - ! scope=\\"row\\" Gauteng   - ! scope=\\"row\\" Kwa-Zulu Natal   - ! scope=\\"row\\" Limpopo   - ! scope=\\"row\\" Mpumalanga   - ! scope=\\"row\\" North West   - ! scope=\\"row\\" Northern Cape   - ! scope=\\"row\\" Western Cape  Y  Y } Readership figures { class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" style=\\"text-align:center; width:400px; height:100px;\\" +Estimated ReadershipSAARF AMPS (Previous Presentations)SAARF AMPS (Industry Presentations)  align=\\"center\\" style=\\"background:#f0f0f0;\\"  align=\\"center\\" style=\\"background:#f0f0f0;\\"AIR - ! scope=\\"row\\" Jan 2012 – Dec 2012  463 000 - ! scope=\\"row\\" Jul 2011 – Jun 2012  493 000 - ! scope=\\"row\\" Dec 2014  516 000 (AMPS) } See also * List of newspapers in South Africa * Die Son, a similar newspaper, also based in Cape Town  References   External links  * Independent Newspapers Cape - Daily Voice * SAARF Website Daily newspapers published in South Africa Publications established in 2005 Mass media in Cape Town 2005 establishments in South Africa ","title":"Daily Voice (South African newspaper)"},{"id":"31495491","text":"Albert Montañés was the defending champion, but chose to compete in the Serbia Open instead.

As was traditional for Spanish ships not named after a saint, its second, dedicatory name (avocacion) was San Pedro Apóstol. She underwent rebuilding at Cartagena from 1803 to 1805, emerging as a three-decked ship with 100 guns. She then fought at the Battle of Trafalgar during the Napoleonic Wars and was dismasted as a result of damage sustained in the battle. When she sortied after Trafalgar in order to recover prizes, the warship was captured by . Subsequently, she ran aground and was wrecked in a storm. Her broken hull was set ablaze and destroyed by British sailors on 31 October. Service =Early= Construction on Rayo started in 1747 in Havana, Cuba, alongside her sister ship Fénix and was launched in the summer of 1749. She was commissioned in January 1751, but was unable to leave port for the lack of crew. It took another year to find the enough men to sail her. Rayo left Havana for Cádiz with a minimal complement of 453, accompanied by the ships Princesa, Infante and and carrying a cargo of sugar and timber. She remained in Cadiz for further outfits. In 1765, under the command of Captain Don José de Rojas Recaño, Rayo was assigned to the fleet under the command of Admiral Don Juan José de Navarro Viana y Búfalo, the 1st Marqués de la Victoria. The fleet was made up of Rayo, Arrogante, Triunfante, Atlante, Galicia, Princesa, Guerrero , Velasco, Poderoso, two chambequines and five minor vessels. The fleet sailed from Cádiz on 17 May. After briefly stopping at Cartagena, it sailed on to Genoa, arriving on 17 July to drop off the infanta Doña Luisa María Teresa de Parma, daughter of Felipe I de Parma and pick up the Princess Maria Luisa of Spain, daughter of King Carlos III. The fleet returned to Cartagena on 11 August where it dropped off the infanta Doña Luisa María Teresa de Parma and the Marques of la Victoria, Juan José de Navarro Viana y Búfalo. Command was then handed over to Admiral Don Luis de Córdova y Córdova. A smaller fleet was formed, sailing from Cartagena on 23 August, consisting of Rayo, Princesa and Guerrero which was tasked with escorting two tartanes and a saetía back to Cádiz. In 1769, Rayo was disarmed and stationed at Cádiz under the command of Captain Don Pedro Moyano who was charged with the ship's preservation. Between February and April 1769, the ship was careened and refitted =Rebuild= In 1803 Rayo was taken into Cartagena Dockyard where she underwent rebuilding by Honorato Bouyon, emerging with a complete third deck linking her quarterdeck and forecastle, and consequently carrying an enhanced ordnance of 100 guns. =Trafalgar= A stamp depicting Rayo Rayo was dismasted as a result of damage sustained in the battle. A few days later, Rayo went to sea in an attempt to recapture prizes taken by the British. During this effort, she was captured by .

He previously served as the Chief of Cabinet Secretariat of the Government of Mongolia (2017-2019), Minister for Foreign Affairs (2009-2012) and Deputy Minister of Food and Agriculture (2003-2004). He was first elected to State Great Khural in June 2004, thus starting his service as lawmaker. Altogether, he served three terms as a Member of Parliament in 2004-2008, 2008-2012, and 2016-2020.  Biography  = Early career = Zandanshatar’s early career started as Lecturer in the College of trade and industry (1992-1995), after which he worked at the Agricultural Bank of Mongolia, progressively on different positions as Economist, Restructuring manager, Director of Forex department, Director of Loan and Monetary Policy department (1995-1998). Then he was appointed as the member of Receivership Team by the Central Bank of Mongolia at Agricultural Bank and later, after its restructuring, was promoted to Deputy Director of the bank (1998-2003). As a result of restructuring and reorganization the bank was recapitalized and successfully privatized in 2003. = Statesman =  Deputy Minister of food and agriculture (2003-2004)  The agricultural sector of the country was in serious crisis, especially the state of crop farming and flour production were in despair. Zandanshatar actively worked to mobilize state support and attract foreign aid to the sector. His Ministry’s team drafted state policy on farming and agriculture which was later adopted by Parliament. This work laid the foundation for “Atar III” campaign work that revived wheat and crop farming in Mongolia.  Minister of Foreign Affairs (2009-2012)  During his tenure, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been tasked to prioritize economic relations in foreign affairs. Subsequently, the country renewed its Foreign Policy vision in 2011, for the first time after 17 years. Also, in 2011-2013 Mongolia chaired the Community of Democracies. As Minister, his schedule comprised official visits to almost 20 countries such as U.S.A., Japan, P.R. of China, South Korea, Italy, Germany, etc. He also started work to upgrade Mongolian-Japanese relations from Comprehensive partnership to Strategic partnership. Zandanshatar took a series of measures to improve the ethics, discipline, and responsibility of diplomats at all levels.  Chief of the Cabinet secretariat of the Government of Mongolia (2017-2019)  As Chief of Cabinet Secretariat, Zandanshatar worked tirelessly on government priorities, which were to establish fair, transparent, and accountable structure for public officials and to strengthen the responsibilities and regulations on all levels of government agencies. An updated Law of Public Service was adopted by the Parliament in 2018 to be adhered to starting from 2019. He summarized all development policies and resolutions issued until that time into the “Three pillars development policy” encompassing areas of public service reform, social reform, and economic reform.

Chairman (Speaker) of State Great Khural, the Parliament of Mongolia (2019-2020)  In 2019, his predecessor, Miyeegombyn Enkhbold, was ousted after numerous demonstrations by his political opponents, and Gombojavyn Zandanshatar was proposed and later elected unanimously by the Members of the Parliament as Chairman (Speaker). As Chairman he brought to successful completion the historic Constitutional Amendment process. The current Constitution of Mongolia was adopted in 1992 and since then, changes were necessitated by the socio-economic development of the country. Amendments to the main law were discussed throughout the last three terms of Parliament and Zandanshatar was an active force in the process of studying and preparing draft amendments. An important step in the discussion and drafting of the amendments was made in 2015 by way of introducing deliberative democracy and deliberative polling methods that Zandanshatar studied in depth while he worked as visiting scholar and fellow at Stanford University. He introduced this methodology of enabling citizens’ participation in main political changes and reaching political consensus in Mongolia. Based upon the opinions of the Mongolian people that have been expressed by the deliberative polling process, the Parliament of Mongolia under the chairmanship of Zandanshatar has successfully adopted the Amendments to the Constitution on the 14th of November, 2019. = Education = Zandanshatar graduated from Baikal State University in 1992 (formerly Institute of National Economy in Soviet Union with a diploma of Specialist in Finance.

In 2014–2015 and 2016, Zandanshatar was a visiting scholar at the Center on Democracy, Development, and the Rule of Law at Stanford University in California. He was impressed by the concept of deliberative polling developed by the center's director, James Fishkin, and translated his book on it, When the People Speak, into Mongolian.

Founded around 1530, it is one of the oldest museums in Dresden. It is located in Dresden Castle. The Münzkabinett is one of the three largest numismatic collections in Germany. Its nearly 300,000 objects include coins from most countries of the world from antiquity to present day, historic and modern medallions, medals and insignia, historic bank notes and bonds, minting dies for coins and medals, seals, models, early forms of money, and minting machines and equipment. The Münzkabinett is a Landesmünzkabinett or official state collection, and has claim to any hoards of coins found on Saxon territory. The Münzkabinett is also a center of scholarly research and has a public library of some 30,000 volumes.  History  The Münzkabinett is one of Dresden’s oldest museums, dating back to the time of Duke George the Bearded (1500–1539).Paul Arnold, Führer durch die ständige Ausstellung des Münzkabinetts, 2nd ed. Dresden: Staatliche Kunstsammlungen, 1978 Over the centuries the collection has expanded through the constant acquisition of items by the Electors and Kings of Saxony. At the turn of the 18th century, the Dresden Münzkabinett was already a famous coin collection in Europe. The collection became a universal one during the Baroque period. Beginning in the second half of the 18th century, the Münzkabinett also developed into an important German center of scholarly research. The collection was kept in Dresden Castle until 1743, when it was moved to the Taschenbergpalais. In 1786, it was transferred to the Japanisches Palais by Augustus III, the son of Augustus II the Strong, along with the library and the collection of antiquities. In 1877, the Münzkabinett was moved back to the Dresden Castle. From 1911 until 1945, it was housed in the Chancellery Building, near the Stallhof yard. At the end of the war in 1945, the collection was confiscated by the Red Army and taken to the Soviet Union. It was returned to Dresden in 1958, but without the books and magazines which had also been taken. From 1959 until 2002, a selection of coins and medals was on view in the Albertinum. In the summer of 2002, the Münzkabinett finally moved to its place of origin, the Georgenbau of Dresden Castle. Until the permanent exhibition was installed in June 2015, the museum had been holding a series of temporary exhibitions in the Hausmannsturm (Hausmann Tower).  Exhibition and Library  The Münzkabinett exhibition shows around 3,300 objects, including rare and unique items, which represent a cross-section of the various parts of the collection. They are presented in four chapters (rooms). For research work, the collection has a library of some 30,000 volumes. The library and a study room are open to the public.

Tribe resigned to open his own office, Hipwell worked with Tribe during 1949 to 195- during which time, Tribe went on to become the state's leading specialist in the design of modern pre-school centres, with examples as far afield as Swan Hill and Korumburra. During the mid-1950s, Hipwell opened his own private practice in Russell Street, Melbourne. During this time he was working on residential projects and a number of churches.

Hipwell later formed a partnership with Charles Weight and Peter Mason named Hipwell, Weight & Mason in 1960. In 1963 Peter Mason was killed in a car accident ending the partnership. Hipwell and Weight began a new partnership with Albert Ross becoming Hipwell, Weight and Ross until Charles Weight died in 19- from Hodgkin's disease. From there Hipwell and Ross disbanded and Hipwell went on to work for the Department of works for the Victorian Federal Government. In this position, Hipwell worked on the Papua New Guinea Army Expansion Program, and the Bouganville Hospital; as well as the Darwin Gaol with prestigious architect Alfred Dalton. In the Late 1960s, Hipwell resigned from his position with the Department of Works. = Later career = Hipwell was the only non-potter founding member of Potters Cottage a noteworthy organisation based in Warrandyte. This experience, travel & idealism helped to lead to a new career path. They built up 'Betty Hipwell Cottage Industries' importing & wholesaling handmade goods from Developing countries. This spanned 1968–1989. = Hipwell Residence = John Hipwell designed and made his family residence off Research Road in Warrandyte. Unfortunately, the original house, which was published as the cover story in Home Beautiful (October issue 1954) burnt down in a bushfire which ran through Warrandyte and surrounding areas in 1962. The original house burnt down due largely to the entire northern façade being completely glazed and the building's structure being timber. This led Hipwell to design his new house, built in 1963, with bushfires in mind. He used non-combustible materials and an alignment which encouraged the fires to pass over the structure rather than attack and destroy the new house. New Hipwell residence Research Rd Warrandyte.  Later life  In December 1995 John and Elizabeth Hipwell moved to an apartment in Southbank, Victoria and remained there until John's death. Hipwell became very committed to helping architectural students often allowing interviews and photos. He also maintained an extensive collection of puppets which he had been interested in since childhood. Hipwell also had an interest in Electronic music, developing a number of scores and operas.

A bonus is awarded if one party wins the first seven tricks, or even all tricks. The game is played by four players in two teams, but there are also adaptations for two or three players. Derived games have removed the special role of eldest hand or have added features such as the 2 of hearts as the highest trump (satat), the need to win two consecutive tricks in order to pick up tricks (double sar), or counting tens rather than tricks (dehla pakad). The game appears to originate from Iran. In the Indian subcontinent, it is sometimes spelled Coat Peace, Kot Pees, Chokri, Chakri, Rung or Rang. Alternative names include Seven Hands (Iran), t'rup Chaal, and Hok (Israel). In the Dutch-speaking world, a similar game (and likely derivative) is known as Troefcall (Suriname and the Netherlands). In English the game is sometimes referred to simply as Trumps. As Satat, it is the most popular card game of Mauritius. Basic rules The game is played with a full standard deck of 52 cards by four players in fixed partnerships, sitting crosswise. Cards are dealt in batches of 5–3–3–2 or 5–4–4 ...Troefcallspelregels en bepalingen van de Troefcall Sport Bond Nederland . The player who sits after the dealer in the direction of play (which is typically counter-clockwise) is known as trump-caller. Having received the first five cards, this player announces the trump suit (usually called rang of the game - \\"rang\\" meaning \\"color\\" in Persian). The other players are not allowed to look at their cards before the trump suit has been announced. The trump-caller leads to the first trick. In trick-play the normal whist rules apply: Players must follow suit if possible, and the highest trump, or the highest card of the suit led, takes the trick. To choose the highest card, the cards must be 10 and below. The winner of a trick leads to the next trick. The party that wins seven or more tricks wins the handIn Indian English, the card term hand can refer to a trick. However, in this article the term is used with its normal meaning and refers to the set of cards which a player is dealt at the beginning of a game round, as well as to the entire game round played with those cards. and will usually stop the game at this point. Winning seven tricks in one go is a special achievement known as kot or kap. Player have to call first for Continuing afterwards and winning all tricks is a rare achievement known as a bavney or baunie. The Under-ten rule, if the trump-caller not holding any face card may call for re-deal. The first trump-caller (and by implication the first dealer) is determined at random. The role of the trump-caller only passes on to the next player if the trump-caller's party did not win the hand. No talking/communication between the team members is allowed in this game. If a player talks to his teammate then that suite belongs to opponent. There is a variation played only in North India, specially Delhi, where the only way one team member can communicate with the other, is by tapping the table (or any surface) called a 'thaap' intended to indicate to the team member to repeat the colour just played. This variation should be clarified before starting the game. Scoring In a simple scoring variant used in Iran, the winning party scores 1 point if the other team also won a trick, or 2 points for kot, or 3 points for hâkem koti (also known as 'gès kot' in kashmiri), i.e. a kot achieved by the opponents of trump-caller. A scoring variant used in the Netherlands assigns 2 points to a simple win, 5 points to a kap and 15 points to a baunie. To score the 5 points for kap, the player who wins the seventh trick (but not his or her partner) must stop the game at that point. If a party goes for baunie but loses a later trick, then it is only a single win of 2 points. A scoring variant popular in India and Pakistan counts kots. Winning seven consecutive hands (none of which is a kot) is equivalent to a kot. A single bavney counts as 52 kots. Each time the trump-caller's party scores a kot, the trump-caller's partner becomes trump-caller. Minor variations and common games of Rang Sometimes the direction of play is clockwise.. Instead of fixed partnerships, the partnerships may also be determined randomly. In this case the seating arrangement may have to be adjusted so that the players sit crosswise. After all cards have been dealt, it may happen that trump-caller does not hold a single court card. In this case trump-caller may be allowed to announce a redeal. In another variation, trump-caller may call for a redeal if there is not court card among his or her first five cards, but may not do so more than twice in a row. Trump-caller's partner may also be allowed to announce that they do not hold a trump and suggest a redeal. The redeal only happens if trump-caller agrees. Instead of making trumps, the trump-caller may be allowed to opt for a different procedure. In this case, trump-caller or dealer will turn up one of the remaining eight cards dealt to trump-caller for trumps, without looking at it first. A party that fails to stop the play of the hand after winning the first seven tricks, but does not win all tricks, may score only a simple win of the hand rather than a kot. In this case, only the player who wins the seventh trick may have the right to stop the hand. The person showing his trumps should have the greatest card of Rang to win the trick. In Pakistan and India, Rang is played with a lot of variations, all of them are based on rang, but categorized from simple to complex in the following order: =Single Sar= Single Sar is the easiest game of the Rang. Basic rules of the Rang are applied to this game as well, i.e., 52 cards deck, four players in fixed partnership, etc. (Only beginners play this). The cards are dealt in batches of 5-4-4, the trump-caller announces the Rang (trump suit) and starts the game with first trick. All of the players have to follow the suit (if possible), one with the highest-ranked card takes the trick (One trick is called one sar, ()). If any of the player does not have the suit of the trick, he can play card from trump-suit (rang), often referred to as kaat lagana (). This word kaat lagana is Urdu and/or Hindi translation of cutting something, which herein implies cutting of running trick. The player/team with the highest Kaat takes the trick. At the end, the team with more winning tricks wins the game. If trump-caller's team remains the winner, the same dealer deals the cards again. On the other hand, if the dealing team takes more tricks, the deal is forwarded to the next player (counter clock-wise), that is, the trump-caller in previous game. =Double Sar= Double sar or double siri, also referred to as double rang or double rung, is the most commonly played game in India and Pakistan. It is a variant of Single Sar in which tricks are not automatically collected by their winner's party. Instead they form a heap in the middle between the players until one player (not one partnership) wins two consecutive tricks, thereby winning the entire heap for his or her partnership. Basic rules of the Rang are applied to Double Sar as well. The winner of the last trick always picks up whatever remains in the heap at that point. Usually, the first collection of heap requires three tricks or five tricks must have been played already. Some variations of double sar forbid collecting the heap when a certain common game situation occurs, such as winning the first two tricks or winning two consecutive tricks with aces. Scoring is by kots and grand-kots. In this game a kot is defined as collecting all tricks by trump-caller team, which unlike bavney in standard court piece is realistically achievable. A grand-kot or goon-kot is defined as collection of all tricks (sars, ()) by the dealing team. A goon-kot counts triple (or ten-fold). The decision of dealer for the first time is chosen randomly or toss using the deck. For every next turn, the result of the current game decides the dealer as well. In case of kot the next dealer is the opposite player of losing team. In case of grand-kot, the next dealer is the trump-caller. In all other cases, the team with less tricks (sars) deals the cards. The same player deals if the dealing team remains unable to win seven or more sars. The dealing is termed as pees, and considered to be hard work. Winning seven hands in a row by collecting the majority of tricks is sometimes equivalent to a kot. The game is popular in India and Pakistan. Sar literally means head, but in this context refers to a trick. =Dummy Rang= Dummy Rang, mostly referred to as Dummy only, is a variant of Double Sir, which is played between three players instead of four as in common rang games. The fourth player is a dummy player, that is why this game is termed as Dummy. In every game, the dummy player is set to be the partner of one player, rotated counter clock-wise. The cards of the fourth player are placed face-up position, and partner of the dummy player is responsible of dummy's turn. Scoring is based on number of sars (tricks), it is counted for each individual player. One match ends when score reaches to 104. =Dab Rang= Dab Rang is the most complex, logical and interesting game of the rang. Unlike 'khula rung' (open rung), each player announces the number of 'sars' (rounds) he would pick or win, the trump or 'rung' suit is not revealed rather a card from that suit is placed face down somewhere by the player who announces the highest number of sars, the rest of the game is the same except no one wins a sar unless the trump suit is revealed by the elimination of a suit from the other team's hand and their insisting upon that they want to 'kat lagana' or cut the ongoing round and thus must know the trump suit. Thus the primary objective of the other team is to reveal the trump suite asap and that of the boss team is to keep it concealed. If the number of sars previously declared is picked up, the game is won. Some players like to allow the rule of using two aces at same time to get the declared number of \\"Sars\\". Closely related games =Satat= Satat, the most popular game of Mauritius, differs from court piece only in the special role assigned to the 2 of hearts and the existence of a system of signals for the exchange of information between partners. In this game the 2 of hearts is the highest trump. It may always be used to trump a trick, even if its owner still holds cards of the suit led. A player who holds the 2 of hearts but no other trumps need not follow suit when trumps is led. There is no fixed scoring system. Once all cards have been dealt again after a kot, each of the losing partners must pass a trump (or if they do not hold a trump their highest-ranking card) to their right neighbour, who simultaneously passes them an unwanted card. However, the 2 of hearts need not be passed, and neither of the players who won the kot may use this opportunity to rid themselves entirely of a plain suit. The same principle applies after a bavney, except that in that case each player passes on two cards. Trup kasiet Trup kasiet is a satat variant in which the trump- caller makes trumps secretly by putting a card face down. Until it is clear which suit is trumps, trump-caller must announce after each trick who won it. When the 2 of hearts is played before the trump suit is known, players may play any card. Since kot and bavney are more common in this variant, no cards are passed in the following hand. Dehla Pakad or Mindi Dehla pakad is double sar with the further variation that tens are counted instead of tricks. A kot is achieved when a party wins all four tens in tricks or if it wins seven consecutive hands by collecting three tens in each. If a team takes all 4 tens in a hand, they win one Kot. The turn to deal passes to the right if the dealing team won and to the dealer's partner if the non-dealing team won. If non dealer's team takes 1, 2 or 3 tens, they win the hand and the same dealer deals again. If the dealer's team took 4 tens, they win the hand and the turn to deal passes to the right and the kot is removed. . Court piece variants with no trump-caller Double sar and dehla pakad have developed variants which lack the special role of the trump-caller – otherwise a defining feature of court piece and its variants. The game begins without trumps, and the first player who cannot follow suit determines the trump suit with the card he or she plays. The heap cannot be picked up before the trump suit has been determined. In a variant described for dehla pakad, trick-play begins after the first five cards have been dealt. The first player who cannot follow suit determines the trump suit with the card played. This is the earliest chance to pick up the heap. At this point the remaining cards are dealt, potentially making it unverifiable that the player was in fact unable to follow suit. Therefore, this game requires honest players. In the event that all players were able to follow suit in the first five tricks, a random card is drawn from the heap. In be-ranga double sar, the game begins after all cards have been dealt. The heap cannot be picked up before the subsequent trick after the trump suit has been determined. Adaptations for fewer than four players In Iran, two- and three-player variants of this popular game are documented. For the three-player game, one of the 2s is removed, resulting in a pack of 51 cards. The cards are dealt in batches of 5–4–4–4. A round is stopped as soon as one player has won more tricks than any of the opponents would have if they won all the remaining tricks. (For example, the game is over at 7–4–4 tricks, but not at 8–3–1.) If a player wins the first 7 tricks, the round is also stopped and the player wins 2 points (eldest hand) or 3 points (opposing player). In the two-player game, only 5 cards are dealt to each player. After eldest hand has declared trumps, each player discards 3 cards face down. Players then alternate drawing single cards from the stock until they have 13 cards each. Any card drawn may be discarded face down and replaced by the next card from the stock, which must then be kept. Terminology ;rang, rung, hokm, troef :Trumps.. ;trump-caller, caller, hâkem :Eldest hand, i.e. the player who sits after the dealer and leads to the first trick.

Geographical distribution and naming The game appears to originate in Iran, India and Pakistan,Geschiedenis troefcall . where it is known under several names., . Court, coat or kot apparently stands for the achievement in the game, and pees is a Hindi word for to deal. In the alternative name seven hands, hands is Indian English for tricks. The game is popular amongst the Gujarati diaspora, particularly in East Africa, the UK and Canada who refer to the game as chokri or chakri (of which a six player variation is also played). Immigrants from the Indian subcontinent brought the game to Suriname and Guyana, where it is known as troefcall (\\"trumps call\\", a mixture of Dutch and English) and t'rup chaal... From Suriname it found its way to the Netherlands. Under the name hokm (, trumps) it is very popular in Iran.. Satat is the most popular game in Mauritius, a group of islands whose majority population is of Indian descent. The name of the game is derived from saat hant, Hindi for seven hands.

It is approximately 18 kilometres long. Course The river rises in the forest of Mynydd Margam, not far west of Maesteg, in close proximity to the River Afan and the Llynfi River. From here it flows south, and turns west near the town of Pyle, through the area known as the M4 Corridor. The river is at the northern edge of the Kenfig National Nature Reserve, a designated Site of Special Scientific Interest. It also forms the boundary of the Neath Port Talbot and Bridgend districts for much of its course, before running into the sea at Margam Sands, close to Margam Moors. It flows through an area steeped in folklore and local legend, much of it tied in with the lost towns beneath the shifting sands of Kenfig Burrows. Although the river has few significant tributaries, it picks up a few small streams on its course. Major tributaries include the Nant Iorwaeth-goch, which joins the river as it turns westward north of Kenfig Hill, the Afon Fach, a stream which flows through North Cornelly and Pyle, and the Coal Brook, which rises in Margam Park. Kenfig National Nature Reserve The final stretch of the River Kenfig at Kenfig Sands is at the northern boundary of the Kenfig Nature Reserve. This reserve contains Kenfig Pool, the largest lake in South Wales, and Kenfig Burrows, its largest sand dune system. The river does not actually flow through the village of Kenfig itself. It runs about a mile to the north; however, it flows past the remains of Kenfig castle, which is at the original site of the village. This site was abandoned in the 13th century when the sand dunes, shifted by wild storms, began to bury parts of the village. Only the tower of Kenfig Castle is now visible. Industry The river is south of the vast industrial complex of Port Talbot and Margam, which includes the Port Talbot Steelworks. In 1968 BorgWarner opened a plant at Kenfig for the manufacture of automatic transmissions. In January 1976 the plant celebrated the completion of its two millionth gearbox, which was 'presented' to A B Volvo. At that time a press release stated that Borg- Warner's UK plants at Letchworth and at Kenfig were producing transmissions for use in more than fifty different car models, and that more than half the gearboxes produced were exported outside the UK. In 2001, the factory faced the threat of closure but was saved by a new contract from Korean car company Kia. In December 2008, Borg-Warner announced that the plant would finally close by mid 2010 with the loss of all 110 jobs at the site; a statement from the company blamed the economic downturn for the decision.

When it was deactivated in 1990 it was donated to the Townsville Maritime Museum and it is now on display near the museum. It is the only survivor of a series of twenty automatic lighthouses installed in Queensland during the \\"Golden Age of Australian Lighthouses\\" from 1913 to the early 1920s. History With the Federation of Australia in 1901, responsibility over coastal lighthouses was to be transferred to the commonwealth. In 1911, the Lighthouses Act was passed, giving the Commonwealth the power to take responsibility over navigational aids as required. The actual transfer of responsibility took place with the formation of the Commonwealth Lighthouse Service (CLS) on 1 July 1915, during a period that was termed \\"the Golden Age of Australian lighthouses\\", from 1913 to the early 1920s. reprinted in The CLS took over a group of 104 manned and 18 unmanned lighthouses. Lighting the northern Inside Passage, the shipping route inside the Great Barrier Reef, was one of the urgent tasks taken by the CLS. At the time, only four lights were present between the Torres Strait and Cooktown, namely Grassy Hill Light, Pipon Island Light, Goods Island Light and Booby Island Light. The CLS tackled this task with the installation of twenty new fully automatic unattended lights, a decision motivated by the shortage of manpower, materials and funding caused by World War I. The structures were almost identical, differing mainly in height. The structures were mostly installed on coral reefs or sandbars, with little natural support. The foundation was usually a flat concrete base with concrete piers supporting the structure. The structure was a simple four-legged steel frame, manufactured in Brisbane, topped with simple lantern with a small balcony. The apparatus was a fully automatic Dalén light consisting of a carbide lamp feeding on compressed acetylene gas, controlled by a sun valve. Wharton Reef Light, established 1915, was one of the first such lights to be constructed. The lighthouse was located on Wharton Reef (then called Dhu Reef) in Princess Charlotte Bay, west of Pipon Island, about north of Cairns, replacing an earlier beacon on the reef. It was originally about high. The construction of Wharton Reef Light was especially difficult due to bad weather. Instability of the surface required deep excavation of the foundations. Wharton Reef Light was described in 1959 as showing a white flash every three seconds. The light had an intensity of 1,500 cd and was visible for . The light was displayed at an elevation of . as quoted in Lack, 1959. Fresnel lens from Wharton Reef Light on the bottom row, at Townsville Maritime Museum The lighthouse operated until 1990, when the structure was replaced by a fibreglass hut and the light was replaced by an automatic ML-300 beacon. By then it was the last of its kind to remain operative. The tower was donated by the federal Department of Transport to the Townsville Maritime Museum. It was dismantled and shipped to Townsville. In 1996 it was erected in the middle of a traffic turnabout near the museum, where it stands on display as of 2011. The Fresnel lens from the light is on display inside the museum, along with other lenses used in the area. It is now the only survivor of the series of twenty lighthouses.

Jharsa was the place of Samru's principal cantonment. Few years before her death Begum Samru claimed the offering to Sitla Mata temple of Gurugram during the Chaitra month and the revenue from the offerings given to the deity for rest of the month was distributed among the prominent Jat zamindars of the area and a total land of 1600 bigha was given to her priest named Rudaa Pandit who later developed Village Silokhra on that land.

It analyzes programs written in the C programming language and outputs an exhaustive list of possible runtime errors and assertion violations. The defect classes covered include divisions by zero, buffer overflows, dereferences of null or dangling pointers, data races, deadlocks, etc. Astrée includes a static taint checker and helps finding cybersecurity vulnerabilities, such as Spectre. The tool is tailored towards safety-critical embedded code: specific analysis techniques are used for common control theory constructs (finite state machines, digital filters, rate limiters...) and floating-point numbers. Concurrent code is analyzed with a sound interleaving semantics that is aware of the concurrent threads of execution, their priorities and synchronization mechanisms. Astrée supports the ARINC 653, OSEK and AUTOSAR execution models and can be adapted to additional OS specifications. On multi-core processors the placement of threads to cores, and the usage of mutex locks and spinlocks are taken into account. Astrée was developed in Patrick Cousot's group at École Normale Supérieure, a joint group with CNRS, and is marketed by AbsInt GmbH.

Early life Strudwick attended St Saviour's Grammar School in Southwark. Disliking the idea of a business career, he took classes at the Royal Academy Schools in South Kensington, but was not regarded as a promising student. Painting In the 1860s he was encouraged by a visitor, the Scottish genre painter, John Pettie, whose style he subsequently emulated. His depiction of the ballad of 'Auld Robin Gray', which was exhibited at the Royal Society of British Artists in 1873, is an example of this period. His art style, however, developed in a new direction in the 1870s when he worked first as studio assistant to his uncle Spencer Stanhope and then to Edward Burne-Jones. In keeping with artists in his circle, he exhibited at the Grosvenor and New Galleries. Strudwick's studio was in Hammersmith, close to that of Burne-Jones and Thomas Matthews Rooke, who had also been an assistant to Burne-Jones. He married Harriet Reed and had a single daughter, Ethel (1880–1954), who later became High Mistress of St Paul's Girls' School from 1927 to 1948, and was appointed a CBE. His initial success as a painter came to an end when wealthy and influential patrons such as the Liverpool shipowners William Imrie and George Holt withdrew their support. His painting \\"When Sorrow comes in Summer Days, Roses Bloom in Vain\\" was left half finished in protest at the seemingly orchestrated collapse of his career. Style Strudwick's paintings were done in a blend of Renaissance and medieval styles, with meticulous attention to detail, especially in his treatment of draperies and accessories, and leading to a very small output. Some thirty of his paintings depict legendary and symbolic subjects, sometimes employing a lapidary technique from the Italian quattrocento. He employed rich, deep colours, faces clearly inspired by Burne-Jones and sumptuous drapery. His work was regularly slated by Frederic George Stephens, a failed painter become critic for the Athenaeum, who could find little positive to say. Death The Times obituary described him as 'a beautiful old man... (and) a charming personality, exceedingly kind to young artists'. Notable works One of Strudwick's works, \\"Thy Music, faintly falling, dies away, Thy dear eyes dream that Love will live for aye\\" has in recent times had two celebrated owners - writer and broadcaster Sir Tim Rice in the 1970s, and in 1987, P.C. Withers of Reading, a leading authority on Strudwick. It was originally bought from the artist by the shipowner William Imrie of 'Holmstead', Mossley Hill in Liverpool. The picture's title is from a couplet by G.F. Bodley (1827–1907), the eminent architect who was closely associated with the later Pre-Raphaelite movement.

He was the longest-serving governor of the colony, with four successive terms in office.  Early life and career  Murray MacLehose was born in Glasgow, Scotland in October 1917 as the second child of Hamish Alexander MacLehose and Margaret Bruce Black. He attended Rugby School in 1931 and Balliol College, Oxford. During World War II, while under the cover of being the British vice-consul, MacLehosep. 150 The Man Who Loved China by Simon Winchester, 2008 trained Chinese guerrillas to operate behind Japanese lines to carry out sabotage. MacLehose was principal private secretary to Foreign Secretary George Brown in the late 1960s. His career almost stalled when he left a copy of a confidential telegram in a bank in 1967. The document, from British Prime Minister Harold Wilson to US President Lyndon B. Johnson concerning the Vietnam War, was turned in by another British diplomat who found it. Wilson and Brown prevented an investigation of this security breach, because they appreciated MacLehose's ability, thus saving his career.Peter Graff, Mislaid MacLehose cable reveals UK efforts to end Vietnam War , The Standard, 2 November 2007 MacLehose was appointed the British Ambassador to South Vietnam in 1967. Before being appointed as Governor of Hong Kong in 1971, he served in the British Embassy in Beijing and as Ambassador to Denmark.  Governor of Hong Kong  MacLehose became Governor of Hong Kong in November 1971, holding this position until May 1982, making him Hong Kong's longest-serving governor; his 10 years and 6 months in office exceeding Sir Alexander Grantham's previous record by one month. He was widely and affectionately known as \\"Jock the Sock\\", in reference both to his Scottish heritage and to his name, 'hose' being a word meaning sock or stocking. MacLehose stood well over six feet tall. He avoided wearing his gubernatorial uniform, as he felt very ill at ease in it. A diplomat with a British Labour Party background,The East Asian welfare model: welfare Orientalism and the state by Roger Goodman, Gordon White, and Huck-ju Kwon MacLehose introduced a wide range of reforms during his time in office that laid the foundation of modern Hong Kong as a cohesive, self-aware society. He had Chinese recognised as an official language for communication, alongside English. He greatly expanded welfare and set up a massive public housing programme. Under massive public pressure, he created the ICAC to root out corruption. By establishing the District Boards, he greatly improved government accountability.District Administration Hong Kong Government He oversaw the construction of the Mass Transit Railway, Hong Kong's transportation backbone, and other major infrastructure projects. On his watch, community and arts facilities were expanded, and public campaigns, such as against litter and violent crime, were introduced. These changes required approval from the UK Government Treasury for increased expenditure, and it was against some opposition that, in his first two years in office, Hong Kong government expenditure grew by over 50%. MacLehose was convinced that China would eventually reclaim Hong Kong and opposed any significant move towards constitutional democracy in Hong Kong. = Other notable policies = Other major policies introduced during the MacLehose era included: * The introduction of 9 years of compulsory education.Social policy reform in Hong Kong and Shanghai: a tale of two cities by Linda Wong, Lynn T.

The talks, although inconclusive at the time, eventually involved top British Government officials and paved the way for the handover of the Hong Kong in its entirety, including those parts ceded to the UK in perpetuity, to the People's Republic of China on 1 July 1997.  Post-governorship and later life  After his governorship ended in 1982, MacLehose was made a life peer as Baron MacLehose of Beoch, of Maybole in the District of Kyle and Carrick and of Victoria in Hong Kong, later that year.

He has been described as \\"the principal architect of South Africa's first full-fledged ideology of African nationalism.\\". Lembede had a strong influence on Nelson Mandela,. Walter Sisulu and Oliver Tambo. Lembede was regarded as the progenitor of the \\"Programme of Action\\" that was adopted as a guiding document by the 1949 meeting of the African National Congress. He died in 1947, aged 33. Early life Anton Muziwakhe Lembede was born on 21 January 1914 on the farm of Frank Fell in Eston near Pietermaritzburg, KwaZulu Natal, South Africa. Anton was the eldest of seven children born to Mbazwana Martin and Martha Nora MaLuthuli Lembede. His father Mbazwana Martin was a farm labourer and his mother was a teacher. Anton was home-schooled by his mother, who taught him to read and write until grade four level. He was given the name \\"Anton\\" by a priest at Eston. It was only when Anton turned 13 that he started his formal education at the Catholic Inkanyezi School. Education In 1933, Lembede enrolled at Adams College, which at the time, was one of the more prestigious \\"native\\" schools. The school saw students coming from central Africa to enrol. Lembede enrolled for the \\"Native Teachers Higher Primary Certificate\\". As a student he was noted for dedication, his brilliance with languages and his family's obvious poverty. The latter resulted in him being avoided by other students. Lembede's views at the time were more practical than political and he wrote about the need for education and self-reliance. This reflects the traditional view of his school that had been created by John Dube after hearing the ideas of the American Booker Washington. In 1936 after graduation by Adams College, he not only took up teaching posts but he also pursued a Bachelor of Arts degree in his spare time. Lembede majored in Philosophy and Roman Law. Lembede then enrolled at the University of South Africa for a law degree and completed it in 1942. Lembede finally registered for a Master of Arts Degree in Philosophy in 1943. His 1945 thesis was entitled \\"The Conception of God as Expounded by, or as it Emerges from the Writings of Philosophers- from Descartes to the Present Day\\". Career Walter and Albertina Sisulu's wedding. Evelyn Mase is to the left of the groom and Lembede is to the right of the bride. Nelson Mandela is far left. Rosabella Sisulu looks out over the couple. Lembede moved to Johannesburg after finishing his L.L.B and completed his articles at Pixley ka Isaka Seme's law firm. Seme had first proposed the idea of the ANC and he had been an unimpressive president of the organisation.Christopher Saunders, 'Seme, Pixley ka Isaka (1882–1951)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, May 2006 accessed 11 Aug 2013 Seme no longer enjoyed the success of his early career and he looked to Lembede to take over his firm when he retired. Seme briefly practised law for a while. During this time he regularly met with Walter Sisulu, Nelson Mandela and Oliver Tambo (who went on to establish their black South African law firm), discussing how they must win their freedom. In 1944 he attended the wedding of Walter and Albertina Sisulu. Also present was Nelson Mandela and Evelyn Mase. Lembede lived in Orlando in Johannesburg with his intellectual partner A.P. Mda, whom he had met when they were both aspiring teachers. He and Mda would spend their free time holding debating games which stood them in both stead. Lembede read widely and he would quote fascist leaders until Mda pointed out the racist policies that they espoused. ANCYL Lembede was the principal thinker behind launching the African National Congress Youth League.Anton Lembede, pzacad.pitzer.edu. Retrieved 3 August 2013 So in 1943 he led Nelson Mandela, Oliver Tambo, Walter Sisulu, Jordan Ngubane, Ellen Kuzwayo, Albertina Sisulu, Lembede's friend A.P. Mda, Dan Tloome, and David Bopape to become the first elected general president of the ANC Youth League on 10 September 1944. The league wanted to reform the ANC, which they described as \\"a body of gentlemen with clean hands\\".. Lembede spent a lot of his time creating the organisation's Manifesto whilst also being elected to be the ANC's secretary in the Transvaal. The following year Lembede, Tambo and Sisulu went on the attack to defend their ideas of African nationalism and they almost succeeded in getting the communists thrown out of the congress in the Transvaal. Possibly as a result both the ANC's National Executive seconded him to help them. Lembede died suddenly in 1947. His cause of death was not announced but his family later said it was cardiac failure associated with a blocked intestine. He had intestinal problems during the 1940s and he had abdominal surgery in both 1940 and 1941. Lembede had a funeral with many notable attendees. Mda took over the presidency on a temporary basis after Lembede died, but he was elected to the position in time. Legacy After the publication of Lembede's collected works, one reviewer commented that the South African activist's \\"ideas achieved canonical status in 1978 with the publication of Gail Gerhart's Black Power in South Africa […] which accorded recognition to Lembede as a pioneering figure in an intellectual lineage that was later embodied in Robert Sobukwe and Steve Biko.\\". Be that as it may, Lembede's legacy is probably the \\"Youth League manifesto\\" policy document that he, Mda, and Ngubane worked on for the Youth League. This document challenged the ANC to be more active and to set aside gentle debate. This document was to go on to be a leading policy of the ANC. The document recognized that race was an issue and that Africans needed to seize their inheritance. Lembede was inflexible and rejected the idea of welcoming sympathetic white supporters. He realised that the collaboration and cooperation with the patronising white leaders had only resulted in further discriminatory treatment. The gentle approach of ANC leaders such as AP Xuma was not going to establish a major change in their lifetime. Lembede wanted African Nationalism. He had realized that history had been distorted by the \\"white leaders\\" and that you did not need to be white to lead. Lembede said \\"under the banner of Congress, African youth will triumphantly march to freedom – freedom within our lifetime\\". Nelson Mandela wrote, \\"One night in 1943 I met Anton Lembede, who held master of arts and bachelor of law degrees, and A.P. Mda. From the moment I heard Lembede speak, I knew I was seeing a magnetic personality who thought in original and often startling ways.\\". Mda said Lembede gave a \\"clear and pointed expression to the vaguely felt ideas of the age.\\" Mandela later wrote that \\"Lembede's views struck a chord in me. […] I came to see the antidote as militant African nationalism.\\" In 1947 after Lembede's death the \\"Programme of Action\\" was agreed by the ANC under its new more militant president. Lembede was regarded as the architect of this important document. Mda arranged for the document to be adopted with only small changes by the next conference in Port Elizabeth and Oliver Tambo arranged that the new president of the ANC, who would guide the 1949 ANC conference, would adopt the Programme of Action as their guiding document. In 2002 his bones were removed from Johannesburg and flown to Durban where they were reburied on 27 October 2002 at Madundube in Umbumbulu, Durban.

The city lies in the north-western corner of the Bay of Plenty, on the south-eastern edge of Tauranga Harbour. The city extends over an area of , and encompasses the communities of Bethlehem, on the south-western outskirts of the city; Greerton, on the southern outskirts of the city; Matua, west of the central city overlooking Tauranga Harbour; Maungatapu; Mount Maunganui, located north of the central city across the harbour facing the Bay of Plenty; Otūmoetai; Papamoa, Tauranga's largest suburb, located on the Bay of Plenty; Tauranga City; Tauranga South; and Welcome Bay. Tauranga is one of New Zealand's main centres for business, international trade, culture, fashion and horticultural science. The Port of Tauranga is New Zealand's largest port in terms of gross export tonnage and efficiency. Tauranga is one of New Zealand's fastest-growing cities, with a 14 percent increase in population between the 2001 census and the 2006 census, and 11% between the 2006 census and the 2013 census. Due to its rapid population growth, Tauranga has become New Zealand's fifth-largest city, displacing Dunedin and the Napier-Hastings urban areas. History =Settlement= The earliest known settlers were Māori, who arrived in the 13th century at Tauranga in the Tākitimu and the Mātaatua waka. At 9 am on Friday, 23 June 1826, was the first European ship to enter Tauranga Harbour. The Revd. Henry Williams conducted a Christian service at Otamataha Pā. In December 1826 and again in March 1827, the Herald travelled to Tauranga from the Bay of Islands to obtain supplies of potatoes, pigs and flax. In 1835 a Church Missionary Society mission station was established at Tauranga by William Wade. Rev. Alfred N. Brown arrived at the CMS mission station in 1838. John Morgan also visited the mission in 1838. View of waterfront in 1924 Europeans trading in flax were active in the Bay of Plenty during the 1830s; some were transient, others married local women and settled permanently. The first permanent non-Maori trader was James Farrow, who travelled to Tauranga in 1829, obtaining flax fibre for Australian merchants in exchange for muskets and gunpowder. Farrow acquired a land area of on 10 January 1838 at Otūmoetai Pā from the chiefs Tupaea, Tangimoana and Te Omanu, the earliest authenticated land purchase in the Bay of Plenty. In 1840, a Catholic mission station was established. Bishop Pompallier was given land within the palisades of Otūmoetai Pā for a church and a presbytery. The mission station closed in 1863 due to land wars in the Waikato district. =New Zealand Wars–Tauranga Campaign= The Tauranga Campaign took place in and around Tauranga from 21 January to 21 June 1864, during the New Zealand Wars. The Battle of Gate Pa is the best known. The Battle of Gate Pa The battle of Gate Pā was an attack on the well fortified Pā and its Māori defenders on 29 April 1864 by British forces made up of approximately 300 men of the 43rd Regiment and a naval contingent. It was the single most devastating loss of life suffered by the British military in the whole of the New Zealand Wars. The British casualties were 31 dead (including 10 officers), and 80 wounded. The Māori defenders abandoned the Pā during the night with casualties estimated at 25 dead and an unknown number of wounded. Tauranga today Under the Local Government (Tauranga City Council) Order 2003, Tauranga became legally a city for a second time, from 1 March 2004.

It was filmed at Southall Studios, and features Petula Clark singing \\"A Long Way to Go\\", written by Joe Henderson and Leslie Clark (Petula's father). The film was based on a play by Joseph Colton; also starring Pickles and Jenkins, it had run at London's Piccadilly Theatre for 276 performances from June 1952 to February 1953.https://theatricalia.com/play/3xk/the-gay-dog/production/pbj Plot A miner, Jim Gay, owns a greyhound, \\"Raving Beauty\\", which has been very successful in races at the local stadium called Rodney Park. But his bets on the dog are not winning him much money, so Gay hits upon a plan to improve its starting odds so as to win more money. He and his friend Peter (a fellow miner) initially pretend that Raving Beauty is ill, and the rumours soon spread around the local community. However, upon visiting the vicar, Jim and Peter find out that the vicar is looking after his brother's greyhound called Prince of Erin who is due to compete in the same race as Raving Beauty on the Saturday. Peter attempts to find out more about Prince of Erin and forms a relationship with the vicar's daughter Peggy. He eventually finds out that Prince of Erin has good form from Shelbourne Park and his breeding bloodlines relate to Mick the Miller. Jim and Peter then tell the local community that Raving Beauty is fit and well because they know Prince of Erin is most likely to win and want a better starting price. Meanwhile Jim's daughter Sally (Petula Clark) is attending the Women's Institute to avoid Peter who is also her unwanted suitor. There she meets and falls in love with a final year medical student who is lecturing the group on first aid. On race day Jim and Peter bet Prince of Erin at odds of 7-1, whilst the local community (who would normally bet on Raving Beauty) bet on Raving Beauty where the odds are still 1-1. Both greyhounds perform well but Prince of Erin wins. The local community realise that Jim and Peter knew more, which results in Jim getting a black eye. However Jim has won enough money from the bookmakers to take a taxi home, give the vicar a donation for his charities and to pay back four family members their stake money. Meanwhile Peter offers to be the best man at Sally's wedding and goes off with Peggy. The film ends with a Jim and Maggie going on holiday to Blackpool in a new motor car with Jim sitting in the back with Raving Beauty. A sub plot sees Jim's daughter (Sally) and the vicar's son (Leslie) get engaged to be married.

Wilfred Pickles presents an interesting character study of a hard-working miner, whilst retaining his customary mannerisms. Petula Clark gives a sensitive performance.\\" *'Today's Cinema' also wrote in 1954, \\"Pretty Petula Clark is as fresh as ever and gives a well-ironed performance. In Russell Enouch (who later changed his name to William Russell) she has a romantic partner with good looks, modest charm and considerable ability.\\" Scenes The greyhound racing scenes were shot mainly at Belmont Stadium in Durham an independent track (unaffiliated to a governing body). However the final race actually shows the greyhounds racing around two different tracks, Belmont and a much larger unidentified stadium (possibly New Cross). The portrayal of 1950s independent greyhound racing is reasonably accurate.

Its lies right on the edge of the Zugspitzplatt where it drops into the Reintalanger in a location with scenic views and is an important base for hikers who can climb up to it on the normal route from the town of Garmisch-Partenkirchen through the Reintal valley to Germany's highest mountain, the Zugspitze. The Knorr Hut is rated as category I, and belongs to the Munich Section of the German Alpine Club (DAV).  History  left The Knorr Hut was built by 1855 as a small, rude refuge hut, the merchant, Angelo Knorr, contributing \\"a significant sum of money\\" towards it. By 1860 the hut had become run down, because \\"the maintenance of the same had been paid little attention\\". Finally the Munich Section of the newly founded German Alpine Club took over the hut. As well as the section itself, \\"the Royal District Office of Werdenfels, as well as His Royal Highness Prince Otto of Bavaria and Mr Julius Knorr contributed a considerable sum\\" towards its upgrade and extension. On 10 August 1873 In: Mitteilungen des Deutschen und Österreichischen Alpenvereins, Vol. 1/1875, p. 51. (Online at ALO). the work had proceeded sufficiently, that the newly built hut could be handed over to fulfil its purpose. At that time it offered \\"comfortable accommodation\\" for 20 to 25 people (overnighting for 12 people).

From there – a detour to the source of the Partnach is worthwhile – onwards and ca. 700 metres upwards to the Knorr Hut. Duration without stops ca. 6 to 7 hours. * From Ehrwald to the Ehrwalder Alm (1,500 m), this section can also be covered using the gondola lift from Ehrwald. Continues past the Pest Chapel and the Feldern Jöchel (2,041 m) and over the Gatterl (border crossing) and along the Plattsteig trail to the Knorr Hut. Immediately beyond the Gatterl the hut can already be seen on the other side of the Platt, directly under the Brunntalkopf (2,264 m). Duration without stops from the Ehrwalder Alm ca. 2½ hours. * The Knorr Hut is an ideal base for crossing the Jubilee Ridge to the Zugspitze. A marked climbing path with several easy climbs goes up to the Brunntalkopf and over the linking ridge that descends from the Inner Höllentalspitze to the Jubilee Ridge, which is joined at a point between the Inner and Middle Höllentalspitze at 2,650 m. Roughly two to three hours of exposed ridge walking and climbing with splendid views of the Höllental valley to the north, the Zugspitzplatt to the south and the summit of the Zugspitze itself.

This means that biology is a possible factor in political orientation but may also mean that the ideology a person identifies with changes a person's ability to perform certain tasks. Many of the studies linking biology to politics remain controversial and unreplicated, although the overall body of evidence is growing. Studies have found that subjects with conservative political views have larger amygdalae and are more prone to feeling disgust. Liberals have larger volume of grey matter in the anterior cingulate cortex and are better at detecting errors in recurring patterns. Conservatives have a stronger sympathetic nervous system response to threatening images and are more likely to interpret ambiguous facial expressions as threatening. In general, conservatives are more likely to report larger social networks, more happiness and better self-esteem than liberals. Liberals are more likely to report greater emotional distress, relationship dissatisfaction and experiential hardship and are more open to experience and tolerate uncertainty and disorder better. Genetic factors account for at least some of the variation of political views. From the perspective of evolutionary psychology, conflicts regarding redistribution of wealth may have been common in the ancestral environment and humans may have developed psychological mechanisms for judging their own chances of succeeding in such conflicts. These mechanisms affect political views. Brain studies In the 2011 study by neuroscientist Ryota Kanai (n=90 students), the subjects who expressed conservative views (right) tended to have a larger amygdala than those who expressed liberal views (left). A 2011 study by cognitive neuroscientist Ryota Kanai at University College London found structural brain differences between subjects of different political orientation in a convenience sample of students at the same college. The researchers performed MRI scans on the brains of 90 volunteer students who had indicated their political orientation on a five-point scale ranging from \\"very liberal\\" to \\"very conservative\\".Liberal vs. Conservative: Does the Difference Lie in the Brain? – TIME Healthland Students who reported more conservative political views were found to have larger amygdalae, a structure in the temporal lobes whose primary function is in the formation, consolidation and processing of memory, as well as positive and negative conditioning (emotional learning). The amygdala is responsible for important roles in social interaction, such as the recognition of emotional cues in facial expressions and the monitoring of personal space, with larger amygdalae correlating with larger and more complex social networks. It is also postulated to play a role in threat detection, including modulation of fear and aggression to perceived threats.T.L. Brink. (2008) Psychology: A Student Friendly Approach. \\"Unit 4: The Nervous System.\\" pp 61 Conservative students were also found to have greater volume of gray matter in the left insula and the right entorhinal cortex. There is evidence that conservatives are more prone to disgust and one role of the insula is in the modulation of social emotions, such as the feeling of disgust to specific sights, smells and norm violations. Students who reported more liberal political views were found to have a larger volume of grey matter in the anterior cingulate cortex, a structure of the brain associated with emotional awareness and the emotional processing of pain. The anterior cingulate cortex becomes active in situations of uncertainty, and is postulated to play a role in error detection, such as the monitoring and processing of conflicting stimuli or information. The authors concluded that, \\"Although our data do not determine whether these regions play a causal role in the formation of political attitudes, they converge with previous work to suggest a possible link between brain structure and psychological mechanisms that mediate political attitudes.\\" In an interview with LiveScience, Ryota Kanai said, \\"It's very unlikely that actual political orientation is directly encoded in these brain regions\\", and that, \\"more work is needed to determine how these brain structures mediate the formation of political attitude.\\" Kanai and colleagues added that it is necessary to conduct a longitudinal study to determine whether the changes in brain structure that we observed lead to changes in political behavior or whether political attitudes and behavior instead result in changes of brain structure. Functional differences =Psychometrics= Various studies suggest measurable differences in the psychological traits of liberals and conservatives. Conservatives are more likely to report larger social networks, greater happiness and self-esteem than liberals, are more reactive to perceived threats and more likely to interpret ambiguous facial expressions as threatening. Liberals are more likely to report greater emotional distress, relationship dissatisfaction and experiential hardship than conservatives, and show more openness to experience as well as greater tolerance for uncertainty and disorder. =Behavioral studies= A study by scientists at New York University and the University of California, Los Angeles, found differences in how self-described liberal and conservative research participants responded to changes in patterns.David M Amodio, John T Jost, Sarah L Master & Cindy M Yee, Neurocognitive correlates of liberalism and conservatism, Nature Neuroscience. Cited by 69 other studies Participants were asked to tap a keyboard when the letter \\"M\\" appeared on a computer monitor and to refrain from tapping when they saw a \\"W\\". The letter \\"M\\" appeared four times more frequently than \\"W\\", conditioning participants to press the keyboard when a letter appears. Liberal participants made fewer mistakes than conservatives during testing and their electroencephalograph readings showed more activity in the anterior cingulate cortex, the part of the brain that deals with conflicting information, during the experiment, suggesting that they were better able to detect conflicts in established patterns. The lead author of the study, David Amodio, warned against concluding that a particular political orientation is superior. \\"The tendency of conservatives to block distracting information could be a good thing depending on the situation,\\" he said. A study of subjects' reported level of disgust linked to various scenarios showed that people who scored highly on the \\"disgust sensitivity\\" scale held more politically conservative views. However, the findings of a 2019 study suggest that sensitivity to disgust among conservatives varies according to the elicitors used, and that using an elicitor-unspecific scale caused the differences in sensitivity to disappear between those of different political orientations.Elad-Strenger, Julia, Jutta Proch, and Thomas Kessler. \\"Is Disgust a \\"Conservative\\" Emotion?.\\" Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin (2019): 0146167219880191. =Physiology= Persons with right-wing views had greater skin conductance response, indicating greater sympathetic nervous system response, to threatening images than those with left-wing views in one study. There was no difference for positive or neutral images. Holding right-wing views was also associated with a stronger startle reflex as measured by strength of eyeblink in response to unexpected noise. In an fMRI study published in Social Neuroscience, three different patterns of brain activation were found to correlate with individualism, conservatism, and radicalism. Zamboni G, Gozzi M, Krueger F, Duhamel JR, Sirigu A, Jordan Grafman. National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA In general, fMRI responses in several portions of the brain have been linked to viewing of the faces of well-known politicians. Others believe that determining political affiliation from fMRI data is overreaching. Genetic studies =Heritability= Heritability compares differences in genetic factors in individuals to the total variance of observable characteristics (\\"phenotypes\\") in a population, to determine the heritability coefficient. Factors including genetics, environment and random chance can all contribute to the variation in individuals' phenotypes. The use of twin studies assumes the elimination of non-genetic differences by finding the statistical differences between monozygotic (identical) twins, which have almost the same genes, and dizygotic (fraternal) twins. The similarity of the environment in which twins are reared has been questioned. A 2005 twin study examined the attitudes regarding 28 different political issues such as capitalism, unions, X-rated movies, abortion, school prayer, divorce, property taxes, and the draft. Twins were asked if they agreed or disagreed or were uncertain about each issue. Genetic factors accounted for 53% of the variance of an overall score. However, self-identification as Republican and Democrat had a much lower heritability of 14%. Jost et al. wrote in a 2011 review that \\"Many studies involving quite diverse samples and methods suggest that political and religious views reflect a reasonably strong genetic basis, but this does not mean that ideological proclivities are unaffected by personal experiences or environmental factors.\\" =Gene association studies= \\"A Genome-Wide Analysis of Liberal and Conservative Political Attitudes\\" by Peter K. Hatemi et al. traces DNA research involving 13,000 subjects. The study identifies several genes potentially connected with political ideology. Evolutionary psychology From an evolutionary psychology perspective, conflicts regarding redistribution of wealth may have been a recurrent issue in the ancestral environment. Humans may therefore have developed psychological mechanisms for judging their chance of succeeding in such conflicts which will affect their political views. For males, physical strength may have been an important factor in deciding the outcome of such conflicts. Therefore, a prediction is that males having high physical strength and low socioeconomic status (SES) will support redistribution while males having both high SES and high physical strength will oppose redistribution. Cross-cultural research found this to be the case; for females, their physical strength had no influence on their political views which was as expected since females rarely have physical strength above that of the average male.Michael Bang Petersen. The evolutionary psychology of Mass Politics. In A study on political attitudes among Hollywood actors found that, while the actors were generally more left- leaning, male actors with great physical strength were more likely to support the Republican stance on foreign issues and foreign military interventions. An alternative evolutionary explanation for political diversity is that it is a polymorphism, like those of gender and blood type, resulting from frequency- dependent selection. Tim Dean has suggested that we live in such a moral ecosystem whereby the viability of any existing moral approach would be diminished by the destruction of all alternative approaches (e.g. political balance promotes survival of the human species).

The ASAT program has since been moved from Program 640 to Program 863, the General Armaments Department and the State Administration for Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense (SASTIND, formerly known as Commission for Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense). Since its inception, the ASAT program has made progress on the development of three ASAT capable Systems: direct fire, directed-energy weapon, and microsatellites. Tests of these systems have either been directly acknowledged by the PRC, or reported on as ASAT capable. China is pursuing a broad and robust array of counterspace capabilities, which includes direct-ascent antisatellite missiles, co-orbital antisatellite systems, computer network operations, groundbased satellite jammers, and directed energy weapons. Defense Intelligence Agency chief Ashley has claimed that China has space weapons capable of shooting out satellites during the early stage of a conflict, including anti-satellite missiles, maneuvering satellites and lasers and electronic jammers. People's Liberation Army has formed military units and begun initial operational training with counterspace capabilities that it has been developing, such as ground-launched ASAT missiles. History China has worked on technologies applicable to Anti-Satellite (ASAT) weaponry since the 1964. For much of the 1960s and 1970s the majority of funding and development of ASAT capabilities were run through Program 640. The initial purpose of Program 640 was to develop anti-ballistic missiles and SAM sites, but in 1970 Program 640 began an ASAT program. The program's progress was hampered by the effects of the Cultural Revolution, because many of the prominent scientists associated with the program were among those purged by the younger generation. A review of the scholarly articles from China in the 1970s demonstrates that one prominent scientist wrote the majority of information regarding ASAT systems. In 1980, Program 640 was abandoned. The projects under Program 640 were not publicized until 1986, when Program 863 was introduced as the PRC's newest technological research and development program. Program 863 has since been closely tied to the operations of the General Armaments Department's Project 921 and COSTIND (now known as SASTIND) of the People's Liberation Army. In 2008, during the development of the JL-2 submarine-launched ballistic missile, it was reported that China was considering modifying the missile to accommodate an anti-satellite warhead to give it a sea-based anti-satellite capability. A 2016 US Congress report warns about China developing space weapons to destroy American satellites. Systems Three kinds of ASAT systems have been under development and/or active tests by the PRC. The systems are not acknowledged by the PRC as being strictly ASAT, but they are capable of destroying or disabling a satellite. =Direct fire systems= A Direct Fire System refers to the instrumentalities required for a land or vehicle based missile to strike a satellite. A Direct Fire System is a kinetic kill system designed to physically destroy or damage a satellite, instead of electronically disrupting its orbit or mission. The PRC demonstrated its ability to launch a land-based kinetic kill vehicle into a satellite when it fired a SC-19 missile into an aging Fengyun series satellite and destroyed it on January 11, 2007. No known tests of a vehicle-based Direct Fire System have occurred, but it has been reported that the new Jin-class submarine will have the ability to launch the SC-19 or a similar type of missile. =Directed- energy weapons= A directed-energy weapon is a high powered laser or microwave weapon designed to either disrupt or electrically damage a satellite. It is not yet considered a kinetic kill system because directed- energy weapon cannot physically destroy a satellite. These weapons are part of the PRC's New Concept Weapons program. One directed-energy weapon, a high powered laser, has been under development since 1995 and was tested on orbiting US satellites in 2006. =Microsatellites= A microsatellite is defined as any object orbiting the earth that has a mass greater than 10 kg and less than 500 kg. This includes man made satellites and natural satellites, like debris. While man made micro-satellites are primarily peaceful, they are easily weaponized. Because of a satellite's high relative velocity to another satellite, any collision would destroy both satellites, and micro-satellites have the advantage of being cheaper, more maneuverable and harder to track. In 2001, a Chinese newspaper stated that the PRC was testing a parasitic micro-satellite that could latch onto another satellite and destroy it on command. While no evidence has been found to demonstrate the development of such a parasite system, in 2008 the BX-1 micro-satellite released by the PRC passed dangerously close to the International Space Station at a relative speed which would have destroyed both objects had they collided. This close call raised awareness of the PRC's ability to use micro- satellites as a kinetic kill ASAT system. Associated government organizations and personnel =General Armaments Department= The General Armaments Department (GAD) of the PRC, established in 1998, has three major responsibilities. The first is to develop, maintain, and distribute all weapon systems in the PLA. The second is to manage the nation's nuclear program. The third is to oversee all space programs. The GAD has authority over all weapons development programs, including ASAT weapons. It also is responsible for space related activities, such as Project 921 (the manned spaceflight program) and the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre. Every ASAT program developed by the PRC must be developed and tested by the GAD. The GAD also includes the development branch of SASTIND, and oversees the operations of Program 863. Chen Bingde General Chen Bingde was the Director of the GAD in 2007 during the first successful test of the Chinese Direct Fire ASAT System. Being the head of all of the PRC's military involvement in space, Chen would have overseen the development of the SC-19 and authorized its deployment on January 11, 2007. Shortly after the system's success, Chen was promoted to Chief of the General Staff. Chang Wanquan General Chang Wanquan was promoted to the position of Director of the GAD after General Chen Bingde accepted the position of Chief of the General Staff. Wanquan has been in charge of development and tests of the PRC's ASAT since mid-2007. =SASTIND= The State Administration for Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense (SASTIND, formerly known as COSTIND) is the scientific branch of the PRC's military and was absorbed into the GAD when it was formed in 1998. The institution has changed over the years, and continues to change, but there are five major responsibilities within their jurisdiction. *To provide policy recommendations on anything regarding science, technology, and industry for national defense. *To organize the structure of the science, technology, and industry community in regards to national defense. *To research and develop new technologies for national defense. *To manage the safety regulations, quality standards, technical reports, and promotion of all national defense projects in the area of science, technology, and industry. *To deal with foreign interactions in the realms of science, technology, and industry. Since ASAT technology is considered a tool of national defense, SASTIND is responsible for the development of ASAT programs, and all matters regarding policy recommendations, safety regulations, organization and the projects’ global images. Zhang Yunchuan Zhang Yunchuan was director of SASTIND from 2003–2007. He received his degree from Harbin Military Engineering Institute, and spent most of his political career as a governor. Shortly after the successful ASAT test in 2007 he was promoted to Chairmen of the People Provisional Congress. Zhang Qingwei Zhang Qingwei followed Yunchuan as director of SASTIND from 2007–2009. He received a master's degree in Engineering and has spent most of his career working on the manned space flight program. Chen Qiufa Chen Qiufa replaced Qingwei as director of SASTIND in 2009. He has served in a leadership role at SASTIND since the first Direct Fire ASAT test in 2005, and he was also promoted in 2007 after the successful SC-19 test. Operations All operations listed here have either been acknowledged by the PRC, or reported by a foreign government. =2006 – Directed Energy= In 2006, the United States government reported that the PRC had marked US observation satellites with a high power laser. No significant damage to the satellites was reported; it is possible that none occurred and that the lasers used were low-power and designed for ranging, to determine exact satellite orbits, and not as ASAT weapons to blind or disrupt the satellites. =Direct Fire incidents= Failed Attempts There were two failed attempts made by the PRC to use a Direct Fire ASAT weapon. The first was on July 7, 2005 and the missile did not get close to the satellite. The second was on February 6, 2006 and the missile got close enough to the satellite for observers to question whether a near miss was the PRC's intent. 2007 – SC-19 From Main Article: 2007 Chinese anti-satellite missile test The 2007 Chinese anti-satellite missile test was conducted by China on January 11, 2007. A Chinese weather satellite—the FY-1C polar orbit satellite of the Fengyun series, at an altitude of , with a mass of 750 kg—was destroyed by a kinetic kill vehicle traveling with a speed of 8 km/s in the opposite direction (see Head-on engagement). It was launched with a multistage solid- fuel missile from Xichang Satellite Launch Center or nearby. Aviation Week & Space Technology magazine first reported the test. The report was confirmed on January 18, 2007 by a United States National Security Council (NSC) spokesman.BBC News (2007). Concern over China's missile test. Retrieved January 20, 2007. At first the Chinese government did not publicly confirm whether or not the test had occurred; but on January 23, 2007, the Chinese Foreign Ministry officially confirmed that a test had been conducted. China claims it formally notified the U.S., Japan and other countries about the test in advance. The Chinese claim is consistent with a sharp rise in queries from American sites concerning FY-1C on at least one space-related Web site starting about 24 hours before the actual intercept. =2008 – BX-1= In September 2008, the PRC sent two men into space on the Shenzhou-7. During their time in orbit the astronauts released the BX-1 micro-satellite. Within 4 hours of its release the micro-satellite flew within 27 miles of the International Space Station at a relative speed of 17,000 mph. The International Space Station will move if anything gets within 1,000 miles of its position, and the micro-satellite was well within this range and dangerously close to the Station. A collision between the BX-1 and the Station would have destroyed both objects and been fatal to the astronauts aboard the Station. The BX-1 did not strike the Station, but demonstrated China's ability to develop and deploy a micro-satellite with ASAT capabilities. =2010 – SC-19= On January 11, 2010 the PRC directed another SC-19 (雙城-19) missile at a moving target and destroyed it. This time the target was a CSS-X-11 medium- range ballistic missile launched from Shuangchengzi Space and Missile Center. While using the same systems as the January 11, 2007 test, it is not clear what the function of the 2010 test was. This test is considered to be a continuation of the PRC's ASAT testing because it employed the SC-19 system, but because the target was a missile and not a satellite the test may have been directed towards re-purposing the SC-19 missile as an ABM. =Dong Neng series= On 13 May 2013, the PRC conducted a test launched from Xichang Satellite Launch Center referred to as 'Kunpeng-7. The object was launched on a 32 deg inclination south east path to a high sub-orbit altitude of more than 18,600 miles. The launch was subsequently identified by the US as a test for the Dong Neng/动能-2 (DN-2) ASAT interceptor. On 23 July 2014, the PRC was reported to have conducted a successful land based missile test. However, the US said that the test was a 'non-destructive' test of an anti-satellite weapon. A Chinese military official confirmed in December 2015 Beijing's latest test of a satellite-killing missile DN-3 that threatens U.S. space assets. IN February 2018, the Dong Neng-3 was tested.

Life Born to hotelier parents on rue de l'oranger in Dieppe, his godfather was Nicolas Boiloy, a businessman in the Saint-Remy parish, and his godmother was the widow Michel Martel, a businesswoman in the parish of Saint-Jacques. Like his brother Jean-Vincent Deniéport, Louis was a brilliant student at the Oratorian school and won the general prize in 1785, though he had to enter the Oratorian house very young. His passion for the sea and probable aptitude for action rather than philosophical meditation interrupted his studies aged 14 when he began serving on the privateers that were common in the port of Dieppe. On these he gained seagoing skills in the subaltern posts of novice, matelot and aide-pilote. Better educated than his fellow seamen and also daring and able, he came to public attention just as the mainly-noble officer corps of the navy was weeded out on the French Revolution. On 9 messidor year II (9 June 1794), he was made an enseigne \\"entretenu\\", by decree of Salicetti, representative of the people. A note from Toulon on his bearing stated \\"his manners are pure, exact in the service, inclined neither to wine nor gaming, good in political conduct, educated, with robust health, loved by his crew\\". He took command of the corvette Brune on 5 frimaire year II (15 November 1794) and went to Toulon under the command of general Martin. He fought in the action in which the British captured the Censeur and Ça Ira. In the course of this action Le Timoléon was dismasted and sinking, under fire from three British ships surrounding it. The Brune managed to draw off the British ships' fire, for which action general Martin promoted Deniéport to lieutenant de vaisseau on 21 germinal year IV (10 April 1796). Deniéport then took part in a long campaign in the Levant and, when he came under suspicion from agents of the French Directory, the city of Sète attested to his loyalty. He thus rose up the career ladder to capitaine de frégate on 14 floréal year V (3 May 1797). On 2 brumaire year VII (23 October 1798) he received a provisional commission as a brevet capitaine de vaisseau commanding the Leander, putting him under the command of chef de division Lejoille. He was sent to Corfu, which Russia and the Ottoman Empire were hoping to annex, doing his best with a lean Greek and Venetian crew. However, his ship was surrounded by an enemy fleet and captured, though he was soon the subject of a prisoner exchange and showered with recommendations and flattering references. Commissioner general Dubois certified that \\"Commander Deniéport fulfilled all the dutier of a good officer and a brave republican\\" and the whole garrison of Corfu also witnessed to his good behaviour. Contre-amiral Perré wrote that Deniéport showed \\"conduct worthy of praise, a good officer, a true seaman, zealous, active, who very well fulfilled the several particular and very delicate tasks he was entrusted with\\". Général de division Chabot also wrote \\"This captain, with his vessel devoid of people, resisted beyond all praise\\" and vice admiral Thévenard praised \\"his zeal and his talent\\". Ill and tired out from his hard voyages, Deniéport asked for leave to spend time in Dieppe, which he had not visited for seven years.

She was married to the young banker Giovanni di Bicci de' Medici in 1386. She brought a dowry of 1500 florins to the marriage. She was known for her beauty, but her husband was known for being ugly. The marriage brought respectability to Giovanni and their children, since he was not of noble descent. Just before he died, he asked her to take care of their children. She was buried with him after her death in the Old Sacristy of San Lorenzo. Upon her death, Carlo Marsuppini wrote a eulogy in which he sang her praises, in which he compared the love between Piccarda and Giovanni with that of famous couples from antiquity.

Since the early 1990s, the results of his scientific work have been critically reviewed and found to be wrong in major parts.See chapter: The Alfred Dieck problem  Biography  Alfred Dieck was born in Bad Salzelmen, a suburb of Schönebeck near the Elberiver. After he graduated school, he studied theology and, in 1934, he changed to prehistory and anthropology and ethnography at the Martin-Luther-University of Halle- Wittenberg, where he finished with the degree of a doctor in 1939. During World War II, he was injured and returned from American imprisonment as an invalid. Both his thesis and most of his scientific records were lost during the war. For several years, he was unemployed, living in the region Bad Reichenhall and Salzburg, being the voluntary director of the International Turf Museum at Bad Wimsbach-Neydharting in Austria. Later, he was employed by the German state of Lower-Saxony. For more than 50 years, Alfred Dieck worked on his archaeological bog body finds and ethnographic studies. He collected records about bog finds from archives, museums, and personal conversations with people who found bog finds and their relatives. He also collected specimens and samples of hairs and clothing from European bog bodies and published more than 180 articles about ethnographic studies, bog bodies, and bog finds. For many years, he had been internationally recognised as one of the most reputable scientists in this field.. Dieck has put a new view of sight on the interpretation of bog body finds not only being a small regional and cultural phenomena. It has been believed that bog bodies are a phenomenon of Northern Europe (Ireland, the British Islands, Denmark, Northern Germany, and the Netherlands) only and that most of the finds are dating to the Iron Age period only some hundred years BC and AD. Dieck clearly stated out that the earliest bog body finds dating to Mesolithic periods and the youngest to the World War II. He also stated out that there are also finds known from Norway, Sweden, southern Germany and many other regions as well. Alfred Dieck died 1989 in Bremen.  Criticism  Alfred Dieck's conclusions have been criticised by other archaeologists. Dieck published many findings without referencing to proper sources. During his research, he raised the number of bog body finds from 120 in 1939 to 160 in 1951, 500 in 1968, 700 in 1972 and, finally, 1,850 bog bodies in his last summary in the year 1986. Over a period of more than 50 years, Dieck published a variety of special articles about stomach and colon investigations, individuals being tattooed, scalped, or being circumcised. But Dieck never performed the investigations on the human remains himself. He collected his information from archives, literature, and visits to museums, and from conversations with the finders and the finders' relatives. In his later years, Dieck appeared to collect information without questioning the reliability. He also cited many sources as …personally told by… or …lost during the war. First, the German prehistorian Klaus Raddatz questioned some archaeological finds published by Dieck in 1981. But still Dieck's work was accepted for many years. For their Master thesis at the University of Hamburg, Sabine Eisenbeiß and Katharina von Haugwitz compared Alfred Dieck's personal archives with reliable sources for finds in Lower- Saxony and Schleswig-Holstein. They concluded that only a small percentage of Dieck's finds could be confirmed by reliable sources, for example only 70 out of 655 bog body finds from Schleswig-Holstein.Sabine Eisenbeiß: Berichte über Moorleichen aus Niedersachsen im Nachlass von Alfred Dieck. Archäological Institute of the University of Hamburg, 1992 (Master thesis).Katharina von Haugwitz: Die Moorleichen Schleswig-Holsteins. Dokumentation und Deutung. Archäological Institute of the University of Hamburg, 1993 (Master thesis). Wijnand van der Sanden checked Dieck's reports of Dutch finds and reached the same result.Wijnand van der Sanden: Alfred Dieck und die niederländischen Moorleichen: einige kritische Randbemerkungen. In: Die Kunde N.F. Vol. 44, 1993 , pp. 127-139. Eisenbeiß and van der Sanden concluded that Dieck fabricated the findings in his publications.

Prior to the shut down of operations, it operated scheduled passenger services to 52 airports in the United States and Canada via code sharing agreements as the Delta Connection for Delta Air Lines and AmericanConnection for American Airlines. Chautauqua previously flew feeder services for other airlines as well via code sharing agreements. Its last day in operation was December 31, 2014, at which time all flying was absorbed by the Shuttle America certificate. Chautauqua had crew bases at LaGuardia Airport, John F. Kennedy International Airport, Louisville International Airport, and Port Columbus International Airport.  History  Frontier Express Embraer ERJ-145 operated by Chautauqua American Connection Embraer ERJ-140 operated by Chautauqua :Republic Airways Holdings traces it roots to Chautauqua. See also: History of Republic Airways Holdings The airline was established on May 3, 1973, in Jamestown, Chautauqua County, New York, USA, and started operations on August 1, 1974 using two 15-passenger Beechcraft 99 turboprop commuter aircraft. Chautauqua operated the Beechcraft 99 in Allegheny Commuter service and later as USAir Express. In 1984, the airline grew by adding five 19-passenger Fairchild Metro III aircraft to its fleet. In 1986, Chautauqua Airlines was purchased by GAC, an affiliate of Guarantee Security Life Insurance Company, and added twelve 30-passenger Saab 340 aircraft to replace slower Shorts 3-30s in the fleet. Chautauqua is historically significant for it is one of the last remaining companies still in business that once flew as a part of Allegheny Commuter, one of the first regional franchisee systems combining independent regional and commuter airlines under one seemingly contiguous and seamless brand. It no longer services the Chautauqua County-Jamestown Airport from which it began. In 1994, Chautauqua Airlines posted its first loss in 20 years. The loss can be attributed to the crash of American Eagle Flight 4184. Media coverage of the crash spread quickly, and because of its association, Chautauqua Airlines lost passengers who had come to distrust commuter planes. However, Chautauqua Airlines bounced back, while renewing its code-share agreement with US Airways on May 8, 1994. To better support its growing operations, the corporate headquarters were relocated to Indianapolis, Indiana. Chautauqua was acquired by Wexford Management in January 1998 and was subsequently realigned under a holding company, Republic Airways Holdings. =Build up= In 1998, Chautauqua entered into an agreement with Embraer for the purchase of ten 50-seat Embraer ERJ-145 regional jet aircraft. In 1999, Chautauqua entered into a 10-year code-share agreement with Trans World Airlines to operate at least 15 ERJ-145s for the airline. In June 2001, American Airlines, who had purchased TWA, renewed the existing regional jet service with Chautauqua for feeder service at St. Louis using 44-seat ERJ-140 aircraft. In March 2001, Chautauqua entered into a partnership with America West to operate as an America West Express affiliate using 12 ERJ-145 jets in the Eastern United States, but ended this service in February 2003. In November 2002, Chautauqua began flying regional jet service to Florida for Delta Air Lines. In March 2004, United Airlines announced that Chautauqua Airlines would operate 16 50-seat regional jets for United Express. In 2004, Republic Airways Holdings announced a new jet-service agreement with US Airways for the operation of Embraer E170 and Embraer E190 aircraft. Chautauqua was one of the first U.S. operators of the E170, but was forced to transfer these aircraft to sister company Shuttle America in 2005 after the pilots’ union at American Airlines claimed the aircraft violated a “scope clause” regulating the size of regional aircraft operated under American brands. In the first half of 2007, Chautauqua took delivery of 24 Bombardier CRJs and flew them under a code-share agreement with Continental Airlines. Some of these aircraft were previously owned by Atlantic Coast Airlines (Independence Air), and some were owned by Comair. Chautauqua eventually phased out all of its CRJ aircraft. A Fairchild 340A of Chautauqua Airlines In early 2006, Chautauqua opened its new aircraft maintenance complex, capable of holding nine aircraft, at Louisville International Airport in Louisville, Kentucky. Maintenance is performed in Indianapolis, Columbus, Louisville, and St. Louis. The ERJ-135/140/145 heavy (\\"C-check\\") maintenance is performed in Columbus. In April 2010, the Federal Aviation Administration proposed a US$348,000 fine against Chautauqua Airlines for allegedly not performing required inspections for three years. The FAA alleged that the airline flew an Embraer 145 jet for 43 days past the time one of its inertial navigation units should have been replaced. =Wind down= In October 2012, Republic Airways Holdings reworked a deal with partner Delta Air Lines, part of the company's broader effort to trim costs and boost revenue amid a decline in demand for regional airline service, to operate seven additional 50-seat Embraer 145 planes under the Delta Connection brand. In the spring of 2014, Republic Airways Holdings announced that it would begin to pull down much of Chautauqua's flying. Specifically, it would not renew its contract with United Airlines to fly ERJ-145s out of Cleveland and that it would ground all 14 ERJ-145s on April 1 in response to a shortage of qualified pilots. This was shortly followed by an announcement that it would also not seek renewal of its AmericanConnection contract. Chautauqua's operation as AmericanConnection ended on August 18, 2014. On July 28, 2014, Republic Airways Holdings announced that Chautauqua Airlines would be absorbed into Shuttle America \\"by year-end\\" to reduce costs. Chautauqua's only remaining aircraft, 41 ERJ-145s, were transferred to the Shuttle America operating certificate, effectively abandoning Chautauqua's operating certificate. On December 31, 2014 Chautauqua operated its last flight for Delta Connection. All crew and maintenance bases were absorbed by the Shuttle America certificate.

Under the University's statutes of 1570, a man over twenty-four could proceed to a BD degree ten years after matriculation without first gaining a BA degree or a MA degree. The device was not used much until the second decade of the nineteenth century. It was abolished in the mid- nineteenth-century university reforms, after criticism that it had become a route to a Cambridge degree which required no formal test of ability,Ten-year men ruling out enrolling as a ten-year man after 1858, although those enrolled by then remained members of the university, and ten-year men did not become extinct until 1900. The ten-year route to a degree was significantly used by men who had already been ordained as clergy, and wanted to increase their status by taking a degree; likewise, it found use by laymen who aspired to be ordained but who were not (usually for financial reasons) able to take a degree in the regular way. Although the ten-year BD was criticised for its lack of appropriate oversight and inadequate means of assessment, it should not be assumed that all those who enrolled for it were men of low academic abilities: most were merely from backgrounds too poor to allow them to go to university at the usual age. Scholars among them include Thomas Hartwell Horne, Cornelius Bayley, Joseph Bosworth, John Hellins and William Scoresby.

Its two main businesses consist in making the most of local renewables and unlocking energy savings.http://www.dalkia.com/en/about/ Dalkia develops alternative renewables, such as biomass, geothermal, biogas and recovered energies. The company generated €4 billion in revenues in 2017. It has approximately 16,000 employees and has been led by Chairwoman and CEO Sylvie Jéhanno since January 2017.  History  = Origins = thumb Dalkia was originally known as the Compagnie Générale de Chauffe (CGC), founded in 1935. In 1967, Chauffage Service (founded in 1944) merged into CGC. In 1980, CGC was acquired by Compagnie Générale des Eau (CGE, later renamed Vivendi in 1998). CGC merged with Groupe Montenay in 1986 to form Compagnie Générale de Chauffe/Groupe Montenay, which was further merged in 1995 to become the Energy Services division of CGE. = Creation of Dalkia = In 1998, the CGE Energy Services division was renamed to Dalkia and continued to be a subsidiary of the newly renamed Vivendi. It signed an agreement with Électricité de France in 2000 to build an international presence and expand its range of services, hence becoming a jointly owned company. Dalkia also bought the Clemessy Group, which specialises in systems for automation, mechanisation and electronics. Vivendi spun off its environmental division in 2002 called Vivendi Environnement, which was later renamed Veolia Environnement in 2003. In 2008, Dalkia sold Clemessy and Crystal to Eiffage, an energy and construction company. In 2009, the Mitie Group PLC, a UK holding company that focuses on providing strategic outsourcing and asset management services, bought the facilities management arm of Dalkia UK.http://markets.ft.com/tearsheets/businessProfile.asp?s=uk:MTO = Demerger of Dalkia’s French and international businesses = In July 2014, EDF bought the company's French business and Veolia bought its international operations. The demerger authorized the two groups to continue using the Dalkia brand for 18 months, before handing over the exclusive rights to Dalkia France / EDF. In this way, the Dalkia brand was used in France by EDF and abroad by Veolia Environment up until January 2018. Since then, it has been operated by EDF exclusively. = Since 2014 = Dalkia has now 6 energy subsidiaries and is expanding in international markets, mainly in the United Kingdom, Poland, the United States and Russia.

In 1999–2000, Soweto Community Radio and Buwa Radio merged to form Jozi FM, to form the largest community radio station in South Africa, broadcasting in several languages including: English, isiZulu, Sesotho, Sepedi, Setswana and Xitsonga. The station's radio format is 50 percent music and 50 percent discussion. The studios are based at Khaya Centre in Dube, Soweto in South Africa and covers regions all across Soweto, Kagiso, Lenasia, Krugersdorp, Randfontein, Kempton Park, Germiston and Alberton. Jozi FM was first broadcast in 1999 and can claim a competitive audience of 564,000 (RAMS Nov 2009). Jozi FM is the first community radio station to be listed on the DSTV's audio bouquet. Jozi FM attributes its success to the relationship it has with its audience. The radio station is a voice for the surrounding communities and focuses on delivering on the demands of its listeners. The subject matters range from education, information and fun and entertainment. Being a community radio station is not only a geographical aspect but entails responsibility to the community in terms of advertising, sales and marketing to grow local businesses using radio as a medium. History As a community radio station, Jozi fm was expected to fail from the on set. Many were skeptical about the lack and insufficiency of reliable equipment and the station battled to secure a loyal listenership. The station was involved in numerous scandals which included fired deejays and numerous changes of station managers. various deejays such as the late Fana Khaba, Penny Lebyane,Penny Lebyane Zanele Magoso-Luhabe and Mapaseka Makoti launched their careers at the station, not to mention Phindi Gule, Patrick Guma, Khanyi Mkhonza, Vusi Langa, Hlengiwe Mabaso, Nyakalo Leine, Christ Matshaba, Owatile Jacobs, Siphiwe Mtshali, Papa Moalusi and Khumbuzile Thabethe. Roughly 80 percent of the deejays moved on to join bigger stations such as Kaya FM, Metro FM, Motsweding FM, Lesedi FM, SAFM and YFM and East Coast Radio. Among the few that remained include Dudu Gama, Andrew Tshaka and Rich Twala. The station continued to be the main DJ provider for many radio stations in Gauteng, Free State and North West. Jozi FM was involved in a dispute regarding management and control of the radio station by various groups, which accounted for the skepticism surrounding management and board. The issue of contracts became a recurring one and programme managers were often accused of nepotism.

One day, he steals a briefcase from a dodgy clergyman (Robert Helpmann), which is full of pound notes. Unfortunately, the notes all have the same serial number! He is seduced by \\"the big money\\" and starts passing the counterfeits, one bill at a time. Much of his need for money is to impress Gloria (Belinda Lee), the pretty barmaid at his local pub. She dreams of the millionaire who will come and give her the good life. Unfortunately, he cannot pass the fake money fast enough to keep up with her wants. When she helps herself to some of the counterfeit money, it gets the attention of the police and the mobsters. It all ends in a free-for- all, between the police, Arabs, and mobsters, in disguise. Finally, she has to decide whether she loves him or his money. The Big Money (1958 Poster) Partial cast * Ian Carmichael – Willie Frith * Belinda Lee – Gloria * Kathleen Harrison – Mrs Frith * Jill Ireland – Doreen Frith * Robert Helpmann – The Reverend * James Hayter – Mr Frith * George Coulouris – The Colonel * Renée Houston – Bobbie * Michael Brennan – Bluey * Leslie Phillips – Receptionist * Harold Berens – Bookmaker * Hugh Morton – Valet * Ferdy Mayne – Furrier * Digby Wolfe – Harry Mason * Michael Balfour – 'Wilberforce' Production and release Ian Carmichael had played a support role in the film of Simon and Laura (1955) for Rank and starred in a significant hit, Private's Progress, for the Boulting Brothers. This led to the Rank Organisation offering him a three-picture contract of which this was to be the first. Carmichael said the movie would be \\"a sad disappointment, and, after working in such close accord with John and Roy for twelve weeks, a frustrating and nail biting experience.\\"Carmichael p 316 Diana Dors was originally cast as Gloria but turned down the role. Belinda Lee played the role instead. It was one of several comedies she made at Rank. Filming took place at Pinewood in April 1956 and took ten weeks. Carmichael says when he read the script he felt the premise was \\"a good one and the early sequences gave it a promising start\\" but that \\"very soon it descended into the broadest comedy cliches.\\" He complained to the producer and director who did not share his concern so Carmichael \\"took the matter higher.\\" The Rank Organisation had employed Bryan Forbes as an in-house script doctor and staff writer and he was sent the screenplay. He and Carmichel spent two days working out an amended treatment and Forbes went to write up the scenes. The executive producer found out about this and pulled Forbes off the film – Carmichael says the movie was shot as per the original script.Carmichael p 317 The film's release was cancelled in July 1956 because Rank Organisation head Sir John Davis did not believe it was sufficiently funny. According to critic Alexander Walker, Davis reportedly considered it \\"too terrible to show\\", although Walker described it in 1993 as \\"almost indistinguishable from the general run of other Rank products.\\" Carmichael, then making Brothers in Law said \\"all I can say is if the powers that be think the film is unfunny I'm relieved they're not going to show it.\\" Helpmann said \\"I applaud the courage of Mr Davis' decision but I can take no responsbility for the unfunniness of the film.\\" Release In 1958 producer Hugh Stewart was working on a Norman Wisdom movie that involved scenes at Ascot. The director, John Paddy Carstairs, remembered there were Ascot sequences in The Big Money and suggested Stewart look at it. The producer felt the film could be released with some additional editing and music.Carmichael p 318 This led to a June 1958 release and screenings on Rank's Odeon circuit. Producer Joseph Janni took his name off the credits. Reception Variety said \\"all Stewart's labors cannot disguise the fact that Davis was right in the first place. Though sparking from an amusing idea, \\"The Big Money\\" is funny only in spots. It is bogged down by gag situations that are telegraphed, and feeble dialog... Though it may prove a modest filler in certain British houses, it Will do nobody's reputation any good if it is entered for U.S. consumption.\\"Review of film at Variety Carmichael said that Stewart's \\"confidence was misplaced. The Big Money should have remained incarcerated or, better still, destroyed.\\" It led to the termination of Rank's contract with Carmichael by mutual agreement. The actor wrote in his memoirs \\"I didn't like factory farming, which was what I assessed the film production at Pinewood to be at the time, and they, no doubt, didn't like my argumentative interference in a side of the production which they probably considered to be none of my affair. The fact that all along I had been wrong about The Big Money could also only have rankled.\\" References Notes * External links The Big Money at BFI * 1950s crime comedy films 1958 films British films British crime comedy films English- language films Films directed by John Paddy Carstairs Films shot at Pinewood Studios 1958 comedy films Films set in London ","title":"The Big Money (film)"},{"id":"31496968","title":"2011 Norwich City Council election"},{"id":"31497014","text":"Choreutis aegyptiaca is a species of moth of the family Choreutidae.

It is the first part of the Night of the hurricane block with Family Guy and American Dad!, the first such event in the animated television line-up of Fox. The episode first aired on Fox in the United States on October 2, 2011. Seth MacFarlane was initially approached by Kevin Reilly, the president of the entertainment division of Fox, with the idea of a crossover. The episode was first announced at the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con International. It was originally scheduled to air on May 1, 2011 as the twenty-first episode for the second season of the series, but was delayed until October 2, 2011 because of the 2011 Super Outbreak. Plot As the Brown/Tubbs family prepares to head for a cruise, a news report states that a hurricane, named Flozell, hits Stoolbend. Not deterred, the family tries to salvage what is left of their vacation. However Cleveland discovers that Donna doesn't stock food in the house long-term, to which she points out that he trashed what little food they had. When the family tries to pray to God to help them ride out the storm, Cleveland, Jr.. shocks everyone by revealing that he does not believe in God, although he claims he is not an atheist either, which he calls \\"another religion\\", pointing out that some atheists, such as Brian Griffin have been just as condescending and judgmental as those they criticize. The family members attempt to persuade Cleveland, Jr. through reason, emotional appeal, and even a production number, but instead find their own senses of religion and faith tested. As the storm worsens, an increasingly hungry family confronts Cleveland, Jr. when they discover he had food stored in his room. Cleveland, Jr. explains that, as the only one who heard of the storm beforehand, he used a very scientific method to ration the food. When the family is still resistant to his non-religious lifestyle, accusing him of wanting the food all to himself, Cleveland, Jr. locks the food away in spite. Cleveland calls on God to smite Cleveland, Jr. for his actions, at which point a tree crashes through the house and pins him instead of his son. The family members are unable to lift the tree by hand and decide to pray to God for help. Cleveland, Jr. is able to rig together a pulley system and lifts the tree using his own weight. The family disagrees over whether God was involved in Cleveland, Jr.'s actions and the belief of Cleveland, Jr. is left unresolved as the hurricane heads for Quahog. Production and development Kirker Butler wrote the episode. The crossover event was first announced in July 2010 by series creator Seth MacFarlane at the Comic-Con International in San Diego, California. It was the first of its kind in the history of the animated television line-up on Fox. Kevin Reilly, the entertainment president of the Fox Broadcasting Company, originally pitched the idea for the crossover, which was inspired by theme nights of comedy shows from the 1980s. MacFarlane described the crossover event to be an \\"enormous challenge\\" and a \\"substantial undertaking\\"; he chose to do one central story line so that each writing staff would not have to write stories for unfamiliar characters. He was also willing to do another crossover event if this one receives successful ratings. In April 2011, the executives of the Fox Broadcasting Company officially announced that the episode would air on May 1 as part of the Night of the Hurricane crossover, alongside the Family Guy episode \\"Seahorse Seashell Party\\" and the American Dad! episode \\"Hurricane!\\". However, on April 29, it was announced that the crossover event would be removed from the schedule, in response to a series of tornadoes that killed nearly 300 people in the Southern United States. The crossover was subsequently replaced by repeats of \\"I Am the Walrus\\" from American Dad!, \\"Brian Writes a Bestseller\\" from Family Guy, and \\"Ain't Nothin' But Mutton Bustin'\\" from The Cleveland Show. MacFarlane later agreed with the decisions after being consulted with the executives of Fox, and a spokeswoman for the company later announced that the episode would air the succeeding season. Ratings \\"The Hurricane!\\" first aired in the United States on October 2, 2011 as part of the animation television night on Fox. It was preceded by episodes of The Simpsons, and its sister shows American Dad! and Family Guy. It was viewed by 4.73 million viewers upon its initial airing, despite simultaneously airing with Desperate Housewives on ABC, The Amazing Race on CBS, and a match between the Baltimore Ravens and the New York Jets on NBC. \\"The Hurricane!\\" garnered a 2.6/6 rating in the 18-49 demographic, according to the Nielsen ratings.

Personal life Wrigley was born in Oldham, Lancashire, England on 16 February 1924. He studied architecture at the College of Art and Design, graduating in 1945. He acquired qualifications in structural engineering, civic design and town planning from Manchester University. In addition to teaching, Wrigley practiced as an architect, industrial designer and solar consultant. He is now retired from formal practice but his career has spanned from designing and creating aids for disabled people to investigating emerging concepts in design, particular energy saving ideas such as applications for solar energy in building. Career Emigrating from the United Kingdom to Sydney, Australia in 1947, Wrigley began his career in Australia as a lecturer at the New South Wales (NSW) University of Technology, where he stayed until 1957. Here he established the first Building science course in Australia for architects. Wrigley left Sydney for Canberra in 1957 to take up the position of assistant to Fred Ward at the Australian National University (ANU). Following Ward's retirement in 1961, he was appointed University Architect, where he built up the Design Unit to cover all aspects of design within the university to include site planning, architecture, interior design, furniture, landscape, graphics and site signage. He retired from ANU in 1977.http://www.anu.edu.au/emeritus/members/Derek_Wrigley.html Wrigley joined the Victorian Chapter of the Society of Designers for Industry (SDI) in 1948 and initiated the formation of the NSW chapter of the SDI with Alistair Morrison and Arthur Baldwinson in 1950. The SDI would become the Industrial Design Institute of Australia (IDIA) and later the Design Institute of Australia (DIA), with Wrigley appointed its inaugural Honorary Secretary and Treasurer, a position he held until 1957. In 1956, Wrigley together with Fred Ward, co-founded the NSW Chapter of the Industrial Design Council of Australia (IDCA). As Canberra expanded, he saw the need to have an Australian Capital Territory (ACT) Chapter of the IDCA, initiating its formation in 1958. he was appointed its Chairman when it was incorporated in 1973, and was the president from 1980 until 1981. In that same year he co-founded the ACT Craft Council, where he was appointed Vice President for two years. Wrigley retired from the IDA Board in 1986. Wrigley's attention turned to new emerging concepts in design, in particular energy saving ideas that resulted from good design. To propagate his ideas further, he helped establish a non-profit group called The New Millwrights in 1978, which consisted of a group of concerned professionals whose aim was to inform the community about socially responsible alternatives to home design and energy use.http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/?irn=120627&search;=Education&images;=&c;=&s;=1 He organised the Technical Aid to the Disabled (TAD), ACT Branch in 1979. He was elected Vice President of TAD Federation of all Australian states in 1980 and assisted in the establishment of a joint Design AID Committee between the Design Council and the National Committee of Independent Living Centres. He was the Design Coordinator of the TAD until 1991. He is currently retired from formal practice, and is researching applications for solar energy in building and experimenting with low-energy and low-resource retrofitting of existing houses. Awards Wrigley was awarded Life Fellowship of the DIA in 1980, he is also a Fellow of the Australian Institute of Architects (AIA), an Associate of the Royal Institute of British Architects and holds a Diploma of Architecture from the College of Art and Design, Manchester, United Kingdom. Notable projects Wrigley built a solar house in Griffith, ACT which is listed by the AIA as an 'outstanding' building for its time. The house was designed by Wrigley in 1957 and completed in 1959 as his personal residence. The original building is an example of the post-war Melbourne regional style whereas the western extension to the house, designed by Wrigley in 1966, is an example of the late twentieth century Sydney regional style. 14 Jansz Crescent is regarded as a significant residence by the AIA because in its component parts, it is a good example of two architectural styles. Another notable project by Wrigley is the Mawson House, a townhouse in suburban Canberra that was retrofitted by Wrigley to use renewable energies rather than fossil fuels. The house incorporates a series of devices to improve its energy efficiency, generating its own solar electricity, ventilating and cooling itself without cost or pollution and treats its own gray water for irrigation. Wrigley wrote, designed and self-published Making Your Home Sustainable in June 2004, describing the various low-energy features of the Mawson house. It is also a practical guide for home-owners, builders and architects who are concerned about the effects of climate change and environmental degradation.

During her 1647 arrival to and departure from New Netherland, her captain was Jan Claesen Bol, who was 28 at the time. The ship carried Petrus Stuyvesant, the new Director-General of New Netherland, his wife Judith Bayard, and Stuyvesant’s councilors to Manhattan, where they landed May 1647. During her time in port, Captain Bol sat in council with Stuyvesant and others in New Amsterdam. When she sailed from Manhattan to Amsterdam on 16 August 1647, she was loaded with 200,000 pounds of dyewood from Curaçao and around 14,000 beaver pelts. It was also carrying 107 passengers and crew, including the recently fired Director Willem Kieft for his return to Amsterdam. He was returning to defend himself against the charges leveled by among others, the Rev. Everardus Bogardus (the colony’s principal Dutch Reformed dominie), and banished colonists Jochem Pietersen Kuyter and Cornelis Melyn, who would also have to answer charges of insubordination for their role in Kieft’s ouster. The other passengers included numerous Dutch West India Company soldiers who had recently arrived in Manhattan from Brazil and the Caribbean. On 27 September 1647, Captain Bol mistook the Bristol Channel for the English Channel and ran Princess Amelia aground off Mumbles Point, Wales, near Swansea, Wales, () where she broke apart.

It aired in the United States on NBC on November 18, 2010. Plot Dean Pelton (Jim Rash) accuses Jeff (Joel McHale) of creating a fake course in conspiracy theories taught by \\"Professor Professorson\\". Jeff leads the Dean and Annie (Alison Brie) to Professorson's supposed office, which is revealed to be a closet. He starts explaining this must be a conspiracy to test him until a nearby man (Kevin Corrigan) introduces himself as Professorson. He explains that he usually teaches night school, congratulates Jeff, and departs. Satisfied, the Dean leaves, but when Annie apologizes for doubting Jeff, Jeff admits he faked the class and has never seen \\"Professorson\\" before. Troy (Donald Glover) and Abed (Danny Pudi) build a blanket fort in Abed's dorm; other students help to expand the fort. Annie discovers that Professorson's real name is Professor Woolley. Despite threatening messages, the two explore the night school, which they discover is a sham. After a chase through the now-sprawling fort, they catch Woolley. Woolley explains that like Jeff, he once forged a course for credit; to maintain the charade, he had to fake an entire night school. Suspicious, Jeff recognizes Woolley as drama professor Sean Garrity; Garrity drops the façade and reveals the Dean staged everything. Jeff decides to get even. Jeff and Annie bring in the Dean and pretend to expose \\"Woolley\\"'s sham. Feigning a lack of forgiveness, Annie \\"shoots\\" Garrity with a prop gun. The Dean suddenly shoots Annie; in response, Jeff shoots the Dean. Annie sits up and tells Jeff she and the Dean created the night school ploy to teach Jeff a lesson about academic dishonesty. The Dean then sits up, and Jeff, who had deduced that Annie helped the Dean, reveals he and the Dean wanted to teach Annie about being a better friend. Upset, Annie reveals another gun and shoots Jeff. The Dean becomes terrified and confused by the conspiracies. Jeff sits up and explains that he and Annie created the ploy with another prop gun because the Dean switches alliances too quickly. Garrity rises and collects the guns, but a security officer (Craig Cackowski) enters and shoots Garrity, horrifying the other three until they realize it was yet another prop gun – the officer and Garrity wanted to show the dangers of misusing prop guns. Traumatized, the Dean still denies Jeff credit for the class. Later, Abed and Troy see the fort mentioned in Greendale's newspaper, making it \\"mainstream.\\" With that, they collapse the entire fort.  Production  The episode was written by Chris McKenna, his fourth writing credit on the series. It was directed by Adam Davidson, his fourth time directing the series. He has previously directed episodes for series like Big Love, Fringe and United States of Tara.  Reception  In its original American broadcast, \\"Conspiracy Theories And Interior Design\\" reached approximately 4.4 million households with a 1.9 rating/6% share in the 18–49 demographic. The episode received positive reviews from the critics. Cory Barker, of TV Surveillance, said, \\"good lord [it] is hilariously funny and flat-out fun\\" and \\"Conspiracy Theories and Interior Design\\" is simply an amazingly fun episode of the best comedy on television at the height of its powers.\\" Furthermore, Kelsea Stahler, of hollywood.com, said \\"The \\"Conspiracy Theories and Interior Design\\" episode is a departure from the outlandish, grand zombie- space-simulator-Betty White fueled romps and a return to the formula that the show perfected back in season one. The show also keeps the childish wonder and the ensuing hilarity that Donald Glover's Troy brings to it with a subplot in which he and Abed create a blanket-fort city that takes over an entire dorm. Say what you will about relying on formula, but Community formula is 100 percent its own and when it comes to this stuff, nobody does it better.\\"  References  External links *\\"Conspiracy Theories and Interior Design\\" at NBC.com Community (season 2) episodes 2010 American television episodes Works about conspiracy theories ","title":"Conspiracy Theories and Interior Design"},{"id":"31497320","text":"The Sinful Village () is a 1966 West German comedy film directed by Werner Jacobs and starring Michl Lang, Marianne Lindner and Gunther Philipp.BFI.org It was based on the play Das sündige Dorf by Max Neal which had previously been made into a 1940 film of the same title.Goble p.341 Cast *Michl Lang as Thomas Stangassinger *Marianne Lindner as Therese Stangassinger *Gunther Philipp as Korbinian *Thomas Alder as Sepp Stangassinger *Hannelore Auer as Afra *Hans-Jürgen Bäumler as Herbert Stangassianger *Beppo Brem as Vogelhuber *Peggy March as Sängerin *Franz Muxeneder as Wegscheidbauer *Margitta Scherr as Vevi *Ruth Stephan as Barbara Veit *Manfred Streibert as Boeller-Birtel *Hubert von Meyerinck as Anwalt See also *The Sinful Village (1940) *The Sinful Village (1954) References Bibliography * Goble, Alan.

It is part of the collection Sonetti romaneschi, sometimes listed as number 361Coarelli (2000) pp.14-5 quote: Giordani (1975) quote: Muscetta (2002) p.151 or 362.Vighi (1992) p.290Teodonio (1991) p.141Malato (1998) p.1015 Content The sonnet is primarily a satire of 1800s Italian civilization. However, in analyzing the raw, crude politics of his own time Belli touched upon a much broader section of Italy’s history, and of the losses the nation suffered from foreign invasions and local abuses of power. The parable quoted above describes the latter phenomenon. A king confiscates all of his vassals’ possessions; when the people ask why, the king replies that he can treat them as he likes because he matters and they do not. Although phrased in vulgar terms, this remark encompasses a living reality. Thus Belli from this brief anecdote part to analyze the particular condition of the populace and mediocre Italian which, because of its same condition of choice, is always found to suffer and to keep the head bent in front of who is more powerful. As it says in the sonnet the author, who is not a Pope, King or Emperor in our society, and that counts for nothing less than the earth we walk. And so, returning to speak feudal monarch, warns the people who dared to question his statutes and cruelty that was out of the mouth, it would have been put to death, because perhaps the Executioner was the only honest work to do, if you had not powerful, says the king. And the people, stupid, inferior, stupid and gullible, cheering applauding the king's words. Among the translators of the sonnet, Peter Nicholas Dale, which translated it into Strine, the Australian English dialect of the 1960s, in which title is rendered as The Lieders a the Old World. The verse Io sò io, e vvoi nun zete un cazzo (literally \\"I am I, and you are fuck all\\") was famously appropriated by Mario Monicelli in his 1981 movie Il Marchese del Grillo, in which it is rendered in modern Romanesco dialect as \\"io sò io e voi nun siete un cazzo,\\"Monicelli (2009) quote: . and has since then become a frequent quote of contemporary Italian culture.Berselli (2010) quote: Notes References *Berselli, Edmondo (2000) Senza più regole in l'Espresso, March 11, 2010 *Coarelli, Filippo and Giuseppe Gioachino Belli (2000) Belli e l'antico: con 50 sonetti di G.

History  Different Csepel lorries on contemporary matchboxes, in the 1960s In 1944 the Steyr 380 truck was designed in Austria, licensing Csepel lorries and engines. Production of the MÁVAG and the RÁBA lorries stopped after nationalization in 1946. In 1947 Hungary bought the licence for the Steyr 380 lorry, D413 and D613 engines from the USSR. At this time the Soviets occupied the Eastern part of Austria. In 1949 an automobile factory was established in the NIK (Nehéz Ipari Központ—en: Heavy Industry Center) at the earlier Dunai Repülőgépgyár—en: Danube Aircraft Factory place at Szigethalom. The first Csepel (NIK) engine was ready on 7 November. The first director of the factory was Ferencné Bíró. She was a mechanical engineer and had studied in Moscow, sister-in-law of Mátyás Rákosi. The first 3 Csepel D-350 was ready on 3 April 1950. The D350 and B350 types were produced between 1950 and 1958. The B-130 4x4 rover pickup lorry began production in 1949. The prototypes were made in Győr and Ikarus. It won a lorry race in Poland in 1950. During 1968–1975 the evolution of Comecon (Council for Mutual Economic Assistance) changed the way Csepel operated. Csepel began shipping the undercarriage of the Ikarus to other factories for completion. Labor-MIM in Esztergom and later the Polish Jelcz & Star performed the final assembly. In 1968 the Csepel started a new generation of RÁBA lorries incorporating the MAN engine (licensed). In 1975 the Csepel stopped engine production entirely, instead using the RÁBA engine. From 1976–1980 the factory built 1000 Volvo C202 Laplanders. In 1996 Csepel went bankrupt because Ikarus had not paid for the transported undercarriages, having not been paid by its own customers. In 2007 a D344 EZF lorry arrived with success on the Budapest-Bamako Rally in the touring category. In 2009 a D420 fire-engine body built on a D344 undercarriage lorry arrived with success on the Budapest-Bamako Rally in the touring category.

To keep the aircraft within a reasonable width for driving with fixed wings, the inventor used many wing surfaces along the length of the vehicle. Design and development Frank E. Skroback was an inventor with several patents. His concept of a roadable started with sketches in 1927. The vehicle was inspired by the French designs of Henri Mignet and his Flying Flea. The prototype was completed in 1934. The finished prototype used 3 pairs of short seven foot span biplane wings positioned at the front, middle and rear of the vehicle. A small set of rudders on the rear wing assembly could be operated differentially to provide yaw and roll in flight. The vehicle was powered by a tractor configuration Continental A-40 engine driving a propeller. The \\"body\\" or fuselage, used spruce stringers, was fabric covered and resembled a dirigible in shape. The wheels were positioned in the conventional taildragger configuration. Operational history Initial tests in 1945 proved the vehicle lacked rudder authority on the ground. It was placed in storage, then work commenced again in 1957. The vehicle was road driven in Syracuse, New York and Maine. The Willowbrook Village Museum in Newfield, Maine had the vehicle in its collection, but later considered it out of the museum's scope. It was offered by auction in Atlanta, Georgia in 2010, with a sale price of $66,175.

The episode was written by Nora Smith and directed by Jennifer Coyle. According to Nielsen ratings, it was viewed in 4.81 million viewers in its original airing. The episode featured guest performances by Todd Barry, Larry Murphy, and Paul F. Tompkins. Plot Bob celebrates the restaurant's 100,000th burger and puts it on sale for half- price. A controversial documentary filmmaker named Randy (Paul F. Tompkins) starts filming his new documentary outside the restaurant, and ties a cow, named \\"Moolissa\\" (a male cow with a blonde wig on it) outside the restaurant. Bob sees this, and Randy explains his challenge for him: he can kill Moolissa and make her into a burger, or let her live; he is to make his decision when a timer placed outside the restaurant, called the \\"Cow-ntdown,\\" stops. Bob becomes embarrassed about the whole situation, as well as Louise frequently calling him a murderer. Despite this, as a result of the publicity, the restaurant starts attracting more customers. Later that night, Bob has a nightmare where he is in court, accused of killing Moolissa, and loses the case. He wakes up and sees it is raining outside and finds that Randy has left Moolissa tied-up outside in the rain. Feeling sorry for Moolissa, Bob decides to let him into the house. While the children react positively to the idea, Linda demands that Bob put the animal back outside. However, they fail to get Moolissa down the stairs, and as a result he ends up staying inside with the Belchers. Randy finds Bob with the steer inside and reminds him that he has two days until the Cow-ntdown ends and to make his decision. The next morning, Linda reveals that she successfully let Moolissa out of the house (by putting him on a mattress with socks on), only to discover Moolissa missing. Meanwhile, Tina and Louise discover that Moolissa's feces resembles a smiley face emoticon. This leads Tina to believe that Moolissa is sending messages to her through his feces. Louise then decides to prank Tina by shaping Moolissa's feces into emoticon symbols with a pastry bag to lead Tina into thinking that he is still sending messages to her. One night, however, Louise decides to shape the feces into the shape of an \\"angry face\\" emoticon. Tina becomes upset after reading this and decides it is time for her and Moolissa to move on. With Moolissa stolen, the Belcher family and the film crew team up to look for her, and discover that the cow was taken by a couple as an attraction for their discount petting zoo. That night, they successfully take her back, and get back to the restaurant in time for the timer to end and for Bob to make his decision. However, Bob says he wants more time, leading to an argument between him and Randy. As they argue, they fail to notice that Moolissa is walking across the road into the path of a moving van. The van's driver is able to hit the brakes right before Moolissa gets hit, but Moolissa dies shortly after of a heart attack. Tina is saddened over his death, but discovers his feces shaped into a heart emoticon. Bob faints after her death and enters his subconscious, where he is in heaven with Moolissa (voiced by Todd Barry). Moolissa tells Bob that he wants him to make a burger out of him, and they share a passionate kiss. The next day, Bob holds a funeral for Moolissa at the restaurant and decides to name his 100,000th burger the \\"Rest in Peas burger\\" as the crew films it for the documentary. Reception In its original American broadcasting, \\"Sacred Cow\\" was viewed by an estimated 4.18 million viewers and received a 2.2 rating/5% share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49, a drop from the first two episodes. Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B, saying \\"I'd like to see Bob's Burgers try to do some kind of plot other than “Someone comes along and annoys Bob.” The characters are all genuinely likable and funny, and the jokes build on one another nicely. It's worth a smile when Louise and Gene tell Bob that they're wired and ready to attack as they break into the petting zoo, and then the zoo's owner shows up, and they tear into her (“Gene! ATTACK!”), teeth and all, allowing the cow to be repossessed. There's enough to like here that it shouldn't have to fall into a storytelling rut... already.\\" References  External links  2011 American television episodes Bob's Burgers (season 1) episodes ","title":"Sacred Cow (Bob's Burgers)"},{"id":"31497506","text":"Elise Aulinger (11 December 1881 – 12 February 1965) was a German film actress.BFI.org Aulinger was born in Munich and died in Munich at age 83.

Mannie, \\"Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) architecture\\", RFC 3945, Oct. 2004, IETF. is a protocol suite extending MPLS to manage further classes of interfaces and switching technologies other than packet interfaces and switching, such as time-division multiplexing, layer-2 switching, wavelength switching and fiber-switching. Differences between MPLS and GMPLS Generalized MPLS differs from traditional MPLSGMPLS RFC 3945 \\"1.2. Multiple Types of Switching and Forwarding Hierarchies\\" in that it extends support to multiple types of switching such as TDM, wavelength and fiber (port) switching. For instance, GMPLS is the de facto control plane of wavelength switched optical network (WSON). The support for the additional types of switching has driven GMPLS to extend certain base functions of traditional MPLS and, in some cases, to add functionality. These changes and additions impact basic label-switched path (LSP) properties: how labels are requested and communicated, the unidirectional nature of LSPs, how errors are propagated, and information provided for synchronizing the ingress and egress LSRs. How GMPLS works GMPLS is based on Generalized Labels. The Generalized Label is a label that can represent either (a) a single fiber in a bundle, (b) a single waveband within fiber, (c) a single wavelength within a waveband (or fiber), or (d) a set of time-slots within a wavelength (or fiber). The Generalized Label can also carry a label that represents a generic MPLS label, a Frame Relay label, or an ATM label.

Its Ballynary line is descended from Shean Duff O'Higgins (fl. 1600 C.E.), Gaelic Baron of Ballynary, who was married to a daughter of the royal family of O'Conor at Ballintuber Castle in Connacht. Shean Duff O'Higgins himself claimed descent from King Niall of Tara (d. 450 C.E.).The National Genealogical Office (Dublin), MS 165. p. 396-399.Annals of the Four Masters M378-405Geoffrey Keating, Foras Feasa ar Éirinn 1.48, 1.49, 1.50, 51, 52 Historically, many of their ancestors were poets and scholars who enjoyed the patronage of several chiefly families including O'Conor Don, MacDermott, O'Doherty, O'Gara, and MacDonagh. O'Higgins are counted among the Gaelic nobility as a sept of the royal house of O'Neill.See List of Irish clans.The National Genealogical Office (Dublin), MS 165. p. 396-399.Genealogy of Ó hUiginn from O Clery Book of Genealogies (based on edition by Séamus Pender, Analecta Hibernica 15, 1951) Members of this family were further ennobled in 1724 by James III (pretender to the throne of England and Ireland) during his exile in France. A branch that emigrated to Spanish America was ennobled in the Spanish nobility in 1795 and 1796 by Charles IV of Spain; later members of this branch became prominent in the liberation and politics of republican Chile. Family name Earlier scholars traced the origin of the name from the word \\"knowledge\\" in Irish, possible linked to the family's early prominence as bards to the Gaelic Kings.letter from Prof. Eóin Mac Neill to Prof. Knott written in December 1919. However, more recent scholars have identified that \\"uigin\\" refers to a Norse seafarer or Viking.The bardic poems of Tadhg Dall Ó hUiginn (1550–1591), Eleanor Knott (ed.), London, 1920 and 1926 In Gaelic times the prefix Uí before a name was used to signify descent from a grandson, this family are said to have descended from the grandson of Uiginn who lived in the 11th century or possibly from a previous Uiginn who was a grandson of King Niall of Tara. In modern times the surname has often been translated from Irish into \\"Higgins\\" in English although members the more senior branches of the family continue to use \\"O'Higgins\\". =Background= The O'Higgins family originated in the Kingdom of Meath and Brega which equate to the modern Irish counties of Meath and Westmeath. As a sept of the Southern Uí Néill their roots in these areas can be traced at least to the 5th century and possibly even earlier. By the 12th century the senior branch of the family had migrated into the Kingdom of Connacht where they settled and were granted large estates by the O'Conors in Sligo at Dooghorne and Monteige in the Barony of Luighne under the protection of the O'Hara Chiefs and at Ballynary in the Barony of Tir-Errill under the protection of the MacDonagh Chiefs. From the Council of Drom Ceat in 574 AD up to the end of the Gaelic era in the 17th century various members of the O'Higgins clan were hereditary poets (filés in Irish) in the courts of Irish Princes and Chiefs.The Book of Glendalough Rawlinson MS B 502 Oxford, Bodleian Library c. AD 1130Keating, G. The History of Ireland. Section 10. As hereditary poets they were accorded a status of nobility second in rank only to the King and were entitled to wear the same number of colours in their robes. Members of this family came under the patronage of other Irish noble houses particularly Ó Conor, Ó Neill, MacDonagh, Ó Rourke, Maguire, Ó Doherty, Mac Dermot and Ó Gara. From the 14th to the 17th centuries the O'Higgins were among the most prolific poets in the courts of the Irish Princes.:Eleanor Knott, Bardic Poems of Tadhg Dall Ó hUiginn (1922), I, xx–xxii: =Loss of status and migration= Due to their loyalty to Gaelic culture and religion, the O'Higgins family of Ballynary suffered under the English Crown in Ireland and by 1654 had lost their lands in Sligo.O'Rorke, T. (1889) \\"The History of Sligo Town and County Vol. II – Conclusion\\" (Dublin: Duffy & Company). While some members of the family remained in Sligo as tenants on their own lands, some members of the family migrated to Spain where they achieved high office in the service of the King. The O'Higgins of Ballynary migrated to Summerhill in Co. Meath where they lived at Clondoogan and Agher. In 1751 Ambrose O'Higgins (ca. 1720–1801) left Summerhill in Co. Meath for Cadiz in Spain from where he went to Peru and Chile. In 1788 he became Governor General of Chile. He was ennobled by King Carlos IV of Spain initially in 1795 as 1st Barón de Ballinar and again in 1796 when he was raised to Marqués de Osorno.Letters patent from King Carlos IV 27 January 1796 in Archives of the Indies. His son Bernardo O'Higgins was a leader of the Chilean patriot forces in the Chilean War of Independence and a leading officer of the Army of the Andes; he became the first Head of State of Chile in 1818. His son Pedro Demetrio O'Higgins Puga (1818–1868) was a Chilean politician and entrepreneur. Ambrose O'Higgins' brother William (Guillermo) O\`Higgins (1722–1772) was Captain of the Spanish troops and Colonial Administrator in Paraguay.

William Tooke, 1820 engraving by Joseph Collyer after Martin Archer Shee. Life Tooke was the second son of Thomas Tooke (1705–1773) of St. John's, Clerkenwell, by his wife Hannah, only daughter of Thomas Mann of St. James's, Clerkenwell, whom he married in 1738. The family claimed connection with Sir Bryan Tuke and George Tooke. William was educated at an academy at Islington kept by one John Shield. In 1771 Tooke obtained letters of ordination as deacon and priest from Richard Terrick as bishop of London; and received from John Duncombe the offer of the living of West Thurrock, Essex, in the same year. This he declined on being appointed chaplain to the English church at Kronstadt. Three years later, on the resignation of Dr. John Glen King, Tooke was invited by the English merchants at St. Petersburg to succeed him as chaplain there. In this position he made the acquaintance of many members of the Russian nobility and episcopate, and also of the numerous men of letters and scientists of all nationalities whom Catherine II summoned to her court. He was a regular attendant at the annual diner de tolérance which the empress gave to the clergy of all denominations, and at which Gabriel, the metropolitan of Russia, used to preside. Among those whose acquaintance Tooke made was the French sculptor Étienne Maurice Falconet, then engaged on his statue of Peter the Great. On 5 June 1783 he was elected Fellow of the Royal Society, and on 14 May 1784 was admitted sizar of Jesus College, Cambridge, but neither resided nor graduated. Shortly afterwards he became a corresponding member of the Imperial Academy of Sciences at St. PetersburgRachel May, The Translator in the Text: On Reading Russian Literature in English (Northwestern University Press, 1994: ), p. 13. and of the Free Economical Society of St. Petersburg. While chaplain at St. Petersburg Tooke made frequent visits to Poland and Germany, some details of which are printed from his letters in John Nichols's Literary Anecdotes. At Königsberg he made the acquaintance of Immanuel Kant. In 1792 Tooke was left a fortune by a maternal uncle, returned to England, and devoted himself to writing. In 1814 Tooke served as chaplain to the lord mayor of London, Sir William Domville, and preached in that capacity several sermons, which were published separately. Tooke resided during his latter years in Great Ormond Street, Bloomsbury, but moved to Guilford Street just before his death, which took place on 17 November 1820. He was buried on the 23rd in St. Pancras new burial-ground. An engraving by J. Collyer, after a portrait by Martin Archer Shee, is prefixed to his Lucian. Works Tooke early turned his attention to literature, and in 1767 published an edition of John Weever's Funeral Monuments. In 1769 he issued in two volumes The Loves of Othniel and Achsah, translated from the Chaldee. The \\"translation\\" was merely a blind, and Tooke's object appears to have been to give an account of Chaldean philosophy and religion; he evinces an acquaintance with Hebrew. This was followed in 1772 by an edition of Mary Magdalen's Funeral Tears by Robert Southwell. In 1777 he published Pieces written by Mons. Falconet and Mons. Diderot on Sculpture ... translated from the French by William Tooke, with several additions, London. His residence at St. Petersburg had given him chances for the study of Russian history, and he now set to work to publish the results of his researches. He had already translated from German Russia, or a compleat Historical Account of all the Nations which compose that Empire (London, 4 vols. 1780–1783). In 1798 appeared The Life of Catharine II, Empress of Russia; an enlarged translation from the French (3 vols), more than half of which consisted of Tooke's additions. It was followed in 1799 by A View of the Russian Empire during the Reign of Catharine II and to the close of the present Century (3 vols); a second edition appeared in 1800, and was translated into French in six volumes (Paris, 1801). In 1800 Tooke published a History of Russia from the Foundation of the Monarchy by Rurik to the Accession of Catharine the Second (London, 2 vols). In 1795 he produced two volumes of Varieties of Literature, followed in 1798 by the similar Selections from Foreign Literary Journals. He was principal editor, assisted by William Beloe and Robert Nares, of the New and General Biographical Dictionary, published in fifteen volumes in 1798; and in the same year he wrote Observations on the Expedition of General Bonaparte to the East A few years later he began a translation in ten volumes of the sermons of the Swiss divine Georg Joachim Zollikofer. The first two appeared in 1804 (2nd edit. 1807), two in 1806, two in 1807, and two in 1812; they were followed in 1815 by a translation of the same divine's Devotional Exercises and Prayers. He contributed largely to the Monthly Review and the Gentleman's Magazine, and is credited with the authorship of the memoir of Sir Hans Sloane, written in French, and extant in Brit. Mus. Addit. MS. 30066 (Cat. Addit. MSS. 1882, p. 30). His last work was Lucian of Samosata, from the Greek, with the Comments and Illustrations of Wieland and others, London, 1820, 2 vols. For Rees's Cyclopædia he contributed articles on Geography (perhaps of Russia) but the details are not known. Family Tooke married, in 1771, Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas Eyton of Llanganhafal, Denbighshire, by whom he had issue two sons, Thomas Tooke and William Tooke, and a daughter Elizabeth.

Many of these articles highlight some of the secular freedoms instituted by Habib Bourguiba in 1956, such as access to higher education, the right to file for divorce, and certain job opportunities. While women in Tunisia have enjoyed certain freedoms and rights that are often denied to women in neighboring countries, the social norms have shifted since 2011. Even though some aspects of society are relatively liberal, the regime still classifies itself as a Muslim. Inheritance laws for women have been changed to give women equal share of inheritance to men in contrary to Islamic law of inheritance . Demographics As of 2008, the U.S. Population Reference Bureau reported that Tunisia's population of women between the ages of 15 and 49 was 3,000,000. By 2015, there will be 3,100,000 women of the same age bracket in the country. The life expectancy for women, from birth, is 76 years (men in Tunisia have a life expectancy of 72 years).Flag of Tunisia History When Tunisia was still a colony of France, the majority of Tunisian women were veiled, uneducated and performed the domestic duties required by husbands and fathers. However, with the onset of the country's independence movement, a voice for equality between men and women emerged. In fact, by the early 20th century, many urban families were educating their daughters. When Tunisia regained its independence in 1956, the republic's founder—Habib Bourguiba—discussed repeatedly the need to include all persons in Tunisian society. In 1956, The Code of Personal Status (Tunisia) was enacted—a document that has undergone heavy reform since its inception. This document has abolished polygamy and repudiation, enabled women to ask for divorce, enacted a minimum age for marriage and ordered the consent of both spouses before marriage. Moreover, women earned the right to vote in 1957 and in 1959, women were able to seek office. The Constitution of Tunisia promulgates “the principle of equality” which has been applied favorably for women within the judiciary system, enabling them to enter untraditional job sectors (for example medicine with Habiba Djilani the first female surgeon, the army and engineering) as well as open bank accounts and establish businesses. In 1962, women were able to access birth control and by 1965, abortion was legalized (8 years before American women gained access). In 1993, feminists and women's organizations’ lobbying efforts resulted in certain modifications to the Code of Personal Status. The modifications stated that a wife was not obliged to obey her husband, but did require her to “share part of the financial burden of the family”. Despite releasing women from obedience to their husbands, they were now required to equally contribute to managing family affairs. However, a vague clause within the Code requires women to “deal with their husbands in accordance with custom and tradition.” This clause makes it difficult for women to assert their independence (and thus ability to contribute to her family's financial burden) because 'tradition' and 'custom' are often used to reinforce a woman's subservience. After the Association des femmes tunisiennes pour la recherche et le développement and the Association tunisienne des femmes démocrates (ATFD) presented a document in which they demanded the full implementation of the agreement, the Tunisian government ratified the agreement on September 20, 1985. As for the reservations shown by Tunisia at the signing of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women in 1979, they show that those in power have not yet decided to take the step of equality. The agreement was signed on July 24, 1980, but with reservations, like other Muslim countries, concerning a few paragraphs of sections 15, 16 and 29 on the grounds of their contradictions with the provisions of the Code of Personal Status and the Quran.Organisation des Nations unies, Traités multilatéraux déposés auprès du Secrétaire général, éd. United Nations Publications, New York, 2004, p. 246 « La Tunisie va adhérer au protocole additionnel de la convention de l’ONU », Agence France-Presse, 8 mars 2008 To mark the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the implementation of the Code of Personal Status (Tunisia), president Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali announced two Bills that were adopted by the Chamber of Deputies of Tunisia on May 8, 2007. The first reinforces the legal housing rights of mothers having custody of children, and the second establishes a minimum age for marriage, at 18 years, for both sexes despite the fact that the actual average age at marriage had already surpassed 25 years for women and 30 years for men.Olivia Marsaud, « Cinquante ans d’indépendance féminine », Radio France internationale, August 13, 2006 In matters related to motherhood, Tunisia is often considered as a country open to changes coming from the modern world.Samir Amin, L’économie du Maghreb, éd. de Minuit, Paris, 1966Ridha Boukraa, « Notes sur le planning familial et pouvoir politique au Maghreb », Revue tunisienne de sciences sociales, n°46, 1976 On the occasion of the announcement on March 8, 2008 that the government would adhere to an additional protocol of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, coinciding with the International Women's Day, the president of the ATFD, Khadija Cherif, described the process as \\"positive but insufficient\\" and said it would continue \\"to advocate for the lifting of reservations that emptied the Convention of its meaning\\". Tunisia observes several national holidays dedicated to women: International Women's Day (March 8)Monique Pontault [sous la dir. de], Femmes en francophonie, coll.

La trace et l’héritage, éd. Karthala, Paris, 2004, p. 108 In effect, even though the Economic growth is not negligible, it does not stand out from other countries in North Africa such as Morocco; as well, the suppression of the free speech and the political opposition in Tunisia have long tarnished the country's reputation abroad. The status of women remains a domain in which Tunisia, while under Bourguiba as under Ben Ali, could vindicate its uniqueness. Colette Juillard-Beaudan believes that Tunisian women, And this type of propaganda bore fruit as the country enjoyed, during the reign of Bourguiba, a solid reputation of national and civil secular in a region that more often consists of military dictatorships or monarchies connected to religion,Franck Frégosi et Malika Zeghal, Religion et politique au Maghreb : les exemples tunisien et marocain, éd. Institut français de relations internationales, Paris, mars 2005, p. 7 as the CSP was itself declared in an authoritarian manner, since it was not debated publicly or in the Tunisian Constituent Assembly.Paola Gandolfi et Moncef Djaziri, Libia oggi, éd. Casa editrice il Ponte, Bologne, 2005, p. 37 On February 9, 1994, a Tunisian Women's Day was organized by the Senate of France under the slogan \\"Une modernité assumée, la Tunisie\\" (in English: Tunisia: Embracing Modernity). Shortly after a debate organized in June 1997 in the European Parliament on the situation of human rights in Tunisia, Tunisians were dispatched to Strasbourg to give Europe another image of their country. A series of laudatory articles followed in the French press on the condition of women in Tunisia. In October 1997, during Ben Ali's official visit to France, the Tunisian regime's defenders also cited the status of women, while ignoring the criticisms of the organizations defending human rights: In August 1994, during a conference devoted to women and the family, the Association tunisienne des femmes démocrates (ATFD) denounced the ambiguity of the forces in power and the use of religion to control the status of women in the country, criticizing foremost \\"the patriarchal oppression of women\\". Moreover, women attempted to rebel against the official discourse were quickly called to order, notably through the bias of a Tunisian press rigorously controlled by the authorities. The president of the ATFD, the lawyer Sana Ben Achour, explained in March 2010 that her organization was living in a She denounced among other things, the \\"police inclosure\\" of the ATFD headquarters and its women's university, and the fact that the association was prevented from staging a theatre production that was supposed to mark the March 8 International Women's Day. In this context, filmmaker Moufida Tlatli — made famous by her film The Silences of the Palace (1994) — was heavily criticized« Traînée dans la boue » selon les propos de Sophie Bessis, « Le féminisme institutionnel en Tunisie », CLIO HFS, n°9/1999, 22 mai 2006 in the Tunisian magazine Réalités for having shown her scepticism towards the supposed feminism of Islam during a television program broadcast in France in October 1994: On August 13, 2003, the 47th anniversary of the enactment of the CSP, the Ligue tunisienne des droits de l'homme (in English: Tunisian League of Human Rights) declared :  Fashion  Prior to the 2011 revolution, Tunisia restricted women's right to wear the hijab. Even though the population of Tunisia is 98% Muslim, and women in the Muslim world commonly wear hijabs, the governments of both Ben Ali and Habib Bourguiba pursued the eradication of public Islamic traditions, including hijab. In 1981 Habib Bourguiba ratified law no. 108 effectively banning Tunisian women from wearing hijab in state offices. In 1985, he went further and ratified law 108 extending this ban to educational establishments. During Ben Ali's regime, the government began cracking down on females wearing the hijab. In 2008, Amnesty International reported that women were forced to remove their hijab before being allowed into schools, universities, workplaces and some were even forced to remove it on the street. The report goes further stating that scarfed women were denied entry to the Tunis International Book Fair and at times were taken to police stations and made to sign a written commitment to stop wearing the hijab. \\"Some of those who refused were assaulted by police officers\\". While recent changes under the new government of the Ennahda Movement have lifted restrictions on wearing the hijab, a broader shift in social values toward Muslim conservatism has caused women to feel more restricted in many ways. A number of women complain that they can no longer wear skirts because of harassment by men. Additionally, they state that hijabs have become a social requirement instead of an option.Jamie Dettmer, Tunisia’s Dark Turn, The Daily Beast, 17 March 2013. Education Although these facts appear to put women in Tunisia on par with Western women, only 30% of women are employed. Women's minimal participation in the work force does not derive from lack of education. In fact, 91% of Tunisian women, between the ages of 15 and 24, are literate. Young women represent 59.5% of students enrolled in higher education in Tunisia. In addition, the level of illiteracy for girls and women ages ten years and over dropped from 96% in 1956 to 58.1% in 1984, 42.3% in 1994 then 31% in 2004 (the level among men was 14.8% in 2004). The main reason behind this change has been the number of girls enrolled in primary education: 52 female students for every 100 male students in 1965; as well as the number of female students enrolled in secondary schools: 83 female students for every 100 male students in 1989, an increase from the level of 37 in 1965.Stephen Ellis, L’Afrique maintenant, éd. Karthala, Paris, 1995, p. 154 Compared to the regional statistic, only 65% of MENA women are literate. More women are enrolled in secondary school (81%) than their male counterparts (75%). Although, Tunisian girls have a high enrollment rate, many girls drop out during or after they complete their primary education. Tunisia's enrollment rates for girls are higher than its surrounding neighbors, including Algeria, Egypt, Morocco, Syria, Yemen, and even Lebanon and Jordan. Women in Tunisia are also less likely than men to enter a career in business, economics or engineering. This phenomenon may be due to the disconnect between content learned in school and needed skills to participate in the labor force. Women's participation in the work force Women constitute 26.6% of the workforce of Tunisia in 2004, an increase from 20.9% in 1989 and only 5.5% in 1966. Female participation and mobility in the labor force are constrained by the socially acceptable behavior of women in Tunisia and even laws. For example, women are discouraged or prohibited by family members from traveling far from home (in both rural and urban environments). Indeed, traveling alone is not an option for a woman or girl. Therefore, given that a job involves commuting, often alone, to the location of work, for women this is socially unacceptable and/or prohibited. Certain Tunisian laws restrict the type of work women participate in, the number of hours they work as well as require a woman's husband or father to approve of her job and hours worked. The World Bank found that women in Tunisia and the surrounding region (MENA) do not use the same job search methods as men of the same region. Women are significantly less likely to use networking with a friend or contact an employer directly to obtain employment. The World Bank research found that women struggle with finding a suitable working environment because they fear sexual harassment and working long hours. Within the MENA region, the Tunisian government offers the shortest amount of time for maternal leave for women (30 days). Separate maternity leave laws apply to women who work in the public or private industry. Women who work as civil servants or public employees have 60 days of maternity leave while those women who work in the private industry only receive 30 days. In comparison, The Family and Medical Leave Act, in the United States, enables mothers (and fathers) to take up to 6 weeks. They work in all areas of business, as well as the Army, the Civil Aviation or Military and police and represent 72% of pharmacists, 42% of the medical profession, 27% of judges, 31% of lawyers and 40% of university instructors. In addition, between 10,000 and 15,000 of them are entrepreneurs. However, unemployment affects women more than men since 16.7% of women work in private employment rather than the 12.9% rate of men as of 2004. From 1999 to 2004, job creation for women grew at a rate of 3.21%, to produce an average of 19,800 jobs per year. Post January 2011 Immediately prior to the Tunisian revolution of 2011, women represented 14.89% of the government, 27.57% (59 of 214) of the elected members of the Chamber of Deputies elected on October 25, 2009, 27.06% of municipal councillors and 18% of the members of the Economic and Social Council. Moreover, in the absence of a law on equality (after the Tunisian revolution of 2011), the principle of parity was adopted in April 2011 for the election of the Tunisian Constituent Assembly of 2011.Caroline Fourest, parity-tunisienne_1511532_3232.html \\"Gender Tunisian\\", Le Monde, April 22, 2011 In 2017 a law was passed that, among other things, declared that men who had sex with underage girls would not be able to avoid being prosecuted by marrying those girls, changed the age of consent from 13 to 16, criminalized marital rape and sexual harassment, and made wage and work discrimination against women punishable by a fine of 2,000 Tunisian dinars ($817). Currently many Tunisian feminists are worried that the rights they enjoyed before the revolution may disappear as the power vacuum is infiltrated with religiously zealous ex-pats returning to the country. Women such as Munjiyah al-Sawaihi and Fawzia Zouari, known Tunisian feminists, are worried that the Tunisian revolution will follow the past examples of Algeria and Iran where women who played active roles during the revolutionary period, however, lost their voice and ability to participate in the public sphere when the new regimes established strict Sharia Law. Ennahda and women The Ennahda Movement is Tunisia's most popular Islamic party and the party with the largest number of seats in the Constituent Assembly. However, due to its foundation on Islamic thought, the party has gained the largest number of critics nationally and internationally, and specifically regarding women's rights. Since the 2011 revolution, the party stated the following in regards to Tunisian women and what would happen if they were to get elected: * The party would not legalize polygamy. In fact, the party leader stated that \\"polygamy has been determined to be illegal\\" in (their interpretation) of the shariah law. * Hijab will become legal in all areas of life in Tunisia, and will be a personal choice. * Women will retain their right to wear whatever they want, \\"including bikinis\\". * They will not amend the Status Code. In addition, the party voted in favor of full gender equality in the October Elections, and they were the most effective of all parties in mobilizing women in rural areas. Rural areas are commonly dominated by males in the Arab world. Marry-your-rapist law Until 2017, Article 227 of the Tunisia Criminal Code provided a rapist with exemption to avoid all investigations or legal consequences if he married his victim. Laws of this kind have been termed “marry-your-rapist” laws. There has been an increasing trend towards repealing laws providing this impunity, with Tunisia following suit in July 2017. =Background= Laws of this type are historically common and still exist around the globe. Tunisia is a nation that places great cultural importance on the chastity of women. In such cultures, the loss of chastity has significant societal consequences for the woman and her family; regardless of whether this violation has been non-consensual. The duty to be a virgin was found to be considered a “social rule to be maintained” by 90% of Tunisian women aged between 15 and 59 years. Therefore, the rationale for marry-your-rapist laws, such as Article 227, is rooted in shielding the victim from the cultural shame of rape. Marriage is a way for the family to escape the “scandal” of what has occurred. Salma Nims, the secretary general of the Jordanian National Commission for Women, explained this state of affairs in saying, “a woman who is the victim of a sexual assault is actually considered responsible for the honour of the family and may have to get married to whoever assaulted her in order to protect that”. Proponents believe Article 227 protected women as, in Tunisia, prospects of marriage decline considerably in the instance of rape. Thus, Article 227 was aimed at providing a victim with the opportunity of a husband despite the cultural taboo of a loss of virginity. The Tunisian Government acknowledged that Article 227 was premised on striking a balance between the rights of the woman and those of the family. It was explained the law was motivated by consideration of the position of the victim and her family, however advantageous this may end up being for the perpetrator. Further, there is the view of a rejection of legal interference into the private affairs agreed to among the rapist, the victim and her family if marriage is settled upon as the solution. Under Article 227, a victim must still consent to the marriage, with the option available to her to refuse the marriage. Marry-your-rapist laws raise debate as to the appropriateness of such laws in the cultural context of a country like Tunisia. Opponents of Article 227 in Tunisia criticise the “second assault on a rape survivor’s rights” that the law supports by trapping the victim in a marriage to her rapist. Issue has been raised with Article 227 as it assumes that the best remedy for a victim of rape is marriage, without consideration of her own rights to freedom, dignity and autonomy. Article 227 has also been condemned as providing immunity to rapists by encouraging private settlements between the victim's family and the rapist rather than reporting of the crime for prosecution. While the victim has the option to refuse the marriage, there may be significant pressure from her family to accept the marriage for provisional reasons, particularly in the case of the rape resulting in pregnancy. Frequently, fault is focused on the victim's actions to bring about the rape, thus creating a sense of responsibility for the cultural dishonour brought upon the family. Victims are often blamed and shamed into extracting a report of rape in favour of hiding the occurrence to conserve the honour of the victim's family. =Campaigns= Opposition to article 227 has been voiced through broader advocacy campaigns pressuring governmental action to end violence against women in Tunisia. On December 13, 2016, by authority of article 227, a Tunisian Court ordered a 13-year-old girl was to marry her 20-year-old rapist who had impregnated her. A fellow judge in the case made comment on the judgment, calling article 227 an antiquated law but accepting it must be applied. This decision ignited protests of public outrage in Tunisia calling for the revocation of article 227. The day following the Court's decision, politicians, legal experts and members of the public were involved in a protest demonstration outside the Tunisian Parliament building. In response to this political demonstration, the Tunisian Justice Minister, Ghazi Al-Jeribi, announced the Prosecutor General would file an objection to the Court's decision as Tunisia was in the process of developing changes to article 227. Tunisian human rights organisations protested the decision on the basis that it violated international human rights treaties as well as Tunisian laws protecting the rights of children. Amnesty International raised concern that the law contravenes Tunisia's obligations under the Convention on the Rights of the Child to provide particular protection for children from sexual coercion and violence. The marriage of the 13-year-old victim to her 20-year-old rapist was also condemned for contravening Tunisia's international obligations to prevent marriage of a child under Article 16(2) of the Convention on Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and Article 23(2) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The Tunisian campaigns for repeal were supported by the collective action of regional feminist organisations such as the Tunisian Association of Democratic Women collaborating efforts with activist NGOs like the International Federation of Human Rights. The Tunisian Ministry for Women, Family and Children also called for the order to be nullified as a violation of article 20 of the Child Protection Code aimed at safeguarding interests of a minor. Reform following public outcry for repeal has been seen worldwide, with Tunisia joining countries such as Lebanon, Costa Rica, Uruguay, Peru, Romania and France that have repealed marry-your-rapist laws. However, countries such as Algeria, Iraq, Kuwait, Bahrain, Palestine and Syria currently retain provisions providing perpetrators impunity from rape prosecution. =Legislative Reform= On July 26, 2017, Tunisia's Parliament accepted wide-ranging new legislation aimed at the protection of women against all forms of violence. The legislation consists of 43 articles in five chapters addressing gender- based violence. This law eliminates the impunity provided for perpetrators by repealing Article 227 of Tunisia's Penal Code, coming into effect in 2018. In the vein of protestor's arguments against Article 227, Parliament recognised in this legislative reform that psychological violence constitutes a form of violence against women. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein, supported the introduction of the new law, even stating there is “no place in today’s world for such hideous laws”. The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women has appealed to Tunisian Parliament to amend article 227 since 2010, voicing concern about the impunity provided to perpetrators to allow them to benefit from their own violence. The law was carefully drafted over six months due to the social importance of such a change that has been advocated by activists for decades. Tunisian Parliament is unique as more than 30% of representatives are women, the highest female representation of any Arab country. Upon passage of the legislative reform, parliamentarians broke into cheers and chants of the Tunisian national anthem. The comprehensive law has been heralded as revolutionary, predicted to break significant ground in addressing women's rights issues in Tunisia. However, commentators on the new reform have still voiced concerns that the legislation does not go far enough to address violence against women. Issue has been raised for the continuance of the social practice of marrying a victim to her rapist despite the legal abolition of a perpetrator's impunity. Due to the cultural stigma attached to rape in Tunisia, families may still view an arrangement of marriage as the favoured, more private solution. Experts consider legal abolition of marry-your-rapist laws only the first step in truly eradicating the occurrence of this practice. It has been said that raising social awareness of equality of women at the community level is required in conjunction with legal reform. Amnesty International voiced concern that Tunisian institutions still lacked adequate services to provide protection for child victims with the continued social practice of marrying the victim to her rapist. As a child is legally considered an adult once married, there is no ability for a child protection delegate to intercede to advocate for the child's continued medical or psychological care. However, as there is also stigma attached to psychological treatment, families of the victim will rarely make this provision for the child of their own accord. Therefore, some commentators on the abolition of marry-your-rapist laws in Tunisia consider there needs to be a conjunctive improvement to protective services for child victims of sexual violence in addition to the repeal of article 227.

History  Kansai Area Prefectural Union Joint Exposition (1910) Nagoya Exposition (1928) The park's history goes back to the year 1909. In 1910, the 10th Kansai Area Prefectural Union Joint Exposition was held at Tsuruma Park. It features a large water fountain and a gazebo for music bands from the early 20th century, constructed in the European style fashionable at that time. The fountain tower decorated the venue's main square, and since then has become one of the symbols the park. Engineer Teiji Suzuki designed the tower in a combination of Eastern and Western styles with Roman marble pillars and rock structures. The tower was temporarily removed due to construction on Nagoya Municipal Subway line 3 (Tsurumai Line), but it was restored in 1977. The fountain tower was designated as a Municipal Cultural Property in 1986. Located within the park is the Tsuruma Central Library. The park has a Greenification Center that is run by the Nagoya City Greenery Association. The park has Yoshino cherry, Japanese andromeda, Japanese zelkova, Flowering quince, Tulip, Camellia, Thunberg spirea, Pearlbrush, Rapeseed, Common snapdragon, and Swamp chrysanthemum. Tsuruma Park is popular during the Sakura blossom viewing season in spring, as well as for outings and events such as the Nagoya Walkathon. Closest access by public transport is the Tsurumai Station by the Tsurumai Line, or with the JR Chuo Line to Tsurumai Station. With the release of the mobile game Pokémon Go in Japan, the park fountain became known as a \\"pilgrimage site\\" among Pokémon fans because it looks like a Poké Ball from above. On July 24, 2016, hundreds of Pokémon Go players, buoyed by false rumours of a Mewtwo appearing in the area, swarmed the park in search of rare Pokémon.

Launch Contact 94 launched at 6am GMT on 5 September 1988 by former Radio Caroline disc jockey,Caroline and Kevin, Bob Le-Roi. Kevin Turner. The first song played was \\"Good Day Sunshine\\" by The Beatles. History Whilst the station was to broadcast Radio Nova, via satellite, overnight and the equipment had arrived in advance of the launch, the engineer who had been due to install the equipment was stuck in Jersey due to a heavy fog. On the opening night therefore Paul Easton broadcast between 11pm and 3am, with a sustaining music tape filling the remaining hours until resumption of live programming the following morning. Contact 94 carried the UK sustaining service Supergold overnight from November 1988 until February 1989. On 3 February 1989 the station went off air on 97.7 MHz. Rumours surfaced that this was an enforced closure by the French police pending an investigation by the authorities regarding whether the station was a 'pirate'. It was decided by regional courts that the station was broadcasting illegally and transmission equipment was confiscated. An appeal was successful in overturning this ruling and the station returned to the air. The station used a 950 MHz link between the studios at Lessay and its transmitter and one humorous incident in the stations history was when this signal was overcome by the ETACS analogue mobile phone signals on the island operated by Jersey Telecom in collaboration with Cellnet,Our History , JT Global. the result being that some local mobile telephone calls were in fact broadcast on Contact 94's FM frequencies.

The 94.6 MHz frequency was the most problematic, being very close to BBC Radio 3's Jersey frequency of 94.8 MHz. The station broadcast using an 80 kW transmitter.

It is a popular performance among the native Sasak people. The name gendang beleq is a Sasak language term, which means \\"big drum (big gendang)\\", as the performance is about a group of musicians playing, dancing and marching with their traditional instruments, centered on two big drum (gendang) players.  Instruments  The big drum (gendang beleq) musicians, the main players in the ensemble. The accompanying gong beleg players. The ensemble for gendang beleq performance consists of main players with of two (occasionally four) large drums. They are followed by players using a gong, a traditional flute (suling), some hand-held kettle-gongs (similar with bonang), and many sets of cymbals (Ceng-Ceng). The size of the ensemble is usually 12–15 persons, with three people to carry and play the heavy gong. The drum is made from a wood frame with goat skin drum-head. The wood is selected from woods which is hard yet light. The goat skin is selected from goats that are approximately 5 years old to make drums with the best sound. There are two different types of gendang used in the ensemble: the male and female gendang. Each is made from a male and female goat. These two types of gendang have different sound quality. The player for the ensemble is called sekehe. It is composed of males only (usually young boys). There are many gendang beleq clubs in Lombok. These clubs are supported and sponsored by the Indonesian government as a way to promote Sasak culture and to involve the youth in cultural activities. The clubs usually practice once a week.

It is the 74th Oswald short produced by Lantz and the 125th overall. Plot summary Oswald is dancing on an urban street until it suddenly rains. He then runs into a five and dime store. Because his shorts are quite saturated, Oswald grabs a wringer and heads somewhere within the store to dry it. The place he goes to, however, turns out to be the shop's display window where the outside crowd see him and laugh. When he returns to the main part of the shop, Oswald befriends the store clerk whose appearance resembles the girl beagle. The clerk asks Oswald if he could play the piano. Oswald insists as he plays the instrument and sings the song \\"I Found a Million Dollar Baby (in a Five and Ten Cent Store)\\", thus getting attention from the store patrons. While the patrons watch Oswald's performance, a puppy, who looks like a browner version of the boy beagle, parts from his mother and decides to explore the store. After a few moments of wondering and playing some toys, the puppy finds a stout man and a thin man. Obliged to play a prank on the two men, the puppy throws a fish at the stout man's head. The stout man thinks the other person did it, and therefore delivers a haymaker onto the thin man. The thin man is sent airborne, knocking all the dishes off the shelf. To avoid trouble, the puppy knocks a Venus de Milo statue off its platform, and replaces it with himself. The store's manager steps out of his office and is infuriated by the mess. Believing Oswald was responsible, the manager expels the young rabbit from the store and fires the clerk. Oswald and the disposed clerk go on to buy wedding garments. They then marry each other and find themselves a home.

The line is named after the Rankbach stream. It is served by the Stuttgart S-Bahn between Böblingen and Renningen. History  The Ranbbach Railway opened on 1 October 1915. The reason it was opened was because the Germans needed a quicker means of transport to the front line during World War I and was used commercially once the war ended. On 29 September 1970 passenger operations between Renningen and Sindelfingen were abandoned. As part of the planning for the Stuttgart S-Bahn, capacity was created by shifting the operation of freight trains from sections of the Stuttgart–Würzburg and Gäu lines to the Rankbach line, which was upgraded in the early 1970s. The line has been electrified since 10 April 1972. In the course of the electrification the line speed was also increased from 60 km/h to 80 km/h. The section between Maichingen and Böblingen was opened as part of the Stuttgart S-Bahn network on 10 June 2010. Regular operations started on 14 June 2010. The remaining section to Renningen was opened on 8 December 2012. Operations  =Freight = Freight services use the line in particular to: *bypass the Böblingen–Vaihingen–Stuttgart West–Prag Tunnel–Zuffenhausen–Kornwestheim Rbf (marshalling yard) route in order to ensure that the Stuttgart S-Bahn has sufficient capacity and to avoid steep gradients. *supply parts for the Sindelfingen Daimler factory *transport assembled car from the Sindelfingen factory to Bremen for export. Every day about 40 freight trains run on the line, most of which start or finish at Sindelfingen. From late March to mid-October 2008 the line between Sindelfingen and Renningen was closed for the upgrade of the line for the introduction of S-Bahn services. All freight trains were diverted to the Gäu Railway and the freight curve between Stuttgart Nord station and Kornwestheim. =Passengers = Prior to 10 December 2004 the line was only regularly served by the so-called “Daimler trains” between Sindelfingen and Horb via Böblingen, running at shift changes from the station located at DaimlerChrysler's Sindelfingen plant. =Construction and commissioning of the S60 = On 14 June 2010, the Böblingen–Maichingen section was taken into regular S-Bahn service as line S 60. For this service, the Sindelfingen–Maichingen section was duplicated and the Böblingen station was rebuilt, among other things. The platforms at all stations were also rebuilt and all level crossings were eliminated. As of June 2006 the total cost of the investment for the reconstruction and development was about €120 million. The work on the first “Böblingen” section was completed in late March 2007. The Federal Railway Authority (Eisenbahn-Bundesamt) approved at the beginning of May 2007 the second \\"Sindelfingen\\" planning section and the Verband Region Stuttgart (which coordinates public transport in the Stuttgart Region) issued zoning approval for it. The main work on this section was carried out in 2008 and the track was completely blockaded from the end of March to October 2008. The third section, known as \\"Magstadt–Renningen\\", which also includes duplication,See for instance \\"Streckenausbau\\" on the Magstadt–Renningen section. obtained planning approval in late summer 2008, with construction beginning in 2009 so that the line could open at the end of 2010. Additional activities in relation to the replacement of the level crossings in Magstadt and Renningen (such as land acquisition) meant that Verband Region Stuttgart was obliged to delay the commissioning of the section to late 2011. Opening of full services has since been delayed until late 2012. Since 14 June 2010 an S-Bahn shuttle service has operated from Monday to Friday at 30-minute intervals from 5:00 to 23:00, using class 420 electrical multiple units. Trains run from Böblingen—where it connects with line S1 services from Herrenberg to Stuttgart—via Sindelfingen to Maichingen. It is therefore also possible to transfer to the Schönbuch Railway. From mid June 2011, S 60 services ran on weekends and holidays. This was determined by the transport committee of Verband Region Stuttgart on 22 December 2010. Since 8 December 2012 operations have been conducted as follows: the additional S 6 services that run during peak hours from Stuttgart to Weil der Stadt are divided in Renningen with part going to Böblingen and the other part to Weil der Stadt. Moreover, some of the S 6 services that stop short in Leonberg are extended to Renningen and Böblingen. Outside the rush hour trains run between Renningen and Böblingen, without running past Renningen. In contrast, Böblingen has good connections to services on line S1 and the Schönbuch Railway.

State of Wisconsin Legislative Reference Bureau Informational Bulletin 99-1, September 1999  Background  Berner was born in Ireland and attended school until the age of fourteen, when he became a tailor. In 1887, at the age of eighteen years, he sailed for Rio de Janeiro and remained in Brazil for about one year, when he took passage for New Orleans. After remaining there a short time he went to Puerto Limón, Costa Rica; then moved on to New York City, to Boston, Massachusetts and to St. Louis, Missouri, working at the tailoring trade in every place visited. In 1893 he moved to Milwaukee, and worked for other tailors until 1898, when he enlisted in Company G, Fourth Wisconsin Volunteer infantry and served in the Spanish–American War. He was mustered out in February 1899, and became the manager of tailoring departments in various Milwaukee retail stores.  Public office  He was elected to the Assembly for the 9th district of Milwaukee County (9th ward of the City of Milwaukee) in 1912 (Socialist incumbent Edmund J. Berner was running for the state senate), receiving 1,209 votes against 1,035 for Socialist Herman O. Kent, 459 for Republican Eugene Herman, and 31 for Prohibitionist Frank F. Wolfe. He was assigned to the standing committee on printing.The Wisconsin blue book Madison: Democrat Printing Co., State Printer, 1913; pp. 281, 286, 673 He does not appear to have run for re- election in 1914.

He was born in Coimbra. Career After graduating from Colégio Militar and failing his second year at Academia Militar, Robles was initially commissioned a conscripted second lieutenant (in Portuguese \\"Alferes miliciano\\") of infantry. In 1960, he volunteered for training and assignment to a new Portuguese special operations and counterinsurgency force, the Companhias de Caçadores Especiais (Special Sharpshooter Companies, or CCE). The initial Caçadores Especiais companies were composed of volunteers from standard infantry units who were considered better adapted for intensive training in antiguerrilla operations.Afonso, Aniceto and Gomes, Carlos de Matos, Guerra Colonial (2000), , pp. 94-97 Trained at the Centro de Instrução de Operações Especiais (CIOE, or Center for Special Operations Instruction)Later retitled Centro de Tropas de Operações Especiais, or CTOE in Lamego, the CCE were the first Portuguese troops to wear the brown beret and camouflage combat uniform in combat.

The term Golden Age comes from Greek mythology, particularly the Works and Days of Hesiod, and is part of the description of temporal decline of the state of peoples through five Ages, Gold being the first and the one during which the Golden Race of humanity ( chrýseon génos). lived. After the end of the first age was the Silver, then the Bronze, after this the Heroic age, with the fifth and current age being Iron.Robin Hard - The Routledge Handbook of Greek Mythology: Based on H.J. Rose's \\"Handbook of Greek Mythology\\", p.69-70, Psychology Press, 2004 , Accessed 2017-06-May By extension, \\"Golden Age\\" denotes a period of primordial peace, harmony, stability, and prosperity. During this age, peace and harmony prevailed in that people did not have to work to feed themselves for the earth provided food in abundance. They lived to a very old age with a youthful appearance, eventually dying peacefully, with spirits living on as \\"guardians\\". Plato in Cratylus (397 e) recounts the golden race of humans who came first. He clarifies that Hesiod did not mean literally made of gold, but good and noble. In classical Greek mythology, the Golden Age was presided over by the leading Titan Cronus. In some versions of the myth Astraea also ruled. She lived with men until the end of the Silver Age. But in the Bronze Age, when men became violent and greedy, she fled to the stars, where she appears as the constellation Virgo, holding the scales of Justice, or Libra.\\"Hesiod calls [Astraea] the daughter of Jove and Themis. Aratus says that she is thought to be the daughter of Astraeus and Aurora, who lived at the time of the Golden Age of men and was their leader. On account of her carefulness and fairness she was called Justice, and at that time no foreign nations were attacked in war, nor did anyone sail over the seas, but they were wont to live their lives caring for their fields. But those born after their death began to be less observant of duty and more greedy, so that Justice associated more rarely with men. Finally the disease became so extreme that it was said the Brazen Race was born; then she could not endure more, and flew away to the stars.\\" (Gaius Julius Hyginus, Astronomica 2). European pastoral literary tradition often depicted nymphs and shepherds as living a life of rustic innocence and peace, set in Arcadia, a region of Greece that was the abode and center of worship of their tutelary deity, goat-footed Pan, who dwelt among them.Bridget Ann Henish, The Medieval Calendar Year (), p. 96. The Golden Age in Europe: Greece The earliest attested reference to the European myth of the Ages of Man 500 BCE–350 BCE appears in the late 6th century BCE works of the Greek poet Hesiod's Works and Days (109–126). Hesiod, a deteriorationist, identifies the Golden Age, the Silver Age, the Bronze Age, the Heroic Age, and the Iron Age. With the exception of the Heroic Age, each succeeding age was worse than the one that went before. Hesiod maintains that during the Golden Age, before the invention of the arts, the earth produced food in such abundance that there was no need for agriculture: > [Men] lived like gods without sorrow of heart, remote and free from toil and > grief: miserable age rested not on them; but with legs and arms never > failing they made merry with feasting beyond the reach of all devils. When > they died, it was as though they were overcome with sleep, and they had all > good things; for the fruitful earth unforced bare them fruit abundantly and > without stint. They dwelt in ease and peace. Plato in his Cratylus referred to an age of golden men and also at some length on Ages of Man from Hesiod's Works and Days. The Roman poet Ovid simplified the concept by reducing the number of Ages to four: Gold, Bronze, Silver, and Iron. Ovid's poetry was likely a prime source for the transmission of the myth of the Golden Age during the period when Western Europe had lost direct contact with Greek literature. The Golden Age (c. 1530) by Lucas Cranach the Elder. In Hesiod's version, the Golden Age ended when the Titan Prometheus conferred on mankind the gift of fire and all the other arts. For this, Zeus punished Prometheus by chaining him to a rock in the Caucasus, where an eagle eternally ate at his liver. The gods sent the beautiful maiden Pandora to Prometheus's brother Epimetheus. The gods had entrusted Pandora with a box that she was forbidden to open; however, her uncontrollable curiosity got the better of her and she opened the box, thereby unleashing all manner of evil into the world. Robert Willemsz de Baudous: Golden Age, etching, cca 1598. The Orphic school, a mystery cult that originated in Thrace and spread to Greece in the 5th century BCE, held similar beliefs about the early days of man, likewise denominating the ages with metals. In common with the many other mystery cults prevalent in the Graeco-Roman world (and their Indo-European religious antecedents), the world view of Orphism was cyclical. Initiation into its secret rites, together with ascetic practices, was supposed to guarantee the individual's soul eventual release from the grievous circle of mortality and also communion with god(s). Orphics sometimes identified the Golden Age with the era of the god Phanes, who was regent over the Olympus before Cronus. In classical mythology however, the Golden Age was associated with the reign of Saturn. In the 5th century BCE, the philosopher Empedocles, like Hesiod before him, emphasized the idea of primordial innocence and harmony in all of nature, including human society, from which he maintained there had been a steady deterioration until the present. =Arcadia= A tradition arose in Greece that the site of the original Golden Age had been Arcadia, an impoverished rural area of Greece where the herdsmen still lived on acorns and where the goat-footed god Pan had his home among the poplars on Mount Maenalus. However, in the 3rd century BCE, the Greek poet, Theocritus, writing in Alexandria, set his pastoral poetry in on the lushly fertile island of Sicily, where he had been born. The protagonist of Theocritus's first Idyll, the goat herder, Daphnis, is taught to play the Syrinx (panpipes) by Pan himself. Pan teaching Daphnis to play the pipes; c. 100 BCE Found in Pompeii. The Golden Age in Rome: Virgil and Ovid Writing in Latin during the turbulent period of revolutionary change at the end of the Roman Republic (roughly between 44 and 38 BCE), the poet Virgil moved the setting for his pastoral imitations of Theocritus back to an idealized Arcadia in Greece, thus initiating a rich and resonant tradition in subsequent European literature. Virgil, moreover, introduced into his poetry the element of political allegory, which had been largely absent in Theocritus, even intimating in his fourth Eclogue that a new Golden Age of peace and justice was about to return: Ultima Cumaei venit iam carminis aetas; magnus ab integro saeclorum nascitur ordo: iam redit et Virgo, redeunt Saturnia regna; iam nova progenies caelo demittitur alto. Translation: Now the last age by Cumae's Sibyl sung Has come and gone, and the majestic roll Of circling centuries begins anew: Astraea returns, Returns old Saturn's reign, With a new breed of men sent down from heaven.Eclogue (lines 5-8) Somewhat later, shortly before he wrote his epic poem the Aeneid, which dealt with the establishment of Roman Imperial rule, Virgil composed his Georgics (29 BCE), modeled directly on Hesiod's Works and Days and similar Greek works. Ostensibly about agriculture, the Georgics are in fact a complex allegory about how man's alterations of nature (through works) are related to good and bad government. Although Virgil does not mention the Golden Age by name in the Georgics, he does refer in them to a time of primitive communism before the reign of Jupiter, when: Fields knew no taming hand of husbandmen To mark the plain or mete with boundary-line. Even this was impious; for the common stock They gathered, and the earth of her own will All things more freely, no man bidding, bore. ante Iouem nulli subigebant arua coloni ne signare quidem aut partiri limite campum fas erat; in medium quaerebant, ipsaque tellus omnia liberius nullo poscente ferebat. (Georgics, Book 1: 125–28) This view, which identifies a State of Nature with the celestial harmony of which man's nature is (or should be, if properly regulated) a microcosm, reflects the Hellenistic cosmology that prevailed among literate classes of Virgil's era. It is seen again in Ovid's Metamorphoses (7 CE), in which the lost Golden Age is depicted as a place and time when, because nature and reason were harmoniously aligned, men were naturally good: The Golden Age was first; when Man, yet new, No rule but uncorrupted Reason knew: And, with a native bent, did good pursue. Unforc'd by punishment, un-aw'd by fear. His words were simple, and his soul sincere; Needless was written law, where none opprest: The law of Man was written in his breast.Ovid's Metamorphoses, Book the First, eighteenth century version, \\"Translated into English verse under the direction of Sir Samuel Garth by John Dryden, Alexander Pope, Joseph Addison, William Congreve, and other eminent hands. The Graeco-Roman concept of the \\"natural man\\" delineated by Ovid and many other classical writers, was especially popular during the Deistically inclined 18th century. It is often erroneously attributed to Rousseau, who did not share it.See A. O. Lovejoy's essay on \\"The Supposed Primitivism of Rousseau's Discourse on Inequality\\" in Essays in the History of Ideas (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Press, 1948, 1960) \\"Soft\\" and \\"hard\\" primitivism in Arcadia In his famous essay, \\"Et in Arcadia ego: Poussin and the Elegiac Tradition\\",\\"Et in Arcadia ego: Poussin and the Elegiac Tradition,\\" in Meaning in the Visual Arts (New York: Doubleday, 1955) pp. 297–98. Erwin Panofsky remarks how in ancient times, \\"that particular not overly opulent, region of central Greece, Arcady, came to be universally accepted as an ideal realm of perfect bliss and beauty, a dream incarnate of ineffable happiness, surrounded nevertheless with a halo of 'sweetly sad' melancholy\\": > There had been, from the beginning of classical speculation, two contrasting > opinions about the natural state of man, each of them, of course, a \\"Gegen- > Konstruktion\\" to the conditions under which it was formed. One view, termed > \\"soft\\" primitivism in an illuminating book by Lovejoy and BoasA.O. Lovejoy > and G. Boas, Primitivism and Related Ideas in Antiquity (Baltimore: Johns > Hopkins Press, 1935). conceives of primitive life as a golden age of plenty, > innocence, and happiness – in other words, as civilized life purged of its > vices. The other, \\"hard\\" form of primitivism conceives of primitive life as > an almost subhuman existence full of terrible hardships and devoid of all > comforts – in other words, as civilized life stripped of its virtues. > Arcady, as we encounter it in all modern literature, and as we refer to it > in our daily speech, falls under the heading of “soft\\" or golden-age > primitivism. To be sure, this real Arcady was the domain of Pan, who could > be heard playing the syrinx on Mount Maenalus; and its inhabitants were > famous for their musical accomplishments as well as for their ancient > lineage, rugged virtue, and rustic hospitality. Other Golden Ages There are analogous concepts in the religious and philosophical traditions of the South Asian subcontinent. For example, the Vedic or ancient Hindu culture saw history as cyclical, each cycle composed of four yugas (ages)—Satya Yuga (Golden Age), Treta Yuga (Silver Age), Dvapara Yuga (Bronze Age) and Kali Yuga (Iron Age)—correspond to the four Greek ages. Similar beliefs occur in the ancient Middle East and throughout the ancient world, as well.Richard Heinberg (1989). Memories and Visions of Paradise: Exploring the Universal Myth of a Lost Golden Age Los Angeles, Calif.: Tarcher. 282 pp. . =Hindu= The Indian teachings differentiate the four world ages (Yugas) not according to metals, but according to dharmic qualities (virtues), where the first age starts with the most and the last age ends with the least. The end is followed by a new cycle of the same four ages: Satya Yuga (golden age), Treta Yuga, Dvapara Yuga, and Kali Yuga (dark age), of which we are currently in Kali Yuga.Matsya Purana In Satya Yuga, knowledge, meditation, and communion with spirit hold special importance. Most people engage only in good, sublime deeds and mankind lives in harmony with the Earth. Ashrams become devoid of wickedness and deceit. Natyam (such as Bharatanatyam), according to Natya Shastra, did not exist in the Satya Yuga \\"because it was the time when all people were happy\\". Satya Yuga ( Krita Yuga) according to Mahabharata: > Men neither bought nor sold; there were no poor and no rich; there was no > need to labour, because all that men required was obtained by the power of > will; the chief virtue was the abandonment of all worldly desires. The Krita > Yuga was without disease; there was no lessening with the years; there was > no hatred or vanity, or evil thought whatsoever; no sorrow, no fear. All > mankind could attain to supreme blessedness. =Norse= The Old Norse word gullaldr (literally \\"Golden Age\\") was used in Völuspá to describe the period after Ragnarök, where the surviving gods and their progeny build the city Gimlé on the ruins of Asgard. In this period, Baldr reigns. =Bible= There is a reference to a succession of kingdoms in Nebuchadnezzar's dream in Daniel 2, in decreasing order identified as gold, silver, bronze, iron and finally mixed iron and clay. The interpretation of the dream follows in verses 36–45. =Fantasy= In modern fantasy worlds, whose background and setting sometimes draw heavily on real-world myths, similar or compatible concepts of a Golden Age exist in the said world's prehistory; when deities or elf-like creatures existed, before the coming of humans. For example, in The Silmarillion by J. R. R. Tolkien, a Golden Age exists in Middle-earth legendarium. Arda (the part of the world where The Lord of the Rings is set), was designed to be symmetrical and perfect. After the wars of the Gods, Arda lost its perfect shape (known as Arda Unmarred) and was called Arda Marred. Another kind of 'Golden Age' follows later, after the Elves awoke; the Eldar stay on Valinor, live with the Valar and advance in arts and knowledge, until the rebellion and the fall of the Noldor, reminiscent of the Fall of Man. Eventually, after the end of the world, the Silmarilli will be recovered and the light of the Two Trees of Valinor rekindled. Arda will be remade again as Arda Healed. In The Wheel of Time universe, the \\"Age of Legends\\" is the name given to the previous Age: In this society, channelers were common and Aes Sedai – trained channelers – were extremely powerful, able to make angreal, sa'angreal, and ter'angreal, and holding important civic positions. The Age of Legends is seen as a utopian society without war or crime, and devoted to culture and learning. Aes Sedai were frequently devoted to academic endeavours, one of which inadvertently resulted in a hole – The Bore – being drilled in the Dark One's prison. The immediate effects were not realised, but the Dark One gradually asserted power over humanity, swaying many to become his followers. This resulted in the War of Power and eventually the Breaking of the World. Another example is in the background of the Lands of Lore classic computer game, where the history of the Lands is divided in Ages. One of them is also called the Golden Age, a time when the Lands were ruled by the 'Ancients', and there were no wars. This age ended with the 'War of the Heretics'. The Golden Age may also refer to a state of early childhood. Herbert Spencer argued that young children progress through the cognitive stages of evolution of the human species and of human civilization, thereby linking pre-civilization and infancy. Kenneth Grahame called his evocation of early childhood The Golden Age and J. M. Barrie's fictional character Peter Pan, who first appeared in The Little White Bird was named after Pan, a Greek god from the Golden Age. Barrie's further works about Peter Pan depict early childhood as a time of pre-civilised naturalness and happiness, which is destroyed by the subsequent process of education. =Present-day usage= The term \\"Golden Age\\" is at present frequently used in the context of various fields, such as the \\"Spanish Golden Age\\", \\"Dutch Golden Age\\", \\"Golden Age of Flanders, \\"Golden age of alpinism\\", \\"Golden Age of American animation\\", \\"Golden Age of Comics\\", \\"Golden Age of Science Fiction\\", \\"Golden Age of Television\\", \\"Golden Age of Hollywood\\", \\"Golden age of arcade video games\\", \\"Golden Age of Radio\\", \\"Golden Age of Hip Hop\\" and even \\"Golden Age of Piracy\\" or \\"Golden Age of Porn\\". Usually, the term \\"Golden Age\\" is bestowed retroactively, when the period in question has ended and is compared with what followed in the specific field discussed. The term has also been used prospectively. For example, on July 27, 2020, the President of the United States, Donald Trump, published a tweet promising a future \\"golden age\\" once we \\"beat the virus\\".

The school was divided into two departments: preparatory (for ages nine and up) and collegiate. The curriculum was based on physical education, sciences, and classical studies Rock Hill College was founded in 1824 as Rock Hill Academy and purchased in 1857 by the Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools (known as the Christian Brothers); Rock Hill College is sometimes referred in older publications as the Christian Brothers College. In 1865 The College was incorporated as Howard County's only college and construction of the four-story stone building was completed. During the Civil War, the college basement served as a hospital for Northern and Southern troops. In 1866, Brother Azarias (Patrick Francis Mullany) was called to be a professor of mathematics and literature at Rock Hill College. He was President of Rock Hill from 1879 to 1886. Baltimore architect George A. Frederick was involved in the architectural design of Rock Hill College. Classes included Greek and Latin. Though not a parochial school, St. Paul's Catholic Church in Ellicott City created a chapel for the students of Rock Hill College in 1859. The side chapel eventually became part of the church proper. The building was destroyed by fire on 16 January 1923 while most were in attendance at a basketball game. A chimney fire spread to the dormitory roof, burning all but the gymnasium. The school merged with Calvert Hall College High School in Baltimore.

Rukavina was a member of the International Brigades and prominent Croatian and Yugoslav communist. He was a Partisan in World War II in Yugoslavia with a rank of general. After the war he was Deputy of the Minister of Defence of Yugoslavia and held various military high positions. He also supported Croatian Spring in the early 1970s and after the collapse of Yugoslavia he participated in founding of Croatian People's Party in 1990. Pre-war life Rukavina was born in Otočac in Lika region, today's Croatia in noble family. He attended gymnasium in Gračac and Otočac and finished last class in Zagreb. After the gymnasium he became a medical student at the University of Zagreb. He joined to SKOJ in 1933 after he contacted with other communist sympathizers at the university. As a member of SKOJ he was arrested few times. In 1934 he went to emigration, first he went to Vienna, and then, in 1935 to Prague when he became a member of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia. From 1935 to 1935 he worked in \\"Tehnika KPJ\\", a small printing house in Prague which planned to publish communist the newspaper \\"Proleter\\". In time of preparation of conference of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia in Prague, he was arrested again, but soon released. In December 1936 he joined Spanish Republican Army and participated in Spanish Civil War. During the first stages of war he was a sergeant in Dimitrov Battalion. Soon he raised to rank of a captain and became commander of the Đuro Đaković Battalion. After Nationalist took control over Catalonia, Rukavina fled with rest of republican soldiers to France and was interned to a POW camp. Soon he escaped from the camp and returned to Yugoslavia. After he returned, he again became an active member of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia in Zagreb; he was especially active in SKOJ. Soon he became a member of the Regional Committee of the SKOJ in Croatia. World War II in Yugoslavia During the April War, when Nazi Germany attacked Kingdom of Yugoslavia, he was a conscript in Nikšić. After Yugoslav capitulation he was in an Italian POW camp. After 15 days spent in POW camp, he escaped to Zagreb, and again he joined the activity of the Communist Party. During the first stages of rebellion he became a member of the Military Committee for Croatia in May 1941. In June 1941 he went to Banija and participated in foundation of Sisak People's Liberation Partisan Detachment. After that, Rukavina returned to Zagreb, which was the capital of the Independent State of Croatia at the time, and at the beginning of August 1941 he went to Kordun where he also worked on the founding of partisan detachments. In November 1941 he became Chief of the General Staff of Croatia. He served in that role until 1943 when he became the commander of the 4th (Croatian) Corps of the Yugoslav Partisans.

Dating from circa 7,000–7,800 BCE, Baker Cave is a part of a system of rock shelters in the Lower Pecos Canyons region and was 120 feet long by 56 feet deep (37 m × 17 m). The ceiling varied from at the mouth to just a few inches in the back. These sites are common in the limestone formations in the Lower Pecos region. The site was perched well above the flood, preserving the materials that ancient peoples had left behind. A large cooking hearth was found inside it, dating to around 9,000 years ago, and containing small creatures such as snakes, rats, fish, and rabbits, and a wide variety of seeds and nuts, indicating a diversified diet.\\"Lower Pecos Canyonland.\\" Texas Beyond History. (May 2008) The recovery of a complete Golondrina point established Paleo-Indian residence in Baker Cave. They were estimated, by radiocarbon dating, to have been there sometime between 7080 BCE and 6960 BCE. These dates are older and not consistent with other sites in the area. Potential contamination of the charcoal tested could have led to this difference in dates. The people at Baker Cave had an archaic life and lived off small game and foraging. The mouth of the cave was primarily used for cooking, the middle of everyday life routine, and the rear of the cave for food processing. No further research has been done on Baker Cave; however, the Lower Pecos Region of Texas has numerous other cave excavations ongoing. History The site was named after the Baker family, who owned the land and allowed archaeological research in the shelter.Word and Douglas 1. The Baker family had protected the site from looters, as did its isolated location. The first fieldwork began in April 1962, by archaeologists from the University of Texas at Austin's Archaeology Research Lab, who designated the shelter 41 VV 213. James H. Word directed the majority of the archaeological investigation together with University of Texas archaeologists E. Mott Davis and T.N. Campbell. The Texas Memorial Museum also sent Mr. Curtis Tunnel and Texas Technological College sent Mr. John W. Greer and Dr. David R. Kelley. Mrs. Anne Fox from the Witte Memorial Museum was also on the project team. Many volunteers also donated their time and skills. Significance Baker Cave was significant in the fact it was completely undisturbed at the start of the excavations. The top layers yielded debatage from the Early Archaic and the Late Archaic. The earliest deposits were late Paleo-Indian projectile points of the Plainview Golondrina type. Charcoal from the early deposits were radiocarbon dated to 8910 BP and 9030 BP. Also, a large cooking hearth feature was found. The bones in the hearth included snakes, rats, fish, rabbits, and other small animals, which showed that people used everything possibly available. These dietary indicators were discovered because flotation procedures were used, a very early example of the use of this technique. Roughly 10,000 bones were found during the excavation of Baker Cave. One-third of the bones were fish, while the other two-thirds were mammalian and reptilian. Many of the fragments were tiny and could not be assigned to a specific genus. Also, many of the bones showed charring, some of this occurred during cooking and sometimes it occurred when they were trying to get rid of the bones they no longer needed. Oddly enough, rabbit bones were almost always charred while rat bones were never charred, which could be due to cooking methods.Word and Douglas 147. The cave has an unblackened roof, which may be due to rapid spalling of the roofs or updrafting winds acting as a vent and carrying smoke out of the cave. Techniques In the northernmost part of the shelter, on a large roof spall, a datum point was set up. From this datum point, the shelter was grided out into units that were wide. Excavation of the first unit was for test purposes. Depth of deposits, nature of occupational deposits, and the stratification patterns were determined so future units could be dug by strata. Deposits from this unit were screened through quarter-inch mesh with artifacts labeled by unit and level in which they were recovered. All flint, bone, shell, and wood were kept; only samples of vegetal matter were retained because the amount to keep was too large.Word and Douglas 8. Unit 2 was dug second, and lay just south of unit 1. Unit 3 began next because the landowners requested it. Soon after, unit 6 was opened up in the extreme rear of the cave, from the back corner of unit 1. Unit 6 was used to determine difference in usage from the back of the cave to the front. At first, units were dug in , until strata and deposits became more clear and easy to follow. The strata were numbered according to a system that was used for the entire project. However, the strata were not continuous through all of the units, and often split into two strata in adjacent units. Because of this, some of the strata were grouped into zones. The researchers defined zones as \\"a major division distinguishable from other soil units on the basis of rather distinct changes in soil color, content, and texture\\".Word and Douglas 10. Five zones, plus the surface, were in the excavation. Zones Zone one (7500–6500 BCE), starting from the top, included two strata near the front of the shelter. It consisted of limestone that was thick. However, towards the back of the shelter, zone one contained a third stratum that was distinguished by a sterile line of deposits. Zone one contained some fire-cracked hearthstones, large flint debris, rodent bones, some cracked deer bone, and near the middle of the cave, late Paleo-Indian points were recovered. Units 6, 9, 10, and 14 in zone one, contained a higher level of charcoal, some fine and some in lumps. Zone two (6500–4000 BCE) contained a greater variation of strata than zone one. Unit 1 only had one stratum, but units 7, 8, 9, 10, and 14 consisted of three strata and a lens in zone two, and unit 6 had two strata. The top portions of zone two do not show signs of fire, but they do show signs of decay, which would indicate moisture in the soil. Vegetal matter was a little less sparse, only mescal bean hulls and the hulls of pecans, walnuts, and acorns were found. Flint chips and charcoal were also found, but smaller in size than zone one. The rodent bones decreased throughout this zone, but the frequency of large animal bones, like deer, increased. Lithic artifacts also increased in zone two. Zone three (4000–2500 BCE) had a marked lower level of moisture than zone two. Hearth rocks and small roof spalls are common in this zone. Small flint scrap, quids, prickly pear leaves, mescal beans, pecans, walnuts, and acorns were also present. Fibrous and lithic artifacts were found along with an increase in rodents and birds and a decrease in deer. Zone three also had a white ash lens in units 6, 9, and 10. The assumed thought of occurrence is a large fire. In unit 6, a second lens is present under the first, probably from higher heat intensity. Zone four (2500–1000 BCE) has a very diverse set of strata. Unit 1 consisted of three strata with the lowest being intense fire-cracked rock and ash. The upper two strata have high charcoal levels and these layers feel greasy. Two strata make up units 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 14. Also, a lens was found in units 14, 10, and 9. This lens has ashy tan soil and a great deal of fibrous materials. The lithics in this zone are mainly fire-fractured, and deer, rodent, and fish bones have been found also. The soil in this zone is representative of localized fires. An overall increase in lithic, bone, and fibrous artifacts was noted in this zone. Zone five (1000 BCE–1000 CE) contains three strata through all of the units and contains much fiber. Fiber artifacts were more numerous than the other artifacts found, such as fire-cracked rock, mesquite beans, mescal beans, leaves, pecans, walnuts, persimmon seeds, pods of sotol, sacahuista, and lechuguilla. Knotted fibers were commonly found along with woven fibers. In units 6, 8, and 10, charcoal was found; also in unit 6, a large fiber lens was noted. The surface was tentatively dated 1000–1600 CE. Features During the excavations at Baker Cave, many features were found, including hearths. Most of the hearths were round and bowl-shaped. Their size ranged from on the long axis and on the short axis. Feature number one was found in unit 2 in the top layer of zone five. It was a mass of grass bound with twigs that measured 4.08 in thick, 9.67 in long and 7.0 in wide (10.4 cm × 24.6 cm × 18 cm). Feature number two was located under a boulder in unit 3 and zone four. It was an antler from a whitetail deer that looked to have been intentionally placed under the boulder. Feature three was an unused pit and 12 pear internodes that had been tied with split sacahuista. The pit measured . The pear internodes were stacked in layers and bundled northwest of the unused pit; they were located in zone five. Feature four contained 53 sotol or lechuguilla flower stalks and spread across units 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13. These stalks are believed to have been the base for a screen, which could have served as a backrest for occupants. Feature five was located in unit 9 and zone three. It was a small pit measuring 4.5 by 3.5 in and about 2.9 in deep (11 cm × 8.9 cm × 7.4 cm). It was also filled with flint and broken bifaces. Features six and seven were combined because they were both bowl-shaped pits in the same unit. They were mainly in unit 13 and spread into unit 9. Both pits were filled with fiber, and they seemingly were intended to be hearths. Lastly, feature number eight was the burial that was later discovered by Jim Baker. It was located behind unit 12, and the bones were about below the surface. The skull fragments were from an infant. References Further reading *Word, James H. and C. L.

The sinking is the only incident where one submarine sank another in combat while both were at periscope depth.U864: Hitler's Deadly Last Secret, Discovery Communications, 2006 Background U-864 was a Type IX U-boat on a covert mission, Operation Caesar, to the Empire of Japan. p. 8 On 6 February 1945, U-864 passed through the Fedje area (off the coast of Norway) without being detected. During this transit, a normally quiet engine began making an abnormally loud and rhythmic noise that could be easily detected by any anti- submarine (A/S) detection gear in the area. There were many Allied (primarily British) ships, submarines and aircraft in the area on anti-submarine patrol. U-864s commander, Ralf-Reimar Wolfram, decided to return to the pens at Bergen to repair the engine. By this stage of the war the German machine cypher, Enigma, had been broken by the British and was being decrypted, and the Royal Navy were concerned the secret cargo might enable the Japanese to extend the duration of the war in the Pacific. They dispatched Venturer to intercept and destroy U-864. Venturer, under the command of Lieutenant Jimmy Launders, received a brief message from the Admiralty (probably Rear Admiral Submarines) as to the estimated whereabouts of U-864, along with instructions to destroy her. Launders set about the task, making one risky decision: he decided to switch off Venturers ASDIC (active sonar) and rely solely on hydrophones, to try to detect U-864 without being detected. Wolfram's decision to return for repairs at the U-boat pens at Bergen to fix the abnormal engine noise problem brought U-864 back past Fedje and the area where Venturer was located. The Action As Venturer continued her patrol of the waters around Fedje, her hydrophone operator noticed a strange sound which he could not identify. He thought that the noise sounded as though some local fisherman had started up a boat's diesel engine. Launders decided to track the strange noise. Then the officer of the watch on Venturer's periscope noticed what they thought was another periscope above the surface of the water. It is highly likely he had, in fact, spotted the U-boats snorkel. The snorkel was still a new device at that time and probably unknown to Launders and his crew. The snorkel limited the U-boat's speed and depth. For Launders' hydrophone operator to hear diesel noises from a submerged U-boat, the snorkel would have had to be in operation. In addition, the noise of the diesel engines made the U-boat's own hydrophones much less effective and it is doubtful U-864 would have heard Venturer running slowly on her electric motors. Combined with the hydrophone reports of the strange noise, which he determined to be coming from a submerged vessel, Launders surmised they had found U-864. He tracked the U-boat by hydrophone, hoping she would surface and allow a clear shot. U-864 remained at snorkel depth, and as the hydrophone plot emerged, she was seen to be zigzagging. This made the German submarine quite safe according to the assumptions of the time. It is very likely Launders tracked the U-boat's snorkel by periscope as well, which would greatly improve the accuracy of his fire control solution. Launders tracked the U-boat for several hours, and it became obvious she was not going to surface, but he needed to attack her anyway – his batteries had only a limited life. It was theoretically possible to compute a firing solution in all four dimensions – time, distance, bearing and target depth – but this had never been attempted in practice because it was assumed that performing the complex calculations would be impossible, plus there were unknown factors that had to be approximated. In most torpedo attacks, the target would have been visually acquired; the target's angle relative to the attacker and its bearing would be observed, then a rangefinder in the periscope used to establish the distance to the target; from this speed could be derived, and a basic mechanical computer would offset the aiming point for the torpedo. In addition, any torpedo depth had to be set based on target identification. Too deep and the torpedo would pass under the target, too shallow (in this instance) it would miss above. Launders could only estimate the depth of his target. In terms of a challenge, this was far outside what they had trained for, as they tried to manoeuvre into a firing position without giving their own position away by creating excessive noise, or exhausting their own batteries. Nevertheless, Launders made the necessary calculations, made assumptions about U-864's defensive manoeuvres, and ordered the firing of all four of his bow torpedo tubes. The torpedoes were fired with a 17.5 second delay between each pair, and at variable depths. U-864 attempted to evade once it heard the torpedoes coming, but was not agile when diving or turning; additionally, time would have been needed to retract the snorkel, disengage the diesel, and start the electric motors. The fourth torpedo hit. Her pressure hull punctured, U-864 instantaneously imploded with the loss of all hands. Aftermath Location of U-864 U-864 sank from the relative safety of the U-boat pens in Bergen. Launders was awarded a bar to his DSO for this action, while several members of Venturers crew were decorated by the Royal Navy.

Early life He was born in Colchester, the son of a barrister, the Jamaican born Robert Charles Dallas (1754–1824). His grandfather, Dr. Robert Charles Dallas (1710–1769), was a doctor who amassed a fortune in Jamaica. Dallas was educated at home to age 11, and then at a school in Kennington. Through his father, he became a clerk in the Treasury, in 1805. He went on to be a supplies officer during the Peninsular War. He was present at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815.} Dallas married in 1818. He entered the Middle Temple to study law in 1819. He left soon, and in 1820 matriculated at Worcester College, Oxford, at age 28. There he encountered evangelicals, and did not complete a degree. He was ordained a deacon and then a priest in the Church of England in 1821, and became curate of Radley. Missionary Work He began his mission to Ireland in 1843 and he famously established the controversial Irish Church Missions to Roman Catholics on 28 March 1849, which set up a number of Churches, schools, missions and orphanages. Officially he held the post Honorary Secretary of the Irish Church Missions. The Irish church missions was seen as proselytising during the Irish Famine, and for being Soupers. In the west of Ireland particularly Galway his evangelistic zeal and aggressive approach caused much conflict in the community. He moved for a while to Castlekirke on Lough Corrib where he set up a school. He had his sermons translated from English to the Irish Language for the native population. Rev. Dallas and the ICM entered into partnership with the Irish Society for Promoting the Education of the Native Irish through the Medium of Their Own Language. In the west, Rev. Dallas' anti-catholic tirades caused much bitterness within the Irish Society, with the Dublin University branch opposing the alliance. One of his supporters in Dublin was Ellen Smyly the philanthropist who had set up schools and homes in Dublin, the Smyly Homes. His friends included many prominent Irish Protestants including members of the Guinness family. His attitudes and inspiration for his missions could have been due to his belief in Premillennialism or Millennialism, and the famine was a portent. Also that the practice of Catholicism was responsible for poverty and disorder. Personal life At Morden, Surrey on 4 May 1818 Dallas married Mary Anne Ferguson, widow of James Edge, with whom he had two daughters and four sons. His first wife Ann Mary died in 1847, and he married his second wife, Anne Biscoe, in 1849. Death Dallas died on 12 December 1869 in Wonston and is buried there in the churchyard. There is a monument to his memory in St. Patrick’s Cathedral, Dublin and in a church in Clifden, Connemara in Ireland, there is a commemoration regarding his efforts with the Irish Church Mission, with the inscription laboured prayerfully for the salvation of the perishing Roman Catholics of Ireland. Following his death his wife published a memoir to him. Famous relatives He was the nephew of US Treasury Secretary Alexander J. Dallas and was the first cousin of the US Senator and vice president George M. Dallas. He was the maternal grandfather of Edward Seymour, 16th Duke of Somerset. His Father was related by marriage to Lord Byron and a friend of his. Alexander compiled a book of recollections and correspondence between his father and Lord Byron.

Retrieved January 16, 2017. In 2011, NXP introduced the GreenChip smart lighting solution—including the GreenChip iCFL for compact fluorescent lamps and the GreenChip iSSL for LEDs—to enable quick start times, dimming, extended lifetimes, and wireless connectivity via IPv4 or IPv6 using JenNet-IP network layer software.By Christopher Trout, engadget. “GreenChip lighting lets you flip the switch remotely, thumbs nose at IPv4 depletion.” May 17, 2011. Retrieved January 16, 2017. History The TEA1504 was the first IC to bear the GreenChip name. Released in 1998, it was an SMPS controller with integrated standby burst mode aimed at CRT monitor applications. Improvements to standby behavior meant the chip realized a < 3 W consumption (the Energy Star target at the time), without needing a separate standby power supply. The second generation GreenChip II products appeared in 2000 with the release of the TEA1507, a quasi resonant flyback SMPS controller targeted at standby power savings in monitors, TVs and VCRs.By ElectronicsWeekly. “Philips 'green' power controller gets greener.” November 15, 2000. Retrieved January 16, 2017. It could achieve a standby performance of < 1 W and boasted efficiency improvements well beyond 90%. The IC was built in close cooperation with Philips CE TV and was included in the designs of numerous TV manufacturers. In 2002/2003, the GreenChip II TEA155x series was released. Derived from the TEA1507, the new series was specifically aimed at notebook adapters. The GreenChip II series was capable of reducing notebook adapter no-load power to below 500 mW (a 100% improvement on the state-of-the-art 1 W at that time). It also improved system robustness by integrating more adapter specific protections and signaling conditioning functionality. The TEA155x grew to take a dominant share in the notebook adapter market. The third generation GreenChip III arrived in 2007 with the launch of the TEA1750.By Paul OShea, EE Times. “Third gen chip reduces standby power in notebooks.” March 6, 2007. Retrieved January 16, 2017. It established market leadership in the high power and high efficiency notebook and 75-250 W computing markets. GreenChip III combines an SMPS controller with an active PFC pre-conditioner to deliver a highly integrated solution with minimal external components. TEA175x achieves < 300 mW no-load performance, with typical efficiency levels at or beyond 90% over the power supply’s complete operating range. GreenChip III is used in the power adapters of notebook PCs, power supplies for small PCs and all-in-one integrated systems like the iMac. The GreenChip SR, a secondary control IC for notebook adapters, was launched in 2006 with the TEA176x family.\\"Philips chipset claims power efficiency boost\\", EE Times, March 20, 2006. Retrieved July 3, 2011. The GreenChip SR family was extended in 2009 with the TEA179x family. GreenChip SR is a control circuit for the output stage of power supplies. By replacing diode rectifiers with active MOSFET rectification, GreenChip SR enabled typical loss reductions of 20-30%. In 2006, Philips also introduced the GreenChip PC, a chipset featuring a new topology designed to increase the overall efficiency of desktop PC power supplies to more than 80 percent; at the time, most desktop PC power supplies were only 60 to 70 percent efficient when operating. The GreenChip PC was based on patented Philips technology integrating the standby supply into the main converter, reducing the number of external components required. Addressing 10-70 W class power supplies, the TEA173x GreenChip Low Power generation was launched towards the end of 2009. The TEA173x targeted high volume computing (netbook, printer, monitor) and consumer (STB, DVD, Blu-ray, audio) applications. The GreenChip Low Power series enabled efficiencies of up to 90% and standby performances of less than 100 mW. GreenChip Resonant ICs such as the TEA1713, launched in early 2010, extend the higher end of the Greenchip portfolio. They feature a resonant converter capable of being applied from 90-600 W and delivering efficiencies of over 95%. They are suitable for a broad range of applications including LCD TV and high efficiency computing power like high density travel adapters. 2010 also saw the advent of GreenChip ICs for lamps. These enable the creation of compact energy-saving CFL bulbs that resemble the familiar incandescent bulbs. GreenChip lighting ICs offer a number of benefits over other solutions including greater reliability (extended lifetimes), faster start-up, dimming capability and low noise operation. Technology The first and second generation of GreenChip ICs used a combination of High Voltage DMOS and more dense BiCMOS for control in multi-chip configurations. In the second generation and after, BiCMOS was replaced by the A-BCD2 (Advanced Bipolar CMOS DMOS 2) process.

She sold the US Dessange franchises to Dessange Paris Group to focus on her role as First Lady of Côte d'Ivoire and to her foundation, Children of Africa.  Activism  =Children of Africa Foundation= In 1980, Folloroux-Ouattara conducted humanitarian missions in Côte d'Ivoire and in 1998 she established the Children Of Africa Foundation. The Foundations' goal is the welfare of children on the African continent. Princess Ira von Fürstenberg is patron of the foundation, which is active in 11 countries across Africa, inckuding Côte d'Ivoire, Gabon, Madagascar, Central Africa and Burkina Faso. The Foundation focuses especially on four sectors, namely health, education, social issues and providing subsidized facilities.

The third plan is effective from 2017 to 2019. In July 2012, the US State Department released its 2012 report on trafficking in persons. The report reclassified Ivory Coast as among its tier 2 countries, which corresponds to countries that do not fully comply with the minimum standards of the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Prevention Act (TVPA), but that are making significant efforts to eliminate child labor.

The success of Louisiana's film industry caused the state to be nicknamed \\"Hollywood South\\" or \\"Hollywood on the Bayou\\".http://wayinto.com/atlanta/hollywood-of-the-south/ In 2013, by some measures, film and television production in Louisiana exceeded that of California for the first time. History =Early era= Film-making in Louisiana began in 1898 with the American Mutoscope and Biograph Company. It has been the site of several notable productions over the years, the first of which was Tarzan of the Apes, completed in 1918. Other early film productions include Jezebel, A Streetcar Named Desire, Easy Rider, Live and Let Die, and The Big Easy. Louisiana has hosted a long list of major film and television stars over the years whose reputations and talents have likely played a role in the rise of state's film industry. Some of these actors and actresses include Bette Davis, Henry Fonda, Paul Newman, Marlon Brando, Denzel Washington, John Wayne, Clint Eastwood, Julia Roberts, Dennis Hopper, Cicely Tyson, Elvis Presley, Dennis Quaid, John Goodman, Jessica Lange, Richard Pryor, Jackie Gleason, James Spader, Dolly Parton, Susan Sarandon, Tommy Lee Jones, Kevin Costner, Tom Cruise, Alec Baldwin, Yul Brenner, David Niven, Jimmy Stewart, James Mason, Brad Pitt, Charles Bronson, and Daryl Hannah. =Modern era= In 2002, Louisiana passed unique tax incentives aimed at recruiting film and television productions to the state. By 2011, the state's skilled crew base had grown by over 400 percent, and since 2006 over 300 films have been shot in Louisiana. The industry truly entered the national spotlight though when The Curious Case of Benjamin Button earned thirteen Oscar nominations, the most in 2009. In 2010, boosted by its film industry, Louisiana made its first appearance in Site Selection Magazine’s Top Business Climate rankings. In 2011 Louisiana hosted more than 150 productions and about $1.3 billion of their combined $1.9 billion in budgets was spent in the state. Tax incentives On July 1, 2002, the Louisiana Legislature enacted the Louisiana Motion Picture Tax Incentive Act. This tax credit has two primary components. First, the Investor Tax Credit provides a 30% tax credit on qualified motion picture expenditures with no project or program cap. Second, the Labor Tax Credit provides a 5% credit for payroll expenditures on Louisiana residents. This program not only encourages residents to film in Louisiana but also employ Louisiana residents. To qualify for this program, filmmakers must spend at least $300,000 in Louisiana. Climate and scenery Louisiana's warm weather and diverse locations have appealed to film producers across the country considering that the subtropical climate makes filming possible year-round without interruptions. The spring and fall months are considered ideal filming time, with October being the driest month. In terms of scenery, Louisiana offers swamps and cypress trees, public and private college campuses, antebellum plantations, and urban environments. These diverse locations are often credited for Louisiana's ability to stand in as multiple settings such as Texas, Colorado, Utah, Washington, DC, and London. As Patrick Lussier, director of Drive Angry 3D, commented in USA Today, \\"The film industry wants to find places it can reinvent and make look like anything it needs. There's a lot of opportunity [to] do that in Louisiana.\\" Current film and television projects # Bad Girls Club Season 7, (television series) # Killing Them Softly (feature film) # Ender's Game (feature film) # The Fishies (television series) # Ghostbreakers (television series) # The Host (feature film) # Super (feature film) # Hound Dogs (television series) # Looper (feature film) # Oblivion (feature film) # On the Road (feature film) # Rook (feature film) # Seven Below Zero (feature film) # Tarantula (feature film) # Treme Season 2 (television series) # True Blood (television series) # Universal Soldier: A New Dimension (feature film) Notes Economy of Louisiana Film industry Cinema of Louisiana ","title":"Film industry in Louisiana"},{"id":"31498283","text":"Benjamin Joseph Worrall (born 7 December 1975), in Swindon, Wiltshire, England, was an English footballer who played as a central midfielder in the Football League.

The gathering, held from March 2 to 6, 1919, was attended by 51 representatives of more than two dozen countries from around Europe, North America, and Asia. Convention call Late in December 1918, the leadership of the Russian Communist Party decided that the time was ripe for the convocation of a new international association of radical political parties to supplant the discredited Second International.Riddell (ed.), Founding the Communist International, pg. 7. On December 24 a radio broadcast was made from Moscow calling upon the \\"communists of all countries\\" to \\"rally around the revolutionary Third International.\\"Riddell (ed.), Founding the Communist International, pg. 8. Lenin sought to invite only those organizations which stood for a break with the more conservative elements in their group and who stood for immediate socialist revolution and the establishment of a dictatorship of the proletariat and a Soviet-style form of government. Lenin hoped for a gathering to be held beginning February 1, 1919, either openly in Berlin or, if necessary, secretly in the Netherlands. Owing to political difficulties between Soviet Russia and the rather conservative social democratic government of Germany and the eruption of civil war there, Berlin was quickly rejected as inhospitable for a foundation congress. On January 21, 1919, a meeting of about a dozen communists living in Moscow determined to hold a formal gathering in that city, to begin February 15 – little more than 3 weeks hence.Riddell (ed.), Founding the Communist International, pg. 10. The formal convention call was composed by People's Commissar of War Leon Trotsky and listed invited political organizations by name. Invited organizations from the English-speaking world included \\"the left forces in the British Socialist Party (in particular, representatives of the Maclean current)\\" (a reference to John Maclean), the British Socialist Labour Party, the Industrial Workers of the World in Britain, the Industrial Workers group in Britain, \\"revolutionary forces in the shop stewards' movement in Britain, \\"revolutionary forces in Irish workers organizations,\\" and the Industrial Workers of the World in Australia.Pervyi kongress Kominterna mart 1919 g. (The First Congress of the Comintern, March 1919). Moscow: Partiinoe izdatel'stvo, 1933, cited in Riddell (ed.), Founding the Communist International, pg. 320. In addition to these, from the United States were invited the American Socialist Labor Party, \\"left forces of the American Socialist Party (especially the current represented by the Socialist Propaganda League),\\" the Industrial Workers of the World in America, and the SLP-affiliated Workers International Industrial Union. Owing to communications difficulties ensuing from the Allied blockade, few organizations outside of Soviet Russia heard of the convention call in sufficient time to send delegates. About two dozen special messengers were said to have been sent out with the news, but only three or four managed to reach their destinations in time with the news.Riddell (ed.), Founding the Communist International, pg. 12. The call was published in the press, however, in Soviet Russia on January 24, 1919, and in Austria and Hungary by the end of the month. Transport difficulties forced a further postponement of the gathering, with the start date moved back two weeks to March 2, 1919. Despite this additional delay only two parties managed to credential delegates and to successfully get them to Moscow on time for the opening of the meeting.Riddell (ed.), Founding the Communist International, pp. 12–13. Two prospective delegates – Fritz Platten of Switzerland and Karl Steinhardt of Austria – were arrested and briefly jailed in transit.Riddell (ed.), Founding the Communist International, pp. 13–14. As a result, the vast majority of those who sat as delegates to this founding congress of the Communist International had no formal status with the parties which they claimed to represent and the delegates initially decided that the session would be a preparatory conference rather than a formal foundation convention.Riddell (ed.), Founding the Communist International, pg. 13. This initial decision was later overturned by the assembled delegates and the Third, Communist International was declared established. Delegate composition : See: List of delegates of the 1st Comintern congress. Over the six days of the congress a total of 51 delegates were registered, representing 35 organizations in 22 countries. All political tendencies in the Zimmerwald Left movement were represented at the gathering with the exception of the left wing of the International Union of Socialist Youth.Riddell, Founding the Communist International, pg. 16. Most of these delegates had already been residing in Soviet Russia, however, with only 9 of those attending the founding congress managing to break through the allied blockade of the country from abroad.John Riddell (ed.), Toward the United Front: Proceedings of the Fourth Congress of the Communist International, 1922. Lieden, Netherlands: Brill, 2012; pg. 4. With regard to the English- speaking world, no representative of the various parties and tendencies of Great Britain which were invited were in attendance at the founding congress. The only British representative present was Joseph Fineberg, a member of the British Socialist Party who had come to Soviet Russia on his own in 1918. Fineberg received only non-voting credentials as a representative of British Communists living in Russia. From the United States there was only Boris Reinstein, a Buffalo, New York member of the Socialist Labor Party of America (SLP) who had been previously sent to Europe as the party's representative to an altogether different international conclave. Although Reinstein was granted status as a voting delegate at the congress, at no time did the SLP authorize him to act as its representative at the congress and his independent action was subsequently repudiated by the organization. Dutch engineer S.J. Rutgers, at that time a resident of the United States, sat as a non-voting delegate of the Socialist Propaganda League of America as well as holding similar status on behalf of the Dutch Social Democratic Group.\\"List of Congress Delegates\\" in Riddell, Founding the Communist International, pp. 41–43. There were no delegates in attendance in either a voting or consultative status from the English-speaking countries of Canada, Australia, New Zealand, or South Africa. The nationalities outside of Europe were surprisingly well represented at the founding congress, including a group of five voting delegates from the \\"United Group of the Eastern Peoples of Russia,\\" a voting delegate from Armenia, as well as non-voting delegates from Turkey, Turkestan, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Persia, China, and Korea. In all these 13 delegates represented fully one- quarter of the 52 voting and non-voting delegates to the gathering. The largest and most influential delegation, not surprisingly, was that of Soviet Russia. In addition to the five delegates assigned as representatives of the various \\"Eastern peoples\\" of the former Russian empire, six regular and two consultative delegates were in attendance, including such key figures of the Russian Communist Party as Lenin, Trotsky, Grigori Zinoviev, Nikolai Bukharin, Georgii Chicherin, V.V. Vorovsky, and Valerian Osinsky. Although the name of Soviet People's Commissar of Nationalities Joseph Stalin also appeared on the delegate list, there is no indication that he actually participated in the congress.Riddell, Founding the Communist International, pg. 18. The delegates were, in general, younger than had been typical at previous international socialist gatherings. Of the 43 delegates for whom an age is known, 5 were in their 20s and 24 were in their 30s, with only the American Boris Reinstein over the age of 50. Congress location The Founding Convention was held at the Kremlin in Moscow in a small hall in the Courts of Justice.Riddell (ed.), Founding the Communist International, pg. 19. The long, narrow hall was barely large enough for 100 people, with the delegates seated upon flimsy chairs at small tables spaced throughout the room.

Paid for with local donations, the murals provide the community with details about some lesser- known people, businesses, and customs of the city while adding artistic beauty. The York County History Center owns and shares rights to the use of the mural images.  History  In the 1990s a group of individuals from York traveled to Chemainus, Vancouver Island, British Columbia. David Carver, the president of the York Redevelopment Committee at that time, was among the group. Chemainus had a series of murals depicting the town's history that had been successful in drawing tourism to the area. The York group was interested in viewing these murals and deciding whether a project like this would work in York. A committee was later formed and the York Mural Project was begun. There are a total of 18 large murals and a series of mini-murals. Each mural depicts the history or York and is painted on the side of a building. The first mural was painted in 1996. It depicted the Harley-Davidson plant. The first mini- mural was painted in 1998. The last mural was completed in 2002. The murals are unique because they depict some little known people and events in York's history. Each mural tells a little story. The money to pay for the mural project came from donations from businesses and townspeople who were interested in the project. The murals were painted during the day by artists who used scaffolding. The mini-murals were copies from a book by Lewis Miller; these mural images were projected on the wall via an overhead projector at night and sketched, for painting during the day. A coat of Dryvit was applied as a base for each mural. Outdoor house paint was used and then covered with a clear coat. The clear coat protects the mural from weather and graffiti. The life of each mural is about 20 years. Some of them are already disintegrating. Ownership and any maintenance of the murals reverts after 20 years to those who own the buildings on which they are painted, and a mural adoption program began in the mid-2010s to facilitate partnerships with building owners for maintenance. The York County History Center has archived photographs and documentation of the murals.  Lewis Miller Mini Murals  Without Lewis Miller's drawings, there would be far fewer visual clues about what life was like in the 19th century in York. Lewis Miller did some funny drawing such as his portrayal of Mrs. Schreck. She had yellow toenails that were so long that Mr. Schreck had to cut them off with a saw, and she could not wear shoes. Artist Justine Landis and her daughter, Lori Straup turned Lewis Miller's drawings into mini murals. The mini murals are funny but also show serious scenes about the life back in the 19th century. Some mini murals bear Miller's writing in both German and English underneath them. Most Yorkers spoke at least some German in the 18th and early 19th centuries. One mural shows him at work in his carpentry shop. He had hundreds of drawings in his journal and there were so many that a committee selected which murals to feature. Even though the mini murals are larger than life-sized drawings, they are still smaller than the other Murals of York. Some of them are featured in Cherry Lane park, and on the side of the town's Central Market house. There are 16 mini murals in all.  Four Chaplains Mural  The top of the mural shows the Four Chaplains that sacrificed their lives. The four people that are at the top of the mural are George L. Fox,(Methodist); Clark V. Poling,(Dutch Reformed); Alexander D. Goode (Jewish); and John P. Washington, (Roman Catholic). Alexander D. Goode lived in York. Among the Four Chaplains there is a rope connecting each portrait representing their love and peace together. There is also a life raft hanging from the long rope that represents the life rafts that the Four Chaplains gave up for other people. The middle shows the Chaplains linking arms. They are very faint in the mural because they are rising up to heaven together. The bottom of the mural shows the very icy waters that represent the Four Chaplains' graves. One will always remember the history of the Four Chaplains because they sacrificed their lives to save other people when a torpedo hit their ship during World War II. The mural reminds people of this act of bravery.  Community Contributors Mural  The Community Contributors mural is layered like a cake. This mural, The Community Contributors mural has a first layer, a second layer, and even a third layer. The first layer is about the people that help our community such as Samuel Small, John C. Schmidt, Josephine N. McClelland, and A.B. Faquhar. Each one did something really good. For example, Samuel Small helped found the York Collegiate Institute that is now the York College of Pennsylvania. A.B. Farquhar is known as one of York's leading businessmen in the Industrial Revolution and philanthropist. He also made contact with the Confederates early in the Civil War and learned information that would help the Union. Josephine N. McClelland was known for being a local teacher that helped found the YWCA and was a prominent suffragette. John C. Schmidt was a prominent businessman and helped form the first York Bank and was one of the founders of York Manufacturing Association as well as starting a chain company and Schmidt and Ault Paper Company. He also started the York chapter of the American Red Cross during World War I. The second layer is about the community's commitment to help one another. This commitment comes in various fields-arts and education, children and family's, health care, sports, and work. A monument brings together several deceased leaders whose legacy honors the community—George Bowles, Mahlon Haines, Anna Huber, Ben Lavetan, Thomas Hartley and Charles S. Wolf. The third layer is about various services. There are a lot of organizations helping our community. Some of these are fire stations, churches, and libraries. They all helped in special way.

Dr. George Holtzapple Mural  Dr. George Holtzapple, a creative and intelligent physician is the focus of this York mural. The artist, Wayne Fettro, painted this mural to represent Dr. Holtzapple's achievements. On the right, the mural shows Holtzapple. He was smart enough to make a way to give air for a 16-year-old boy who could not breathe. Also, on the right side of the mural is the invention that Dr. Holtzapple used to give the boy air. This mural shows when Dr. Holtzapple got a call that a sixteen- year-old boy could not breathe. The boy really needed Dr. Holtzapple's help. Dr. Holtzapple has been a doctor for less than a year. It was 1885 when Dr. Holtzapple got call from the sixteen-year-old boy's family. They said the boy could not breathe and had pneumonia. When Dr. Holtzapple arrived the boy told him \\"Give me air!\\" Dr. Holtzapple tried an experiment to produce oxygen. His experiment worked and Dr. Holtzapple gained credit for this treatment of pneumonia! The left side of the mural includes an image of the doctor and some information about him.

The Children's Home Mural  The Children's Home Mural is historical and magnificent. It represents more than 100 years of caring for children all over central Pennsylvania. At first it was an orphanage founded by Samuel Small to aid white children in the aftermath of the Civil War. The reason they took the children in is because the Civil War took the lives of many fathers and disrupted the family structure. Mary Sitler Cooper was the person who looked after the children. As the decades passed the Children's Home became more than an orphanage for white children. Eventually the home opened its doors to all types of children who were in need. Counselors, volunteer mentors and foster parents cared for children of all ages and races. The types of needs and services offered also have grown big time. They have increased because they started connecting kids to the community. They did this by letting the kids attend things like public schools, Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, and the YMCA. In fact, the Children's Home services were used so much that its leaders constructed a new home in Springettsbury Township. The original Children's Home, demolished in 1973, was on the southeast corner of Philadelphia and Pine streets. The left part of the Children's Home mural shows Civil War orphans. Moving to the right the mural shows creator Samuel Small. Farther over is a teacher, a girl, a boy and one another boy on a rocking horse. Behind them are three children running to the right of the mural. On the far right is the current building, built in 1990. There is a man and a child, the man is pointing to the right like he is pointing to the future. The home is known as a place that truly cares for those who are in need and is working to making life better for these children. Don and Jared Gray are the artists of the Children's Home of York mural. This wonderful mural is 80 feet wide and 18 feet high!

It is the tomb of Akhethotep, a royal official, located near the western part of the Step Pyramid in Saqqara. Akhethetep was an official with several, mainly religious titles. including priest of Heka, priest of Khnum and priest of Horus.Ziegler, Adam, Andreu-Lanoë 2007, pp. 24-25 The tomb was discovered in 1903 by Georges Aaron Bénédite and two female colleagues, Miss Petrie and Miss Murray. Akhethotep was a high dignitary of Ancient Egypt who lived during the Fifth Dynasty around 2400 BC and directed its construction initially.Bénédite excavated the tomb and reassembled it in the Louvre in Paris. One of the depictions on the wall of the tomb was Akhethotep directing the building of the tomb. History In 1903, the funerary chapel of the tomb was relocated in the Louvre under the direction of Georges Benedite, the Curator of the Egyptian Department of the Museum, after it was bought from the Government of Egypt. The reassembled chapel in the Louvre is a structure of limestone blocks with bas relief that also recreates the monument as it existed originally.) Description Archaeologists, notably Christiane Ziegler, Jean-Pierre Adam and Guillemette Andreu-Lanoë, have identified over eight years (1991-1999) that the tomb was long, in width, respectively about 60 and 30 Egyptian cubits, high present; the initial height can be estimated at approximately .Ziegler, Adam, Andreu-Lanoë 2007, p. 30 The mastaba is accessed through a narrow gate topped by a scroll on which is inscribed the name of the owner. The doorway is decorated in relief with a noteworthy scene of Akhethotep transporting statues to the tomb. The interior forms a small rectangular room whose left wall is pierced by a day that was formerly the tomb which contained the statues of the deceased. Akhethotep's body was buried in a subterranean vault at the end of a shaft. Excavations of the limestone chapel above it have found items which were used in offerings to Akhethotep, from offering tables and statues and the remains of the sacrament funeral in the crypt among which include a canopic jar with a limestone cover plate. It is highly decorated with bas reliefs, illustrating much about the life of Akhethetep on his country estate and feasts with live entertainment. The visitors would come to offer food and drink to his spirit, and recite texts to him, which would provide him with a flourishing afterlife. Among the noteworthy statues found in the vicinity of the chapel of the mastaba, is that of a man standing, probably Akhethotep, wearing a priestly garb wearing a panther skin and the insignia of the goddess Bat. It was also determined that the mastaba was plundered in antiquity and many subsequent burials took place until the Late Period. A subterranean vault at the end of a shaft contained Akhethotep's body. However, the chapel above the tomb was accessible. The west wall with a carved false door, was considered a symbolic representation of a gateway between the land of the living and the dead. The back wall is occupied by two high false door stelae mimicking the facade of the royal palace. The set was painted in bright colors that imitate wood and fabrics adorning the double door. Other walls show classic domestic scenes of life in 2400 BC, such as farm work, hunting in the marshes (including hippopotamus and fish, or the funeral of Akhethotep, meals and festivities and metaphorical images of boating down a river which allude both to his journeys in real life, and to his voyage on the waters of the dead which were to accompany him forever, on the serdab wall. During the refurbishments of the halls of the Louvre in 1985, it was analysed further and restored. The analysis helped to highlight the technical characteristics that distinguish the wall of the false door from the other three walls. The wall of the false door is mainly composed of large slabs of stone, regular shape and symmetrical, surmounted by a series of smaller blocks. The other walls are conceptually different, the blocks are irregular, the most massive stones are placed on the ground, as bedrock. References Bibliography Bertha Poter, Rosalind L.B.

Corporations Auxiliary Company reported that it was able to furnish \\"workmen of all classes for various corporations\\" who would \\"work and live and act with the working men of their establishments, and to keep employers in complete touch with all movements among the men, to give advance information of labor disturbances, and to make possible the discharge of aggressive agitators before their objects have been accomplished.\\" The letter declared that Corporations Auxiliary Company had paid representatives in labor unions, \\"high up in their confidence,\\" reporting to employers, and in some cases controlling the unions.The New York Times, August 16, 1903 The company offered to furnish \\"union or non-union men, American Federation of Labor men, or any other class of men desired.

The healing power of the mineral waters was known to Native Americans living near the Enoree River, and several early European visitors commented on them, including the architect Robert Mills, who in 1826 described the perfectly clear water as smelling strongly “like the washings of a gun barrel” and claimed it to be useful in “curing ring worms and other cutaneous disorders.” Robert Mills, Statistics of South Carolina (Charleston: Hurlburt & Lloyd, 1826), 48. Mills further noted that the “beautiful spring bursts and boils up from the earth in a large stream” and that the waters were “of so salubrious a nature that many persons visit them in the autumn for health.” In 1840, planter Burwell ChickChick was born on January 15, 1776 in Virginia and died January 25, 1847 at Chick Springs. opened a resort at the location, building a “large and commodious hotel.”Greenville Mountaineer, May 27, 1842, quoted in Jean Martin Flynn, A Short History of Chick Springs (Travelers Rest, SC: Loftis Printing Company, 1972), 2. He also allowed some individual \\"cottages\\" to be built on the property. After Chick's death in 1847, the enterprise continued under two of his sons, Pettus and Reuben. By the 1850s, when the railroad had reached the Upstate, the resort attracted hundreds of visitors at a time and boosted the local economy, farmers “for ten and twenty miles around” finding a market for their livestock and produce.Southern Patriot (Greenville), August 10, 1854, quoted in Mann Batson, The Upper Part of Greenville County (Taylors, SC: Faith Printing, 1993), 572-73. A post office was established at Chick Springs in 1851 and discontinued in 1918.

A reporter in 1854 noted “the whole house busy” with “five or six tables of whist parties below the piazzas, two or three card tables employed in the drawing room, two pianos accompanied by sweet voices, one billiard table, at which the balls were constantly cracking, a nine-pin alley, and a great many outsiders and lookers on busily engaged in smoking their cigars. Some were walking to the spring, and at the spring house some were pitching quoits for exercise after drinking the sulphur and chalybeate water.” The reporter further noted the dissection of a fresh watermelon and evening dances that often lasted until midnight.Southern Patriot (Greenville), August 10, 1854, quoted in Mann Batson, The Upper Part of Greenville County (Taylors, SC: Faith Printing, 1993), 572-73. On Sundays the proprietors made the parlor available for Protestant and Catholic services. O’Connell, 368. O’Connell found the proprietors “courteous and liberal-minded men and well fitted for their occupation.” The Chick brothers sold the property in 1857. On the afternoon of November 4, 1862, the hotel caught fire and burned to the ground. In 1868 the Chicks repurchased the property, then in 1885 sold it to George Westmoreland, an Atlanta lawyer, who put up a new hotel and several cottages.Flynn, 2.

In 1914, Bull completed an even larger $100,000 hotel “of Spanish architecture, three stories in height, fireproof, and with all the modern equipment and facilities.”Snowden, 4: 72-73. Flynn says that Chick Springs was sold to J. Thomas Arnold and Associates in 1913. Flynn, 4. Bull's $100,000 of 1914 was probably worth several million at the beginning of the 21st century. MeasuringWorth.com. Bull's venture was unsuccessful, and the property briefly served from 1916 to 1917 as a military academy. Bull then promoted a combination hotel and sanitarium under the direction of a graduate of the University of Georgia, Dr. Benjamin Broadus Steedly, an enterprise that closed shortly after Steedly's death in 1932.Flynn, 5-6. Steedly’s clinic had four physicians on staff and included a school of nursing. Bottling mineral water from the springs remained profitable, and in 1927, the Chick Springs Ginger Ale Company was incorporated to manufacture carbonated beverages. The Company also constructed a swimming pool and opened a park that included picnic facilities and a large dance floor. The business failed during the Depression, and the acres around the mineral spring reverted to the Bull family.Flynn, 7-9. In the late 19th century a process had been devised to extract carbonic- acid gas from mineral springs and use it to carbonate manufactured beverages.

Archaeologists have uncovered large quantities of coins dating to the Anglo-Saxon period, either from hoards or stray finds, making them one of the most plentiful kinds of artefact that survive from this period. Numismatist M.A.S. Blackburn noted that they provide \\"a valuable source of evidence for economic, administrative and political history.\\"Blackburn 1999. p. 113. In recent years, the growth of the metal detecting hobby has allowed many more individual coins not in hoards to be discovered, helping to guide current research. History =5th to 7th centuries= Early in the 5th century CE, when Britannia, broadly comprising what is now England and Wales, ceased to be a province of the Roman Empire, the production of coinage effectively came to an end and a non-monetary economy developed. During the 5th century, Anglo- Saxon tribal groups from continental Europe migrated to central and southern Britain, introducing their own language, polytheistic religion and culture. Although gold coins from continental Europe were traded into Anglo-Saxon England at Kent, they were initially used for decorative purposes, only beginning to be used as money in the early part of the 7th century.Blackburn 1999. p. 113. The first Anglo-Saxon coins were produced by Eadbald of Kent around AD 625, although sustained production would not appear for several more years. These were small, gold coins, called scillingas (shillings) in surviving Anglo-Saxon law codes, although they have since been referred to as thrymsas by numismatists. Modelled on coins produced at the same time in Merovingian Franciageographically the rough equivalent of modern Francethese early Anglo-Saxon gold shillings were often inscribed with words borrowed from either Merovingian or Roman coinage, although examples have been found which instead bear such names as those of King Eadbald of Kent, the moneyers Witmen and Pada, or the names of mints in London and Canterbury.Blackburn 1999. p. 113. However, as the 7th century progressed, the gold coins produced grew increasingly pale until they were replaced by small, thick, silver coins known as sceattas around the year 675. These sceattas were also produced in England, as well as in Germanic continental areas of the North Sea coast, from about 680 to 750, bearing designs which featured a wide range of iconography. In about 675 the gold shilling was superseded by the silver penning, or penny, amongst the Anglo-Saxons, and this would remain the principal English monetary denomination until the mid-14th century, during the Late Medieval period. Early silver pennies were typically decorated with geometric or pictoral designs, occasionally having the name of the moneyer inscribed on them. More rarely, coins produced in the kingdoms of Northumbria and East Anglia bore the names of monarchs.Blackburn 1999. p. 113. =8th to 11th centuries= The silver penny remained in use into the 8th century, but suffered continual debasement as its fineness was decreased with each new generation of striking. This trend continued until Eadberht of Northumbria instituted control over the production of his silver coinage around AD 740, control that was followed by the other early English kings in the years after.Coin of Offa, king of Mercia, 757-796. In the latter part of the 8th century a new style of silver penny appeared in Anglo-Saxon England, thinner and commonly bearing the names of both the king and the moneyer who had struck it. This new type of penny was apparently first introduced in the reign of the Mercian King Offa in about 760.Blackburn 1999. p. 113. From the 9th century, monarchs and their governments gained greater power over the control of coin production, and the designs used by different moneyers became standardised. In the 860s, the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms of Mercia and Wessex formed a monetary alliance by which coinage of a common design could circulate through both of their lands.Blackburn 1999. p. 113. During these centuries there were rare issues of gold coinage. King Offa of Mercia minted a gold coin based on the arab dinar, probably as part of a yearly donation to the Papacy. The later kings Edward the Elder, Ethelred II and Edward the Confessor minted gold coins, as did Archbishop Wigmund of York.Stewart, I.

Originally, the comment was a \\"common sneer aimed at people\\" who had \\"thrown off the faith of their forefathers and adopted the garb of their Fatherland\\". The German assimilation, following the Enlightenment, was \\"unprecedented\\". The quote is sometimes ascribed to Chaim Weizmann. Background Following the Enlightenment, many European Jews regarded Germany as a particularly desirable place to live, \\"a place of refuge, in comparison to Russia and Romania\\" where antisemitism was extremely virulent and violent, and even France, where the Enlightenment had begun. German Jews began to immerse themselves in German culture and the arts, playing a full and even leading role in society. By the twentieth century, the German Jews had reached a state of Bildung und Besitz (i.e. cultivation and wealth).  Forming a German-Jewish identity  Jewish women played a major role in the process of forming German-Jewish identity. Since they understood that Jews can hold both Jewish and national identities, Jewish women raised loyal families to Germany in the Imperial era. They served as mediators of Bildung within their homes and families, while simultaneously serving as agents of tradition.Kaplan, Marion A. (1992). \\"Gender and Jewish History in Imperial Germany\\". Assimilation and Community: The Jews in Nineteenth-Century Europe: 209. Many Jewish women continued to keep koshers homes, attend synagogue on the Sabbath, and perform other Jewish rituals. In this light, Jews could be men and women on the streets and Jews in their homes, as suggested by Enlightenment advocator Yehuda Leib Gordon.Kaplan, Marion A. (1992). \\"Gender and Jewish History in Imperial Germany\\". Assimilation and Community: The Jews in Nineteenth-Century Europe: 201. Furthermore, Jewish women were instrumental in forming the social positions of Jews and their sense of \\"Germanness.\\"Kaplan, Marion A. (1992). \\"Gender and Jewish History in Imperial Germany\\". Assimilation and Community: The Jews in Nineteenth-Century Europe: 219. They encouraged their children to acculturate through their dress, speech and education and appreciated German entertainment and literature. Jewish women sent their children to music lessons and advanced secular schools. Thus, by combining German bourgeois practice and Jewish heritage, they formed a German-Jewish identity that balanced integration and tradition. Jewish women helped their families look, act, and feel like other Germans while remaining Jewish.Kaplan, Marion A. (1992). \\"Gender and Jewish History in Imperial Germany\\". Assimilation and Community: The Jews in Nineteenth-Century Europe: 208. Their actions allowed Jews to ultimately receive the description of being \\"more German than the Germans.\\" Examples (born 1885, died 1944 in Theresienstadt concentration camp), was a conductor, musician, musicologist, and neurologist. He was described by his daughter as \\"more German than the Germans\\", as he earned an Iron Cross for his gallantry in World War I, was music editor for a Berlin newspaper, and published research on German folk songs, Richard Wagner and Anton Bruckner. British scholar Nikolaus Pevsner was described as \\"more German than the Germans\\" for his support of Goebbels' drive for \\"pure non-decadent German art\\" and was reported as saying, of the Nazis in 1933, \\"I want this movement to succeed. There is no alternative but chaos ... there are things worse than Hitlerism\\". German Jew Betty Lipton described German-Jewish identity after emancipation in \\"At Home in Berlin.\\" She wrote that her family kept a kosher home, attended synagogue, and was a part of Berlin's tight-knit Jewish community. Simultaneously, her family was loyal to Germany. In 1914, they displayed the largest black, white, and red flag on their whole street.Kaplan, Marion A.

Bettendorf (July 1, 1857 – June 3, 1910) was a German-American inventor. He is credited with the invention of the power lift sulky plow, the Bettendorf metal wheel and the one-piece railroad truck frame. By the age of 53 he held 94 patents. With his younger brother, Joseph W. Bettendorf, he founded the Bettendorf Axle Company. His first wife and children preceded him in death. He died as the company was rapidly expanding and before he moved into a palatial home he was building. The city of Bettendorf, Iowa is named after the two brothers. Biography =Early life and education= Born in Mendota, Illinois, William Bettendorf was the oldest of four children born to Michael and Catherine (Reck) Bettendorf. His father was born Michael Betteldorf in Nohn in the German Eifel region. He changed his surname to Bettendorf when he immigrated to the United States at age eighteen and became a school teacher. The family moved to Sedalia, Missouri where the elder Bettendorf opened a grocery store, and then to Fort Leavenworth in Kansas where he became a government clerk. William Bettendorf was educated in the public schools and St. Mary's Mission School in Kansas, which primarily educated Native American children. =Early career= He started working as a messenger boy in Humboldt, Kansas in 1870. Two years later he moved to Peru, Illinois where he became a clerk in the hardware store owned by A. L. Shepard. In 1874 he started work as a machinist's apprentice at the Peru Plow Company. It was during this time that he invented the first power lift sulky plow in 1878. The device allowed the farmer to remain seated on his horse-drawn plow and press a lever to raise the plow from the earth. Prior to his invention the farmer had to manually lift the plow blade at the end of each furrow. Most farm implement manufacturers adopted the plow. Bettendorf went on to work at the Moline Plow Company in Moline, Illinois for ten months before becoming the foreman in the fitting department of the Parlin & Orendorff Company in Canton, Illinois, which manufactured plows and other agricultural implements. In 1882 he left Canton and returned to Peru as a supervisor at the Peru Plow Company, where he had been an apprentice. It was here that he invented the Bettendorf metal wheel. =Later career= Bettendorf Company headquarters Bettendorf established a shop to manufacture the wheel at Peru Plow and as the metal wheel branch of the business increased the name of the company was changed to Peru Plow & Wheel Company. Because the company was slow to increase capacity he moved his business to the Eagle Manufacturing Company of Davenport, Iowa after meeting with its president E. P. Lynch. With his brother, J.W. Bettendorf, he manufactured metal wheels at Eagle Manufacturing until 1889 when the brothers started the Bettendorf Metal Wheel Company in Davenport. In 1892 he developed a steel gear for farm wagons and the company manufactured those as well. He severed his ties with Bettendorf Metal Wheel and designed the machinery to manufacture the steel gears, which he eventually sold to International Harvester in 1905. He organized the Bettendorf Axle Company with his brother J.W. The company was incorporated on January 1, 1895. W. P. Bettendorf was the company's first president and J. W. Bettendorf was the secretary. Two fires in 1902, one on January 28 and the other in May, destroyed the plant. The residents of the town of Gilbert, which was about east of Davenport at the time, raised $15,000 to buy the old Gilbert farm between the Mississippi River and the Davenport, Rock Island and North Western Railway tracks. The brothers decided to establish a new plant in Gilbert. A year later the citizens of the town elected to change its name to Bettendorf. The factory was built on a plot of land. The company originally was a manufacturer of agricultural implements. Its rapid growth was spurred by Bettendorf's design of a one-piece railroad truck frame that eliminated bolts. Bolts could loosen as the train moved and cause delays or derailments. The new frame was cast as a single piece of steel and revolutionized the railroad industry. By 1909 the building had grown to three times its original size. It contained two regenerative open-hearth basic steel furnaces, with the capacity to heat . They were able to produce about one hundred tons of finished steel castings daily. These were used to construct railroad boxcars. A complete railroad car was built from raw materials in the east end of the plant to the finished product on the west end. The company expanded in the early 20th century to manufacture oil burners, toys, water pumps, ice crushers and other products. The company also built the Meteor automobile. Between 1903 and 1910 the workforce grew from 300 to 800 employees. =Personal life= Grave in Oakdale Cemetery William Bettendorf married Mary Wortman in 1879. Together they raised two children, Etta and Henry. She died in August 1901. In 1908 he married Elizabeth Staby, who was a widow. He began building a estate on a bluff overlooking Bettendorf and the river valley below. It was located in a grove of oak and maple trees. The house was built in the Spanish Revival style. The exterior featured large porches, a grand fountain and a carriage house that could hold six cars. The interior featured linen tapestries, oak stairways and hand carved oak woodwork, ceiling murals, and a fireplace in every room. Artisans were brought from Europe to complete the detail work. Entire trees were brought on site to be sawn for the paneling, so a room would have matched paneling. The estate was built for more than $150,000. The family lived in a bungalow adjacent to their new residence during the construction. William Bettendorf had emergency surgery a week before they were scheduled to move into the house. He died on June 3, 1910 and was buried in Oakdale Cemetery in Davenport. His wife and stepson lived on the estate until 1926 when they sold it to the Grand Lodge of Iowa AF & AM. They added a 50-room wing which became the Iowa Masonic Nursing Home.

It is used in avian predator control programs, and in scientific research. It is essentially a cage with two (or more) compartments. A previously caught magpie or crow is kept in the decoy compartment, and this attracts territory holders who see the decoy as an intruder. Use in the United Kingdom The Larsen trap is legal to use in the United Kingdom under general licence. It is the most widely used magpie population control method amongst gamekeepers and conservationists. It is also used to trap magpies by back-yard conservationists concerned for the well being of nesting song-birds. The decoy bird must be properly cared for according to local regulations. In 2003 the RSPCA successfully appealed an acquittal of a case in which a single decoy magpie was used throughout the summer in a cage which was too small for the bird to stretch its wings, contrary to the Wildlife and Countryside Act. The law in Scotland permits their use without any training in how to handle and kill birds humanely. Legally set traps are often vandalised.

The methods used are also much debated. Problems arise in particular from the very nature of the target population that is hidden and mostly wants to remain as such. The different definitions of ‘illegality’ adopted in the studies also pose a significant challenge to the comparability of the data. More recently, a study carried out by a research team at LSE for the Greater London Authority, published in 2009, estimated the illegal migrant population of the UK by updating the Home Office study. The LSE's study takes into account other factors not included in the previous estimate, namely the continued arrival of asylum seekers, the clearance of the asylum applications backlog, further illegal migrants entering and leaving the country, more migrants overstaying, and the regularisation of EU accession citizens. The most significant change in this estimate is however the inclusion of children born in the UK to illegal immigrants. For the LSE team illegal migrants oscillate between 417,000 and 863,000, including a population of UK-born children ranging between 44,000 and 144,000. Drawing on this and taking stock of the outcome of the recent Case Resolution Programme, a University of Oxford's study by Nando Sigona and Vanessa Hughes estimate at end 2011 a population of illegal migrant children of 120,000, with over half born in the UK to parents residing without legal immigration status.  Definitions  According to the House of Commons Library, several definitions for a migrant exist in United Kingdom so that a migrant can be: * Someone whose country of birth is different to their country of residence. * Someone whose nationality is different to their country of residence. * Someone who changes their country of usual residence for a period of at least a year, so that the country of destination effectively becomes the country of usual residence. http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/SN06077 Illegal immigrants in the UK include those who have: * entered the UK without authority * entered with false documents * overstayed their visas * worked or studied on a tourist visa/ non-immigrant visa waiver * entered into forced or fraudulent marriage * had their marriages terminated or annulled  Action of the French forces  France has a plan launched in January 2019 to stop migrant to cross the Channel. This plan is deployed both inland and over the sea.This plan is rather ineffective, with the failure of 55% of the attempts to cross the Channel.

Political reaction  Migration Watch UK, is a think-tank that claims to be neutral. Migration Watch UK has criticised the Home Office figures for not including the UK-born dependent children of unauthorised migrants. They suggest the Home Office has underestimated the numbers of unauthorised migrants by between 15,000 and 85,000.The illegal Migrant Population in the UK Migration Watch UK, Briefing paper 9.15,Migration Trends. Jack Dromey, Deputy General of the Transport and General Workers Union and Labour Party treasurer, suggested in May 2006 that there could be around 500,000 illegal workers. He called for a public debate on whether an amnesty should be considered.Amnesty call over illegal workers BBC News, 20 May 2006. Former Home Secretary David Blunkett suggested that this might be done once the identity card scheme is rolled out.Blunkett: Immigration amnesty on cards epolitix.com, 14 June 2006 However the scheme was scrapped due to its widespread unpopularity by the coalition government in 2010. London Citizens, a coalition of community organisations, is running a regularisation campaign called Strangers into Citizens, backed by figures including the leader of the Catholic Church in England and Wales, the Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O'Connor.Joe Boyle, Migrants find a voice in the rain, BBC News, 7 May 2007, accessed 21 May 2007 Analysis by the Institute for Public Policy Research suggested that an amnesty would net the government up to £1.038 billion per year in fiscal revenue. However, analysis by MigrationWatch UK suggests that if the migrants granted amnesty were given access to healthcare and other benefits, the net cost to the exchequer would be £5.530 billion annually. It has since been suggested that to deport all of the irregular migrants from the UK would take 20 years and cost up to £12 billion. former Mayor of London Boris Johnson commissioned a study into a possible amnesty for illegal immigrants, citing larger tax gains within the London area which is considered to be home to the majority of the country's population of such immigrants. In February 2008, the government introduced new £10,000 fines for employers found to be employing illegal immigrants where there is negligence on the part of the employer, with unlimited fines or jail sentences for employers acting knowingly. In July 2013, the Home Office introduced an advertising lorry in London with its billboard saying \\"In the UK illegally? — GO HOME OR FACE ARREST — Text HOME to 78070 for free advice, and help with travel documents. We can help you return home voluntarily without fear of arrest or detention.\\" This campaign was criticised from various quarters: Vince Cable, a prominent minister in the governing coalition, called it \\"stupid and offensive\\"; some on the left said that \\"go home\\" evoked an old National Front slogan. Nigel Farage of the UK Independence Party criticised the campaign as \\"nasty\\" and suggested that its real message was \\"Please don’t vote UKIP, we’re doing something\\". In 2015 the newly elected Conservative Government announced it would be requiring Landlords to confirm the immigration status of tenants. Those failing to do so, or knowingly or unknowingly housing illegal immigrants could face criminal prosecution. This policy is called \\"Right to Rent\\", part of the Hostile Environment. In 2015 a large number of migrants had set up a camp at Calais in the hope of entering the UK illegally, although there have always been some migrants entering the UK illegally from here many illegal migrants or asylum seekers try to enter the UK from France, by hiding inside trucks or trains and they've done so for years. This sparked a large political debate in the UK. The UK government responded by funding additional security measures in Calais including a £7 million fence to prevent migrants entering the UK.

His religious policies, formed from these experiences, comprised increasing toleration of Christianity, limited regulations against Roman polytheism with toleration, participation in resolving religious disputes such as schism with the Donatists, and the calling of councils including the Council of Nicaea concerning Arianism.Peter Brown, The Rise of Christendom 2nd edition (Oxford, Blackwell Publishing, 2003) John Kaye characterizes the conversion of Constantine, and the council of Nicea that Constantine called, as two of the most important things to ever happen to the Christian church.KAYE, John. Some account of the Council of Nicæa in connexion with the life of Athanasius. United Kingdom, n.p, 1853. Historical background =Politics and persecution in Constantine's early years= Politics The Crisis of the Third Century (AD 235–284), was a period of heavy barbarian invasions and migrations into Roman territory. According to Peter Brown, imperial Rome's system of government was an easy–going system which governed indirectly through the regional, local elites, and was not built to survive the strain of continuous invasions and civil wars. During this period of crisis, life in a \\"beleaguered superpower\\" included bankruptcies, political fragmentation and military losses. Constantine was born during this period in AD 273 and was raised a polytheist by his polytheist parents.Jonathan Bardill, Research Fellow in Byzantine Archaeology; Bardill, Jonathan. \\"Constantine, Divine Emperor of the Christian Golden Age\\". United Kingdom, Cambridge University Press, 2012. Roman Emperor Diocletian - panoramio The third century crisis had begun with the assassination of Emperor Severus Alexander by his own troops in 235 which led to a 50-year long leadership crisis with at least 26 claimants to the title of emperor. By 268, the empire had split into three competing states. The crisis didn't end until Diocletian took the reins and implemented reforms in 284. He restructured the Roman government by establishing the Tetrarchy, a system with four men ruling jointly over an empire divided into two parts, East and West. Each part was headed by an Augustus who had a subordinate Caesar. Diocletian ruled as head Augustus in the East, from AD 284–305, with Maximian as Augustus in the West, AD 286–305. Diocletian established administrative capitals located closer to the empire's borders for each of the four Tetrarchs. These changes helped restore imperial power by the end of the third century. While the Tetrarchy itself didn't last long, Jonathan Bardill says that it made some permanent changes to the empire. The empire could no longer be seen as \\"a commonwealth of cities.\\" Government became more centralized around the imperial court as the only certain source of power and influence; elites lost some of their wealth and status. The process of centralization took place in each region where a capital city emerged, while other cities shrank. The cities were no longer unique and different. Instead, what all cities had in common was ideology: a shared loyalty to the emperor and his followers. Brown says that the empire became more intrusive into the personal lives of its subjects as it also became more committed to an ideological stance. Persecution This led to a suppression of Christianity that was more severe than any seen before and which took place on an empire-wide scale. On 24 February, AD 303, Diocletian issued the first of a series of edicts that rescinded Christians' legal rights and demanded compliance with traditional polytheistic religious practices. Christianity had existed for over 250 years; both the Church and the empire had changed in that time. The Church was no longer composed of tiny scattered groups. According to Peter Brown, it had become a 'universal church' that functioned as a \\"city within a city.\\" There was a \\"Christian gentry\\" established in Asia Minor, and a developed hierarchy within the church, of leaders who were prominent in the Roman world of their day. Persecution began with this leadership, forcing Christian bishops to participate in sacrifice to the traditional Roman gods or die. According to Norman H. Baynes, in the second year of the persecution, after the arrival of Urbanus as governor of Palestine, the imperial edict extending the order for sacrifice to the general public was then also published. Known to Christians as the Great Persecution, Baynes says it had two phases. The first phase began with the issue of the First Edict in 303; the second phase began with the issue of the Fourth Edict, whose date and authorship are debated. David M. Potter says these edicts were enforced more in the East than in the West. In addition to martyrdom, the First Edict also saw churches destroyed and demanded that the written scriptures and other Christian books be surrendered. At a time when the Emperor's law was seen as the divine source of order and peace, the Church claimed to possess its own universal divine law in the Christian scriptures, so the soldiers were sent out to confiscate and burn them. This is what scholars such as Maureen A. Tilley see as the cause of the Donatist schism. Donatists believed that every book of scripture was not just pen and ink, but was the physical manifestation of the Word of God, and that handing over the scriptures to be burnt, and handing over a martyr to die, were two sides of the same coin. Those who cooperated with the soldiers were, in the Latin, traditores: traitors. Thereafter, Donatists refused to allow traditores back into church leadership positions. The Donatists would later become a thorn in Constantine's side which lasted throughout his reign. In 305, Diocletian decided to resign and he compelled Maximian to retire as well.Little, Charles Eugene. Cyclopedia of Classified Dates, with an Exhaustive Index ...: For the Use of Students of History .... United Kingdom, Funk & Wagnalls Company, 1899. Galerius was Diocletian's son-in-law; both he and Constantius I, who was Constantine's father, had previously both been adopted by Diocletian. They were accordingly appointed Augustii of the East and West, respectively, on 1 May AD 305.Hoeber, Karl. \\"Valerius Maximianus Galerius.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 6. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 22 Jul. 2020 . Very soon after Diocletian stepped down, his successors began to struggle for control of the Roman Empire. =Family that divides together= Constantine and his father left Gaul and crossed into Britain to win a great battle over the Picts, but on 25 July 306, Constantine's father Constantius died in Eboracum (York). Afterwards, Constantine's father's troops proclaimed Constantine as Augustus in the West, and he agreed. However, Galerius didn't. Even though Constantine was the son of the Western Augustus Constantius, Diocletian had made a \\"rule\\" in 305 that sons should not follow their fathers in power. David Potter says stories circulating at the time said this was all part of the machinations of Galerius to prevent Constantine from becoming the senior emperor. The West at this time was still largely undeveloped. The military's support of Constantine forced Galerius as Augustus of the more developed and wealthier East, to recognize Constantine's claim, but only partially. Galerius appointed his own supporter Severus to the position of Augustus of the West, and proclaimed Constantine as Severus' subordinate Caesar. Then, on 28 October 306, Maxentius, son of Maximian, declared himself Augustus of the West, holding Italy and living in Rome from AD 306–312.Constantine and the Christian Empire. London: Routledge, 2004. Maxentius summoned his father, Maximian, out of retirement for support. Maxentius was then declared a usurper, and Galerius ordered his co-Augustus, Severus, to dislodge Maxentius from Italy in early 307. Once Severus arrived in Italy, however, his army defected to Maxentius.Timothy D. Barnes, Constantine and Eusebius (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 1981) Severus was captured and taken to the camp Tres Tabernae outside of Rome, where he either committed suicide, or was executed, in 307. Galerius himself marched on Maxentius in Rome in the autumn of that year, but also failed to take the city. Constantine watched from Gaul and avoided conflict with both Maxentius and the Eastern emperors for most of this period. Constantine's holdings at this time were not much: mostly Britain, Gaul and Spain. Leithart says that, Constantine realized Galerius was an insecure foundation to build his future on, so Constantine made alliance with Maximian and Maxentius, sealing that alliance by marrying Maximian's daughter Fausta in the summer of AD 307. In the spring of 308, Maximian attempted to depose his son, Maxentius, asking his former army to choose between father and son. They chose the son, and Maximian fled to his son-in-law Constantine.Coinage and History of the Roman Empire. United Kingdom, Taylor & Francis, 2016.Chapter 10 Galerius nephew and Caesar was Maximinus II, also known as, Maximinus Daia. After Severus' death, Maximinus expected to be raised to Augustus in his place and was bitterly disappointed in 308 AD, when at the Conference of Carnuntum, Licinius was declared Augustus of the West instead. In 310 AD, a bitter and disappointed Maximinus II allowed his troops to proclaim him Augustus. That makes five men with serious claims to the same position of Augustus in the West. The empire was in full out civil war. Two claimants to the position of Augustus died in 310: The first was Alexander of Carthage who had proclaimed himself emperor in AD 308. Maxentius sent his praetorian prefect Rufius Volusianus to deal with Alexander who was subsequently taken prisoner and executed by strangulation. The next to die was Maximian, Constantine's father- in-law. In 310, Constantine deployed his father-in-law on a mission to Arles where Maximian proceeded to announce that Constantine was dead; then he declared himself emperor. Response wasn't what he hoped, and he fled to Marseilles, but Constantine force-marched his army there, and Maximian was caught and allowed, or ordered, to commit suicide. Constantine then broke off his alliance with his brother-in-law Maxentius and joined with Licinius who was to marry Constantine's sister, Constantia. Peter Leithart points out that Constantine spent his life in the military, often fighting other Romans, who also happened to be members of his extended family. By the time Constantine's life ended, \\"he was responsible for the death of his father-in-law Maximian, his brother-in-law Maxentius, his sister's husband Licinius and their son, Constantine's nephew, his wife Fausta and her and Constantine's son Crispus, and a few other relatives.\\" Civil War By 310, Galerius' health was failing and his power eroding. After his death in 311, the Balkan territories were quickly occupied by Licinius, while Maxentius obtained the populous and prosperous Asia Minor for himself to add to his holdings in Italy. In the spring of 312, Constantine determined he needed to deal with Maxentius himself.Cowen, Ross (2016). Milvian Bridge AD 312: Constantine's battle for Empire and Faith. Oxford, UK: Osprey Publishing. . Potter says scholars don't know who approached who, but Licinius and Constantine came to an agreement that appears to have involved mutual military support against Maxentius. While Licinius kept some of Maxentius' troops occupied in northern Italy, Constantine gathered an army of 40,000 soldiers and crossed the Alps heading toward Rome. According to Peter Leithart, Constantine met Maxentius' forces at Susa, Turin and Verona where he was victorious each time. According to T.Barnes, the praetorian prefect Ruricius Pompeianus, Maxentius' most senior general, was killed at Verona.Barnes, Timothy D. Constantine and Eusebius. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1981. \\"By October, Constantine was camped within sight of Rome, on the Tiber, near the Milvian Bridge.\\" Triumph of Constantine over Maxentius at the Battle of the Milvian Bridge (tapestry) - 1623-1625 Averil Cameron says Lactantius records that Constantine had a dream the night before battle where he was told to place the chi-rho (a symbol of Christ) on his soldiers' shields. Eusebius, however, makes no mention of such a vision. Eusebius compares the battle to the triumph of Moses over Pharaoh at the Rea Sea since Maxentius and his soldiers \\"sank as lead into the mighty waters\\" as the Book of Exodus says of Pharaoh. Bardill says the two armies met at the Saxa Rubra as Constantine approached the capitol from his camp. Maxentius' troops were forced back to the Tiber river where Maxentius had destroyed the bridge in hopes of trapping Constantine's troops. They would have been forced to cross the Tiber on the remaining pontoons, but it was Maxentius who was trapped instead. Maxentius drowned when the pontoons came apart. According to Troels Myrup Kristensen, the day after the battle, Maxentius body was found and decapitated, and his head was paraded through the streets of Rome before being taken to Africa. Conversion to Christianity Nine years after Diocletian celebrated twenty years of stable rule with a smoking altar in the Roman Forum and the most severe persecution of Christians in the empire's history, the victorious Constantine I entered Rome and bypassed the altar on the capitol without offering sacrifice. According to Church historians writing after his death, Constantine had by then converted to Christianity, making him the first Christian Roman emperor. In his Oration to the Assembly of the Saints Constantine says he was not a child or a youth when he converted. Bardill says this is likely, as Constantine's parents were both polytheists; his mother was only persuaded to convert after Constantine had already done so. Bardill considers it likely Constantine converted some time between 310 and 315. Brown calls Constantine's conversion a \\"very Roman conversion.\\" \\"He had risen to power in a series of deathly civil wars, destroyed the system of divided empire, believed the Christian God had brought him victory, and therefore regarded that god as the proper recipient of religio. He did all of this without according religio to the traditional gods,\\" and Brown says \\"this is how his subjects came to realize he was a Christian.\\" Brown says Constantine was over 40, had most likely been a traditional polytheist, and was a savvy and ruthless politician when he declared himself a Christian. His first step after conquering was to eclipse the memory of Maxentius, which he did by filling the center of Rome with monuments such as the Triumphal Arch and the Arch of Constantine. These monuments contain no reference to Christianity. However, in 312, Constantine ordered a statue of himself and Bardill quotes Eusebius as saying Constantine determined his statue should have \\"a trophy of the Savior's Passion to be set up beneath the hand of his own statue—indeed, he ordered them to place him in the most frequented spot in Rome, holding the saving sign in his right hand.\\" Some time after 324, he wrote to the king of Persia, Shapur II: \\"Him I call upon with bended knee, shunning all abominable blood and hateful odors [of pagan sacrifice].\\" Noel Lenski observes that the myth of Constantine being baptized by Pope Sylvester developed toward the end of the fifth century in a romantic depiction of Sylvester's life which has survived as the Actus beati Sylvestri papai (CPL 2235). Lenski says this story absolved the medieval church of a major embarrassment: Constantine's baptism by an Arian bishop, Eusebius of Nicomedia, which occurred while on campaign to Persia. According to Hans Pohlsander and Noel Lenski, Constantine swung through the Holy Land with the intent of being baptized in the Jordan river, but he became deathly ill at Nicomedia where he was swiftly baptized. He died shortly thereafter on 22 May 337 at a suburban villa named Achyron.Pohlsander, Hans. The Emperor Constantine. London & New York: Routledge, 2004a. Hardcover Paperback , 75–76; Lenski, Noel, ed. The Cambridge Companion to the Age of Constantine. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2006. Hardcover Paperback , \\"Reign of Constantine\\" (CC), 82. The Catholic Encyclopedia says there are no known contemporary documents that attest to an earlier intention to become a member of the Church. Francis Opoku writes that, \\"Whilst some are of the opinion that Constantine‟s conversion was genuine, others think that his policies to support Christians were for political expediency.\\" As a converted Christian, why did he still have the unconquered sun —Sol Invictus— on his coins? Why was he never a properly instructed catechumen? Why was he not baptized until he was on his death bed? Constantine's initial grasp of Christianity was shallow, but as time went on Opoku says, it does seem as though he came to see himself as God's appointed sovereign, rewarded with divine favor. According to Opoku, \\"It thus appeared that Constantine gained, rather than lost, his willingness to exchange the style and title of a god for that of God's vice-regent.\\" =Constantine's religious beliefs and policies= Peter J. Leithart says Constantine was \\"a sincere if a somewhat simple believer.\\" He ended the persecution of Christians, restored confiscated property to the churches, and adopted a policy toward non-Christians of toleration with limits. \\"He did not punish pagans for being pagans, or Jews for being Jews, and did not adopt a policy of forced conversion.\\" Pagans remained in important positions at his court. He outlawed the gladiatorial shows, destroyed temples and plundered more, and used forceful rhetoric against non-Christians. But he never engaged in a purge. Maxentius' supporters were not slaughtered when Constantine took the capital; Licinius' family and court were not killed. There were no pagan martyrs. Leithart says Constantine attributed his military success to God, and during his reign, the empire was relatively peaceful. Paganism Following the Battle of the Milvian Bridge, Constantine and his co-Augustus Licinius issued the Edict of Milan which granted religious toleration. The Edict protected all faiths from religious persecution, not just the Christian faith. It allowed anyone to worship whichever deity they chose.\\"Edict of Milan\\", 313CE. According to H. A. Drake, much has been written from differing views on Constantine's religious policies, but \\"Constantine's commitment to unity in the church [is] one policy on which virtually all parties agree.\\" Conflicting views only arise when the topic shifts to whether or not this unity included pagans. Drake says that Jacob Burckhardt characterized Constantine as being \\"essentially unreligious\\", using the Church solely to support his power and ambition. However, Drake goes on to say that \\"critical reaction against Burckhardt's anachronistic reading has been decisive.\\" Burckhardt used a method rooted in the Reformation by choosing politics to question Constantine's religious conviction. According to Drake, this doesn't give an accurate view because politics is in everything and religion isn't determined by it. Constantine never directly outlawed paganism. In the words of an early edict, he decreed that polytheists could \\"celebrate the rites of an outmoded illusion,\\" so long as they did not force Christians to join them. In addition, there are accounts that indicate Constantine remained somewhat tolerant of the pagans. His provisions in the earlier Edict of Milan were restated in the Edict of the Provincials. Drake points out that this edict called for peace and tolerance: \\"Let no one disturb another, let each man hold fast to that which his soil wishes…\\" Constantine never reversed this edict. Drake contemplates whether Constantine may have been trying to create a society where the two religions were syncretized. However, Constantine also \\"assails pagan temples as 'temples of falsehood',\\" and denounces paganism as idolatry and superstition in the same document. Constantine and his contemporary Christians did not treat paganism as a living religion; it was defined as a superstitio— an 'outmoded illusion.' According to Burckhardt and his followers, being Christian automatically meant being intolerant; however, as Drake points out, that assumes a uniformity of belief within Christianity that does not exist in the historical record. Brown says that the church was never monolithic. In Drake's view, there are indications that Constantine did not convert to a belief in a church of a few pristine elect, but to a belief in Christianity as a \\"big tent\\" capable of containing different wings. Drake says the evidence indicates Constantine favored those who favored consensus, chose pragmatists over ideologues of any persuasion, and wanted peace and harmony \\"but also inclusiveness and flexibility.\\" In his article Constantine and Consensus, Drake concludes that Constantine's religious policy was aimed at including the Church in a broader policy of civic unity, even though his personal views undoubtedly favored one religion over the other. Some of Constantine's choices have not left historians with a simple reading of his beliefs. Johann Peter Kirsch says the consensus of the sources is that Constantine had both his son and wife executed at his instigation. He also ordered the execution of eunuch priests in Egypt because they transgressed his moral norms.J. Kirsch, \\"God Against the Gods\\", Viking Compass, 2004. According to MacMullen, Constantine made many derogatory and contemptuous comments relating to the old religion; writing of the \\"true obstinacy\\" of the pagans, of their \\"misguided rites and ceremonial\\", and of their \\"temples of lying\\" contrasted with \\"the splendours of the home of truth\\".R. MacMullen, \\"Christianizing The Roman Empire A.D.100-400, Yale University Press, 1984, Although Constantine is regarded as the first Christian emperor, this does not mean that there are no longer any pagans in the empire. Christians most likely formed between sixteen and seventeen percent of empire at the time of Constantine's conversion. They did not have the numerical advantage to form a sufficient power–base to begin a systematic persecution of pagans. However, Brown reminds us \\"We should not underestimate the fierce mood of the Christians of the fourth century:\\" repression, persecution and martyrdom do not generally breed tolerance of those same persecutors. Brown says Roman authorities had shown no hesitation in \\"taking out\\" the Christian church that they saw as a threat to empire, and that Constantine and his successors did the same for the same reasons. Constantine would sporadically prohibit public sacrifice and close pagan temples; very little pressure, however, was put on individual pagans. Just as persecution of Christians had been sporadic, actions against pagans were also sporadic. Lives were lost around the imperial court for various reasons and intrigues, but there is no evidence of judicial killings for illegal sacrifices before Tiberius Constantine (574-582). Drake and Hans-Ulrich Wiemer are two among many who agree that Constantine was generally not in favor of suppression of paganism by force.Wiemer, Hans- Ulrich. \\"Libanius on Constantine\\". The Classical Quarterly, vol. 44, no. 2, 1994, pp. 511–524. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/639654. Accessed 23 June 2020. Instead, Constantine took steps to legally limit the public practice of pagan worship. Constantine's main approach was to use enticement by making the adoption of Christianity beneficial. =Ban on new temples and pillaging the old= Follis issued 309/'10 by Constantine at Lugdunum. The reverse describes Constantine as the \\"companion of Sol Invictus\\". () On Sunday 8 November 324, Constantine consecrated Byzantium as his new residence, Constantinoupolis — \\"city of Constantine\\" — with the local pagan priests, astrologers, and augurs. However, the emperor still went back to Rome to celebrate his Vicennalia: his twenty-year jubilee.Balzer, Mary. \\"Constantine’s Constantinople: A Christian Emperor, A Pagan City.\\" (2013). Two years after the consecration of Constantinople, Constantine left Rome behind, and on Monday 4 November 328, new rituals were performed to dedicate the city as the new capital of the Roman empire. Among the attendants were the Neoplatonist philosopher Sopater and pontifex maximus Praetextus.Vanderspoel, John. \\"Correspondence and correspondents of Julius Julianus.\\" Byzantion 69.2 (1999): 396-478. In commemoration, Constantine had a statue of the goddess of fortune Tyche built, and a column made of porphyry, where he placed a golden statue of Apollo with the face of Constantine looking toward the sun. Litehart says \\"Constantinople was newly founded, but it deliberately evoked the Roman past religiously as well as politically.\\" Although by this time Constantine openly supported Christianity, the city still offered room to pagan cults: there were shrines for the Dioscuri and Tyche. Hans-Ulrich Wiemer says there is good reason to believe the ancestral temples of Helios, Artemis and Aphrodite remained functioning in Constantinople as well. The Acropolis, with its ancient pagan temples, was left as it was. Labarum of Constantine the Great On 11 May 330, the dedication of the city was celebrated with the festival of Saint Mocius and the striking of commemorative medallions and coins.Ramskold, Lars, and Noel Lenski. Constantinople's dedication medallions and the maintenance of civic traditions. Österreichische Numismatische Gesellschaft, 2012. Up until 325, Constantine had \\"continued to pay his public honors to the Sun\\" on coins that showed him jointly with Sol Invictus, whereas these later coins showed the labarum instead.MacMullan 1984:44. Gerberding says that in the new capital city of Constantinople, Constantine made sure there were no new pagan temples built.Gerberding, R. and J. H. Moran Cruz, Medieval Worlds (New York: Houghton Mifflin Company, 2004) Brown adds that traditional blood sacrifice was certainly never performed there. According to French historian Gilbert Dagron, there were fewer temples constructed in the entire empire after the building craze of the 2nd century ended. However, Constantine's reign did not comprise the end of temple construction. He both permitted and commissioned temple construction in areas outside Constantinople.Dagron, Gilbert. \\"Naissance d'une capitale: Constantinople et ses institutions de 330 à 451.\\" Bibliothèque byzantine/Etudes (1974). Trombley says the dedication of new temples is attested in the historical and archaeological records until the end of the 4th century.Trombley, F. R. 1995a. Hellenic Religion and Christianisation, c. 370-529. New York. I. 166-8, II. 335-6 Constantine pillaged many pagan sanctuaries, but according to Hans-Ulrich Wiemer, that pillaging was motivated more by a desire to supply his new capital with \\"imposing statuary\\" than it was by a desire to destroy paganism. Noel Lenski also says Constantinople was \\"literally crammed with statuary gathered, in Jerome's words, by 'the virtual denuding' of every city in the East.\\" According to Ramsay MacMullen, Constantine wanted to obliterate non- Christians, but lacking the means, he had to be content with robbing their temples. However, Wiemer says that Libanius, the contemporary chronicler of Constantine, writes in a passage from his In Defense of the Temples, that Constantine looted the Temples in order to get their treasures to build Constantinople, not because of anti-paganism. Brown says Constantine \\"deliberately drained the Eastern provinces of their pagan art turning his new city into an open air museum.\\" Brown concludes this indicates,\\"A post pagan world was not, by any means, necessarily a Christian world.\\" According to Wiemer, Constantine destroyed some pagan sanctuaries, including the prestigious Asclepias at Cilician Aegeae. Constantine destroyed the Temple of Aphrodite in Lebanon. He 'confiscated' the military colony of Aelia Capitolina (Jerusalem) and destroyed a temple there for the purpose of constructing a church. Christian historians had alleged that Hadrian (2nd century) had constructed a temple of Aphrodite on the site of the crucifixion on Golgotha hill in order to suppress Jewish-Christian veneration there. Constantine used that to justify the temple's destruction, saying he was simply 'reclaiming' the property. Head of Aphrodite, 1st century AD copy of an original by Praxiteles. The Christian cross on the chin and forehead was intended to \\"deconsecrate\\" a Holy pagan artifact. Found in the Agora of Athens. National Archaeological Museum in Athens. Using the same vocabulary of reclamation, Constantine acquired several more sites of Christian significance in the Holy Land for the purpose of constructing churches. Most of these sites had been \\"polluted\\" by pagan shrines and needed \\"desacrilization\\" or deconsecration before they could be used. (The practice of \\"cleansing\\" a sacred site of its previous spiritual influences was not limited to Christians.) According to Bayliss, the historical writings of Prudentius indicate the deconsecration of a temple merely required the removal of the cult statue and altar. However, this was often extended to the removal or even destruction of other statues and icons, votive stelae and all other internal imagery and decoration. Such objects were not always destroyed, some were desacralized or \\"cleansed\\" by having crosses chiseled onto them and perhaps a rite performed over them. Some were simply relocated and displayed as works of art. For example, the Parthenon frieze was preserved after the Christian conversion of the temple, although in modified form.Deichmann, F. W. 1975. Die Spolien in der spätantiken Architektur. Bayerische Akademie der Wissenschaften, Phil.-Hist. Kl. 6. München. At the sacred oak and spring at Mambre, a site venerated and occupied by both Jews and pagans alike, Constantine apparently ordered the burning of the idols, the destruction of the altar, and erection of a church. The archaeology of the site, however, demonstrates that Constantine's church along with its attendant buildings, only occupied a peripheral sector of the precinct, leaving the rest unhindered. Constantine and his successors brought wealth, peace, and the opportunity to build a strong local position, to the churches. Christianity had already shown itself as able to distribute money in support of its religious causes; following the Roman tradition of endowments, Constantine became a donor of over-powering generosity. After 320, Constantine supported the Christian church with his patronage, built basilicas, and endowed the church with land and other wealth.MacMullen, Ramsay. Christianizing the Roman Empire: (A.D. 100–400). United Kingdom, Yale University Press, 1984. He set up St.Peter's in Rome and San Giovanni in Laterano; in Antioch, he built a large golden domed octagon and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem. The construction of the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, and other churches built by Constantine after his mother the empress Helena undertook a trip to Palestine (326–328 AD), were only the beginning. By the end of the Byzantine period (235/325 - 614 AD), Mark A. Meyers writes that approximately 400 churches and chapels, along with over a hundred new synagogues, had been built in Palestine and Jordan. Under Constantine, most of the temples remained open for the official pagan ceremonies and for the more socially acceptable activities of 'libation' and the offering of incense. Church restrictions opposing the pillaging of pagan temples by Christians were in place even while the Christians were being persecuted by the pagans. Spanish bishops in AD 305 decreed that anyone who broke idols and was killed while doing so was not formally to be counted as a martyr, as the provocation was too blatant.Ramsay MacMullen, Christianizing the Roman Empire, 1986, Yale University Press. Despite the polemic of Eusebius, Constantine's principal contribution to the downfall of the temples lay primarily in his neglect of them. =Ban on sacrifices= Scott Bradbury writes that Constantine's policies toward pagans are \\"ambiguous and elusive\\" and that \\"no aspect has been more controversial than the claim he banned blood sacrifices.\\" Sources on this are contradictory: Eusebius says he did; Labanius says it was Constantius II who did so and not Constantine I.Eusebius Pamphilius and Schaff, Philip (Editor) and McGiffert, Rev. Arthur Cushman, PhD (Translator) NPNF2-01. Eusebius Pamphilius: Church History, Life of Constantine, Oration in Praise of Constantine quote: \\"he razed to their foundations those of them which had been the chief objects of superstitious reverence\\" According to R. Malcolm Errington, in Book 2 of Eusebius' De vita Constantini, chapter 44, Eusebius explicitly states that Constantine wrote a new law \\"appointing mainly Christian governors and also a law forbidding any remaining pagan officials from sacrificing in their official capacity.\\" Other significant evidence fails to support Eusebius' claim of an end to sacrifice. Constantine, in his Letter to the Eastern Provincials, never mentions any law against sacrifices. Errington says it is generally seen that the Letter's purpose \\"is to flatter and praise the Christians, to show the personal commitment of the emperor to their cause, while at the same time preventing a crusade against the unbelieving.\\" Archaeologist Luke Lavan writes that blood sacrifice was already declining in popularity, just as construction of new temples was also declining, but that this seems to have little to do with anti-paganism. Drake says Constantine personally abhorred sacrifice and removed the obligation to participate in them from the list of duties for imperial officials, but evidence of an actual sweeping ban on sacrifice is slight, while evidence of its continued practice is great. =Legislation against magic and private divination= Michelle Salzman says that, in the fourth century, there was a conceptual connection between superstito as illicit divination or magic and fear of the divine.Salzman, Michele R. “'Superstitio' in the 'Codex Theodosianus' and the Persecution of Pagans\\". Vigiliae Christianae, vol. 41, no. 2, 1987, pp. 172–188. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/1584108. Accessed 27 July 2020. Laws against the private practice of divination had been enacted in the early imperial period of AD 1-30 before the time of the emperor Tiberius. Luke Lavan explains, private practices were associated with treason and secret plots against the emperor. The fear of a rival, had led many emperors to be severe against those who attempted to divine their successor. Maijastina Kahlos says that Christian emperors inherited this fear of private practices, including the fear of private divination. Emperors had long thought to keep knowledge of the future for themselves, therefore private divination, astrology, and 'Chaldean practices' became associated with magic and carried the threat of banishment and execution long before Constantine. From emperor to emperor, private and secret rituals were constantly at risk of falling into the category of magic. However, Constantine's decree against private divination did not classify divination as magic, therefore, Constantine allowed the haruspices to practice their rituals in public. According to Kahlos, he still labeled it \\"superstitio.\\" Donatism Constantine became the first Emperor in the Christian era to persecute specific groups of Christians in order to enforce religious unity.\\"There is No Crime for Those who Have Christ: Religious Violence in the Christian Roman Empire\\", Michael Gaddis, p55-56, University of California Press, 2005, After the Diocletianic persecution, many of those who had cooperated with the authorities wanted to return to their positions in the church. Maureen Tilley says the different responses to this 'returning' among the North African Christians were already becoming apparent by AD305. According to Tilley, this difference is because many of the North African Christians had a long established tradition of a \\"physicalist approach to religion.\\" The sacred scriptures were not simply books to them, but were the Word of God in physical form; they saw handing over the Bible, and handing over a person to be martyred, as \\"two sides of the same coin.\\" During the Great Persecution, \\"When Roman soldiers came calling, some of the [Catholic] officials handed over the sacred books, vessels, and other church goods rather than risk legal penalties\\" over a few objects. These people became known as traditores; the term originally meant one who hands over a physical object, but it came to mean \\"traitor\\" to these North African Christians. They were the rigorists, who would become known as Donatists, and they continued to resent Roman government and refused to accept traditores back into church leadership positions, citing the need for ecclesiastical purity. This rejection extended to the traditores' descendants as well. Catholics were more tolerant and wanted to wipe the slate clean and accommodate the new government. There were also different views of baptism and some other practices, but Alan Cameron says Donatism was not an actual heresy with differences in important doctrine, instead, it was a schism over differences in practices. In 311, the bishop of Carthage, Mensurius, died. The twelve bishops of the region were supposed to gather and elect a successor, but instead, the Donatists and the Catholics, each elected one of their own, and neither would accept the other's nominee. The rigorists elected Majorinus who was succeeded by Donatus, giving the movement its name. The Donatists appealed to Constantine to decide who would be the real bishop of Carthage. Christians expected Constantine to be the arbiter of all religious disputes. It was simply part of the emperor's job. Harold A. Drake says that, \\"since the Jovian dynasty when Diocletian established the empire as one expressly based on divine support, the lack of consensus on religious matters was no small thing.\\"H. A. Drake, LAMBS INTO LIONS: EXPLAINING EARLY CHRISTIAN INTOLERANCE, Past & Present, Volume 153, Issue 1, November 1996, Pages 3–36, https://doi.org/10.1093/past/153.1.3 Constantine had already appointed a council at Rome under Pope Miltiades in 313 to deal with the issue of Donatism, and in 314, he also appointed an appeals commission that met at Arles to sort out who should be the rightful bishop. The commission found in favor of the Catholic bishop. The Donatists rejected the commission's findings and refused compromise. Therefore, Tilley says, \\"it became Constantine's imperial and religious duty\\" to impose acceptance. Constantine responded with moderate to severe repression. The first Donatist' martyr stories come from the years 317 to 321. Tilley indicates this was a response of the state to the need for public order and was also a specifically Roman response from the emperor's need to keep the pax deorum (‘the benevolence of gods’) – the peace between Heaven and earth. Constantine's persecution of these Christians was no more successful than Diocletian's had been, and in 321, Constantine acknowledged failure and cancelled the laws against the Donatists. For the next 75 years, both parties existed, often directly alongside each other, with a double line of bishops for the same cities. French archaeology has shown the north African landscape of this time period became \\"covered with a white robe of churches\\" as Catholics and Donatists competed for the loyalty of the people. This eventually led to a second phase of persecution and the end of the Donatists. Arianism and the Council of Nicea John Kaye characterizes the conversion of Constantine, and the council of Nicea that Constantine called, as two of the most important things to ever happen to the Christian church. Throughout his reign, Constantine's involvement with the church was dominated by its many conflicts defining orthodoxy versus heterodoxy and heresy. Michele R. Salzman indicates heresy was a higher priority than pagans for most Christians of the fourth and fifth centuries including Constantine.Salzman, Michele Renee. \\"The Evidence for the Conversion of the Roman Empire to Christianity in Book 16 of the 'Theodosian Code.'\\" Historia: Zeitschrift Für Alte Geschichte, vol. 42, no. 3, 1993, pp. 362–378. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/4436297. Accessed 2 June 2020. The worst of these heresies was the 56-year long Arian controversy with its debate of Trinitarian formulas. Donatism was a 'schism' (differences were over practices not doctrine) that was geographically limited to northern Africa; Arianism, on the other hand, was seen as an actual heresy: wrong belief. Arians believed the Father, Son and Holy Ghost were not equals. Most fourth and fifth century church controversies centered on the nature of Christ and his exact relation to God and man. Unlike Donatism, Arianism was spread throughout much of the empire, including among Germanic tribes, like the Visigoths, who were just converting. While it is generally accepted that Arianism began in 318, William Telfer writes that dating its beginning is highly problematic.Telfer, W. \\"WHEN DID THE ARIAN CONTROVERSY BEGIN?” The Journal of Theological Studies, vol. 47, no. 187/188, 1946, pp. 129–142. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/23952690. Accessed 26 July 2020. Kaye says it started in Alexandria, between the bishops Arius and Alexander, and quickly spread through Egypt and Libya and the other Roman provinces. Bishops engaged in \\"wordy warfare,\\" and the people divided into parties, while the pagans ridiculed them all. At the center of the controversy was Athanasius who became the \\"champion of orthodoxy\\" in Alexander's place. Constantine got news of the conflict sometime before his last war with Licinius, and was deeply distressed by it. After fruitless letter writing and the sending of other bishops to promote reconciliation, Constantine called for all church leaders to convene in 325 in Nicea in Bithynia (in present-day Turkey) to settle the issue. Constantine presided at the council. Kaye references Sozomen as saying Constantine opened with a speech in which he exhorted the bishops as friends and ministers to resolve conflict and embrace peace. Sozomen says the bishops accordingly broke out in mutual accusation. Constantine mediated, occasionally severely corrected, persuaded and praised, and eventually brought them to agreement. The result was the Nicene Creed, from which five bishops abstained. They were banished for a time, then eventually returned. Athanasius was then ousted from his bishopric in Alexandria in 336 by the Arians, forced into exile, and lived much of the remainder of his life in a cycle of forced movement as power went back and forth between the two groups. The controversy became political after Constantine's death. Athanasius died in 373, but his orthodox teaching was a major influence in the West, and on Theodosius, who became ruler in 381. The Nicene creed remained the official creed of the church.

Most programming languages require the ellipsis to be written as a series of periods; a single (Unicode) ellipsis character cannot be used.  Ranges  In some programming languages (including Ada, Perl, Ruby, Apache Groovy, Kotlin, Haskell, and Pascal), a shortened two-dot ellipsis is used to represent a range of values given two endpoints; for example, to iterate through a list of integers between 1 and 100 inclusive in Perl: :\`foreach (1..100)\` In Ruby the \`...\` operator denotes a half-open range, i.e. that includes the start value but not the end value. In Rust the \`..=\` operator denotes an inclusive range for cases in matches and the \`..\` operator represents a range not including the end value. Perl and Ruby overload the \\"..\\" operator in scalar context as a flip-flop operator - a stateful bistable Boolean test, roughly equivalent to \\"true while x but not yet y\\", similarly to the \\",\\" operator in sed and AWK.perlop - perldoc.perl.org The GNU Compiler Collection has an extension to the C and C++ language to allow case ranges in switch statements: switch(u) { case 0 ... 0x7F : putchar(c); break; case 0x80 ... 0x7FF : putchar(0xC0 + c>>6); putchar( 0x80 + c&0x3f); break; case 0x800 ... 0xFFFF : putchar(0xE0 + c>>12); putchar( 0x80 + (c>>6)&0x3f); putchar( 0x80 + (c>>12) ); break; default: error(\\"not supported!\\"); } Delphi / Turbo Pascal / Free Pascal: var FilteredChars: set of [#0..#32,#127,'a'..'z']; var CheckedItems: set of [4,10..38,241,58]; In the Unified Modeling Language (UML), a two-character ellipsis is used to indicate variable cardinality of an association. For example, a cardinality of 1..* means that the number of elements aggregated in an association can range from 1 to infinity (a usage equivalent to Kleene plus).

At 20 kilometres/12.4 miles, it is the longest river entirely in the Vale of Glamorgan.Environment Agency - The Thaw and Cadoxton - Catchment Abstraction Management Survey Course Its source is in the hills just south of the M4 Motorway near Llanharry. It flows in a generally south-eastern direction through the town of Cowbridge, then turns southward and reaches the Bristol Channel at Breaksea Point, south of Aberthaw. Environment The river supports healthy populations of a variety of fish. However, several stretches of the river no longer support a European water vole population, despite having a once sizeable population. Unlike many rivers in south Wales, the Thaw was never subject to much pollution, except at its mouth which was diverted to feed the Aberthaw Power Station. In the last century, there has been a slight decline in the river's biodiversity. Its major tributary, the Kenson River, is polluted in its lower reaches due to agricultural run-off and effluents leaking from nearby quarries. The river is also a popular site for various kinds of recreation, accessible for much of its course, much of which is used for agriculture. There are many archaeological sites along the river. The river was once large enough for the villages and settlements along its banks to have access to shipping and thus the sea. Its estuary was once wider, but silting and impoundments have reduced its size considerably. Tributaries The Kenson River is the Thaw's largest tributary The river picks up many tributaries along its course, making its watershed the largest in the Vale of Glamorgan. The Kenson River is by far the largest tributary of the river. It has a total length of 2 miles and is formed at the confluence of two other rivers, the Waycock and the Nant Llancarfan. It runs southwest through the village of Penmark and near Rhoose and Cardiff International Airport. The Kenson is also known for its good angling, and had many tributaries of its own. These include the River Waycock which is itself 9 kilometres long, and flows through Dyffryn and Penmark. It has many sources between Wenvoe and St Lythans, and meets the Nant Llancarfan at Penmark. The Nant Llancarfan rises at Bonvilston, flowing southward for 5 miles. A stream known as the Factory Brook is a mile and a half long. It flows east, to meet the Thaw at Cowbridge. The Nant y Stepsau is 2 miles long. Rising between the villages of Llanmaes and Eglwys Brewis, it flows northeast. The Nant Tre-gof is a minor tributary of the river. It starts near the small village of Llantrithyd near the A48 and flows southwest for nearly 3 miles, through the hamlet of Treguff (this name is a corruption of Tre-gof). Its confluence with the Thaw is nearly opposite that of the Nant y Stepsau. The Nant Aberthin is the smallest named tributary. It flows through the small village of Aberthin, and is under a mile long. Its actual name is Nant y Berthyn - Aberthin is a corruption of this name. An unnamed brook flows through St Athan. Its length is approximately 1.5 miles, and it joins the Thaw near its mouth. The Nant Llanmihangel is over a mile long. It comes from Llanmihangel, and flows into the river at Llandough, south of Llanblethian. There are many insignificant, and thus unnamed, tributaries of the Thaw. One flows in the same direction of the Thaw for a mile or so, and flows amongst a dismantled railway and power cables. The stream in question meets the Thaw near the village of Flemingston and is very near the Nant Tre-gof. Flooding On 31 October 1998, water levels in the river reached its highest recorded level and the river flooded, causing significant damage to 4 properties in Cowbridge, 4 in Aberthin, and 17 in Llanblethian. The flooding was caused by flood water over-topping the banks of main rivers and ordinary watercourses, and restrictions to flow in channels and surcharging of drains. Estuary The artificial mouth of the river at Aberthaw The river meets the Bristol Channel at a shingle beach called Leys Beach, at Breaksea Point, one of the southernmost points of Wales. It flows through the village of Aberthaw. At its mouth is the Aberthaw Power Station, which is split into two complexes, Aberthaw A and Aberthaw B, on the opposite sides of the river. When Aberthaw A first opened in February 1966, it was the most advanced power station in the world. Aberthaw B opened in the 1970s. The power station currently burns coal with a generating capacity 1455 megawatts, and proposals for a nuclear power station on the site were rejected due to close proximity to Cardiff. Aberthaw A was subsequently demolished in 1995. For centuries, an active, albeit small, port stood at the river's mouth, and provided docking facilities. In those days, the river was large and navigable by ships for some considerable distance; however, the river began silting up some time in the late 18th century. Its flow and size were so badly degraded that shipping was restricted to a few small vessels, but by 1850 it was of no use at all to shipping as it had become no more than a large stream. The port was abandoned altogether by 1900. The Thaw was used to cool the power station, which led to a small amount of thermal pollution in the river's mouth. The estuary is not natural, because the river was diverted into a channel to allow the power station to be built, similar to the Cadoxton River a few miles east. The river's original mouth was actually slightly further east of here; many lagoons, small pools and salt-marshes are left over from its once large estuary.

Scott (ca. 1789 – September 18, 1854 East Hampton, Suffolk County, New York) was an American lawyer and politician from New York. Life He was for more than twenty years a justice of the New York City Marine Court. In May 1840, Scott and Effingham Schieffelin were removed from office on the allegation that the Court had supplied foreigners with letters of naturalization before their legal term of probation (5 years) had expired. After the removal, Scott published An Appeal to the People, from the Decision of the Senate, in the Case of the Removal of the Justices of the Marine Court (New York City, 1840; 30 pages). Half a year later, Scott was elected to the State Senate. Scott was a Democratic member of the New York State Senate (1st D.) from 1841 to 1844, sitting in the 64th, 65th, 66th and 67th New York State Legislatures. In 1846, he was appointed by Gov. Silas Wright as Recorder of New York City, the last holder of this office appointed by the governor and confirmed by the State Senate, remaining in office until the end of 1848. On January 1, 1849, he was succeeded by Frederick A. Tallmadge, the first Recorder elected by popular ballot. Scott lived at 11 Albion Place in New York City, but died in East Hampton, Long Island, returning from his summer vacation. His remains were deposited in the receiving vault of the 2nd Street Protestant Episcopal Cemetery and later transferred to the Trinity Church Cemetery and Mausoleum.

It can either be made from clay or the lower end of a bamboo tree which is left after the main part falls or is cut off (Assamese: বাহঁৰ মূঢ়া). Detail about this musical instrument is available in xobdo. Description The instrument is shaped like a half moon. It is believed that initially instruments of this type developed from the hard shells of fruits like coconut, and then similar shapes were made from potter's clay. These instruments imitate the sounds of animals and birds and produce a flute-like sound. In ancient China a similar instrument was called a Xun. History The Xutuli is believed to be brought by the Sino-Tibetan groups mainly the Sadiyal Kacharis(Chutias, Deoris, Sonowals, Morans) who brought the instrument along with them from their ancestral lands. The number of holes in the Assamese Xutuli indicates that the Sadiyal Kacharis probably arrived from the Huang He plains before 1600 BC, as the Xuns were standardised with five holes during the Shang dynasty. From the shape and sound of Xutuli, it can be deduced that this instrument imitates birds. In Assamese folk culture, people believe that the sound of Xutuli invites rain. The sound of Xutuli is also associated as the symbol of respectable hermits, lady in sorrow, or heroes at the end of their strength. Use In Bohag Bihu, Xutuli has an importance of its own. Initially, the cowboys (Ggorokhiya lora) used Xutuli as a toy, because of ease of construction . Xutuli is played by both boys and girls in Bihu, but most importantly Xutuli is an indispensable part of Jeng Bihu and Bihuwati dances, and predominantly played by girls. Nowadays every Bihuwati is desired be an accomplished Xutuli player.
