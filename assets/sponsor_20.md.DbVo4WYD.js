Short history of the literary society Coat of arms of the Dutch Tak family Introduction The Nil volentibus arduum literary society attempted to dictate the terms of the Dutch literary world and to exert intellectual influence by imposing the poetic rules of Aristotle, Horace, and Nicolas Boileau-Despr√©aux. This society of francophilesNote that an article published Wednesday 16 June 2010 in Le Soir, presented a polemic saying that this group of intellectuals and defenders of French culture were, on the contrary, the enemies of both it and the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise: :Nil volentibus arduum... \\"√Ä c≈ìur vaillant, rien d‚Äôimpossible\\" (To a valiant heart, nothing is impossible ) was the Latin adage with which Bart De Wever introduced his victory speech on election night. The name also refers to a group of poets founded in Amsterdam in the second half of the 17th century, whose goal was to weaken the dictatorial power of the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise in the world of theatre in Europe. Bart De Wever did not evoke this sort of anti-francophone sentiment... (article signed Dirk Vanoverbeke). ardently defended French letters in the United Provinces, and as Jan Fransen: :In their critiques the members of ‚ÄúNil (volentibus arduum)‚Äù reproached their adversaries with not understanding even the French they translate. French tragedy and theatre came closest to their ideal; they introduced it with or without force onto the Dutch scene. With this goal, they translated and adapted classic works by Pierre Corneille, Jean Racine and Moli√®re and corrected these great poets without flinching. Historic and literary context In 1669, in Amsterdam, a literary discussion on the subject of theatre led to the creation of a new artistic society, named '. Until then, the Amsterdam scene had been in the grip of glassmaker (vitrier) and writer Jan Vos (1610/1611-1667), who among other points expressed with the adage ' (¬´ La vision pr√©c√®de la parole ¬ª, (seeing precedes speaking)) the idea that visual elements were more expressive than words. Vos was able to give himself over completely to his predilection for the visual thanks to his contacts in the Amsterdam government, who commissioned the stained-glass windows of the new Paleis op de Dam in 1655, as well as the large open-air living sculptures organized to greet important visitors. He also conceived ballets and theatrical productions, both his own and by other authors. His own works abounded in dramatical scenes. As regent of the , Vos exercised considerable influence over its programming. To make special effects, like rapid changes of scenery and flying movements, possible‚Äîsince the public adored such spectacles‚Äîhe renovated the theatre in 1664‚Äì1665. But the popularity of Vos' work also rested on scenes of horror with elements like assassinations, hangings, dismemberment and other dark cruelties. Emotion and violence habitually constituted ingredients in his pieces: not because they rejoiced in such spectacles, but because his objective was to show the dangers of intemperance.

Start (November 3, 1877 ‚Äì December 15, 1956), born in Holmes Township, Ohio, was the Republican mayor of Toledo from 1936‚Äì40. He is the namesake for Roy C. Start High School in Toledo, Ohio. Start also founded the West Toledo YMCA. Early career Start (1877‚Äì1956) graduated from Ohio Northern University in 1899. After college he moved to Toledo where he served as a clerk in a drug store owned by Paul Loesser. A year later, in 1902, he opened his own drug store on the corner of Franklin Avenue and Cherry Street in Toledo. Later he opened two more drug stores in the city, along Sylvania Avenue under the name of the Start Drug Company. City Council and Mayor In 1935 he was elected to city council and was also elected mayor by the newly rechartered city council. He served as the first mayor under a new City Manager style government. He was re-elected in 1937 by one vote over Ollie Czelusta to both city council. He was then elected to the role of mayor. In 1939 he announced that he would not seek re-election to a third term on council, thus ending his run as mayor. Notably, in 1938 the \\"All Negro\\" fire company was formed by Mayor Start. The company operated the former No. 8 station at Indiana Avenue and Division Street, in Toledo, Ohio. It was disbanded 11 months later due to court battles by disgruntled whites. Later Public Service In May 1942 Start was elected to serve as President of the Toledo Council of Churches. He was chairman of the board of trustees of Plymouth Congregational Church and the superintendent of its Sunday School. He was a member of several civic and masonic organizations, including the Barton Smith Lodge F&AM;, Collingwood Chapel, Scottish Rite, Zenobia Shrine, West Toledo Exchange Club, West Toledo Commerce Club, Municipal League, Ohio Congregational Church Union, Lucas County Pharmaceutical Association. He was also a member of the Lafayette Lyttle Commandery Knights Templar. Shortly before his death he was honored by the West Toledo branch of the YMCA which he founded. Lasting Influence Start's role as a businessman and public servant would inspire other businessmen in Toledo to take up public service. Gilbert Siegel a Republican running for Mayor of Toledo and also a drug store owner like Start, was quoted as saying, \\"Yes Sir... I do expect to win. The Republican party has been successful in running druggists for mayor. Mayors Fred Mery and Roy Start were both druggists. Drugstores can be potent political factors. They are strategically located. Many people frequent drugstores, to buy, to ask advice.\\" This was more than 12 years after Start had died, proof that his legacy was lasting in the Toledo and Northwest Ohio area. After his death, the Toledo school district named a new high school (Roy C. Start High School) after him, which opened in 1962. It is adjacent to the West Toledo YMCA that Start founded.

He played both guard positions during his playing days; he was a standout college player for the USC Upstate Spartans before moving to Australia and forging a successful four-year career with the Lakeside Lightning of the State Basketball League (SBL). In 2012, he returned to USC Upstate, joining the Spartans men's basketball team as an assistant coach under his father, Eddie, the head coach. High school career Payne began his high school career at Greensboro Day School in Greensboro, North Carolina, where he was a member of the school's state championship team as a sophomore in 2001‚Äì02. In 2002, he transferred to Spartanburg High School in Spartanburg, South Carolina, where he was named team captain of the basketball team. As a senior in 2003‚Äì04, he averaged 14 points, four assists and four rebounds per game while earning All-Region and All-State honors. College career As a freshman at USC Upstate in 2004‚Äì05, Payne saw action in 31 games while receiving 16 starting assignments. He ranked fourth on the team in scoring with 8.6 points, and with 2.5 rebounds and 2.6 assists per game, he helped the Spartans win the Peach Belt Conference regular season championship. As a sophomore in 2005‚Äì06, Payne played in all 30 games while starting 28 times and ranking third on the team and 20th in the Peach Belt Conference with 11.8 points per game. He also averaged 2.9 rebounds and 3.2 assists per game, and led the league with a 2.04 assist-to-turnover ratio. His contributions helped lead the Spartans to the 2006 NCAA Division II Men's Basketball Tournament after winning the Peach Belt Conference Tournament. As a junior in 2006‚Äì07, Payne played in all 28 games for the Spartans, starting 27 times and averaging 11.2 points per game, good for third on the team. He also averaged 3.1 rebounds and 3.3 assists per game. On February 21, 2007, he scored a then career-high 24 points against Lander University. After participating in the NCAA Division II Men's Basketball Tournament in back-to-back seasons, the Spartans earned promotion into the NCAA Division I for the 2007‚Äì08 season. As a senior that year, Payne earned Atlantic Sun All-Academic honors and was named an Academic All-American. He picked up USC Upstate student-athlete of the year honors in 2007‚Äì08 after totalling 448 points, garnered A-Sun Player of the Week honors on December 24, 2007, and was named to the All-Tournament teams at the BP Top of the World Classic and the State Farm Insurance Sun Bowl Tournament.

Professional career Lakeside Lightning (2009‚Äì2012) =2009 season: SBL Championship and Grand Final MVP= Coming out of college, Payne had some European teams interested in him but received no offers, so he landed in Australia's second-tier division, joining the Lakeside Lightning of the State Basketball League (SBL) for the 2009 season. He played well upon arrival and quickly grew a target on his back. He led the league in scoring for most of the season and guided the Lightning to the minor premiership with a 22‚Äì4 record. He went on to lead the Lightning through to the SBL Grand Final, where behind Payne's 29 points, Lakeside defeated the Perry Lakes Hawks 85‚Äì77 to win the championship. Payne was subsequently named Grand Final MVP, and earned SBL All-Star Five honors alongside teammate Jarrad Prue. =2010 season: Another grand final appearance= Payne returned to the Lightning in 2010 and ranked second on the team and fourth in the league with 22.8 points per game during the regular season. He once again helped the Lightning win the minor premiership with a 21‚Äì5 record and guided them through to their second straight SBL Grand Final. However, despite Payne top-scoring for Lakeside with 22 points, the Lightning were defeated 107‚Äì96 by the Willetton Tigers. =2011 season: Another minor premiership= Payne returned to Lakeside for a third season in 2011, but got off to a slow start to begin the campaign as he scored seven points in the season opener and four points a week later. Payne reached double-figures with 15 points against the Perth Redbacks in the third contest of the season, which began a streak of 24 straight games of double-digit scoring for Payne as he finished the regular season with 23 consecutive games of 20 or more points. Payne posted a new career high with 50 points on July 1 in a 100‚Äì86 victory over the Rockingham Flames. He connected on a season-best 19 field goals (27 attempts) against the Flames, while also connecting on a season-high 11 three- pointers (13 attempts). The Lightning won 16 consecutive games to finish the regular season, earning their third straight minor premiership with a 24‚Äì2 record. Payne led the team and ranked fourth in the league in scoring at 27.8 points per game during the regular season. The Lightning's quest for a third straight grand final appearance ended with a 2‚Äì1 defeat at the hands of Perry Lakes in the semi-finals. In Game 1 of the series, a match the Lightning lost 78‚Äì76, Payne led Lakeside with 27 points despite missing a significant part of the game after suffering an eye injury in the second quarter. The Lightning went on to even the series with a 92‚Äì88 Game 2 victory, but Payne picked up a leg injury in the third quarter and did not return, eventually requiring treatment in hospital. Payne subsequently missed Game 3, as the Hawks went on to prevail with an 84‚Äì71 win; the 24-hour recovery time between games proved nowhere near enough for Payne. At Basketball WA's end-of-season awards night, Payne was named in the SBL All-Star Five. =2012 season: Injury-plagued season= In 2012, Payne returned to the Lightning for a fourth season. He struggled throughout the regular season with injury, missing six games as a result. The Lightning finished the regular season in second place with a 22‚Äì4 record, going on to sweep the Goldfields Giants in the quarter-finals and facing the Cockburn Cougars in the semi-finals. After losing Game 1 against Cockburn, the Lightning evened the series in Game 2 despite losing Payne early in the contest to an ankle injury. Payne subsequently missed Game 3, with Lakeside bowing out of the playoffs at the hands of the Cougars with a 102‚Äì92 loss. At Basketball WA's end-of-season awards night, Payne was named in the SBL All-Star Five for the third time in four years. In 116 games over four seasons for the Lightning, Payne averaged 24.4 points, 4.2 rebounds, 3.1 assists and 1.6 steals per game. Coaching career Following the 2012 SBL season, Payne returned to the United States and joined the USC Upstate Spartans men's basketball team coaching staff as an assistant coach for the 2012‚Äì13 season. Wanting to enter into coaching, he joined USC Upstate due to the connections with him having played his college career there and because his father, Eddie, was the team's head coach. He continued on with the program alongside his father in 2013‚Äì14 and 2014‚Äì15. In January 2015, Payne was inducted into the USC Upstate Hall of Fame, becoming the 14th person affiliated with the men's basketball program at USC Spartanburg/USC Upstate to go into the Hall of Fame, and the first who played at the Division I level. Payne was not retained as an assistant coach of USC Upstate for the 2015‚Äì16 season. Personal Payne is the son of Eddie and Ann Payne, both of whom are basketball coaches. His father is the head coach of the USC Upstate Spartans men's basketball team, while his mother was the head coach of the women's teams at Alabama, Charlotte and Belmont Abbey. Eddie also played college basketball at Wake Forest and professionally in France.

He served in the North Carolina State Senate and held public offices in Florida. Biography Beard, only son of Lewis and Susannah (Dunn) Beard, was born in Salisbury, N. C., June 14, 1797, and died in Tallahassee, Fla., July 15, 1876, aged 79 years. He graduated from Yale College in 1817. Returning to his native place at graduation, he was elected the next year, just after reaching his majority, and without opposition, to the North Carolina State Legislature, where he took at once a leading position. In the winter of 1820 he married Anna M Kelly, and settled on a plantation near Salisbury. In 1826 he was elected without opposition to the North Carolina State Senate, but declined a reelection for private reasons. In 1832, although previously a Federalist, he espoused the Nullification theory, and in the three succeeding years was again a member of the State Senate.Yale Obituary His wife having died in 1830, he was married in the summer of 1838 to Maria W. Anderson, of St. Augustine, Fla., and the next year went there to reside. In 1840 he was appointed Clerk of the U. S District Court for East Florida, and in 1842, U.S. Marshal for the same district, which office he held until Florida was admitted as a State three years later. In Jan. 1847, he was elected State Register of Public Lands (and ex officio Superintendent of Schools), and removed his residence to Tallahassee. This office he resigned in the summer of 1850, on his reluctant acceptance of the Democratic nomination for Congress. He was defeated, but a few months afterwards was elected Comptroller of Public Accounts, which position he resigned in 1854 to accept the agency of the Apalachicola Land Company. He was a member of the Florida Secession Convention in 1861, and during the war which followed contributed all of his power to make the cause of the South a success. He was again appointed to the Comptroller's office in 1866. In 1869 he was attacked by vertigo, from which combined with neuralgia he was a great sufferer until a few months before his death In all relations he maintained a spotless character for personal and official integrity. His first wife left two sons and three daughters, and by his second wife, who survived him, he had two sons and a daughter.

His primary research focus was the various uses and techniques of propaganda and persuasion employed by governments that were considered enemies of the United States. He taught at Michigan State College and other institutions. After the Second World War he was involved with research on propaganda and mass persuasion on a mass audience while also questioning the methods used by the Nazi propaganda theorist Franz Six. Life Smith was a student of Harold D. Lasswell at the University of Chicago and in 1933 earned a Ph.D. in political science and economics. From 1933 to 1936 he was a graduate student and from 1934 to 1936 research assistant at the city's Department of Political Science. From 1938 to 1941 he worked as an Instructor of Economics at New York University. From 1942 to 1943 he was a lecturer at the American University in Washington, DC. After leaving American University he again went to work at the University of Chicago, where he would later become Instructor at the Social Science Division and Research Associate. He took on a number of posts throughout his academic career; among these many posts he was to become Instructor to the US Government. One of his students was Morris Janowitz, who became a senior propaganda analyst at the Organization and Propaganda Section in the U.S. Department of Justice from 1941 to 1943. Smith also accepted an academic appointment at the University of Chicago from 1939 to 1944. He was also Associate Editor of the journal Public Opinion Quarterly. From 1941 to 1944 he worked as an analyst in the Organization and Propaganda Analysis Section of the United States Department of Justice War Division. He was mainly concerned with countermeasures to curb anti-democratic propaganda. From 1943 to 1944 he was Senior Intelligence Officer of the Foreign Economic Administration and, in addition to other social scientists, he was a main research analyst at the Research and Analysis Branch of the Office of Strategic Services (which would later become the CIA) which studied the effects of mass persuasion. Subsequently, he was Attach√© and US Political Advisor for the Federal Republic of Germany at the Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force in France. In 1945 he was involved in the search for Nazi propaganda theorist Franz Six and was apparently involved in his actual interrogation after his capture. From 1946 to 1948 he was Chief of the Department Information Control Division at the Office of Military Government for Germany in Berlin. After the Second World War he worked as a lecturer again; in 1949-1950 he was associate professor at the Foreign Service Institute at the State Department in Washington, DC, but had to leave the post in the McCarthy era because of its supposedly \\"left-liberal\\" sentiments. Then from 1950 to 1963 he was appointed associate professor of political science at Michigan State College in East Lansing. In 1951 he became editor of the journal International Political Science Abstracts. Smith was married to Chitra R. Smith, a member of the Bureau of Social Science Research, and in 1952 they co-authored \\"International Communication and Political Warfare, An Annotated Bibliography\\". Smith was also a member of the American Political Science Association. He published in journals such as the International Social Science Bulletin, Public Opinion Quarterly, Journalism Quarterly and Psychological Bulletin. In the 1970s, Smith was author of an article about propaganda in the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. His later research focused on the science of political parties, public opinion, international relations and political behavior. Writings * with Harold D. Lasswell, Ralph D.

Kennedy Drive in Veterans Memorial Park in Bay City, Michigan. The building is also known as the Centre House (or Center House). It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. It is the oldest frame house still standing in Bay County. History Trombley House c. 1883 Medor and Joseph Trombley, both French-Canadian fur traders, settled in the Saginaw Valley in the early 1830s and purchased large tracts of land along the Saginaw River between what is now Twenty-third Street and Cass Avenue in Bay City. In 1835, they began construction on this house, hiring Nathan C. Case, a carpenter, to construct it. The house at that time was located on the east side of the river, at what is now 114-118 Webster Street. The house was completed in 1837. The Trombleys used the building as a house, as a place to conduct their trading business, and as an inn of sorts. In the early 1840s, the Trombleys sold the house to James McCormick, Medor Trombley's father-in-law. McCormick remodeled it into a family residence, and lived there until his death in 1846. His wife Ellen continued to live there until her death in 1854. Medor Trombley and his wife Sara McCormick Trombley moved in in 1847. After Ellen McCormick's death in 1854, Medor Trombley again took ownership of the house, and held onto it until 1899. During this time, the house also served as an inn or hotel, with out-of-town businessmen staying there. It was known variously as the \\"River House,\\" the \\"Big House,\\" or the \\"Centre House.\\" In 1899 the house passed to Mader's daughter Mary E. Rose. In 1905, she sold it to Frederick Johnson, and around this time the house was divided into three units. Over the next 75 years, the house changed ownership 12 more times. In 1981, the owner of the Trombley House wished to clear the site to make a parking lot for the adjacent business. Rather than being demolished, the house was ferried to the present location in Veterans Memorial Park on the other side of the Saginaw River. The current site more accurately reflects the original setting of the house when it was constructed than the original site, now substantially industrial in nature, did. The house is currently being renovated under the guidance of the Trombley/Centre House Committee. Description The Trombley House is a two-story rectangular frame Greek Revival structure, measuring 25-1/2 feet by 35-1/2 feet. It has a gabled roof. Each story of the front has five openings. The entrance is in the center, and is flanked with fluted pilasters and topped with a cornice. Trombley House Site According to McCormick family oral history, the original Webster Street location of the Trombley House was at the edge of extensive Indian mound containing skeletons, broken pottery, stone knives, stone axes, stone arrowheads, and stone spears. Some of these were donated by the McCormicks to several museums, including the Smithsonian Institution. Archaeological excavations at the site (designated 20BY70) were undertaken in 1981. These excavations found over 1000 historical artifacts, and also identified prehistoric artifacts. The prehistoric artifacts largely dated to the Late Woodland period (after 1000 AD, although some may be as early as pre-500 AD.

She was appointed to the role of Alternate Minister of Finance in the cabinet of Alexis Tsipras on 27 January 2015. She resigned from this role on 15 July 2015, before a significant vote on the terms of a bailout package in the Hellenic Parliament. She had been a Syriza Member of the Hellenic Parliament since May 2012, but defected to Popular Unity in September 2015.  Early life and education  Valavani was a student in Iraklio during the Greek military junta, and engaged in anti-regime activities under the auspices of the then-outlawed Communist Youth of Greece (KNE) and Communist Party of Greece (KKE), for which she was imprisoned in various facilities, including a five-month stretch in solitary confinement. In July 1974 after the end of the dictatorship, she was released from Korydallos Prison, whereupon she returned to her studies. Valavani is a graduate of the Athens University of Economics and Business.  Professional career  Valavani worked as a translator in an insurance company for 20 years, and from 1996 to 2005 was the director of a hotel in Crete.  Political career  Valavani took part in the activities of KKE and KNE during the generally more tolerant political atmosphere following the regime change, which allowed her to travel widely throughout Europe and to the United States. She left the KKE in 1989, disagreeing with its decision to serve in the unity government of Tzannis Tzannetakis. In 2007 she was invited to join the Syriza, and helped organize its activities in Crete. In 2009, she contested Athens B for Syriza and lost in a difficult election, afterwards devoting herself to campaigning for Syriza, working as a canvasser, author of pamphlets, and organizing rallies while engaging in dialogue with other leftist groups and writing opinion pieces for various left and centre-left newspapers. Valavani was first elected to the Hellenic Parliament representing Athens B for Syriza in May 2012; she was re-elected in June 2012 and again in the January 2015 election. Following the election of a Syriza-ANEL coalition on 25 January 2015, Valavani was appointed to the role of Alternate Minister of Finance within the Cabinet of Alexis Tsipras on 27 January. She is one of two Alternate Ministers in the Ministry of Finance (Greece), the other being Dimitris Mardas. She was responsible for taxation and overseeing privatisation. On 15 July 2015, Valavani resigned from her role as Alternate Minister of Finance in the Greek government, shortly before an important vote on a bailout package. In her resignation letter to Alexis Tsipras, she wrote that the \\"agreement is a tombstone\\" and that it was a \\"humiliation of government and country\\". Her mother withdrew ‚Ç¨200,000 from the National Bank of Greece before the imposition of capital controls. In September 2015, Valavani left Syriza and joined the Syriza split-away party, Popular Unity, alongside Zoi Konstantopoulou. During the September 2015 legislative election, Yanis Varoufakis, former Minister of Finance who Valavani worked under for several months, announced that he would be voting for Popular Unity and in particular supporting Valavani and Kostas Isychos in Athens B. Personal life In 1975, she married labour lawyer Dimos Tsaknias, with whom she had two children, a son and a daughter. Tsaknias, like his wife a Syriza (and former Communist) politician, died on 2 November 2014. On 8 March 2015 Valavani was admitted to an Athens hospital suffering the symptoms of pneumonia apparently brought on from stress.

Life Giliana Berneri was the second daughter of the eminent Italian anarchist and academic Camillo Berneri and his similarly focused wife Giovanna Berneri (born Giovanna Caleffi). Giliana and her sister were born in Tuscany, but the family fled to France in 1926 in order to escape the Fascist Mussolini government. The father's scathing anti-Fascist newspaper articles had marked the family out for persecution. In France he was unable to find permanent employment, and frequently went into hiding to avoid the unwelcome attentions of the Italian Security Services. Nevertheless, there was considerable solidarity among the political anti-Fascist exiles in Paris and eventually Giovanna, the girls' mother, was able to set up a fruit and vegetable shop in a popular quarter. Money continued to be short, but the family survived and the daughters' education was financed. Both of the daughters qualified as medical doctors. Giliana's specialisms became Pediatrics and Psychoanalysis. On 5 May 1937 her father was assassinated, together with his friend and fellow anarchist Francesco \\"Ciccio\\" Barbieri, in Barcelona. They were dragged off by a gang of a dozen men, and their bodies were found riddled with bullets the next day. Although the killers and the sequence of events in the hours before the killings were never precisely identified, it quickly became believed that Camillo Berneri had been murdered on Stalin's orders after his journalism had highlighted Soviet involvement in the Spanish Civil War. Although Giliana pursued her medical studies with continued energy, the circumstances of her father's death provided her with a compelling motivation to continue with her father's political work, and it is for her political activity that she is more widely remembered. In 1938 Giliana and her sister, Marie-Louise Berneri, took part in the production and publication of the review R√©vision, founded by Louis Mercier-Vega, Lucien Feuillade and Nicolas Lazar√©vitch. In 1940 she was involved in the successful campaign to have her comrade and fellow (originally Italian) anarchist Ernesto Bonomini released from a French internment camp - possibly Camp Vernet - and she may have accompanied Bonomini into political exile in the United States. War ended in May 1945 and Giliana returned to France and married her partner, (generally known as \\"Serge Ninn\\") while her sister stayed in London with her English anarchist husband Vernon Richards. During the war their mother had been arrested and deported first to Germany and then to Italy where she had spent most of the war under house arrest. At the first post war anarchist conference, which took place in May 1948 in Paris, the three of them were all present, each representing a different country. The mother was with the Italian delegation while her daughters represented respectively Britain and France. Giliane Berneri took French citizenship on 17 October 1947. She was active in the French libertarian movement until the mid 1950s. In the aftermath of the war she was among the founders of the French Anarchist Federation, along with Maurice Joyeux, Georges Fontenis, , Ren√©e Lamberet, Georges Vincey, , Paul Lapeyre, Maurice Laisant, Solange Dumont, Maurice Fayolle and Roger Caron. Giliane and her husband were drawn to the Paris-based Sacco and Vanzetti group, which developed into the Kronstadt group within the Anarchist Federation. In 1948 this group comprised \\"approximately twenty militants and sympathisers belonging to the university [of the Sorbonne], in the metallurgy, buildings, medical and hospital departments, focused the books and instruction\\"Dictionnaire international des militants anarchistes : notice biographique. including Georg K.

During the later 1950s Giliane Berneri became disillusioned by the internal quarrels affecting the French anarchist movement, and her activist contributions to it came to an end.

The aim of the operation was to breach Army defenses and enter, and potentially take, the government-held western half of the city.  The offensive  On 2 July, the major offensive was launched by two rebel coalitions, Fatah Halab and Ansar Sharia, the latter of which includes the Al- Qaeda-linked al-Nusra Front, with fighting focusing on the Jamiyat al-Zahra frontline. By the next day, the rebels seized some buildings in Jamiyat al- Zahra, but the advance was of no strategic importance and came at a cost of heavy casualties, with 35 rebels being killed amidst heavy air-strikes. At least 18 soldiers were killed in the fighting. In the evening, government troops managed to recapture the areas they lost. On 4 July, the Fatah Halab managed to seize the Scientific Research Center on Aleppo's western outskirts, thus overcoming the first major government fortification and potentially threatening government-held areas of Aleppo. Later during the day, government fighters launched a counter-attack against the Scientific Research Center, and managed to enter the eastern outskirts of the Center but were forced to retreat outside the complex's walls after heavy shelling. 12 more rebels and 12 soldiers were killed in the clashes. As of 5 July, the attack on Jamiyat al-Zahra had largely failed, while the military was still attempting to recapture the Center. On the evening of 6 July, a suicide bomber hit government positions in Jamiyat al-Zahra, leaving 25 government fighters dead. The ensuing fighting also left 19 rebels dead and opposition activists claimed rebel forces managed to capture several buildings. Fighting also continued at the Center. By 7 July, the renewed rebel attack on al-Zahra had been repelled, while the military reportedly used chlorine gas in an attempt to regain control of the Scientific Research Center. The opposition activist group the SOHR reported there were no casualties among the rebels since most of them were wearing gas masks.

It has a beach of the same nameNatural Landmarks Qatar Tourism and various archaeological sites. Since the 21st century it has functioned as a tourist site. Large parts of its territory are legally protected areas that are dedicated to a nature reserve for wild deer. Richard Serra's East-West/West- East sculpture was completed in Brouq Nature Reserve in 2014 at the behest of the Qatar Museums Authority. Etymology In Arabic, the word \\"ras\\" translates to \\"head\\", and in this context is used to refer to a cape. The other constituent, \\"abrouq\\", is derived from the nearby range of light-colored hills in the Zekreet Peninsula (also known as the Abrouq Peninsula). Its name is also spelled as Ras Broog. Location Ras Abrouq is a cape located on the tip of the Zekreet Peninsula near the city of Dukhan. It is 70 km west of the Qatari capital of Doha. Located south of Ras Abrouq is the village of Zekreet. Archaeology Ras Abrouq is one of the most extensive Neolithic sites in Qatar. It has one of the highest proportions of Ubaid potsherds in Qatar. Excavations in the 1970s revealed a ring-like structure, hearths, Ubaid pottery, cairns, and stone tools dating to the Neolithic period. Many fish bones and snail shells were also recovered.Abdul Nayeem (1998), p. 118. G.H. Smith, an excavator of the site, suggested that it was a seasonal encampment and that its inhabitants had trade relations with nearby civilizations. Further archaeological excavations yielded Barbar ceramics originating from the Dilmun civilization dating to the third millennium BC.Abdul Nayeem (1998), p. 197 A number of chambered cairns dating to the same period contained 108 beads made of stone and shell.Abdul Nayeem (1998), p. 211. Excavations conducted during the mid-20th century uncovered potsherds of Seleucid characteristic and a cairnfield consisting of 100 burial mounds dating to the 3rd century BC. The relatively large number of cairns suggest a sizable sea- faring community prevailed in the area during this period. Further excavations revealed a fishing station dating to c. 140 BC which was used by foreign vessels to dry fish during the Sasanian period. A number of stone structures and large quantities of fish bones were recovered from the site.

She was the daughter of Count Henri de M√©h√©renc de Saint-Pierre and Marie Espivent de La Villesboisnet, a \\"pure heiress of the Breton nobility\\" and born in a castle in the C√¥tes-d'Armo. By turns a nun, reporter, novelist, author of poetry and youth fiction, Saint-Pierre was a global voyager and hunter travelling across North and South America and Australia who wrote enthusiastically about her adventures.  Biography  Deciding as a young girl against marriage, Vefa (short for Genevi√®ve) chose instead to pursue the only option available for an unmarried young woman of her time: religion. She joined a convent associated with the Oblates of Saint Francis de Sales in Brittany, located in northwestern France, and remained a nun for 15 years. It was in that religious capacity, during one or two missions to Ecuador, that she gained a taste for travel and adventure. In 1905, Saint-Pierre left convent life without ever having made her final vows. To feed her need to travel, she left Brittany alone for North America - United States and Canada - where she renewed her passion for hunting (reportedly, she had received her first shotgun for her tenth birthday). Soon her exploits became legend; she killed a boar, as well as a moose that charged her, and grizzly bears, among others. It was on this trip that she met others from the Brittany region of France who had made a new home in Canada. As Saint-Pierre toured the world, she was also known to explore Quito, Ecuador in 1899, and she journeyed to Sydney, Australia in 1928. In 1910, at 38 years of age, she married Joseph-Marie Potiron de Boisfleury, but the marriage failed, lasting only three months. In France, Countess Saint-Pierre is also known for having owned the Menez Kamm manor since 1908 when she bought it. There, from 1970 to 1976, she sponsored various Breton movements, both Catholic and communist. A vigorous promoter of the Breton language (which is of Celtic origin), she is quoted as saying, \\"Bilingualism is a huge advantage! Children must be taught Breton and then they will learn English in three or four months.\\" She was known to translate Breton language works into French, with the aim of promoting national awareness of her regional language and culture. She was known to be a close friend of philosopher Yann Fouere.Yann Fouere, La Patrie interdite : Histoire d'un Breton, France-Empire, 1987, p. 125 et 410 In 1930, she was admitted to the community in Brittany known as Goursez Vreizh as a bard under a new name Brug ar Menez Du (Heather of the Black Mountains). In 1949, she was the first to use a bilingual notarized agreement in France, written in both French and Breton. After Saint-Pierre's death in 1967, the Menez Kamm cultural center flourished for some years, but despite all the dedication and hard work to keep the manor open as a place to live and learn Breton ways, financial difficulties increased, and in October 1976, the center closed. The property was then returned to the Saint-Pierre family and, as of 2018, the manor and its land had become a farm.

As a lieutenant Pouzet served as drill instructor and mentor to the young Jean Lannes, with whom he forged a lifelong friendship. He served with the Army of the Eastern Pyrenees in the campaigns against Spain (1793-1794) and became a battalion commander by 1795. He then transferred to the Army of Italy, with which he fought in the Italian campaigns. In September 1800 he was given command of a battalion of the Consular Guard.

Parker Crowell and Walter Lancaster.https://www.nps.gov/nr/feature/places/pdfs/13000169.pdf It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2013. Description and history The Phi Gamma Delta House is located on the west side of College Avenue, at the southwestern edge of the University of Maine campus, and just east of the Stillwater River. It is the southernmost of a series of fraternity and sorority houses that line College Avenue. It is a large 2-1/2 story brick Tudor Revival structurem with a side-gable slate roof and an asymmetrical projecting front-gable entry section. A second gable section projects from the rear at the building's northern end. The exterior is dark brick laid in common bond, with occasional glazed and rough-cut bricks adding texture. Windows are varied in size and dimensions. The projecting entry section has an asymmetrical roof line that is two stories at the left, and slopes down to the first floor on the right, joining a slightly-projecting gabled section where the door is located. The public spaces of the interior, especially the main living and dining areas, are richly decorated. The house was built in 1925 to satisfy an overwhelming need for additional housing at the school, which then had only two male dormitories. The state legislature authorized the school to guarantee construction loans for fraternity houses in 1903, a step that helped alleviate its housing problems at that time. This house is the only house built under that program that is still in use by the original fraternity, and is the school's only Tudor Revival fraternity house.

High school career During high school, Clear played football and basketball at Central High School in Memphis, Tennessee. As a power forward on his high school basketball team, he averaged 12 points and 4 rebounds a game for a team that ended with a record of 21‚Äì9 and finish fourth in the state. On the football team he played tight end and defensive line. For his junior season in 2009, he hauled in a total of 26 receptions, for 412 receiving yards, and 2 touchdown receptions. As a defensive lineman he made 62 tackles and 11 sacks on the season. The following year, he amassed 18 catches, 250 receiving yards, 6 receiving touchdowns at tight end, as well as, 60 tackles and 8 sacks on defense. He finished his senior year ranked as the tenth overall defensive line prospect by Sporting News Top 100 for the class of 2011. College career Freshman season Coming out of high school, Clear committed to Tennessee. As a true freshman in 2011, he played tight end and special teams. Against Middle Tennessee in week 10 he made his only catch of the season for 4 yards. He received his first start during week 12 against Vanderbilt. On May 25, 2012, Tennessee head football coach Derek Dooley announced that Clear would be dismissed from Tennessee. This came after he was charged with felony theft for stealing a laptop from a member of the Vol's baseball team. Before he was kicked off the team, he was expected to be the second tight end on the depth chart behind future NFL Player Mychal Rivera. Sophomore season On November 27, 2012, Clear officially committed to play tight end for Texas A&M; University. Due to NCAA\`s student transfer guidelines, Clear had to sit out his entire sophomore season as well as lose a year of eligibility. Since he wouldn't receive a scholarship until he was eligible, Clear transferred to Arizona Western College for his sophomore year. Junior season After attending Arizona Western College and sitting out his sophomore season, he finally debuted for Texas A&M; but ended up having a mediocre season for coach Kevin Sumlin.

After the combine, the Pittsburgh Steelers scheduled a pre-draft visit with him and attended his pro day. A lot of scouts were skeptical due to the incident at Tennessee, concern with weight issues, and his lack of playing time throughout his collegiate career. Pittsburgh Steelers As expected, Clear went undrafted in the 2015 NFL Draft.

The film begins as a personal journey of filmmaker Mary Healey, who is also Catholic. Through key players in the scandal, including victims, whistle-blower priests and a senior ranking U.S. Cardinal who is called upon by the Vatican to control an ever-growing storm, Holy Water-Gate brings the viewer deep within the institutional mind of the U.S. Catholic Church: a powerful establishment that not only failed the victims for many years by not acknowledging their abuse, but also enabled some priests to continue to abuse more children by relocating them in other parishes. This intensely personal and political story investigates the crisis and exposes the reluctance within the U.S. mainstream media for decades to report sexual abuse crimes against children by priests.

Reviews and awards \\"Director/writer/producer Mary Healey and co-producer Louise Rosen use the abuse that took place in Rhode Island during the 1980s and '90s as a springboard to investigating the Catholic Church's penchant for covering up accusations of sexual abuse by members of the clergy. A pastor in Cranston, Father James Silva abused children for years before his crimes were brought to the attention of the Diocese of Providence. Transferred to 12 different parishes over the course of the next 16 years, Father Silva's patterns of abuse continued unabated, the parents at each new parish never realizing that their churchgoing children were in the care of a genuine sexual predator. In another shocking case, a priest reported to police by his two victims was assigned a scant six months of therapy and assigned to a new parish after the official report mysteriously vanished and no official charges were made. In many cases, when victims' advocates, other priests, or reporters attempted to reveal similar cases to the public, they were repeatedly blocked and/or harassed by church officials and‚Äîin some cases‚Äîthe perpetrators themselves. Why is the Catholic Church willing to work so hard to keep these cases from the public, especially when they seem well aware that by doing so they're putting more children directly in harm's way?\\"\\" - Jason Buchanan, Rovi, The New York Times. \\"Rhode Island filmmaker Mary Healey-Conlon‚Äôs documentary gives the victims of the Catholic Church a collective voice. It‚Äôs chilling to hear grown men and women describe their sexual abuse at the hands of trusted priests while seeing footage of those very priests flash across the screen. It‚Äôs shocking to hear, from the mouth of a perpetrator priest, about the 'homoerotic' church-run treatment centers, or about how boys over the age of 14 were considered 'fair game as long as you didn‚Äôt get caught.' And it‚Äôs distressing to hear, through Healey- Conlon‚Äôs personal narrative, how Church leadership opted for administrative solutions (the 'geographical cure'). In just under an hour, Healey-Conlon offers a crash course in the historical, legal, religious, and cultural aspects of the Church‚Äôs scandal. But the film never feels superficial. We are, as one survivor says, 'learning about what we don‚Äôt want to learn about,' and through that process, gaining a necessary 'knowledge of evil.'\\" - Deirdre Fulton, The Boston Phoenix, 2005.

Background  The British Empire captured Baghdad from the Ottoman Empire on 11 March 1917. British General Frederick Stanley Maude felt that the presence of 10,000 Ottoman troops north of the city, led by Khalil Pasha, and the presence of another 15,000 Ottomans under Ali Ihsan Bey posed a considerable threat to the British position in the region. Intelligence obtained by the British indicated that the Ottomans were preparing a new army group to retake Mesopotamia. General Maude launched the Samarrah Offensive to push the Ottomans away from Baghdad. Maude dispatched four columns under the command of Major General H. D'Urban Keary. The immediate objective for the force was the village of Baquba. After an initial reverse, the British secured the village from the Ottomans on 17 March 1917. During their offensive, the British believed there was a simultaneous offensive being undertaken by Russian forces under Lieutenant General Nikolai Nikolaevich Baratov to attack Turkish General Ishan. The British were unaware this Russian force had been rendered ineffective by desertion and lack of supply caused by the Russian Revolution. Ali Ishan commanded the Corps facing the Russians on the Diyala river. Ishan's 2nd Division held the ground against the Russians while his 6th Division crossed back into Mesopotamia from Persia. Maude could not allow this maneuverer to occur unhampered, and decided to force Ishan to fight causing two Ottoman rearguard actions, one being the battle of Mount Hamrin.  Prelude   Ottoman Preparations  Keary's advance up the Diyala was delayed by Ottoman rearguard units, as such Ali Ishan used this delay to heavily fortify his position at Mount Hamrin, a long and relatively low ridge stretching from near the river to just north of Baiji. Before the battle the Ottomans dug three lines of trenches overlooking two canals at the foot of the mountain.  British Plan of Attack  The British force, two Indian Raj Divisions, referred to as the \\"Khanaqin column\\", contained the 8th and 9th Indian Brigades. Keary decided to use his 8th Indian Brigade to directly assault the Ottoman position while the 9th Brigade flanked around to the east. This strategy depended on surprise, an element which was lost when the Ottoman Forces detected British forces building a bridge. British air reconnaissance detected the Ottomans moving forces to reinforce their east flank but Keary decided to proceed regardless. The battle opened shortly after dawn on 25 March 1917. The 9th Indian Brigade did not flank far enough east and attacked the Ottoman position where it had been reinforced instead of circling around the Ottoman trenches. The 9th brigade suffered significant losses and was only able to withdraw once the 8th Brigade launched an assault on the center of the Ottoman trenches. At the end of the day, Keary broke off the engagement to prevent further casualties.  Aftermath  Ishan used this Ottoman victory to withdraw across the Diyala river in an effort to link with the Sixth army. Keary continued towards the Russians, believing that the Russian force was combat effective. Contact between the forces was made on April First. Keary learned the Russians were not an effective force. As no Ottoman threat existed east of the Diyala or in Persia, Keary rejoined the main British Army under Maude. Although the British lost the battle of Mount Hamrin, it marked the last time the Ottomans attempted to invade Persia to threaten British India.

She is the creator of the Lady Henrietta Gilmour Photographic Collection of 1500 prints and 145 lantern slides held by the University of St Andrews. Life Gilmour was born in 1852 in Quebec, Canada, the second daughter of David Gilmour (died 1857) the youngest son of Allan Gilmour of Allan Gilmour & Company, a major shipping company with important Canadian connections. During a visit of her first cousin, John Gilmour (later Sir John Gilmour), she fell in love. They married in 1873 and she returned to Scotland with him to live at Montrave House in central Fife, several miles south of Cupar. At marriage he had estates at both Lundin and Montrave. He later acquired Greenside, Pratis and Kilmux, all nearby in Fife. Her husband had a strong love of curling and this wore off on her, she soon became an accomplished curler. She is one of the first female curlers to be photographed on ice (1895). In 1885 she and her husband founded the Lundin and Montrave Curling Club, and built their own curling pond on their estate, just east of the main house (this was quite fashionable in this period). Unusually, and probably due to her own influence, the club admitted both male and female members. Her own active participation appears to have begun after the birth of her last child in 1889. Around the same time she took up photography and is the first identified female photographer in Scotland. Her photographic collection, largely of Scottish society, their estate and livestock, and sporting life, was donated by her grandson to the University of St Andrews in 1978. A further 600 negatives were given to the National Museum of Scotland and are held by the Scottish Life Archive. The collection give a personal insight into society life in late 19th century Scotland. When her husband received a baronetcy from Queen Victoria in June 1897 she became Lady Henrietta Gilmour.

Landsberg (February 9, 1915 ‚Äì October 6, 2013) was an Brooklyn-born modernist architect who designed dozens of homes, synagogues, and commercial buildings in the New York metropolitan area in the 50s and 60s. Landsberg studied at the Harvard Graduate School of Design under Marcel Breuer and Walter Gropius. He worked for both after graduation.  Life and career  Born in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, in 1915, William W. Landsberg graduated from Carnegie-Mellon University in 1936 with a Bachelor of Architecture degree. He then attended the Harvard Graduate School of Design to study Modern architecture from masters Walter Gropius and Marcel Breuer. He graduated in 1938, and from 1939-1940, worked as a draftsman in the firm of Gropius & Breuer. Landsberg married Muriel Ginsberg in 1941 and, serving as an Army architect, was deployed to St. Johns, Newfoundland, where he lived for two years, designing and supervising the building of military air bases for WWII Allies.http://www.antonnews.com/portwashingtonnews/obits- archive/18669-obituary-muriel-landsberg.html Obituary: Muriel Landsberg Landsberg later served with the 1253rd Combat Engineers Battalion of the 9th Army and participated in the crossing of the Rhine in March 1945. In 1948 on the streets of Manhattan, Landsberg ran into former teacher and employer Breuer, who asked Landsberg to leave his current position at Skidmore, Owings & Merrill and join Breuer‚Äôs newly created firm. As Director of Design, Landsberg and Breuer worked closely together on a number of projects, including the exhibition house for the House in the Garden series at the Museum of Modern Art. As Breuer‚Äôs most trusted associate, Landsberg would create proper architectural drawings from Breuer's illustrations and ideas. Landsberg would also write correspondence on behalf of Breuer, as according to Landsberg, ‚Äúhis command of English was not so good‚Äù.Caroline Rob Zaleski, Long Island Modernism (New York: W. W. Norton & Company, Inc. 2012): Pg. 86 Landsberg worked with Breuer on several commercial and residential commissions in the Long Island, NY area including Hanson House in Lloyd Harbor, the Witalis House in Kings Point, and the O.E. McIntyre Plant in Westbury, NY. Landsberg left Breuer‚Äôs employment in 1956.Caroline Rob Zaleski, Long Island Modernism (New York: W. W. Norton & Company, Inc. 2012): Pg. 90 William Landsberg started his own design firm in Port Washington, NY, in 1956 where he would design homes, synagogues, and commercial buildings and continue his working relationship with Breuer. In 1957, Landsberg designed a house for Randall and Helen McIntyre in Deer Park, NY which was awarded Architectural Record's House-of-the-Year award and was featured in the magazine. In the early 60s and beyond, Landsberg worked as Project Architect for many large New York firms, including Kahn & Jacobs HOK and Edward Durell Stone. He also spent time creating his own artwork, and became very active in community affairs such as the North Shore Community Arts Center and the Manhasset Art Association. Landsberg also served as a local Building Inspector and Board Member of Zoning Appeals. He also presided as President of the local chapter of American Field Services.  William Landsberg House  William Landsberg House Landsberg moved to Port Washington, NY, designing and building a house for his family in 1951. Featured in international books, journals, magazines, newspapers, and museum exhibits, this house was the most recognized of his independent projects. The house was occupied by Landsberg and his family until his death in 2013 and is still extant.Wayne, Kenneth. Long Island Moderns: Art and Architecture on the North Shore and Beyond. New York: Heckscher Museum, 2009. pg. 76 The William Landsberg House is situated in a residential area on the north shore of Long Island, built on a hill in a wooded area. The rectangular house with a flat roof features vertical cypress panels which cover the garage and second story, which cantilevers over the first story by 3 feet on the north and south sides. Custom-sized large windows, a few of which are floor to ceiling, ornament the facades creating an open feeling in the living and dining room. The Landsberg house is considered a significant example of Bauhaus style Modern Architecture created in the United States, and as such was added to the National Register of Historic Places on August 18, 2014.

It has been recorded in Marus National Park and Lambu Sango National Reserve. Taxonomy and etymology It was described as a new species in 1940 by mammalogist H. Harold Shamel. The holotype had been collected in 1918 by H. C. Raven. Its species name \\"pelingensis\\" is Latin for \\"belonging to Peling.\\" Shamel was using an incorrect alternate spelling of the island of Peleng, which is where the holotype was collected. The Principle of Priority, which is a rule of nomenclature, means that Shamel's species name will be retained as he wrote it, though the common name can change to reflect the accurate spelling. At times in the past, it has been considered a subspecies of the fierce roundleaf bat, Hipposideros dinops. Habitat and ecology This bat roosts in karsts and caves in large groups ranging from hundreds to thousands of individuals. Conservation The IUCN lists the Peleng leaf-nosed bat as near threatened. It meets the criteria for this assessment because it is facing significant threats that may cause severe population declines in the near future. It almost qualifies for the more-threatened classification of vulnerable. Limestone extraction from cement companies contributes to the decline of available homes to these bats.

It includes an assortment of rare singles, outtakes, and previously unreleased material spanning from when the group went under the moniker, the Raggamuffins, in 1965, to their disbandment in 1969. The Raggamuffins were a folk rock trio led by Sean Bonniwell, and the prototype group that developed an experimental hard-edge sound, before recruiting two additional members and becoming the Music Machine. By 1969, all the original members, except Bonniwell, departed the group, which was then known as the Bonniwell Music Machine. Though the band would no longer produce hits, such as \\"Talk Talk\\" and \\"The People In Me\\", it was Bonniwell's most ambitious recording period as he incorporated elements of psychedelia and pop rock into the group's music. The four songs \\"Two Much\\", \\"Push Don't Pull\\", \\"Talk Me Down\\", and \\"Chances\\", were all composed and recorded in 1965, when the group was known as the Raggamuffins, and were previously unreleased. They featured a mixture of the band's folk rock roots and the protopunk better assimilated with the Music Machine. Among other songs was \\"Black Snow\\", which later appeared on Bonniwell's solo album, Close in 1969, and \\"Smoke & Water\\", a rehearsal song that was demoed. In addition, the commercially unsuccessful single \\"Advice and Consent\\", the outtake \\"Dark White\\", and \\"Citizen Fear\\" were some of the latest recordings by The Music Machine before their disbandment.

With her husband, Joseph Alex Napoleon DeGree, a United States Navy veteran of World War II, DeGree came to Monroe in 1949 so that he could take a position in the paper mill industry. She or her husband had also lived in Vermont in their younger years, locations not available. After numerous years as a housewife, DeGree obtained employment as a secretary and thereafter as a bookkeeper, receptionist, and assistant to a dentist. In the 1970s, she convinced a bank to lend her money in her own name to start a real estate business in which she worked initially nearly round the clock. Career With burgeoning financial success, DeGree in 1984 contacted the ULM, then known as Northeast Louisiana University, to donate three hundred apartments through her charitable trust. She was also a donor in the development of the Louisiana Delta Community College in Monroe. For three decades, she was aligned with St. Francis Regional Medical Center in Monroe to improve regional health care. The ULM School of Nursing and the Breast Health Center at St. Francis Hospital are named in her honor, the former at the personal request of the university president, Nick Bruno. So is the Kitty DeGree Speech and Hearing Center at ULM. There is the Kitty DeGree Foundation Lifetime Achievement Award in Business.\\"Monroe chamber seeks Kitty DeGree award nominations\\", December 29, 2017 Along with the civic activist Sandy Rosenthal of New Orleans, DeGree was inducted in 2008 into the Louisiana Center for Women and Government Hall of Fame at Nicholls State University in Thibodaux. DeGree also dedicated much time and money to veterans causes. She pushed for the establishment of the Veterans Administration Clinic and the War Veteran's Home in Monroe. She personally funded the memorial monument commemorating Selman Field at the Monroe Regional Airport. An exhibit at the Chennault Aviation and Military Museum in Monroe is dedicated to DeGree, who herself served in the United States Coast Guard from 1942-1945 during the World War II era, achieving the rank of Yeoman First Class.Scott, Griffin and Sliger, Amy. \\"Kitty DeGree\\", Legendary Locals of Monroe Louisiana, Charleston, South Carolina, Arcadia Publishing, 2014, page 33.

Her services were held on November 2, 2012, at the ULM Kitty DeGree School of Nursing in the St. Francis Medical Center Auditorium. She is interred at Hasley Cemetery in West Monroe. Shortly before her passing, The Monroe News-Star published an article, \\"Kitty DeGree: Community Treasure\\", in which the philanthropist, who gave $4 million over thirteen years through the Kitty DeGree Foundation, is quoted recalling her New England upbringing: > I grew up with a mother who always believed in helping others.

It was his first play produced on Broadway and resulted in Ardrey being awarded a Guggenheim fellowship. Story Brooks Atkinson, writing for The New York Times, gave this description of the play: > Somewhere in the northwest side of Chicago in the Polish district live the > Dzieszienewskis, the mother being an immigrant, the children being > assimilated Americans and ambitious. She is an unprincipled strumpet whose > blood boils in the Spring. Taking America as they have learned it from > notorious Americans, her children are versatile nincompoops. One son is a > melancholy baseball player in the Texas League, another is studying to be a > cheap politician, a third is president of the Killers Club in the State > penitentiary, and the daughter is a chorus girl who dreams of > Hollywood.Atkinson, Brooks. \\"'Star Spangled,' a Comedy of Polish-Americans > Who Have Not Grasped the Spirit of Our Land.\\" The New York Times, 11 March > 1936. Print. The plot of the play revolves around the imprisoned son, who has escaped for a weekend in order to see his family, and incidentally, to kill the Polish politician who set him up eight years earlier. He plans on returning to prison before he is known to be missing. Writing & Production Ardrey originally conceived of the play while \\"pushing through snowdrifts one long hard winter on a door-to-door survey in West Side slums.\\" He wrote that his experience of the turmoil of the Great Depression \\"had been anything but unique. For me, the creative consequence was the conviction that the Polish-American characters of my first play were far more amusing and meaningful than the personnel of a normal theatrical penthouse.\\" The artistic concern with portraying folk voices would be a consistent theme throughout Ardrey's career, including in his most famous play, Thunder Rock.See, for example, Ardrey's 1938 essay in the New York Times, where he gives this description of his practice: \\"I am a playwright. More than that, I am a peddler of Americans. I pick up my stock where Americans are: on a levee at Vicksburg, at a mill in St. Paul, on a sulphur dock at Galveston, around a general store in Illinois. There I gather my harvest, their lives, affections, problems, ideals. I stagger back to Chicago, which is my factory. Here I make plays. Soon a dockhand is firing a locomotive, and a farmer from Ohio has gone to work in an Indiana cement mill.\\" Ardrey, Robert. \\"Introduction to America: Writer of Plays Reports Briefly His Various Sources.\\" New York Times, 27 February 1938. Print. Ardrey originally called the play House on Fire, but changed the title on the suggestion of Arthur Hopkins. He spent significant time revising his first draft with input from Jed Harris, Ben Hecht, Charles MacArthur, and George Abbott. Abbott originally bought the option on the play in the summer of 1935, but let the option lapse. It was then bought by Hopkins, who produced the original Broadway staging. Following a preview in New Haven, Star Spangled was produced on Broadway in 1936. The settings were by Raymond Sovey; it was staged and produced by Arthur Hopkins and played at the John Golden Theatre. The cast included Natasha Boleslavsky, George Tobias, Millard Mitchell, Garson Kanin, Marjorie Lytell, Ivan Triesault, Michael Visaroff, Donald Arbury, and Edward Craven. Reception Star Spangled received mostly lukewarm reviews, but Ardrey's sense of humor was widely praised. The original New York Times review opened, \\"If humorous implications were enough, 'Star Spangled' ... would be the comedy of the season. ... [Ardrey's] sense of the ridiculous is unhackneyed and keen,\\" and went on to say, \\"Mr. Hopkins [has not] done much building on the script. But it is easy to share his enthusiasm for the quality of Mr. Ardrey's sense of humor.\\" The Brooklyn Daily Eagle called it a \\"Strange and oddly comical play‚Äîthe kind of play that gets remembered,\\" while the New York Evening Journal applauded its \\"humorous gusto and relish,\\" calling it \\"Vastly amusing.\\"Quoted in \\"Star Spangled: Publicity Notes\\" in Ardrey, Robert. Star Spangled. Toronto: Samuel French. P. 102. 1937. Print. Ardrey's humor was also praised after the preview in New Haven: \\"Walter Prichard Eaton, head of the play-writing classes at the Yale school, said after tonight's play that it tapped a rich vein of stage humor hitherto not drawn upon. ... He complimented the young author.\\"\\"New Haven Premiere for 'Star Spangled.'\\" The New York Times, 6 March 1936. Print. Despite being neither a popular nor critical success, the play won Ardrey attention from several major figures who would end up being influential in his career. In particular George Abbott, Sidney Howard, and Arthur Hopkins became interested in Ardrey, and, together with Thornton Wilder, Ardrey's writing mentor, all saw promise in the play. Due to their interventions, in particular the intervention of Howard, Ardrey was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in recognition of the play. The fellowship allowed him the financial freedom to write his next two plays, Casey Jones and How to Get Tough About It, both of which opened in 1938.\\"Getting Tough About It.\\" New York Times, 6 February 1938.

He is remembered in literary history as the founder of FlacƒÉra review, which he published in two editions, alongside Petre Locusteanu, Ion Pillat, Adrian Maniu, and, later, VintilƒÉ Russu-»òirianu. A best-selling magazine for its time, it functioned as a launching pad for several writers of the Romanian Symbolist movement. Banu was an affiliate and orator of the National Liberal Party, which he served continuously for 30 years, as a political journalist, public polemicist, and member of Parliament. His contribution as an essayist, lampoonist, and aphorist reflected his progressive approach to labor and productive life, his critique of conservatism, as well as his concept of civilized political mores. Banu's career in politics reached the international level during World War I, when he took refuge from German-occupied Romania to campaign for the Romanian cause in Paris. Subsequently, during his term as minister, he focused on negotiating a Romanian Concordat and normalizing relations with the Catholic Church. In his final years in politics, he was an affiliate of the National Liberal Party- BrƒÉtianu. These activities, like much of his vast (but fragmentary) work in print, or his speeches, endured as the focus of political controversy. Biography Early years and political debut Born in Bucharest, his father was a Gheorghe N. Banu, and his mother a Smaranda (or Coralia) Banu. He was French on his mother's side,Iorga (1967), p. 380; Stavinschi, p. 18 but his exact lineage is unclear. According to Banu himself, his French grandmother led a mysterious life in Bucharest and died at A»ôezƒÉmintele Br√¢ncovene»ôti Hospital in September 1848. Her husband was a Greek-Romanian known as Koronidy, who may have been a shipbuilder or a schoolteacher from a shipbuilding family.Stavinschi, p. 18 On his father's side, Banu was probably descending from a clan of Romanian shepherds.Iorga (1967), p. 380 His grandfather or great-grandfather was reportedly a Staroste of the furriers' guild in Gala»õi. Baptized Romanian Orthodox,Rusu Abrudeanu (1930), p. 557 Banu completed secondary education at Saint Sava National College, a classmate of writer Ioan A. Bassarabescu, actor Ion Livescu, and lawyer-politician Scarlat OrƒÉscu. Influenced by their teacher, classical scholar Anghel Demetriescu, they formed their own literary club, which held its meetings in the Saint Sava basement, putting out the polygraphed magazine Armonia, then the bi-monthly Studentul Rom√¢n.Ion Livescu, Amintiri »ôi scrieri despre teatru, pp. 7, 299‚Äì300. Bucharest: Editura pentru literaturƒÉ, 1967 Banu was also in a mathematics class taught by »òtefan Popescu. By his own recollection, he was a struggling student, and had much trouble learning trigonometry from the textbook of Spiru Haret‚Äîhis future political mentor and employer.Banu, pp. 169‚Äì171 Banu graduated from the literature and philosophy faculty of the University of Bucharest in 1895, and from the law faculty in 1900. ¬´Rotonda 13: Constantin Banu ≈üi Revista FlacƒÉra¬ª, la MNLR, Agen»õia de Carte As he himself noted in 1936: \\"Although not a literary professional, I always had a soft spot for literature.\\"Mihail »òerban, \\"Cu d. Const. Banu, evoc√¢nd trecutul. DupƒÉ 25 de ani dela apari»õia revistei FlacƒÉra, fostul ei director ne vorbe»ôte despre √Ænceputuri, colaboratori »ôi drumul parcurs\\", in AdevƒÉrul, June 27, 1928, p. 3 He also had an enduring passion for history, as noted by his professor Nicolae Iorga, who recommended him for a teacher's chair. During a stint as a novice teacher in BrƒÉila, he had his \\"second encounter\\" with Haret, who, as Education Minister, was personally inspecting the local schools. He equated listening to Haret's speech as a personal revelation about the sheer force of one's creative energies.Banu, pp. 171‚Äì175 Returning to Bucharest, Banu began working as a history professor at Matei Basarab High School in 1898, part of a teaching staff which came to include Dimitrie D. PƒÉtrƒÉ»ôcanu, Emanoil Grigorovitza, Theodor Speran»õia, Alexandru Toma, and Eugen Lovinescu.Popescu-Cadem, p. 260 One of his students was the poet George Top√Ærceanu. Banu later transferred to the Nifon Mitropolitul Seminary. In this environment, he founded a literary-and-theatrical society, with contributions from pupil Petre Locusteanu, who later became his friend and close associate. His debut in letters came in 1900, with a brochure criticizing the textbook author Serafim Ionescu and the teaching of Romanian history.Stavinschi, p. 19 At the time, Banu also took up work as a promoter of public literacy, joining Ioan Kalinderu and Barbu »òtirbey's Steaua Association, which had as its object \\"the strengthening of education among regular folk through moral, patriotic and useful publications\\".\\"¬´Steaua¬ª\\", in Albina.

Teodorescu, died. Attending his funeral, Banu gave a rousing speech exhorting the values of work ethic.Petre Hane»ô, \\"Figuri de dascƒÉli. II: Teodorescu. Gh. Dem.\\", in PreocupƒÉri Literare, Nr. 1/1942, p. 42 His political articles that appeared in Secolul XX starting in 1899, as well as his oratorical talent, drew the attention of Haret's own National Liberal Party (PNL). Around 1903, he was a functionary in the upper echelons of Education Ministry, Chief Inspector of the Private Schools under Minister Haret,Popescu- Cadem, p. 170; Stavinschi, p. 18 in which capacity he first met and encouraged the novelist (and aspiring politician) Mihail Sadoveanu. Ion Simu»õ, \\"Centenarul debutului sadovenian\\", in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 41/2004 Upon moving to Bucharest, he took over a villa on Parfumului Street, where he lived with his wife Aneta (or Ioana). She came from a boyar family of Western Moldavia, and owned an estate at HƒÉlƒÉuce»ôti. Their two sons, Nicolae and Ioan, were respectively born in 1907 and 1908. As noted by memoirist Constantin Kiri»õescu, Banu quit the education system when his job became \\"a nuisance, a hindrance to his rise.\\"Stavinschi, p. 21 Working for the liberal press, he was editor-in-chief of Voin»õa Na»õionalƒÉ from 1903 and director of Viitorul from 1907, part of a team that also comprised future PNL leader Ion G. Duca and scholar Henric Streitman.S. Podoleanu, 60 scriitori rom√¢ni de originƒÉ evreeascƒÉ, Vol. II, p. 311. Bucharest: Bibliografia, Bucharest, [1935]. At Voin»õa Na»õionalƒÉ, Banu inaugurated a literary supplement, which put out feuilletons by Sadoveanu, Ioan Alexandru BrƒÉtescu-Voine»ôti, Ilarie Chendi, Nicolae Gane, and Ion Bentoiu. Under his auspices, Voin»õa Na»õionalƒÉ also featured commentary on literature, theater and painting. Under the pen name Teofil, he wrote the column Una-alta (\\"This and That\\") in a literary style, focusing on politics, but also outlining his belief in the didactic value of art. It was also at this paper that he resumed his close collaboration with Locusteanu. FlacƒÉra creation Meanwhile, Banu's radical politics collided with the agenda of the Conservative Party and its Prime Minister, Gheorghe Grigore Cantacuzino. During the peasants' revolt of early 1907, Iorga and Banu's Bucharest homes were searched by police, who confiscated \\"a great number of letters and important papers.\\"\\"Ultima orƒÉ. Nuoi perchezi»õiunƒ≠\\", in Opinia, April 8, 1907, p. 3 The riots were repressed with much violence; in the aftermath, Banu asked his students at Nifon Mitropolitul to submit anonymous essays on the \\"peasant question and the recently quelled peasant uprising.\\" This investigation showed that these rural students generally detested the upper class of \\"boyars\\" for their \\"enormous wealth\\", which they saw as exploiting the sharecropper's toil.Mihail E. Ionescu, \\"'Lec»õii √ÆnvƒÉ»õate' din 1907\\", in Magazin Istoric, April 2007, pp. 19‚Äì20 In his late years, Banu still recalled the impression left on him by the revolt, \\"this free-riding daughter of Nature\\": \\"I have seen pillars of fire roaming the villages, setting train stations alight, and crackling among the ruins.\\" In the election of May, running on PNL lists in Ialomi»õa County,Stavinschi, p. 20 Banu took a seat in the Assembly of Deputies. He was its Secretary from 1907 to 1911.CƒÉlinescu, p. 720; Stavinschi, p. 20 Banu impressed his audience, including the Conservative adversary Alexandru Marghiloman, with his oratorical skill.Stavinschi, pp. 19, 20 In 1910, he was among the jurors who condemned to prison Gheorghe Stoenescu-Jelea, the would-be assassin of Prime Minister Ion I. C. BrƒÉtianu.Constantin Bacalba»ôa, Bucure»ôtii de altƒÉ datƒÉ, Vol. III, p. 256. Bucharest: Universul, 1936 Upon the Conservatives' return to power, he failed to win a seat in the 2nd College Ilfov County in the February 1911 election, running on a coalition anti-Conservative list headed by Nicolae Fleva.Constantin Bacalba»ôa, Bucure»ôtii de altƒÉ datƒÉ, Vol. IV, pp. 12‚Äì14. Bucharest: Universul, 1936 On October 22, 1911,Baiculescu et al., p. 245; CƒÉlinescu, p. 713; Desa et al., p. 348; Stavinschi, p. 19 Banu and Locusteanu printed the first issue of FlacƒÉra, a weekly literature and current events magazine. When asked what motivated him to launch his own magazine, Banu referred to his literary passion, and also noted that the magazine (or \\"literary newspaper\\") was \\"of some use to my [liberal] party\\"‚Äî\\"Duca understood this from the very start, and so he was happy to inaugurate the magazine with an article of his own\\". The name, literally \\"Flame\\", was chosen in oblique reference to the \\"pillars of fire\\" of 1907. These, Banu argued, could be turned into constructive fires of \\"purification\\". With its \\"people's agenda\\",Cernat, p. 54 FlacƒÉra had a regular circulation of 15,000, peaking at 30,000,Boia, pp. 96‚Äì97; Peltz, p. 116 which was unusually high for the demographic and literacy standards of the Kingdom of Romania. This was largely because of Locusteanu's contribution in publicity,Boia, pp. 96‚Äì976 but also, according to Banu, to the talents featured in its pages. Also according to Banu, the magazine owed its survival to Locusteanu and, secondly, to Spiru Hasna»ô. It had unparalleled success among the urban middle classes, particularly with its exposure of literary scandals.CƒÉlinescu, p. 713 One such series described in detail the suicide attempt, agony, and death of a poet, Dimitrie Anghel. Anghel's estranged wife, Natalia Negru, was enraged by the coverage, and speculated that Anghel had been left to die in order to benefit Banu's circulation. She also contended that Banu and Duca together ran a \\"liberal mafia\\".Natalia Negru, Petre »öurlea, \\"Reverbera»õii. √éncƒÉ o datƒÉ despre 'triunghiul de dragoste »ôi moarte'\\", in Magazin Istoric, August 2001, pp. 53‚Äì54 FlacƒÉra was also disliked by professional critics. Reviled for its alleged eclecticism and lack of aesthetic discernment, the magazine became involved in polemics, mainly written by Banu, who also personally interviewed his featured writers. The magazine set out as a mainstream review, hosting established talents such as Ion Luca Caragiale and Barbu »òtefƒÉnescu Delavrancea; its most nonconformist contributors were \\"moderate\\" Romanian Symbolists: Ion Minulescu, Caton Theodorian, and Victor Eftimiu, later joined by Barbu Nem»õeanu,Cernat, pp. 107‚Äì108 and sometimes by Nicolae Budurescu, Alexandru Dominic, and Eugen Titeanu.Peltz, pp. 102, 190, 204 Most of Banu's own writings appeared in FlacƒÉra; these included poems, aphorisms and literary, cultural and political articles. He also signed his work as Glaucon and Mefisto, and sometimes used Al. »òerban, Const. Paul and Cronicarul D√¢mbovi»õei, pen names he shared with Locusteanu. His journalistic work, also carried in George Diamandy's Revista Democra»õiei Rom√¢ne,Baiculescu et al., p. 532 sought to express political objectivity and sincerity. Some of his socially themed texts, conceived as sketches or little scenes, denounced parasitism, lack of patriotism, arrogance and aggressive stupidity; his ideology veered toward producerism. According to literary historian George CƒÉlinescu, such works are without stylistic value: \\"C. Banu shows up in his aphorisms as a grieving but trite Guicciardini, of no humanistic worth\\". At the time of their publishing, Banu's texts were derided by a rival modernist, Tudor Arghezi, who, by one estimate, wrote half of his lampoons entirely against Banu or FlacƒÉra. In Arghezi's magazine Facla, Banu and Locusteanu were viewed as \\"triumphant mediocrities\\" and \\"street organs\\", on the same artistic level as Radu D. Rosetti and Maica Smara.Remus ZƒÉstroiu, \\"Elemente de criticƒÉ literarƒÉ √Æn periodicele socialiste dintre 1900 »ôi 1916\\", in Anuar de LingvisticƒÉ »ôi Istorie LiterarƒÉ, Vol. 18, 1967, p. 143 Nevertheless, with Ion Pillat and Adrian Maniu as caretakers of the literary pages, FlacƒÉra also turned to more radical forms of modernism.CƒÉlinescu, p. 713; Cernat, pp. 23, 32, 54, 61, 188 Pillat, Maniu, and Horia FurtunƒÉ also \\"conspired\\" to relaunch here the disgraced Symbolist mentor, Alexandru Macedonski, serializing his novel Thalassa; and helped launch the career of George Bacovia, publishing his plaquette Plumb.Tudor Vianu, Scriitori rom√¢ni, Vol. III, Editura Minerva, Bucharest, 1971, pp. 353, 383. Symbolist N. Davidescu took over as the literary reviewer, pushing an aesthetic ideal that was inspired by readings from Remy de Gourmont;Cernat, p. 61 the other staff reviewer was Hasna»ô who, CƒÉlinescu notes, merely wrote \\"earnestly\\". The magazine also published illustration by, among others, the debuting avant-garde draftsman, Marcel Janco.Cernat, p. 188 World War I In the years before World War I, returned to the Assembly, Banu debated major national issues with the Conservative Party doctrinaires. Responding to Constantin C. Arion's call for national unity after the Balkan Wars, he argued that such internal peace could never be achieved with \\"an aggrieved peasantry as the basis of our State\\". A land reform, he contended, could even make Romania into a great regional power.Sebastian-Drago»ô Bunghez, \\"Parlamentul »ôi politica externƒÉ a Rom√¢niei √Æn ajunul Primului RƒÉzboi Mondial (februarie-iunie 1914)\\", in CercetƒÉri Istorice, Vol. 33, 2014, pp. 197‚Äì198 Nevertheless, Banu was also critical of the populist currents undermining the PNL, and thus picked sides against Iorga and his Democratic Nationalists. His FlacƒÉra articles, Iorga noted at the time, supported anti-nationalist causes such as Jewish emancipation,Nicolae Iorga, Ac»õiunea militarƒÉ a Rom√¢niei. √én Bulgaria cu osta»ôii no»ôtri, p. 19. Bucharest: Editura Socec, 1914 while his parliamentary speeches expressed worries against the rise of Romania's insurrectionist \\"Boulangisme\\".Nicolae Iorga, Oameni cari au fost, Vol. II, p. 332. Bucharest: Editura Funda»õiilor Regale, 1935 Banu hoped to appease Conservatives who viewed land reform as proof of socialism, contending that \\"increasing property\\" was the best method to curb left-wing agitation and promote \\"social conservation\\". He also campaigned for election reform, insisting that it could solve the \\"periodic convulsions\\" in Romanian society, and criticizing the Conservatives' electoral ideal as a Potemkin village.Nicolae Copoiu, \\"...acest vulcan care fierbe surd\\", in Magazin Istoric, September 1973, pp. 11‚Äì12 Plaque honoring the 1917‚Äì1918 National Committee for Romanian Unity, at the former H√¥tel des deux mondes, Avenue de l'Op√©ra, Paris. Banu credited as one of three La Roumanie editors By 1914, Banu was also writing for the FlacƒÉra satellite Semnalul, for the PNL paper Democra»õia, and for the literary bimonthly VƒÉpaia.Baiculescu et al., pp. 178, 613, 694 In July, days after the Sarajevo assassination, Banu was selected on a panel of deputies, headed by Mihail G. Orleanu, which proposed democratic reforms to the 1866 constitution. Other members included Iorga, Constantin Stere, Nicolae Romanescu, and VintilƒÉ BrƒÉtianu.\\"Comisiunile de studii ale Constituantei\\", in Gazeta IlustratƒÉ, Nr. 30/1914, p. 4 Romania kept neutral during the first two years of war, but an intellectual battle divided Romanian society, between \\"Francophiles\\", who supported the Entente, and \\"Germanophiles\\", who looked to the Central Powers. Banu and the National Liberals leaned toward the Entente Francophiles. In October 1914, he directed a rally of university students who vandalized the offices of Ziua, a Germanophile daily put out by Ioan Slavici, and chanted threats against Grigore Gheorghe Cantacuzino, owner of the Germanophile Seara.Carmen Patricia Reneti, \\"Rela»õii rom√¢no-germane √Æn anul 1914\\", in Revista de Istorie MilitarƒÉ, Nr. 1‚Äì2/2010, pp. 36, 39 Although, as historian Lucian Boia writes, it remained \\"without jarring partisanship\\",Boia, p. 97 FlacƒÉras Ententist-and- populist tinges were ridiculed and parodied in Chemarea, the radical-left Symbolist review put out by Ion Vinea. Banu's 1916 book Sub mascƒÉ (\\"Under the Mask\\"), signed Mefisto, included poems initially published in FlacƒÉras Gazeta rimatƒÉ column. Their subjects received varying treatment, with tones that ranged from humor and pamphleteering jokes to invective; Banu himself acknowledged that such pieces were \\"sometimes mean and often unfair\\". As critics note, his critical virulence and moralizing intent were balanced by a certain literary talent, itself subsumed by the categorical nature of polemic. Also published that year, the brochure TrƒÉiascƒÉ via»õa!‚Ä¶ (\\"Long Live Life!‚Ä¶\\") is a collection of articles, some of them distinctly autobiographical.Stavinschi, pp. 18, 20 Honoring its secret commitment to the Entente, Romania entered the war in August 1916. FlacƒÉra closed down with a final issue on November 13 of that year,Baiculescu et al., p. 245; Desa et al., p. 348 as Bucharest prepared for the German siege. Banu later escaped to Paris, where, from January 1918, he joined the directorial staff of La Roumanie journal (with Emil Fagure and Constantin Mille), campaigning in French for the cause of Greater Romania.Desa et al., pp. 829‚Äì830; Rusu Abrudeanu (1921), pp. 442‚Äì443 He intervened directly to obtain statements of solidarity with beleaguered Romania from Ernest Lavisse, Lucien Poincar√©, and other French academics, while trying in vain to prevent the Romanian government from negotiating a separate peace with the Central Powers.Rusu Abrudeanu (1921), pp. 446‚Äì450 With the turn of tides, Banu formed part of the Romanian delegation to the Paris Peace Conference in 1919, attending as co- director of La Roumanie. He was reelected to the Assembly in November 1919, ensuring his political survival into the era of universal suffrage: although imposed on the Ialomi»õa voters by the PNL leadership, he overcame both stiff opposition by the Peasants' Party and factional disputes inside his own caucus.Vi»ôan, pp. 288‚Äì290, 294 From his position as deputy, he made overtures toward Iorga and the Democratic Nationalists in power, moderating his party's attacks against them.Iorga (1930), p. 289 In March 1920, when the anti-PNL coalition was toppled by King Ferdinand I, Iorga proposed that Banu and Matei B. Cantacuzino form a technocratic government of national reconciliation; the monarch preferred a cabinet headed by Alexandru Averescu.Iorga (1930), pp. 362‚Äì364 Banu found himself toppled by his Ialomi»õa constituents during the election of May 1920.Vi»ôan, p. 294 Banu put out two more editions of FlacƒÉra between December 10, 1921 and June 1923, with VintilƒÉ Russu-»òirianu as his second, contributions from old regulars such as Minulescu and Macedonski,Desa et al., p. 209 and food chronicles by PƒÉstorel Teodoreanu.Florina P√Ærjol, \\"Destinul unui formator de gusturi. De la savoarea 'pastilei' gastronomice la gustul fad al compromisului\\", in Transilvania, Nr. 12/2011, pp. 19, 25 Banu who wrote regularly for Cuget Rom√¢nesc monthly during that interval, had no say in FlacƒÉras management, which went to Pillat, FurtunƒÉ, and then Minulescu. Despite their \\"great efforts\\", he noted, the magazine failed commercially‚Äî\\"such were the times.\\" Ministerial office and later life Still in the Assembly following the 1922 election, Banu served as Arts and Religious Affairs Minister under Prime Minister BrƒÉtianu, from January 19, 1922 to October 30, 1923; he was also ad interim Minister of Public Works on January 19‚Äì22, 1922. During that time, he involved himself in negotiating a Concordat, in the hope of normalizing relations with the Holy See. The 1923 constitution gave special recognition to the Orthodox and Greek Catholic Church, but Banu satisfied the former when he stripped state representatives of their right to elect bishops.Iorga (1939), p. 70 According to memoirist and PNL man Ion Rusu Abrudeanu, he erred in keeping by his side the Greek Catholic functionary Zenovie P√¢cli»ôanu, who stood accused of undermining the PNL and of leaking the Concordat draft to the Catholic press in Transylvania.Rusu Abrudeanu (1930), pp. 557, 562‚Äì563, 565‚Äì568 Reportedly, P√¢cli»ôanu also sabotaged Banu's investigation into allegations of church art smuggling by Catholic clergymen who migrated to Hungary.Rusu Abrudeanu (1930), pp. 564‚Äì565 Banu's accomplishments as minister include his successful promotion of Romania's first copyright law, on January 15, 1923. Cassian Maria Spiridon, \\"Secolul breslei scriitorice»ôti\\", in Convorbiri Literare, April 2008 He also founded an Inspectorate of Romanian Museums, under Alexandru Tzigara-Samurca»ô, but withheld its financing later on.Tzigara-Samurca»ô, pp. 165‚Äì166 The two politicians negotiated for a reciprocal exchange of coveted cultural goods between, on one hand, Romania and, on the other, Weimar Germany and the Austrian Republic. They only managed to obtain the Cucuteni Treasure from Berlin.Tzigara-Samurca»ô, p. 338 By late 1923, Banu was noted for his opposition to the new PNL establishment, whose most prominent figure was VintilƒÉ BrƒÉtianu; unlike his colleagues, he did not believe in the goal of \\"crushing\\" the opposition, at the time led by the Peasants' Party.Iorga (1939), pp. 102, 106 Resigning from the Ministry in November, to be replaced by Alexandru Lapedatu,\\"Noul ministru al artelor\\", in Ilustra»õia SƒÉptƒÉm√¢nalƒÉ, Nr. 2/1923, p. 3 Banu still served in the Senate, but largely withdrew from public life. His articles and musings were being still published in AdevƒÉrul, Convorbiri Literare, and Cele Trei Cri»ôuri. In 1927, celebrating the golden jubilee of Romanian Independence with conferences at the Bucharest Atheneum, Banu outlined his liberal critique of the conservative ethos, turning against \\"reactionary\\" cultural figures such as Caragiale, Mihail Eminescu, and the Junimea circle.Cioculescu, pp. 151‚Äì154 Such themes were also explored in his lectures, recorded by Radio Romania in 1929 and 1933. As Caragiale scholar »òerban Cioculescu noted at the time, Banu's \\"effete phraseology\\" and \\"cliche vocabulary\\" encased his resentments against conservative intellectuals, who had exposed and satirized the \\"characteristics of practical liberalism\\".Cioculescu, pp. 153‚Äì154 Between 1927 and 1930, the PNL polarized into competing factions: one led by VintilƒÉ BrƒÉtianu and the other, the \\"Georgists\\", by Gheorghe BrƒÉtianu. Banu was on the side of the former, and also expressed his faction's sympathy for King Carol II, who had returned from exile to reclaim his throne.Ioan Lupa»ô, \\"√éntre ¬´Vintili»ôti¬ª »ôi ¬´Gheorghi»ôti¬ª\\", in »öara NoastrƒÉ, Nr. 10/1930, p. 945 By December 1933, with VintilƒÉ dead and Duca, his one-time colleague at Viitorul, in charge of the party, Banu had embraced Georgism and defected to the PNL's seceded wing, the \\"National Liberal Party-BrƒÉtianu\\". He and Artur VƒÉitoianu were the most notorious PNL assets to follow Gheorghe BrƒÉtianu on this venture.Vasile Netea, Memorii. T√¢rgu Mure»ô: Editura Nico, 2010, p. 204. This move was also a sign of Banu's opposition to the politically ambitious Carol II: Banu, BrƒÉtianu, and Constantin C. Giurescu were working on a proclamation against Carol, his camarilla, and Duca, the acting PNL Prime Minister. A year later, after Duca's unexpected assassination by the Iron Guard, a National Peasants' Party administration intervened to stop Banu, BrƒÉtianu, P. P. Negulescu and others from coordinating massive opposition rallies.Petre »öurlea, \\"Rom√¢nia sub stƒÉp√¢nirea Camarilei Regale (1930‚Äì1940) (III)\\", in Analele UniversitƒÉ»õii Cre»ôtine Dimitrie Cantemir. Seria Istorie, Vol. 2, Issues 1‚Äì2, pp. 172‚Äì173, 190‚Äì191 The Iron Guard also took notice, and Banu's name appeared on an enemies' list, alongside those of Aristide Blank, Alexandru C. Constantinescu, Wilhelm Filderman, and Gheorghe Gh. M√¢rzescu. According to Kiri»õescu, Banu reached the \\"forefront of politics\\", but failed to preserve his position‚Äîoverall, he lacked \\"the faculty which allows one to wiggle through, to engage in transactions\\". Banu's final book appeared in 1937 as GrƒÉdina lui Glaucon sau Manualul bunului politician (\\"Glaucon's Garden or A Textbook for Good Politicians\\"). Here, he uses his political and artistic experience to analyze his peers in 757 sections (aphorisms, words of advice and morality sketches). Through these, he shows his ethical leanings, irony, and skepticism, formulating concise general judgments. Banu spent his final years away from the capital, at his wife's home in HƒÉlƒÉuce»ôti. He died in 1940 at a hospital in Roman, and was buried in Plot 21 of Bellu Cemetery, Bucharest.Gheorghe G. Bezviconi, Necropola Capitalei, p. 63. Bucharest: Nicolae Iorga Institute of History, 1972 His former mentor and adversary Iorga paid homage to him with an obituary in Neamul Rom√¢nesc, emphasizing that Banu, the \\"unusual figure\\" among his peers, belonged to an older era of \\"dignity and decency, when people were held up by talent and merit\\". Banu's oratory was of \\"great formal restraint, unjarring.\\"Iorga (1967), p. 381 Aneta Gu»õulescu-Banu survived her husband for decades, dying in 1970. Their first-born Nicolae \\"Bob\\", who lived to 1985, was married to the actress Lucia, a member of the Rosetti family and niece of the composer George Enescu. Ioan, his brother, died in 2001. Constantin and Aneta's other child was a daughter, Ana-Irina \\"Nazica\\", who married the engineer Nicolae Cristofor. The villa built by the Banus' on Parfumului Street was nationalized by the communist regime, and assigned to an army institution. In 1987, at the height of the Ceau»ôima campaign, it was demolished.

It is native to Bermuda, the West Indies, Central and South America. It is nocturnal and hides in a burrow by day. Taxonomy At one time, nearly all the short-tailed crickets in the United States were considered to belong to the species Anurogryllus muticus, the range of which extended from Canada to much of South America. In a revision of the genus made by T. Walker in 1973, Anurogryllus arboreus was split off on the basis of the calling behavior of the male, and on certain morphological differences. The range of A. muticus is now considered to include Bermuda, the West Indies, Central and South America as far south as southern Brazil while that of A. arboreus covers much of the continental United States. There are two subspecies; A. muticus caraibeus (Saussure, 1874) is found in the West Indies, the type locality being Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands, and A. muticus muticus (De Geer, 1773) which is found in Central and South America, the type locality being Suriname. Description A. muticus is a small, pale brown cricket with a very short ovipositor. The adults have wings, which is in contrast to A. arboreus which sheds its wings soon after maturing. Behavior A. muticus is nocturnal, concealing itself in a burrow during the day. It forages at night and carries food into the burrow to side-chambers which it excavates. The entrance to the burrow is normally kept plugged except when its owner is outside. Its preferred food seems to be the clover Alysicarpus vaginalis and the burrow is often constructed close to this food source. This is particularly advantageous for females, which forage on this plant before egg-laying, transport time being minimised by its close proximity. Males of A. muticus call to attract a mate; the call is made during much of the night which is in contrast to A. arboreus which only calls for a period of two to three hours shortly after sunset. Much energy is expended on calling and although the cricket metabolises both carbohydrates and lipids when at rest, while calling it mostly metabolises the lipids which have been stored in the testes.

The park opened in 1887 and closed in 1964.  History  Wenona Beach Amusement Park was preceded by the O-at-ka Beach, and in 1876 by the Bay View Resort. The resort was home to a brawl between Fabian Joe Fournier, who helped inspire Paul Bunyan legends, and Blinky Robertson prior to Fournier's murder on the Water Street steamboat dock. Wenona Beach Entertainment Center, later Wenona Beach Amusement Park, was founded in 1887 by lumber barons such as Spencer O. Fisher, Henry H. Aplin, and Theodore F. Shepard. They contracted John Rabid to design the park, which featured a large pavilion that served as the park's focal point and a large pier stretching onto the Saginaw Bay. The owners, who also owned the Bay City Street Car Company, built a railway line that looped by the Kawkawlin River and took passengers from the west side of Bay City, Michigan to the park. An electric trolley, and later motor buses made regular trips to the park from the city. During the first half of the 20th century, the park was operated by the Bay City Traction and Electric Company. One of the park's early managers, J. Carpenter, was taken to court for operating a theater without a license in violation of an ordinance passed by the Bangor Township Board on June 6, 1906. By the early 1900s and 1920s, the park had become a popular destination for people living in nearby counties. In 1907, the resort drew media attention to a speedboat race between the Arrow and W.J. Oulette's Secret, which set a then world record of . By 1942, the park was owned by H. M. Smart and Otto Pierce. In March 1947, the park was damaged by a storm which swept through the Midwestern United States. The storm's winds pushed high ice piles from the Saginaw Bay onto the park's shores. The park's bath house near the shoreline was demolished by the ice. the Roller Coaster and other structures were damaged by the ice pressing against them. The park suffered from poor attendance in its later years and closed in 1964. The land has been occupied by a trailer park since 1965.  Attractions  Wenona Beach Amusement Park was described by Augustus H. Gansser in his 1905 book on the History of Bay County, Michigan as \\"the 'Coney Island' of the Lakes.\\" The park featured a casino, vaudeville performances, boating, carnival games, bath houses, docking facilities, and a boardwalk. The park also featured rides such as Circular Swings, a Joy Wheel on the shoreline, a Steam Carousel, the Roller Coaster, the Jack Rabbit (a roller coaster), the Bullet (a centrifugal force ride), Bumper cars, the Roll-O-Plane, and a ferris wheel with a view of the Saginaw Bay. A large ballroom was used for dancing and roller skating. The park, especially the casino, held regular live performances by entertainers such as Jack Benny, Perry Como, Bob Crosby, The Dorsey Brothers, Marie Dressler, W. C. Fields, Woody Herman, Isham Jones, Guy Lombardo, Ozzie and Harriet, the Marx Brothers, Red Nichols and His Five Pennies, Ted Weems. Local Harry Jarkey made regular appearances. There were a number of food concession stands, including a popular french fry stand at the north end of the park, Wright's Cafe, an ice cream parlor, and a restaurant in the casino.  Events  Many large social events, such as family reunions and corporate outings utilized Wenona Beach Amusement Park's large picnic area. The park also hosted an annual 4th of July fireworks display.  Publications  In 1988, J.R. Watson, who worked at the park when he was 12 years old, published a book about the park titled Wenona Beach. Watson soon sold all 8000 copies, and decided in 2007 to reissue the book.

She is also a co-director of the USC Dornsife Mind and Society Center. Oyserman received a PhD in psychology and social work from the University of Michigan (1987). She was on the faculty of The Hebrew University, Jerusalem before joining the University of Michigan, where she last held appointments as the Edwin J. Thomas Collegiate Professor of Social Work, Professor of Psychology, and Research Professor in the Institute for Social Research. She has been recognized by several international organizations for her contributions to psychology‚Äîshe is a Fellow of the Association for Psychological Science, the American Psychological Association, the Society for Experimental Social Psychology, and the Society for Personality and Social Psychology. Oyserman is interested in cultural differences in affect, behavior, and cognition ‚Äì how people feel, act, and think about themselves and the world around them. She also examines racial, ethnic and social class gaps in educational achievement and health (see also work relating to gender and self-concept). Across these domains of research and in different contexts, Oyserman investigates how changes in mindset can shape the perceived meaning of behaviors and situations and how these shifts can have significant effects on health and academic performance. Throughout her work, she examines how apparently ‚Äúfixed‚Äùdifferences between groups may in fact mask highly malleable situated processes that can be profoundly influenced through small interventions that shift mindset. Oyserman's research has direct implications for the classroom and goal attainment in other domains. And her work has received significant media attention for its novel theoretical and applied value. Culture and mindset In 2002,Oyserman, D., Coon, H., & Kemmelmeier, M. (2002). Rethinking individualism and collectivism: Evaluation of theoretical assumptions and meta-analyses. Psychological Bulletin, 128, 3-72. Oyserman and colleagues conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis to examine cross-country/region differences in cognitive processes. She found that differences in cognition mapped onto regional differences in collectivism and individualism. That paper alone has been cited over 3000 times in just over 10 years. In fact this paper is honored on the ISI Web of Science (\\"Hot Topic in Psychology/Psychiatric\\" in July 2002 as the fastest increasing citation impact of that year, and in 2004 \\"Top 3 Hot Papers Published in the Last Three Years for Psychology/Psychiatry\\"). A few years later,Oyserman, D., & Lee, S. W. S. (2008). Does culture influence what and how we think? Effects of priming individualism and collectivism. Psychological Bulletin, 134, 311-342. Oyserman observed that each culture benefits from independence and interdependence and that most people likely have access to both of these‚Äîessential‚Äîcognitive processes. Indeed, Oyserman found that people did not have to come from a particular culture in order to draw on an individualist or collectivist mindset. Rather, simply priming people to think from an individualist or collectivist perspective can produce effects that look just like cultural differences. For instance, getting people to circle ‚ÄúI‚Äù or ‚ÄúMine‚Äù can make ‚Äúindividualist‚Äù Americans look just like ‚Äúcollectivist‚Äù Chinese or Koreans and vice versa. Neither mindset is superior‚Äîthe extent to which they enhance (or impair) performance depends on the task at hand. Once primed, people will draw on a mindset regardless of whether it helps or hurts them to complete an ongoing task. In the context of the SAT, a shift in mindset can alter performance from 10-15%. Health and achievement Mindsets exist beyond cultural contexts too. Oyserman has investigated how another set of mindsets influence persistent engagement in goals such as health or academic achievement. She started with the observation that there is often a mismatch between children‚Äôs aspirations and their actual attainment. For instance, children generally have high aspirations for their education, but in reality, there attainment lags behind. Some groups are affected more by this mismatch in aspirations and actual attainment‚Äîboys, low income children, African American and Latino children, whose aspirations are similar to those of girls, high income children and children from other racial-ethnic backgrounds but whose attainments are more likely to lag behind. Relatively rigid societal structures contribute to this mismatch. And although interventions to address these structural issues are intensive (large‚Äêscale, long term and financially demanding) there is growing evidence that they might change children‚Äôs opportunity structures. One reason they do this is because they influence children‚Äôs perceptions of what is possible for them, and people like them, in the future. Accordingly, interventions that focus on this macro‚Äêmicro interface can help children overcome the constraints imposed by social structural variables.Oyserman, D. (2006). High power, low power, and equality: Culture beyond individualism and collectivism. Journal of Consumer Psychology, 16, 352-357. Identity-based motivation A core way to intervene with aspiration-achievement gaps in academics is to make school success part of a child‚Äôs perceived identity. Oyserman‚Äôs theory of identity‚Äêbased motivation (IBM, Oyserman, 2007, 2009)Oyserman, D. (2007). Social Identity and Self- regulation. In A.W. Kruglanski & E.T. Higgins (Eds.), Social Psychology: Handbook of Basic Principles (second edition). New York: Guilford Press.Destin & Oyserman (2009). From assets to school outcomes. Psychological Science has been used as a foundation for school interventions (and tests of those interventions) in public schools in Detroit, Chicago, and other locations in the U.S. as well as internationally in Singapore and England. The IBM model assumes that identity is multifaceted and dynamically constructed in context. People interpret situations in ways that are congruent with their currently active identity and prefer identity‚Äêcongruent actions over identity‚Äêincongruent ones. One way this plays out is that students are more likely to act on steps toward a future self goal (e.g. college) when their perceived future self feels congruent with their current self-identity. This feeling of congruence can set students on a path towards their future selves, and it can shape how they interpret experienced difficulty along the way. Two interpretations of experienced difficulty are highlighted. The first way to interpret experienced difficulty is that it reflects the importance of a task or of attaining a goal. Experienced difficulty in this case reflects that this is the path‚Äîas in the saying ‚Äúno pain, no gain.‚Äù The second way to interpret experienced difficulty is that it reflects the possibility of succeeding in a task or of attaining a goal. Experienced difficulty in this case reflects that this not likely or even impossible. The same experience of difficulty can be interpreted either way depending on the momentary cues and what activated identities seem to mean for engagement.Smith, G. C. & Oyserman, D. (2015). Just not worth my time: Experienced difficulty and time investment. Social Cognition, 33, 86-103 The elements of IBM were translated into activities for school-based intervention. This identity-goal approach has real world consequences: randomized trials show significant improvement in academic outcomes. The intervention is available for use, and the active ingredients can be used in other platforms (e.g., edugames) or as part of regular instruction techniques for teachers.

The film was released in the United States on October 2, 2015 by Scream Factory. Plot It's All Hallow's Eve. Anson (Michael Weston) enters a convenience store where he buys sorbet and flirts with the cashier, Bethany (Sarah Silverman). Nearby the employees of a Mexican Cantina & Bar, waitress Cricket (Molly Ephraim), bartender Kerry (Sutton Foster), cook Yannick (Lothaire Bluteau), busboy Hector (Gabriel Luna), manager Chuy (Paul Rodriguez), and security guard Winketta (Gabourey Sidibe) close up the Cantina and have a small party celebrating Kerry, who is leaving to become a paramedic. As the party wraps up the employees discover the doors have been welded shut and the phone lines are cut. Anson, his brother Stef (Jimmi Simpson), and Stef's girlfriend Mimi (Lily Cole) (the latter two having been at a table making out earlier) then appear and quickly take the employees hostage, tying them to chairs. Apparently uninterested in money, their true intentions soon become clear - they are sadists and cannibals, who plan to torture and eat the various employees. Stef soon chains up Yannick in the kitchen to cook the various employees as they are dispatched in different sick and sadistic games. After the trio eat Chuy, Kerry pretends to be romantically interested in Anson to gain his trust, and comes onto him while retrieving a list of items from the pantry for Yannick to cook with. However while eating Winketta's corpse Stef starts to experience anaphylactic shock, and realizes Yannick has snuck basil into his food, which he had forbid earlier as he is highly allergic. Examining the list of items he realizes that Yannick used the Army of Portugal cipher to tell Kerry to bring him basil. While Stef and Yannick start fighting each other, in the other room Hector has managed to free himself and Cricket. Anson and Hector square off upstairs while Cricket and Kerry fight Mimi. Back in the kitchen, after a long battle with both parties sustaining horrible wounds, Stef manages to kill Yannick. Mimi kills Cricket, but Kerry manages to kill her, and just as it appears Hector will kill Anson, Anson kills Hector instead. Anson and Kerry reunite and head into the kitchen, where Anson sees his brothers condition and learns from Stef that Kerry betrayed him and brought Yannick the basil (Which Kerry confirms, and further tells him her apparent romantic interest in him was a ruse). While Anson holds his brother as he succumbs to his wounds and anaphylaxis, Kerry frees Bert, a random patron who was being kept hostage in the kitchen by Mimi. Together they head upstairs to escape through an opening for an air conditioner. When Anson suddenly runs out of the kitchen attempts to attack Kerry after Stef dies, she manages to shoot him with arrow. Thinking she is safe Kerry crawls out the opening, only for a revived Anson to appear & take a bite out of her leg; however Kerry still manages to escape. Though the fall from the opening kills Bert, Kerry lives and is riding away on a Vespa when she is hit by an ambulance, whose driver happens to be someone she completed paramedic training with. As she is loaded into the ambulance, Kerry panics and notes that Anson (who had been watching from the opening) has disappeared. Several months later, we see Anson consulting with his brother (who is now a pickled head impaled on a stick) before heading into the convenience store he went to in the beginning of the movie. He visits with Bethany (the clerk) and gives her a single red rose while proposing a romance between them, which Bethany agrees to. As Bethany and Anson share ice cream & flirt, the camera pulls back to reveal Kerry across the street, scarred but alive, taking photos of them. She smiles slyly into the camera before the screen cuts to black.

He was foaled in Kentucky but sold as a yearling to race in Europe where he was trained in England by Henry Cecil. He won both his races as a two-year- old including the Autumn Stakes and emerged as a potentially top-class performer in the following spring with a win in the Newmarket Stakes. After finishing fourth in the Dante Stakes and third in the Prix Jean Prat he recorded his biggest victory when defeating Desert Prince in the St James's Palace Stakes. He went on to win the Prix Eug√®ne Adam in France but was beaten by Desert Prince in the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes. Dr Fong was sent to race in the United States but failed to reproduce his best form and did not win again. Since his retirement from racing he has stood as a breeding stallion in Britain, France and Turkey and has sired several major winners. Background Dr Fong was a chestnut horse with a white blaze and a white sock on his left hind leg bred in Kentucky by Prestonwood Farm Inc. He was sired by Kris S, who made little impact as a racehorse but sired the winners of more than 20 Group One/Grade I races, including Symboli Kris S, Brocco and Kris Kin. Dr Fong's dam Spring Flight won eight times when racing in the United States between 1989 and 1992, recording her best win in the Senorita Stakes. Apart from Dr Fong, she produced Lucky Story who won the Vintage Stakes and the Champagne Stakes in 2003 In July 1996, the yearling was consigned by Taylor Made Sales Agency to the Keeneland sale and was bought for $425,000 by Bluegrass Bloodstock. Dr Fong auction history He then entered the ownership of Ahmed Salman's The Thoroughbred Corp. and was sent to Europe to be trained by Henry Cecil at Newmarket, Suffolk. He was ridden in his European races by Kieren Fallon. Racing career 1997: two-year-old season Dr Fong made his racecourse debut in a seven furlong maiden race at Newbury Racecourse on 18 September 1997. Starting at odds of 8/1 in a seventeen-runner field he took the lead inside the final furlong and won by half a length from the favourite Distant Mirage. In his only other race of the year he started 9/4 second favourite for the Listed Autumn Stakes over one mile at Ascot Racecourse in October. After being restrained by Fallon in the early stages he made his challenge down the centre of the straight, took the lead a furlong out and won by half a length from the filly Equity Princess with a twelve length gap back to the other two runners. After the race, Cecil commented that the colt who was being described as a \\"future star\\" would improve from the race, but would not run again that year. 1998: three-year-old season On 1 May Dr Fong made his three-year-old debut in the ten furlong Newmarket Stakes. Starting the 11/4 favourite against five opponents he pulled hard against Fallon's attempts to restrain him but maintained his unbeaten record, taking the lead a furlong out and winning by half a length from the Barry Hills-trained Sensory. Following his victory, he became regarded as a serious contender for The Derby with very good \\"vibes\\" reportedly coming from the Henry Cecil stable. Twelve days later he ran in one of the most important Derby trials, the Group Two Dante Stakes at York Racecourse and started 3/1 second favourite behind Border Arrow who had finished third in the 2000 Guineas. He briefly took the lead two furlongs out but faded in the closing stages and finished fourth behind Saratoga Springs, City Honours and Border Arrow. City Honours and Border Arrow went on to finish second and third behind High-Rise in the Derby. Dr Fong bypassed the Derby and reappeared in the Prix Jean Prat at Chantilly Racecourse on 31 May. He started the 1.3/1 favourite and finished strongly, but in a five-horse \\"blanket finish\\" he finished third, beaten a neck and a nose by Almutawakel and Gold Away. Dr Fong was brought back in distance for the 153rd running of the St James's Palace Stakes over one mile at Royal Ascot on 16 June. The 2/1 favourite was the Peter Chapple-Hyam trained Victory Note who had won the Poule d'Essai des Poulains on his last start with Dr Fong next in the betting on 4/1 alongside the Irish 2000 Guineas winner Desert Prince. The best of the other five runners appeared to be Fa-Eq (runner up in the Irish Guineas) and the Duke of Devonshire's Duck Row. Fallon restrained the colt towards the rear as Desert Prince set the pace, before making his challenge on the outside in the straight. He caught Desert Prince in the final strides and won by a neck, with a gap of three and a half lengths back to Duck Row in third place. After the race Cecil commented \\"Kieren was a bit upset about his ride in France and thinks he should have won. But I was very pleased with him here- he showed what a great jockey he is\\". In July Dr Fong ran in France again when he carried top weight of 130 pounds in the Prix Eug√®ne Adam over 2000 metres at Maisons-Laffitte Racecourse, with his main opponent appearing to be the Prix Noailles winner Special Quest. He took the lead 200 metres out but hung to the left as he tired in the closing stages and prevailed by only a nose from the Pascal Bary-trained Aware. On his final European start, Dr Fong faced Desert Prince again in the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes over one mile at Ascot on 26 September. Before the race, Cecil reported that the colt was in very good form but said that his optimum trip was probably nine furlongs. He stayed on well in the last quarter mile but could not match the pace of his rival and was beaten half a length with the other beaten horses included Among Men (Sussex Stakes), Muhtathir (Celebration Mile), Cape Cross, Second Empire (Grand Crit√©rium) and Almushtarak (Sandown Mile). In the autumn on 1998 the colt was sent to the United States to be trained by Neil Drysdale. He ran twice in California, with Kent Desormeaux taking the ride on both occasions. He finished second in the Oak Tree Derby at Santa Anita Park on 1 November and fifth when favourite for the Grade One Hollywood Derby four weeks later. 1999: four-year-old season In 1999 Dr Fong remained in the United States where he ran four times without winning. His best effort of the season came on his debut when he was tried on dirt for the first time and finished second in the Strub Stakes. He went on to finish fourth in the Santa Anita Handicap, the Oaklawn Handicap and the American Handicap. Dr Fong was then moved to the stable of John Kimmel but made only one more appearance. Returning to turf, he started favourite for the Grade III Fourstardave Handicap at Saratoga Race Course in August but ran poorly and finished eighth of the eleven runners. Assessment In the International Classification, published in January 1999, Dr Fong was rated the best British three-year-old colt of 1998, and the second best of his age and sex in Europe one pound behind Desert Prince. Stud record After his retirement from Dr Fong returned to England and became a breeding stallion at Lord Hartington's Side Hill Stud in Newmarket before moving to stand at the Highclere Stud in 2005. In 2010 he moved to Haras du Thenney in Normandy where he stood for four year before being sold and exported to Turkey in September 2013. His best winners have included Shamdinan (Secretariat Stakes), Ask for the Moon (Prix Saint-Alary), Aoife Alainn (Premio Lydia Tesio), Testa Rossi (Miss Grillo Stakes), Celimene (Prix Penelope), Diamond Dove (Preis der Winterk√∂nigin) and Beatrice (Schwarzgold-Rennen).

Personal life Hans Dirk de Vries Reilingh, often shortened to Reilingh, was born into a family of doctors in Groningen. His father and his grandfather were both postgraduate doctors. After the death of his father, Reilingh moved to Den Haag. This was where he completed his HSB-b final exams. He then enrolled in social geography studies at the University of Amsterdam. In 1932 he earned his master's degree. His friend, Hendrick van der Wielen (in 1930 promoted by Sebald Rudolf Steinmetz) asked him to teach c courses at Allardsoog, the first Volkshogeschool in the Netherlands. In 1938, Reilingh moved to Markelo, where he founded the volkhogeschool Diependaal. During the Second World War, his work at the volkshogeschool was shut down. Reilingh worked in the war years as a teacher in Almelo and also as a researcher for ISONEVO in Twente. He also finished his thesis during this period. He was awarded cum laude by Steinmetz on November 11, 1945. After the Second World War, Reilingh worked for the Ministry of Education, Arts and Sciences. In 1947, he founded the volkshogeschool Eerbeek. In 1949 Henri Nicolaas ter Veen died. Reilingh was his successor of the same department: Social Geography and Land Description. He retired in 1971. The Volkshogeschool In the preface of his thesis 'De Volkshoogeschool', Reailinh writes that his study came about at the insistence of his professor Steinmetz. Steinmetz has much sympathy for the ideas that underlie the work at the Volkshogeschool. After a short introduction where the goals and methods of the Volkshogeschool as an instrument for community development is outlined, followed by seven chapters about the development of Volkshogeschools in Scandinavia, Germany, Switzerland and the Netherlands. The development in Denmark receives the most attention because this country was the home of volkhogeschool work of Nikolaj Frederik Severin Grundtvig and Christen Mikkelsen Kold. In the second part of his thesis, the various goals, systems and methods of volkhogeschool work are compared with each other. Sociography and Social Geography The Reilingh's views regarding sociology and social geography differed from those of his predecessor Ter Veen. Ten Veen had always developed more to a form of applied Sociology, but Reilingh emphatically studied social phenomenon in the spatial context. In his eyes geographical sociology must remain. See Also Sociale geografie UvA 1950- 1970. Not only did Reilingh have to examine the strong emerging field of sociology but he also had to determine also his own position in the field. In his eyes, social geography was like that in Utrecht and Groningen, where it was concentrated on the field's economic aspects. Large attention was given to the pursuit of human prosperity by the Groningse social geographer Hendrik Jacob Keuning leading Reiling to geographical materialism, causing him to believe that the mental and cultural factors were underexposed. Because of the cultural and political aspects of the study of the relation between the people and the surrounding space received more attention, the meaning of the physical environment received less. For Reilingh the social space, also known as territorial cohabitation, was central. Reilingh explained various emphases in Social Geography and because of that could develop his use of the political and cultural forms of geography at the University of Amsterdam. The Inner City of Amsterdam Until he was appointed as a professor in 1949, Reilingh was highly focussed on the analysis of rural issues. He published, among other things in 1949 a twosome of country monographs for Weerselo and Markelo. In the fifties he continued to regularly publish works about issues of rural character as he researched the regional cultural situation in the province of North-Holland. However, his scientific staff urged him to do more research in urban areas, more relevant to the particular problems of districts, neighbourhoods and inner cities. The postwar housing shortage was for Reilingh and his staff (de Sociografische Werkgemeenschap (Sociographic Work Community)) a stimulus to investigate problems in neighborhoods. One started with field studies of the living conditions in a number of neighbourhoods in the district Bos en Lommer. In the beginning of the sixties the municipality of Amsterdam struggled with the problems of decay and loss of function in the inner city. There was an alderman Joop den Uyl appointed by a municipal commission who invited Reilingh to participate. That was the beginning of an extensive research project under the leadership of Reilingh, Willem Heinemeyer and Michel van Hulten. The research reported on, among other things, land prices, image, accessibility and monuments in ‚ÄòHet Centrum van Amsterdam, een sociografische studie (The Center of Amsterdam, a sociographic study)‚Äô (1968). During this research many national and international contributors were contacted. During 1966, the involved experts brought together a study week 'Urban Core and Inner City'. The discussions there contributed heavily to the meaning of development in Amsterdam. Terrareeks (Terra Series) Reilingh was also active in the publication of geographical books for a wide public. He catered three parts of the Terra Series, that were started by his predecessor, Ter Veen. He wrote the sections on Denmark, Belgium (together with M. Van Haegendoren) and Austria (together with J. Wartha). Editorial Activities Reilingh even edited the magazine Het Gemenebest (The Commonwealth) and he was a co-founder of the Belgian-Dutch magazine Volksopvoeding (People's Education). During the fifties he was a member of the editorial office of Folia Civitatis. He was also a member and later chairman of the magazine Aardrijkskundig Genootschap (Geographical Society). He was also vice president of the editorial office of the Geografisch Tijdschrift (Geographic Magazine).

Early life and family  Lawson was born on 16 June 1890, the eldest son of Colonel William Levy-Lawson (1864‚Äì1943) and his wife Sibyl Mary Marshall, eldest daughter of Lt-Gen Sir Frederick Marshall. His father was the younger son of Edward Levy- Lawson, 1st Baron Burnham, proprietor of The Daily Telegraph and had served in the Scots Guards and then in the part-time Royal Buckinghamshire Yeomanry (Royal Bucks Hussars), with which he had won a Distinguished Service Order (DSO) during the 2nd Boer War.Burke's.Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. His first cousin was the Hon. Mrs Dorothy Coke (n√©e Levy-Lawson, died 1937), wife of Major the Hon. Sir John Coke (died 1957). His daughter Lucia wrote a book about Hall Barn, her home from age 11 and the seat of the Baron Burnham family. Edward Lawson was educated at Eton College and Balliol College, Oxford, where he obtained a third-class degree in modern history in 1913 and played Polo for the university. In 1910 he was commissioned into the Royal Bucks Hussars, of which his father became Honorary Colonel in 1913.Monthly Army List On leaving Oxford, Lawson joined the family newspaper, the Daily Telegraph, as a reporter, first in Paris and then in New York. On the outbreak of war in 1914 he returned to the UK to serve with the Royal Bucks Hussars. World War I The Royal Bucks Hussars was embodied on the outbreak of war and went to its war station near Bury St Edmunds, later joining a concentration of mounted troops around Churn on the Berkshire Downs. In November the 2nd Mounted Division, of which the Royal Bucks formed part, was sent to guard the East Coast in Norfolk. In April 1915 the division was shipped to Egypt, where it was reorganised as a small dismounted division and sent to Gallipoli.Becke, pp. 9‚Äì17. 2nd Mounted Division landed at Suvla Bay on the night of 17/18 August, with Lawson acting as landing officer. Three days later it was sent into action at the Battle of Scimitar Hill, when it was intended to push through to the second objective after the main Turkish positions had been captured. The Yeomanry moved up at 17.00, marching from their bivouacs across the plain of the Salt Lake, where they 'presented such a target as artillerymen dream of'.North, pp. 182‚Äì4. On reaching Chocolate Hill they paused to reorganise before moving on towards Scimitar Hill through blinding dust and smoke, with little idea of what they were supposed to do and suffering heavy casualties. Most of the division halted at Green Hill, but Brigadier-General Lord Longford led his 2nd South Midland Mounted Brigade (including the Royal Bucks Hussars) in a charge over Green Hill and up to the summit of Scimitar Hill. Longford was killed, and his men were finally driven from the summit.North, pp. 184‚Äì6.Aspinall-Oglander, p. 366. The casualties at Scimitar Hill had been so severe, and manpower wastage through the summer was so heavy, that the 2nd South Midland Mounted Brigade had to be temporarily reorganised as a single regiment, and was evacuated to Egypt in November for rest and recuperation, where it was reunited with its horses. After service in the Senussi Campaign with the Western Frontier Force, the Royal Bucks Hussars went to Palestine to join the Imperial Mounted Division, with which it served in the First and Second Battles of Gaza.Perry, Pt 5a, p. 56. The regiment then transferred to the Yeomanry Mounted Division and fought with it in the Third Battle of Gaza and at the Battle of Mughar Ridge, where it participated in a notable mounted charge.Becke, pp. 31‚Äì4.Bullock, pp. 80‚Äì1. It was involved in Allenby's entry into Jerusalem. In April 1918 the Royal Bucks Hussars went to France to serve on the Western Front, but Lawson was not with them: he had been appointed at age 26 acting Lieutenant-Colonel to command the 1st County of London (Middlesex) Yeomanry, which continued to serve with the Desert Mounted Corps in Palestine for the rest of the war, including the Battle of Megiddo.Perry, Pt 5b, p. 22. During the final pursuit towards Damascus, Lawson's regiment was lent to T. E. Lawrence, under whose orders it charged the enemy rear and drove them into a trap, completing the destruction of the Turkish Fourth Army.Bullock, pp. 143‚Äì4.Lawrence, pp. 661‚Äì2. During the war Lawson was awarded a DSO, MC and three mentions in despatches. Newspaperman After the war, Lawson returned to the Daily Telegraph, where he was known as 'The Colonel', and served as effective second-in-command to his uncle Harry Levy-Lawson, 2nd Baron Burnham, who had inherited the newspaper and been created Viscount Burnham. On 28 January 1920 he married Marie Enid Robson, only daughter of Hugh Scott Robson. The Daily Telegraph was losing circulation, and to Lawson's disappointment his uncle decided to sell it to the Berry Brothers in 1927. Sir William Berry (soon to be created Lord Camrose) was impressed by Lawson's ability and made him general manager of the business. Lawson joked that this was because he was the only person capable of finding his way around the labyrinthine Telegraph offices. Lawson was a moderniser and skilful negotiator, supervising the installation of new printing plant, the takeover of The Morning Post in 1937, and chairing the labour committee of the Newspaper Publishers' Association for 25 years. After his father succeeded as 3rd Baron Burnham in 1933, he was styled the Hon. Edward Lawson. Territorial officer Lawson maintained his links to the Territorial Army between the wars, helping the Royal Bucks Hussars to convert to Royal Artillery and then to merge with the Berkshire Yeomanry to form the 99th (Buckinghamshire and Berkshire Yeomanry) Field Brigade, Royal Artillery, which he commanded from 1929 until 1933 (his uncle, Viscount Burnham, was also the regiment's Honorary Colonel).Royal Bucks Hussars at Regiments.org.Litchfield, p. 24. Unusually for a Territorial officer, he was appointed Commander, Royal Artillery, (CRA) of 48th (South Midland) Division in 1938, with the rank of Brigadier. World War II On the outbreak of war, 48th Division was mobilised, and it landed in France as part of the British Expeditionary Force in January 1940.Joslen, p. 78. When the Germans invaded France and the Low Countries in May, the BEF moved forward to occupy pre- planned positions in Belgium, but the rapid German breakthrough into France caused it to retreat towards Dunkirk. On 23 May, 48th Division was pulled out to form a new defence line along the canal between Saint-Omer and the coast. Lawson was sent with 'X Force' of artillery, machine guns and infantry ahead of the division to occupy the chosen positions.Ellis, France & Flanders, Ch. VIII . However, the unexpected surrender of Belgian forces on 27 May 1940 led to a gap appearing between 48th Division in action around Saint-Omer and the coast at Nieuwpoort. Until II Corps could arrive to plug this gap, Lawson was responsible for what the Official History calls 'the most dangerously exposed part of the bridgehead'.Ellis, France & Flanders, Ch. IX . He was ordered by the commander of the Dunkirk perimeter, Lt-Gen Ronald Adam to improvise a defence line along the canal and prevent the Germans breaking through to the vital beaches east of Dunkirk where much of the BEF was waiting to be evacuated. At 11.00 on 28 May, advanced German troops reached the canal line, but Lawson seized on the Territorial gunners of 53rd (London) Medium Regiment, RA who were marching towards Dunkirk having fired off all their ammunition and destroyed their guns. Together with detachments of Regular gunners from 2nd Medium Regiment and 1st Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, and sappers from 7th Field Company Royal Engineers, they fought as infantry to hold the line. They came under heavy mortar and machine-gun fire, and the Germans seized a bridgehead at Nieuwpoort, but all subsequent attacks that day were repulsed. Lawson's scratch force was relieved next day and then evacuated to Britain.Butler & Bradford, pp. 158‚Äì9.Bryant, pp. 144‚Äì5, 149.Chronology at 53rd Regt website. Lawson was awarded a CB for distinguished service in this campaign.Edinburgh Gazette 16 July 1940. In February 1941 he was promoted to Major-General and appointed General Officer Commanding the new Yorkshire County Division, responsible for three Independent Infantry Brigades that had been organised for Home Defence from newly raised battalions.Joslen, p. 117. On the death of his father on 14 June 1943, Edward Lawson succeeded as 4th Baron Burnham of Hall Barn, Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire, and as the 4th Baronet. With his newspaper background, Lawson became Senior Military Adviser to the Ministry of Information and was Director of Public Relations at the War Office from 1943 to 1945. Postwar Lord Burnham returned to the Daily Telegraph as managing director in 1945, remaining in the post until his retirement in 1961. He died in the Middlesex Hospital on 4 July 1963, and was succeeded as 5th Baron by his eldest son.

Though it takes its name from the town of Kubachi in Dagestan, modern-day Russia, scholars believe that Kubachi ware pieces were created during the Safavid Period in the northwestern part of what is now Iran. Nishapur, Tabriz, Mashhad, and Isfahan have all been put forth as possible places of origin for Kubachi ware. Kubachi ware is made of stonepaste (also known as fritware). The decoration varies; some have turquoise glazes with black figures, perhaps in imitation of Chinese celadon. Others are blue on white, similar to Ming porcelain. Blue and white Ming porcelain was widely copied in Persia. The subject matter of Kubachi pieces includes humans, plants, and animals. The style of the pottery, especially the use of polychrome, reveals Ottoman influence, imitating the ceramics of Iznik. This is unsurprising given that Tabriz, one of the manufacturing centers of Kubachi ware, was located along trade routes with the Ottomans and was invaded by them several times. Origin of name The town of Kubachi, located in the Caucasus, was the site of a large collection of 15th- and 16th-century pottery. Starting in the 1870s, many of these ceramic pieces were bought by collectors from Europe and North America and later donated to large museums. The name of the town has stuck with this group of ceramics despite the fact that they were not manufactured in Kubachi. Place of origin The earliest outside visitors to Kubachi assumed the works to be made locally, but this view was quickly discredited. Several competing theories about their place of origin have since been put forth; it has been suggested that the works are actually the products of multiple cities' workshops. Petrofabric analysis suggests that Tabriz may have been the place of production for many works of Kubachi ware. Black-and-turquoise Kubachi ware has been associated with Nishapur via petrofabric analysis. Still other works have been identified with Masshad via inscriptions. The style of the figures on some of the works suggests a link with Isfahan.

Both occupants of the Cessna were killed; the pilot of the F-16 ejected safely. The subsequent investigation found that the local Air Traffic Control unit had failed to ensure adequate separation between the two aircraft.  Collision  At about 11:00 AM on July 7, 2015, the F-16 and Cessna 150 collided over Moncks Corner, South Carolina, about north of Charleston. Witnesses state that the Cessna was climbing when the F-16 hit it broadside. The Cessna (N3601V) was climbing out of the MKS airport under visual flight rules, not in communication with FAA Air Traffic Control. Death 41 (the F-16) was on an ATC assigned heading of 260 degrees and issued a descent to maintain 1600' for an ILS approach to Runway15 at KCHS. At 1100:16, the CHS ATC approach controller issued a traffic advisory advising the F-16 pilot of \\"traffic 12 o'clock, 2 miles, opposite direction, 1,200 [ft altitude] indicated, type unknown.\\" At 1100:24, the F-16 pilot responded that he was \\"looking\\" for the traffic. At 1100:26, the controller advised the F-16 pilot, \\"turn left heading 180 if you don't have that traffic in sight.\\" At 1100:30, the pilot asked, \\"confirm 2 miles?\\" At 1100:33, the controller stated, \\"if you don't have that traffic in sight turn left heading 180 immediately.\\" As the controller was stating the instruction and over the next 18 seconds, the radar-derived ground track of the F-16 began turning southerly toward the designated heading. At 1100:49, the radar target of the F-16 was 1/2 nm northeast of the Cessna, at an altitude of 1,500 ft, and was on an approximate track of 215¬∞. At that time, the Cessna reported an altitude of 1,400 ft and was established on an approximate ground track of 110¬∞. Death 41 and N3601V collided at an approximate altitude of 1450 ft. The F-16 flew for a further three minutes before the pilot transmitted a mayday call. He then ejected safely. Both aircraft crashed in Lewisfield Plantation. Both occupants of the Cessna 150 were killed. The pilot of the F-16 was on an instrument training mission. Its destination was Joint Base Charleston. The Cessna was reported to be on a flight from Berkeley County Airport to Myrtle Beach.  Aircraft  Of the two aircraft involved, the first one was a General Dynamics F-16C Fighting Falcon, serial number 96-0085. It was based at Shaw Air Force Base, South Carolina, and was operated by the 20th Fighter Wing of the United States Air Force. The second one was a privately-owned Cessna 150M light aircraft, registration N3601V. Investigation The National Transportation Safety Board conducted the investigation into the accident.

The film, based on the 2008 novel of the same name by Philip Roth, is set mostly in Ohio in the early 1950s, and stars Logan Lerman, Sarah Gadon, Tracy Letts, Linda Emond, and Danny Burstein. The film had its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival on January 24, 2016, and was released theatrically on July 29, 2016, by Roadside Attractions and Summit Entertainment. Lerman's performance received positive reviews from critics and earned him a Best Actor nomination at the Seattle Film Critics Awards. Plot Marcus Messner is fighting in the Korean War. After an encounter with Chinese troops, he reflects on the choices he made in his life and how they led him to where he is now. In the summer of 1951, before his first year of college, Marcus's synagogue in Newark, New Jersey mourns the death in Korea of one of his classmates. Marcus has been awarded a scholarship to Winesburg College, a private Christian school in Ohio, which allows him to defer the draft. His father, who runs a kosher butcher shop, is unnerved by the deaths in the war of boys like his son and becomes overwhelmed with paranoia. At Winesburg, Marcus is a studious, introverted pupil who feels disconnected from the rest of the student body, including fellow Jewish students. He meets Olivia Hutton, a beautiful student majoring in French literature. The daughter of a Cleveland surgeon, Olivia is freethinking, sophisticated, and sexually frank, but also fragile and disturbed; she feels as alienated and out-of-place as Marcus. On their first date, Olivia ends the evening by performing fellatio on him. The inexperienced Marcus is so shocked that he avoids her for several weeks. As he and Olivia continue to have sexual relations without intercourse, he learns that she is a recovering alcoholic who had been previously enrolled at Mount Holyoke College. After she attempted suicide, she was admitted to the Menninger clinic. Olivia's parents sent her to Winesburg hoping that the \\"squareness\\" of the school would help her become stable. She also makes allusions to having been sexually abused by her father. Marcus decides that he can no longer tolerate his noisy, intrusive roommates and requests to switch to a single room. The university administration schedules a meeting with Dean of Men Caudwell. Though the discussion is ostensibly about the change in his living situation, it becomes an interrogation about Marcus's atheist beliefs and his dislike of Winesburg's conservative culture. The already ill Marcus becomes so agitated that he vomits and passes out. Marcus is rushed to the hospital, where he has an operation for appendicitis. During recovery, he is visited by a senior student who informs him that Olivia has given blow jobs to nearly everyone else on campus. Marcus's mother also visits him and says that she wants a divorce from his father, who is growing increasingly deranged and can no longer run the shop. She meets Olivia, who has come to bring red and white roses to Marcus, and sees the wrist scar from her suicide attempt; they speak away from Marcus when leaving. The next day, Marcus's mother apologizes to him for oversharing her marital problems and promises not to divorce, but only if he ends his relationship with Olivia. She warns him of the dangers of getting too involved with people who are mentally ill, and that her neediness would ruin his potential. When Marcus returns to school, he finds that Olivia has disappeared from the campus and goes to Dean Caudwell to find out what happened to her. Olivia suffered a nervous breakdown and was hospitalized again. The school had been hesitant to accept her, given her history of electroshock therapy and relapses, but her father was an esteemed Winesburg alumnus who requested her admission. The Dean demands to know whether Marcus raped and impregnated Olivia; Marcus is outraged and leaves after using an obscenity. Marcus is expelled after the Dean learns that he paid a student to evade the mandatory chapel requirement, and is drafted. In Korea, Marcus is stabbed with a bayonet during combat. As he collapses, he thinks back on Olivia and wishes that he could tell her that \\"it's okay, whatever it is. 'Cause someone did love you. At least, I think that's what it was\\". Decades later, Olivia lives in a nursing home. She notices the red and white roses on the wallpaper and smiles.

The avifauna of East Timor include a total of 278 species. This list's taxonomic treatment (designation and sequence of orders, families and species) and nomenclature (common and scientific names) follow the conventions of The Clements Checklist of the Birds of the World, 6th edition. The family accounts at the beginning of each heading reflect this taxonomy, as do the species counts found in each family account. Introduced and accidental species are included in the total counts for East Timor. The following tags have been used to highlight several categories, but not all species fall into one of these categories. Those that do not are commonly occurring native species. * (A) Accidental - a species that rarely or accidentally occurs in East Timor * (E) Endemic - a species endemic to East Timor * (I) Introduced - a species introduced to East Timor as a consequence, direct or indirect, of human actions Grebes Order: PodicipediformesFamily: Podicipedidae Grebes are small to medium-large freshwater diving birds. They have lobed toes and are excellent swimmers and divers. However, they have their feet placed far back on the body, making them quite ungainly on land. There are two species which have been recorded in East Timor. *Little grebe, Tachybaptus ruficollis *Australasian grebe, Tachybaptus novaehollandiae Shearwaters and petrels Order: ProcellariiformesFamily: Procellariidae The procellariids are the main group of medium-sized \\"true petrels\\", characterized by united nostrils with medium septum and a long outer functional primary. *Cape petrel, Bulweria capense (A) *Bulwer's petrel, Bulweria bulwerii *Streaked shearwater, Calonectris leucomelas *Wedge-tailed shearwater, Ardenna pacificus Austral storm petrels Order: ProcellariiformesFamily: Oceanitidae The austral storm petrels are the smallest seabirds, relatives of the petrels, feeding on planktonic crustaceans and small fish picked from the surface, typically while hovering.

It was known as \\"Region A\\" in ground-based images taken by the W. M. Keck Observatory on Mauna Kea. The crater was named after Occator, the Roman god of the harrow and a helper to Ceres. The name Occator was officially approved by the IAU on 3 July 2015. On 9 December 2015, scientists reported that the bright spots on Ceres, including those in Occator, may be related to a type of salt, particularly a form of brine containing magnesium sulfate hexahydrite (MgSO4¬∑6H2O); the spots were also found to be associated with ammonia-rich clays. More recently, on 29 June 2016, scientists reported the bright spot to be mostly sodium carbonate (), implying that hydrothermal activity was probably involved in creating the bright spots. In August 2020, NASA confirmed that Ceres was a water-rich body with a deep reservoir of brine that percolated to the surface in various locations causing the \\"bright spots\\", including those in Occator crater. A small dome in the center of the crater is 3 km across and about 340 meters height. It is named Cerealia Tholus and is covered by bright salt deposits named Cerealia Facula. The group of thinner salt deposits to the east are named Vinalia Faculae [sic]. In July 2018, NASA released a comparison of physical features, including Occator, found on Ceres with similar ones present on Earth. __TOC__ Views Context - Center of Occator (enhanced color; LAMO; February 2016) Bright spot may be mostly sodium carbonate (NASA; June 2016).

They relate to the last period of the Baekje Kingdom, representing the period from 475 to 660 CE, which was one of the three kingdoms that flourished from 18 BC to 660 AD. The property designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site has eight archaeological sites. These are: The Gongsanseong fortress (Í≥µÏ£º Í≥µÏÇ∞ÏÑ±) and the royal tombs at Songsan- ri, related to the capital city of Ungjin, now Gongju; the Busosanseong Fortress (Î∂ÄÏÜåÏÇ∞ÏÑ±) and Gwanbuk-ri administrative buildings, the Jeongnimsa Temple, the Neungsan-ri royal tombs, and the Naseong city wall in Sabi, now Buyeo; and the Wanggung-ri Palace and the Mireuksa Temple in Iksan, a subsidiary capital region of Sabi. The Baekje Historic Areas were inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site on 8 July 2015 at the 39th session of the Committee. They were inscribed both as a cultural heritage under Criteria II, for the cultural and architectural features which the ancient East Asian kingdoms of Korea evolved in respect of construction methods and Buddhism and exchanged with China and Japan, and under Criteria III, for the extraordinary architecture, culture, religion, and artistry of the Baekje Kingdom in its capital cities, Buddhist shrines and funerary structures, and stone pagodas. Location The heritage sites are located in the hilly mid-western region of the Republic of Korea, in the Iksansi Buyeogun in the Jeollabukdo, and Gongju- si in Chungcheongnam-do. History Baekje Cultural Land, Buyeo-gun, Chungcheongnam-do In Baekje, an ancient kingdom of Korea that flourished for 678 years from 18 BC to 660 AD, interaction with East Asian countries enabled the development of its own unique culture, differing from those of the other two neighboring kingdoms of Goguryeo and Silla. Baekje had been founded on a small area on the banks of the Hangang River, which is the present-day Seoul (Hanseong), in 18 BC, with population migrating from Goguryeo, and over the years the city was enlarged toward the southwestern part of the country. It became famous culturally and economically. Eventually wars broke out among the three kingdoms, and in the battle Goguryeo won and occupied Baekje, the capital of the Baekje Kingdom. Baekje then relocated from Hanseong to Ungjin, where the Gongsanseong Fortress was erected in 475 AD, and established it as its capital. This relocation facilitated the fledgling state of Baekje to imbibe from Chinese culture and architecture related to city planning, and it also subscribed to Buddhism. Baekje also transmitted its cultural and religious values to Japan, and Ungjin (built in the center of the Geumgang River in the form of a diamond, to the east of Seoul,) became a powerful influence in East Asia. However, there was a further movement of the capital to Sabi, and a powerful kingdom came to be established in Buyeo in 538 AD. This relocation was necessary for reasons of trade and commerce, as the main capital did not have this advantage. Here the city was developed with a royal palace, forts, royal burial grounds, and a security cordon of a city wall. During the regime of the Sabi period ((538‚Äì660 AD), King Seong shifted the capital to Buyeo in 538. Iksan was established as a second capital for administrative purposes. In 660 AD, Baekje suffered defeat at the hands of the Silla, who had aligned with the Tang Dynasty of China. Buddhism found its way to Baekje from China for the first time in the late 4th century. In the 6th century, Gyeomik, a Buddhist monk of Baekje, went to India to learn more about Buddhism and bring back the scriptures, which were translated to the local language. Buddhist philosophy spread widely among all sectors of the society, and the ruler considered himself as Buddha to exercise royal control over his subjects. During this period, many large Buddhist temples and pagodas were built in Baekje. This also enabled a close interaction with China and Japan, not only in the field of religion and philosophy but also in building temples in these countries during the 5th to 7th centuries. This period also witnessed the emergence of East Asia as a \\"geo-cultural circle\\" with a uniform writing pattern with Chinese characters, practice of Buddhism, and adoption of Confucian legal codes. The city prospered for nearly 700 years from 18 BC to 660 AD with its neighbouring kingdoms of Goguryeo to the north and Silla to the east. The historic monuments of the period of Baekje were buried; upon excavation, they were found in a well-preserved condition. These were recorded by the Government of Korea as Heritage sites under the 1962 Cultural Heritage Protection Act, amended 2012, and the 2004 Special Act on the Preservation and Promotion of Ancient Cities, amended 2013. The sites have also been brought under the purview of local governments' Cultural Heritage Protection Ordinances such as the Chungcheongnam-do of 2002 and Jeollabuk-do of 1999. A special organization called the Baekje Historic Areas Conservation and Management Foundation has been set up with all stakeholders on board; central, provincial, and local governments and community associations are involved. An overall Conservation and Management Plan for 2015‚Äì2019 has also been put in place to ensure that the \\"Outstanding Universal Value\\" of the monuments in the inscribed property are well preserved with an appropriate Tourism Management Plan for the sites. Features Gongsanseong Fortress of Gongju The eight sites featured in the heritage list are elaborated. The Gongju Gongsanseong Fortress was initially known as Ungjinseong and subsequently as Gongsanseong during the reign of the Goryeo Dynasty. It occupies an area of , presently in the Geumseong-dong and Sanseong-dong districts. It was unearthed during the archaeological excavations done after 1980s, when the constriction methods in building the forts's rampart, the royal palace, and the associated structures of the royal palace were revealed. The fort is located atop the Gongsan mountain (elevation ) and extends over a length of , with its stone wall in length and the balance made of earth. It was built as a defense fortification adapted to the local topography by linking mountain peaks and bridging the valleys. Following the collapse of the Baekje empire, the ramparts were rebuilt fully as stone walls. The fortress has been illuminated. It functioned both as a defense structure and a royal palace. Tomb of King Muryeong, a royal tomb at Songsan-ri The Royal Tomb of King Muryeong belongs to the 25th king of Baekje. It is also known as the Royal Tombs in Songsan-ri or the Royal Tombs of Baekje. It is located on top of a small hill (elevation ) on the southern side of the Geumgang River. It was unearthed in 1971 in an intact condition, though some excavations had been carried out in 1927 and 1932. When excavated, the King's tomb was found in a well-preserved state with its more than 4,600 antiquities in good condition. The King's queen was also buried here. This was part of six other tombs found among the Royal Tombs at Songsan-ri. The tombs were built around 475 AD after the capital was relocated. The tomb of the King and the tomb no 6 are made of bricks with a vaulted ceiling, while the other five tombs were built as stone chambers with domed ceilings. Busosanseong Fortress of Buyeo The Busosanseong Fortress, located on a small hill, was known in the early period as Sabiseong. It formed the backyard garden of the royal palace and was an emergency escape route. Archaeological excavations carried out in 1993 unearthed this fort. It is situated on the Busosan Mountain (elevation ) located on the northern extremity of Buyeo, on the west bank of the Geumgang River. The fort wall has a perimeter of with a base width of , and it is in height built by the rammed earth method. It has two gates, one on the south and the other on the east; the south gate is the main gate. The finds here also indicate that the fort was in use as a military establishment for more than 1,000 years. The 'Nakhwaam Rock', meaning \\"Rock of Falling Flowers\\", a rock ledge, is known for the Baekje's tragic legend of 3,000 royal ladies committing suicide by jumping off the cliff. The five- storied pagoda of Jeongnim-sa. The Jeongnimsa Temple Site layout is a popular architectural layout throughout Korea and has a \\"pagoda‚Äìprayer hall‚Äìlecture hall layout\\". It is located on a flat terrain and is in the backdrop of the Geumseongsan Mountain to the east and Busosan Mountain to the north. Built during the Sabi period, the temple has engravings on the pagoda that memorialize the Tang Dynasty's victory over Baekje. The temple has a layout of a central gate, prayer and lecture halls, and the monks' residential area, all linked by passages. The buildings were made of wood founded over tiled plinths. The site has a five-story pagoda, in height with a low platform and a high main body on its first level, and with reducing size at further higher levels. Other archaeological finds include many roof tiles and clay figurines. In the Mireuksaji Seoktap site, the temple is a large stone pagoda which is considered the largest temple site not only in Korea but in the whole of East Asia. The eastern tower of the pagoda was refurbished in 1993. The west tower was also under restoration. The Pagoda is well preserved. The Royal Tombs in Neungsan-ri exhibit a change in the architectural style of the ceiling from vaulted to flat. The tombs were excavated between 1915 and 1917. Seven tombs were unearthed here, with six arranged in two rows and the seventh located away. Three tombs have stone chambers with a passage and with vaulted ceilings in hexagonal and square designs. The Naseong City Wall built to defend the city is in length and constructed of earth and stone. It provided security to the northern and eastern part of Sabi. The wall was built with rammed-earth technology, which was then innovative. The eastern part of the wall has been refurbished. The earthen walls have been built with wood planks, twigs, and leaves along certain stretches. Excavations revealed the main gate on the eastern part of Buyeo, next to the Royal Tombs in Neungsan-ri, which was of width built with rectangular stones. Another gate located away was also found in 2013. The Temple Site of Busosan Mountain has on its southwestern slope a Buddhist temple unearthed during excavations in 1980. The temple covers an area of . It has one pagoda and one prayer hall layout. Among the artifacts found here is a gilt-bronze waist belt that is believed to have belonged to a person of high rank.

She helms the production company Free Dream Pictures, located in Burbank, California. She directed and produced the critically acclaimed feature films Purgatory House and Odd Brodsky. She attends filmmaking panels across the country, speaking as an expert on low budget filmmaking. Baer resides in Los Angeles, California with her cinematographer husband Matthew Irving.  Cindy Baer   Career  Cindy Baer is an award-winning film and stage actress, director, and producer who resides in Los Angeles, California. She specializes in independent and often female- centric films. (Film Radar) Baer made her feature debut as both a director and producer with the ground-breaking, micro-budget, independent film, Purgatory House which was written by 14-year-old Celeste Davis. Baer had been mentoring in the Big Sisters of Los Angeles program for several years prior. A postmodernist, art film revealed in four timelines, Purgatory House explores the themes of teen spirituality, addiction and suicide, as if chronicles the afterlife journey of Silver Strand, a troubled teen who abandoned her life of turmoil in search of unconditional love. Ground-breaking in 2001, the movie was shot in the mini-DV format, created with digital cameras and home-based computers, and incorporated extensive blue and green screen compositing and visual effects. Purgatory House marked the beginning of the Democratization of Film. Resonating with audiences and critics alike, the movie went on to win a dozen awards, two Prism Award nominations, critical acclaim and was distributed by Image Entertainment, one of the largest distributors in North America, in 2007. Baer's second feature Odd Brodsky had similar success, screening in 29 film festivals and winning 20 festival awards. A quirky, offbeat, comedy, the story line follows 30-something Audrey Brodsky aka \\"Odd Brodsky\\" (played by Tegan Ashton Cohan) who quits her dreary desk job to pursue her childhood dream of becoming an actress. A departure in genre from her debut Purgatory House, many of the same themes prevail, such as isolation, media/TV influence, and the longing for a deeper connection. It also dabbles in postmodernism, and has elements of magical realism. Odd Brodsky premiered on iTunes in November 2016, and then expanded to a wider VOD release roll-out in 2017 including Amazon, Hulu, Google Play and others. In addition to her stage and film work, Baer is a self-made entrepreneur who has founded four companies, including the two non-profit organizations The Mosaic Theatre company in 2000 and Patron of the Arts in 2009. She founded the production company Free Dream Pictures in 2001, and the successful children's entertainment company Daizy the Clown & Company at the young age of 22, which she later sold. Baer started her career as an actress at the age of 14 at the Boston Children‚Äôs Theatre and went on to perform in over two dozen plays. She starred in and produced the 30th Anniversary production of the stage play _Butterflies Are Free_ , which was written by _Leonard Gershe_ , at the Matrix Theatre in Hollywood, California (PRLOG).

Her father, Emil Julius Rosenthal, had settled in Riverside in 1872 from M√ºelhasen, Th√ºringen, Prussian (Germany), and married Anna Jane Unruh. Rosenthal launched her career as an artist in Los Angeles in the 1910s, when progressive trends were emerging in southern California art. Rosenthal was close to Helena Dunlap, the pioneer Los Angeles modernist and founder in 1916 of the Los Angeles Modern Art Society, one of the first modernist groups to form in the region.Susan M.

American Women Modernists: The Legacy of Robert Henri, 1910-1945 (Provo, Utah: Brigham Young University Museum of Art, 2005), 187-188 Following her European tour, she married Charles ‚ÄúJack‚Äù Charash, a press agent, theatrical manager, dramatist, and co-founder of the Anglo-Jewish Theatre, a unit of the WPA Federal Theatre Project. In the late 1920s, Rosenthal published a series of portfolios featuring design motifs drawn from the art and artifacts of an international array of museum collections. The Prim-Art Series portfolios are arranged around themes such as transportation, costumes, and animal motifs. The series signaled her study of ethnographic or 'primitive' art and culture and were instrumental in winning her two Guggenheim awards to work in Mexico. The portfolios helped introduce new aesthetics to design, and were acclaimed as useful resources for professional designers and as teaching tools for art instructors. Rosenthal was a lifelong art instructor and educator, having earned a degree in teaching from Los Angeles State Teachers College in 1910, and Teachers College of Columbia University in 1913. She taught painting and drawing in Columbia University's Teachers College from 1924 to 1931, and at James Monroe High School in the Bronx thereafter. Doris Rosenthal produced a large body of work over a six-decade career.

Since 1998, Ely has served as a pulmonologist, professor and researcher at Vanderbilt. His research is focused on the diagnosis, causes, and management of delirium and other cognitive disorders developed during a patient's hospital stay, especially in geriatric patients. He founded and currently heads the ICU Delirium and Cognitive Impairment Study Group at Vanderbilt. Ely's group has been studying the long term effects of mechanical ventilation and sedation on patients in intensive care units (ICU). The group also publishes a website in an attempt to educate potential patients, families, doctors and other healthcare professionals about the effects and causes of delirium and post-intensive care syndrome (PICS). Ely is one of several physicians that encourages a reduction in the use of sedatives (especially benzodiazepines) to shorten patients‚Äô time on mechanical ventilation during ICU treatment. With others at Vanderbilt, the team also developed an outpatient post-ICU clinic for patients at Vanderbilt. Ely was also a co-chair of the ICU Liberation Campaign of Society for Critical Care Medicine, which encourages the use of protocols to mitigate the effects of delirium and PICS. Together with Pratik Pandharipande, Ely co-directs the Critical Illness, Brain Dysfunction and Survivorship Center (CIBS Center) at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.  Research  In 1996, while serving as chief resident at Bowman Gray, Ely and his colleagues published the findings of a study into the efficacy of a ventilator weaning protocol (called spontaneous breathing trials) in shortening the duration an ICU patient required assistance through mechanical ventilation as well as reducing complications and cost of care. The study published in The New England Journal of Medicine reported that \\"daily screening followed by spontaneous breathing trials in medical and coronary intensive care units reduced the duration of ventilation from a median of 6.0 to 4.5 [days].\\" In 2001, Ely and Gordon Bernard were investigators on a study of the recombinant-form Activated Protein C (known as Drotrecogin alfa) and its possible efficacy in the treatment of sepsis. The same year, Ely and his ICU Delirium Study Group developed CAM-ICU based on an earlier Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) developed by Sharon Inouye. CAM-ICU is one of two commonly used methods to diagnose delirium in ICU patients. It has been validated in later independent studies, with a meta-analysis review of these studies showing high \\"pooled values for sensitivity and specificity of 80% and 95.9%, respectively.\\" Also in 2001, Ely was awarded The American Federation for Aging Research's Paul B. Beeson Career Development Award. In 2002, Ely was appointed Associate Director of Research at the Tennessee Valley Geriatric Research Education and Clinical Center (GRECC), part of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. In a 2004 study, Ely et al. reported that delirium predicted an increased risk of mortality in ICU patients. This has since been confirmed in at least two additional cohort studies. In 2006, Ely was inducted into the American Society for Clinical Investigation for his work demonstrating how \\"delirium is associated with a tripling of the risk of death within 6 months of ICU\\" hospitalization. In 2007, Ely, Pandharipande et al. published the results of the MENDS trial which investigated \\"the incidence and duration of delirium\\" when using the sedative dexmedetomidine compared to a benzodiazepine (specifically lorazepam). This and subsequent studies have resulted \\"in the recommendation to minimize the use of benzodiazepines in the most recent sedation guidelines.\\" In July 2007, Ely along with Timothy D. Girard and their colleagues presented the findings of a randomized clinical trial of a daily protocol of attempts at awakening the patient and allowing them to breathing independently. The 335-patient study presented at the International Conference of the American Thoracic Society reported that these daily tests, where the ICU patient was allowed to come out of sedation and breathe spontaneously without the use of a ventilator, resulted in the patients leaving the hospital an average of four days earlier. In 2010, Ely and Girard reported a correlation between the length of time the patient was affected by delirium and their cognitive outcome in the long-term. They developed a protocol named ABC which took earlier demonstrated attempts at ceasing sedation and paired it with concurrent attempts at a spontaneous breathing trial through the ventilator weaning method developed by him in 1996. Ely and his colleagues later extended the protocol, renamed ABCDEF Bundle, to include advice on the choice of sedation drugs, monitoring of delirium, early exercise, and encouragement of family participation. In 2013, Ely was inducted into the Association of American Physicians. In October 2013, Ely, Pandharipande, and their team published the results of a study, sponsored by the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Veterans Affairs, about the long- term effects of ICU Delirium. The study reported that even after a one-year period, \\"34 percent of patients [affected by ICU Delirium] were still functioning on the same level as someone with moderate traumatic brain injury and 24 percent at the level of a person with mild Alzheimer's.\\" In 2018, he reported to the annual congress of the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine the results of the MIND-USA study into the efficacy of haloperidol and ziprasidone in the treatment of delirium. The antipsychotic drugs used for decades for the treatment of ICU delirium were found to be ineffective for that purpose, according to the study by Ely and his colleagues published in the NEJM. During the Covid-19 pandemic, Ely warned that efforts to mitigate delirium had been erased by the disease. Covid-19 patients also show a higher prevalence of hospital delirium. As well as recommending the ABCDEF Bundle to lower the incidence of delirium in Covid-19 patients and prevent PICS, Ely and other researchers at the CIBS Center also initiated studies into the effects of delirium on Covid-19 patients and their increased \\"risk of developing long- term cognitive issues, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder.\\"  Views  Ely writes reflective opinion pieces and editorials about his personal experiences as a physician, which have been published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, JAMA, and The Wall Street Journal, among other periodicals. He participates in the ongoing debate on euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide through medical literature and international debates. He also wrote a CNN Opinion piece describing his own experiences with patients in palliative care who desired assisted suicide. In May 2019, Ely wrote an opinion article published in USA Today, arguing against \\"death by donation\\", a practice currently illegal in the U.S. and Canada where a patient voluntarily donates their organs while still alive, subsequently leading to their death. In late June 2020, Ely wrote a Perspective article for The Washington Post describing the difficulties of treating Covid-19 patients while conducting ethical research into new treatment regimens for the disease and its effects including delirium.  Personal life  Ely has three daughters with his wife Kim Ely, who also works at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. She is a surgical pathologist who graduated from Massachusetts Institute of Technology and like her husband attended Tulane University School of Medicine. He is the president of the Nashville Guild of the Catholic Medical Association.

It features narrations that Williams released under the pseudonym Luke the Drifter. Background Spoken word, moralistic narrations and talking blues had always been a tradition in country music and were still commercially viable in the late 1940s; T. Texas Tyler's narration of \\"Deck of Cards\\" became one of the best selling records of 1948. Still, Williams' producer Fred Rose remained dubious: :\\"Rose's objection was rooted in commercial logic: jukebox operators had huge standing orders for Hank Williams records and, if the recitations were issued under Hank's name, the operators would complain. Virtually all of the operators serviced bars, and the last thing they needed was for someone to punch up a Hank Williams record and get a sermon.\\" Rose and Williams settled on the pseudonym \\"Luke the Drifter.\\" No attempt was made to hide the fact that Hank was Luke the Drifter, and the singer would play along; on his radio shows he would say, \\"And here's a number by one of my closest relatives, Luke the Drifter,' or he'd say, \\"Here's one by my half brother.\\" Williams' insistence on doing the material, which he must have known would not result in hits, speaks to his artistry; in the episode of American Masters dedicated to the singer, his grandson Hank Williams III states, \\"While Hank was at the peak of his career, he had another side to him that he wanted to get out, and that side was called Luke the Drifter. And a lot of people didn't understand the Luke the Drifter side. That's a dark side, man.\\" In the same documentary, songwriter Danny Dill confirms, \\"He was fascinated by the dark side of life.\\" Luke the Drifter became a kind of alter ego for Williams, with country music historian Colin Escott observing in his essay for the 2001 Polygram album Hank Williams as Luke the Drifter: Beyond the Sunset, \\"If Hank could be headstrong and willful, a backslider and a reprobate, then Luke the Drifter was compassionate and moralistic, capable of dispensing all the wisdom that Hank Williams ignored.\\" thumb Recording and composition The Luke the Drifter songs were recorded at various sessions between January 1950 and July 1952 at Castle Studio in Nashville with Fred Rose producing. Williams' immense popularity and unflagging commercial success left Rose and MGM no choice but to indulge his wish to record the recitations, and the first session, held on January 10, 1950, produced four songs: \\"Too Many Parties and Too Many Pals,\\" \\"Beyond the Sunset,\\" \\"The Funeral,\\" and \\"Everything's Okay.\\" Although credited to Williams, \\"The Funeral\\" had existed for years as a poem written by Will Carleton and recounts a black child's funeral. Although \\"uncomfortably patronizing by today's standards,\\" there is no hint of anything other than sincerity in Hank's delivery. While the Luke the Drifter recordings are primarily associated with sad songs, they also included wry compositions about love and even politics; on August 31, 1950, Williams recorded the anti-Stalin novelty \\"No, No, Joe,\\" which had been written by producer Fred Rose as a warning to the Russian leader as the Cold War began gaining momentum. In addition, \\"Just Waitin'\\" and \\"I've Been Down That Road Before\\" are witty commentaries on the peculiarities of human behavior. One number composed by Williams, \\"Please Make Up Your Mind,\\" was likely directed at his wife Audrey Williams; their tempestuous marriage would end in divorce in 1952, and the songs sound like pleas of reconciliation. Williams also covered the Bonnie Dodd narration \\"Be Careful of Stones that You Throw,\\" which takes aim at small-town gossip based on the social mores of the time; the song recounts the heroic act of a young lady who is killed while saving a child from a passing car, the same child whose mother had previously ostracized her. Williams recorded three songs under the guise of Luke the Drifter that are considered classics: \\"Ramblin' Man,\\" \\"Pictures from Life's Other Side,\\" and \\"Men with Broken Hearts.\\" The latter was a song of which its composer was extremely proud; in the liner notes to the 2001 Mercury album Beyond the Sunset, Williams is quoted asking journalist Allen Rankin, \\"Ain't that the awfulest, morbidest song you ever heard in your life? Don't know how I happen to write that thing, except that somebody that fell, he's the same man as before he fell, ain't he?\\" In the American Masters film, Danny Dill recalls, \\"He was simply overwhelmed by that song, 'Men with Broken Hearts.' And it was so sad, it was awful! But he loved it.\\" The arrangement of \\"Pictures from Life's Other Side\\" is credited to Williams but some researchers date it to around 1880 and cite a singing-school teacher from Athens, Georgia named John B. Vaughan as its composer, while others credit Charles E. Baer. Regardless, the song was well known; Woody Guthrie cut a version of it in 1944. Perhaps the most well known Luke the Drifter song is \\"Ramblin' Man,\\" a rare, minor key dirge that features a taut, edgy vocal from Williams as he sings about wanderlust and loneliness. His keening falsetto and Harold Bradley's steel guitar echoed the song's sentiments, but it also contained a folk edge atypical for a Hank Williams recording. Reception Bruce Eder of AllMusic: \\"For those unfamiliar with them, the songs are all well-chosen and they work within the context of devotional and cautionary songs, Williams easily slipping into this mode of performance, usually with a gospel organ accompaniment and very understated steel guitar - the one mood-breaker, much closer to Williams' secular material, is the upbeat, dark-humored, almost comical 'Everything's Okay,' which basically holds that 'we're still a-livin'/so everything's okay.'\\" In his autobiography Chronicles: Volume One, Bob Dylan states: \\"The Luke the Drifter record, I just about wore out. That's the one where he sings and recites parables, like the Beatitudes. I could listen to the Luke the Drifter record all day and drift away myself, become totally convinced in the goodness of man.\\" Track listing All tracks composed by Hank Williams; except where indicated. #\\"Pictures from Life's Other Side\\" (Traditional; arrangement by Hank Williams) - 2:49 #\\"Men with Broken Hearts\\" - 3:08 #\\"Help Me Understand\\" - 2:54 #\\"Too Many Parties and Too Many Pals\\" (Billy Rose, Mort Dixon, Ray Henderson) - 2:58 #\\"Please Make Up Your Mind\\" - 2:48 #\\"I've Been Down That Road Before\\" - 2:54 #\\"Be Careful of Stones that You Throw\\" (Bonnie Dodd) - 2:57 #\\"I Dreamed About Mama Last Night\\" (Fred Rose) - 2:59 #\\"The Funeral\\" - 3:03 #\\"Beyond the Sunset\\" (Blanche Kerr Brock, Virgil P.

Early life Mariella Norma Borthwick was born in Highfield, Higher Bebington, Chester, on 25 July 1862. She was one of five daughters and three sons of the merchant George Borthwick, and Mary Elizabeth Borthwick (n√©e MacDonald). Though she was born in England, Borthwick considered herself a Scot of Gaelic descent. From an early age she displayed an interest in the culture of Ireland, and learned the Irish language at the Southwark Literary Society in London. Work with the Irish language A talented artist, Borthwick found fame in Ireland first through her sketches of tenant evictions on the Olphert estate in Gweedore, County Donegal which were published by United Ireland in late 1890. She became involved in the language movement in London and Dublin, visiting the west of Ireland and the Aran Islands regularly. In January 1895, Borthwick joined the Gaelic League in London, and while living on Markham Square, Chelsea acted as its treasurer. She won a prize for her essay, Br√≠ na teanga i gc√∫is na n√°isi√∫ntachta (The significance of language to the nationalist cause), at the inaugural Oireachtas na Gaeilge in 1897, under the pseudonym \\"Aodh Rua\\" (Red Hugh). The following year she won a prize in singing. When the Irish Texts Society was created on 26 April 1898 in London Borthwick and Eleanor Hull were the first secretaries.The Origins of the Irish Texts Society, HistoryIreland.com; retrieved 8 July 2015. From May to December 1898 Borthwick served on the central council of the Gaelic League as secretary, and became a member of the executive council in 1899. The same year she was secretary to the year's Oireachtas na Gaeilge, with her \\"education and taste\\" noted as beneficial to the organisation. Borthwick was the chairman of the new Gaelic League branch in Drumcondra, Dublin in 1900. After her resignation from the League, there was a dearth of prominent and strong female voices within the organisation. Norma Borthwick's book illustrated by Jack Butler Yeats Borthwick assisted Eoin MacNeill in the publication of An Claidheamh Soluis, going on to write a series in Irish for St Patrick's magazine from 1900 to 1903, under the name \\"Fear na M√≥na\\". In 1900, she wrote and illustrated Aigibitir na Gaeilge, and in 1902 produced a three-volume textbook Ceachta beaga Gaeilge, illustrated by Jack Butler Yeats.Ceachta beaga Gaeilge profile, archive.org; accessed 13 February 2016. (There is a drawing of Borthwick by his father John Butler Yeats.Drawing of Borthwick dated 1902, icollector.com; accessed 13 February 2016.) Borthwick founded the Irish Book Company with Mair√©ad N√≠ Raghallaigh, which initially operated from O'Connell Street, and later Eccles Street in Dublin. From there, she published a number of books and pamphlets, such as seven booklets of songs under the title Ceol Sidhe. The company also published Father Peadar Ua Laoghaire's , with Borthwick preparing a dictionary for the book. She was later named as one of literary executors. In a collaboration with Osborn Bergin, she published Leour√≠n na leanav in 1913. Borthwick was an acquaintance of Lady Gregory, staying at her house at Coole and teaching Gregory and local English-speakers Irish. During one stay, she held an Irish-language Punch and Judy show with Douglas Hyde. She taught Irish in the Dominican convent on Eccles Street, and was a private Irish tutor to numerous wealthy families. Later life Borthwick left Ireland in 1919 to live with her sister Grace Hay Borthwick, due to her own declining health. They first lived in Newcastle upon Tyne, then Scalfay in the Shetland Islands, and finally at Kilbride House, Kilbride, Skye in the late 1920s. By this point Borthwick was paralysed and unable to speak, having contracted encephalitis lethargica or sleeping sickness in the wake of World War I.

Born in Caracal, his parents were Grigore Carianopol, a court clerk, and his wife Atena (n√©e Popescu) He attended primary school (1916-1920) and the first two grades of secondary school (1920-1922) at the city's Ioni»õƒÉ Asan High School. After fleeing home twice, the first time at age fourteen, his father sent him to a Bucharest military school for munitions specialists. He attended this institution from 1924 to 1930, becoming a specialist in the manufacture of gunpowder and explosives. However, he abandoned the army and audited courses at the University of Bucharest's literature and philosophy faculty from 1934 to 1938. Meanwhile, he worked as a civilian employee in various sectors of the army, including the arsenal and censorship. He made his literary debut in 1928, in Vraja magazine. Pen names he used include V. Olteanu, V. Jianu, V. CƒÉlugƒÉru, V. Cariopol and Vicar. His first book, Flori de spin (1931), along with two that appeared soon after, Virgil Carianopol (1933) and Un ocean, o frunte √Æn exil (1934), form part of his first, avant-garde phase. His next period included Scrisori cƒÉtre plante (1936), which won a prize from the Romanian Writers' Society; Carte pentru domni»õe (1937); Frunzi»ôul toamnei mele (1938) and ScarƒÉ la cer (1940). These volumes marked a transition toward a traditional G√¢ndirism. His later works included C√¢ntece de amurg (1969), Viorile v√¢rstei (1972), Lirice (1973), Elegii »ôi elegii (1974), Lumini pentru dragostea mea (1978) and C√¢ntec la plecarea verii (1981). They are marked by a clearer lyricism, the stylization of older motifs and the crystallization of elegiac inflections, reflections of his own voice, into a melancholic melody of life's ephemeral quality.

The NCSC was developed in 2013 and formally established by the Irish government in July 2015. It is responsible for Ireland's cyber security, with primary focus on securing government networks, protecting critical national infrastructure, and assisting businesses and citizens in protecting their own systems. The NCSC incorporates the Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT-IE). The NCSC is headquartered at 29/31 Adelaide Road, Dublin 2. Mandate and organisation The mandate for the NCSC includes; * activities to reduce the vulnerability of critical systems and networks within the state to incidents and cyber-attacks; * effective response when such attacks occur; * responsibility for the protection of critical information infrastructure; * establishing and maintaining cooperative relationships with national and international partners. Threats identified to Ireland's critical infrastructure and government networks include: lone individuals, activist groups, criminal groups, terrorist groups, and nation states seeking to gather intelligence or to damage or degrade infrastructure. Incidents arising through extreme weather, human error and hardware or software failure also pose significant risks to individuals, businesses and public administration. Work relating to the National Cyber Security Centre, and any records associated with the security of ICT systems in the state and outside it, are exempt from being disclosed under freedom of information (FOI). Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT-IE) The Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT-IE) was established in late 2011 (prior to the official formation of the NCSC) within the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, and includes secondees from other government agencies. The main role of CSIRT-IE is to provide a 24/7 expert emergency response to computer security incidents across all public sector bodies, as well as providing advice to reduce threat exposure. CSIRT-IE engages in emergency planning with government agencies overseen by the Office of Emergency Planning (OEP) within the Department of Defence and the Government Task Force on Emergency Planning, chaired by the Minister for Defence. CSIRT-IE shares information with the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA). Outlining the future core aspects of work of the NCSC, the government's National Cyber Security Strategy 2015-2017 states that the NCSC is to seek formal international accreditation for a Government CSIRT (g/CSIRT), expected in 2016, and accreditation will be sought for a formal National CSIRT (n/CSIRT), while also developing a capacity in the area of Industrial Control Systems and SCADA, which are used to run vital state networks such as electricity, water and telecommunications. Inter-departmental cooperation CIS Corps work closely with the NCSC There is a strong culture of cooperation between the National Cyber Security Centre and the Irish Defence Forces in areas regarding technical skill sets, technical information sharing and exercise participation. Arrangements are due to be formalised by means of a Service Level Agreement with the Department of Defence, including a mechanism for the immediate sharing of technical expertise and information in the event of a major national cyber incident or emergency. The branch of the Irish military with responsibility for cyber defence is the Communications and Information Services Corps (CIS). The Garda S√≠och√°na, the national police service, is involved with the NCSC in a preventative and investigative capacity, with regards to national security and computer crime. Its liaison relationships with international security services is particularly helpful to the NCSC in identifying emerging threats and vulnerabilities, and establishing best practice preventative measures. There is to be a Memorandum of Understanding with the Department of Justice and Equality on this matter, and upcoming cyber legislation will support the work of the National Cyber Security Centre. There is also a Memorandum of Understanding with the Centre for Cybersecurity & Cybercrime Investigation (CCI) at University College Dublin, Europe's leading centre for research and education in cybersecurity, cybercrime and digital forensics.

Its only species is currently Cosmopolitodus hastalis, the broad-tooth mako (other common names include the extinct giant mako and broad-tooth white shark). It is an extinct mackerel shark that lived between thirty to one million years ago during the Oligocene to the Early Pleistocene epochs. Its teeth can reach lengths up to 3.5 in (7.5 cm) and are found worldwide. It is believed to be an ancestor to the great white shark, a fact supported by the transitional species Carcharodon hubbelli, and most likely would have been one of the major predators in its ecosystem; preying upon small whales and other mammals. Taxonomy Etymology Cosmopolitodus is derived from the Ancient Greek Œ∫ŒøœÉŒºŒøœÄŒøŒªŒØœÑŒ∑œÇ \\"kosmopol√≠tƒìs\\" meaning \\"citizen of the world\\" and ·ΩÄŒ¥œéŒΩ \\"od·πìn\\" meaning \\"tooth\\". The species name hastalis may be derived from the Latin word hasta meaning \\"spear\\". The disputed species xiphodon is derived from the Ancient Greek ŒæŒØœÜŒøœÇ \\"x√≠phos\\" meaning \\"sword\\" and ·ΩÄŒ¥œéŒΩ \\"od·πìn\\" meaning \\"tooth\\". Taxonomic history Fossil teeth of C. hastalis The taxonomy of C. hastalis, especially the status of its genus, has a messy history and has long been subjected to debate. The initial scientific names was first given as Oxyrhina hastalis and Oxyrhina xiphodon for the narrow and broad-form variations respectively by Swiss naturalist Louis Agassiz in his 1843 paper Recherches sur les poissons fossiles, although some indications show that he had coined the taxon as early as 1838. Throughout the early and mid 20th century, different genera and species of other lamniformes would be clumped into the two taxa as the genus Oxyrhina began to be used as a wastebasket taxon. Sharks previously identified as variations of Oxyrhina hastalis or Oxyrhina xiphodon included two species of extinct ancestral makos Isurus desori and Isurus retroflexus, the serrated mako (Carcharomodus escheri), and the false-toothed mako (Parotodus benedenii). Eventually, later studies would begin to show that much of the sharks within the genus and two species are distinct from each other, discarding the genus Oxyrhina altogether and creating another issue on what new taxa the sharks should be placed in. As of now, the genus is still uncertain and debated. Shortly after the discarding of the genus Oxyrhina, a review by Holec et al. (1995) placed the species hastalis and xiphodon as a species of mako under the genus Isurus, citing the similarities between the teeth of the two and that of modern mako sharks. In 2001, a study by Ward & Bonavi (2001) considered Isurus hastalis and Isurus xiphodon as conspecific and declared the latter a nomen dubium. Although this conclusion is widely accepted, some scientists disagree, with a study by Whitenack and Gottfried (2010) demonstrating geometrically morphological differences between I. hastalis and I. xiphodon. The scientific name Isurus hastalis is considered as the \\"traditional view\\" in the debate regarding the shark's taxonomy. Ward & Bonavi (2001) reexamined the teeth of I. hastalis and noted a strong morphological similarity between it and the extant great white shark. The study concluded that I. hastalis is a direct ancestor of the great white and is more related to it than other makos. This moved the species into the genus Cosmopolitodus, which was a move that was first proposed by Glikman (1964) but was long rejected beforehand. Later discoveries supports Ward & Bonavi's conclusion of its ancestry to the great white. An analysis of a newly discovered Carcharodon hubbelli by Ehret et al. (2012) further cemented the theory of C. hastalis ancestry to the great white, however also proposed that Cosmopolitodus should be moved to Carcharodon, remarking that the two genera were separated solely due to the lack of serrations in C. hastalis and the lack of lateral cusplets in C. carcharias and pointing out examples of Late Miocene C. hastalis teeth showing basal serrations. Cione et al. (2012) also noted a possibility of moving all species in the genus Cosmopolitodus into the genus Carcharodon to avoid a possible paraphyly that would occur if one of them, which was traditionally identified as C. xiphodon, is a putative sister species of C. carcharias. However, the study also noted that this would only be done if the putative sister species is conspecific with C. hastalis. The study concluded that there is indeed a putative sister species of C. carcharias distinct from C. hastalis and proposed the taxon Carcharodon plicatilis for it, resolving the paraphyly issue. Evolution C. hastalis is believed to be the ancestor of two lineages. The broad-form gave rise to the extant genus Carcharodon, while the narrow-form was the ancestor of two now-extinct sharks. Description An example of a broad form C. hastalis tooth. A narrow form C. hastalis from the Pliocene of Italy. C. hastalis teeth can grow up to 3.5 inches in length, suggesting a very large shark. Their bodies are probably very similar to that of modern great whites, or a transition between them and ancient makos. They are also believed to have a cosmopolitan distribution, with teeth being found worldwide. The species is also divided into two forms based on tooth morphology, each with a unique evolutionary line. Broad- form The broad form is characterized by broad-shaped teeth often described as being identical to that of modern great whites besides the lack of serrations.. Fossil evidence shows that the broad-form is the direct ancestor of the genus Carcharodon, and specimens from the Pisco Formation in Peru show an evolutionary mosaic between them. This form is also commonly labeled by its species synonym xiphodon to reflect its difference from the narrow-form, although this is scientifically invalid.http://www.elasmo.com/genera/slides/gw_evo/gw_evo.html?gwa Narrow- form The narrow form has more slender teeth than its broad-form counterpart, which resemble broadened Isurus oxyrhinchus teeth. Unlike the broad-form, the narrow form is believed to be the ancestor of two extinct sharks, the hooked-tooth \\"mako\\" (Cosmopolitodus/Isurus planus), and the serrated \\"mako\\" (Carcharomodus escheri) Paleobiology Hunting behavior C. hastalis was a confirmed hunter of marine mammals. Trace fossils in the form of tooth marks on the bones of a Pliocene dolphin of the species Astadelphis gastaldii reveal that C. hastalis attacked its prey from below and behind, much as the modern great white shark does. The deepest bite marks on the dolphin's ribs indicate the shark aimed for the abdomen of its prey to inflict a fatal bite quickly and incapacitate its prey, and that when the dolphin was attacked a second time, it was bitten near the dorsal fin, suggesting that the dolphin rolled over while injured. The size of the bites indicates further that the shark responsible was estimated to be long.

During the strike, students operated a radio station known as \\"La Ke Huelga\\". Several people involved with that station, and with other similar projects, banded together to form a new station project known as La Voladora (\\"The Flyer\\"). Initially conceived as being a moving, 20-watt FM radio station that would visit rural areas. As part of that project, La Voladora set up shop in Amecameca on October 27, 2000, on 102.1 MHz, without a permit to operate. In December 2000, Popocat√©petl, the nearby volcano, recorded its largest eruption in 1,200 years. As a result of the natural emergency, La Voladora opted to remain in Amecameca permanently. Additionally, the station began to fight to obtain a permit, and in May 2005, La Voladora received a permit for XHECA-FM on 97.3 MHz. In August 2017, the Federal Telecommunications Institute approved a relocation of the station's transmitter.

Based in London, it became operational in October 2016, and its parent organisation is GCHQ. History The NCSC absorbed and replaced CESG (the information security arm of GCHQ), the Centre for Cyber Assessment (CCA), Computer Emergency Response Team UK (CERT UK) and the cyber-related responsibilities of the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure (CPNI). It built on earlier efforts of these organisations and the Cabinet Office to provide guidance on Information Assurance to the UK's wider private sector, such as the \\"10 Steps\\" guidance released in January 2015. In pre-launch announcements, the UK government stated that the NCSC would first work with the Bank of England to advise financial institutions on how to bolster online defences. The centre was first announced in November 2015 by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne. The existing Director General Cyber of GCHQ, Ciaran Martin, leads the new centre, and GCHQ's current Technical Director of Cyber Security, Dr Ian Levy, assumed the same role at the NCSC. A detailed paper on the creation of the NCSC, including a description of its structure and future challenges, written by the then Director of GCHQ, Robert Hannigan, who is widely credited with establishing the centre, was published by the Royal United Services Institute in February 2019. The centre was dedicated by the Queen on 14 February 2017. Philip Hammond, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, announced an investment of ¬£1.9 billion and an initiative to embed 100 people from industry into the NCSC on secondment. In April 2016, the Ministry of Defence announced that a Cyber Security Operations Centre (CSOC) \\"to protect the MOD's cyberspace from malicious actors\\" with a budget of over ¬£40 million will contribute to this initiative. It is located at MoD Corsham. In October 2017, technical director Ian Levy was targeted by email prankster James Linton with a fake industry event, however Levy correctly identified the unexpected headers and worked with him to put out a security blog about the incident. On 1 September 2020 Lindy Cameron, formerly director-general of the Northern Ireland Office, took over from Ciaran Martin as CEO.

Plot A new dress plays a key role in the lives of four women who are not acquainted with each other. A daring strapless design, \\"Nude at Midnight,\\" is unveiled in Paris to the delight of socialite Gogo Montaine, who wants to dazzle the Maharajah of Kim-Kepore, her escort that night. She charges its $900 cost to a former lover, Louis-Jean, who turns up later and refuses to pay. The Raj begins paying more attention to the gambling tables, so Gogo uses her dress and charms to get back into Louis-Jean's good graces. A buyer from New York City has an underling copy the Paris dress's design and quickly manufactures a cheaper version of it. Betty Barnes, a secretary, spends $90 on one to impress her boss, attorney Edgar Blevins, hoping to woo him away from Cora, his wife. Cora eavesdrops on her at the dress shop. While her husband is admiring Betty in it, Cora turns up in exactly the same dress, diverting her husband's wandering eyes. Marion Parmalee wants a promotion for her husband, whose boss P.J. Sullivan is retiring to Florida with his wife. At the retirement party, wearing a \\"Nude at Midnight\\" dress she bought for $59, Marion flirts with P.J., a bed manufacturer. When they get caught atop a bed together, P. J.'s wife instantly names another man at the party as her husband's successor. In far-off Los Angeles, a 21st-birthday party and a desire for boyfriend Charlie to propose marriage to her motivate Marta Jensen into buying an eye-catching dress, \\"Nude at Midnight,\\" a copy of which she finds on sale for $19. They have difficult getting a table at Michael Romanoff's popular restaurant, frustrating Charlie until he gets an eyeful of Marta in her gown.

In that capacity she was stationed in The Hague and was a member of the Council of Ministers of the Kingdom. Personal life Wiels was born on 15 May 1963 and is a sister of the murdered politician Helmin Wiels. She is a single mother of two children. Minister Plenipotentiary Wiels has received criticism for errors in her CV, amongst others relating to a MSc title, as well as the nature of her work at ABN AMRO.  Also her management of the Cura√ßaohuis, the representation of Cura√ßao in the Netherlands, which falls under her responsibility, was criticized. Criticism in the latter case was related to nepotism and harassment of her deputy.  A report of the Ombudsman of Cura√ßao  regarding the criticism resulted in a motion of the parliament of Cura√ßao \\"to immediately replace her\\" did not gain a majority.  During the formation of the second cabinet of Prime Minister Ben Whiteman in November 2015 the Party for the Restructured Antilles (PAR) was willing to join the coalition if Wiels would resign. Wiels' party Sovereign People declined this request. The PAR was then offered the post of deputy Minister Plenipotentiary and it joined the new governing coalition. A fourth report on the functioning of the Cura√ßaohuis under Wiels was highly critical. The report, and the fact that it had not been shared yet with the Estates of Cura√ßao, led to coalition parties in the Second Whiteman cabinet voicing severe critique in July 2016. The leader of the PAR, Zita Jesus-Leito, asked for the voluntary resignation or Wiels or else her dismissal by Whiteman.   Wiels was succeeded by Eunice Eisden on 23 December 2016.

His first name is sometimes seen as Spyros. Biography Prosalentis was descended from a noble Byzantine family, who fled to areas under the control of the Venetian Republic after the Fall of Constantinople. His father was Pavlos Prosalentis, who is considered to be the first significant modern Greek sculptor and, in 1811, created Greece's first art school. His earliest lessons naturally came from his father. Later, he finished his education at the Accademia di Belle Arti di Venezia. He remained in Italy until 1865 and, when he returned, received an appointment as Professor of painting at the Athens School of Fine Arts. For unknown reasons, he resigned from that position the following year and went back to Venice.Brief biography @ the National Gallery of Athens. In 1870, he won a major award at the \\"Exhibition of Fine Arts\\" in Parma, and was invited to return to Greece by King George I. He settled in Athens and immediately began to create murals in the chapel of the Old Royal Palace. In 1876, a second chair of painting was established at the School of Fine Arts and he received another appointment as Professor, this time remaining in that position until his death. Upon commission from the Royal Family of Greece, he completed several series of portraits of notable personalities from the Greek Revolution, the University of Athens, and the War and Navy Departments. He also painted some domestic genre scenes, but those are much less familiar.Œ†œÅŒøœÉŒ±ŒªŒ≠ŒΩœÑŒ∑œÇ Œ£œÄœÖœÅŒØŒ¥œâŒΩ - Œ†ŒπŒΩŒ±Œ∫ŒøŒ∏ŒÆŒ∫Œ∑ œÑŒ∑œÇ ŒëŒΩœâœÑŒ¨œÑŒ∑œÇ Œ£œáŒøŒªŒÆœÇ ŒöŒ±ŒªœéŒΩ Œ§ŒµœáŒΩœéŒΩ.

The campaigns took place in parts of what is now the Balkans, Ukraine and southern Russia. The Scythians managed to avoid a direct confrontation with the Persian army due to their mobile lifestyle and lack of any settlement (except Gelonus), while the Persians suffered losses due to the Scythians' scorched earth tactic. However, the Persians conquered much of their cultivated lands and damaged their allies, forcing the Scythians to respect the Persian force. Darius halted the advance to avoid further losses, and built a defence line. The campaign Junction of the Ionian fleet and the Persian army at the Bosphorus, in preparation for the Scythian campaign. 19th century illustration. Darius crossed the Black Sea at the Bosphorus Straits using a bridge of boats. Darius conquered large portions of Eastern Europe, even crossing the Danube to wage war on the Scythians. Darius invaded Scythia with his general Megabazus, where the Scythians evaded Darius's army, using feints and retreating eastwards while laying waste to the countryside, by blocking wells, intercepting convoys, destroying pastures and continuous skirmishes against Darius's army. Seeking to fight with the Scythians, Darius's army chased the Scythian army deep into Scythian lands, mostly in what is modern-day Ukraine, where there were no cities to conquer and no supplies to forage. In frustration Darius sent a letter to the Scythian ruler Idanthyrsus to fight or surrender. The ruler replied that he would not stand and fight with Darius, unless the Persians found and desecrated the graves of the Scythians' forefathers. Until then, they would continue their strategy as they had no cities or cultivated lands to lose. Despite the evading tactics of the Scythians, Darius' campaign was so far relatively successful. As presented by Herodotus, the tactics of the Scythians resulted in the loss of their best lands and damage to their loyal allies. The fact is thus that Darius held the initiative. As he moved eastwards in the cultivated lands of the Scythians, he remained resupplied by his fleet and lived to an extent off of the land. While moving eastwards in the European Scythian lands, he captured Gelonos, the large fortified city of the Budini, one of the allies of the Scythians, and burnt it. Towards the end of the campaign Darius crossing the Bosphorus. Achaemenid Empire at its greatest extent under Darius I Map of the world based on Herodotus' Histories Darius ordered a halt at the banks of Oarus, where he built \\"eight great forts, some eight miles distant from each other\\", no doubt as a frontier defence. As the Cambridge Ancient History: Persia, Greece and the Western Mediterranean C. 525 to 479 B.C. states, this evidently was as far eastwards as Darius intended to go, at least for the time being. After chasing the Scythians for a month, Darius's army was suffering losses due to fatigue, privation and sickness. In his Histories, Herodotus states that the ruins of the forts were still standing in his day. Concerned about losing more of his troops, Darius halted the march at the banks of the Volga River and headed towards Thrace. He had failed to bring the Scythians to a direct battle, and until he did so he did not have much reason to secure the conquered territories. The initiative still lay with him. As the tactics of evading Darius' army and scorched earth were continued by the Scythians, they had failed however completely, though Darius had failed too as still he wasn't able to bring it to a direct confrontation. He had conquered enough Scythian territory to force the Scythians to respect the Persian forces. Further reasons behind the invasion past the Danube Achaemenid soldiers fighting against either Scythians or Sogdians. Cylinder seal impression (drawing). The Greeks of Histiaeus preserve the bridge of Darius I across the Danube river. 19th century illustration. The whole area from central Thrace to Georgia and from the Ukraine to the north-east Mediterranean formed a compact area with mutual economic interests between Scythians, Thracians or Ionians, and Iranians. In strategic terms, Darius must have seen that some Scythian-type peoples extended from the Ukraine all the way to what is modern-day Uzbekistan, forming a continuum of dangerous nomadic raiders. Furthermore, control of the Black Sea recognized no international divisions. The Persians and the Greeks (many of whom lived in the Persian Empire, while another number lived in the Greek colonies in what is nowadays southern Ukraine) had a common interest in seeking to control the source of Scythian exports of gold, grain, hides, and furs. As the Cambridge Ancient History further states, Ctesias, a Greek doctor at the Persian court ca. 400 BC, wrote that before the invasion of Darius into the European Scythian lands a satrap of Cappadocia named Ariaramnes had crossed the Black Sea to the north, raiding the European Scythian regions with a fleet of thirty penteconters, returning with Scythian men and women, including the brother of a Scythian king. While some have supposed that the reason for Darius' invasions was merely to destroy the Scythian lands, the erection of a bridge over the Hellespont contradicts this; his superior fleet could have easily shipped the troops over as the Scythians had no navy at all. Date of the invasion Though Herodotus does not mention the season of the year, as the Cambridge Ancient History states, it is possible to infer it, knowing that if Darius marched from Susa in spring 513, he would have reached Chalcedon in May, and mustered his forces on the European side in June. Thus, he may have started to go beyond the Danube in late August. Aftermath \\"Scythian across the Sea\\", depicted as a soldier of the Achaemenid army circa 480 BCE on the tomb of Xerxes I at Naqsh-e Rustam. As the Cambridge History states, Darius inflicted widespread damage on the Scythians and their allies, weakened the prestige of the Royal Scythians especially, and upset the balance of power among the various peoples of the region. But because he failed to bring the Scythians to battle, he was unable to secure any territorial gains and he did not even complete the building of the forts at what could have been a frontier. The campaign was little more than an expensive stalemate. As winter now had come, Darius did not return to attack, and marched towards Thrace, towards his firmly secured territories. Some form of Persian authority perhaps remained after Darius withdrew, for the \\"Scythians across the Sea\\" (Old Persian cuneiform: êéøêé£êé†êèêêé´êéπêé°êéπêèêêé±êéºêé≠êéºêéπ, SakƒÅ tayaiya paradraya) are mentioned at Naqsh-e Rustam as one of the peoples the king conquered outside of Persia. Persian rule could have never extended beyond the Danube in any strength, however. Assessment The Scythian campaign was decisive in that the Persians abandoned the attempt to subjugate the European Scythians. Herodotus was correct in his assessment that the Scythians owed their escape to their mobility, their lack of inhabited centres, and the skill of their mounted archers. He furthermore states that their refusal to submit to Persia was due to such factors as the authoritarian power of the kings, the widespread hatred of foreigners (IV.76.1), and the ordinary man's belief that what brought him and his tribe honour was the killing of enemies. The various Scythian tribes co-operated with each other, winning support of other neighboring peoples as well. In that regard, as the Cambridge Ancient History states, they showed more of a sense of a community than the Greek city-states were to show through much of the subsequent Greco- Persian Wars.

The landscape comprises three main areas: Store Dyrehave, Gribskov and J√¶gersborg Dyrehave/J√¶gersborg Hegn. The landscape was submitted for admission on 1 August 2010. Location The three forests are all located in the North Zealand peninsula to the north of Copenhagen. J√¶gersborg Dyrehave with the fenced J√¶gersborg Hegn is closest to the capital on the peninsula's east coast. The square-shaped Store Dyrehave is located further to the north in the centre of the peninsula while Gribskov, further north still, is adjacent to Esrum S√∏. Store Dyrehave and Gribskov are not far from Frederiksborg Palace and the town of Hiller√∏d Background Par force hunting in North Zealand c. 1750, watercolour by Johan Jacob Bruun Christian VII on a par force hunt The forests and related buildings in three locations to the north of Copenhagen formed parts of a well-preserved Baroque hunting landscape designed in the late 17th and early 18th centuries for the Danish monarchs to participate in par force hunting. The history of the area for hunting dates back to the Middle Ages when the Danish kings, the church and noblemen had estates and hunting grounds in the peninsula's hilly forests and undulating farmlands. In connection with the Danish Reformation, in 1536 King Frederick II confiscated the estates belonging to the Catholic Church. From 1560, the various estates were merged in order to establish an extensive royal hunting park across the North Zealand peninsula. It was, however King Christian V who, from 1670, put his army to work on creating a par force deer park around Ibstrup Castle. In his youth, the king had experienced par force hunting in France's forest of Saint-Germain-en-Laye. He then imported hounds and huntsmen from England, renaming the castle J√¶gersborg (hunter's castle) and the estate J√¶gersborg Dyrehave (J√¶gersborg deer park). Detail from old map showing the par force hunt road network in Gribskov with two eight-way junctions One of the most important aspects of the par force hunt was that it provided a basis for demonstrating the absolute power of the monarch by developing connecting roads across the landscape. The entire North Zealand peninsula area was patterned with a Cartesian-based road system consisting of stars surrounded by distinct squares. Stone posts indicated whether roads led towards or away from the centre of the star. The mathematical approach reinforced the king's image as a representative of reason in line with Baroque ideals. The Danish orthogonal geometry of the road systems was an improvement on the star-shaped grids used in France and Germany as it provided equal access to all parts of the forest. The J√¶gersborg hunting park contained no star-shaped road networks but was instead based on the presence of a royal hunting lodge, initially known as the Hermitage or Hubertus House. In 1736, it was rebuilt in Baroque style as Ermitageslottet or the Hermitage Hunting Lodge, with a grand view over the surrounding landscape from its hilltop location. Danish Museum of Hunting and Forestry Much of the preparatory work on the UNESCO nomination was undertaken by Jette Baag√∏e, director of the Danish Museum of Hunting and Forestry in H√∏rsholm and chair of the steering group which has worked on the nomination since 2010. The museum is expected to be the site manager and principal coordinator of information and news about the Par Force heritage site. On the basis of the significant increase in visitors to Stevns Museum resulting from the inclusion of Stevns Klint as a UNESCO heritage site in 2014, Baag√∏e expects more visitors to the museums of North Zealand, especially to the Museum of Hunting and Forestry where a special exhibition will be devoted to the Par Force Hunting Landscape in October 2015.

In Mongolian wrestling, the zasuul is a wrestler's helper, also described as a trainer and a second.  Etymology  The name \\"zasuul\\" comes from the Mongolian word \\"zasah\\" (to fix).  Practice  Since Mongolian wrestling falls are sometimes close and hard to observe because of the techniques involved, their primary role is to impartially decide from a neutral vantage point who fell first. Two zasuuls are present for each bout. Their job is to analyze the match, to catch illegal moves and promote sportsmanship. They decide which wrestler went down first on a close call and are impartial. If they disagree on who fell first, they sometimes decide to restart, given no video replay. Ideally, zasuuls are not wrestlers and have no preference on who wins or loses. Sometimes during the heat of the match, they also serve as a third force so the matches go according to the rules. The zasuul holds the wrestler's hat during the match, and before the third, fifth, and seventh rounds announces the wrestler's titles. The zasuul also encourages the wrestler and engages the audience. At the beginning of the match he can imitate wild animals in a choreographed dance, and he sings songs to encourage his wrestler.

The LACTB2 protein has a metallo Œ≤-lactamase (MBL) fold, with two zinc ions in the active site.  Function  The metallo beta-lactamases were first identified in bacteria; they give some strains antibiotic resistance by degrading beta-lactam antibiotics (such as penicillins).

Clinical significance A tumor-specific LACTB2-NCOA2 fusion originating from intra-chromosomal rearrangement of chromosome 8 has been identified at both DNA and RNA levels. Unlike conventional oncogenic chimeric proteins, the fusion product lacks functional domain from respective genes, indicative of an amorphic rearrangement. This chimeric LACTB2-NCOA2 transcript was detected in 6 out of 99 (6.1%) colorectal cancer (CRC) cases, where NCOA2 was significantly downregulated. Enforced expression of wild-type NCOA2 but not the LACTB2-NCOA2 fusion protein impaired the pro-tumorigenic phenotypes of CRC cells, whereas knockdown of endogenous NCOA2 in normal colonocytes had opposite effects. Mechanistically, NCOA2 inhibited Wnt/Œ≤-catenin signaling through simultaneously upregulating inhibitors and downregulating stimulators of Wnt/Œ≤-catenin pathway. NCOA2 is a novel negative growth regulatory gene repressing the Wnt/Œ≤-catenin pathway in CRC, where recurrent fusion with LACTB2 contributes to its disruption.

The most common cellular products observed to be released in this manner are intercellular signaling molecules such as hormones or neurotransmitters. The most common examples of hormones that are secreted pulsatilely include insulin, thyrotropin, TRH, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and growth hormone (GH). In the nervous system, pulsatility is observed in oscillatory activity from pacemakers and central pattern generators. Pulsatile activity is critical to the function of many hormones in order to maintain the delicate homeostatic balance necessary for essential life processes, such as development and reproduction. Pulsatile secretion can be critical to hormone function, as evidenced by the case of GnRH agonists, which cause functional inhibition of the receptor for GnRH due to profound downregulation in response to constant stimulation. Pulsatility may function to sensitize target tissues to the hormone of interest and upregulate receptors, leading to improved responses. This heightened response may have served to improve the animal's fitness in its environment and promote its evolutionary retention. Pulsatile secretion in its various forms is observed in: *Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Gonadal axis (HPG) related hormones *Glucocorticoids *Insulin *Growth Hormone  Neuroendocrine Pulsatility  Nervous system control over hormone release is based in the hypothalamus, from which the neurons that populate the pariventricular and arcuate nuclei originate. These neurons project to the pituitary gland via the hypophysial portal system and dictate endocrine function via the four Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Glandular axes. Recent studies have begun to offer evidence that many pituitary hormones which have been observed to be released episodically are preceded by pulsatile secretion of their associated releasing hormone from the hypothalamus in a similar pulastile fashion. Novel research into the cellular mechanisms associated with pituitary hormone pulsatility, such as that observed for Leutinizing Hormone (LH) and Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH), have indicated similar pulses into the hypophyseal vessels of Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone (GnRH).  Luteinizing Hormone & Follicle Stimulating Hormone  LH is released from the pituitary gland along with FSH in response to GnRH release into the hypophyseal portal system. Pulsatile GnRH release causes pulsatile LH and FSH release to occur, which modulates and maintains appropriate levels of bioavailable gonadal hormone: testosterone in males and estradiol in females. In females the levels of LH is typically 1‚Äì20 IU/L during the reproductive period and is estimated to be 1.8‚Äì8.6 IU/L in males over 18 years of age.Mayo Medical Laboratories - Test ID: LH, Luteinizing Hormone (LH), Serum , retrieved December 2012World Health Organization Proposed International Standard for Luteinizing Hormone. WHO Expert Committee on Biological Standardization. World Health Organization. Geneva. 2003.WHO International Standard, Luteinizing Hormone, Human, Recombinant. National Institute for Biological Standards and Control.  Glucocorticoids  Regular pulses of glucocorticoids, mainly cortisol in the case of humans, are released regularly from the adrenal cortex following a circadian pattern in addition to their release as a part of the stress response. Cortisol release follows a high frequency of pulses, with amplitude being the primary variation in its release. Glucocorticoid pulsatlity has been observed to follow a circadian rhythm, with highest levels observed before waking and before anticipated mealtimes. This pattern in amplitude of release is observed to be consistent across vertebrates. Studies done in humans, rats, and sheep have also observed a similar circadian pattern of release of adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) shortly preceding the pulse in the resulting corticosteroid. It is currently hypothesized that the observed pulsatility of ACTH and glucocorticoids is driven via pulsatility of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), however there exists little data to support this due to difficulty in measuring CRH.  Insulin  Insulin release from The Islet of Langerhans is pulsatile with a period of 3-6 minutes. Oscillations of intracellular calcium concentration in beta cells within the pancreas produces a basal pulsatile secretion of insulin form the pancreas. Secretion pulses emanating form free beta cells not located within an islet of Lagerhans have been observed to be highly variable (2 to 10 minutes). Beta cells within an islet, however, become synchronized via electrical coupling resulting from gap junctions and osculate more regularly (3 to 6 minutes). ATP signalling has also been proposed as a method of coordination between beta cells. Pulsatile insulin secretion from individual beta cells is driven by oscillation of the calcium concentration in the cells. In beta cells lacking contact, the periodicity of these oscillations is rather variable (2-10 min). However, within an islet of Langerhans, the oscillations become synchronized by electrical coupling between closely located beta cells that are connected by gap junctions, and the periodicity is more uniform (3-6 min). In addition to gap junctions, pulse coordination is managed by ATP signaling. Œ± and Œ¥ cells in the pancreas also share secrete factors in a similar pulsatile manner.

History The 1999 UNAM strike sowed the seeds for a number of community radio stations across Mexico, including XHTYL, XHECA-FM in Amecameca, and XHCD-FM in Hermosillo. During the strike, students operated a radio station known as \\"La Ke Huelga\\". The Asociaci√≥n Civil Tierra y Libertad, a civil association founded in 1973 in response to illegal land seizures, began operating its community radio station in the summer of 2001. On June 6, 2008, the station was seized and taken off air by 150 members of the Mexican Federal Police, as it did not hold a permit to broadcast. The station began formulating an application for an official permit with Cofetel, which was granted in February 2010 along with several other applications from community radio groups across Mexico. On June 6, 2010, two years after being taken off air, the now-official XHTYL-FM came to air as a 20-watt Class D station.

After leaving St. George at the end of the 1995 ARL season, Priddle signed with the rival Super League competition during the Super League war. He later played reserve grade for Canterbury-Bankstown and the Burleigh Bears. Priddle also spent one season playing rugby league in Paris. In 2019, Priddle spoke about his time during those years saying \\"Yes, the Dragons went with the ARL but I had a meeting with Lachlan Murdoch and he explained his 'vision' for the game ... and offered to triple my salary. About that time I was having arguments with Smithy - my form was poor and I wasn't doing what he wanted out there - so with all that, it made signing with Super League an easy decision. I copped some flak but not from the players - they understood\\". \\"Not many people would ever know it, but I went to Canterbury. I played three reserve grade games in 1997, then did my knee and was out for the year. The next year they sent me to play for Paris, which was a great experience, but we got relegated and I didn't have a club anymore. For the final year of my Super League deal, Super League let me play for the Burleigh Bears. I was on $200,000 ... I think that made me the highest-paid player in the Queensland Cup by a fair way (laughs). I stayed another two years after that before hanging up the boots and getting a real job. My wage went from $200K to $32K, so it was a reality check to say the least ... I can see why a lot of players struggle post-football\\".

Cultivating proletarian literature while frequenting the Symbolist movement, he displayed both his origins in the Romanian Jewish underclass and his appreciation for the wider Romanian culture. He popularized the latter with his work in America, having left in 1913 to escape antisemitic pressures. A translator, publicist, and public lecturer, he was involved with the Romanian press of New York City, and eventually as a Romance studies academic at Columbia and Long Island. Feraru's poetry, collected in two volumes, mixes Romanian patriotism, traditionalist references, and modern industrial aesthetics.

The tanker crew was left by the pirates on a lifeboat in the sea two days after the hijacking but were subsequently rescued by Vietnamese fishing vessels on 21 November when their lifeboat was drifting around 118 nautical miles in the waters off Vietnam's southern B√† R·ªãa‚ÄìV≈©ng T√†u Province. All the pirates managed to be tracked by Vietnam Coast Guard and Vietnam People's Navy with information provided by Malaysian based International Maritime Bureau and Singaporean based RECAAP, which led to their arrest after a brief of standoff near V≈©ng T√†u port. Background The tanker was carrying 320,173 litres of light crude oil from Pasir Gudang, Johor, West Malaysia to Miri, Sarawak, East Malaysia when it was reportedly missing. Around five Myanmar nationals and four Indonesians were on board the tanker. Hijacking MT Zafirah was hijacked near the Natuna Islands, Indonesia. Around 19‚Äì20 November, the tanker was seen heading in a northerly direction with the last communication recorded at about 174.4 nautical miles () southeast of C√¥n S∆°n Island, Vietnam. RECAAP reported that all the 11 pirates were armed with machetes and pistols, and might be trying to sell the oil illegally in Vietnam. A report received by the Vietnam Coast Guard (VCG) stated that a company called \\"Petimax\\" will receive the oil from the tanker. All the tanker crew were later found on a lifeboat after having been left drifting in the sea for two days by the hijackers. They were subsequently rescued by Vietnamese fishing vessels. Searching operations Shortly after being reported missing, the Kuala Lumpur-based International Maritime Bureau informed the incident to the VCG. At around 10:06 am (UTC+07:00), the Singapore-based RECAAP reported that the latest position of the tanker was located in Vietnamese waters and that the tanker is moving at 10 nautical miles an hour. Some 24 hours after the report, the VCG was informed that the operators of the tanker had managed to anchor at a port in Vietnam to unload cargo. The VCG departed two ships along with another one on its way to the area when the tanker was detected 45 nautical miles east- southeast of C√¥n ƒê·∫£o Island. At around 2:30 am (UTC+07:00), two Vietnamese authorities vessels arrived at the site where the hijacked tanker was reportedly expected to arrive. When they spotted a suspicious tanker in the area, the VCG turned their lights to the tanker cabins but the crews on the tanker refused to respond. The VCG then tried to establish a contact with the suspicious tanker but still no response was received. After repeatedly trying to contact them, the suspicious crew on board gave inconsistent replies, saying they were on their way to China, then later that they were en route to Singapore. The VCG then ordered them to drop anchor. Aftermath After ordering the tanker to stop, the VCG found that the tanker's name was MT Sea Horse with a flag of Honduras. However, the VCG noticed strange paint on the tanker. Their suspicions were confirmed by earlier reports from MT Zafirah's captain that the tanker had been hijacked by 11 men, who were likely Indonesians; along with a report from the Piracy Reporting Centre in Malaysia that it had found no cargo vessel named the MT Sea Horse in its archives. The VCG ordered the tanker to be taken offshore for identification. After two days keeping the suspected tanker at anchor, at 3:00 pm (UTC+07:00) the suspicious crew on board the tanker suddenly started their engine. One of them were seen trying to cut the anchor in their bid to escape while another one contacted the VCG from the tanker and said \\"We are about to leave Vietnamese waters immediately\\". As a reaction, the VCG were ordered to shoot at the rooftop of the tanker's bridge. After a series of gunshots, the suspicious crew reduced the tanker's speed but still refused to leave the tower despite being told to do so. The VCG tried again to repeat the order and told them to surrender but as they were reluctant to do so, the VCG continued firing with 12.7mm machine guns and assault rifles. All the suspicious crew members began crawling out of the control tower to the prow to surrender, while the VCG counted all 11. The VCG noticed at the earlier reports that there are around 12 perpetrators and began to fear that one hijacker was still hiding in the tanker and could try to explode himself along with the tanker. The VCG threatened to shoot four of them at the prow if the remaining suspect refused to appear. When a gunshot was fired into the air, all the perpetrators cried and shouted loudly that they were only 11 strong. Five motor boats were then sent to approach the tanker and all of them were ordered to jump into the water. Within 50 minutes since the first gunshot, all 11 perpetrators were tied up and brought into one of the Vietnamese vessels. All of them were later confirmed as the hijackers. At the end of the successful mission, Major General Nguy·ªÖn Quang ƒê·∫°m was quoted in a statement about the situation; On 13 April 2013, approximately four and a half months after the incident, all the pirates were escorted to Tan Son Nhat International Airport in Ho Chi Minh City for an extradition to Indonesian authorities.

Early life Mike Snowden was born on January 1, 1970, in Lafayette, Louisiana. He grew up in Natchitoches, Louisiana, where his first guitar was a yellow toy plastic one with plastic strings from Sears Roebuck. He was the bassist in several bands as a teenager and was mentored by three older accomplished Natchitoches musicians‚ÄîDonnie Hyams, Sammy Nix, and David Dollar‚Äîwho expanded his musical horizons beyond heavy metal and recruited him to play bass with them when they performed in local bars. In 1989 shortly after graduating from high school he moved to Atlanta, Georgia, to pursue a career in music. Band de Soleil Following several false starts, he was drafted to play bass in Band de Soleil with Michelle Malone (guitar, vocals) and Danny Begay (drums).John Bush \\"Band de Soleil\\", AllMusic. He travelled extensively with the band up and down the eastern seaboard and throughout the Midwest. Band de Soleil often headlined but also opened for a number of bands, including Indigo Girls, Joe Cocker, Big Head Todd and the Monsters, the Dave Matthews Band, and others. He was with Band de Soleil from 1992 until 1996, when the band broke up. After several years of almost constant touring, Snowden was exhausted and opted to take a break to spend time with his family and to decide what his next move would be musically. Cigar box guitars After seeing a video on the Internet of someone playing a cigar box guitar, he was intrigued. He did research into the origins of cigar box guitars and how they were constructed. He built one for himself and then fashioned one for a friend. In 2007 he began handcrafting three- and four-string cigar box guitars using exotic hard woods for the necks and selling them at arts and crafts shows and from his Internet website. To date he has handcrafted close to 1,800 guitars. His customers are spread across the globe and include such well-known musicians and celebrities as Kristian Bush of Sugarland who purchased several, actor and musician Jeff Daniels, who purchased four of Snowden's guitars when he was in Atlanta filming Dumb and Dumber To,Daniels discusses buying guitars from Snowden on \\"Cigar Box Guitars!\\" Jeff Daniels with The Ben Daniels Band, Nashville, TN, January 27, 2015 on YouTube. Joe Perry of Aerosmith, comedian Anita Renfroe, and Ozzy Osbourne. In 2009 Snowden composed and recorded \\"Summer in the Fields‚ÄîCigar Box Guitar Instrumentals,\\" his first album of cigar box guitar music performed on the instruments he had built. He has put out four additional albums of original cigar box guitar music, along with a sampler of songs from his five albums; a sixth album is in the works. His CDs were produced by Jason LaFarge of Seizures Palace Recording in Brooklyn, New Jersey, and Tom Tapley of The Projector Room in Decatur, Georgia. In the summer of 2012, he was a headliner at the Boxstock Festival in Manchester, England. Boxstock is an international meeting of cigar box guitar players and enthusiasts. While in England, he performed at a number of venues. He has also given children's workshops where participants construct one-string guitars and learn to play them.\\"Natchitoches Native Will Present A Cigar Box Guitar Workshop at Junior Rangers Day,\\" Natchitoches.NET, April 8, 2014.Kevin Triebsche,\\"Cigar Box Guitar King Mike Snowden Hosts Workshop for Kids,\\" AXS, July 10, 2014.

The name Karamoana is said to be Maori,Maori Dictionary Meaning of Moana meaning \\"Rippling waters\\" and Kara was given this name in honour of her Maori nurse. Kara's family (William John Vernon and Mary Vernon n√©e Dunstone) were Australian and had moved to New Zealand for a few years for work. Her father was a blacksmith, however was in New Zealand working for the Timber industry installing boilers to power saw mills. Two years after Kara's birth the family returned to Australia (1906) and settled in Mysia, north west of Bendigo. Early life Kara was awarded a scholarship to attend Bendigo High School. After finishing school Kara became a teacher's assistant at Stuart Mill State School near St Arnaud, Victoria until she met and married William Stanley McGreevy (known as Stan) in 1925. Stan joined the army at the outbreak of World War 2. Stan served four years in the army and saw action in the Middle East.William Stanley McGreevy military records.

Parks Victoria pays tribute to Kara Moana Healey after her death. Titled :- Pioneering Life of Victorias First Female Park Ranger Celebrated Kara responded to a call from the CSIRO to collect specimens for identification for the National Herbarium. Over ten years Kara collected specimens. Exploring, alone, deep into the Tarra Valley vegetation and frequently into dangerous areas where the best-unspoilt specimens were and the egg laying nests of the lyrebird could be found. Kara became one with the natural environment around her. By 1961 Kara had collected over 160 specimens which included types of toadstool and fungi. Significantly, two new types of fungi were named after her ‚Äì Poria healeyi and Lambertella healeyi. Poria healeyi,Scientific Publication \\"Transactions of the British Mycological Society\\".

Further, Kara collected animal and insect specimens using dead animals that she found and forwarded those as well. In total over 500 specimens were collected which also included 80 species of moss. Subsequently Tarra Valley is the most thoroughly studied and recorded area in Australia at the time.National Herbarium listingsFriends of Tarra-Bulga National Park tribute to Kara Healey.https://tarrabulga.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/rbg_report.pdf Written by Peter Bryanthttps://tarrabulga.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/tribute.pdf Word Press.

Written by Mary Ryllis Clark Kara also contributed specimens to the National Museum of Victoria, the University of Melbourne and the National Herbarium. Kara became quite a celebrity through newspaper articles about her and her work, and she was acquainted with many of the leading naturalists of the day. Walters and a colleague visited Mrs Healey, as she was known, had vivid memories of her little cottage. The scientists and Kara had endless conversations regarding the natural flora and fauna of the area and Kara showed the scientists examples of where specimens were collected. Kara observed and noted the activities of the birds and animals within the park. Particularly the mating habits of the Lyrebird where the male lyre bird constructs mounds by scratching the earth, sticks and other debris into areas where he then performs his dance with his magnificent tail feathers on display to attract a female. Kara sketched all the specimens, animals and birds within the park. Photography was also used in latter years to record the specimens in their natural state. Kara had the films made into \\"slides\\" which was state of the art at the time. All of Kara's specimens and photographic libraries were handed over to Parks Victoria who have since restored, converted to digital and archived all salvageable items. At times Kara's house was an animal hospital as she rescued orphaned wombats, possums, birds and other animals, which were returned to the wild when they recovered or grew old enough to fend for themselves. Her duties at the Park included sweeping the tracks daily as the animals and birds plus the natural fall a debris covered the tracks. Visitors were greeted and the parking fee collected. As word spread in the naturalist world car loads and bus loads of people came to the park. Kara delivered a nature talk describing the plants and animals within the park. Occasionally she would summon a wild bird from high up in the tree to fly to her hand to collect a reward.Publication - Book. Triumph over the Heartbreak Hills 1880 - 2009. Published 7 February 2009.

This is now the meaning in both British and American English. *1,000,000,000,000, i.e. one million million, or (ten to the twelfth power), as defined on the long scale. This is one thousand times larger than the short scale billion, and equivalent to the short scale trillion. This is the historical definition of a billion in British English. American English adopted the short scale definition from the French. The United Kingdom used the long scale billion until 1974, when the government officially switched to the short scale, but since the 1950s the short scale had already been increasingly used in technical writing and journalism; the long scale definition still enjoys some limited usage in the UK. Other countries use the word billion (or words cognate to it) to denote either the long scale or short scale billion. For details, see Long and short scales ‚Äì Current usage. Milliard, another term for one thousand million, is still found occasionally in English, and is very common in most other European languages. For example, Bulgarian, Catalan, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, French, Georgian, German, Hebrew (Asia), Hungarian, Italian, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Slovak, Slovenian, Spanish, Swedish, Persian, Turkish and Ukrainian ‚Äî use milliard (or a related word) for the short scale billion, and billion (or a related word) for the long scale billion. Thus for these languages billion is thousand times larger than the modern English billion. However, in Russian, while milliard (–º–∏–ª–ª–∏–∞—Ä–¥) is used for the short scale billion, trillion (—Ç—Ä–∏–ª–ª–∏–æ–Ω) is used for the long scale billion. History 1000 million Mark Notgeld banknote (1923) of Frankfurt am Main According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the word billion was formed in the 16th century (from million and the prefix bi-, \\"two\\"), meaning the second power of a million (1,000,0002 = ). This long scale definition was similarly applied to trillion, quadrillion and so on. The words were originally Latin, and entered English around the end of the 17th century. Later, French arithmeticians changed the words' meanings, adopting the short scale definition whereby three zeros rather than six were added at each step, so a billion came to denote a thousand million (), a trillion (), and so on. This new convention was adopted in the United States in the 19th century, but Britain retained the original long scale use. France, in turn, reverted to the long scale in 1948. In Britain, however, under the influence of American usage, the short scale came to be increasingly used. In 1974, Prime Minister Harold Wilson confirmed that the government would use the word billion only in its short scale meaning (one thousand million). In a written answer to Robin Maxwell-Hyslop MP, who asked whether official usage would conform to the traditional British meaning of a million million, Wilson stated: \\"No. The word 'billion' is now used internationally to mean 1,000 million and it would be confusing if British Ministers were to use it in any other sense. I accept that it could still be interpreted in this country as 1 million million and I shall ask my colleagues to ensure that, if they do use it, there should be no ambiguity as to its meaning.\\" See also * Names of large numbers References Large numbers ","title":"Billion"},{"id":"47182598","text":"Edmund Wac≈Çaw Heldut - Tarnasiewicz alias \\" Heldut \\" (born July 17, 1892 in Radom, Poland and died April 2, 1952 in London, United Kingdom).

Personal Life and Legacy  In the 1920s, Tarnasiewicz married Wanda Leokadia, the daughter of a Szlachta noble Polish landowner Julian Vincent - Skalski, who has acquired the Vincent wealth. They had a daughter named Danuta (1929-2011, after her husband Brodowska, operating in the Polish National Armed Forces, later a teacher in Lublin) and a son named Andrew. Heldut-Tarnasiewicz was a very close and personal friend of J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski attending his funeral in 1935. Their cumulative war planning and effort led to the historic victory against the Soviets in the Polish- Soviet War which stopped Bolshevism in spreading into Western and other parts of Europe. The British military historian and general J. F. C. Fuller ranks the battle of Warsaw in 1920, and the Polish victory in the war, as one of the most decisive victories in history since it prevented Soviet influence from spreading to the borders of Germany, Hungary and Romania at a critical stage in these countries.Fuller, J.F.C., The Decisive Battles of the Western World, Hunter Publishing, . The Polish victory against the Soviets in 1921 was a great boost to Heldut's military career which raised him to the high rank of senior colonel of the Polish cavalry. In July 1939, he was the Commander of the prestigious Cadet School of Cavalry in Grudziadz at the Cavalry Training Centre, equivalent to USA's West Point, a position only held by a General. There he was promoted to General, but the promotion was never confirmed due to the outbreak of World War II. Throughout his military career, he continued to support the Allies of World War II in the struggle to help defeat Nazi Germany. Even when he was forced to evacuate his homeland along with the Polish government-in-exile, he trained men for the front-line against the Axis Powers all the way from the highlands of Scotland where he was commissioned and stationed. The newly installed regime of People's Republic of Poland (1947-1989) by the Soviets tried to greatly diminish the achievements and recognition of great patriotic national heroes that took part in a war against them including Heldut. Starting in 1944, he was investigated by the Regional Office of Internal Affairs in Lublin part of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Poland, created by Stalin. The new government did not recognize the Polish government-in-exile and proclaimed itself to be the legitimate government of Poland. After the war, Heldut remained in exile, residing in London, where he died on April 2, 1952. His remains were buried in Lublin.

The film follows Charlie (David Spade) and Max (Adam Sandler) after the latter fakes their deaths in order to start their lives anew. Things go awry, when they discover that the dead men whose identities they have adopted were entangled in criminal activities. Paula Patton, Kathryn Hahn, and Luis Guzm√°n also star. The film is the second in a four-film deal between Sandler and Netflix. The film was released worldwide on Netflix on May 27, 2016. Plot Charlie is an unhappily married bank manager in a supermarket who reunites with his old high school buddy and FBI agent Max at a high school reunion. They spend a weekend on a yacht Max rented, which makes Charlie feel young again. Max blows up the yacht to fake their deaths. When Charlie regains consciousness, Max explains that they can now both start new, better lives. He confesses that he is not an FBI agent and is actually a coroner. This allowed him to use two unclaimed cadavers in place of them; Charlie is given the new identity of Dr. Ronald P. Fishman, and Max takes on the new identity of Butch Ryder. Although initially appalled, Charlie has no reason to return to his old life after witnessing his lackluster funeral. Max tells Charlie that he found a key in Butch's rectum, and Charlie being a bank manager, uses a database to determine that it belongs to a safe deposit box in Puerto Rico. They travel to Puerto Rico and access Butch's safe deposit box. The box contains money and the keys to a mansion, and they relocate there. The duo learn that Ronald was married after seeing a picture of his wife on Butch's tablet. At the mansion, Max and Charlie are attacked by a group of assassins led by The Gymnast. They manage to escape, and Max reveals he lied about being a coroner, and that he is actually a guidance counselor. They return to the continental U.S. and find Ronald's widow, Heather. Max and Charlie explain to her that Ronald was murdered and infer that Butch got Ronald entangled in criminal activity. Heather informs them that Ronald's study was broken into recently. The trio head to a biker bar where Ronald and Butch used to meet up. At the bar, they learn that Butch had stage four cancer. Ronald had developed a \\"magic bullet\\" cancer treatment and they began conducting secret, non-FDA approved clinical trials. When Ronald's financier, Shecky, withdrew funding, Butch started robbing banks. They also learn from a biker that Ronald and Butch were having a love affair. The trio heads to Shecky's home where he reveals that his house was also broken into recently. The trio leave and determine that the men who tried to kill them wanted the cancer treatment formula and broke into their homes to try to find it. Charlie says they should hand over the formula when they find it, which angers Max. While hacking a computer at Ronald's laboratory, Charlie discovers that Max was one of Ronald's cancer patients. He also learns that Max has a young son with his wife, Becca, and realizes Max has been trying to recover the cure to save his own life. Max returns to Shecky's house, thinking that he is withholding the cure. Shecky has been wounded by a gunshot, but before he dies, reveals that the assassins were hired by Trojgaard, the world's largest chemotherapy company, to steal the cure and bury it. The Gymnast, still in Shecky's house, takes Max hostage. Meanwhile, Charlie goes to Becca's house and pieces together that the Jenga app on Butch's tablet was disguised to hold Ronald's cure. He attempts to call Max, but The Gymnast destroys Max's phone as he is tortured. Heather then arrives at Shecky's house and reveals to Max that she not only accepted a fortune from Trojgaard to bury the formula when Ronald refused, but also that she was the one who killed Ronald and Butch. Charlie calls Heather, and she claims Max killed Shecky. When they meet, Charlie sees through her lie, and he punches her in the face, but Heather then holds Charlie at gunpoint. Before she can shoot, Max, who had escaped and killed The Gymnast, knocks her down. Heather then holds the two at gunpoint, but Becca shows up, beats her unconscious, and recovers the tablet. The police arrive, and when they draw their weapons, Becca, holding the tablet, accidentally throws it into the nearby bay as she put up her hands. The tablet suffers irreparable damage, but it is revealed that Charlie backed up the formula to a USB. The duo are pardoned for their crimes when they offer the cancer treatment as a bargaining chip. Charlie, Max, Becca, son and mother return to the mansion in Puerto Rico after Max is cured. Cast Production Principal photography on the film began in Savannah, Georgia on July 7, 2015, and it ended on August 21, 2015. Release The film was released worldwide on Netflix on May 27, 2016. A 23-year-old accountant living in New York named Max Kessler, who looks like Adam Sandler, went viral after posting a comment to Reddit about the movie release with a photo of himself next to a photo of Sandler. Sandler responded and invited Kessler to the premiere of the film in Los Angeles. Reception On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 9% based on 23 reviews, with an average rating of 3.17/10. The website's critics consensus reads: \\"A dunderheaded story of mistaken identity, The Do-Over finds Adam Sandler and David Spade retreading old ground -- minus the comedic pep required to enliven the decidedly uninspired proceedings.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 22 out of 100, based on 11 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". Keith Uhlich of The Hollywood Reporter panned the film, and wrote: \\"it's clear that every Adam Sandler movie is dada of the high- concept, low-hanging-fruit variety, in which the Happy Madison stock company uses filmmaking (loosely termed) as an excuse to take an extended tropical vacation.\\" David Ehrlich of IndieWire gave the film a grade D- and called the film \\"atrocious in different ways than any of Adam Sandler's previous comedies\\". Ehrlich continued \\"more than two decades since Billy Madison minted Sandler as a leading man ‚Äî this restless innovator is still finding new methods of making bad movies. For years, we‚Äôve been asking Adam Sandler to try harder. We‚Äôve been making a huge mistake.\\" Christian Holub of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a positive review: \\"The plot threads can be a little hard to follow, especially since most of them revolve around two unseen characters who are dead before the story even begins, but Sandler and Spade‚Äôs partnership gives the whole enterprise enough emotional grounding to make up for it.\\" References External links * Do-Over on Netflix 2016 films American films Films directed by Steven Brill Films shot in Savannah, Georgia 2016 action comedy films Happy Madison Productions films Films produced by Adam Sandler English-language Netflix original films American action comedy films Films scored by Rupert Gregson-Williams 2016 comedy films ","title":"The Do-Over"},{"id":"47182618","text":"The Meizu MX2 is a smartphone designed and produced by the Chinese manufacturer Meizu, which runs on Flyme OS, Meizu's modified Android operating system.

Co-produced by Bowie and Ken Scott, it features Bowie's backing band known as the Spiders from Mars ‚Äì comprising guitarist Mick Ronson, bassist Trevor Bolder and drummer Mick Woodmansey. It was recorded on 12 November 1971 at Trident Studios in London and features a saxophone solo from Bowie and a guitar solo from Ronson. Lyrically, the song is about numerous characters dealing with love before the impending disaster that will destroy Earth as described in the opening track \\"Five Years\\". Since release, the song has received positive reviews from music critics, with many praising Ronson's guitar work and Bowie's sax solo. Bowie rarely performed the song live, only on occasion on the Ziggy Stardust Tour and the Serious Moonlight Tour, but was a regular on the 1978 Isolar II Tour; performances from this tour have appeared on the live albums Stage (1978) and Welcome to the Blackout (2018). The song, along with its parent album, was remastered in 2012 for its 40th anniversary and was re-released on the Five Years (1969‚Äì1973) box set in 2015. Composition and lyrics The former Trident Studios building at St Anne's Court in Soho (pictured in 2018), where \\"Soul Love\\" was recorded. Bowie recorded \\"Soul Love\\" on 12 November 1971 at Trident Studios in London. Co- produced by Ken Scott, the lineup consisted of Bowie's backing band known as the Spiders from Mars ‚Äì comprising guitarist Mick Ronson, bassist Trevor Bolder and drummer Mick Woodmansey. Author Nicholas Pegg notes that the song acknowledges Bowie's formative years, calling the riff reminiscent of \\"Stand by Me\\" by Ben E. King. He also notes that compared with the rest of the album, the song's lyrics initially stray away from the overarching story, but upon closer observation, it is about numerous characters dealing with love before the impending disaster that will destroy Earth as described in \\"Five Years\\". The song mimics the \\"portentous\\" drum rhythm of \\"Five Years\\" and features a hand-clap rhythm. Biographer Marc Spitz notes that the track has a sense of \\"pre-apocalypse frustration\\" to it. Author Peter Doggett notes that Bowie's voice sounds reminiscent of his 1977 album Low: dull, jaded, depressed and \\"sapped\\" of vitality. Other than the rare exception of \\"Lady Grinning Soul\\" from Aladdin Sane (1973), Bowie rarely used the word \\"soul\\" in his vocabulary, mainly due to his belief that the soul is vulnerable to \\"unwelcome claimants\\", as well as soulfulness being a common theme in rock music. Doggett notes that following the \\"panoramic vision\\" of \\"Five Years\\", \\"Soul Love\\" offers a more \\"optimistic\\" landscape, with bongos and acoustic guitar indicating \\"mellow fruitfulness.\\" The characters include a mother grieving at her son's grave, the son's love of the ideal for which he died (which parallels Mary grieving at Jesus's tomb), a pair of young lovers believing in \\"new words\\", and the love of \\"God on high\\". However, according to Pegg, the lyrics have a \\"nihilistic undercurrent\\" and a \\"cynical re-reading\\" of love that contrasts sharply with Bowie's previous songs: \\"he rails against 'idiot love' which 'descends on those defenseless' and bleakly concludes that 'love is not loving'.\\" Also present are themes that reflect Bowie's disdain for institutions and causes, such as the dead son that \\"gave his life to save the slogan\\", which reprises the theme of futility previously found in his 1969 song \\"Cygnet Committee\\", and prefigures \\"Tony went to fight in Belfast\\" later found in the song \\"Star\\". The lyrics also feature a priest that previously appeared in \\"Five Years\\", here \\"tastes the word\\" amid \\"the blindness that surrounds him\\", recollecting the \\"bullshit faith\\" of Bowie's 1971 song \\"Quicksand\\", which clears the way for a secularised \\"church of man, love\\" (or \\"church of man-love) found in \\"Moonage Daydream\\". Release and reception \\"Soul Love\\" was released as the second track on Bowie's fifth studio album The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars, between \\"Five Years\\" and \\"Moonage Daydream\\", on 16 June 1972 by RCA Records. Since release, the song has received positive reviews from music critics, with many praising Ronson's guitar work and Bowie's sax solo. In his book The Complete David Bowie, Pegg calls the track \\"sublimely melodic\\", giving praise to the \\"tight\\" guitar work and \\"charming\\" saxophone solo, writing \\"[it provides] a perfect bridge between the apocalyptic foreboding of 'Five Years' and the glam meltdown of 'Moonage Daydream'.\\" Doggett calls the track musically stunning, praising Ronson's guitar work and found Bowie's sax solo \\"relaxing\\". He further praises the backing vocals, writing \\"[they wailed like harpies\\", and compliments Bowie's vocal performance, noting the presence of Ziggy himself in the chorus. Ned Raggett of AllMusic gave the song a positive review, complimenting Bowie's vocal performance, calling it \\"defiantly arch\\", his sax solo, and praises Ronson's guitar work, writing, \\"his concluding solo is as perfect an example of glam-god glory as anything.\\" He identifies the \\"suddenly storming\\" choruses as the standout and notes the track as reminiscent of Bowie's previous album Hunky Dory. He ultimately called the song an \\"enjoyable listen\\", even if it's not quite connected to the overall theme of the album. Ian Fortnam of Classic Rock, when ranking every track on the album from worst to best, ranked the song at number ten (out of eleven), writing, \\"[the song] is significantly perkier than its portentous \\"Five Years\\" predecessor, but still sparkles with gorgeously under-stated Mick Ronson guitar details, Bowie's light and reedy sax break and an inspirational lyric highlighting love's all-pervasive carelessness.\\" Legacy \\"Soul Love\\" only made a few appearances on the Ziggy Stardust Tour, being played during the US portion of the tour. He revived the song for the 1978 Isolar II Tour; performances from this tour have appeared on the live albums Stage (1978) and Welcome to the Blackout (2018). The Stage version, which Pegg calls \\"excellent\\", was released as a single in Japan. Bowie also performed it on the first two shows of the Serious Moonlight Tour. The song, along with the rest of its parent album, was remastered in 2012 for its 40th anniversary and was re-released on the Five Years (1969‚Äì1973) box set in 2015.

Korb is best known for writing the music featured in Bastion, Transistor, Pyre and Hades, all of which were developed by indie developer Supergiant Games. Early life and career Korb attended Bellarmine College Preparatory high school in San Jose, California. There he would meet his longtime friend and collaborator Logan Cunningham. Having an engineering background, Korb went to New York University for music production and music business. Prior to his work with Supergiant Games, he worked on minor television and film projects. He was also a member of the NYC band Audio Fiction and was the co-founder, as well as a current member of NYC indie band, Control Group. Work with Supergiant Games Bastion (2011) A childhood friend of Supergiant Games co-founder Amir Rao, Korb was selected to write the music for Bastion. Korb describes the music on Bastion as \\"acoustic frontier trip-hop\\", combining \\"heavily sampled beats in layers, along with acoustic elements\\". On Bastion, a long-time friend of Korb's, Ashley Barrett, would provide the voice of Zia, as well as the vocals on the soundtrack. The music of Bastion was well received; Kirk Hamilton of Kotaku claimed the game had one of the best video game soundtracks of 2011. Tom Phillips of Eurogamer stated, \\"the game's musical score and innovative narration are stand-out elements.\\" Additionally, Bastion won the Spike Video Game Awards for Best Original Score and Best Song in a Game for \\"Build That Wall (Zia's Theme)\\". A physical CD version of the soundtrack was released on September 2, 2011. The soundtrack would go on to sell 30,000 copies by November 2011. Rapper Ab-Soul sampled \\"The Bottom Feeders\\" off of the Bastion soundtrack on his song, \\"Terrorist Threats\\". Transistor (2014) Korb would compose the soundtrack for Transistor, Supergiant Games' follow up to Bastion, as well. Korb described the genre of the Transistor soundtrack as \\"Old-world Electronic Post-rock\\". Korb has stated that he and his team, \\"spent a lot of time prototyping the art and audio to make sure that they were 'of a piece' this time. That was one of our goals. Bastion, I thought, turned out really nicely, but a goal on this project was to more seamlessly integrate the look and feel of the art with the feel of the audio.\\" Some of the music on soundtrack was composed to create feelings of tension; Korb has stated, \\"one thing I like to do for building tension is to have rhythmic elements that fight a bit. In 'Gateless', for example, the piece is in five but the bass line for the B section is in three, so it ends up feeling really tense. I also tend to use a lot of chords with close intervals for tension building as well.\\" GameSpot also noted that Korb used \\"dissonant chords in the upper range to create unease\\". On the instruments used in Transistor, Korb has stated that \\"there is a lot of heavily delayed electric guitar and sampled drums, but I also tried to include a number of 'old-world' instruments: accordion, harp, mandolin, etc.\\". Korb worked with Barrett once again on Transistor, as she voiced the game's protagonist, Red. On their collaboration, Korb stated, \\"after working with Ashley on a couple projects now, I feel like I've gotten a better sense of how to write for her voice. For me, that's the main consideration that affects my writing process. Our sessions are pretty laid back. If a melody line doesn't feel quite right in her voice we will change it on the fly.\\" Like Bastion, Transistor music received positive reception; TouchArcade claimed, \\"Darren Korb's music is astounding, rich and evocative as it echoes across the game and perfectly complements the bright yet mysterious world of Transistor\\". Additionally, the music in Transistor earned several industry awards nominations. In 2014 Korb received three nominations for his work on Transistor for the categories Song, Original or Adapted (We All Become was nominated, shared with Ashley Barret), Original Light Mix Score, New IP and Song Collection by National Academy of Video Game Trade Reviewers (NAVGTR). The soundtrack album was released simultaneously with the game, on May 20, 2014, selling 48,000 copies in its first 10 days of release. Pyre (2017) Korb served as the composer for the 2017 Supergiant release, Pyre. Hades (2020) Korb served as the composer for the 2020 Supergiant release, Hades, as well as the voice actor for the main character, Zagreus along with a minor character, Skelly.

He was the son of Twisted Hair, who welcomed and befriended the exhausted Lewis and Clark Expedition in 1805. His name appears as early as 1836 in a meeting with Marcus Whitman, and received the nickname \\"Lawyer\\" for his eloquence. He served as a guide for Whitman. In 1855, he took part in the Walla Walla Council and signed the Treaty of Stevens. This obtained for him a reservation to the greater part of his territory, between the Clearwater and Salmon rivers. After gold was discovered in Pierce in 1860, Lawyer agreed to new cessions of land in the Treaty of 1863, in 1868, which Old Joseph (c.1785‚Äì1871) did not accept and considered it a betrayal. Therefore, in 1872, Hallalhotsoot was displaced by Chief Joseph as the only head of the tribe. Lawyer Creek in north central Idaho, a tributary of the Clearwater River, is named for him. It carved the deep Lawyer's Canyon, between Ferdinand and Craigmont, and flows east to its mouth at Kamiah.

The book was described as a \\"classic\\" by the lawyer and historian A. G. Noorani in 2010, and as a \\"seminal work\\" on Hindu nationalism by the historian Ainslie Embree. Among critical reviewers were Marc Galanter and John T. Flint, to whom Smith published a rejoinder in 1965. Synopsis The book is divided into seven parts consisting of sixteen chapters in total. In Part 1 of the book, titled The Secular State in Perspective, Smith writes about the concept of the secular state, specifically commenting on freedom of religion, citizenship, and separation of state and religion. Smith then goes on to trace the secular state in history writing about the Church and state in the Middle Ages, the Reformation, and secularism in America and modern Europe. He then goes on to comment on the problem of secularism in Asia focusing on the nature of the major religions in Asia like Hinduism, Buddhism, and Islam. He comments on the religious minorities, the role played by the colonial powers in the Philippines, India, Indo-China, and Indonesia with respect to religion and secularism, and the role of religion in Burmese, Ceylonese, Indonesian, and Indian nationalism together with a discussion on the movement for creating Pakistan. He concludes with a discussion on secularism in Turkey. In Part 2 of the book, titled Basis for the Secular State in India, Smith comments on the relationship between State and religion in ancient and medieval India, and also during British rule. This part also has a discussion on the description of religious freedom, separation of state and religion, and citizenship in the Indian Constitution. Finally, this part concludes with a commentary on Indian nationalism, the tradition of Hindu tolerance, and western secularism. In Part 3 of the book, titled Religious Liberty and State Regulation, Smith comments on the issue of religious propagation giving different views on this issue: the general Hindu attitude, the Hindu universalist view, the Hindu communalist view, the Indian Christian view, and the humanist liberal view. He comments on the laws related to State regulation of religious propagation prior to 1950, and the provisions for the same in the Indian constitution. He also writes about legislation related to religious propagation, and the related problems of public order with respect to this issue. He then discusses the issue of foreign missionaries in India from the times of British rule to the 1956 Niyogi Committee findings and recommendations and the ensuing response. Smith then comments on the topic of public safety and regulation of religion in which he discusses the issue of suppression of anti-social religious practices by the State,the preservation of public order and restrictions on political involvement. He then describes the role of the State in reforming religion, giving the historical perspective and the problems confronting the modern Indian state in this respect. There follows a discussion on the reform of Hindu temples in which Smith discusses the reforms through legislation and judicial verdicts of animal sacrifices and temple prostitution occurring in certain Hindu temples, and also the right of Harijans to enter temples. The section concludes with a commentary on reforms in Hindu religious endowments through legislation and judicial verdicts, the role played by the central government on these issues, and finally regulation through legislation of the activities of itinerant sadhus.

It first published on May 26, 2015 through Arthur A. Levine Books and its story is told through a hybrid of traditional novel and graphic novel formats. The work is not related to the 1916 sculpture Princess X by Constantin Br√¢ncu»ôi. Synopsis May is a sad and lonely teenager who lives in Atlanta with her mother but spends summers in Seattle with her father. Years ago, before her parents divorced, when they all lived in Seattle, she and her best friend Libby worked together to create the fictional character named Princess X, a warrior-princess who went through whatever adventures the two of them could dream up. This all came to an end when Libby died in a car accident on the Ballard Bridge. Now in present day, May begins seeing stickers and other memorabilia that showcase Princess X during the summer before her 17th birthday. She's directed to a website containing stories of Princess X's exploits, all of which are similar to the stories May wrote years earlier. This leads May to believe that Libby is still alive. She decides to follow a series of subtle clues left by the webcomic with the help of Patrick Hobbs, however as she progresses, she discovers that she is not the only person looking for Libby. May discovers that Libby is indeed alive and that she was actually kidnapped by a man named Ken Mullins who wanted Libby's parents to allow her to be used as part of a medical procedure to save his own daughter, Christine Louise Mullins. They refuse due to the risk of Libby's own health and well-being, only for the man to murder Libby's parents and steal Libby away to raise in the place of his own daughter, who died soon after he was turned away. Libby managed to escape but had to remain continually on the run, as the man kept searching for her and lied to authorities, saying that she was his mentally unhinged daughter. The book ends with May and Libby reuniting, Ken in jail, and Libby adding a new character to help Princess X. Reception Critical reception for I Am Princess X has been positive. MuggleNet praised the book and wrote \\"The plot‚Äôs no Gordian knot, but Priest‚Äôs readable style, and the incorporation of a Princess X webcomic into the text itself, keeps you from getting bored with this story.

His betrayal of led to the arrest and subsequent execution of Walraven van Hall, banker and leader of the resistance. Van Lom himself was later executed by members of the resistance. Van Lom had trained as a lawyer but was unable to finish his studies during the German occupation. He found work with the lawyer Jan de Pont, whose firm, in The Hague and Amsterdam, defended Jewish families and members of the Dutch resistance. In that capacity he met a number of high-ranking resistance members, including Wim van Norden, then publisher of the illegal newspaper Het Parool. De Pont managed to get a considerable number of Parool people released after a trial, the so-called tweede Parool-proces (second Parool trial), before the German Obergericht (High Court) at Utrecht in 1944. After the trial, van Norden asked de Pont to assist him in setting up a pension fund for resistance fighters. De Pont declined because he wanted at all costs to avoid being associated with illegaliteit (nl) (illegal activity), directing him instead to van Lom, an idealistic and newly married young man. Why van Lom subsequently turned collaborator is a matter of contention among journalists and family members; one theory, subscribed to by Loe de Jong in his The Kingdom of the Netherlands During World War II and based on a confession that van Lom made when questioned by the Dutch resistance (the interrogation was led by Wim Sanders), is that van Lom had an affair with a friend of his wife and his wife's sister. According to this theory, van Lom gave up information that led to the arrest of a number of resistance members in exchange for the freedom of the young woman. He had negotiated with Friedrich Viebahn (nl) of the Sicherheitsdienst in Amsterdam that none of the people arrested were to be executed; Viebahn kept his promise, although he did not feel bound by it in the case of van Hall. Van Lom fled Amsterdam after the arrests in January 1945, and returned in March. After a meeting with a resistance member he was abducted and interrogated, and sentenced to die by poisoning. Either he refused to drink the poison or it did not have the desired effect and he was finally despatched with a shot to the neck, his body dumped in the Keizersgracht. He was 26 years old.

Biography Julian was the son of a soldier in the army of the Roman general David the Armenian and a Syrian woman. Julian grew up in the army with his father, and participated in David's campaign in Mesopotamia, for which he earned the cognomen \\"the Roman\\". Whilst in the army, he was part of a Syrian contingent under the command of Titus, which did not take part in the atrocities committed by David's soldiers at Beth Ma'de, and survived the rest of the army's destruction by withdrawing to Amida. It is suggested that Titus was fabricated by the historian Dionysius of Tel Mahre, whose work survives in the Chronicle of Michael the Syrian, to disassociate Julian from events at Beth Ma'de. After the failure of David's expedition into Mesopotamia, Julian was brought to the monastery of Qenneshre by his father, where he became a monk and was educated in Greek. He was regarded as exceptionally handsome. He succeeded Athanasius II Baldoyo as patriarch of Antioch in November 687 (AG 999), and was consecrated by Athanasius of Sarug at Amida, according to the histories of Michael the Syrian and Bar Hebraeus. The Chronicle of 846 details that he became patriarch at the monastery of Jacob of Cyrrhus. Julian's consecration is placed in 687 (AG 999) by the Chronicle of 846 and the histories of Michael the Syrian and Bar Hebraeus, whereas the Zuqnin Chronicle erroneously gives 703/704 (AG 1015). Soon after his ascension to the patriarchal office, Julian came into conflict with the archbishop Jacob of Edessa on the observance of ecclesiastical canons. Jacob had defrocked and expelled clergymen for uncanonical behaviour, but Julian advised him to treat the clergy less severely. In response, Jacob travelled to Julian's residence at the monastery of Qenneshre, where he set fire to a copy of the canon laws, criticised the patriarch for his laxity, and abdicated as archbishop of Edessa. Julian also clashed with John, archbishop of the monastery of Saint Matthew, as he had sent an archbishop to replace him upon receiving a letter from the monastery's monks that falsely stated that John had become too old and had abdicated. Eastern bishops (bishops of the former Sasanian Empire) resented Julian's actions towards John, and six bishops ordained him as archbishop of Tikrit, the highest-ranking prelate amongst the eastern bishops. Relations between Julian and the eastern bishops remained poor after John's death on 14 January 688, and his succession by Denha on 13 March in the same year. Denha, with John of Circesium, bishop of Beth Garmai, and Joseph, bishop of the Taghlib, demanded the right to ordain suffragan bishops without the patriarch's permission, thus resurrecting the controversy over ordination rights that had predominated the tenure of the Patriarch Severus II bar Masqeh. Julian restored relations with a number of eastern bishops who opposed Denha's refusal to restore the union with the Church and with the help of the Muslim authorities had Denha brought to his residence at the monastery of Qenneshre by force. Denha was imprisoned at Qenneshre for the remainder of Julian's reign, Joseph was deposed, and Bacchus, bishop of Aqula, was made responsible for Denha's diocese in his absence. Julian attended the consecration of the church of Saint Theodore at Nisibis with Simeon of the Olives, bishop of Harran, in 706/707. He subsequently died in 708 (AG 1019). 708 (AG 1019) as the year of Julian's death is unanimous in the sources, including the histories of Elijah of Nisibis and Michael the Syrian, the Chronicle of 846, and the Zuqnin Chronicle.

After the cessation of the UN and OSCE missions in Abkhazia and South Ossetia, respectively, following the August 2008 Russo‚ÄìGeorgian war, the GID remain the only platform for all interested sides to discuss security-related issues and humanitarian needs of the conflict-affected population. The commitment of non-use of force is one of the principal issues at point discussed at several GID rounds. Georgia had made a unilateral pledge of non-use of force on 23 November 2010 and has since insisted Russia should do the same. The Russian government refuses to follow the suit, alleging it is not a party to the conflict. Instead, it wants Georgia to sign treaties envisaging non-use of force directly with Abkhazia and South Ossetia, which Georgia refuses on account of the entities being part of its sovereign state. Russia has also expressed its concerns over the Georgians relations with NATO and military cooperation with the United States. Another major source of disagreement is the issue of return of internally displaced persons (IDPs) and refugees, mostly ethnic Georgians, which the Abkhaz and South Ossetian representatives, with Russian backing, reject to discuss as long as Georgia is able to secure the yearly resolutions on IDPs at the UN General Assembly. Among topics touched upon the talks are those related to language of instruction in schools in predominantly ethnic Georgian areas of Abkhazia (such as the Gali district) as well as freedom of movement and mobility, missing persons, environmental and cultural heritage.

Originally named City Church Wellington, it was founded in 2002 with seven people in a small dance and drama studio in Wellington. John and Gillian Cameron are the lead pastors of ARISE Church. ARISE Church has since expanded to include campuses in seven physical locations across New Zealand including Wellington, Hutt Valley(ARISE Centre), Hamilton, Whangarei, Kapiti, Christchurch, and Dunedin, with services based at the Wellington and Hutt Valley campuses also being streamed online. At ARISE Conference 2018 Pastor John Cameron announced that in 2019 ARISE would be launching a new campus in Palmerston North their 8th physical campus. ARISE Church has also established 2 conferences across the year. The first is Passionate Women's Conference with usually occurs in April and has close to 2,300 delegates and boasts world renowned speakers like Lisa Bevere, Leanne Mattesius, Perscilla Schrier and many more. The second is ARISE Conference where the whole of ARISE Church gathers together once a year too celebrate and encourage the Church of New Zealand as a whole Body. According to Paul Morris, Professor of Religious Studies at Victoria University, ARISE is part of a \\"religious revival\\" in New Zealand's youth culture. Radio New Zealand's youth channel, The Wireless, compared ARISE to Australia's Hillsong Church, and other papers have described ARISE as having, \\"a big youth following\\" The Church responded to the 2011 Christchurch earthquake with immediate shipments of shelf-stable food to the devastated city. ARISE Wellington now holds services every weekend in the largest indoor venues in the city, worshiping in the Michael Fowler Centre, TSB Bank Arena, and the St. James Theatre with close to 7,000 people meeting across 4 services in the Wellington Region it is the largest in Wellington. ARISE Centre The ARISE Centre is a multi-purpose auditorium and function venue built by ARISE Church with a 1,200 seat purpose built auditorium, 500 square metre foyer and caf√©, 400 square metres of auxiliary rooms and 1,200 square metres of office space on level 1. In 2015, the Church entered the permitting process for construction for the Petone building, which includes both worship and office space. The ARISE Centre is ARISE Church's first purpose built building. It is ARISE's home in the Wellington region with offices on the first floor, facilities for region wide events and a new Hutt Valley ARISE Church service on a Sunday. Built by Armstrong Downes Commercial the ARISE Centre features a largely concrete structure with 45m long steel I-beams that support the roof over the large span of the auditorium. The fa√ßade consists of glazed curtain wall that covers two sides of the building and is illuminated as a beacon with LED lighting at night. The white upper level floats above the lower level which features black aluminium joinery. The black lower level gives the building's large facade a human scale. The ground floor features exposed concrete columns and beams, and the rib and infill floor structure to level 1 is exposed as the ceiling. The lower level has black theming that links with the black aluminium windows. The upper level, the office level, has much more white due to the use of a suspended office ceiling ‚Äì employed for practicality reasons. This links well with the white aluminium joinery that runs floor to ceiling on this level. ARISE Conference ARISE Conference has become the main conference for the church and has risen to become the biggest church event ever. Beginning as a camp in 2004 and then with the ever-increasing size of ARISE Church it became impossible for them too keep it up. So in 2008 ARISE Conference took place continuing for the next 10 years and has become the largest Christian gathering in New Zealand's History. In 2011 ARISE Conference took over running the Get Smart Youth Conference from LIFE Church Auckland and it became the Largest Christian Youth conference. In 2016 the decision was made to expand it into 3 conferences in one with a Kids Conference and The Get Smart Youth Conference becoming the two additions. Also in 2017 for the first time ever ARISE Conference was held in 2 venues basically 2 conferences. 2019 marks a significant year for ARISE Conference where it launches into a second city. It was announced at ARISE Conference 2018 that the second city would be Christchurch and it would be the week of Wellington's Conference on with Christchurch beginning on 16th and finishing on the 18th of July 2019. Pathway and values In 2017 ARISE Church ventured on a new way of discipleship for current and new members of the church. This entailed a 4-week pathway program where attendees go through a process of understanding more about the faith, about their role in God's plan and advancing God's church. These four weeks are listed below and they begin on the first Sunday of every month. * Know God: discovering who God is and what it takes to become a part of the journey of faith in Jesus. * Know life: living life as a Christian, sharing faith, and living with the hope of Jesus. * Discover purpose: discovering one's spiritual gifts and becoming a part of the community of ARISE with one's giftings. * Make a difference: connection into the life of ARISE Church and developing community through servanthood and establishing the values of the A-Team in one's life.  A-Team Foundation  The serving teams at ARISE have a set of values in which members develop into as they grow. They are Love, Grow, Give, Smile, Excel and Unite. Beliefs  Theological  ARISE professes to adhere to a form of Christian theology that mostly resembles fundamental evangelical Protestantism with elements of pentecostalism. This variety of theology has its roots in Calvinism (Reformed Protestantism). They make the following affirmations as the fundamental tenets of their faith: * The Bible is the inspired word of God. * The doctrine of the Trinity. * The doctrine of the fall of man. The temptation of Adam and Eve by Satan in serpent form and consequently disobeying God by eating the fruit from the tree of knowledge. * The true and accurate rendering of the life of Jesus according to the Gospel of the New Testament. These include virgin birth, sinless life, miracles, and death and resurrection. * Salvation from sin and death by affirming that the death of Jesus by crucifixion is sufficient atonement. * The ritual of baptism in the Holy Spirit. * The need for a person to emulate the behaviour exemplified by Jesus. * The concepts of heaven and hell. * The second coming of Jesus. Controversy ARISE Church has been accused of various attempts to engage in preaching in public schools, which some argue contravenes legislation which states that teaching in New Zealand schools must be secular during school hours. A former member of the ARISE Church, Josh Barley has raised concerns about some of the methods they use, particularly in targeting youth, as well as their ideology. His observations are detailed in his blog.

Sch√∂nherr, M. Atanasov, H. Adamsky, Angular Overlap Model, in A. B. P. Lever, J. A. McCleverty, T. J. Meyer (Eds.) Comprehensive coordination chemistry II, Vol. 2. Elsevier, Oxford, 2003, pp. 443-455.) for the interpretation of optical and magnetic properties of rare-earth coordination compounds. This approach receives a renewed value in the context of the vogue around the lanthanide- based new materials, such as achieving magnets at molecular scale, or designing new phosphor materials. Biography Werner Urland was born in Berlin at 13 April 1944. Between 1963 and 1968 he studied and graduated chemistry in Giessen, Germany. The interval 1968-1971 was dedicated to the work of a doctoral thesis, under the supervision of Professor R. Hoppe, on ternary oxides of noble metals. The PhD stage incorporated a scholarship at University College in London, in the group of Dr. Malcolm Gerloch under the supervision of Professor Lord Jack Lewis (Jack Lewis, Baron Lewis of Newnham, where the acquaintance with the magnetic properties and specific models of coordination compounds had defined a turning point in his career. The following post-doctoral stage (1971-1974) in preparative solid-state chemistry and the return to England, at Cambridge, in the theory group directed by Prof. A. D. Buckingham, contoured an original composition of scientific interests, at the confluence of applied chemistry with the theoretical insight, aiming for understanding and predicting useful properties. Assimilating the different formation sources, Werner Urland contoured his original perspective in the magnetochemistry of rare earth compounds, the domain delineated by his habilitation treatise (1975-1980). Between 1982 and 1986 he occupied a research position at the Max Planck Institute for Solid State Research in Stuttgart. Since 1986 he has been appointed professor in Hanover, where he acted till his retirement in 2007, on a chair dedicated to special topics of inorganic chemistry. In 1996 he declined an invitation to occupy a position as professor of inorganic chemistry at the University of Vienna. Since 2011, Werner Urland occupies a senior researcher position on grants, in the group of theoretical and computational chemistry of Professor Claude Daul, at University of Fribourg, Switzerland. Presently, Werner Urland is dealing with setting up an institute in Muralto/Locarno, Switzerland, with the help of the \\"Sciaroni Foundation\\", dedicated to theoretical approach of material sciences and property design, thus supporting experimental work by universities and industries. Activity Preparative solid state and coordination chemistry In the branch dedicated to solid state chemistry, Werner Urland et al. synthesized and characterized structurally, by X-Ray crystallography, several lanthanide-chalcogenide systems with unusual anionic structures, such as PrSe2, PrSe1.9‚àíx, CeSe1.9‚àíx NdSe1.9 or more complex compositions, such as chalcogenide-silicates like Nd2 SeSiO4 like M 4X 3 [Si2 O 7] (M = Ce - Er; X = S, Se) The crystal structures of prototypic chalcogenides of trivalent lanthanides, like Ln2Se3 (Ln=Sm, Tb, Ho) were resolved., treating also their polymorphic manifestations and the electronic structure. Other solid phase systems such as lanthanide aluminium halides, LnAl3X12 (with Ln = lanthanide trivalent ions in the La-Ho series and X= Cl, Br) were considered as synthetic and structural problems. Another area of Werner Urland's research was contoured around the special properties of condensed systems, such as superconductivity of mixed oxide compounds, or ionic conductivity and dynamics of sodium and lanthanide ions in crystals like Na+/Ln3+-√ü\\"-Al2O3 J. K√∂hler and W. Urland Angew. Chem. 109 , 150 (1997) The same systems received attention also in the respect of their magnetic properties, in relation with the determinant structural factors. Among other approached special properties, one may mention the treatment of bipolaron absorption in Ba1‚àíxKxBiO3 and Ba0.6K0.4‚àíxBiO3 materials. Modelling breakthroughs After a brief apprenticeship in applying standard versions of ligand field modelling to transition metal complexes, tackling single-crystal polarized spectra and magnetic anisotropy of Ni(II) and Co(II) complexes in the less usual five- coordination states, Werner Urland conceived his own \\"trademark\\" devising a ligand-field potential for f electrons in the frame of Angular Overlap Model. Immediate applications clarified the meaning of the parameters, taking rare- earth hydroxides and chlorides as case studies. Many papers developed in this domain were single authored, marking the original perspective of Werner Urland. Briefly, describing the situation of Ligand field theory, practically equivalent to Crystal Field Theory pointing that this method is more popular, often invoked in qualitative respects, for transition metal systems (coordination and solid phase compounds) B. N. Figgis, M. A. Hitchman, Ligand Field Theory and its Applications, Wiley-VCH, New York, 2000 while for f-elements (lanthanide and actinide compounds) it is regarded as a rather specialized field, due to somewhat more complicated technical stances.D. J. Newman, B. K. C. Ng, Crystal Field Handbook, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2000 A conceptual drawback is the lack of chemical intuitiveness of the parameters of classical ligand field theories. There are several conventions, such as Wybourne or Stevens parameterizations B. G. Wybourne, Spectroscopic Properties of Rare Earths, Wiley Interscience, New York, 1965 An alternate offer was identified in the Angular Overlap Model basically developed for d-type transition metal systems P. E. Hoggard, Struct. Bondimg. 2004, 106, 37-57 T. Sch√∂nherr, M. Atanasov, H. Adamsky, Angular Overlap Model, in A. B. P. Lever, J. A. McCleverty, T. J. Meyer (Eds.) Comprehensive coordination chemistry II, Vol. 2. Elsevier, Oxford, 2003, pp. 443-455. It is the merit of Werner Urland for stating the AOM version for f-type compounds, advocating for it by systematic applications acting as proof for the validity of this approach. The theoretical activity was complemented by involvement in synthetic coordination chemistry, producing new coordination compounds taken as relevant new case studies for ligand field interpretation of magnetic properties. A series consisting in individual octahedral units [LnCl6]3‚àí, is interesting by the intrinsic simplicity of these complexes, once is known that lanthanide complexes are usually adopting higher coordination numbers, the hexa-coordination being enforced mostly by the doping regime, in solid lattices, such as elpasolites (a variety of Halide minerals with ABM2X3 stoichiometry). The magnetic properties of [LnCl6]3‚àí complexes (with pyridinium counter ions) were analysed in the non-trivial details of the causal role of the ligand field effects. In the same spirit, a detailed attention was devoted to the relatively simple lanthanide pentakis nitrato complexes, starting from the synthesis stage continued into the instrumental and theoretical characterization. The Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra of the pentakis nitrato ytterbate(III), [Yb(NO3)5]2‚àí was recorded and modelled, the ligand field treatment being based also on advanced neutron spectroscopy measurements. A peculiar manifestation, discovered in the light of the developed methodologies, was the first report of level crossing in ligand field diagrams, tuned by external pressure. A systematic attention was devoted to the magnetism determined by lanthanide ions in solid compounds like the ternary oxides, CsLnO2 or Cs2MLnX6 elpasolite type systems, with various combination of (M = Na, K, Rb) alkaline metal ions and (X=F, Cl, Br) halides, for several Ln(III) rare earth cases. Werner Urland proved the ligand field as the determinant for the pattern of magnetic susceptibility dependences on temperature, often mistakenly attributed to inter-center exchange coupling. A distinct branch of investigation concerned the unusual ferromagnetic Gd(III)-Gd(III) exchange coupling recorded in newly synthesized homo- polynuclear complexes of gadolinium with various carboxylates (acetate, fluoro- and chloro- substituted acetate) as bridging ligand. Recent advances Following the retirement in 2007 from Hannover professorship, Werner Urland resumed the scientific activity as guest senior researcher in the group of Professor Claude Daul at University of Fribourg (Switzerland), where he proposed a topic related to the so-called \\"Warm-White Light\\", namely the improvement of blue-type Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) towards the better resemblance to the sunlight spectrum by coating with appropriate phosphors based on lanthanide doped materials. The topic represents a hot relevance in the context of the trends of eliminating traditional incandescent light bulbs, for the sake of energy saving new technologies . This technological challenge is underlined by the award of the 2014 Nobel Prize in Physics \\"for the invention of efficient blue light-emitting diodes, which has enabled bright and energy-saving white light sources\\" to Shuji Nakamura, Isamu Akasaki and Hiroshi Amano and by the declaration of 2015 as The 'International Year of Light and Light-based Technologies, (IYL 2015). Hybridizing Werner's Urland expertise in experimental and theoretical aspects of rare earth materials with a computation and analysis methodology due to C. Daul and M. Atanasov,M. Atanansov, C. A. Daul and C. Rauzy, Struct. Bond., 2004, 106, 97 altogether with methodological knowledge of external collaborators of the group, a series of works was produced, dealing with the analysis and prediction form first principles of the key factors in the luminescence of relevant lanthanide ions in various environments. The modelling is based on a set of algorithmic steps abbreviated as LFDFT,M. Atanansov, C. A. Daul and C. Rauzy, Struct. Bond., 2004, 106, 97 consisting in non-routine calculations in the frame of Density Functional Theory (DFT) followed by the analysis in the frame of Ligand Field Theory. The issue of first principles calculations on rare-earth systems is non-trivial, because of special features of the f-shell, such as the shielded and weakly interacting nature, that poses technical and conceptual difficulties, in relation to modern methods of quantum chemistry.M. Ferbinteanu, F. Cimpoesu and S. Tanase, Struct. Bond., 2015, 163, 185-230. The specific problem of the modelling the luminescence of rare-earth systems called the need of extending the ligand field phenomenology, from its one- shell status (dedicated to d or f electrons) to a two-shell Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics), comprising simultaneously the d and f shells, because the involved optical transitions have inter-shell nature. Also recently, Werner Urland, entered the terrain of actinide chemistry, explaining intriguing magnetic behaviour due strong ligand field on uranium(IV) ions in thiophosphates and silicates. The whole deal underlines the validity and renewed value of Werner Urland's early ideas about the theoretical and practical aspects emerging from the chemistry and physics of f-elements.

She took the name of \\"Maria Vincenza\\" when she became a nun. Cardinal Angelo Amato - on behalf of Pope Benedict XVI - beatified Poloni in 2008 after the recognition of a miracle attributed to her intercession. Life Luigia Poloni was born in 1802 in Verona as the last of twelve children to Gaetano Poloni and Margherita Biadego. She was baptized hours after her birth as \\"Maria Luigia Francesca\\". She grew up in a Christian environment and was engaged in charitable acts - following in the footsteps of her father who was part of a volunteer group. Poloni came into contact with the priest Charles Steeb and found in him a friend and confidante. She confided all in him and it was through this connection that her vocation grew. The two established a religious congregation as the two envisioned and Poloni made her religious profession on 10 September 1848. She assumed the name of \\"Maria Vincenza\\" at her profession. The two aimed for the new congregation to spread the merciful love of Jesus Christ which was believed to be of paramount importance for it would lift man to full communion with God. Poloni believed that all charitable acts was something that would need to be placed as one of the top priorities in life. She - with admirable zeal - made it her mission to visit all those who were sick and orphaned. She made it her business to console them and to help them with their lives while showing them the love of Christ. She also worked with the poor and said of them: \\"the poor are our masters\\". She was hit with a tumor that consumed her at a slow pace. She underwent an operation in order to ease the pain but it failed to improve her condition. Poloni died on 11 November 1855. Legacy The congregation that Poloni and Steeb established grew outside of Verona and expanded to nations such as Portugal and Tanzania amongst others in each continent. Beatification The beatification process commenced on 12 March 1990 in Verona and the commencement of the cause conferred upon her the title of Servant of God. The process saw the accumulation of documentation that spanned from 1990 until 1993. The process - before the cause could proceed - was ratified on 3 December 1993. The Positio - a file of all documentation - was submitted to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints in Rome in 1999. Pope Benedict XVI approved her life of heroic virtue and proclaimed her to be Venerable on 28 April 2006. The miracle that was needed for her beatification was investigated in 1994 and was ratified on 7 April 1995. Benedict XVI approved the healing as a miracle on 17 December 2007 and allowed for her beatification on 21 September 2008. Cardinal Angelo Amato presided over the beatification on behalf of the pope.

Much of Jones's background, such as his residency, date of birth, and death are obscure, but he is best remembered for leading and recording with The Dallas String Band, with their most known song being the traditional Irish folk tune, \\"Drunkard's Special.\\" Jones was born sometime in the late-1880s, in Texas, and was associated with music at an early age, first with his family ensemble, which was led by his father, guitarist Coley Jones Senior. With Coley Jones split between duties as the mandolin player and an additional guitarist, the group ventured to performances in various dances, outside theaters, and town squares throughout the state. In 1903, it was first confirmed, through tentative documentation, that Jones had established residency in Dallas, where he was known to reside, until the end of the 1920s, and is presumed to remain for the majority of his life since nothing verifies a change of location. During that time, Jones began his professional career as a member of a traveling minstrel show. Between December 1927 and December 1929, Jones recorded compositions for Columbia Records, first as a solo act accompanying himself with guitar and providing vocals. Among the songs was \\"Drunkard's Special,\\" which originated (as already stated above) from Irish folk music ballads, with alternate titles including \\"The Merry Cuckold and the Kind Wife\\" and \\"Three Nights Drunk.\\" Jones's version later was featured on Harry Smith's prominent compilation album, Anthology of American Folk Music, in 1952, along with many of his contemporaries' recordings. In addition, Jones was an in-demand session musician, as he worked as a guitarist on tracks by Bobbie Cadillac and Texas Bill Day. His conspicuous presence in the music scene saw Jones as a transitional musical figure, resulting in a distinct Texas-influenced blues sound. All the while, Jones was involved in the group, the Satisfied Five, which included Herbert Cowans, and used to broadcast live from Baker Hotel and radio station WFAA. At approximately the same timeframe, Jones was also a member of the Dallas String Band, alongside Marco Washington on double bass, Sam Harris on guitar and several sidemen. The band produced ten sides during their existence, with each one displaying the group's complex instrumental abilities. The Dallas Strings later evolved into the Coley Jones String Band, notably for including T-Bone Walker. By the end of 1929, no further documentation of Jones is found though it is generally thought he still was performing in Dallas well into the 1930s.

It contains within its borders the entirety of the Dilek Peninsula as well as the large delta of the B√ºy√ºk Menderes River. The park is located in the Ku≈üadasƒ± district of Aydƒ±n Province ‚Äî part of Turkey's Aegean Region. Directly west of the national park is the small coastal town of G√ºzel√ßamlƒ±, where several shuttle buses and ferries operate to and from the district's center of Ku≈üadasƒ±, approximately 30 km (19 mi) from the park. The park is among the most biologically diverse of Turkey's national parks. It is the native and migratory habitat of hundreds of species of birds, mammals, plants, and marine life, some of which are entirely endemic to the park and cannot be observed anywhere else in the world. For these reasons, it is protected by numerous wildlife and wetland conventions, and is of great national and international importance in these areas. It is separated from the Greek island of Samos () by a very narrow strait, known as the Mycale Strait (). The strait is named after Mount Mycale, the highest and most prominent mountain of the peninsula, and is one of the narrowest straits in the Aegean Sea. History A view of the park For most of the area's existence, the lands from the Dilek Peninsula southwards to the end of the B√ºy√ºk Menderes River's large delta were uninhabited by people or very sparsely settled, and were otherwise untouched by human influence. As a result of this isolation, the area was considerably populated with numerous species of plants and wildlife, most of which still remain within the park today. Eventually, under Ancient Greek and especially Ionian influence, several settlements near Mount Mycale and the B√ºy√ºk Menderes Delta were built, such as Priene and Miletus. Nearby, Panionium was erected as the meeting place of the Ionian League. During modern times, and despite a significant increase in population and density in areas near the port town of Ku≈üadasƒ±, it was not until May 19, 1966 that the Turkish Ministry of Forest and Water Management declared Dilek Peninsula a government-protected national park. Several decades later, in 1994, the B√ºy√ºk Menderes river delta adjacent to the peninsula in the south was also promoted to national park status. Events In early 2005, a severely wounded Mediterranean monk seal (Monachus monachus) was found within the B√ºy√ºk Menderes Delta. It was treated immediately, but due to complications died shortly afterwards. The Mediterranean monk seal is critically endangered, with only about 600 remaining in the world, and over 100 of which are within the maritime borders of Turkey. Controversy surrounded the park in April 2010 after the chairman of the Aydƒ±n Beekeepers Association, Kadir Kƒ±lƒ±√ß, claimed that beekeepers would be dispatched at the national park, which had been banned since its establishment in 1966. Debate continued for a short period of time, but the dispute was soon settled, as a representative of the Governor's Office of Aydƒ±n publicly asserted the provincial government's position on the matter. They denied the claims and confirmed that beekeepers would not be introduced to the park. Beekeepers are currently not allowed as a means of conserving the abundant flora of the park, many of which rely on bees for pollination. Geography left The national park is in total land area, with the peninsula itself having an area of about , with a width of around from north to south and a length of east to west. It is located approximately from Davutlar, about from the district's seat of Ku≈üadasƒ± (estimates range from 23-30 kilometres), and is directly adjacent to the town of G√ºzel√ßamlƒ±. Other nearby cities in Aydƒ±n Province have access roads to the park, including Aydƒ±n, S√∂ke and, to a lesser extent, Didim. The Mycale Strait separates the peninsula from the nearby island of Samos. Named after Mount Mycale, the strait is only about wide at its narrowest point, making it one of the Aegean Sea's smallest straits. Popular features A view of the park with Mycale in the background The mountainous terrain of the peninsula and its numerous caverns, canyons, and valleys result in the area being of high interest to both visitors and researchers. There are several coves along the shore that have been named in order to identify them easily. Upon entering the park from the east, the first and easternmost beach available to the public is known as ƒ∞√ßmeler Cove (). This cove's waters are shallower than any other in the park, and its beaches are sandy, unlike some of the coves farther out. Therefore, it appears to be more popular amongst tourists than most of the remaining beaches and parts of Ku≈üadasƒ± are visible along the horizon from it. Aydƒ±nlƒ±k Cove is situated about further to the west, and has pebbly shores and deeper waters. It marks the transition point where the waters of the peninsula's beaches become more challenging. As a result, these beaches tend to attract more experienced swimmers and locals rather than tourists. After passing the jandarma (public safety patrol) checkpoint, a turn onto a road leads to a nearby canyon, immediately to the left. From this point on, there are several trails through the forests of the peninsula. One of them leads to the village of Doƒüanbey, and if followed further, leads to the nearby ancient Hellenistic port city of Karine. However, this path's final are limited in access, and a permit or an accompanying tour guide is required to proceed. The third cove along the peninsula, Kavaklƒ± Burun Cove, and the final, westernmost cove accessible to the public, Karasu Cove, both provide close views of the island of Samos, and are significantly less visited than the former coves of the peninsula. At the very end of the peninsula appears its tallest mountain, Mycale (), which looms over Samos and the strait of its namesake. =Cave of Zeus= Cave of Zeus near the entrance Immediately upon entry into the national park, a fork in the main path begins a trail running through the inner peninsula leading to a local cavern known as the Cave of Zeus (). The entrance is dense in vegetation, covering parts of it. There is also a wishing tree to which people usually tie objects and belongings, hoping for their wishes to be granted. The Cave of Zeus is filled with clear subterranean spring water, making it another common tourist attraction near the national park. Visits to the cave typically increase as the waters of the nearby beaches become rougher, thereby making them less inviting. The cave's name invokes the many legends that concern the cave and its origins, including one holding that Zeus bathed in the cave. =B√ºy√ºk Menderes Delta= The wide mouth of the B√ºy√ºk Menderes River () empties at the Aegean Sea, with an area of ; larger than the entire Dilek Peninsula directly to the north, at only . The B√ºy√ºk Menderes Delta is one of the most diverse wetlands in Turkey in terms of both vegetation and marine life, and is protected by several wetland agreements such as the Ramsar Convention. Its biodiversity is derived in part from the fertile lands and fresh waters of the delta, attracting numerous species to the area, including several migratory birds. The nearby mountains of the peninsula cause a marked temperature difference between the northern and southern faces of the peninsula, producing a corollary variance in the types of species found in the delta region. The area features a trail for visitors and options for canoeing and picnicking. left Climate Dilek Peninsula-B√ºy√ºk Menderes Delta National Park has a Mediterranean climate (K√∂ppen climate classification Csa), and as such, it is dry and mild throughout most of the year, except during the winters, when most of the yearly precipitation occurs. The average temperature year-round is about , ranging from average lows of in the winter to highs of around in the summer. However, on the mountaintops, as altitude increases, temperatures are usually much lower, with the annual mean temperature usually being no higher than . There are additional precipitation differences depending on elevation, and also between the north and south sides of the peninsula. Such precipitation amounts range from annually. Therefore, different species of foliage and plants live at higher altitudes than those at ground level, and the same is true when comparing the southern face of the peninsula and areas of the river delta with those to the north. Geology right The terrain of the peninsula has much to do with the geology of the Aegean Region in general. The peninsula was shaped into its current form over several geological eras with the tectonic merging of Paleozoic schist formations, Mesozoic limestone and marble deposits, and finally the accretion of large clays and other sediments during the Neogene period. This is partly because of Turkey's unstable fault block terrain, and because of the close proximity of the Anatolian-Aegean plate boundary, which generates massifs of mountains all across western Turkey. This includes the peninsula and the mountains surrounding the B√ºy√ºk Menderes River, known collectively as the Menderes Massif. The peninsula is highly mountainous, with most of its mountains having elevations close to above mean sea level. Its highest mountain, Mount Mycale, is approximately high. Biology The national park is quite diverse in its wildlife and vegetation, hosting approximately 804 distinct species of plants, 256 bird species, and an otherwise considerable variety of mammals, reptiles, and marine life. The entirety of the national park, including both Dilek Peninsula National Park and B√ºy√ºk Menderes Delta National Park, is currently protected under the Ramsar Convention, the Berne Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats, the Rio Convention on Biological Diversity, and the Barcelona Convention. Flora The park has a large diversity of vegetation. Due to the temperature and climate differences between different areas and elevations of the park, not only is the typical Aegean flora present, but also many specimens normally only found in separate coastal areas of Turkey, such as in the Mediterranean, Marmara, and Black Sea regions. Out of the 804 species of flora distributed throughout the park, six are endemic, completely exclusive to the park area, and cannot be observed anywhere else on earth, while another 30 are indigenous. The most common and widely distributed plant species throughout the national park are Mediterranean maquis shrubs such as the Phoenician juniper (Juniperus phoenicea). Other common vegetative species within the area include the oleaster-leafed pear (Pyrus elaeagnifolia), Turkish pine (Pinus brutia), and elm-leaved sumach (Rhus coriaria). left Fauna In total, 28 species of mammals, 42 species of reptiles, and 45 fish species have been documented within the park. Several wild boars (Sus scrofa) are native to the park. They are often found near the beaches where they feed on scraps and trash dropped by visitors. Further within the forests of the peninsula, other mammals can be spotted, such as golden jackals (Canis aureus), Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx), and even several striped hyenas (Hyaena hyaena) and caracals (Caracal caracal), among many others usually not native to such areas. Along the southern shores of the peninsula, and within the river delta, exists a range of bird and marine life. Many of these species are endangered, which was one of the primary factors considered when placing the delta under national protection. Some of the more common bird species observed here include pygmy cormorants (Microcarbo pygmeus), little egrets (Egretta garzetta), lesser kestrels (Falco naumanni), Kentish plovers (Charadrius alexandrinus), white-tailed eagles (Haliaeetus albicilla), and the Dalmatian pelicans (Pelecanus crispus), for which the park is a key nesting place. Marine life consists of species typical of the Aegean Sea, as well as some species usually found elsewhere. The biodiversity of local oceanic fauna is not well understood. Sea turtles and mammals, including monk seals, fin whales (only 1 sighting and 5 strandings have been documented in Turkish waters), and dolphins are considered to reside in the park area, although regularity of occurrences are unclear.Alakavuk E., ≈ûeng√ºn B., 2009, The Dilek Peninsula: B√ºy√ºk Menderes Delta, Natural Heritage from East to West, pp.315-319, Case studies from 6 EU countries.

There are several forest trails and high-elevation ventures used by hikers and mountaineers respectively. There are numerous other activities available for visitors, as well as some prohibited activities. For example, although recreational fishing is allowed, there are severe consequences for anyone found hunting within the jurisdiction of the park. Tourism The park is the most visited during the spring and summer months, when it is open between 8:00 and 19:00 (7:00 pm) local time. In autumn and winter, it closes at 17:00 (5:00 pm). Admission must be paid at the entrance. Camping, lighting fires, or setting up overnight shelters are strictly forbidden within the limits of the national park in order to protect the surrounding ecosystem. The park can be reached from the city center of Ku≈üadasƒ± via several dolmu≈ü (share taxis) that regularly shuttle the route to the closest town of G√ºzel√ßamlƒ±. Recently, there have also been ferry boat services operating back and forth between Ku≈üadasƒ± and G√ºzel√ßamlƒ±, in turn providing easier access to the park for visitors. Each year, around 700,000 foreign and domestic tourists visit the park.

Sahota holds two dozen patents for other medical inventions including Red Laser Light for prevention of Restenosis, Multi-Lobe Balloon, Fibrin coated Stent, Hemostat to stop bleeding from ruptured artery during the procedure. He holds license to promote a drug-coated stent. He performed the first coronary Angioplasty in many hospitals around the world including India, Mexico, Russia, Ukraine and the United States. He has served as the Vice Chair and Chairman of Orange County Emergency Medicine Commission in California and Research Director and Advisory Board members of the Metro Hospital Heart Institute in New Delhi, India, and Tbilisi, Republic of Georgia. Currently, he serves on the Board of Directors of Claremont Lincoln University. Early life and education Sahota was born on 15 April 1941 to Lachman Singh and Dhan Kaur in Basti Tankawali, near Ferozepur in the Indian state of Punjab, India. He was named Iqbal. Later at the age of five, his name was changed to Harvinder as a result of medical setback he suffered in which he was declared dead. Because he was revived by a physician, the event was considered a second birth requiring a new name. Sahota attended high schools and colleges in India, majoring in medicine. After completing an M.B.B.S. from the University of Punjab in 1965, Harvinder did Internship in Punjab Medical College. In 1967, he went to England to do further residency and specialization in medicine. For further specialization he enrolled as a post graduate student at the University of Liverpool where he did his specialization in tropical medicine and pulmonary in Cardiff and London Hammersmith Hospitals. Career Sahota came to the United States in 1974. He did his fellowship in cardiology at the University of Rochester in New York. Then he went to Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada to complete his chief residency. In 1977, he came to St Vincent's hospital in Los Angeles, California to do another fellowship in cardiology. After completing his second fellowship in cardiology at St. Vincent, he started his practice in cardiology in Los Angeles in 1978. He holds licenses to practice cardiology in California, New York, the United Kingdom and India. In 1985, Sahota invented \\"Sahota Perfusion Balloon\\" which allows blood to flow to the heart muscle during inflation and prevents chest pain during the operation. After getting the US FDA approval in the 1980s the balloon is now used in angioplasty surgeries all over the world. Sahota went on to invent several others devices, some non-medical, including the one with his son Neil about Identity Theft, especially for credit cards. On 17 January 1990 Sahota performed the first coronary angioplasty in North India and nine more followed in the week that the team spent in Chandigarh. After the perfusion balloon, Sahota invented Multi-lobe perfusion balloon that straightens the artery on inflation during operation preventing blockages to occur at the bend of the artery. As an inventor, he holds a total of 24 patents and many other medical inventions such as Red Laser Light for prevention of Restenosis, Fibrin coated Stent, Hemostat to stop bleeding from ruptured artery during the procedure. In 2000, Sahota received the distinguished physician award presented by former Indian Prime Minister I. K.

His father, Thomas Harrison Montgomery Sr., was a businessman and writer who authored several historical accounts and was president of the Insurance Company of North America from 1882 until his death in 1905. His mother, Anna Morton, was daughter of noted physician and naturalist Samuel George Morton. Thomas Sr. and Anna had nine children‚Äìsix sons and three daughters‚Äìof which Thomas Jr. was the sixth born. His older brother James Alan Montgomery (1866‚Äì1949) would become a noted Oriental scholar. At the age of nine, his family moved to the countryside near West Chester, Pennsylvania, where young Thomas soon began collecting field notes and bird specimens, amassing around 250 bird skins by age 15 and 450 by 17. He graduated from the Episcopal Academy in Philadelphia in 1889. In 1889, Montgomery enrolled in the University of Pennsylvania, where he studied for two years before a summer trip to Europe inspired him to complete his education in Germany, enrolling in the University of Berlin in 1891 and completing a PhD in 1894 at the age of 21. His thesis was primarily supervised by Franz Eilhard Schulze, who worked largely with sponges and other invertebrates. In 1901 Montgomery married Priscilla Braislin, and they had three sons. Priscilla Montgomery later worked as librarian of Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. Career Montgomery returned to America in early 1895 and spent three years as a researcher at the Wistar Institute in Philadelphia. During this period he spent consecutive summers working with Alexander Agassiz at his Rhode Island laboratory, the University of Pennsylvania marine laboratory at Sea Isle City, New Jersey, and at the Marine Biological Laboratory at Woods Hole, Massachusetts; the latter to which he would return nearly every summer for the rest of his life. In 1897 he joined the faculty of the University of Pennsylvania where he worked until 1903, then was professor at the University of Texas from 1903 to 1908 until returning to Pennsylvania where he worked as head of the zoology department until his death in 1912. He was a member of the American Society of Zoologists (president in 1910), American Association for the Advancement of Science, American Society of Naturalists, American Philosophical Society, Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, and the Texas Academy of Science (president in 1905). He was co- editor of the Journal of Morphology from 1908 to 1912.  Cytology  Lineus gesserensis, a ribbon worm Harrison published 25 papers on cell biology, primarily using insect cells. His most notable research includes early observations of the pairing of maternal and paternal chromosomes during cell division. He was first to propose that chromosomes play the dominant role in sex determination, although he rejected the idea that sex was determined by chromosomes alone, and some historians claim he was the first to propose the chromosome theory of inheritance, an idea widely credited to Walter Sutton and Theodor Boveri. He also detailed the morphology of the nucleolus, and observed that in some hemipteran insects the germ cells of males but not females contain odd numbers of chromosomes, which is now known to influence sex- determination, A resolution of the American Society of Zoologists read after his death stated \\"it would be impossible to write a text-book upon the role of the chromosomes in the determination of sex without referring to his crucial labors in this field.\\"  Worms, spiders, and other invertebrates  Montgomery's earliest papers concerned ribbon worms (phylum Nemertea), a group on which he would write 10 papers. He also published 10 papers on horsehair worms (phylum Nematomorpha) and two on rotifers. Montgomery wrote 14 scientific articles on spiders, and he was known to keep large amounts in his laboratory and home from which he recorded observations of courtship, mating, and other behaviors. He wrote on the taxonomy of wolf spiders (family Lycosidae), lynx spiders (Oxyopidae), and nursery web spiders (Pisauridae). In a 1909 paper detailing the anatomy and development of various organs in spiders he rejected a prevalent idea at the time that arachnids evolved from Merostomata (a now obsolete group including horseshoe crabs and the extinct eurypterids) adapting to a terrestrial life, and proposed instead that the aquatic lifestyle of horseshoe crabs evolved from terrestrial ancestors.  Birds, books, and other work  Montgomery's writings on birds included migration, feeding behavior of owls, and the importance of conservation. Other topics included general principles of animal classification and larval development of the red-backed salamander. His 1908 book, The Analysis of Racial Descent in Animals, described his ideas of classification. He contributed articles to Popular Science Monthly, and also published a memoir of his father in 1905.  Death  Montgomery was stricken with pneumonia on February 15, 1912, and died in a Philadelphia hospital on March 19, only a few days after his thirty-ninth birthday. The day of his death occurred on the opening day of the a celebration commemorating the centennial of Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia: his final paper appeared as the first article of its centennial issue.

In the Indonesian language the term bela-diri (lit. self-defense) is used to mean martial art, and in essence the Indonesian fighting arts are meant as one's defence against perceived threat and assault. Other than physical training, they often include spiritual aspects to cultivate inner strength, inner peace and higher psychological ends. Today, Indonesian fighting styles are synonymous with pencak silat, a term coined for the martial arts of the Indonesian archipelago. Nevertheless, a number of fighting arts in Indonesia are not included within the category of silat. Western misconception links silat with \\"jungle tribes\\" but in actuality, pencak silat was neither created nor traditionally practised by Indonesia's tribal inhabitants, many of whom have unique martial arts of their own. Some of these traditions have been preserved as a complete fighting system, e.g. pencak silat and kuntao. Other methods are either no longer practiced or only exist in a more sportive form such as the spear-throwing of pasola or the dance of cakalele. History Battle scene on bas-relief of Penataran, Majapahit era Some parts of the archipelagic realm that is today Indonesia was the scene of warfare among the native populace for much of its long history, and the people of the region naturally developed effective methods of combat and self-defense. Archaeological findings dating from prehistoric times have uncovered a variety of stone and metal weaponry such as axes, arrows and spearheads. These implements would have doubled as hunting tools and weapons of combat between and among tribes. Tribal warfare, although often motivated by resources, lands and slave grabbing, was also a solution to settling disputes, as well as a component of coming of age rituals. The practice of headhunting developed the martial skills of some tribes to a high level such as the Dayak, Batak, and Nias people. Warriors from militaristic tribes were appreciated by other factions, and were recruited by developed kingdoms and polities as mercenaries. Traditional war dances were used both to reenact battles and as a form of training, a precursor to the preset forms or jurus of later fighting systems. Displaced Baiyue from present-day China and Vietnam (particularly the Dong Son culture) during the first centuries of the common era introduced bronze-casting to the Nusantara and resulted in the development of native edged weapons such as the parang, klewang, mandau, badik, kujang, golok and kris. Chinese straight swords arrived early, and ancient Javanese curved swords show Indian derivation. Contact with India and the forming of ancient kingdoms lead to the transition from tribalism to the golden age that was Indonesia's Dharmic civilization. Pencak silat developed in this era, spreading quickly from Sumatra into nearly the whole of the archipelago. In comparison to the country's tribal fighting systems, pencak silat shows decidedly more influence from the Asian mainland, specifically China and the Indian subcontinent. Pencak silat tied the art of combat with practices of meditation and spiritual development, adding a new layer to the martial arts aside from merely being used to fight or kill so that it was used consistently throughout Indonesia's history. The wide geographical area in which pencak silat was practiced is naturally reflected in its diversity of techniques and weaponry, some indigenous and some adopted from outside through maritime trade. Chinese communities continued to establish themselves, their native kuntao influencing the local martial arts. Gunpowder technology in cannons and muskets allowed many kingdoms and polities in Indonesia to be conquered and subjugated by European power. A further influx of Chinese were brought in as labourers, increasing the proliferation of kuntao styles. But while the Europeans could effectively overtake and hold the cities, they found it impossible to control the smaller villages and roads connecting them. Indonesians took advantage of this, fighting an underground war through guerilla tactics. As guns were not widely available, indigenous blades were used in these attacks. Folklore portrays the rebels as Robin Hood-like martial artists such as Si Pitung. After Indonesia won its independence from colonization, the role of martial arts like pencak silat in nation-building was recognized. The Indonesian Pencak Silat Association (IPSI) was founded to unite the country's pencak silat schools under a single governing body. It has been incorporated into the unarmed combat training of Indonesia's polce and military, as well as being an extra-curricular activity in schools, and a combat sport in athletic events. Many of the more violent martial practices such as headhunting and duels to the death either fell out of popularity or were banned. A number of fighting styles have managed to survive by adapting. In some cases they became less lethal like pasola, or at times by being promoted as a dance for the entertainment of tourists. Systems The following are complete martial arts designed for fighting or self-defense. Pencak silat tournament in SEA Games XXVI. Pencak Silat Pencak silat is a compound of the two most commonly used words for martial arts in Indonesia. Pencak was the term used in central and east Java, while silat was used in Sumatra and Borneo. In modern usage, pencak and silat are seen as being two aspects of the same practice. Pencak is the essence of training, the outward aspect of the art. Silat is the internal essence of combat and self- defense, the true fighting application of the techniques. The earliest evidence of pencak silat is in 6th-century Riau from where it saw further development under Indian and Chinese influence in the Hindu-Buddhist kingdoms of Sumatra and Java. The art gradually spread throughout most of what is now Indonesia and reached its peak in the medieval Majapahit kingdom. Generalizations of silat techniques are difficult due to the diversity of systems. Any part of the body is used and subject to attack. Strikes, grabs, locks, and weapons are all incorporated. Training is often supplemented with internal methods of development such as meditation. Kuntao Kuntao is a Hokkien term for martial arts, in this case referring to those practised by the Tionghoa community of the Indonesian archipelago. Kuntao has a long history in the region dating back to ancient times. Such has been the influence between kuntao and pencak silat that the terms are used interchangeably in some regions. Every Chinese community in Indonesia either has or historically had some style of kuntao, but they were not taught openly until the latter half of the 20th century. Northern and southern Chinese martial arts are represented in kuntao, both from the external and internal schools. Some systems were directly imported from China and underwent little or no changes, such as thaikek (taiji), pakua (baguazhang or eight-trigram palm) and peh-ho (baihequan or white crane fist). Other popular systems originate from the same states as the Chinese communities who practice them, so that Fujian, Shandong, Kongfu and Guangdong styles dominate. Caci Caci duel using rattan whip as weapon and shield as protection. Caci (pronounced \\"chachi\\") is a form of fighting with a whip or stick. It appears to be indigenous to Flores in East Nusa Tenggara, but it is also practiced in Bali and Lombok. The art is sometimes called cacing or ende in Flores, and larik or kebat in Riung, while in Balinese it is known as ende. The term caci is said to derive from the Manggarai words ca meaning one and ci meaning test, indicating a one-on-one test between the fighters. According to local folklore, caci during festivals began with two brothers who owned a buffalo. When the younger brother fell into a deep hole, the older brother had to slaughter the buffalo to get its skin to help his sibling escape from the hole. The community celebrated this act of love with a festival in which caci matches were held. There are two types of caci: with a whip (tereng or agang) or a stick (agang). The whip may be either long or short. The short whip corresponds to the cambuk of Java and measures 3 feet in length. The long whip is 5‚Äì6 feet long and made from palm stems tied together with either rattan or strips of water buffalo hide. The stick is an undecorated piece of hardwood measuring 1-1.5 yards long and 2 inches in diameter. The shield is of round or elliptical shape. Also traditionally undecorated, it is known as giling or nggiling when made of buffalo hide and perisai kayu when made of wood. Both the whip and the stick form were traditionally practiced in Manggarai Regency, but the stick is rarely seen today. In Bali and Ngada Regency, only the stick form exists. In a caci match, the two fighters (who are always male) take turns alternately attacking and defending. The attacker is permitted three blows to any part of the anatomy, while the defender attempts to block with his shield. The defender is not allowed to attack while defending, but in the case of whip-fighting the defender may spin the whip above his head to prevent the attacker from closing in. Stick techniques are all swings without any thrusting. Caci at one time served as a form of conflict management within and between villages. Fighters are divided into the host group (ata one) and the challenger group from another village (ata pe‚Äôang or meka landang). Victory is obtained by hitting the opponent's face or head. In former times, championship bouts were held in which the object was to blind the opponent's eye. The winner is required to happily sing a quatrain while the loser replies in a low voice to show despair. Fitimaen Fitimaen is a form of stick-fighting from Buru in the Maluku Islands. The term comes from the Buru word maen which means stick. The maen are either made from rattan or from native hardwood, of which there are hundreds of varieties. Sparring sessions are short to minimise injury, and training is carefully conducted for the same reason. They may be fought with one or a pair of sticks, the length of which depends on personal preference. The first written attestation of fitimaen comes from a British naturalist who recounts that the natives are \\"adepts at quarterstaff\\" and that even children \\"practice with singular skill their cuts and thrusts\\". While spears and metal knives were also used by the Buru Alifuru for fighting, their preference has always been the fighting staff. Donn F. Draeger calls them the best stick and staff fighters in the whole of Indonesia although not a particularly combative community. The blowpipe (sumping) and bow and arrow could also be used for warfare but are generally hunting implements. Two styles of fitimaen are dominant, one from Namlea and the other from Leksula. Tinju The word tinju means fist-fighting and usually refers to western boxing. In Flores a form of boxing exists which involves four people. As two boxers fight, each is steered by a partner holding their waistband from behind. Attacks may be delivered with the open hand, closed fist, backhand, elbow, or a combination of these. Only the hands, arms and shoulders may be used. Kicks and throws are not permitted. The history of tinju is unknown but it is most common in Bajawa and most likely originated there. In earlier times, each boxer would hold a smooth round stone in one hand and wrap the hand in cloth. Matches are full-contact and victory is determined on points. Tarung Derajat Young Tarung Derajat fighters. Tarung Derajat is a full- contact martial art created by Haji Achmad Dradjat in Bandung, West Java. Developed in the 1960s, it is a hybrid system which incorporates boxing, grappling and street-fighting. Tarung Derajat is officially recognized as a national sport and used as basic training by the Indonesian Army. Tarung Derajat emphasizes punching and kicking, but is not limited to these, as grappling and sweeping are also included in its training. Practitioners are known simply as petarung meaning \\"fighter\\". Since the 1990s, Tarung Derajat has been refined as a combat sport. In 1998, the Tarung Derajat organization officially became a member of the KONI. Since then, the system has a spot in Pekan Olahraga Nasional, a national multi-sport competition held every four years. The main Tarung Derajat association, KODRAT (Keluarga Olahraga Tarung Derajat), now has sub-organizations in 22 provinces in Indonesia. It was introduced as an exhibition number in the 2011 Southeast Asian Games in Palembang, Indonesia. Related practices The following are related martial practices including combat sports, duels, ritual battles, mock combat, and war dances. All are exclusive to males unless otherwise stated. Pasola Pasola is a form of mounted spear-fighting from western Sumba. The word pasola comes from the local word for spear and derives from the Sanskrit sula. According to legend, pasola originated with a woman from the village of Waiwuang. When her husband - a local leader - left home for an extended period, she believed him to be dead and eloped with a new lover from another village. After her husband returned, the woman still chose to stay with her new lover, and the two were married. To forget their leader's sadness, the people of Waiwuang held the festival of pasola. Originally the participants rode horses and threw spears at each other in an attempt to spill blood to the ground, as a way of thanking the ancestors for a successful harvest and ensuring another prosperous rice harvest. The ritual changed over time into more of a mock battle. The spear tips are now blunt and their metal tips removed. Whereas it was once considered an honour to die during pasola, only accidental deaths occasionally occur today. The human and horse blood which used to drench the field is now solely from sacrificed pigs, dogs, and chickens. Armed police are kept on guard to prevent fights from breaking out. Beginning in the 2010s, pasola has been promoted as a \\"game\\" for visiting spectators. The event traditionally begins when a certain kind of sea worm swims to shore, signifying the end of the wet season and the beginning of crop-planting. Today, the elders decide on the date in advance for the sake of tourists. Pasola is always held for four weeks in February and March. Debus Debus is a martial art that shows immunity with sharp weapons, this is martial arts originating from the Sundanese people in the Provinces of Banten and West Java. Payuq A payuq match Payuq is the traditional Dayak form of wrestling, particularly native to the Kenyah people of East Kalimantan. The word payuq derives from the Sanskrit term bahu-yuddha and means \\"physical fighting\\". Matches are held annually during the harvest festival. The aim of a payuq match is to lift and slam the opponent to the ground. Physical strength and technique are the deciding factors in payuq. The neighbouring people of Kutai practice a sumo-like form of wrestling called bebintih meaning \\"mutual tackle\\". Matches take place in dried rice paddies after being harvested and a circle is set in the centre of the field as a ring. The aim is to push the opponent out of the circle or knock them to the ground. Wrestlers - always male - hold their opponent's loincloth and shove their shoulders against each other while using their legs to trip the opponent. Sisemba Sisemba is a kick-fighting activity practised by the Toraja of South Sulawesi. While sisemba is its formal name, it is also known as semba or sempak. Native to the Batan and Pangalla areas in the North Toraja Regency, it is today mainly seen in the Toraja cultural centre of Rantepao. The ritual of mass kick-fighting is usually performed as part of the rice harvest festival in Tana Toraja villages. According to tradition, sisemba is a prerequisite for the next successful harvest. In the practice of sisemba, hundreds of participants from two villages join hands and form lines of two or more people. They may be linked by the arms or by clasping hands. The line is not necessarily straight but may take the form of a V-shape, an inverted V-formation, a wedge, a circular arc either concave or convex, or any other shape. Once joined in line, all participants must be linked except the men on the ends of each line. Once the opposing ranks come within range, they kick at each other in an attempt to knock players out of the opponent's line. A divided line is then overwhelmed by the superior numbers of the opposing line, who maneuvre and surround stragglers. Smaller lines are however capable of more agile manoeuvres, such as sending the player at the end of a line flying through the air completely off the ground, and then pulling them back in a whip-like manner after they've struck the opponent. Any sort of kicks are allowed and any part of the body may be targeted so long as the link to the line is maintained. An individual who has been knocked out of line may get up and rejoin their line; until rejoining he is off-limits to the attacks of the opposing team. In earlier days, such an individual would be kicked into submission or until unconscious. Sisemba originated as a form of mass defence in which every man in the village repelled invaders. It served its purpose well enough that no form of pencak silat, wrestling, or any other unarmed fighting art exists in the Toraja culture. Sisemba was also used as a way of settling disputes between kampung. Victory was obtained simply by reducing the numbers of the opposing team through injury. Today it is a harvest-time festivity, performed on harvested rice fields. Matches last for several hours each day over a period of weeks during the harvest season. The winner is decided based on the superiority of technique but injuries are still frequent, particularly to the face. To ensure that the match runs smoothly, the village elders act as supervisors. If a participant or a pair of them was deemed to be too violent, the village elders will separate them from the crowd. Cakalele Cakalele war-dance of Seram. The cakelele is a male war-dance practised by the aboriginals of North and Central Maluku. Hybrid forms also exist in Sulawesi, Timor, and the Tanimbar Islands. Mentioned in native legends, it originated as a way for the warriors to celebrate after a successful raid. From the age of sixteen, village boys would study and work for 3‚Äì5 years with the kakehan, the men's secret society. The art of combat formed part of their education, as was the cakalele. While not an actual martial art, the dance has preserved some techniques and the full range of aboriginal weaponry, making it greatly important in the study of Indonesia's native fighting methods. Backed by the rhythm of the drum and gong (tifa) and fife (sulin), two opposing captains engage in mock-combat with a spear (sanokat) and long knife (lopu). Supporting warriors wield long knives and a narrow wooden shield known as salawaku. Mekare-kare Mekare-kare pandan battle in Tenganan village, Karangasem, Bali. Mageret pandan is a Balinese method of fighting using a sharp, thorny pandan club paired with a shield. It is sometimes called makare-kare in Balinese and known as perang pandan in Indonesian, literally meaning \\"pandan battle\\". Mageret pandan is practiced by the Bali Aga population of Tenganan village in Karangasem Regency. The people of Tenganan are devotees of the deity Indra. To honour Indra as a warrior god, many major religious festivals in Tenganan involve a ritualistic battle. The tradition of mageret pandan is said to have originated with King Maya Denawa who claimed himself a god greater than the entire Hindu pantheon. He forbade the people from performing their religious ceremonies, which angered the gods. Indra himself fought and defeated Maya Denawa for his blasphemy, and their battle was commemorated through mageret pandan. Today it is done as a ritual to honour the gods and the ancestors. The weapon used in mageret pandan is a 15 cm club made by tying 10-15 leaves of pandan (Pandanus amaryllifolius) together. Each of the leaves is edged with small sharp thorns. The shield is a rattan buckler. Techniques are mostly swinging strikes, but grappling is used when in-fighting. Participants compete shirtless, wearing only a sarong (kamen) and traditional headdress (udeng). According to tradition, the mageret pandan is compulsory for Tenganan males. For the young, it serves as a rite of passage into manhood; children as young as seven have participated. Kabasaran Kabasaran performer Kabasaran is a Minahasan war dance from North Sulawesi, performed by several men clad in red. Kabasaran dancers were traditionally farmers or guards who served as waranei (warriors) when the village was attacked. The waranei status along with their weapon is inherited from father to son. The basic structure of the dance consists of nine dance moves (jurus) using either the sword (santi) or spear (wengkouw). The footwork pattern consists of two steps to the left and another two to the right. Dancers are known as kawasalan indicating a pair of fighter cocks. The dance is accompanied by percussion instruments such as gongs, drums or kolintang called pa 'wasalen. Sitobo Lalang Lipa Reenactment of sitobo lalang lipa or tarung sarung, dueling in a sarong using badik, found in Bugis culture in the past. Sitobo lalang lipa or Sigajang laleng lipa is the Bugis term for a type of knife duel formerly practiced by pesilat of the Bugis-Makassar communities and also in Batak tribes. The challenger stands with a loosened sarong around him and invites the other man to step into the sarong. Knives in their right hands, the two duellists fight to the death within the confines of the sarong. This violent method was used for conflict resolution in Bugis- Makassar community in the past. If two men having disputes that can not be resolved through parley, their honour has been trespassed, and none of them admitted their mistakes, the only way to resolve this dispute is through a deadly duel in a sarong. In Bugis culture, there are three important concept that should be uphold; Ade (adat) or traditional customs, Siri (shame or self worth) or in this case one's pride and honor should be protected fiercely to avoid the shame of humiliation, and Pesse (compassion). In Bugis culture, the Siri aspect is the most dominant, thus conflict regarding one's honour might occur. This method of fighting originated in ancient India where the duellists fought with knives in their right hands while their left hands were tied together. It is unknown in what part of Southeast Asia this duel was first introduced, but it was practiced in Thailand where the fighters boxed each other with the right hands. Duelling within a sarong rather than tying the hands together appears to be unique to Indonesia. Among the Bugis and Mangkasara, the weapon used in sitobo lalang lipa is the badik. The Batak however use another type of knife known as the raut. Duelling is no longer practiced today, but reenactments of sitobo lalang lipa are still performed at cultural shows in Indonesia.

The term silat as a genre refers specifically to historical stories involving martial artists. These need not necessarily feature the silat discipline itself, but also includes Chinese wuxia and Japanese jidaigeki. The silat genre began as an oral and theatrical tradition before first being written in the form of medieval hikayat. The modern silat novel was a 20th-century evolution of the literary silat genre, giving rise to comics and eventually movies. Early silat films (as with many contemporary TV series today) placed less emphasis on the actual fights and more on drama, resulting in poor depictions of the art. This changed in the 1980s due to the popularity of radio shows featuring pencak silat experts in the old Indonesian kingdoms of Pajajaran and Majapahit circa the 14-15th century. Historical epics such as Saur Sepuh, Tutur Tinular and Misteri Gunung Merapi have been adapted both for TV and film. Indonesian cinema differentiates this from modern action films or laga. The latter may or may not include traditional fighting styles, but the modern setting makes it distinct from the silat genre proper. While Indonesian movies and TV series have always had a large following in neighbouring Malaysia and Singapore, it was the 2009 film Merantau that brought international attention to the cinematic genre and pencak silat in general. The film had a mostly positive reaction from cinema critics and generated enough interest for the lead actor to follow up with The Raid: Redemption in 2011 which received international acclaim. Its sequel The Raid 2: Berandal was similarly well-received but drew much criticism for its extreme gore, leading to the film being banned in Malaysia.

The Routes of the Olive Tree were inaugurated in 1998 as thematic cultural itineraries around the theme of the olive tree. They include local meetings with institutions and various events aiming at internationally promoting the history, gifts and civilization of the olive tree. The first experimental itineraries built bridges with the countries around the Mediterranean and with fellow travelers, friends and partners. Gradually a Euromediterranean network was built, leading to the creation of the Cultural Foundation of the same name, seated in Greece. The Cultural Foundation \\"Routes of the Olive Tree\\" firmly believes that the best possible wrapping of a product is the culture and traditions linked to it. In this regard, it also visits non olive oil producing countries, its members acting as representatives of institutions and civil society, accompanied by friends of the olive tree and the motorcycle, scientists, researchers, craftsmen, farmers and artists from all the Mediterranean countries.  Activities  Among the most active organizations on the field, the Routes of the Olive Tree have crossed more than 25 countries and have covered 130.000 kilometers of intercultural dialogue bearing \\"olive branches and civilization\\". These successful itineraries include exhibitions, cultural and business meetings, social activities, conventions, contests, as well as research and publications around the history, the symbolism and cultivation of the olive tree and the nutritious value of its products.  International recognition  The Routes of the Olive Tree were nominated \\"International Cultural Itinerary of intercultural dialogue & sustainable development\\" in 2003 by the Unesco in 2003 and \\"Great European Cultural Itinerary\\" in 2006 by the Council of Europe. They are under the auspices of the International Olive Council, the Hellenic Ministry of Culture and many other Greek and international institutions.

Background In November 1967, the Kingfisher Tactical Area of Operations (TAOR) was split in two creating the Lancaster TAOR and the Kentucky TAOR. The new Lancaster TAOR bordered the Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) to the north, the Scotland TAOR to the west and the Kentucky and Operationa Osceola to the east and contained the Marines bases of Camp Carroll, The Rockpile and Ca Lu Combat Base and was under the control of COL Joseph Lo Prete's 3rd Marine Regiment. Despite the closure of Route 9 by the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) west of Ca Lu, it remained the obvious route for any attempt to relieve the Khe Sanh Combat Base. The terrain in the Lancaster TAOR consisted of rolling hills climbing up to jungle-covered mountains. Operation The Marines task was to prevent PAVN infiltration from across the DMZ and from the west and to provide artillery and logistical support to the Marines at Khe Sanh. Aftermath Operation Lancaster concluded on 20 January 1968, PAVN losses were 46 killed for the loss of 22 Marines killed and 140 wounded.

Self-described as \\"financial hip hop\\", Bad Credit was a parody of the opulent \\"bling-bling\\" lifestyle portrayed by popular rap groups, subverting those themes into songs based on The Wall Street Journal articles and financial responsibility, exemplified by such titles as \\"Balance Your Checkbook\\". The group was also known for similarly-themed stage antics, such as keeping a paper shredder onstage in which supposed unpaid bills would be shredded and thrown about as confetti. Overview Bad Credit was spontaneously conceived one night by friends Gorney and McLaughlin when the former thought up the song title \\"Bill Gates Owes Me Five Bucks\\" and, both playing off the idea, developed the foundations of Bad Credit's gimmickry. Bad Credit first performed as part of an open mic night at the Blarney Stone Pub in Clairemont, San Diego, where they proved popular enough to be invited back for regular weekly gigs and eventually attracted the attention of Fluf frontman Otis \\"O\\" Barthoulameu, who solidified the band's line-up and booking schedule. While Gorney and McLaughlin remained Bad Credit's two constant frontmen, the group performed with a rotating backing band of guitar, bass and drums, at various points featuring members of such local San Diego bands as Reeve Oliver and The Incredible Moses Leroy, all performing under humorous stage names including Methodist Man, EZ E-Literate, Q-Pon, Dolla Bill, Mr. Mapoji and Foot, among others. With the San Diego City Beat describing them as \\"the most charming white-guy hip-hop you'll ever encounter\\", Bad Credit became a moderate success in the San Diego music scene, earning a nomination for \\"Best Hip-Hop\\" at the 2003 San Diego Music Awards and appearing several times on the XETV-TDT musical showcase Fox Rox. During the mid-2000s, Bad Credit struck up a lucrative touring partnership with the Orange County comedy rock band The Aquabats, performing at many of their Southern Californian concerts. Bad Credit's music was also regularly featured alongside The Aquabats on the sketch comedy program Mega64. Following Bad Credit's disbandment in 2008, Gorney and McLaughlin were both involved as writers on Yo Gabba Gabba!, a children's television series created and produced by The Aquabats' Christian Jacobs and Scott Schultz, and later worked as writers and on-screen performers for Jacobs' and Schultz's The Aquabats! Super Show!, where Gorney also contributed significantly to the series' composing and original songs, most of which were compiled on The Aquabats! Super Show! Television Soundtrack: Volume One, several of which feature lead vocals from Gorney. Outside of their own collaborative efforts, McLaughlin has pursued a career in comedy writing and stand-up comedy, while Gorney has pursued a musical career. In 2014, Gorney joined former My Chemical Romance singer Gerard Ways solo band as a bass guitarist, recording on his debut album Hesitant Alien. In the fall of 2019, Gorney briefly toured as a substitute bassist for The Aquabats, filling in for founding bassist Crash McLarson as his fictional cousin \\"Smash McLarson\\", and made a vocal cameo credited as Optimus Rime on their 2019 single \\"Skeleton Inside!\\", which later appeared on the band's 2020 album Kooky Spooky...In Stereo, which featured four songs co-credited to Gorney.

It is situated on the south side of the Minster Square (market square around the Freiburg Minster). It stands out clearly due to its dominant red facade.  History  The first municipal merchants' hall in Freiburg was built in the 14th century as a custom office. It was situated in the Schusterstra√üe and mentioned in 1378 for the first time in an official document. The building has retained in its present-day form since 1520. At that time the back of the original building was extended and became the new front facing the market square and Freiburg Minster. The building was completed in 1532. The architect of the building is not known, but it is assumed to be Lienhardt M√ºller (from Ettlingen). In later years, the merchants' hall underwent multiple modifications. In 1550 a balcony was added, in 1744 the merchants hall needed to be rebuilt due to bomb damage, in 1814 the facade was changed, in 1884 the building was remodeled according to the prevailing taste of the time. In 1924 the changes of 1884 were undone. Its contemporary state dated back to the extensive renovations which it underwent in 1988. From 1946 to 1947 the building served as the office of the Beratende Landesversammlung (precursor of the Baden Parliament with the task of drawing up the constitution of Baden). From 1947 to 1951 the historical merchants hall served as a legislative building for the South Baden state.  Description  The striking building with its crimson paint and extensive decoration, is situated with its eaves to the Minster Square (Freiburg im Breisgau). The high housetop with two attic stories is lined by crow-stepped gables. From the outside the four arcades with an access balcony facing the Minster are an eye-catching feature of the building. At ground level one enters through a gate a hall, which opens onto an inner courtyard. This hall is only open to the public on special occasions. Situated above the hall is one room that takes up the entire upper floor. The room has so-called arched curtain windows in the late Gothic style with the windows opening onto the market place. Two delicate, polygonal bay windows with colored tiles flank the arched curtain windows on the outside of the building. The front of the building is decorated with sculptures and the crest of the House of Habsburg, which were carved by Hans Sixt von Staufen between 1520 and 1531. The sculptures all have a baldachin and depict Maximilian I (Holy Roman Emperor), Philip I of Castile, Charles V (Holy Roman Emperor) and Ferdinand I (Holy Roman Emperor). The statues are replicas as the originals are stored away from the elements in the Basler Hof. The five emblems under each of the bay windows depict territorial dominions belonging to the House of Habsburg. Historisches Kaufhaus (Freiburg im Breisgau) jm8197.jpgMaximilian I.

The most significant room is the Emperors' Hall (Kaisersaal), which still serves as a prestigious venue and accommodates up to 350 people. The room has a painted stucco-ceiling. Portraits of the following dignitaries hang on the wall: the sovereigns of the House of Habsburg - Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor and his wife Maria Theresa, Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor and his wife Princess Isabella of Parma as well as Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor . The Emperors' Hall also features stained glass windows. Despite the prominence of the House of Habsburg, the room was not named after Austrian Emperors, but after William I, German Emperor, who dined there in the course of the inauguration of the Siegesdenkmal in 1876.Hans Schadek: Freiburg, ehemals - gestern - heute, Die Stadt im Wandhttps://de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Historisches_Kaufhaus_(Freiburg_im_Breisgau)&action;=edit#el der letzten 100 Jahre, Steinkopf Verlag, 2004, S. 58 Since 1776, the Emperors' Hall can be accessed by a stairway from the neighboring Redoutenhaus (building where dances and masquerades were held). On the first floor of the former Salt House (Salzhaus) is the foyer of the Emperors' Hall. On the second floor, the rooms of the Freiburg Society for History ( Geschichtsvereins Schau-ins-Land ) are situated. In 1878, the interiors were designed by Fritz Geiges. The inaugurational meeting of the Society for Baden Culture ( Landesverein Badische Heimat ) also took place in the Historical Merchants' Hall of Freiburg.Infotafel in der Ausstellung 100 Jahre Badische Heimat, gesehen auf dem Feldberg im Juni 2010 In the part of the merchants' hall facing the Schusterstra√üe are two smaller rooms, which are located on the first floor and can also be used for events; the Kaminzimmer accommodates up to 90 people and has an impressive fireplace from the 15th century and the Rococo Room (Rokokosaal) has capacity for up to 70 people.

Produced by Andy Jenkin, the album was the band's first release through Alcopop! Records. The band focused on creating a more guitar centric album, moving away from using samples and keyboards that featured on their previous albums. It also features their longtime touring guitarist Richard Peter Snapes, who departed the band upon its completion. Tellison recorded the album over a nine-month period, working at REX Studio's in Highbury, London with Jenkin producing his first full- length album. The album's release was preceded by pay what you want singles \\"Tact is Dead\\", released on 5 March 2015, \\"Boy\\" released on 2 July 2015 with third single \\"Wrecker\\" being released on 3 November 2015. Recording and production After finishing their record deal with Naim Edge, having their management quit, their lawyer tell the band he did not wish to represent them anymore and their booking agent quit the music industry the band made the decision to retreat back into their jobs outside of Tellison. \\"We let Tellison lie and dealt with the body blows of having everyone around you feel like you aren‚Äôt worth the effort\\" singer and guitarist Stephen Davidson explained in an interview. The band's disappointment with the performance of The Wages of Fear and their feeling that they have not been as successful as they had hoped would become a recurring theme for the Davidson and Peter Phillips' lyrics. Around a year later the band reconvened and began working on new material that was demoed by Davidson and Phillips in June 2012. After attempts to sign a new record-deal proved fruitless, the band decided to self finance the sessions. In July 2012, Davidson retreated to a \\"creaky old house by the sea\\" near Gullane, Scotland where he wrote the song \\"Wrecker\\", although had previously intended to write the entire album. The band officially began recording on 7 November 2013 with producer Andy Jenkin, a close friend of the band who was himself \\"figuring out a new studio and a new way of working\\". The band decided to work with Jenkin as they felt he could encapsulate the middle ground between the organic \\"guys in a practice room\\" or \\"punk-rock\\" sound and polished \\"pop\\". Recording took place at REX Studio in Highbury, London. The sessions for the album predominately took place between jobs. \\"I‚Äôd work ten hours a day then catch the bus to Highbury and stay in the studio until either I or Andy passed out or started shouting at each other\\" Davidson recalled. The band produced sixteen tracks during the album sessions, which was eventually narrowed down to twelve. Around six months into recording, guitarist Richard Peter Snapes left the band in order to concentrate on his career as a baker. It took the band around nine months to complete the record, which Davidson attributed to \\"I‚Äôm a stickler for detail and we spent a lot of time trying to make sure parts complimented one another\\". Music and influence The band had been touring for some time with Richard Peter Snapes, who added live keyboards, guitar and vocals therefore they decided to make the record with the full five piece band. Many of the new tracks split the lead guitar parts between both Davidson, Phillips and Snapes, instead of \\"just smashing out for chords for three minutes\\". They were influenced by bands such as The Mountain Goats, Hop Along, The Weakerthans and Drive By Truckers. Despite being their first album as a five piece, the band decided to predominately concentrate on their core instruments; guitar, bass and drums, as opposed to previous albums where they used string samples and keyboards. As with previous recording sessions Davidson wrote and sung lead vocals on the majority of songs, whilst Peter Phillips wrote and sung lead vocals on two of the album's tracks. Davidson was partly inspired by his own experiences within the band, leading to the sentiment of failure expressed on the opening track on the album \\"Letter to the Team (After Another Imperfect Season)\\". He apologised to his fellow band members, past and present for failing them before resigning from the band. \\"If this was any other pursuit or professional endeavour, I would have been fired a long time ago! Things clearly aren‚Äôt working out\\" Davidson said of his managing of Tellison which lead to the song's lyrics. The song quotes the popular line \\"Pain heals. Chicks dig scars. Glory... lasts forever\\" from the film The Replacements. The second track \\"Helix & Ferman\\" deals with fears held by Davidson of having \\"no prospects or plans\\" with references to Nabokov's novel Despair. The third track of the record \\"Boy\\" was written by Peter Phillips. Phillips was originally reluctant to work on the song, which resulted in the rest of the band demoing it without him, with Davidson singing nonsense in place of Phillips vocals. Davidson believed his bandmate sometimes \\"doesn‚Äôt appear to realise when he‚Äôs written something great\\" recalling similar circumstances with another of Phillips tracks \\"Gallery\\" from their album Contact! Contact!. The track was written in retrospect by Phillips about a past failed relationship and examining how relevant that experience should still be to his life now. Fourth track \\"Wrecker\\" was written by Davidson as a confession and apology for wrecking things and relationships. Written during a period of unemployment in July 2012 the band described the lyrics as being about \\"how people can slowly fall out of love over months and years through a thousand tiny failures to care, to pay attention to one another, to remember why you fell in love in the first place\\". \\"Tact is Dead\\" charts Davidson's first realisation that he would likely not achieve his dreams as well as his feelings of apathy, betrayal and disappointment of believing in meritocracy and that if he was polite and worked hard that he would be ok. The track reflects on Davidson's experiences working demeaning and low paying jobs after completing his degree whilst again using gallows humour in his writing with lines such as \\"throw me into a tube train, pay me the minimum wage\\". Davidson's lyrics reference Herman Melville's short story Bartleby, the Scrivener, as well as making nods to work by F. Scott Fitzgerald, Joseph Conrad and Woody Allen. The eleventh track on the album \\"My Marengo\\" deals with the loss of one of Davidson's best friends to suicide ten years previously. Davidson attempts to unpick both viewpoints, whether to give up on life or whether to keep on going, ultimately rejecting his friends decision to take his life. The track makes reference to Napoleon's horse Marengo which Napoleon named after Battle of Marengo \\"to remind him that, though things might seem totally futile, there's no such thing as a lost cause\\" explained Davidson. The final track on the album \\"Tsundoku\\" was again written by Davidson. Tsundoku is a Japanese word for the act of 'constantly buying books and letting them pile up without getting the chance to read them' which Davidson related back to Tellison as a band \\"All those overlooked possibilities, all those unfulfilled potentials\\". The track began as Davidson attempting to replicate the writing style of Frances Quinlan of Hop Along, hoping to produce a track that is \\"at first seemingly jagged to the point of being almost uncomfortable that eventually reveals more and more of itself and rewards repeated listens\\". Davidson held some \\"serious and troubling reservations\\" over the track as he believed it was 98% complete. Release and promotion The first track to arrive from the sessions was in the form of standalone Christmas single \\"Snow (Don't Tell The Truth This Christmas)\\", which was released independently through online retailers on 16 December 2013. Proceeds from the single were donated to the charity Campaign Against Living Miserably. Having financed and recorded the album without a record label, the band then set out to sell the album, receiving interest from various record labels. Davidson believed many of them either weren't really interested in helping the band, or they expected the band to come to them on a \\"bended knee\\" for contracts that would have crippled them creatively and financially, joking \\"uh, a third album from a band who‚Äôve been around ages and not really done anything? I guess we‚Äôll do it, but it‚Äôs not gonna be good!\\" The band made the decision to sign to Alcopop! Records which Davidson described as a \\"no brainer\\". The band began regularly performing their new track \\"Helix & Ferman\\" at live performances in late 2012 and onwards. The first single titled \\"Tact Is Dead\\" premiered on 4 March 2015 as a free download with, an accompanying music video directed by Malcolm Greenhill. The single was also released as a limited edition cassette tape and as a digital EP on 27 April 2015, featuring three remixes of the track, as well as an acoustic demo of new track \\"Boy\\". The band also embarked on a six date UK tour in April and May in support of the single. The second single \\"Boy\\" premiered on the BBC Radio 1 Rock Show on 12 April 2015, before being released as a digital single on 2 July 2015 with b-side \\"Epi\\". The following day on 3 July 2015, the album Hope Fading Nightly was officially announced, with release scheduled for 18 September 2015 through Alcopop! Records. The album would be released on CD, digital, standard vinyl and a splatter print vinyl. Over the summer months of 2015 the band performed at Hit The Deck Festival, 2000 Trees Festival, Truck Festival and Y Not Festival. A week prior to the album's release, The Independent made the entire album available to stream online with a track-by-track guide to the album penned by Stephen Davidson. The release of the album was celebrated with a special show at St Pancras Old Church on 18 September 2015, followed by a nine date tour of the United Kingdom in support of the new record. In addition to their sold-out show at The Lexington in London on 27 September, the band also performed in-store at Banquet Records in Kingston upon Thames. Third single \\"Wrecker\\" was announced and released on 3 November 2015. The single was released as a limited bowling shirt with accompanying digital download that included the b-side \\"Black Rhyme\\". The release was accompanied by the announcing of their ten-date tour of the United Kingdom in April through until May 2016. On 5 November 2015 it was announced that the band would perform Hope Fading Nightly in its entirety at Alcopop Records own Alcopopalooza showcase on 23 January 2016 at The Windmill, Brixton. Critical reception Hope Fading Nightly has been positively received by music critics. Critics emphasised Davidson's intelligent songwriting. Writing for The Independent, Remfry Dedman called Hope Fading Nightly \\"a truly great album\\" and that \\"given the passage of time is surely destined to become a classic for those who like intelligent indie-pop underdog anthems\\". Writing for Drowned in Sound, Sammy Maine called the band \\"stronger than ever\\" despite the album being the \\"personification of the quarter-life crisis\\", believing that opening track \\"Letter to the Team\\" represented Stephen H Davidson's finest writing to date. Rob Barbour wrote for Punktastic that Hope Fading Nightly \\"might be the strongest collection of songs released by a British artist this year\\" and that \\"whether angry or heartbroken, apologetic or apoplectic, Tellison can‚Äôt help but sound achingly honest and stunningly, heartbreakingly melodic.\\" Gareth O'Malley reviewed the album for Clash Magazine calling it \\"desperate, despondent and heart wrenching listen from start to finish\\". Reviewers also highlighted the band's level of success, how it may have contributed towards creating the album as well as questioning whether Hope Fading Nightly would improve the popularity of Tellison. Antoine Omisore of Hit the Floor proclaimed that whilst the album would not propel them into the mainstream it was \\"drenched in lively melodies and suffocates you with stylishly shrewd lyrics\\". Tom Connick wrote for Upset \\"Hope Fading Nightly probably won‚Äôt bring Tellison fame and fortune\\" but affirmed it would \\"remain impossibly important to those who are privy to its charms\\" and that was sometimes more important than success. Writing for DIY Magazine, Stephen Ackroyd proclaimed \\"If Tellison were half as big as Tellison should be, they'd be currently selling out their third night straight at Brixton Academy. But if Tellison were half as big as Tellison should be, they'd not be writing albums like Hope Fading Nightly\\". Emily Laws of Bring the Noise believed that the album was \\"easily their strongest work\\" to date and that they deserved to finally start going places.

It is the third installment in the series that began with Death to Spies which was followed by its sequel Death to Spies: Moment of Truth, developed by Haggard Games and released in 2007 and 2009 respectively. The game features open maps with multiple methods to complete levels. It was released on March 1, 2016 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The name is borrowed from that of a powerful chess formation used by former World Champion Alexander Alekhine in a match against fellow grandmaster Aron Nimzowitsch. Gameplay Alekhine's Gun is a third- person stealth game. The title comes from a chess formation named after former World Chess Champion Alexander Alekhine. The protagonist is Semyon Strogov, designated as Agent \\"Alekhine\\", a KGB agent recruited by the CIA. The game takes place primarily during the 1960s era of the Cold War, with flashback missions set in World War II. The game features eleven missions which are set in Austria, Cuba, Florida, Germany, New York City, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and Texas. Each mission is described as being non-linear in design, featuring multiple ways of completing tasks. The plot features around historical events such as the Bay of Pigs Invasion and the assassination of U.S. President John F. Kennedy. The game allows players to choose between straightforward shootouts or more subtle stealth-orientated gameplay with the use of items such as poison and garrotes and by staging \\"accidents\\" as distractions or means of eliminating targets. Each mission can be replayed differently to improve the player's performance. At the end of each level the player receives a different ranking depending on their style of play such as \\"Maniac\\" or \\"Ghost\\". They are also graded on \\"Noise\\", \\"Violence\\", \\"Accuracy\\" and \\"Professionalism\\". In addition, points are awarded which can be used to buy or upgrade weapons and equipment. Plot On November 22, 1963, CIA officer Vincent Rambaldi commits suicide after his family is murdered an hour after President John F. Kennedy's assassination. A year earlier, KGB Colonel Semyon Strogov is questioned by his superior about his first meeting with Rambaldi. In 1943, Strogov had infiltrated Bergenhus Castle in Norway, occupied by Waffen-SS forces conducting experiments to develop a \\"super- soldier serum\\", and eliminated German scientist Dr. Hans Heinrich and his handler, SS commander Martin Fichtner. While escaping, he found Rambaldi held captive in an underground cell. After agreeing to swap documents taken from Heinrich's office in return for his freedom, the two men escaped together. A year later, Strogov is sent to a hotel in neutral Switzerland to identify and kill a mole in Soviet intelligence and retrieve stolen information from Paolo Minelli, an Italian diplomat and Abwehr contact. Upon finishing the mission, he discovers Rambaldi outside and learns that he also sought the documents but was misled by a captured Soviet operative about where Minelli was staying. The two are ambushed by Gestapo agents monitoring the hotel, and are forced to fight their way out. Afterwards, Strogov secretly shares the intel with Rambaldi. Their paths cross again when Strogov is assigned to a joint operation with the OSS. Strogov, with Rambaldi's assistance, assassinates Dr. Berthold Stoltz and his assistant Adolf Krause, both key members of the \\"Uranium Project\\", in a secret underground facility beneath Salzburg, Austria. On his way out, he is discovered by German soldiers, but Rambaldi's partner, Andrew Pearson, rescues him when he's held at gunpoint. In October 1963, Strogov and his collaboration with Rambaldi is fully reviewed by his superior and a fellow agent, KGB Lieutenant Vera Pavlova. Strogov and Vera, posing as a married couple, travel to New York and make contact with Rambaldi, who is working on exposing an anti-government conspiracy within the CIA to trigger a war between the United States and the Soviet Union. Given the code-name \\"Alekhine\\", Strogov is informed that no government official or intelligence agency should learn about his mission, otherwise he and Vera will be disavowed. Vera and Strogov rendezvous with Rambaldi, who takes them to his safe house, where he and Pearson have put together a small team of trustworthy CIA agents. Rambaldi explains to Strogov that the conspirators are working with the Mafia to sabotage American bases and defense assets. He requests that Strogov go to the Red Dragon, a social club in New York's Chinatown, where mafia soldier Paul Capello and CIA analyst Terrence Shaw are meeting to review details of the operation. Strogov sneaks in, assassinates the targets, and obtains Capello's plans. His next mission takes him to the headquarters of a biker gang in Texas, as their president, Alejandro Vargas, is a longtime CIA informant suspected of abducting a reporter investigating his gang. Strogov goes to Texas and discovers that the reporter was tortured to death. He eliminates Vargas's second-in-command Phil Munson, abducts Vargas himself, and brings him to Rambaldi. Vargas discloses the existence of training camps for preparing soldiers, but Pearson accidentally kills him in interrogation before he can reveal anything else. Strogov goes to Miami, where he kills the boss and consigliere of the Cataldo crime family, both of whom are involved in the conspiracy, while framing their rivals for the murders. Rambaldi identifies one of the camps, located just off the coast of Miami, and has Vera drive Strogov to its location, where he kills the commandant and plants tracking devices on the ships. Strogov finds that he is growing closer to Vera, who asks him to retire from the KGB after their mission is complete. Having learned that Rambaldi also intends to retire to spend more time with his family, Strogov seriously considers the possibility. A second camp, located near Cuba, is dismantled by the Cuban military after Strogov sends them a transmission from the camp's radio, kills the officer in charge, and steals sensitive documents. When he returns to find Vera, he discovers her on the verge of death, learning that the group has been betrayed. Vera dies, but not before urging Strogov to finish their mission. Forced to act alone, Strogov foils a plot by Cuban saboteurs and a disgruntled Navy captain to blow up an aircraft carrier and frame the Soviets. A few hours later, President Kennedy is killed, followed by the murder of Rambaldi's family and his suicide. Strogov finds a memo left to him by Rambaldi, deducing that Pearson is the traitor. Having anticipated this, Pearson has Strogov arrested in New York, having already contacted both the CIA and the FBI to frame him for the deaths of Rambaldi's team. Strogov breaks out of custody, steals back the evidence against him from police lockup, and abducts Pearson to question him. Pearson reveals that the two primary leaders of the conspiracy are Admiral Bruce Gardner, a senior Kennedy administration official, and an unnamed German man with ties to the Department of Defense. Strogov kills Pearson and locates the conspiracy's leaders, who have taken refuge in a high-security military bunker in an undisclosed location to finalize their plans. Strogov infiltrates the base, assassinates Gardner, and finds the office of the unnamed German. Stepping inside, he is held at gunpoint by the man, who turns out to be a former high-level Nazi officer who once ran the Bergen operation that Strogov dismantled in 1943. The latter explains that after the surrender of Germany, he deliberately surrendered to the Americans and was recruited as an American asset to work in intelligence. He used this position to resurrect his primary goal of bringing about a new world order by manipulating the United States into declaring war on Communism. Strogov kills him and exposes the conspiracy to the CIA, who arrest the other top conspirators. Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson assumes Kennedy's office and seeks a new peace with the Soviet Union. In 1964, a retired Strogov visits Vincent Rambaldi's grave, pays his homage, salutes as a fellow soldier, and quietly walks away. Development The game was first announced in 2010 by 1C Company under the title Death to Spies 3: Ghost of Moscow, developed by Haggard Games. In 2011, 1C Company withdrew from the publishing contract. Haggard Games continued developing the title. A crowdfunding campaign was launched on Indiegogo in 2013 and another on Kickstarter in 2014, both of which failed. In June 2014, Maximum Games was announced as the new publisher and developer making it their first in-house game. Release The game was originally set to be released on November 10, 2015 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One but was delayed to February 9, 2016 due to a delay with the console versions and to allow for a simultaneous worldwide release. A pre-order edition is available for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One featuring a limited edition chess piece. Then it was delayed once again to March 1, 2016. Reception Alekhine's Gun has received negative reviews from critics, scoring 36/100 on Metacritic, and 35.00% on GameRankings. Jason Bohn of Hardcore Gamer gave the game a 2 out of 5 saying, \\"The right ideas are in place, but everything about the execution falls flat on its face. Considering how much I wanted to enjoy this, the average player probably won‚Äôt be able to handle a full playthrough.\\" See also * Death to Spies, the first video game in the series. * Death to Spies: Moment of Truth, the second video game in the series.
